One of them is clearly going to be seeing much larger short term earning returns but that doesn't necessarily make the one investing heavily in renewables less attractive right?

Battery storage is expected to expand into a 20 billion dollar plus industry and Tesla is well poised to take a very large chunk of that. Again, that's not 66 billion in revenue growth like we saw for AWS and I don't think Tesla is the next Amazon. It's just to say that Tesla is more than just a car company and when you look at PE ratios you have just as much reason to look at battery storage and solar manufacturing companies as you do to look at car companies. Tesla has probably invested a greater amount into renewables than the entire capitalization of a relatively prominent company like FirstSolar. \n\nLike I said, they're probably not going to take a 35% share of a 200 billion dollar industry and what they do provide is unlikely to be as profitable as AWS but there's no doubt that renewables and energy storage have some of the better growth prospects for the next couple decades and Tesla is significantly invested there.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Over 90% of their revenue is cars.\n\nThey're a car company.

So it's a big difference if execs in question worked from home in the vicinity of Palo Alto now need to move to Austin.\n\n> It‚Äôs absolutely astonishing how people think employment contracts operate.\n\nI'm not saying contracts don't work like this, I'm just surprised they do. If \"relocation or resign\" is lawful - which based on what most people here are saying is likely true - then that's a huge scale tilt towards the companies. I consider that bad.\n\n> Have you even read your own contracts?\n\nThis doesn't apply to me due to my personal circumstances.\n\n> Where the reason for firing lays on the worker, there is no increase to the assessed rate for the company.\n\nSo it makes a big difference if \"they were just fired for no reason\" vs. \"they did not want to relocate\". In other words, this is a big loophole that can be exploited really easily either by the company or a grumpy manager, without repercussions. I consider that bad.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "There‚Äôs no loop hole here. Companies relocating is a reasonable part of doing business.

Creating a culture where some people get to work from home while others have to be physically present is a dangerous direction for a company, as it can easily lead to an us and them environment, which is toxic to the company‚Äôs wellbeing\n\nI agree with 1 and 2.\n\nFor 3, I also agree, but there's an important consequence of that kind of thinking. I must digress to comment on the idea of \"everyone should be equal\", which doesn't sit well with me for three reasons:\n\n3.1 By trying to make everyone equal, you severely limit people who can do much more. E.g. in this case you're forcing people to waste time commuting instead of having them do something useful during that time. \n\n3.2 it's obvious that in practice that never happens. E.g. factory workers are working in a much worse conditions than execs, even if they are in the same building.\n\n3.3 There's actual waste created. People who otherwise would be able to avoid the commute now cannot. That creates enormous amount of pollution and stress.\n\nI don't have solutions for this point, but I still consider this a bad thing.\n\nThe meat of my argument is this point though:\n\n> 4. Deciding you want to work from home, is not being fired for no reason. \n\nThis is not true, since headquarters were moved from Palo Alto to Austin. It's not that employees are deciding to work from home, but avoiding working from a completely different place.\n\nTo summarize, let's look at these two situations:\n\n1. Employee X worked at office A, then worked from home after covid hit and is now being asked to return to office A\n\n2. Employee X worked at office A, then worked from home after covid hit, the company moved from office A to office B, now employee X is being asked to work at office B\n\nI would find it reasonable to fire an employee in situation 1 without repercussions, because nothing material changed.\n\nI would not find it reasonable in situation 2, since there's a huge difference if you worked in place A, then continued to work from home in the vicinity of A and now you're are required to work in B which is half a country away.\n\nObviously it's fine for the company to request employee X to work from office B.

What is one replacement for gasoline? Electric cars are coming, but replacing petroleum in the medium term is near impossible and will not impact demand (within the next 5 years).\n2. I follow 20+ Canadian oil stocks, NONE are increasing production more than 5-10%, with a laser like focus on returning FCF to shareholders as opposed to growing production. Cenovus recently said it will direct 100% of FCF to shareholders once debt targets are reached. \n3. Oil extraction and refining are capital intensive. With the end of the oil era still 10 years away,  investment in large production is not happening. **Fear of peak demand has created peak supply.** There are some new players, but no huge mega projects on the horizon to alleviate even current demand.\n4. OPEC can't fulfill current production quota's, so saudi's to the rescue is highly unlikely. \n5. INVENTORY NUMBERS. The US inventory numbers looks horrrrrribly tight, 15% below 5 the low end of the 5 year average. Cushing is nearly empty. The US gov has been dumping SPR barrels onto the market and can only do that for so long.\n\nAnywho, have a good one!", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "It‚Äôs only $800, but it‚Äôs money to say I did it lol. \n\n$180 oil will result in a total demand collapse moving the price to $50/barrel where it should probably be anyway. \n\nIn many cases the replacement for gasoline is not driving. Lockdowns could do that, as well as high prices. \n\nGovernments will take action against oil revenues. UK is already doing it. FUD will lower oil share prices if not oil price itself. \n\nOPEC doesn‚Äôt need to do anything, but individual states can. Iran almost has their bomb. No need to sanction when they have it. Venezuela is dying to start selling, they just need to wait till after midterms because dems are more afraid of GOP than inflation. And then there is Russia. Our shortage is China and Indian gain. There‚Äôs no shortage, there‚Äôs an artificial market interruption that is temporary in nature. \n\nAnd last but not least, this pandemic is far from over. At some point we are going to have to fight this thing like China does because our new normal is not sustainable. Too many people are sick and that‚Äôs the real reason for shortages and consequently inflation. Inflation will not be controlled until Covid is controlled.

Turns out I was late to the party. I joined at the very top almost. And from October to December, I was catching constant falling knives. By January I realized what was happening and studied up on options and more specifically puts. I was doing great and actually making money... until this month. \n\nThis month I fell for many traps, but none more than earnings. After watching Target and Walmart fall, and getting envious of the gain posts, I thought there would surely be more. I thought puts on retail was a sure bet. I was obviously wrong. I had puts on Dollar General and Dollar Tree, as well as BJs and others. They all beat. And poof! Money gone. I continued trying to recover the losses and semi revenge trading. I wasn't all wrong all the time, but never right enough. \n\nThe final nail in the coffin, which I was laying in the whole time without knowing, was this last month's rally after horrible economic data day after day. I doubled down and tripled down on puts. I did have calls as hedges, just not enough to cover all the losses. \n\nTo sum it up, I blew up my account and I'm done for now. I cannot afford to throw money away anymore. With inflation sky high and gas higher than I have ever seen it, I'm starting to feel the pain in the real world. I have a wife and three children to support. The dream of the stock market is just too much a gamble for me at this time. I know I'm not the only one.
