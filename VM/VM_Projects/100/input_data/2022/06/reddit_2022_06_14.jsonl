These were not rookie mistakes either (well, maybe some were in the early days), but I was fully aware of the risks and in some cases, aware that the most probable outcome was in fact a large loss, and I took the trade anyway. Most would not reccomend that, but if I think the odds on something are 1 in 5 and feel the payout is mispriced at 15 to 1, I'm probably taking that trade. I have no regrets on those type of trades, even the massive losers. I liked the thesis, I liked the R/R, I was okay eating the loss if it happened. If I'm pricing it correctly and the r/r was really there, eventually over time those trades add up to beng quite profitable. \n\nMost successful traders will repeat the mantra of capital preservation, \"pros focus on not losing money, amateurs focus on trying to make money\" or something like. And that's correct, to an extent, depending on the person, although I disagree with it in the context of managing my personal account. I would never manage someone else's account like I do my own. A key point here is that I can tell the difference between the two mentalies, if I want to make consistent gains I can, and if I want to make outsized occasional trades with a high lose rate but I like the overall R/R, I can, but don't ever confuse the two. The purpose of that mantra is correct in spirit though, rule 1) is always, never go bust, and never put yourself in the situation where you can't take the loss. If you want to make a large trade because you like the r/r, that's fine, but don't assume it's going to work out because you are overly confident from your regular routine, that doesn't expose you to that degree of downside.  \n\nAs to how to handle a big loss, that you are clearly shaken by. It's actually incredibly simple, and extremely difficult. Walk the fuck away, take a break. No more trades. You will just fuck yourself up even more. All your knowledge and experience will go out the window and you will be the worst trader you possibly could be, your losses will compound, and you will get stuck in a feedback loop of getting owned. So step one, is literally, take a break. Calm down. Accept it. That might take weeks or longer. My first few big losses I read a new book series (nothing to do with trading), just to get your mind off it. \n\nAfter you have accepted it and are no longer emotional, figure out wtf went wrong, and make sure it doesn't happen again. You always need to have some level of risk management, or you will 100% go bust eventually. Make some rules that prevent it from happening again. My worst losses, well, the most unnecessary anyways, always followed a big win, when I'd have a ton of windfall cash and do a bunch of shit that I never normally would have done. Now I take the day off, and then tape a $100 bill to my computer on the next session to prevent making foolish 'free money' trades. \n\nTldr: If you fucked up, take a break before you fuck up again. If you are going to take high-risk plays, be ok with a 100% loss (or more, depending on if you are selling). Use some semblance of risk management and don't confuse your bread and butter trades with going for a yolo.

I held my options for too long, expecting huge wins every single time, instead of cashing out when I was up. I took a few big losses and I kept depositing money in an attempt to make up for it. In all, I deposited about $9,000, and I was down to $426 last Wednesday. I was fucking devastated. That was a sizable percentage of my liquid cash, and I was pissed at myself.\n\nI also felt depressed. But I told myself that I was going to day trade my way out of this. I know that I am allowed 3 day trades in a 5 trading day period. So I started day trading, and I got to almost $700 by market close Thursday. I knew the CPI print was coming out and I bet it all on SPY puts. I had a feeling that inflation would be higher than anticipated. I made a tidy profit, sold very early in the day Friday - not worrying about what I could potential miss out on (truthfully, I could have made more if I had held on for longer, but I stuck to my plan, and I was happy just to make a profit). I bought more SPY puts - and GME puts before close Friday. And I sold those early in the day today, as well. \n\nI started buying spy puts and more gme puts at various intervals today, and as of market close today, I am up to $6,062.66.\n\nMy point is, you lost very quickly, you can regain very quickly.

You can force a man to work, but you can't force a man to raise multiple children into good people at the same time, that's what we've done, and it's what doesn't work. This isn't a regional issue. It's not a cultural issue, it can happen anywhere. From \"lying flat\" or \"the last generation\" movement in china isn't far from \"antiwork\" and wanting to be childless so that you have more freedom in USA or Sweden. (I believe all these three countries have different levels of this issue, Sweden might be just be on top for now, but there is still great divide in the country, so it's not for long)\n\nYes, you can force a man to work to provide for his family, but you can't force his family to like that deal. You can force three generations to work as a slave, but the third generation will not be more loyal than the first generation ever was. In sweden, it's the second generation of immigrants that are disorderly, and I'm not even saying that they are not right to be that way, I share a lot of their values, I just have it a bit better than them. \n\nLook at slavery. One part of the reasons that slavery got abolished in USA is because the slaves actually weren't that productive, the point of slaves was to be able to point at work, and they'd do it, like animals. But when it turned out to be a full scale political dissent every day between either you and the slaves, or the slaves and the other slaves, it really wasn't that productive.\n\nThere has always been laborers that get no salary, but live on the farm and get's to eat from the food that the one that owns the farm gets to eat. Because that's a deal they are happy with. In Rome/Greece, as a slave, you were cared for. Your health was taken care of. Owning a slave was like buying a car. Are you gonna slam it into any wall just because you can, or are you going to take care of it, so that you get every little silver out of the deal? A good slave-master was way better at making sure you FELT taken care of, than we have today. It was expected of the slave-masters to make sure that the slaves were not performing horribly while working and producing goods for the farm-owner. It was in their best interest to make sure the \"slaves\" or \"drängar\" as we called them in sweden, were well fed, and well rested. Otherwise these slaves couldn't be better slaves than the neigbouring farm. You had already paid for the slave, the slave could very well drink themself to death, or take their own life, which isn't lucrative for the slave-master.\n\nMy point is that the world is our oyster, I'm not gonna let these fucking vultures that doesn't produce anything of value exist. Investors will be praised while con-men will be eaten alive, if the times are desperate. I can work for \"free\" if I get my needs taken care of.

We have all written and published on economics and technical and population adoption aspects of these topics in professional and scientific journals. \n\nTo answer your question, just from our perspective, we WANT transition to alternative power, and we know the manufacturing process for resins and silicone solar cells and the disposal processes are extremely toxic. Toxicity of silicone manufacture and disposal is why state of Colorado halted solar power rebates, due to long term negative effect on ecology of manufacture and disposal of solar cells. \n\nIt’s a difficult truth that is green washed. Sigh. \n\nYet\nWe must go forward with using what technology we have so far in alternative energy and also developing innovation technology that solves our energy demands while reducing climate effects. \n\nUnfortunately,\nNuclear is the cheapest and cleanest so far, if you get the disposal issues right. Disposal issues could be better handled. For certain. \n\nWe need transition-stage fossil fuels until we get to 100% transition. Right now the alternative energy solutions so far, other than nuclear, are more expensive per unity of energy than fossil fuels. \n\nSad but true. \nI’ve made my living in both alternative and traditional energy industries. Transition to alternative systems 40 years ago meant paying a lot of money, like almost 25% of your home value, to get a system that requires you to cut down on your electric use & give up most of your electrical appliance, and use a fossil fuel generator for backup. Most people won’t make the sacrifice of not using a blow dryer or blender, or not turning on your printer unless you go turn on your generator for a few minutes. Most people don’t want to personally maintain the battery system. \n\nIf you want a utility to do all that for you, it still costs a lot more than what you pay now for electricity. \nAnd the infrastructure cannot be built faster than 5-10-20 years, depending on the geographic region and what’s already in place. \n\nPeople do not want to be inconvenienced to reduce demand in order to go 100% alternative, nor do people want to pay double or triple to put in 100% alternative energy, and right now we still need to build more batteries to store wind and solar power when the sun is not shining and the wind is not blowing. \n\nYes, Facebook can SAY legally that they’re 100% alternative but only because they can afford millions to put in solar farms and use the electric utility as a backup and buy RECs (alternative energy credits) to offset (on paper) the fossil fuel use they get from the backup utility. Those RECs come from somewhere else where somebody sold their alternative energy credits to Facebook. It’s all in paper. It’s legal. But it’s not what you’d really say is 100% alternative when you know the details: they’re still using fossil fuel backups. \n\n1970s recession recovery was based on fossil fuels leveraging our way out financially via global markets. It’s not the same situation right now. We decided then, Nixon championed it, for US to become energy independent via fossil fuel production. We are there now. But we export so much fossil fuel that our own prices must go up higher. \n\nWe export fuel so that makes less fuel for our domestic use, which causes inflation. \nSame with wheat. Food costs more in US because we export so much food. \nStudy the economics of GDP on investopedia.com and you will understand why US exports so much food and fuel. \n\nThe war on fossil fuels inhibits our inflation recovery, due to disincentive domestic fuel exploration and production. We don’t have the infrastructure to increase production because due to ESG our domestic investment in production was reduced. Old production phased out, was Not replaced. You can’t build infrastructure overnight. Fracking takes 8-12 months from start of well exploration to refinery output. New Gulf Oil wells take 2-5 years. \n\nWe used to have more fossil fuel production and refinery capacity, but it has dwindled due to war on fossil fuels. Now we are exporting fuels that if we didn’t export, we would not suffer so much from inflation. \n Sorry to be so long-winded. \nIt’s a simple idea, easy to say “we should just go 100% alternative, what’s the problem?” It’s not so easy to actually do it. If you’ve ever been the person ordering parts and equipment, assembling nuts and bolts and wiring it up on site, using and maintaining alternative systems on a small scale for a single home or cluster of homes, and on a utility scale, you’ll agree with me. \n\nIt’s the nuts and bolts of actually succeeding at getting the job done where we need to put our efforts.

So it’s the retail (gasoline & diesel)  spending and spending on industrial products that drives fossil fuel demand to a greater extent than industrial demand by itself. \n\nSince supply is capped for the near future, the most volatile variable in the supply/demand equation is the uncertainty of demand. \n\nChina’s demand (both consumer and industrial) is a major influence on market expectations for demand-side pricing of fossil fuels. \nHow soon China gets past the recurring Covid shutdowns is uncertain, but their Political Will to get past the Covid shutdowns is certain, because China is worried and driven by US and EU growing investments in re-shoring chip manufacturing.\n\nSee news on Global Foundries, Intel, Amazon, Google, US & French governments talks in the last ten days regarding funding & starting construction on new chip manufacturing plants in US and EU.\n\nAll these supply and demand influences, the uncertainties, are anchored in uncertainties connected with unfriendly governments. China snd Russia have been planning their takeover of global financial and commodities markets for over two years. Chine started buying and stockpiling extra oil in 2020. \n\nBy the way, the China oil refineries ETF is seeing increased profit performance lately, which indicates that money is flowing into speculation on China’s role in providing refined fossil fuels to itself and the Asian markets. What’s interesting here is that China needs to build or buy more oil freighter to import crude and export refined liquid petrochemicals. Is China buying freighters-being-built in Greek shipyards? Greece and Malta are currently enjoying a booming freighter transport business. Their ships are very involved in Russian oil ship-to-ship transfers and oil freighter transport. \n\nWhen Lloyds of London stops insuring oil freighters carrying Russian oil in September, who will underwrite those freighters at higher insurance fees? China? \nChina does have an excess of capital and has been investing heavily in Blackrock, eschewing US Treasuries, afraid of confiscation if the go ahead snd invade Taiwan, as they’d planned to do in the big Russian-Sino plan to expand borders and grab resources. \n\nBlackrock, (influenced by its Chinese investors?), is also “light on US Treasuries.” See Bloomberg’s interview a couple weeks ago with Larry Fink. \n\nForeign investment in US Treasuries is down. Which is one reason why Treasury prices are down and yield are up. A reason not too much in the news. \n\nAnother uncertainty: we are approaching hurricane season.

The CDO's were only ONE of the hollow sources of collateral used to cover margin for overleveraged high risk bets by institutions (banks and hedge funds primarily).

Almost all major banks are overleveraged by over 100:1 on the derivatives market alone! And then what happens? Covid. Businesses going under, people losing homes, debt defaults, it all removes liquidity from their books. China's Evergrande is being delisted Thursday, defaulting hundreds of billions of dollars in foreign bonds. And there's more coming. \n\nThe overnight drops like Facebook and Netflix, trillions disappearing from crypto instantly... these aren't reactions to normal speculation, they're desperate moves for liquidity.

Settles $24.6 Million Consumer Lawsuit Over Slowing Down Performance on Older iPhones**\r  \n*November 18, 2020*\r  \nSan Diego County District Attorney Summer Stephan announced today that Apple Inc. will pay $24.6 million to settle a California lawsuit alleging the company failed to disclose that iPhone software it instructed consumers to download intentionally slowed down the performance in older iPhones. In a separate action, **the tech company is simultaneously settling a nationwide lawsuit for $113 million under the same basis.**\r  \nThe Cupertino, CA-based company reached a settlement with the San Diego County District Attorney’s Office, as well as the California Attorney General’s Office, Alameda, Los Angeles, Santa Clara and Santa Cruz County District Attorney’s offices. Apple Inc. will pay $4.1 million in fines to each agency.\r  \n\\*\\*\\*\r  \n**Ongoing Labor Abuses in China**\r  \nWhile Apple might have joined the Fair Labor Association in 2012 and may have carried out audits at some Foxconn facilities, the horrific labor abuses that plague Apple’s Chinese supply chain continue unabated. Systemic labor violations at eleven Chinese Apple suppliers have not stopped.\r  \nReports detail similar problems across suppliers, including very low pay, excessive and forced overtime, up to 14-hour shifts and 100-hour work weeks, standing for 11 hours at a time, increased use of temporary laborers, employment of underage and forced student workers, a military-style of management with prohibitions on bathroom breaks and inadequate lunch breaks, and unsafe work environments.\r  \nThrough undercover investigations, researchers found consistent problems with factories in Apple’s Chinese supply chain. They also found 10,000 underage and student workers out of 70,000 employees across three sites. These underage workers are not given the protections for minor workers required by Chinese labor law, are paid far less than the average worker, and are forced to work by their schools, and forced to pay fees to the school.\r  \nSome workers were poisoned due to high levels of acetone vapor in the factory, and some suffered eye injuries due to lack of safety googles. According to the US Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, when not handled properly in unventilated environments acetone can be highly dangerous, causing irritation of the nose, throat, lungs, and eyes, as well as headaches, light-headedness, confusion, increased heart rate, nausea and vomiting, and even fainting and coma. Workers also suffered serious bodily injuries. In response to the report Apple thanked the researchers for investigating its Chinese suppliers but did not acknowledge responsibility or take any action.\r  \n\\*\\*\\*\r  \n**Other Apple Crimes**\r  \nApple’s unethical shortcomings include allegations of unethical business practices such as anti-competitive behavior, punitive litigation against competitors and customers, dubious Tax Dodging, the use of sweatshop labor, misleading warranties and, and concerns about environmental destruction from mining for its supply chain - Tin is mined for Apple products. Additionally, it has been criticized for its collaboration with U.S. surveillance program PRISM.", "score": -2, "replies": [{"body": "Ok?

Apple just gets a pass on all of its BS, huh?\n\n**The Dark Side of that New Shiny Apple Product**\n\nI bet you love your Airpods, can’t spend your day without your Mac, iPhone is your best friend, and Apple watch accompanies you in all the adventures of your life. The way they all work seamlessly is just better than the cherry on top of any cake.\n\nThis ecosystem that Apple has created, and the self-serving rules they have set for the tech industry, have allowed Apple to set itself up a tech tsar, and demand that other tech companies pay the ‘Apple tax’. Apple releases a new smartphone, everyone has to buy it, even though their current smartphone is less than 2 years old. Apple released Airpods, and it’s like the world has never seen Bluetooth earphones before. Apple has the worst Mac repair service, but no-one seems to care. We still want the “sexiest” new Apple laptop. They have a 64% margin on iPhone X, but no one seems to care about the ridiculous $999 price.\n\nBut this goes way far than just the hardware. Apple gets to control the App Store market in the whole IOS platform, they receive 30% of every single payment you make from the apps downloaded from the App Store. They get to make rules which other companies must follow, big or small, it does not matter. Apple recently became the first American 2 trillion-dollar company. Where do you think all this money comes from?\n\n**Our Platform Our Rules**\n\nApple gets a 30% fee for all the purchases made from the apps downloaded from the App store. But is this justified, or is it highway robbery? However, when you download Amazon Prime from the App Store, you can pay directly to Amazon for subscription, and Apple does not get that 30% fee. The App Store does the same thing for Amazon’s Kindle app. But, other apps such as Spotify charges you $3 extra to cover the ‘Apple tax’. Apple made $15 billion just from this ‘Apple tax’ in 2019. But Apple is not allowing everyone to do that, probably because they don’t want to mess with giants like Amazon. Recently, Epic Games, the company that owns Fortnite, tried to do the same thing. They added a payment gateway to allow Fortnite players to directly pay to Epic bypassing ‘Apple tax’. Apple removed Fortnite from the App Store and threaten Epic to remove the payment gateway. Epic sued Apple for its monopoly over the IOS App Store, and over the fact that they bend rules for different companies, showing the amount of monopoly power and taxation authority Apple has over the tech industry.\n\n**Apple’s Hardware Henchman: Foxconn**\n\nFoxconn is the controversial Chinese electronics manufacturer that Apple uses to produce its parts. It is the largest electronics company in the world. But, Foxconn’s shameless use of sweatshop factories should concern Apple product users. Foxconn’s work place practices have been a concern from the beginning. In 2010, Foxconn assembly-line workers began killing themselves. Worker after worker threw themselves off the towering dorm buildings, sometimes in broad daylight, in tragic displays of desperation – and in protest at the work conditions inside. There were 14 (including 5 teenagers) confirmed deaths by suicide, and an additional 18 reported suicide attempts that year alone. Apple carried out an investigation themselves into working conditions at Foxconn factories and found that they were using underage workers which they referred to as ‘student interns’. Yet, Apple continues to work with Foxconn. However, Apple’s pristine image has not been sullied, and has suffered no repercussion or guilt by association.\n\n**Apple Becomes Part Of The NSA’s Prism Project**\n\nPeople didn’t like the idea that Apple was involved in NSA’s Prism Project. However, Apple was very vague when they were questioned by journalists about their involvement in this covert surveillance program. And Apple’s clear evasiveness is what a lot of people were not happy with, especially since they had previously denied being connected with the NSA project at all.

There's a couple of different purposes crypto could fill:\n\n**Store of value**\n\nObviously talking about BTC here. A big issue in the world is that 90%+ of people don't have a way to store their wealth.  Real inflation has been 10-20% per year since 2000, so saving money is counterproductive. Until recently people couldn't even invest in the S&P easily, and even then it is at risk of market downturns.\n\nThe other alternatives (mainly real estate and gold) are inaccessible to people without considerable wealth, and cost money to hold (~3% a year for real estate to maintain its value and sub-1% for storage plus 2% inflation for gold).\n\nObviously BTC still has the same problems as the S&P and worse today, but the mistake that people make is that \"because BTC is volatile it's a bad store of value\". That's true, but nobody is buying it as a store of value today. The bet here is that it will become a store of value in 5-20 years as institutional adoption continues to increase, and if that happens it'll appreciate enormously. So essentially it's an investment today on the basis that it will become a store of value one day.\n\n**Smart contracts / block chain / Web 3.0**\n\nThis is a bit of a wide and undefined one, but cryptos like ETH allow people to build application and systems that were previously impossible. These are systems where the Blockchain, which is a neutral decentralised database that cannot be controlled by any person or entity, determines the \"truth\" of a system.\n\nWithout going into the complex details, this allows you to create smart contracts, where instead of doing work and then getting paid at the risk of someone not paying, the system determines whether the conditions were met and releases the funds after the contract was fulfilled.\n\nThis could also allow governments to let people vote digitally without a risk of fraud (no more \"stop the steal\"), allows companies to link digital and physical items with NFTs (e.g. a stolen Rolex or painting is no longer worth anything since you don't have the NFT to prove your item is real and you're the rightful owner), and many much more complex applications.\n\nThis is also what people consider web 3.0, where eventually every company will need to become a crypto company just like in the 90s/2000s every company had to become an internet/software company.\n\n**Digital currencies**\n\nThis is the last and least interesting use of cryptocurrency, and outside of stablecoins, that form a bridge between real currency and crypto, almost all of them add little to no value and/or are a complete scam.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "TY, very much- appreciate the great detail.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Bye bye crypto", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah, surely crypto is going away now despite all the institutional adoption, and it's not just another crypto winter like the last 5... :')", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Ponzi Schemes went bust?

Many believe there will be a recession, but some believe the Fed tightening will allow us to skirt a recession. The inflation is the real concern to me. Some of the most worrisome things to me are: How much will the Fed have to raise rates? Because this will impact corporations and homeowners in a huge way. That alone could bring on a recession. But they don't have a choice because of the inflation. How much will the Fed's shrinking balance sheet affect growth/economy? This is unprecedented territory. The FED does not know how shrinking their balance sheet will affect things. Are we doomed for stagflation? Japan had to stay inflation for about a decade.

We also do not differentiate based on the type of crash or fault. (For example, more than 35% of all Autopilot crashes occur when the Tesla vehicle is rear-ended by another vehicle.)

They only know if there was an accident if it gets reported to them through police/owners/insurance/etc. \n\nComparing to other automakers is going to be incredibly difficult for a number of reasons. The real question is whether Teslas gets in to more accidents, controlling for variables like type of road, time of day, etc. when driven manually or when driven on autopilot?\n\nTesla should have that information, and it shouldn't be too hard to do a statistical analysis that backs confounding factors (again, things like type of road, time of day, etc.).\n\nIf people are driving Teslas in the same ways, and when they're on autopilot they're getting in to more accidents, then Tesla needs to do something about it. But if people are using autopilot and it's safer on average than when they're driving themselves in the same kind of situation, then forcing people to use autopilot less wouldn't make any sense.", "score": 7, "replies": []}, {"body": "I highly doubt anyone who claims that has any idea what the hell they're talking about\n\nsorry, my comment is pointless and doesn't contribute value", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Lol.

But can someone with more knowledge then me check if this is actually correct?\n\n> The Fed has a dual mandate to keep unemployment low and inflation down. They do this by loosening or tightening monetary policy. A simple (crude) way to think of it is they either increase the supply of USD or they decrease it. Since the value of everything (including USD) is determined by supply and demand, this process increases or decreases the value of the dollar. When we see the market crashing, another way to think of it is the dollar is going up. When we see a high CPI print, the market reacts by assuming the Fed will tighten monetary policy more aggressively to curb inflation, and investors sell off assets to get long the dollar.\n\n> The major compounding factor is leverage. When monetary policy is loose (cheap to borrow), people take out loans to buy things. When monetary policy tightens and the market sells off, the collateral for those loans declines. This triggers margin-calls where people are forced to sell their collateral to cover their loans. The forced selling results in more margin-calls, etc. In a depression event, the leverage unwind becomes a chain-reaction where assets are continuously foreclosed on into a thin bid (not many people buying), sending the price spiraling down.\n\n> The X-factor that is under-discussed (IMO) is the U.S. national debt (I say U.S. debt b/c the USD is the global reserve currency, but the same dynamic is playing out with almost every gov in the world right now). When the market crashes, tax receipts plunge (b/c cap gains and corporate taxes make up a huge chunk of receipts). At the same time, interest rates on the massive debt are exploding The interest rate on the 10-year treasury is at the highest level since 2014 when U.S. debt to GDP was at 96% (now at ~125%).\n\n> Consequently, if the Fed keeps this up, the U.S. government will default on its debt (less revenue from taxes at the same time they're eating higher interest payments on the debt). My thesis is that, at some point (sooner than the market is currently pricing in), the Fed will be forced to follow the example of the BOJ (Bank of Japan) and implement yield curve control to prevent the U.S. government from defaulting. If/when that happens, inflation will run super hot and the market will likely explode as investors race to get out of the dollar and into hard assets.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "What he is saying is technically correct.\n\nBut the thing about finance, and monetary policy for that matter, is that there are always many many possible outcomes and they are all technically correct(usually all except when Gojo opens his mouth). \n\nBut a small change in any single factors changes the whole outcome.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "have you seen the deliveries to North Macedonia this quarter", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Ignore him.

That can be done both to the upside and the downside, but you've got to be careful where you enter and exit. Here is a strategy that's worked for me.\n\nEveryone says SQQQ and TQQQ shouldn't be held for long periods, and I agree with them, particularly when it comes to SQQQ. But over short durations it can be a profitable strategy.\n\n1) Wait for a few hard days like we've had recently. Layer into a TQQQ position. If the next day is rough again, double down. If the next day is rough too, double down again. This requires very patient and calculated buy ins as well as having a % target in mind for when to sell.\n\n2) If a market bounce occurs, SQQQ is your friend. In this macro environment bounces will be sold off as you've seen recently. Again, doubling down on the days where the market rallies is a bold strategy but it works if you are selective, aggressive, and have lots of cash to deploy. I also wouldn't do this with a large position.\n\nIn either of these scenarios I'm talking about taking maybe a $1,000 position in either TQQQ or SQQQ after a big drop or rally respectively. From there it's about being prepared to double position size several times on the giant swing days if they aren't going your way.\n\nI generally look to sell the bounces in the 10-20% profit area.\n\nIt's bold, it's risky (although not as risky as calls IMO) and for me it has worked. I'm not willing to deploy more than about $20,000 in one go with this strategy, so beginning with maybe a $1,000 position allows me to double my deployment 4 or 5 times on the crazy days.\n\nI'd be excited to hear other specific strategies to take advantage of volatility.", "score": 21, "replies": [{"body": "Interesting strategy, and I kinda see the logic here.

At what point do you cut losses if you don't see timing in your favor?\n\nAlso, what macro trends are you using to forecast your exits?

That's unrealistic. Usually I end up doubling down once or twice, and sit at a 10-15% loss before getting a few big green days. From there I exit 10-20% ahead, sometimes more and sometimes less depending on how sentiment is through those days.\n\nOn the other hand, if I hit a 20% loss and sentiment is remaining ultra bearish or if there is anything funky in the news, I'll usually bail.\n\nDue to the fact that it's such an aggressive strategy, it works out in my favor around 80-85% of the time.

Car defaults and credit card debt are ballooning. It’s safe to assume some mortgages will follow.\n\nPeople think there are all of these buyers out there just waiting for a small price decline. Those buyers existed at 2.5%, 3.5%, and maybe 4.5% mortgages. They were gone at 5.5% and absolutely don’t exist at 6.5%. Mortgage applications are at their lowest point since they started reporting (and that was before a .75% increase in a week). Most reports are that cash buyers are sitting it out waiting for price reductions. Anecdotally, my market has more new construction homes available for sale now than at any point in the last decade. 6 months ago most new construction would be sold once a basement was in the ground. Now they’re complete and not moving. The number of people who are building homes and likely can’t afford their new mortgage is probably much higher than anyone realizes.

My opinion is the Fed will take into consideration the recent market fallouts in stocks and bonds and go easy on the rate hikes this time around. They must consider the rate hikes already priced in. Also, the goal of the Fed right now is to reduce consumer spending to curb inflation—with the financial markets down 22% ytd, I think consumers are going to be very careful with spending now, and spending will self-correct. Finally, a triple rate hike tomorrow will cause panic and uncertainty, which is what the Fed has been trying to avoid ever since the pandemic. Bottom line is, essentially a 150 bps rate hike has already hit the markets. I think we’re mooning tomorrow in a sell the rumor, buy the news scenario.\n\nEdit: I was wrong. Fed did a triple hike.
