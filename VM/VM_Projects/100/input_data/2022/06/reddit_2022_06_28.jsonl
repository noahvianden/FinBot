I’ve been around for 45 years.”\n\nThe innovation-focused investor said inflation has turned out to be hotter than she had expected due to supply chain disruptions and geopolitical risks.\n\n“We were wrong on one thing and that was inflation being as sustained as it has been,” Wood said. “Supply chain ... Can’t believe it’s taking more than two years and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine of course we couldn’t have seen that. Inflation has been a bigger problem but it has set us up for deflation.”\n\nInflation measured by the consumer price index rose 8.6% in May from a year ago, the fastest increase since December 1981.\n\nWood said consumers are feeling the rapid price increases, reflected in sentiment data that’s fallen to record lows. She pointed to the University of Michigan’s Surveys of Consumers, which showed a reading of 50 in June, the lowest level ever.\n\nThe popular investor has had a tough 2022 as her disruptive technology darlings have been among the biggest losers this year in the face of rising interest rates. Her flagship active fund Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK) is down a whopping 52% year to date, falling 66% from its record high set in February 2021.\n\nStill, Wood said her clients are mostly sticking with her and new money is coming in as investors seek diversification in a down market. ARKK has had more than $180 million in inflows in June, according to FactSet.\n\n“I think the inflows are happening because our clients have been diversifying away from broad-based bench marks like the Nasdaq 100,” Wood said. “We are dedicated completely to disruptive innovation.

What is an expansion?**\n\n>A: The NBER's traditional definition of a recession is that it is a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and that lasts more than a few months. The committee's view is that while each of the three criteria—depth, diffusion, and duration—needs to be met individually to some degree, extreme conditions revealed by one criterion may partially offset weaker indications from another. For example, in the case of the February 2020 peak in economic activity, we concluded that the drop in activity had been so great and so widely diffused throughout the economy that the downturn should be classified as a recession even if it proved to be quite brief. The committee subsequently determined that the trough occurred two months after the peak, in April 2020. An expansion is a period when the economy is not in a recession. Expansion is the normal state of the economy; most recessions are brief. However, the time that it takes for the economy to return to its previous peak level of activity may be quite extended.\n\n>**Q: The financial press often states the definition of a recession as two consecutive quarters of decline in real GDP. How does that relate to the NBER's recession dates?**\n\n>A: Most of the recessions identified by our procedures do consist of two or more consecutive quarters of declining real GDP, but not all of them. In 2001, for example, the recession did not include two consecutive quarters of decline in real GDP. In the recession from the peak in December 2007 to the trough in June 2009, real GDP declined in the first, third, and fourth quarters of 2008 and in the first and second quarters of 2009. Real GDI declined for the final three quarters of 2001 and for five of the six quarters in the 2007–2009 recession.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "The data looks back in time to determine if we are in a recession, but that means that once it confirms we're in a recession we would have been in one during the time the data was populating.

If the stock is 80% down from its previous high when I buy it, and later it is 90% down from that same previous high, then I have lost 50% of my money, not 10%. You **do** realise that, right? For me as an investor, the difference between the top and 50% down is just as big as the difference between 80% down and 90% down. **That** is *simple math*.   \nAlso, your second argument is completely irrelevant: okay, other sectors could start crashing harder than they have so far, but that does not in any way prevent high growth stocks from continuing to crash.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Yes you're right, \"simple math\" wasn't the right way to explain it. Obviously a stock that has dropped 80% could still drop another 50% from there. Every stock could theoretically go to zero.\n\nBut the point I made about the limited risk at these levels still holds because of the supply/demand dynamics that drive stock prices. Once a stock has dropped 70 or 80%, there is very little selling pressure left in the stock. Most investors who wanted out already got out. If you bought a stock at $100 and held it down to $20, you're not going to suddenly sell if it drops to $15 or $10. At these levels most people left holding the stock are planning to hold for a rebound, possibly add, and other investors are looking to get in.\n\nAnd my other point is certainly not irrelevant. That's how stock indices work. They are reflections of the prices of the stocks within those indices. While high growth stocks could drop more from where they are, they don't make up enough of the indices to cause another 20-30% drop in the \"broader markets.\" The only way the indices drop that much from here is if investors flee the \"safe\" stocks that have held up and drive those prices down another 20-30%.

Putin realizes that his grand plan to rebuild the USSR is impossible.  he is also aware that very few people support the war anymore, if they ever did.   \n\nBy September, or even earlier, Putin begins to realize that it is not worth it.  He finally realizes he has made a terrible error.  He may have realized this already.  Or maybe he has a health relapse. He feels weak, trapped, and searches for an exit ramp that won't cost him his life or power.  In order to save face, Putin okays backchannel negotiations with an intermediary, trying to win some territory and concessions. A deal is made in exchange for partial gradual lifting of sanctions.  All wrapped up by the end of september.\n\nIn October gas and oil prices plummet. Inflation goes away.

According to UK military experts, and the UK always has the best intel on Russia,  Putin's over-estimated military is nearly depleted now already, they are pulling in old fat guys to replace dead officers and using green conscripts and hired thugs to replace troops.  They have also lost about 40% of their armored vehicles, expended most of their missiles, a big chunk of their air force and several major naval vessels including their biggest one. Plus there is growing resistance from the public to support the war in any way.\n\nRemember also that the sanctions severely restrict Russia's ability to repair and replace sophisticated equipment and components.  Meanwhile Ukraine is freshly supplied with weaponry that is superior to Russia's. According to General Petraeus Ukraine just received over 260,000 artiller rounds, some 20, 000 miles, all kinds of killer drones, air defense systems and anti ship missiles capable of sinking Russia's Navy.   Putin is afraid to bring out his Navy but he needs to try.  Ukraine will be ready.   Likely the US and NATO are also giving Ukraine excellent intelligence including real time targeting intel. \n\nSo yes, if Putin is insane and wants Ukraine at any cost he could maybe keep this thing going for a year, but winter is coming soon, the Russian economy is collapsed, and Putin's oil=-gas money is about to be cut in half.\n\nWhat Xi in China is thinking is anyone's guess but it largely has to do with if he wants to end up like Putin. Any invasion of Taiwan would be both very costly for China as Taiwan is extremely well armed, but would also result in Putin like sanctions.  And yes China is taking advantage of the situation to get discounted oil and other experts from Russia but it is not enough to sustain Putin and the tremendous costs of his war.   \n\nSo sounds like you root for Putin.

The business doesnt matter at all when there is a major market crash.\n\nCase and point.\n\nDuring the financial crisis, residential REITs were near 100% safe and anyone with knowledge of real estate could have told you that. The reason is when there is a recession, housing sales and startups fall and demand for rentals goes up. Add to that, people losing their homes due to the crisis and bam, residential REITs had a field day. Though its true they had less access to financing, interest rates were falling (also a plus) and given how far property value fell, they could just buy things with cash anyway.\n\nSo yea, you would think that people with a brain would have piled into those REITs... but nope. None of the fundamentals mattered. Stocks like AIV went from around $40 to about $7 even though their dividends were 100% solid and both rent and interest changes were positive for them. The yield on their common share was stupid... like 15% (lol). Oh and thats just the tip of it. Their bonds and fixed income issues of some REITs.... wow. Those were even safer than the common shares and they all dropped from $25 to about $10 for residential stuff. The yield on those was like 20%. I was buying fixed income for even less than that during the major dip. I had stuff paying 40%-50% yield on basis (bought them fro like $3-$5 on $25 issue price) and they were near 100% safe because their business operations were not in peril.\n\nSo in other words, when a major crash happens, your share price and business performance dont matter nor does your current valuation. None of it matters. This is probably because of funds. People pulling their money from funds causes them to sell stuff systematically, not selectively. This takes everything down. This is probably even more acute for bond funds since those are so low volume thus their prices drop a ton when they are forced to sell.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Stocks have not, and will not hit their bottom until the Fed starts alluding to lowering rates and performing quantitative easing, both of which are inflationary tools for economic growth \n\nLearn about inflation and what tools the Federal Reserve needs to bring it down.

GM produced a part for 13 years where the pin in an ignition lock was shorter than designed and tested, the ignition would cut out on a bumpy road and power steering and brakes would lose power, and the airbag would be disabled. 26 people lost their lives because the silo culture at GM prevented them from fixing the problem and recalling a $0.30 part.\n\n**Nissan/Renault**’s CEO literally embezzled money then escaped from house arrest before trial and is on the lam hiding from Japanese authorities in Lebanon.\n\n**VW** the company was literally started by Hitler.

As a business owner it's your job to provide a service to society. \"good\" wages are nice but they're relative and based on supply/demand. Remember, providing entry level jobs matters too. Your business doesn't deserve to die just because you're not paying significantly more than the competition....\n2. Restaurant industry is very difficult and the more extensive your menu the more risk you take on. Still, I disagree with \"restaurants are too cheap\". In fact, I think the restaurant industry is an EXCELLENT representation of capitalism and competition at work. The potential is there and greatness is rewarded. Nothing is ever \"too cheap\" in capitalism; standard supply/demand.\n3. Capitalism. Be different, excel, charge more. If competition can lower prices and kill your margins then look inward rather than blaming the competition and/or the industry as a whole.\n4. Chefs have a very low starting wage I'll agree but it's a \"passion\" profession with a very low cost to entry. You don't need a degree, debt, or extensive experience to start.\n5. Supply and demand. That you can even choose good wages over low prices and survive means you're doing something right.\n6. This is true in every industry! In my world, if corporate gave 2 shits about what doctors had to say then our healthcare system would be WAY better.\n7. This is a super important point in most businesses. You HAVE to understand your customer. In your case, they want and EXPECT a pleasant and delicious experience. Nobody cares how much it costs you or how hard your job is. You have to do value analysis. If Tesla takes -10% production loss just to cut panel gaps that few will notice then it's NOT worth it.\n8. THE ONLY credit/criticism is your revenue. Your net might drop (within reason of course) if you're paying better but if revenue is up then your prices make sense.\n9. Ahhhh yelp. Fucking yelp. I have had extensive arguments about yelp and always come to the same conclusion... The rating system should just be upvote / downvote %.

I’ve been around for 45 years.”\n\nThe innovation-focused investor said inflation has turned out to be hotter than she had expected due to supply chain disruptions and geopolitical risks.\n\n“We were wrong on one thing and that was inflation being as sustained as it has been,” Wood said. “Supply chain ... Can’t believe it’s taking more than two years and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine of course we couldn’t have seen that. Inflation has been a bigger problem but it has set us up for deflation.”\n\nInflation measured by the consumer price index rose 8.6% in May from a year ago, the fastest increase since December 1981.\n\nWood said consumers are feeling the rapid price increases, reflected in sentiment data that’s fallen to record lows. She pointed to the University of Michigan’s Surveys of Consumers, which showed a reading of 50 in June, the lowest level ever.\n\nThe popular investor has had a tough 2022 as her disruptive technology darlings have been among the biggest losers this year in the face of rising interest rates. Her flagship active fund Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK) is down a whopping 52% year to date, falling 66% from its 52-week high.\n\nStill, Wood said her clients are mostly sticking with her and new money is coming in as investors seek diversification in a down market. ARKK has had more than $180 million in inflows in June, according to FactSet.\n\n“I think the inflows are happening because our clients have been diversifying away from broad-based bench marks like the Nasdaq 100,” Wood said. “We are dedicated completely to disruptive innovation. Innovation solves problems.”", "id": "vmocyd", "created_utc": 1656425922.0, "score": 288, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 188, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|12|**First Seen In WSB**|1 month ago\n**Total Comments**|66|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|2 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=vmocyd)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=vmocyd)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you for posting the source", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "She picks Roku , tdoc as top stock ahead of Meta, amzn, nvda and terms it innovative etf 😀", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Recession is cancelled bois", "score": 247, "replies": [{"body": "What if Cramer says we’ve hit the bottom?", "score": 29, "replies": [{"body": "Then looks like Recession is back on the menu bois", "score": 48, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Market will be strictly sideways until puts expire, then immediate plummet.", "score": 22, "replies": [{"body": "That sounds about right", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Lol", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "Her space ETF invests in farm tractors.
