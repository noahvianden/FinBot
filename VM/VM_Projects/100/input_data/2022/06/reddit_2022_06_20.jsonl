Anyway, I've been trying to see if there is a way to optimize the PUT strike delta, DTE, and annualized percent returns to maximize my money velocity. I noticed something, on its face, that doesn't make sense to me - **As you increase DTE, holding delta constant, your annualized percent premium return (% of notional value received as premium, annualized) goes down (see table below).**\n\nI know, roughly, Delta approximates chance of being ITM at expiration. So I would've thought that for a 30% risk of being ITM at expiration (regardless of DTE), you could expect to be equally compensated across time. Obviously, theta decay is non-linear (mostly for ATM strikes - more linear OTM) so you'd expect a much larger percent of extrinsic value to fall out in the days closest to expiration - thereby accelerating returns.\n\nI guess my question is - WHY? I haven't found a good explanation of why theta decay is non-linear. Is it because longer DTE allows for more time for underlying to bounce around, so less \"risky?\" Does that mean Delta as a prob%ITM metric is less accurate closer to expiration?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|6/24/22|||||||\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|SPY=387.31|||||||\n|PUT EXP|7/1|7/8|7/15|7/22|7/29|8/5|\n|DTE|7|14|21|28|35|42|\n|Strike|380|378|375|374|372|371|\n|Delta|\\-.294|\\-.304|\\-.295|\\-.304|\\-.3|\\-.302|\n|Gamma|.024|.018|.014|.012|.011|.01|\n|Theta|\\-.304|\\-.225|\\-.194|\\-.171|\\-.157|\\-.143|\n|Vega|.198|.274|.328|.381|.423|.463|\n|IV|24.632|24.572|25.998|26.048|26.757|26.665|\n|Premium|2.67|3.835|4.76|5.725|6.495|7.17|\n|Notional Val|38000|37800|37500|37400|37200|37100|\n|Trade Premium|267|383.5|476|572.5|649.5|717|\n|Trade%|.7%|1.01%|1.27%|1.53%|1.75%|1.93%|\n|Annualized%|36.64%|26.45%|22.06%|19.95%|18.21%|16.80%|", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "As someone who trades the wheel, I don't think it is best for \"optimized\" returns.

What in the Black-Scholes model accounts for this? Or is it that markets are fickle, and longer-term, you have a better chance of being able to recover - so the markets price this in across DTE?

I have googled and read the section on stop loss orders in the FAQ here, but I can't find the answer.\n\nImagine you have an option worth 2. You want to sell it for 6 or more if the option continues to rise. So with an increase to 6.50 and then drops to 5.50, it would be sold at 6, sticking to the limit. And if the price goes to 7.50 and then falls back to 6, then it will be sold at 6.50, following the trail. The idea behind it is that if the price reaches the limit, you have the guarantee that the reward is 3:1, while you still have the potential upward.\r  \n\r  \nA *limit order* is not a possibility, because it does not follow the rise in price above 6. If you set it to 6, the sell order will be executed when the price reaches 6. The potential upward is lost.\r  \n\r  \nA *trail order* is also not a possibility, because you cannot set it up in such a way that the sell order is executed from 6. If you set a trail of 4 so that it follows the price to 6 and follows the price from there, the trail will also follow the price down and the order will be executed for at least 2. And if you set the stop at 6, the order will probably be immediately executed after creating the order, because the current price is below the stop.\r  \n\r  \nI don't think a *trail limit order* will do either. You can set the limit to 6, but the order will not be executed if the stop is not hit.

A market order means **fill my order at any price ASAP**. Actually, it is at whatever price is the best offer on the order book at the time the order is on deck to be filled. But since the best offer can change from millisecond to millisecond, you are taking a chance that it will not be a price you will like.\n\nConsider a shallow order book that only has 10 contracts at .43 bid at the top of the book. The next order down is 1 contract for .10. Since you are only trading 1 contract you think your market order is fine, but what if an order for 10 contract slips in ahead of yours? Now the top of the book is the .10 bid and that's what your market order will fill at.\n\n>I notice on some weeks certain strike prices are completely unavailable. Does that mean that the market makers aren't liquid enough on that particular week to have that particular strike price?\n\nNo, it just means the stock price has not moved through that level since the expiration was offered. The further strikes are from ATM, the bigger gaps you will find. Near ATM are popular strikes and exchanges will add additional strikes closer together near ATM to provide more contracts in the popular zone. So the big gaps are actually the normal interval for strikes. The strikes that are closer together were added later. Usually. It doesn't always work the way I described.

Price action may have nothing to do with it. What you see in the order book is only what people have *publicly* bid in the auction (mostly market makers, but could be some organic traders). There are also bidders off stage with eyes glued to the order book looking for a price they will trade at. They enter an order *only when* a matching offer is on deck. Since this happens in milliseconds, it's usually a computer that is doing the searching and entering the orders in a flash.\n\nTechnically, the [NBBO](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nbbo.asp) would have been adjusted to meet that .50 bid, but the order would have instantly been disposed of in a fraction of a second, so you don't see the quoted bid change, it stays at .43.

The legal action is the latest in a flurry of allegations to hit the electric car maker as it navigates what could be a rough patch amid supply chain issues and other economic woes.\nFormer Tesla employees John Lynch and Daxton Hartsfield allege they were among thousands of workers fired recently amid company-wide cuts. CEO Elon Musk earlier this month emailed executives saying he had a “super bad feeling” about the economy and that Tesla would cut 10% of salaried workers, Reuters reported.\nThe lawsuit filed Sunday in federal court in Texas, where Musk’s electric car firm is headquartered after moving from Palo Alto late last year, alleges the terminations violated federal WARN Act requirements that workers receive 60 days’ written notice before being let go in a mass layoff. Also, because the workers allegedly received no such notice, they are also owed 60 days’ pay by Tesla, the suit claimed.\nThe U.S. WARN Act applies to businesses with 100 or more full-time employees or 100 or more employees who collectively work at least 4,000 hours per week excluding overtime. Like the California WARN Act, which covers businesses with 75 or more employees, it is intended to give workers advance notice that they will lose their job in a mass layoff or plant closure.\n“Tesla has not acted in good faith nor with reasonable grounds to believe their acts and omissions were not a violation of the WARN Act,” the suit alleged.\nAffected workers suffered “devastating economic impact,” the suit claimed.\nTesla did not immediately respond to questions about the lawsuit’s claims and which facilities may be seeing job losses. The company, by far the nation’s biggest electric vehicle producer, runs a large plant in Fremont that Musk said in April may be significantly expanded.\nThe legal action by Lynch and Hartsfield follows a blizzard of lawsuits in recent years over working conditions at Tesla facilities. California’s civil rights regulator is suing the company, alleging Black workers at Tesla’s Fremont factory were paid less than White workers, denied advancements and faced daily racist abuse. Tesla has called the suit the “misguided” result of a “bare bones investigation” and said the carmaker “strongly opposes all forms of discrimination and harassment.” Last week, Tesla shareholder Solomon Chau filed suit against the company, citing a dozen worker lawsuits and alleging Tesla has “a toxic workplace culture grounded in racist and sexist abuse and discrimination against its own employees,” which allegedly has exposed Tesla to hundreds of millions of dollars in potential liability for violations of state and federal law.” Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment on that lawsuit.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "after reading the first line I thought I was going to get an original content parody article from MyCatEdwin and it was going to be satirically making fun of all the fud headlines", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "https://reddit.com/r/TSLALounge/comments/vgbdip/_/id4y6v2/?context=1", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Funny, because the rounds of layoffs I've witnessed kicked everyone to the curb and cut them off immediately with no notice.

The legal action is the latest in a flurry of allegations to hit the electric car maker as it navigates what could be a rough patch amid supply chain issues and other economic woes. Lounge members u/MyCatEdwin and u/nateleb1234 say they were among thousands of loungers brought to margin call recently amid company-wide cuts. CEO Elon Musk earlier this month emailed executives saying he had a “super bad feeling” about the economy and that Tesla would cut 50% of the stock price, Reuters reported. The lawsuit filed Sunday in federal court in Texas, where Musk’s electric car firm is headquartered after moving from Palo Alto late last year, alleges the moves violated federal HORSE Act requirements that loungers receive 60 horses before being margin called. Also, because the loungers allegedly received no such horsies, they are also owed 60 days’ horse feed, the suit claimed. The U.S. HORSE Act applies to subreddits with 100 or more full-time members or 100 or more members who collectively shitpost at least 4,000 hours per week excluding whining. Like the California HORSE Act, which covers subreddits with 75 or more members, it is intended to give members advance horsies in times of economic downturns. “Tesla has not acted in good faith nor with reasonable grounds to believe their acts and omissions were not a violation of the HORSE Act,” the suit alleged. Affected members suffered “devastating economic impact,” the suit claimed. Tesla did not immediately respond to questions about the lawsuit’s claims and which subreddits may be seeing margin calls. The company, by far the nation’s biggest producer of horse-related scandals, runs a large plant in Fremont that Musk said in April may be significantly expanded.

You do not invest in growth stocks because \"NuMbAh gO uP.\" You invest in growth stocks because at some point they will generate large returns on your investment, and what you pay now is too much for what they presently produce, but it is what it will be worth later, minus a tidy risk premium that you get to collect for your trouble.\n\nBack to Tesla: even after a remarkable implosion in it's valuation, it is a $670B company that makes $5B a year.

So Tesla has cool shit, and people say \"fuck that rocks, I don't want a Benz, I want a Model 5\" and they go get one.\n\nTesla's valuation at present is SO FAR ahead of other major auto manufacturers (put together, mind) that even if they got ALL OF those people, literally 100% of them, the valuation would not be justifiable.\n\nThat's such a ludicrous proposition that it must surely command a massive risk premium, and instead that premium is apparently negative, which is fucking nuts.

I claimed that I was up around 50% in the last few weeks. u/hoopmbb6279 joked that making $0.50 on your last $1 isn't that hard. I responded that I've gone from about $26k to about $40k, and he asked me to prove it. So here we are.\n\nFirst of all, it turns out I was slightly wrong. I thought I had gone from $32k to $26k (IRA contribution) then up to $40k, which is where I got the +50% number. It turns out I went from $32k to $35k on some calls, then IRA contribution down to $29k, then up to $40k.

Lucky for me, my wife's boyfriend gave me my allowance for the year all up front so I stuck the $32k in this account.
