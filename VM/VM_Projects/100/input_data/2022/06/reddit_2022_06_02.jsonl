Rising prices are always caused by substantial increases in units of currency, the money supply.\r  \nCommodities are a very clear example. In 2022, investors have been purchasing commodity-related products to protect themselves from inflation and generate real returns. However, rising commodity prices are not a cause, they are a consequence of excessive money printing. With increased inflationary concerns, the likelihood of rising interest rates, and elevated geopolitical concerns, commodity-focused funds have seen record inflows in 2022.\r  \nThis happened at the same time as central banks injected unprecedented quantities of money into the economy. Between 2020 and 2021, the balance sheets of the major central banks rose by more than $10 trillion. Furthermore, broad money supply (M3) growth rose at an astronomical rate in 2020 and 2021 in the major economies.\r  \nOil and gas prices will be used as the scapegoat for inflation, as long central banks keep interest rates low, and continue to print massive amounts of currency. But the reality is that sharp increases in money supply actually causes commodity prices to increase, because this excessive money printing debases the currency, making it worth less.\r  \nNow the increase in broad money supply has finally translated to an explosion in all prices. Some will blame wages, others will blame the Ukraine war, and others will blame high demand due to economic recovery. The fact is that currency debasement is at the heart of generalized price rises everywhere.

With some questioning how an electric vehicle could perform in a high-speed chase, a police department may have an answer for doubters.\n\nWhat Happened: The police department in small town Logan, Ohio (population 7,150 in 2020) was involved in a high-speed pursuit with one of its two vehicles from Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA).\n\nThe Logan Police Department took delivery of two Tesla Model Y vehicles in 2021, as reported by Drive Tesla Canada. One of the two police cruisers was involved in a 30-minute high-speed chase on May 22.\n\nAs seen in the video below, the Model Y police car pulled over a Ford Mustang, a vehicle from Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F), that was caught speeding.\n\nThe passenger exited the vehicle and walked away. She is told to return to the Mustang by the police officer, but the vehicle took off when she attempted to get back in.\n\nThe Tesla Model Y cruiser chased the Mustang for 40 to 45 miles from Logan to nearby Columbus, Ohio. The chase was called off by the police officer who cited safety concerns near an expressway.\n\nThe Logan Police Department does not use pit maneuvers.\n\nThe owner of the Mustang later reported the vehicle stolen. The suspect who drove the vehicle remained at large according to the video.\n\nRelated Link: NYPD Could Purchase 250 Tesla Cars For Police Force: What Investors Should Know\n\nWhy It's Important: The Logan Police Department is one of many across the country that has added Tesla vehicles to its fleet in cost-cutting moves, such as saving the city on fuel and maintenance expenses.\n\nOne concern by some is electric vehicles wouldn't be able to keep up with vehicles in high-speed pursuits and the added issue of the electric vehicle's battery running out.\n\nThe video likely answers the first part of the concern with the Tesla Model Y keeping up with the Mustang in the pursuit. As for the second part, traditional vehicles also face the possibility of running out of gas, so it seems like a moot point.\n\nTSLA Price Action: Tesla shares are up 6.80% to $790.24 on Thursday.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Wait so this was an actual chase?

That's gonna take money out of bank reserves, which is designed to slow the expansion of lending, but the Fed's intentionally not taking all of the capital out of the system, and they're not taking it out of the market for the most part. \n\n80% of the market is institution money, and they flex leverage based on the prospects of going long. What we've seen this year is not a reduction of addressable liquidity, but rather a deleveraging due to fear and because profit calculations suggest equities may not pay as much while rates are rising. So they reduce exposure to compensate... but it's not because they don't or won't have the money, and eventually to report back to investors, they have to find that money a home.\n\nSo they short, but short positions accumulate as hedges against an underlying long position. But instead of thinking of the market as a rational actor (it isn't) what you need to do is think about it as clouds of buying and selling pressure. \n\nWhat's happened is that the market found a significant amount of buying pressure in the roughly 3900 S&P 500 range, and that built up buying power that previously existed in the 4100 range, which is what's impacting us this week. As the market goes up, short positions have to cover in order to hedge against losses in their hedges, and that amplifies the buying creating a volatile and violent bear market rally.\n\nVolume has dropped this year, but if you look at On Balance Volume charts, what you find is that we're starting to see a softening of the declining trend of volume, which indicates the market has found a short term bottom.

There isn't going to be a clear moment... and if there were, institutions would lose their shirts. \n\nOne of the functions of these rallies is to shake out puts, as the market heading in one direction becomes a cost for market makers who make money in part from dealing expiring options. If the market only heads in the trend direction, then puts become ultra-profitable and they become overweighted in the market and that results in losses for market makers who are often holding large long positions. \n\nThe market makes a lot more sense if you start thinking about it as a profit engine for institutions.
