{"title": "Investors on Reddit have a clear US bias. Here is why you should consider other markets too.", "selftext": "US total market cap as % of GDP is much higher compared to the rest of the world. This number is currently at 150% compared to 120% for Japan, 100% UK and only around 60% for Eurozone. The gap has narrowed over the last few months (US was at 200%), but remains well above historical averages. USD also appreciated by 20% against most other currencies during this period making other markets cheaper.\n\nNow there are good reasons why these markets have a lower valuation. Namely slower growth and demographics. But at the same time I think it more than compensates by being cheaper. \n\nConsider the Eurozone which is almost 3x cheaper. Structural issues, high debt, Russia conflict. But the countries are working on structural improvements and integration. With the UK gone it will be much easier. Japan has the demographics issue and high debt too. However, yen is currently at a 24 year low, there is no inflation and a massive structural opportunity for higher labour participation and foreign investment. These are areas that the government is working on.\n\nLet's go a bit further and consider some emerging markets. My two favourites are Poland and Indonesia. \n\nPoland is roughly the size of Spain in terms of population and size, and has a third of its debt. It has one of the best growth prospects in the EU. Excellent geographic location close to the centre. A bridge between east and west. Will massively benefit from the coming integration of Ukraine. However, the total market cap of all public companies there is $180bn. That is roughly the market cap of Adobe. Spain in comparison has a market cap of $800bn.\n\nIndonesia has a market cap of around $400bn which is the size of Nvidia and smaller than Tesla. This is a country with a population almost the same size as the US. Has a huge young working age population that will continue to grow over the next decade fuelling consumption. The country is growing at 5-6% a year. It is arguably becoming one of the next large, low-cost manufacturing centres with many companies abandoning China. \n\nTLDR: US is expensive and its dominance may not last forever.

I can invest in those things in the US and the market is much larger in the US. If the telecom company in NZ is really good, it's limited at having 5 million people max and that's a blip compared to the market in the US.\n\nThe other countries have other issues as well. Even a developed country like Canada is actually just a resource extraction economy--banks, oil, mining, and lumber. Australia is just mining. The US is huge and diversified--mining, manufacturing, tech, media, healthcare, pharm, etc. You know what the US makes is high value goods like jet engines, airplanes, and pharmaceuticals, not mass produced plastic trinkets.

Let’s go thru ur options: first, you could hold ur current stocks. If you do that the likelihood is that most of them will remain in business after the coming recession. It will take a while in this case, but you will most likely be able to recoup your losses within probably 5 years or so. In this case you should just ignore the account and go on with your life for a while. \n\nOption 2: you could sell all of your positions and hold the cash. In this case you will realize your losses, but you will be immune from further losses (except inflation). This is probably the least appealing option on its own.\n\nOption 3: you could sell your positions and hold the cash in the account to wait for the market to crash harder. In that case you would have time to educate yourself enough to pick better companies, which might include a few of those. You would likely get the stocks at a large discount if you time it somewhat appropriately. In this case you could end up recouping your losses and making moderate to large gains 5 years from now. \n\nLastly: you could sell those stocks and reinvest immediately into long term dividend growth stocks (preferably ones that have suffered a bit). There are plenty of them out there now. In that case your goal would not be big gains but to safely earn dividends and retain your cash. Long term it will earn you nice returns and good nights of sleep.\n\nI would make a solid recommendation between these options but I think it’s really about your life situation. If you have time to put the work in then cash that shit out and wait for killer deals. If you want safety then put that money in Chevron, Altria, ADC, and possibly AT&T. Those are of course just a few possibilities. I would lie though, this certainly isn’t a great situation and one that you should learn from. Never invest in a stock because you feel hype for it.

Prices will fall so low that many great companies will and some are already selling a value discounts. Those that buy now and hold for long will do very well. That's another thing. Every recession creates new rich people. Also, the wealthy will become wealthier because they will begin buying discounted companies and make even more wealth when the market eventually rebounds. Recessions don't last forever, and prices continue on an upward trend during economic good times, which will return some day in the future. In the mean time, people will get scared and sell. Don't fall into that trap. Hold. Your losses may be painful to look at but they aren't realized, meaning until you sell they aren't real.

The wage pressure is mostly driven by negotiating power of both the firms bidding up rates and workers having real better alternatives.  \nSo while many firms will have hiring freezes, those firms will likely suffer far more than the firms that continue to bid away the most productive workers.  \nUltimately, the rate hike will accrue top talent to the most lucrative firms and promote the failure of firms that can't source the right talent. This punishes firms with weaker cash flows disproportionately as compared with their megafirm competitors. \n\nIs big firms getting bigger the result the fed is driving for?  The best way for the labor supply to meet the demand for labor would be to make the labor market a bit more free by giving employers access to more workers.\nI realize the fed can't do this, however it's probably better for us all to pay $5 more per week in fuel costs than to see our neighbors lose their jobs permanently.
