Why would you expect the IV to be comparable? Remember, as you figured out already, **IV is sensitive to the market price**. And since price is discovered, two contracts with different rates of discovery will have differing accuracy in defining the market price, and thus IV.\n\nLet's fill in some of the blanks. All of these are SPY calls. All expirations are the monthly of the specified month/year, to keep the comparison as equal as possible.\n\n* 380 July/2022 IV 26.02%, Volume 2300, bid/ask 11.08/11.12\n* 380 June/2024 IV 23.52%, Volume 1, bid/ask 55.81/60.50\n* 450 July/2022 IV 26.94%, Volume 197, bid/ask 0.02/0.03\n* 450 June/2024 IV 20.16%, Volume 0, bid/ask 23.37/27.77\n\nBasically all of the June 2024 calls have super low volume and super wide bid/asks, so it would be expected that there would be some noise in the calculation of IV. I mean, what is the price of the 450 June/2024 call? Can you say with confidence that it is 23.37? Or is it 27.77? Or something in between? There's over $4 of difference between those prices, which means $4 of inaccuracy in calculating IV. Compared to the $.01 of difference for the July 2022 call.\n\nSo the moral of the story is, if you want to compare two IVs to confirm an expected pattern or evolution of IV, you need to have some confidence that the two market prices are comparable for accuracy.\n\nEDIT: fixed transcription error in the quotes.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "OK so what I was noticing  is just an artifact of large spread/illiquidity for further out options.\n\nThanks for mentioning the spreads its very obvious in hindsight I should have noticed that I just assumed spy options would be so liquid it wouldn't matter even that far out but that was very incorrect.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "> OK so what I was noticing  is just an artifact of large spread/illiquidity for further out options.\n\nIn my opinion, yes.

If you sold a naked put, why would you sell another naked put \"to protect it\"?\n\n\"Naked\" refers only to contracts you have sold to open that are not secured by underlying shares. If all you did was buy to open a put, it is not considered naked. It's just a long put.\n\nAssuming you have a long put and assuming it has reached some level of profit you want to protect, you can write a put with a lower strike price to build a floor under your loss.\n\nExample: Say your LLY 340p 10/21 cost you $4.00. It is now worth $5.00 for a 25% gain. You want to protect that gain while continuing to be exposed to potential upside. You can look for a lower strike that is OTM from the current price that pays a $4 credit. Let's say that is the 320p 10/21 (same expiry). You leg into a a 340/320p 10/21 and your net cost basis is $0.00 ($4 for the original long put and -$4 credit for the short put) and the net value of the new spread is $1.00. If you closed it immediately, you'd keep your $1.00 gain. If LLY continues to go down, the long leg will gain more than the short leg, so you'll continue to gain, though at a slower pace since your net delta is now lower. If LLY moves against you, holding the spread close to expiration will net out any loss to very close to $0.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Sorry for the incorrect vocab.

However, suppose XYZ goes to $101 and now suddenly, in a split second, the call is worth $100. If XYZ bounces between $99.99 and $101 throughout the day, the call is going to whiplash between totally worthless at $0 to $100 in value. That's gamma.\n\nBut now consider the same situation, XYZ at $99.99 and a $100 call, but it is 10 DTE. There is still some hope the call will make a profit, so it won't be worthless. It might be worth $69.

At 0 DTE the call had $0 value at the $100 strike (when the stock price was $99.99), but at 10 DTE the $0 value strike might be quite a bit higher, like $109 or something like that.

While the manufacturer faces a tough quarter, the firm sees plenty of reason to be optimistic about its stock.\n\nCredit Suisse's Dan Levy expects Tesla to announce Q2 deliveries of 242,000 vehicles, below the consensus estimate of around 273,000. Regardless, the bullish outlook for TSLA is “is amplified” given the company's strong positioning, he wrote. The analyst is confident that Tesla remains the world leader in electric vehicles, and with the deterioration of the global situation with the supply chain, its leadership will only increase.\n\n“We believe the long-term case for Tesla is clear–Tesla remains the global leader in EVs, and amid rising supply chain risks, we believe Tesla's lead over other automakers in the race to EV is only amplified given its lead in vertical integration and its prior EV experience,” Levy wrote.\n\nAlthough Levy cut Tesla's share price target to $1,000 from $1,125, he looked beyond this quarter alone and kept the outperform rating on the shares that he established back in January. Although Giga Shanghai is underperforming in Q2, the analyst expects a sharp rise in the second half of the year. Despite all the headwinds, which are short-term, the long-term positive outlook on Tesla is provided by fundamental indicators.\n\n“[We]continue to believe in our thesis that robust fundamentals ahead should outweigh the near-term challenges for Tesla such as the recent growth selloff, production disruptions in China, lingering semiconductor failure and magnified inflationary pressures,” Levy wrote.\n\nhttps://www.tesmanian.com/blogs/tesmanian-blog/teslas-lead-over-other-automakers-in-ev-racing-only-gets-stronger-due-to-headwinds-says-credi", "id": "vlqpvi", "created_utc": 1656318855.0, "score": 140, "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "num_comments": 295, "comments": [{"body": "no shit. a company thats trading 20-30 times what VW trades better has unlimited growth for the next 10 years", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "Tesla’s business model is vastly different than VW’s.

That helps Bolsonaro right before a key election. he quips that he'd vote for desantis and would let Trump back on Twitter, and the SEC is about to bust the fraudulent scam Truth Social so trump desperately needs to spread his nefarious lies on Twitter.

First circa 2015, Michael Cohen reports Trump just heard some mysterious Russian overpaid for a ramshackle Florida mansion he had for sale by a whopping 50 million.  That is the Russia paid 50 million above asking.  Trump winked to Cohen and said \"that was Putin\", and trump was very proud of getting that bribe. A 50 million bribe is more than enough to buy Trump especially back then and you know it.\n\nI advise you also study the strict barriers and rules Mueller had to contend with in his severely limited investigation where he convicted 44 Russians and Trump 2016 top officials.  1) He wasnt allowed to indict Trump even thoug he caught tyrump with Stone lying ab out talking to Wikileaks   2) He could not look at the Trump Org and their financing and Russian money laundering which Steve Bannon said in 2017 was what would land Trump in prison.   3) He could not follow Russian money back prior to 2016    3) He could not investigate anything not directly linked to the 2016 campaign   4) He had to close and end the investigation with \"only\" 44 convictions before the midterm season began.\n\nPutin also openly admitted yes of course he intervened in the 2016 election to help Trump. In Helsinki, google it.  It was no secret. Mueller and others detailed the 10 million Russian trolls they created to act as disinformation agents from 2016 to the present day.  If you had ten million fans on the internet lying for you don't you think you could make headway in whatever it was you were trying to do?  Mueller also confirmed Putin gtried to hack every single election in 2016 and only succeededonce, in Florida, which was never fixed because Rick scott didn't want it fixed. and that is how we got Desantis. desantis's righthand aide was just ougted as a Russian-georgian agent by the DOJ. Sgtay tuned on that one.\n\nRead the Steele Dossier. It is almost all proven facts. It is exactly how it went down. See Jill Stein and Michael Flynn celebrating with Putin in Moscow right after the election, Both were Russian agents along with Tulsi Gabbard.  Stein alone made the difference in the election when trump had no Green fake Russian candidate in 2020 he tried to make one up with Kanye West. Putin also ran twpo candidates in 2016, Rand Paul as well who McCain twice called a Russian agent.\n\nRead the Trump Tower meeting transcripts.

Ron Paul tried getting proof that there is actually gold in Fort Knox, and even as a high level elected official he was completely unable to get cold hard proof.

Either way, the reality is that there is way more paper than there is actual bullion, and there is a belief that someday this may all coming to a reckoning.\n\nAs the theory goes: when a crisis emerges that prompts firms and central banks to want to collect physical delivery and we only have enough physical bullion to fulfill 1/10th of the existing delivery contracts, and everyone is owed gold and silver that cannot be provided... they may go absolutely vertical.\n\nThe effect would be similar to a short squeeze.\n\nI would also mention that we have already seen paper trading cause natural resource commodity prices to have insane price behaviours when market conditions have pushed things to a boiling point. One example is when all those oil traders had too many damn oil futures and oil went to like -$45 because people were paying to get rid of contracts they couldn't receive shipment for.
