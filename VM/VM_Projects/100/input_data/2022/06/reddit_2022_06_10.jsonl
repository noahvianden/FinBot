Tesla is a money-making machine that is/will generate plenty of cash to sustain its growth till the end of the decade, while the other automakers will need external capital, that in a high-interest rate environment will demand that they are more profitable than Tesla. Hard to imagine how they'd accomplish that.\n\nPut all of that together and Tesla has a clear advantage in cars at least till the end of the decade.  The change to electric is basically a reset on a 100+ year old business model, so don't look at the past for guidance.\n\nAnd by the time automakers are (optimistically) catching up to Tesla in 2030, electric cars will be just a low-margin commodity and a platform. Tesla will already have developed other strong revenue streams that are beyond the reach of existing automakers, such as FSD (that most automakers won't be able to develop in-house and will outsource), and maybe even an intelligent robot that will chauffer other makers' cars for you.

Couple large property tax increases in many places on top of that). \n\nIn 2008 it was people who shouldn't have bought a home buying them.  Now we have couples raking in $200K at the peak of their careers taking out 30 year mortgages with $4000 - $5000 monthly payments paying an inordinate amount of their takehome just on housing.  Their economic situation can only get worse since they are already high earners.  Also, we used to say, inflation makes your payment seem small after a few years.  Well, that works when your payment is $2000.  But when it's $4500, it's gonna take 20 years of inflation to make that payment seem small", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "2008 happened for a lot of reasons.

They have finished a phase III study for a vaccine against the Chikungunya virus, where their vaccine showed 96% efficacy after 180 days. Should the rest work smoothly, they will have a monopoly on that vaccine, no others exist. The market for Chikungunya vaccines is estimated to be roughly half a billion $ annually for the next 10 years at least, although climate change might see the demand rise. As of now, Chikungunya is relevant in South America (more than 90k cases in Brazil this year alone), subsaharan Africa to South Africa, India, parts of China, and Southeast Asia.

An index fund is just an asset tracking an index, and it can either be in the form of a mutual fund or ETF. Mutual funds only process at the end of the day, unlike ETFs. You pick a dollar amount, and using the closing prices for that day, an exact decimal number of shares are bought to match your requested dollar amount. So if you bought say VTSAX, a mutual fund, at 2PM EST, it will buy at 4PM EST prices, and typically you won't see an 'executed' indication until later (for Vanguard, next morning). If you place the order at 4:05 PM EST, for instance, it will not execute until the *end* of the next trading day, so in today's case, not until Monday at 4PM. If you order 100 dollars of VTSAX and the index fund is trading at 75 dollars a share at 4PM EST today, then 100/75 = 1.333 shares will be bought at 75 dollars a share at 4PM EST.\n\nAn ETF, on the other hand, such as VTI, executes at the moment you buy it at the current price, assuming you did so during the trading day. If you place the order after 4PM, it will typically execute as soon as the next trading day starts at 9:30 AM EST. (In this case, Monday at 9:30 AM EST.) Unlike mutual funds, you buy integer counts of shares, not just place dollar amounts. So you might buy 2 shares of VTI at $69.42 price at 3:45 PM EST, and that's exactly what you get. However, brokerages nowadays offer fractional shares, so if you want to buy exactly $200 dollars of an ETF priced at $69 per share, you can actually buy 200/69 shares exactly. This is a relatively recent feature.\n\nTo add to others' responses, you can modify your ETF order to use 'stop losses' or 'limit order' which just means the brokerage will wait until some target price is achieved. You can do this with stocks in general. People do this so you don't have to track the market until VTI hits say $68 dollars from its current price of say $69: the brokerage will do it when the price is right.\n\nEven if the transactions are executed immediately or at 4PM EST, financial institutions go through many of the data processing overnight or in the next few days. So you may not even see your 'settlement account' updating for a few days. But you can be assured that all the orders you placed are being executed in a timely manner, and the balance/settlement-account/funds-available-to-trade quantities are accounting technicalities you don't need to worry about for the most part.

You don't know when exactly the recession will hit, you don't know when the market will be at it's lowest. Generally speaking, you don't really wanna overextend too early, although chances are it will still work out if you can stomach it. Likewise, you probably don't just wanna hold onto all of your money waiting for prices to go deeper and deeper until the point where, well, they rise again and keep rising.\n\nWhich leads me to my next point: Being able to stomach what happens. Think about your goals as well as your risk tolerance and act accordingly.

While there may be chances in there, the risk is even higher than usual, and I believe those companies should be treated accordingly unless you know something almost no one else knows.

Remember that everyone else is in this mf boat and I am not alone. Everyone is feeling the pinch (except for the couple of guys who “saw it coming” and cashed out/went short). \n\n3. End most/all automatic recurring investment (except for paycheck 401k contributions) and build up as much cash as possible. \n\n4. Deploy the cash when close to bottom (for me that means at the very least that unemployment needs to shoot up to 7%+, the market needs to fall around 40-50% from ATH, and the Fed needs to go back to being dovish eg lowering rates). So with inflation the way it is, that *could* be literally years out before all that happens. Time will tell.\n\n5. Watch Stranger Things before I cancel Netflix (sorry NFLX bag-holders) - seriously, there’s a lot more to life than stocks. You can enjoy life while your stocks plummet.

Only time recession really blows is if you have to sell stocks (low!) to pay the bills. Otherwise, you build up cash and either buy a house on sale, buy stock on sale, or earn decent $ on a high yield savings account/money market fund (especially if interest rates get to double digits).\n\nIt’s funny how many people here are worried about double digit interest rates. All my debt is locked in at 3.25% or less, and if I could earn 10-15% on cash entirely risk-free I’d be over the moon. My stocks will recover in time.

And however long it lasts, the recovery won't be synchronized exactly with the market. So the market might start recovering say a month to a quarter or even more in advance. So we need to start investing while things are looking bad. Average recession lasts 15 months. If we hesitate and wait for the economy to confirm a recovery, the market will already rip.\n\nI think the key earnings will be the airlines & banks in whichever quarter the recovery is confirmed. They will report first, calendar-wise, and show the leading indicator first, in consumer credit activity, travel, before the retailers like Walmart and Target confirm it.\n\nKind of like how in this last quarter those sectors confirmed the recession even before any uptick in the layoffs happened and bad earnings started trickling in; we didn't actually have to wait for the retailers to post terrible numbers.\n\nMy approach is to follow the earnings of \\~3-4 companies within the sector you're considering investing in. Their guidances should be consistent with each other. It's important to see that multiple CEOs in the industry are on the same page - one may be bullshitting but if everyone is still bullish even now, that's a stronger sign. I would say this describes cybersecurity, having followed the earnings for Crowdstrike, Fortinet, and Palo Alto networks. If they have good billings and revenue growth and forecasts, in spite of the deteriorating macro situation, that's reason for confidence - it means that as budgets are tightening and companies are spending more, these products are not seen as discretionary. If you don't see this, then these are formerly darling areas within tech that you can avoid.\n\nSecondly, how close they are to GAAP profitability, and if not, understanding their cash runway/balance sheets. It's ok if they're leveraged if their debt matures in say 2027+, they locked in good interest rates somewhere in 2021 before yields started rising. If they're burning lots of cash still -> then are they close to positive EBITDA? And if not EBITDA, are they positive free cash flow?\n\nThe companies that are still heavily dependent stock-based compensation (some major culprits being RBLX, LYFT, PLTR and yeah, actually even AMZN) I think are vulnerable.

The problem for Tesla is that none of this is particularly difficult to \"copy\" for other market participants.\n\n**\"AI Leadership\"**   \nIn autonomous Driving wise Tesla is using the same Bosch Sensor Packages as everyone else, their Software is really not much (if at all) better than what the competition has in the Pipeline. \n\n**\"Giga factories are so much more efficient\"**   \nTeslas Gigafabs are a decision to max into streamlined production, that works out thus far because of their headstart.  \nThink about the extremely limited amount of customization options Tesla offers or the complete lack of Body Overhauls to the existing lineup.   \n2 years from now the market will be spoiled for options.  \nTesla will have to compete on the same playing field as everyone else. Their streamlined approach will no longer be an asset, rather they will have to offer the same kind of adaptability that the traditional manufacturers have long optimized towards.   \nSomething like a \"Gigapress\" is not an innovation that only Tesla could pull of, rather it is something traditional manufacturers for good reason very consciously avoid. \n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI have yet to hear convincing arguments for why Tesla can keep their current growth up, it appears much more likely that Tesla will stabilize as an important but in no way dominant player in the EV space. It will not crash to zero but its valuation will eventually come in line with the industry average.", "score": -4, "replies": [{"body": "The things you list to support your belief that Tesla can just be copied or will be hurt by changes in the industry are surface level and lack true analysis.\n\nGlobal recession will be way less of an issue for Tesla compared to legacy auto. Tesla has almost zero debt and has insane profit margins on its cars, so it can afford to decrease prices if it needs to. EV demand is skyrocketing and Tesla’s sales will not be affected by a recession. People want EVs badly and the global demand is outpacing supply. \n\nFord’s CEO has said publicly that its EV are not profitable. Stellantis CEO has continually said they can’t make compelling EVs profitably. Those are the companies that will suffer wildly in a recession. The demand for their ICE cars that actually make a profit is going to begin decreasing while they try to ramp their unprofitable EVs. Good luck with that. \n\nIf it’s easy to “copy” what Tesla is doing, why does it take VW 3X the amount of time to make an EV compared to Tesla? \n\nVW has had several executive meetings the last two years strictly to talk about how to compete with Tesla. In the most-recent one, they discussed how it takes Tesla 10 hours to make an EV and it takes them 30 hours. The takeaway for VW was to attempt to get those 30 hours down to 20 by 2025 or 2026… just copy Tesla, huh?\n\nSo… VW’s best effort at copying Tesla will go to market in 2025 or 2026 and will be twice as slow as 2020 Tesla? That is pathetic. Tesla will keep innovating beyond where it is now, while VW is trying to catch up to what Tesla did 5-6 years ago.  \n\nMost automakers outsource their software.

{"title": "Fed tightening will need to be far greater than current projections - Research paper", "selftext": "Very interesting paper from Larry Summers and a couple other economists I'm not familiar with.\n\nBasically it argues that current inflation is nearly as bad as the late 70s and 80s. And that inflation is not nearly as responsive to Fed policy as many optimists believe. The takeaway being that Fed policy will need to approach Volker Fed levels of restrictive, far in excess of the 3-3.5% rates that the Fed currently projects.\n\nYou've probably heard people say that if we measured inflation now the same way we did in before 1983, inflation would be more like 15% rather than 8.5%. That's true. Inflation now is about as bad as the early 80s. This paper attempts to create comparable metrics for various inflationary periods in US history. It also demonstrates that inflation is not as responsive to Fed rate hikes as some would believe, by showing how the pre-Volker CPI was artificially high and artificially came down more than it would if we measured it as we do today in response to Fed policy.\n\nAll suggesting that the Fed is still wildly behind the curve and much more restrictive policy will be required to tame inflation. Perhaps as restrictive as the Volker Fed, which sent the US into a severe recession. Strongly encourage everyone to give this a read. Worth noting that Summers has been correct so far in this inflation cycle and the optimists all have egg on their face.\n\nAs for the impact on stocks if Summers is correct - Bad, very bad.\n\n[https://www.nber.org/system/files/working\\_papers/w30116/w30116.pdf](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w30116/w30116.pdf)", "id": "v9ki29", "created_utc": 1654903656.0, "score": 265, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 126, "comments": [{"body": "I mean if bond rates hit those kinds of numbers then I’m dumping my cash into that shit bruv", "score": 100, "replies": [{"body": "Locking in 20% interest rates would b glorious.

The Authorized Shares Amendment provides for an increase in the number of authorized shares of Tesla’s common stock from 2,000,000,000 shares to 6,000,000,000 shares. The Authorized Shares Amendment would not change the total number of authorized shares of Preferred Stock.\n\nReasons for the Proposed Amendment\n\nThe primary purpose of the Authorized Shares Amendment is to facilitate a 3-for-1 split of our common stock in the form of a stock dividend (the “Stock Split”). As of June 6, 2022, we have 1,036,390,569 shares of common stock outstanding, and the current number of authorized shares of our common stock is 2,000,000,000, which is insufficient to effectuate the Stock Split. Our Board intends to approve the Stock Split, subject to and contingent upon stockholder approval of the Authorized Shares Amendment.\n\nOur success depends on attracting and retaining excellent talent, not only through providing a respectful, safe, inclusive and equitable workplace, but also through offering outstanding benefits and highly competitive compensation packages. Unlike other manufacturers, we offer every employee the option of receiving equity. Since our stock split in August 2020 to June 6, 2022, our stock price has risen 43.5%. While this value appreciation has led to our employees benefiting enormously through the years, we want to make sure all employees, no matter when they join, have access to the same advantages. We believe the Stock Split would help reset the market price of our common stock so that our employees will have more flexibility in managing their equity, all of which, in our view, may help maximize stockholder value. In addition, as retail investors have expressed a high level of interest in investing in our stock, we believe the Stock Split will also make our common stock more accessible to our retail shareholders.", "score": 8, "replies": []}, {"body": "Elon we wanted 10:1, try again.", "score": 8, "replies": []}, {"body": "TSLA Outstanding Shares Will Triple In 2022", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "CopyCatEdwin 🤣", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "I feel like I added value to your original joke ❤️", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Just kidding.

His car seats weigh 25 pounds, so total weight for car is 4520-25= 4495 lbs.\n\nAccording to what I find MY LR is 4,363 lbs. \\*According to manual it's 4393 unladen, so even lower, but including charging cables and the red case with danger triangle might make up for the 20 pounds.\n\nThe LR should have bigger battery pack since it has more range and the 4680 should be lighter at same battery pack because of improvements. This shows the new 4680 to be heavier than the older 2170 with bigger capacity.\n\nHe stated his weight at 275, so if weighing was done at different time than what I expect (somebody here know more about this weighing station?), car weight would be 4220. That would be a 3,3% reduction while battery pack is smaller and that still seems less than a reduction vs difference in battery pack size that is implied by range.\n\nAny thoughts? Even if they are software limiting a bigger pack (equal to LR), it still seems wrong.\n\nEdit: According to battery presentation, new casting and load carrying battery pack should make for a 10% reduction in weight.

Employees can set aside a % of their paycheck to purchase TSLA shares at 85% of market value on a set date once per quarter.

Assuming 3 total shifts ultimately that maxes out to 1/12th of total capacity per GA which is 800 per week so they'd max out the current setup at 1600/week. Then 3200 later in Q3 and then probably a slightly slower ramp starting in Q4 through Q1 and Q2 to get to full capacity with the battery factory.\n\nIf GA1 reaches 2/3rd capacity EOQ at let's say 85% of max runrate through Q3 that is 1360/week and let's say 40% of that as an average for GA2. Would work out to about 25k in the next quarter. Then two shifts can do 35k in Q4 plus I gotta assume they pick up a third shift by then, adding maybe another 25% capacity on average throughout the quarter so 44k in Q4 and ultimately 55k in Q1. 4680 will go slower at maybe 5k cars in Q4, 20k in Q1 and 55k in Q2.\n\nTotals for Berlin are estimated to be \\~9k for Q2, 25k in Q3, 49k in Q4, 75k in Q1 and 110k in Q2.

Electric self driving trucks could undercut the world trucking business while disrupting taxi services worldwide as well.\n2. Humanlike robots is another world disrupting service. They could replace so many human workers. But think of all the money spent on robot vaccuum cleaners now, replace that with a robot that can clean more than just the floor and also take stairs. They could also clean bathrooms, kitchens, potentially cook. They could make incredible margins but there's also the possibility to lease these products out. Companies or individuals don't buy robots but lease them, even bigger margins.\n3. Utilities, they could take over more than peaker plants and have a virtual energy network with massive storage combined with renewable energy. Once they have massive capital they don't need to sell energy projects that make a lot of money for other entities, they can become the biggest powerhouse that has ever existed. This coming out of current Tesla energy business.\n4. Battery production. This will be a huge business, Tesla could take a big piece of the pie.

Point 5 depends on what Tesla sets as their goals. If they focus on 3 it might leave less room to electrify other vehicles, but still room to implement their tech elsewhere, like heat pumps for homes.

Sears \n\nIt's hard to predict the future, but one thing is almost certain: Electric cars will be more popular tomorrow than they are today. The recent surge in oil and gas prices will likely cause seismic shifts in consumer demand and vehicle preferences. Many people are paying almost double what they did a year ago to fill up their cars and trucks. \n\nOil prices are unlikely to decline anytime soon, with demand outstripping supply. It's a major reason why the world has been blanketed by extraordinary inflationary pressures that have prompted central banks to raise interest rates -- which, in turn, has sparked fears of a global recession. \n\nBuying an expensive car that runs on batteries might seem like an odd way to save money -- and it is for most people. But the investment theme is worth considering. Shares of major electric-vehicle makers have been banged up this year far more than the S&P 500 index. Tesla stock (ticker: TSLA), for instance, is down more than 30%, and Rivian Automotive (RIVN) is down more than 70%. \n\nEV companies are battling production issues and dealing with inflationary pressures, like everyone else, but demand for their products is growing despite the challenges facing the economy and consumer wealth. Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently said that production, not consumer demand, was a key challenge. \n\nAnyone who is interested in monetizing the EV theme can consider what we have long called the time-arbitrage strategy. The approach involves selling short-term put options to potentially acquire stocks that are worthy long-term holdings -- while collecting an options premium if the stock stays above the strike price. (Puts give buyers the option to sell an underlying asset at a specific price within a set period.) \n\nConsider Tesla, an admittedly controversial company that has probably done more than any other to birth the EV age. With Tesla's stock at $725.60, investors who are willing to warehouse the shares for at least three to five years could sell Tesla's August $500 put for about $17.50. The cash-secured put sale positions investors to buy the stock at an effective price of $482.50 ($500 strike price minus a $17.50 options premium). \n\nA lot can happen between now and the Aug. 19 expiration, but it would have to be extremely bad. The August $500 put is about 31% below Tesla's current stock price. An effective price of $482.50 -- a price last seen in late 2020 -- means the stock would be about 61% below its 52-week high. \n\nThe distance between the put and the equity was chosen to provide somewhat of a margin of safety, but this approach isn't suitable for everyone. Tesla is a volatile stock, and Musk might be even more volatile. He is embroiled in a takeover of Twitter (TWTR) that he seems to be trying to exit. Who knows what will happen? \n\nMore important, it's hard to escape dour predictions about the economy. If people become even more skittish about spending money, especially on cars, Tesla's stock price could weaken even more than it already has. \n\nStill, should the stock price be above the put strike at expiration, investors can keep the put premium and consider resetting the trade to keep the strategy alive. If the stock price is below the strike price at expiration, investors are obligated to buy the stock or to adjust the put to avoid assignment. \n\nIn time, electric vehicles could be as ubiquitous as Apple's (AAPL) iPhone. It's hard to know just when that could occur, and the road might be rocky, but the future of automobiles is unlikely to be like the past. b \n\nSteven M.

Covid put a lot of extra strain on everything and with pandemic tensions decreasing you could see the world going back to normal, it was the perfect opportunity in his eyes. His objective is to gain back territory, Belarus basically belongs to Russia with Lukanhesko in charge, this approach failed in Ukraine so they use force. Other neighbouring countries do see Belarus and Ukraine and even in Belarus there's a lot of protest, if Russia loses Ukraine, they might quickly lose Belarus and lose the massive control they have over other places like Georgia.\n\nMaybe it was best time for this war from his perspective, but they won't ever be able to hold Ukraine, they mostly hate Russia there, can't occupy forever. NATO will be joined by countries on Russia's border. He's now casually talking about taking back Estonia to distract.

America no longer rewards those who are financially responsible. Debt is a part of life. Having debt is the only way to get yourself into more debt like a better house or car everything needing an excellent credit score.\n\nOh, you paid off your student loans? Get a car. Oh you paid off your car? Buy a house. Oh you paid off your house? Save for your kid's six figure college fund. Oh all that's done? Hope you have enough left for retirement and enjoy your last 10 years of life, thanks for contributing to society with your 9-5 life.\n\nWe all need to hit it big. That's why we're here. Fuck those 1% saving accounts. Go for the millions. If you don't make it, it doesn't matter anyways because most of us will die working. But at least you would have tried, which is more than the most.\n\nI Finally achieved goal of getting account to seven figures and now I decided not to buy any call/put options but might sell some occasionally.\n\nGood luck to all you degenerates, keep fighting and one day you will win or get lucky just like I did!!\n\nLink to portfolio snapshot [here](https://imgur.com/a/ZHAk2bB)", "id": "v9go4p", "created_utc": 1654892589.0, "score": 1876, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 292, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|7|**First Seen In WSB**|2 years ago\n**Total Comments**|95|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|5 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=v9go4p)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=v9go4p)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Duck yeah dude!\nRespect.\nAlso fuck you. \nCongrats", "score": 587, "replies": [{"body": "dude really used duck and fuck in the same sentence", "score": 163, "replies": [{"body": "So did you!", "score": 43, "replies": [{"body": "Gottem", "score": 11, "replies": []}, {"body": "Dufuck you say?", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Always has been", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "[Always has been](https://i.imgur.com/88GNMr8.png)\n\n^^^this ^^^has ^^^been ^^^an ^^^accessibility ^^^service ^^^from ^^^your ^^^friendly ^^^neighborhood ^^^bot", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Fellow iPhone person, hello and duck you", "score": 41, "replies": [{"body": "iPhone prisoner", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Quack quack mother fucker", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Quack quack quack", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "OP just buy an Audi R8 instead of a Q5", "score": 119, "replies": [{"body": "Lol I might", "score": 45, "replies": [{"body": "I spent a few years blowing money after I made a bunch, traveling, had a Z4 for a while, now since I've learned more, the best idea is to become a Honda Civic man, buy a small house in a very LCOL city, and you can hit up vegas a few times a year where you just rent the R8 and a hot lady for a weekend, then go back to your frugal life and sell premium/make 5k/week.
