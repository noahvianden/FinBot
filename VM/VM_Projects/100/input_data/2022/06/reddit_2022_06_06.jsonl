This is something you can actually build a strat around.\n\nOne key limitation to keep in mind is that you *don't want to hold an option position through the split*. Get in and out before the split's effective date, at least with respect to options contracts. Holding shares would be fine.\n\nWhy? Even though it is an N for 1 split, that can still result in oddball contract adjustments that may harm your liquidity. For example, it's a 20:1 split, so any strike that doesn't divide evenly by 20 will end up fractional, like 1 x 2345 = 20 x 117.25. Unless all the other strikes also end in .25, new traders will tend to steer clear of the oddball strikes.\n\nFor the strats themselves, I would break down the opportunities into two parts.\n\nPart 1 - 4% rise 1 month before split. You want a bullish play that doesn't expect large changes in IV. There are a number of strats that can take advantage of that, but the most common are a long call (debit strat) or a short put (credit strat). You can pick a 45 DTE expiration that ends before the effective date of the split.\n\nPart 2 - Price increases after split. Once the split is effective, you can repeat the same trades, though perhaps with 60 DTE expirations that you roll every 30 days until you capture most of the expected price move. Or, you could sell calls with the oddball strikes on the assumption that people will want to dump out of them as quickly as possible, depressing prices. But that window may be very narrow, like just a few days after the effective date, if it exists at all.

The record inventory levels I have seen in balance sheets in Q1 and Q2 make it pretty obvious that even price reductions and extensive marketing are not working down inventories.  \n\nI'm only trying to figure out what the next likely scenario with a high level of confidence to try to find the sector and drill down to a small group of companies that can take advantage of this period and set themselves up for the longer term.\n\nI may be totally off but it looks as though there will be a likely stall with even the well off deciding to defer new investments.  With the shorts in full control and nobody to buy the dip if retail runs out of capital or does the same as the larger investors we may well see worse than 08 by far.\n\nAny resources or articles that would help me understand knock on effects of these interrelationships would be very helpful.  ***I really appreciate your help in this*** as it is difficult to grasp but I want to re-learn to be a more complete investor instead of getting caught up in capital flows.

Hence I’m stupid and can’t do anything else more promising in tech. \n\nThink about your first interactions with a computer. Word processing maybe? Kids are not using Word these days, like at all. Maybe you first word processed with Word. Maybe you grew up with Office products. This generation isn’t. \n\nEdit: They’re not using PowerPoint, they’re using Slides. They’re not using Excel, they’re using Sheets. They’re not using Outlook, they’re using Gmail. They’re not using Microsoft Teams, they’re using Zoom, and then in 2nd for video conferencing they’re using Google Meet. Office isn’t necessarily Microsoft’s primary business, but the battle between Microsoft and Google is a battle for mass adoption. And Google right now is planting seeds to have an iron grip on Gen Z when they enter the private sector later on. Microsoft will have to fight to hold market share and I reckon they’ll lose vs Google long term. The game is a fight for mass adoption, and there’s numerous ways to monetize mass adoption. Want a cheap Windows computer that’s sub $300? They absolutely suck, they’re terrible. Want a Chromebook that’s sub $300? They’re decent, snappy useable machines. Look to the developing world. As network infrastructure improves, cheap web based Chromebooks will continue to be a hit among low income consumers in developing nations. Who’s better positioned to scale as the world gets more and more connected? My vote is for Google. Market share of Chrome OS has skyrocketed the last couple of years: https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/02/the-worlds-second-most-popular-desktop-operating-system-isnt-macos-anymore/?amp=1\n\nGoogle is the most evil company in the world. And as the evil geniuses they are, they’re thinking decades ahead. They know that their long term future depends on kids getting hooked on their products, so that when they’re leaders of companies in the future, their company is powered by Google Workspace and not Office. Google beat Microsoft and Apple in the education market. ChromeOS now has more market share than MacOS. Kids are doing all of their productivity tasks in the Google ecosystem. Remember back in 2016/17 when you might have said to yourself, “why do all these kids want to be Youtubers when they grow up?” I know why this happened. I’ve seen the district dashboard data. YouTube is the #1 site kids use on their school issued Chromebook.\n\nEdit: You might say to yourself, Apple won the education market in the 80s/90s, but the enterprise market is still driven by Microsoft. Back then there were like 10 Macs in a lab for 500 kids to share. What Google has accomplished is way more impactful. Literally every kid 1 to 1 in public schools now has a Chromebook in their backpack. This is much more groundbreaking than what Apple did and will help Google retain a generation’s worth of customers as they age into adulthood.\n\nOffice products will do well for the next 20 years in enterprise settings. And then all of the sudden Google Workspace will be king in enterprise. Why? Because they planted the seeds and won the public education market and brainwashed millions of kids.\n\nTLDR.

Both scammers (as far as I know he does not care about human \"spammers\") and bots being used to manipulate ratings, likes and subscriptions. Current hickup is Twitter failing to provide adequate numbers on how many bots there is on the site and failing to provide a concrete method on how they number them. Elon explaining that the best case is just them being clueless and the worst is them being intentionally malicious.\n\n- humans are allowed free speech within the boundaries of the law. Now what law apply is VERY unclear and it's not like this is unique. Normally the law apply to the country it's domiciled on but countries have often put unbearable pressure on foreign sites to see something removed. It's simply logical that Elon is not quite sure which approach to take, only being sure that Twitter must obviously remain lawful. Essentially anything you could say in a public place without being thrown behind bars is fair game, would be my guess. Obviously the issue is raised with countries that officially enforce censorship, but those are usually dealt with either a separate client or just them blocking access. Elon seems focused to deal with covert manipulation before dealing with open manipulation.\n\n- It is likely moderation will remain however everything will be transparent, traçable and quantifiable via an open source of the application's algorithm. The idea being to raise trust and provide accountability now and in the future (perhaps the most important thing) any change or manipulation would be visible.\n\n- marketing is actually a big part of the bot problem. Exposure is rated by how many people supposedly see ads on the site and if you count bots in it, the value drops greatly.\n\nMarketing is done primally through official channels, and more often through main Twitter accounts of brands. People talking and promoting a product is not harmed in any way.\n\nHunting for fraudulent links and scam bots is what he wants to do.

On the other hand, some people might back out of their orders if the economy gets worse and people lose income or get laid off. Tesla is still a strong brand and Western markets do consider it the flagship brand of EVs. \n\nAlso consider that more people are interested in buying EVs this year than ever before, and it's further accelerated by high gas prices. \n\nPersonally, I do think Tesla's stock is overvalued when you compare it to its competition (car companies that are taking EVs seriously), take a look at these stock prices. I know it's hard to compare them apples to apples, but it's still something to consider:\n\nFord: $13.42\n\nGM: $37.70\n\nHyundai/Kia/Genesis: $37.49\n\nVolkswagen: $22.57\n\nVolvo: $18.56\n\nBYD: $76.61\n\nRivian: $28.97\n\nThe average of just these is ~$33.62. Again, it's hard to directly compare as some of these are dividend stocks which are generally cheaper than growth stocks, and some of these have been split whereas Tesla has not.\n\nThat average is pretty low compared to the astronomical value of Tesla. Keep in mind that Tesla is more of a technology company than a car one, and that they also have other assets like their supercharger network and battery R&D. What's strange about Tesla to me is how much hype is behind it and how much a loyal fanbase Elon has behind him. Yes they have a good product but many of the legacy carmakers are catching up and have plenty of cash and assets behind them. To me, it's a meme stock at the current price, but I feel like a more realistic price range for them is $80-200. It's probably a clown take, as this stock tends to just jump at whatever Elon does. Main reason it's down is because of Elon selling stocks to have enough cash to buy Twitter, and because he sold at the top like anyone else would in his position.\n\nTLDR: I'm bearish on Tesla, but reality doesn't seem to affect them as much as it does other EV and car stocks due to hype and Elon Musk simps.

Well, turns out that a big chunk of it is from *most recent sales price of similar properties*.

This generally occurs when the sale benefits the buyers, and it’s usually when the property is a shithole that the buyer plans to renovate and resell. The waiving of the inspection is because the sale will be for much less than the buyer plans on reselling and/or the buyer sees it as a tear down.\n\n4. Refinincing into a traditional mortgage still is limited to the appraisal value and has nothing to do with the cash buyers propping up the market ( I refinanced during all of this going on).\n\nThe market for residential housing went up for similar reasons as why the stock market went up but the two are not directly related (favorable market rates helped). Correlation not causation.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "1. Yes, that is the case if you want to argue semantics. A mortgage bank is not lending the money to buy property so literally speaking the loan is not \"backed by a bank\" until the refi happens. That's why it's considered a \"cash sale\". This is precisely my point. The problem here is that a LOT of people don't actually understand this. They read \"Someone paid $300k over asking in cash! I can't buy a house here!\" on reddit or in clickbait news articles and imagine a Chinese national with a briefcase full of Benjamins or some guy with millions parked in a savings account. Otherwise, though, there is still an institution that is holding your assets and loaning you money at a given interest rate and then you use that money to buy real estate. It's not the same but it kinda rhymes doesn't it? The key here is the utilization of leverage\n2. I don't think that we're going to see 2008 ver.2: Electric Boogaloo, either, but I also think it's a bit too flippant to say that there is NO risk. Macroeconomic systems are too complex for anyone to know what's going to happen with absolute certainty and there are a few too many unprecedented events going on right now on top of that. Yes, people who aren't silly are going to refi once they've closed on a property because it'd be stupid to get margin-called over a house. In that case there is no direct relationship between a crash in equities vs. real estate. What we do know, however, is that asset classes of all types are strongly correlated. Then there are people like [this guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/v7z7ml/guy_uses_margin_to_buy_real_estate_and_gets/) who is about to get to get sunk because they bought real estate *purely on margin*. How common is his situation? I don't know, but the fact that it's possible is already problematic.\n3. There are a lot of assumptions there. Plenty of buyers waive inspections because they feel like they've made a good enough appraisal of the property's condition on their own and/or think they've factored in enough to cover any necessary repairs. Even in the scenario you presented we end up in the same place as before: problematic property valuation. Your buyer made the purchase with the assumption that they could sell it for even more. Sure, the buyer may go through with a $2m new construction home on the $1m plot that they just bought even if the neighbor's homes fall from $2m to $1.75m if they plan to live there. They might figure that they really like the neighborhood, the schools, the restaurants. They may rationalize that they have brand new construction with the latest construction techniques vs. the older homes to justify the additional cost. What happens though if they were hoping to make $500k on a flip and now risk breaking even at best?\n4.
