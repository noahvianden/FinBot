Variable mortgages were simply stress tested at rates and conditions present over the last couple of years when rates were at an all time low. Firstly, the rates are likely to increase beyond what they were tested against. \n\nSecondly, you could get mortgages at up to 5 times your annual pre-tax pay, which is quite a stretch, but also makes it hard to justify average housing cost exceeding $1.2 million and the fact that Canada has now reached new absolute peaks of household mortgage debt. It is higher as multiples of incomes than ever before in history. This is with rates expected to go up further inflating thise historically ballooned debts to fight off inflation. \n\nThirdly, a third of all purchases were made by investors. Most of them leveraged themselves to make those purchases. With housing prices in Canada widely forecasted to go down for years to come, including by the Bank of Canada, combined with expensive debt and liquidity being sucked out of the financial systems, I expect them to start selling off to get out before prices drop more significantly. This is also coming at a time when the governments at all levels are finally working together to vastly increase supply in the years to come. Housing affordability is the number one political issue at the moment.\nAs for investors, nobody wants to hold an investment that's almost guaranteed to lose money in the foreseeable future, that comes with debt that's costing increasingly a lot to service, taken on amounts higher than the value of the now depreciating asset itself.\n\nLastly, recession and job losses are definitely on the radar. The BoC is stuck between that and inflation, and they said it clearly that fighting off inflation will be their top priority, and that they see housing correction as an expected and desirable outcome, rather than something they're trying to avoid.\n\nYou have to remember that even with supply constraints, catching a falling knife once a sell-off happens or is triggered by necessity is going to be difficult purely because there isn't enough money in the system anymore to catch it at anywhere close to the current valuations. The scarcity just adds a thin buffer where companies and people who weren't fully leveraged and still have the cash to afford housing may be able to absorb a couple of thousand of distress sales, but after that runs out and more and more people decide to or are forced to sell, after that it's going to be a freefall. The economy does not support anything close to the current prices. You won't see actual Canadians picking up the falling knife because they can't afford to buy million dollar condos and multi-million houses.\n\nAll in all a prolonged correction is the actual, official target - and that would constitute a soft landing. Having housing decline for a couple of years, to largely flatline after. But actions that are meant to take us there can easily trigger a crash, and with Canadian housing being so out of whack from fundamentals, it would be a big one. While you can't exactly time bubble bursts, this is a very real and an increasingly likely scenario. We never witnessed conditions brewing up that could trigger it more than what we see and expect for the rest of 2022/23.

{"title": "Contrary To Popular Retarded Belief Here, There Was a Stock Market Before the Dot Com Bubble, Jerome Powell Lived/Worked Through It, History Says Fuck Your Calls", "selftext": "Instead of pulling old reliable of presenting a beautiful chart of either the '00 dot com bubble or '08 collapse and saying \"We aRE HErE\", we will do some real DD into something actually similar to today. Most chungus' here don't realize how eerily similar we are to the 1970s bear market that really split some hairs. But before that lets give a little prelude to what happened in the late 60s that set the stage for this market saw a crash of a massive speculative market dubbed the \"gogo era\" that was created by massive investment in high risk speculative investment. Most notably Letter Stock (\\*cough SPACs) which was privately purchased stock that was immediately revalued and sold. Leading to some greasy behavior that Chamath would get a hard on for. With no real reporting requirements funds literally just made up ridiculous returns leading to a massive crash in 1969 version market. \n\nSo now we will transport back to the time of hippies, acid, funk, disco, high inflation, fuel lines, and fun:\n\nInevitably, Vietnam was a massive part, in my opinion, driving the eventual 1974 crash. Instead of printing a fuckton of money to finance you getting a shimmy check to trade while locked down. They were financing the attempt to kill commies. Just like today, they over the fuck did it and removed the United States from the gold standard(I'm not a fucking gold bull), regardless of your opinion of what has happened since then it truly is an uncharted experiment with where they have taken it. \n\nFast forward a few years, the Vietnam war is going terribly, America departs the country in March of 1973 cutting off all supplies leaving South Vietnam to certain defeat, which it did officially in 1975. (Absolutely hilarious when you compare this to Afghanistan).\n\nThen, finally under a small peace, the boat is truly shaken when in October 1973 OPEC headed by the Saudis embargoed shipments of oil to the U.S. and other countries over their support of Israel in the Yom-Kippur War. By March 1974, oil prices had risen 300%. For the half of you with boomer parents, ask them about the gas lines when they were kids, almost every single one will remember vividly the gas shortages and prices. (Wow this totally couldn't be similar in the fact that Russia has skyrocketed oil prices by embargoing western countries over their support of Ukraine in the war.) \n\nExasperated by the political instability caused by the Nixon impeachment process, beginning in 1973 the DOW entered a bear market leading to massive losses. For example, Avon Products, the hot growth stock of 1972, tumbled from $140 a share to $18.50 by the end of 1974; Coca-Cola shares dropped from $149.75 to $44.50. Eventually losing 45% of its value as inflation was entrenched for the rest of the decade. Only being snuffed out by a brazen cigar smoking Paul Volcker who wasn't afraid to say fuck your calls to kill inflation. Guess what? Jerome Powell worked under Paul Volcker so he has seen and experienced the problems of prolonged inflation, and he has seen how it was killed... Whether or not Jerome Powell has the balls to go against the grain telling every government official and the public to fuck off and he will kill inflation by all means necessary? Or will he continue to be paper shake Powell and concede as soon as things get hairy like in 2018?\n\nAnyway, the losses of the market and effects of inflation led to the \"death of the stock market\" by the now famous 1979 article (I highly recommend you read it). A summary taken from the article:\n\n\"There are at least four good reasons why inflation is killing equities:\n\n• Stock prices reflect anticipated corporate profits. During periods of rapid inflation, however, profits fall because most businesses cannot raise prices quickly enough to keep up with costs.\n\n• Even gains in profits are largely illusory because inflation makes them look rosier than they actually are. And because plant and equipment are depreciated at historic cost rather than replacement price, money that should go into capital investing and inventory purchasing instead goes to the government in taxes.\n\n• Experience has taught investors that inflation will lead to an economic downturn that will wreck corporate profitability and stock prices. This happened in 1974, when the worst recession since the Depression followed the last burst of double-digit inflation.\n\n• Investors jump from stocks to bonds to nail down high rates. Inflation also promtps corporations to sell debt because it is tax-deductible and can be paid off in cheaper dollars—thereby reducing the flow of new stocks to market.\"\n\n**Inflation Adjusted Return in the 1970s:**\n\n[Data Source: MacroTrends](https://preview.redd.it/9bgjzq9fx7791.png?width=1266&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f626cc37b616d0886ec846d66d4b61310ba8cb2)\n\nHistory doesn't repeat itself but it sure does rhyme. The reality is what the economy is heading into the hurricane here in a bit, with maybe an eye of the storm along the way. It must be noted that so to this reality is what made people extraordinarily rich, Buffett despite taking massive losses bought massive stakes at great prices that would rocket once inflation was killed leading to a healthy bull run in the 1980s.

My understanding of modern economics is monetary supply and the national debt does not clearly have any direct consequence on inflation because inflation is much more behavioral driven than driven by fundamentals (otherwise why high inflation at times with much lower monetary supply and much lower national debt to GDP ratios). Higher interest rates and the pain raising interest rates cause serve to change behavior and allow the economy to achieve a new equilibrium. Without that intervention, each one of us will continue to raise prices on the goods and services we provide in a vicious cycle that drives inflation up and up. The government will supply all the dollars needed to deal with higher prices as they have no choice (they are the biggest consumer). Only by changing that behavior and stopping the cycle of rising prices do you stop inflation. But higher interest rates, will kill stocks because investment flows will pour into long-term instruments that pay high interest rates (in addition to impacts on profitability and the uncertainty it causes).
