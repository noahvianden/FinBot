He was specifically referring to the roadster in the interview, which was hand built from a Lotus and used Panasonic camcorder batteries.  Rivian has been designed from the start for mass production, the Roadster really wasn't.  Rivian also has value add services either available or in the pipeline.  They have an insurance service, roadside assistance, subscription charger access, etc.  They are trying to create presumably higher margin value add services under the Rivian brand that will, hopefully, make them more profitable.\n\nThat said, they currently have an EV around $10B, and it was as low as $2B going into earnings.  It's not a very valuable company today, no one currently expects them to achieve Tesla level 30% ROIC.\n\nWill they ever be profitable?  I don't know.  The DTC model is just objectively better than the current dealership model in America that all other major manufacturers use.  It is a structural advantage for both Tesla and Rivian.  Yet, economies of scale are so important in auto manufacturing, Rivian might not be able to scale with their available capital.  They say they'll reach positive cash from operations before they run out of money, but that's hard to predict and no CFO is going to come out on call and say \"it's over, our run rate is too deep in the red, we're fucked.\"\n\nI don't think $30 is a bad price point for Rivian, though.  Ford trades at 1.2x book value, Tesla at 25x, Rivian at 1.6x.  You really aren't paying an extreme premium for Rivian's current assets.

Of course Rivian is not gonna trade at a high book value, since they're burning money like crazy. Likewise Ford is making very little money and is investing billions into switching to EVs which they haven't made profitably yet. Both these companies have very clear reasons why they'd trade at low book values.\n\nThe biggest issue Rivian has is that they've always had such easy access to capital that they've become extremely bloated.

Him mentioning Rivian was to demonstrate that Rivian is selling their vehicles for far below what it costs them to make and that volume in-itself won't solve that problem. For example, for the year 2021, Rivian earned $55 million in revenue. The cost to generate that $55 million was $520 million. That means they incurred a loss of $465 million GROSS PROFIT. That means, before the operating expenses are included which in Rivian case, generated a loss of $3.75 billion dollars. So Rivian's issue isn't just related to scaling. The problem they have is every truck they build is costing them way more than they are selling for and scaling alone won't make up that difference.\n\nCan Rivian be profitable? It really depends on battery improvements, scaling, supply chain remedy, and whether or not they can price their vehicles accordingly. Rivian struck gold selling their IPO shares at the price they did. Without that, I'm not sure if they would be capable of last another year. The issue is, it is quite unlikely that Rivian will be profitable for at least another five years considering the fact that pickups require large battery packs, thus, making them much less profitable than light vehicles. For Rivian to breakeven on their vehicles, they will basically only be selling them to wealthy individuals. Certainly, no average person would be able to afford it.\n\nWhat Rivian does have going for them is Ford/Amazon's involvement. Perhaps they can get funding and expertise from those two that Tesla didn't quite have in their early stages. Still, you have to wonder just how much of a role Ford or Amazon will play when the losses start racking up and they themselves are having their own separate issues. Ford, for example, is rapidly trying to dominate the pickup EV category because pickup trucks are their specialty and best selling vehicles. The issue is, F-150 lightnings will be bleeding money. The estimated range is horrible when you consider what is being towed. Expect at least half of what the estimated mileage of the vehicle would be if you're towing something. Since pickup trucks require much more battery cells to operate than light vehicles, unless Ford can price them accordingly, the crowd that purchased their F150 ICE models may be priced out. This is why Tesla hasn't really focused much on their cybertruck. It would be less profitable and they wouldn't even have the batteries and materials to mass manufacture them in a way that wouldn't take away from their existing Model 3 and Y sales. \n\nAs for Tesla's software, that isn't really playing a role for them in terms of profitability at this moment. I believe you will start seeing huge software and services potential when FSD is finally released. Until then, it isn't really a big part of their overall business.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "I really liked how you explained Elon's comment about Rivian\n\nProbably the best way to look at their situation\n\nBut with 20 billion in cash, that should last 4 years", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Since they are losing money every vehicle sold, that means the more they produce, the more money they will lose.

I also believe Tesla is already past their start up/uprising car manufacturer fase, it's one of the new big automakers and for that reason will stay one. It had a head start and without tesla, all the big car companies wouldn't be switching over to ev's this fast. Tesla definitely changed the landscape of cars forever. One big advantage tesla still has are their super charger network. It's fast, it's one of the fastest wildly available charger network out there. Porche has the fastest super chargers but these aren't wildly available and they do have a deal with tesla to use their network. Another reason why Tesla has a strong position (in europe at least, don't know for the usa or china) is that their super charger network is privately owned and build on private land. They don't have to deal with all the stupid time intensive regulations that you have to deal with in the EU. We don't have a clear vision or rules for a super charger network in the EU, in some countries it takes even 2 years of paperwork to just get a few chargers down next to the highway.. Tesla however works with privately owned land from for example hotel resorts. They are able to expand, upgrade and maintain their network pretty well because they just use private space in exchange for some royalties I assume. Paperwork and regulations are way better by this approach by tesla. Using our tesla is definitely less stressful than using our other electric cars. You're absolutely right about the build quality. Our other german electric cars are insanely detailed and build with care, you just can't compare the quality of the tesla in comparison with those cars. Tesla also tends to have a bit more issues in software or damaged/missing car parts than the other cars we have however their service is very good and most of the time not that expensive or even free while the other car manufacturers would make this an expensive occurence..

So, they’ve doubled deliveries from the most recent info at the time of the post. Not 2-3x, but hardly a reduction. Net income was also higher in 2023 than 2022.\n\nSure we can talk about the price reductions in 2023 but that has to be considered in context of the interest rate increases and also worth examining in light of other auto makers essentially shelving EV expansion plans entirely. So, yeah it would seem the reports of Tesla’s demise were greatly exaggerated.\n\nWhat I was definitely wrong about was the stock price prediction, and that I think is attributable to the destruction of the growth narrative, both in terms of volume and margin. And quite frankly I think that’s justified. Now, keep in mind there’s a huge difference between declining growth and shrinking. This post was mainly addressing the extreme bear thesis at the time that Tesla’s deliveries would end up *shrinking* or at least stagnating at 2021 levels. That did not happen. \n\nOverall though I’m not nearly as bullish as I was when I made this post because the strategy seems to be a lot different than what was being articulated back then. At the time, the idea was that 4680 ramp would facilitate the technology improvements and cell supply to create competitive offerings across a wider range of segments, driving substantial volume growth for years to come. That has certainly not happened, and now it’s unclear whether Tesla truly plans to make a lower cost model at all. The extreme bulls have always centered their thesis on FSD, but that was always with the caveat that the vehicle and energy business alone should be worth at least $1 trillion market cap on the strength of high volumes combined with elite manufacturing efficiencies that are not comparable to the existing ICE industry. With the aggressive price cutting strategy we saw last year (which I do believe hurts the brand value), Tesla seems much more willing to sell the hardware at close to break even margins. That makes investing in Tesla seem like much more of an FSD-or-bust proposition, and the FSD roadmap still appears quite uncertain even if its potential remains enormous. \n\n\nI know some people would respond to this by saying something like “oh but Elon said FSD is the difference between Tesla being extremely valuable and being basically worthless” but that was pretty much universally interpreted within the bull community as meaning worthless by comparison, with the statement referring to the comparative magnitude of the FSD opportunity relative to the vehicle + energy business alone. The prevailing thought was that FSD was the difference between being a ~$1-1.5 trillion company vs being a $5-10 trillion company. \n\nThe shift in strategy we saw in 2023 and here in early 2024 has damaged that thesis a lot.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for the thoughts!

{"title": "There is no guaranteed recovery", "selftext": "Everyone in the country knows that there is a risk of a recession. Assuming a recession happens, a lot of people are talking about how the recovery will eventually happens because apparently \"markets always recover\". \n\nI have been watching several videos and reading a few articles about previous recessions and I do not really think a recovery is guaranteed, at least not in the next 10 years. Most economies do not recover from a crash, even though the US has recovered several times. \n\nEven for the United States, some crashes take more than 10 years to recover e.g. most Technology stocks took more than 10 years to recover from the dotcom crash. Stocks have three times trades lower than the previous decade in the United States.\n\nIt is true that the bubble in Japan in the 80s was bigger than the bubble in the US currently but the US economy might still suffer the same fate. The Japanese stock market has simply never recovered since the crash. The reality is that those who bought at the peak in early January or late December might walk away with losses no matter how long they wait.\n\nMy reasoning for this is as follows:\n\n1.  What helped economic recovery in the united states previously was industrial production since US companies eventually produced things to sell. Right now, as more and more American companies produce things abroad and face stiff competition, the outcome might be very different. \n2. Americans no longer like to work as evidenced by the \"great resignation\" and increasing appetite for jobs that are basically effortless. This corresponds to what happened to the Netherlands before collapse, the French before collapse , and the British in the late 1800s. The difference is these countries simply went abroad and acquired colonial territories to do the job - an option that Americans do not have in the modern age. Even the dutch and French still had their economies collapse despite the colonial wealth.\n3. There are new upcoming countries with very low costs of living leading to very low labour costs. These countries can supply the world with food and industrial goods for very cheap. This is making American producers suffer due to the high costs of living in the USA meaning high cost of labour. \n4. American politicians are not willing to take corrective measures to fix the economy out of fear of being voted out ( basically proving Socrates was right in his analogy - people always choose the sweet poison over the bitter medicine hence failure of democracy).  Corrective measures would be abolishing minimum wage and instead looking for ways to reduce cost of living by increasing production, encouraging people to save money other than spend aimlessly, deregulate the market to make it easy for new businesses, etc. No politician will ever do this because of fear of being voted out (the immediate effect will be terrible but the long term effect will be desirable). \n5. Increasing sovereign debt means the more countries find other places to buy products for cheaper, and hence the less the demand for the US Dollar, the more the American economy is in danger. Other countries are also finding alternatives in response to the US freezing Russia's foreign currency reserves.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn conclusion, I think these factors might make it so that the American economy finds it very difficult to undergo any kind of economic recovery after a recession. The conditions needed to recover successfully from a recession are simply not in good supply in the United States.\n\nAnyway, this is just an opinion like any other and I would love to listen to what you guys think about it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR ; the economy might never recover after the crash.", "id": "v4pout", "created_utc": 1654351881.0, "score": 32, "upvote_ratio": 0.6, "num_comments": 144, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|10 seconds ago\n**Total Comments**|0|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 day|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=v4pout)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=v4pout)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "TLDR: this could be the big one boys. \n\nI'm gonna go all in on Pelton.

We’re already seeing some downtick as a result of the fed raising rates. Home prices will come down. Supply chain issues are resolving, gradually, oil prices are high, may remain high, but there’s nothing that can be done about that and it’s a primary driver of inflation right now, not some systemic issue in the market. \n\nIndeed, there isn’t a liquidity crisis like in 2008, and corporate balance sheets are strong, very strong, they can easily ride out this present tough times. \n\nAnd the Economy tho, is strong. Employment good. Earnings may dip a bit, but so what? A couple quarters, does not a summer make. Maybe we see a recession, maybe we don’t, but this isn’t going to somehow collapse the us market. There’s just no reason to conclude that will be the case. \n\nSecond, the us stock market is the only game in town.  Fed isn’t going to raise rates back to 1970s level, that’s never happening again, so bonds are never going to be the asset class they were then. There’s just nowhere else to put money to work, especially because ostensibly every other market i the world is less attractive than the US stock market \n\nFinally, look at the companies. Google apple Microsoft Amazon, these companies have grown massively in the past 2 years; it’s not all inflation, it’s not just free govt money, they really are earnings fuck ton more money. And those names I mentioned, amongst others, have continually shown themselves to innovate and adapt and make more money. Indeed, all of them have growing lines beyond their initial core business\n\n\nAs to the Japanese comparison and all this abouy debts and what not, obvious caveat that I’m not an economist and I’m just giving my opinion but:\n\nJapan saw basically no GDP growth since 1990.\n\n“From 1991 to 2003, the Japanese economy, as measured by GDP, grew only 1.14% annually, while average real growth rate between 2000 to 2010 was about 1%, both well below other industrialized nations. . .  From 1995 to 2007, GDP fell from $5.33 trillion to $4.36 trillion in nominal terms,[7] real wages fell around 5%.”  - wiki\n\nBut, US GDP has grown, on average, well more than 2-3x the GDP growth of Japan since 1990.\n\nHere’s an interesting chart, from 1990 to 2018, US median hourly wage of all civilian prime-age workers (25-54) (in 2018 dollars), has risen 7%.\n\nhttps://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2019/09/10/are-wages-rising-falling-or-stagnating/\n\nAnother thing that I rarely see discussed when people bring up Japan (or really China, or Russia, or other similar nations), is the massive demographic differences between the USA and Japan.\n\nJapan had / has an aging population, their actually seeing a decrease in population right now and has seen a relatively flat or downward sloping population growth since really the 1990s, or earlier.\n\nThat’s just not the case here.

You don’t NEED a Subaru. You just want it. \n\nThat being said , no matter how much you hate used car dealers I’m honestly curious where you think people would otherwise get used cars. If you’ve ever looked for cars from private party you would quickly see how much protection a licensed used car dealer provides- there’s people out there rolling back odometers, selling cars without valid titles, complete lemons and disappear after sales, etc. \n\nThe value added of a used car dealer is an inspected car that is road worthy, access to financing even though it’s expensive because most lower income customers do not have the cash to pay off a car, making sure the title is properly processed, and being accountable for anything that happens during and after the sale. I don’t see how you can dispute this- there are unscrupulous dealers but if you just look at their reviews you will quickly find out which ones are the bad apples. There’s no way you think buying a 15k car from a random guy on Craigslist would on average be a better experience than from a well reviewed locally owned car dealer. \n\nAnd it’s not scamming other customers. Its taking a deal that makes a little money to move an aged unit. If you came in my dealership and wanted a discount on one of our high demand units there wouldn’t be a chance in hell. \n\n\nThe crux of our argument is how much you deem a fair profit for the sale of a used car.

Average person doesnt have enough incentive to find someone that knows how and is willing to break federal law to roll back the odometer. Dealers and habitual sellers are the only ones that see enough gain to seek these out. (and super high value cars of course)\n\nAs for title issues, ha. Dealers have to work it out the same as anyone else.\nLemon law doesnt apply to used cars.\nUsed car dealers dont support the car after the sale, so its not the the seller disappearing is an issue. Especially since I have their contact info that I verified matches the title.\n  \n>The value added of a used car dealer is an inspected car that is road worthy,\n\nI would still have my own inspection, dealer or not. No diff.\nAnd you KNOW of the huge number of dealerships that sell anything.\n\n> access to financing even though it’s expensive because most lower income customers do not have the cash to pay off a car,\n\nWe all have the internet. You dont even have to have a bank to get financing anymore.\n\n> making sure the title is properly processed, and being accountable for anything that happens during and after the sale. \n\nYeah, the titling process isnt hard... However I admit lots of people have trouble filling out a simple form. I would really like it if these people were incapable of driving.\n\n>I don’t see how you can dispute this- there are unscrupulous dealers but if you just look at their reviews you will quickly find out which ones are the bad apples. \n\nDue to how crowdsourced reviews work, literally every dealership has bad reviews unless they stuff them.\n\n>There’s no way you think buying a 15k car from a random guy on Craigslist would on average be a better experience than from a well reviewed locally owned car dealer.  \n\nThe only difference I see is how with a dealer I have to wait for plates and shit to be mailed to me from the DMV. With private party purchases I can put the title in my name that day and have real plates.\nAlso, it isnt the 1900s anymore. We dont use Craigslist.\n\n>  \n>And it’s not scamming other customers.

After a year you can leave and buy another but this time when they do your DTI measurement they are going to use your income and your rent minus your debt and for mortgage debt is only the principal and interest so lets assume your mortgage is 1200 a month and your P and I is 800 of that. You are renting our the other half for 1000 a month. Lets assume since last mortgage you took out all debts are the same and income is the same you now on paper are making an additional 2400 a year. So you came up with another 15% down bought another duplex and moved in now lets say its all equal again for simple sake, so now you have 4 units and 1 you are living in so 3 units all lets say rent out for the 1000 a month. Two mortgages lets just say 1200 x 2. So you now have 3000 a month in rent coming in and 2400 a month going out thats 600 dollars a month back in your pocket that you get paid to live where you are living. Now next year you go back to the bank assume everything is same again but now your mortgage are 1600 a month but your income is 3000 from leases. You now to the bank are making 16800 more a year but your job pays 30k bank might be offering your like 500-600k mortgages but even with an extra 7000 in rent income above expense your not going to have the money down. so lets say markets moving steady homes were growing 6% a year so you go to private lender and borrow against your duplexes and secure equity loans, this brings your equity down and this is where math comes into play to make sure your not grabbing too much capital versus how much it will drop your dti for borrowing on mortgages. So lets say this time you borrow enough on the other homes to secure a triplex with a 15% down payment. Mortgage is lets say 1600 for simpleness. So 1600+1200+1200+600 (from equity loan) 4600. You now have 7 units one you must live in. So 6000 a month so 1400 a month above costs.

But point is more to illustrate how ones borrowing power grows as you expand rentals and how it starts to have a compounding effect pretty early and quickly. Even then in this market as rates pass 5% this way to a early retirement has basically closed.

They usually drive them for <2 years before turning them in on a new one.\n\nThere really isn't a market for that 2 year old luxury SUV, because the people who can afford to pay 80% of the MSRP, are probably buying new. \n\nThe next factor is that the maintenance costs don't magically diminish with the resale value, so they are still immensely expensive to service and often have many issues (party because their quality is incredibly overrated, and partly because the more complex a vehicle is the more things tend to go wrong). \n\nSo these vehicles sort of linger around lots until they get marked down to a point where they are attractive to the second owner.\n\nNow the second owner can't afford to maintain it and they will drive it until so many issues have piled up that it is more economical to just trade it in on something different/less expensive. \n\nBy the time you get the the third owner, these things have a whole laundry list of issues and no one wants to touch them with a 10 foot pole, because the cost of repair exceeds the market value of the vehicle.  Early 2000's mercs had issues with the vegetable based wiring harness insulation failing and replacing the ENTIRE wiring harness was at the time a $16k job (the whole car had to be disassembled and re-assembled).

She sold it to me for 10k under KBB and as a non extended warranty believer I wanted her to recoup some of her overpaid loses.\nI had just titled and licensed it in my name too.

I'm not a believer in the product but as many commented above, it's gotta be at a fair or negotiable price. \nWe have similar first names so either they didn't catch the change in ownership or someone in the claims department didn't use due diligence before writing a check.

I know that splits are have no intrinsic value, it doesn't mean that they are actually \"cheaper\" but it does have a phycological affect on average traders who don't have millions to invest.

Regarding the current fee, yea it’s high, but it’s the annual rate, meaning it’s 80% per year, about 30 cents a day for GME, and more importantly, it’s variable, not constant. It’s not locked in. The rate is dictated by simple supply and demand. As the fee grows, a small number of shorts close and the price comes back down. Mind you, right now available shares to borrow is 0-1,000. That coming up to 10,000, or 30,000 just to be conservative, will bring it down to the very low rate it has been for a while.
