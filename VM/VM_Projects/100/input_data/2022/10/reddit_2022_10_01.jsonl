{"title": "Facebook scrambles to escape stock’s death spiral as users flee, sales drop", "selftext": "A year ago, before Facebook had turned [Meta](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/META), the social media company was sporting a market cap of [$1 trillion](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/28/facebook-hits-trillion-dollar-market-cap-for-first-time.html), putting it in rarefied territory with a handful of U.S. technology giants.\n\nToday the view looks much different. Meta has lost about two-thirds of its value since peaking in September 2021. The stock is trading at its [lowest](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/16/meta-shares-plunged-14percent-this-week-falling-close-to-their-pandemic-low.html) since January 2019 and is about to close out its third straight quarter of double-digit percentage losses. Only four stocks in the [S&P 500](https://www.slickcharts.com/sp500/performance) are having a worse year.\n\nFacebook’s business was built on network effects — users brought their friends and family members, who told their colleagues, who invited their buddies. Suddenly everyone was convening in one place. Advertisers followed, and the company’s ensuing profits — and they were plentiful — provided the capital to recruit the best and brightest engineers to keep the cycle going.\n\nBut in 2022, the cycle has reversed. [Users are jumping ship](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/02/facebook-parent-meta-fb-q4-2021-earnings.html) and advertisers are reducing their spending, leaving Meta poised to report its second straight drop in quarterly revenue. Businesses are removing Facebook’s once-ubiquitous [social login button](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/08/facebook-login-button-disappearing-from-websites-on-privacy-concerns.html) from their websites. Recruiting is an emerging challenge, especially as founder and CEO [Mark Zuckerberg](https://www.cnbc.com/mark-zuckerberg/) spends much of his time proselytizing the metaverse, which may be the company’s future but accounts for virtually none of its near-term revenue and is costing billions of dollars a year to build.\n\nZuckerberg [said](https://about.fb.com/news/2021/10/founders-letter/) he hopes that within the next decade, the metaverse “will reach a billion people” and “host hundreds of billions of dollars of digital commerce.” He [told](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/22/mark-zuckerberg-envisions-1-billion-people-in-the-metaverse.html) CNBC’s Jim Cramer in June that the “North Star” is to reach those sorts of figures by the end of the decade and create a “massive economy” around digital goods.\n\nInvestors aren’t enthusiastic about it, and the way they’re dumping the stock has some observers questioning if the downward pressure is actually a [death spiral](https://twitter.com/heychriscurtis/status/1555934959877074944) from which Meta can’t recover.\n\n“I’m not sure there’s a core business that works anymore at Facebook,” said Laura Martin of Needham, the only analyst among the 45 tracked by FactSet with a sell rating on the stock.\n\nNobody is suggesting that Facebook is at risk of going out of business. The company still has a dominant position in mobile advertising and has one of the most profitable business models on the planet. Even with a 36% drop in net income in the [latest quarter](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/27/facebook-parent-meta-earnings-q2-2022.html) from the prior year, Meta generated $6.7 billion in profit and ended the period with over $40 billion in cash and marketable securities.\n\nThe Wall Street problem for Facebook is that it’s no longer a growth story. Up until this year, that’s the only thing it’s known. The company’s slowest year for revenue growth was the pandemic year of 2020, when it still expanded 22%. Analysts this year are predicting a revenue drop.\n\nThe number of daily active users in the U.S. and Canada has fallen in the past two years, from 198 million in mid-2020 to 197 million in the second quarter of this year. Globally, user numbers are up about 10% over that stretch and are expected to increase 3% a year through 2024, according to FactSet estimates.\n\n“I don’t see it spiraling in terms of cash flows in the next few years, but I’m just worried that they’re not winning the next generation,” said Jeremy Bondy, CEO of app marketing firm Liftoff.\n\nSales growth is expected to hover in the single digits for the first half of 2023, before ticking back up. But even that bet carries risks. The next generation, as Bondy describes it, is now [moving over to TikTok](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/29/tiktok-looms-large-in-tech-earnings-from-google-facebook-amazon.html), where users can create and view short, viral videos rather than scrolling past political rants from distant relatives with whom they mistakenly connected on Facebook.\n\nMeta has been trying to mimic TikTok’s success with its short video offering called Reels, which has been a major focus across Facebook and Instagram. Meta plans to increase the amount of algorithmically recommended short videos in users’ Instagram feeds from 15% to 30%, and Bondy speculates the company will likely “get tremendous revenue flow from that” algorithmic shift.\n\nHowever, Facebook acknowledges it’s early days for monetizing Reels, and it’s not yet clear how well the format works for advertisers. TikTok’s business remains opaque because the company is privately held and owned by China’s ByteDance.\n\n[Sheryl Sandberg](https://www.cnbc.com/sheryl-sandberg/), who’s [leaving](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/01/facebook-coo-sheryl-sandberg-says-she-is-stepping-down.html) the company Friday after more than 14 years as chief operating officer, said in her final earnings call in July that videos are harder than photos in terms of ads and measurement, and that Facebook has to show businesses how to use the ad tools for Reels.\n\n“I think it’s very promising,” Sandberg said, “but we’ve got some hard work ahead of us.”\n\nSkeptics such as Martin see Facebook pushing users away from the core news feed, where it makes tons of cash, and toward Reels, where the model is unproven. Martin says Zuckerberg must know something important about where the business is headed.\n\n“He wouldn’t be hurting its revenue at the same time he needs more money, unless he felt like the core business wasn’t strong enough to stand alone,” Martin said. “He must feel he has to try to move his viewership to Reels to compete with TikTok.”\n\nA Facebook spokesperson declined to comment for this story.\n\nZuckerberg has at least one major reason for concern beyond just stalled user growth and a slowing economy: [Apple](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL).\n\nThe 2021 iOS privacy update, called App Tracking Transparency, undermined Facebook’s ability to target users with ads, costing the company an estimated [$10 billion](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/02/facebook-says-apple-ios-privacy-change-will-cost-10-billion-this-year.html) in revenue this year. Meta is counting on artificial intelligence-powered advertising to eventually make up for Apple’s changes.\n\nThat may amount to little more than a Band-Aid. Chris Curtis, an online marketing expert and consultant, has seen social networks rise and fall as trends change and users move along. And that problem isn’t solvable with AI.\n\n“I’m old enough, and I was there when MySpace was a thing,” said Curtis, who previously worked at [Anheuser-Busch](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BUD) and McKinsey. “Social networks are switchable, right?”\n\nWhen you look at Meta’s user numbers, Curtis said, they suggest the company is “not in a good position.”\n\n## ‘Force for good or evil’\n\nThe last time Facebook’s market cap was this low, it was early 2019 and the company was dealing with the continued fallout of the [Cambridge Analytica](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/10/facebook-cambridge-analytica-a-timeline-of-the-data-hijacking-scandal.html)privacy scandal. Since then, Facebook has suffered further reputational damage, most notably from the documents leaked last year by whistleblower and former employee [Frances Haugen](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/04/facebook-whistleblower-reveals-identity-ahead-of-60-minutes-interview.html).\n\nThe main takeaway from the Haugen saga, which preceded the name change to Meta, was that Facebook knew of many of the harms its products caused kids and was unwilling or unable to do anything about them. Some U.S. senators compared the company to [Big Tobacco](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/30/senators-say-facebook-used-big-tobacco-playbook-to-exploit-kids.html).\n\n[Denise Lee Yohn](https://deniseleeyohn.com/), author of brand-building books including “What Great Brands Do” and “Fusion,” said there’s little evidence to suggest that Facebook’s rebranding to Meta late last year has changed public perception of the company.\n\n“I think the company still suffers from a lot of criticism and skepticism about whether they are a force for good or evil,” Yohn said.\n\nRehabilitating a damaged brand is difficult but not impossible, Yohn said. She noted that in 2009, [Domino’s Pizza](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/DPZ) was able to successfully come back from a crisis. In April of that year, a video made as a [prank](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/16/business/media/16dominos.html) by two restaurant employees went viral, showing one of them doing disgusting acts with food while cooking in one of the company’s kitchens. Both employees were arrested and charged with food contamination.\n\nIn December 2009, Domino’s launched a marketing blitz called the [“Pizza Turnaround.”](https://blog.unincorporated.com/dominos-brand-crisis) The stock climbed 63% in the first quarter of 2010.\n\nYohn said the company’s approach was, “We’ve been told our pizzas suck, and so we’re actually going to make substantive changes to what we are offering and change people’s perceptions.” While it sounded initially like “just marketing speak,” Yohn said, “they actually really did change.”\n\nZuckerberg, on the other hand, is not “coming across as a leader who is serious about changing his culture and about changing himself and about kind of creating a company that will be able to step into the future that he’s envisioning,” she said.\n\nMeta’s reputational hit could also harm the company’s ability to recruit top-tier talent, a stark contrast to a decade ago, when there was no more prized landing spot for a hotshot engineer.\n\nA former Facebook ad executive, who spoke on condition that his name not be used, told CNBC that even though TikTok is owned by a Chinese parent, it now has an edge over Meta when it comes to recruiting because it’s viewed as having less “moral downside.”\n\n[Ben Zhao](https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~ravenben/), a computer science professor at University of Chicago, said he’s seeing that play out on the ground as an increasing number of students in his department are showing interest in working for TikTok and ByteDance.\n\nIn order to stay competitive, given how the market has punished tech stocks this year, Zhao said, Meta and [Google](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GOOGL) are “having to pay more and are having certainly to hand out more lucrative stock options and packages.”\n\n## The bull case\n\nStill, Zuckerberg has a history of proving his doubters wrong, said Jake Dollarhide, the CEO of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n\nDollarhide remembers when investors ran from Facebook not long after its 2012 IPO, scoffing at the company’s ability to move “from the PC to the mobile world.” Facebook’s mobile business quickly caught fire and by late 2013, the stock was off to the races.\n\nZuckerberg’s success in pivoting to mobile gives Dollarhide confidence that Meta can cash in on its bet-the-farm move to the metaverse. In the second quarter, Meta’s Reality Labs division, which houses its virtual reality headsets and related technologies, generated $452 million in revenue, about 1.5% of total Meta sales, and [lost $2.8 billion](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/27/meta-reality-labs-lost-2point8-billion-in-q2-2022.html#:~:text=Meta%20lost%20%242.8%20billion%20on%20its%20virtual%20reality%20ambitions%20during%20Q2,-Published%20Wed%2C%20Jul&amp;text=Facebook%20parent%20Meta%20lost%20%242.8,the%20quarter%20ending%20in%20June.).\n\n“I think Zuckerberg is very bright and very ambitious,” said Dollarhide. “I wouldn’t bet against Zuckerberg just like I wouldn’t bet against [Elon Musk](https://www.cnbc.com/elon-musk/).”\n\nDollarhide’s firm hasn’t owned Facebook shares, though, since 2014, preferring the trajectory of tech companies such as Apple and [Amazon](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AMZN), two of his top holdings.\n\n“The reality is they can be perceived as a value company and not a growth company,” Dollarhide said, regarding Meta.\n\nNo matter what happens in the next year or two or even three, Zuckerberg has made clear that the future of the company is in the metaverse, where he’s banking on new businesses forming around virtual reality.\n\nZhao, from University of Chicago, says there’s immense uncertainty surrounding the metaverse’s prospects.\n\n“The real question is — are daily users ready for the metaverse yet?” Zhao said. “Is the underlying technology ready and mature enough to make that transition seamless? That’s a real question and that may not be all up to Facebook or Meta at this point.”\n\nIf Zuckerberg is right, perhaps 10 years from now Meta’s stock price from the depths of 2022 will look like the discount of the decade. And if that happens, predictions of a death spiral will be mocked like a 2012 [cover story from Barron’s](https://ritholtz.com/2012/09/barrons-covers-story-facebook-worth-15/), headlined “Facebook is worth $15” with a thumb pointing down.

Tik Tok is basically just blanketing ads to an age group based on interests. I believe you can set up conversion tracking to pass to them, but it's more of a platform for reach.\n\nFacebook, pre iOS14.5 would let you upload a list of customers and then find a \"lookalike audience\" that was scarily accurate at generating leads. They've now lost their ability to create the feedback loop that fueled that engine (3rd party cookies), which initially made their advertising worthless (80% less leads at 5x cost per lead YoY for us in a short stretch before we slammed the brakes hard on spending there). They have rebounded significantly in finding ways to properly track conversions and optimize again, but it's nowhere near historical performance. All that said, they do now offer an API for advertisers to use their own first party data to rebuild that loop. The issue is it's not straightforward to set up. We haven't set it up yet, so I can't speak to it, but it may be how they overcome this.\n\nSorry for the long reply, but figure it may be helpful context to some.

Definitely hurt since Facebook did used to help generate customers, but we just cut our spend on Facebook significantly. Again, small fish in their advertising pond (five figure spend monthly), but from everything I've read, it's not an isolated case in terms of performance, so if other advertisers follow suit in cutting spend, it definitely explains the drop FB has seen. And then their billion dollar question becomes, will they be able to get it back by delivering better performance via their conversions API?\n\nEdit: Sorry, realized I totally missed the other half of your question. Google has always been our best performer, but it makes sense given the typical intent of search (we dont do a lot of basic display/banner ads). Their costs in my industry have risen as well (at most doubled for specific programs, but most are only up 20% or less). But Google's change was more people flooding into it during covid in my industry combined with their loosening of how match types work. That said, it's still producing a solid ROI so it's not hurting as much. Amazon isn't a factor in my line of work, so I can't speak to that as well, but I imagine most of their advertising is based on their own 1st party data and what people are searching for so iOS 14.5 wouldn't really touch them.\n\nThe only other platform I use frequently is LinkedIn, which hasn't been great since some update they made in 2018. Although I believe their conversion tool still relies on third party cookies too, so it's interesting they don't get talked about (maybe because they're a small fish on Microsoft's earnings).

But how do they communicate the most? They text! The world isn't waiting for a fourth way to communicate. Communication channels are over saturated as is.\n\n**70 to 93 percent of human communication is non-verbal.** Video chat is not as effective as you'd think in passing this information. You really need to be in a 3D space with the other person, being able to see their whole body. \n\nJust ask anybody that has tried online dating for any length of time. You start off talking to somebody with text, then you might graduate to video chats, and then you finally meet the person in real life.

Why is that?\n\nI can chat with the person for months via text messaging and still not get the same info as being in a real space with them for a couple of minutes. I can chat with them for months via video chat and it's the same thing.\n\nThere's something completely different about being in a real space, with a real person. It's not just the non-verbal communication either. The proximity factor is also huge. When you're in a real space with somebody, your physical actions will cause the other person to react. This can't happen over messages or video chat.

Do you realize how much all travel/hotel companies are going to suffer in the next 20 to 30 years as VR and AR take over? Think of how many business fly their executives across the country and across the world. They put them up in fancy hotels, etc,. \n\nWhy do business do this when these same people can just chat via instant messenger or a video call? The reason that businesses do this, is because they understand how truly important non-verbal communication is. They understand how important it is, to be in the same physical space as someone else, and really understand what the company is trying to teach or explain in these various conferences/meetings.\n\nIn ten years, VR and AR will be so thoroughly dominant, that the idea of flying 100 of your employees to Hawaii for some conference will seem like a silly waste of resources.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause Defy Distance is REAL. There is something that you feel in VR called \"presence\". It's this feeling that you can only get by either being in a very real place, or being in very real VR that can convince your brain. Right now, the feeling of presence isn't super strong. It's weak and fleeting. But VR will continue to steadily improve. The Field of View will get bigger. Your own human body will be tracked in real-time, and magically placed into the experience. The resolution will continue to increase. The sense of \"presence\" will get much stronger and more powerful.\n\nImagine a family that normally makes a very expensive trip to China each year to visit their family on the other side of the world. They don't want to spend all this $$$ every single year going to China, but at the same time, video chat just isn't good enough for them. They want to be in the same physical space as their loved ones.\n\nWhen VR and AR are completely ubiquitous, a family that would normally travel to China every single year, will instead maybe travel there one of out three years.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause at any moment of any day, grandma in China can be sitting in her rocking chair in Guangdong Province, and if you both put on Rayban sized glasses, you can see and hear her as if she was inside your actual living room. In her own rocking chair, looking perfectly natural. It will be 99 percent identical to a \"real-life\" experience.\n\nNow, you might think... Sure, but I can't touch grandma or give her a hug. Or give her a kiss. But gloves with haptic feedback and all sorts of other technologies are being developed that will allow you to get an approximation of feeling when sharing a space with another person. You'll be able to effectively put your hand on their shoulder for example.\n\nWill it feel 100 percent identical to the real thing? No. But 90 percent of the way there is good enough for the great unwashed masses.

{"title": "Peter Lynch: \"If you spend 14 minutes a year on economics, you've wasted 12 minutes.\"", "selftext": "This quote is from his 1994 lecture. It's available on YouTube if you search \"Peter Lynch 1994 Lecture\". I can't post the link here since this sub doesn't seem to allow YouTube links. The sentence in the title is at around 15:50 in the video posted by GiraffeValue.\n\nThe video is quite long and the image quality isn't good due to the age, but I think lots of his advice  are timeless and would be helpful for investors seasoned and new. I  highly recommend going through the whole lecture since it's very informative and quite funny.\n\n**His words leading up to this quote:**\n\nFirst  they tried to predict the stock market. This is a total waste of time.  No one can predict the stock market. Then they tried to predict interest  rate. If anybody can predict interest rate right 3 times in a row, they  would be a billionaire, and there ain't lots of billionaire on the  planet. No one can predict the economy. In 1982 we have 20% prime rate  with double-digit inflation and double-digit unemployment. I don't remember anybody telling me in 1981 about it. I read and study a lot and  I don't remember anybody telling me we're gonna have the worst  recession since depression. What I'm trying to tell you is that it would  be very useful to know what the stock market are gonna do. It'd be  terrific to know the Dow Jones' average a year from now would be X, that  we're gonna have a full-scale recession and the interest rate gonna be 12%. That's useful stuff. You'd never know it though. You just don't get to learn it.\n\n**Philip Fisher, another very successful investor and the author of some great investing books also held similar belief:**\n\nPostponing  an attractive purchase because of fear of what the general market might  do will, over the years, prove very costly. This is because the  investor is ignoring a powerful influence about which he has positive  knowledge through fear about a less powerful force about which, in the  present state of human knowledge, he and everyone else is largely  guessing. (Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits, Ch.6)\n\n**My 2 cents:**\n\nWe've  been seeing lots of posts saying \"Don't fight the feds.\" or \"The  economy's gonna be a lot worse.\" recently. These people could be right  this time, but if they have the ability to consistently predict the  market, they would be making millions and enjoying their life, not  posting on reddit. Even the Feds themselves failed to predict the economy considering how many time they revised their plan for the past year. The best course of action would be keeping DCA into  index funds if you're a boglehead and keep buying stocks of companies  you believed in at reasonable valuation if you're a stock picker.\n\n**For stock pickers, Philip Fisher also wrote about his criteria of a resilient business:**\n\n1. The  product or service provided by the company is recognized by the  customer as being very important for the proper conduct of their  activities.\n2. Inferior or malfunctioning product/ service would cause serious problems for the customer.\n3. No  competitor is serving more than a minor segment of the market so that  the dominant company is nearly synonymous in the public mind with the  source of the supply.\n4. The  cost of the product is only a quite small part of the customer's total  cost of operations so that moderate price reductions yield only very  small savings in relation to the risk of taking a chance on an unknown  supplier.\n5. It  has many small customers rather than a few large ones and it's  customers are sufficiently specialized in different nature so that it's  unlikely for a competitor to reach many of them with a single advertising  media.\n\n(Conservative Investors Sleep Well, Ch.3)\n\n**My 2 cents:**\n\nWhile  it's hard to find a company fitting all of these criteria and it  requires quite a bit of knowledge of certain industry or company to  apply, these rules should be quite useful provided you want to leverage  the knowledge obtained from your work or hobby on your investments.\n\nThis  post is primarily quoting words of great investing minds of the past  since I don't have much to add that is valuable.

Since its publication, the theory has received wider attention, especially in regard to the effect of increasing prices of daily necessities.\r  \n*'The reason that the rich were so rich, Vimes reasoned, was because they managed to spend less money. Take boots, for example. He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles. But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that'd still be keeping his feet dry in ten years' time, while a poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.

If I had to speculate I say we have a slight bounce in the coming weeks. I say this because it is common knowledge that October-January are the best months in the stock market if you look at history. Likewise, after the midterms in the second year of a president's term we tend to do well in the stock market. The reasoning behind this is because the stock market likes to have certainty on what policies will be approved or denied in the future. Will I be buying during this false bounce? Yes, I will be buying up a little into TQQQ to swing trade over the course of a few days here and there, selling once I make a 12% gain in under 4 days. \n\nNow for the meat and potatoes.

It is not only great for long term growth, it also pays a nice dividend yield of 1.77%. \n\n20% of portfolio will be in SCHD - this is another good ETF that is good for growth and has an excellent 3.73%. \n\n10% of portfolio will be in GOOG - It's google, need I say more? \n\n10% of portfolio will be in TSLA - It's Tesla. They are the future. \n\n8% of portfolio will be in METV - This is a Metaverse ETF. \n\n8% of portfolio will be in SOFI - The future of banking. Millenials and Gen Z love this company. \n\n7% of portfolio will be in TQQQ at the start of the rally, and will be swung trade every few days to make a profit. \n\n2% of portfolio will be in CCL - I see Carnival Corporation doing well long term. In fact I almost want to buy and hold some after this recent sell off a few days ago. \n\n10% of portfolio will be in cash to do swing trading.", "id": "xt9irc", "created_utc": 1664667184.0, "score": 90, "upvote_ratio": 0.76, "num_comments": 154, "comments": [{"body": "WTS- watts water.

Edge cases are where mishaps happen since it’s not trained for them.\n\nI'm not aware of any reason why edge cases should take priority over primary functionality. I appreciate they spent as much time as they did fixing \"Chuck's Turn\", but while my car still tries to pull out in front of cars, completely ignores stop signs and fails to anticipate the proper lanes for upcoming turns, I don't see why the priority is given to edge cases. Yes, that's where mishaps happen, but during the primary driving use case, there are loads of mishaps there too. So why prioritize edge cases? \n\n>Safety has always been their top priority. That’s the point of FSD, and why they get 5 star crash ratings.\n\nI'm not contesting that. I know Tesla skeptics for some reason do question the 5 star crash ratings. Hell, I have owned 3 Teslas because I know my family is safe inside them. Prioritizing safety makes sense, and is good business as well as good engineering. That doesn't change the fact that they're selling a technology they currently are demonstrating they're unable to deliver... but they still sell it.\n\n>It’s improving faster and faster.\n\nThis is where I disagree. I've had FSD purchased on a 2017 Model X and now my current 2019 Model X. I was there when Navigate on Autopilot enabled driverless lane changes, freeway exits, etc. Those were improvements. All the while, Tesla claimed FSD was simply waiting on legislation allow it, then they'd \"flip a switch\" and enable level 5 autonomy. Legislation was resolved, but then \"it's coming.\" Then from Musk himself, \"level 5 autonomy\" by EOY 2019, then again EOY 2020 (along with robotaxis). \n\nFSD beta's rollout took months longer than originally announced for limited rollout in 2021. I received FSD beta in December 2021, and it was not in any shape or form a technology that ANYONE familiar with it would claim: \"Oh yes, this is almost done, by EOY it'll be fully autonomous and functional.\" Now people get FSD beta rollouts with a lot of release notes with highly technical jargon, all probably very accurate, but it's improvements of this or that in 5%, 10%, 12%. Meanwhile, beta drivers widely see regression in the software, or consistently inconsistent performance. Automation is usually denoted by repeatable action (with some occasional failures, sure, but anything more than a few per hundred or thousand would be considered flawed) with consistent outcomes. People post videos of their successful drives with no interventions, which is great, but for every video posted, there's hundreds of FSD beta users who post in communities like this one, speaking about the failures, interventions, phantom braking, etc. \n\nImproving \"faster and faster\" implies rapid growth, possibly even exponential growth. That's not what we're seeing, but it sure is what we WANT to see. Tesla demonstrated they could rapidly build Optimus in less than a year, and yet Tesla still hasn't combined the highway and city street stacks, which Musk even complained about over a year ago.\n\nI've put my money where my mouth is; level 5 autonomy will be AMAZING. I use FSD beta and highway autopilot ALL THE TIME, for thousands of miles per year. I've seen it reach the plateau we're currently at, and FSD beta has not, in my opinion, improved at any rate since I started using it almost a year ago, let along \"faster and faster\".", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "That headline is a joke rrrrright?

Because the cost difference would be a no brainer to the very specific buyer if they were essentially the same quality utilities utilization.\n\nIt sounds like their goal is to use the same manufacturer for both robots and cars? Idk. A million of something isn't much in China when people can work up to 20 hour days... And maybe they've started introducing more robots on the manufacturing lines.\n\nOverall I'm skeptical of any useful consumer available robot that makes sense and provides real value outside of a toy for a rich person.

Especially considering the amount of R&D needed to go into this to make it a reality.  \n\nThere’s a reason Boston Dynamics isn’t mass producing robots.

I meant: I'm skeptical of him delivering projects to their full predicted realization, but not skeptical of him stating prices incorrectly as I don't recall any recent massive pricing discrepancies that are 3.75  times different between announcement and release wth Tasle.\n\n I recall a lot of failed projects of his that sounded promising at the start. In other words he could sell absolute shite for $20k, and that'd be my expectations. But I'm curious if their capabilities are equal in this robot case. Even if the Tasle one is 3. 75 worse in capabilities compared to the Boston dynamics one with the $20k to 75k price comparison, it means they are equal in value. No matter how useless both of them currently are to a consumer, that would be the case if it were so\n\nI can imagine Tesla WILL actually sell more units than Boston dynamics of their equivalent robots. They have a lot of rich fanboys, and meanwhile then the rest of us just watch their cool synchronized dance moves from a far (more likely from Boston dynamics' robot). As touched on : even for rich people $20k can be seen as a much cheaper purchase than $75k, which would be like a luxary car price versus the average car.

I'm not saying that's the final price, I just don't remember a time where they failed on the VALUE side of things compared to the original estimated price he put out. From my perspective, if they can't deliver it close to the price they originally announced  then they just drop the project completely like they usually do. With how important robots are for out future I don't think they'll drop this endeavour that easily. Their original pitch was \"what if you had a personal service robot who could carry your groceries? \", but I think they are hoping to replaces warehouse workers with these robots-make them do the peoples' grunt work. Amazon already has a lot of robots, for example, but they don't have the functionality for certain tasks, so they need human workers still. If you can automate a robot to do those human tasks, anything under $100k is a steal for factories (in Europe, North America-this is conservative as the robots could last for many more years) as that is 2-4 years of salary for an employee, if you include benefits then there are more savings to be had for any factory. \n\nYeah, it's up in the the air how much it will really cost, but I'm curious if they are simultaneously working on outfitting a factory and creating tech that can do both robot cars and robots on the same line. That in itself would be an important development. And probably actually the important invention here. If they create a factory that makes robots with robots, then it's essentially self-sufficient with just a bit of human monitoring in it. That's what I wonder is their true idea and innovation is. If that is successful we are talking about billions of easy dollars if they outfit other factories with the tech for a large sum of money. To use Amazon as a comparison, 75% of their profits are not from selling things to consumers with their commerce website you're familiar with, but from their web services like their web servers for websites. I repeat, their main business is not commerce! Their main business is owning a good chunk of the internet, just like how a company like Tesla could poise themselves to be worldwide manufacturing giants under the guise of selling cars and robots. They just need a business to show the use case, and test out their capabilities, just like how Amazon used their website to do the same thing\n\n\nAs far as the quality and value goes for a specific humanoid robot project, I have little faith in Tesla. And I think people are downvoting me because they think I'm some Tesla fanboy. I'm not one at all though.  In fact, Elon and Tesla are one of my least fave combos. I just catch them in the news with their successes and failures, and am guessing their future moves as companies like these need to be at least 5-10 years ahead of where everyone else is at. They ran Tesla at a loss for SO many years before they started turning a profit with their cars, and that's their business model. Throw lots of money at something for many years ahead of other companies, some projects suck and don't take off - it's \"only\" millions of dollars lost . But you just need one or two main projects to be successful on this scale. They even pretty much PAID to win the bid with NASA for the recent moon mission contract, and Amazon complained about this \"unfair advantage\" simply because Tesla was eager to run at a loss with the bid. They didn't do that because they wanted to lose money, they did it for their long-term goal of the first commercial company to rule space. Practice, but also, recognition. Are you going to buy a spacecraft from then in 50 years because they were the first, or from a new startup that doesn't have any practice in space yet? \n\nTesla is basically in for the long play.

The same AI \"backend\" will serve ALL Tesla development (and maybe SpaceX).  The same supercomputer will do the deep learning needed for the robot AND autonoumous driving as they have a tremendous amount in common \"processing wise\".   I will say, as a techie, the appraoch was very original. Specs are always suspect in these things but they architecture of the \"datacenter\" for AI is a leap beyond anyone currently and the performance supports that.  Mind you that hardware is proprietary and will never ship.  What is the gold is the AI \"learning\" progress itself. \n\nAs for the robot - they took the standard \"fail faster\" approach of just build it with the best ideas you have but get to something workable. This allows parallelism in development. The software guys are not waiting for the perfect hardware 24 months from now. For 6-8 months it was an exceptional effort. They also have \"simulated\" versions that allow them to testbed other approaches modularly.  In short they are doing it exactly right to move methodically forward.  They also have \"Design For Manufacturability\" (DFM) baked in so they are playing with something that will scale, using Tesla's Gigafactory existing equipment to make robots as well as cars. In fact, and this was part of the demo, they can make robots that potentially actually make cars.  (A lot of the car assembly line has industrial robots already for stamping, welding, painting and so forth so this is an evolution.)  Now pivot that to SpaceX.

But...robotics is pretty much a solved problem. Boston Dynamics showed us that the robotics is there to build a fully functional humanoid robot. I think Asimo showed us that the hand-eye coordination of robotics is also quite good.\n\nSo, the tech is there even if tesla doesn't have it yet.\n\nWhat's really missing? As far as I can tell what's missing is the software to make the hardware truly useful. However, having seen what Tesla can do with self-driving cars I think the software is a lot closer than we think it is.\n\nI think stage one would be homes that are fully set up to be robotized. Meaning that the robot will be able to manipulate specifically designed robot appliances. It will almost certainly start out as a toy but it isn't hard to see with enough training data that a robot could become more and more general purpose.\n\nI've been watching with a lot of interest what Tesla can do with self driving. Driving is a *very* difficult task to program and the stakes are extremely high if you make a mistake. So, as a company they've learned to be very disciplined about how and what they release. If you look at any recent self driving beta video and it's actually pretty impressive what the software can do on very difficult city streets. Yes, it still makes mistakes all the time but a lot of those mistakes are due to driving being an extremely dynamic enviroment that requires split second decisions every millisecond.\n\nIn the home, a robot would not be under *nearly* so demanding conditions. The robot could study a pile of clothes for whole entire minutes to decide what it is rather than having 30 milliseconds to make a life or death decision if that thing in the road, moving at a net 140 mph, is a shadow or a 30 ton tractor trailer.\n\nSo yeah, even though Tesla rolled out this derpy platform I think the future is actually pretty bright for robotics and I'm glad Tesla is in it because Elon definitely has a skill at making fantasy products real. As an aside, lots of people aren't old enough or don't read much or whatever but a fully \"no compromise\" large scale production electric car was basically considered impossible. That was especially true after the GM fiasco. The funding needed, the technical skill, the marketing prowess, etc, was all extraordinarily high in terms of getting an electric car built that didn't make a single sacrifice compared to a gas car.\n\nIn any case, here's hoping for a robotic future.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Kill all robots", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "If it can't do a back flip, it aint shit", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Happy birthday paulie", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Omg what’s wrong with it?

If you’re having to ask, you probably wouldn’t. \n\nMy investment of choice over the last six weeks has been SQQQ. I made good money on GME in a day but have made far more on SQQQ over the last six weeks. I personally don’t think the run-up on that one is over as it’s simply a 3x inverse of the NASDAQ and tech stocks still seem to have plenty of room to fall, but I did close out 75% of my position around 3:30 this afternoon. \n\nOpportunities to make money come every day, but they’re rarely single-day opportunities (those are easy to miss or end up on the wrong end of) and they take patience and temperance as opposed to chasing waves that have already broken.", "score": 28, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you for your insight", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "get in on BBBY, its shorted to shit and doesnt have many shares.

Basically... they ported over their self-driving vehicle AI and adapted it for the robot.\n\nAnd they also ran an algorithm (although I'm not sure it was AI) to model and engineer their actuators to minimize the number of unique components. I think the core bot (torso + large ligaments) only have 6 unique actuators in total.
