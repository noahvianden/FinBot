{"title": "This sub perfectly encapsulates why you can’t beat the market.", "selftext": "There’s a hell of a lot of fear running around (whether you’d like to admit it or not), and all I see on here are people abandoning those ideas that kept getting trotted out during the bull market (be greedy/blood on the streets/buy low etc). This sub is far more smug than wsb so it’s far more infuriating to see here. Let’s address the FUD:\n\n1.) ‘Don’t fight the fed’ - bullshit. Since the 1950s we have had 13 rate hike cycles - 9 of these correlated with up markets, 4 correlated with down markets. My point is not to say that this time there won’t be a correlation. My point is that NOBODY KNOWS. Link for reference:\n\nhttps://images.app.goo.gl/oVzhVPgG4Y4q2cnW6\n\n2.) I see a lot of people going ‘fear/blood isn’t here yet etc.’ - these people will never buy because they are scared. These are people who will say, ‘I’ll buy when SPY hits 300’ but if it actually does they’ll 100% go ‘I’ll buy when SPY hits 250.’ These people are scared and have always been like this. Every bear market you hear the same thing. And if you’re still not convinced? Look at the ‘fear and greed index’ - it combines multiple factors including put/call ratios and vix. Currently we are at ‘extreme fear’ with levels comparable to March 2020 and 08/09. We also see ‘extreme fear’ in essential non-events but hey that’s human nature. Link for reference:\n\nhttps://edition.cnn.com/markets/fear-and-greed\n\n3.) ‘If you invested in xxxx then it would’ve taken you x years to break even’ - this assumes that you lump summed SPY just before a crash and then never invested again. This applies to almost nobody. But even if you did - if you held, you would’ve been fine. Link for reference: \n\nhttps://awealthofcommonsense.com/2014/02/worlds-worst-market-timer/\n\n4.) All I’ve seen this last month are people essentially espousing market timing in an effort to find the bottom, or jump back in only when a bottom has been established. But what’s wrong with this? On the surface the latter sounds sensible. Again, history says otherwise. Bank of America did a study showing what your returns would look like from 1930 if you missed the best and worst days in the market. If you stayed invested since 1930, didn’t take out a penny, your returns would be 17,715%. If you missed the best 90 days (out of 21,252, so 0.43% of market days), your returns drop to 28%. That’s not per year, that’s 28% over 90 years.\nOf course, if you missed the 90 worst days you’d do the best, but here’s the kicker - 80% of the market’s best days come within 2 weeks of its worst days. I guarantee you - you can’t time that. Link for reference:\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/amp/2021/03/24/this-chart-shows-why-investors-should-never-try-to-time-the-stock-market.html\n\nSo what conclusions do we have? Buffet/Munger/Lynch all say the same thing. History says the same thing. Statistics say the same thing. \n\nIgnore the macro. Stick to DCA for indices or valuation for individual stocks. This is financial advice. \n\nLink for reference:\n\nhttps://images.app.goo.gl/fhhh29hDG5QsPfke7", "id": "xvavi3", "created_utc": 1664877276.0, "score": 1381, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 504, "comments": [{"body": "Everyone wants to buy low but when its actually lower they get scared cuz they fear it can be lower (this sub in a nutshell)", "score": 575, "replies": [{"body": "and when everything is up like crazy, people get hella bullish.

Energy always slumps toward the end of each quarter and then after the new quarter starts it generally peaks about 2 months into the quarter.

The market already has seen what happens when the Fed tries to do that. \n\nThe very high probability was that the Fed would follow through, that inflation was getting out of control, and that risk-assets would suffer as a result. This isn't ***knowing*** for sure that selling was the right move. But probabilities were clearly on that side.\n\nIt's slightly murky right now because central banks appear to maybe be in the early stages of reversal. The Fed doesn't appear to be on the cusp of reversal, but alot of hopium exists right now, because people have taken such a hit in the midst of raging inflation. If the Fed continues with doing what it said, markets have further to fall. And we just don't know until we get more data, and more Fed action or forward guidance.\n\nI think it's irresponsible to be unrepentantly risk on right here. The risks should be articulated. They are reasonable.\n\nMaking broad occasional moves (once or twice a year, or even every couple years or so), to leverage the probabilities of forward guidance and broad shifts in market are enough to beat the market.

A year ago, the number of adults who felt stretched too thin was closer to 55%.\n\nEven high-income earners are feeling the strain, the report found. Of those earning more than six figures, 45% reported living paycheck to paycheck, a jump from the previous year’s 38%. \n\n“More consumers living paycheck to paycheck indicates that many are continuing to lose their financial stability,” said Anuj Nayar, LendingClub’s financial health officer.\n\nThe consumer price index, which measures the average change in prices for consumer goods and services, rose a higher-than-expected 8.3% in August, driven by increases in food, shelter and medical care costs.\n\nAlthough real average hourly earnings also rose a seasonally adjusted 0.2% for the month, they remained down 2.8% from a year ago, which means those paychecks don’t stretch as far as they used to.\n\nA separate report by Bank of America found that 71% of workers feel their pay isn’t keeping up with the cost of living, bringing the number of people who feel financially secure to a five-year low.\n\nMany Americans are dipping into their cash reserves, and nearly half are falling deeper in debt.\n\nThose struggling to afford their day-to-day lifestyle tend to rely more on credit cards and carry a higher monthly balance, making them financially vulnerable, according to Nayar.\n\n“It is no secret that prices have been increasing for everyday Americans — not only in the goods and services they purchase but also in the interest rates they’re paying to fund their lives,” he said. “This can have detrimental consequences for someone who pays the minimum amount on their credit cards every month.”\n\nFor its part, the Federal Reserve hiked its target federal funds rate by 0.75 percentage points for the third time in a row to calm runaway inflation.\n\nThe central bank has indicated even more increases are coming until inflation shows clear signs of a pullback.\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/30/stubborn-inflation-forces-more-americans-to-live-paycheck-to-paycheck-.html\n\nIt seems consumer spending will really be getting halted sooner rather than later.

{"title": "You need to know what's going on in China.", "selftext": "# Because it's genuinely interesting.\n\nI asked a couple days ago in a thread if anyone would like to hear a brief analysis of [what’s happening with the competition in the Chinese market right now](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/xr5unp/comment/iqdjjak/?context=3), and I got mostly positive responses, so here it is. Buckle up.\n\nFirst, I need to establish what this post isn’t: I am not an investor in any company listed here. I am not taking a bull or bear position within the context of this post. I run r/chinacars for fun, and read up on what’s happening in the auto industry there every day — usually with my morning coffee — to understand how the market is changing over there, and I’m only sharing what I’ve learned for those interested in this part of the equation.\n\nI am sure you’ve also seen the kind of “chicken little” dynamic that goes on every time Chinese cars are mentioned on Reddit. A lot of eager Nio/Xpeng speculators going around saying things like “The Chinese companies are going to cream the west any minute now!”, and a lot of equally dismissive replies. I’m not attempting to further either narrative here (the truth is more complex, imo) or make a statement the potential of these companies in the European or North American markets.\n\nIn *China*, however, there is something special happening. We’re at a definite inflection point, and there’s been a shift.\n\n# What’s happening that is different?\n\nYou may have heard that China sells a lot of EV's, and that's true, but until now, the number of local models which could credibly be called direct “Tesla competitors” (particularly in counterpart to the 3/Y) was a very short list, effectively countable on one hand. Most of the larger state-owned players ([Changan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changan_Automobile), [SAIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAIC_Motor)) have been focusing on smaller cars like the BenBen EV and Wuling Mini, and most of the smaller startups have been focused on higher-end low-volume cars more akin to the Model S and Model X (Li One, Nio ES8, Nio ET7).\n\n[Beep Beep](https://preview.redd.it/ipeingqlhtr91.jpg?width=1916&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b8aa53225ae18b2172b273c6df6ee7a5deb12f13)\n\nHowever... this quarter has been the craziest flood of product launches aimed right at the heart of the 3/Y demographic that I’ve ever seen in the industry. Other China watchers have been saying the same thing, too. It has been a remarkable change, and for those of us watching, jaw-dropping in the force and ferocity of the announcements.\n\n# How crazy is it?\n\nHere, let me give you some perspective: About a year ago, the number of launched products that could *credibly* be called direct 3/Y competitors looked roughly like this:\n\n* Nio ES6/EC6\n* BYD Han\n* BYD Tang\n\nNote that by *credible* and *direct* I mean products in *roughly* the same category, from reputable brands, with a focus on connectivity and semi-premium market positioning — any product that could *conceivably* take a sale away from the 3/Y.\n\nIn the past year, these additions have started production:\n\n* Xpeng P5\n* Zeekr 001\n* Roewe Marvel R\n* GAC Aion S Plus\n* GAC Aion LX Plus\n* BYD Yuan Plus\n* BYD Song Plus\n\nIn the last *three months* alone, the following have now launched:\n\n* BYD Seal\n* Nio ET5\n* Nio ES7\n* Xpeng G9\n* Li L9\n* Li L8\n* Changan Shenlan 03\n* Changan Avatr 011\n* SAIC Rising R7\n* SAIC IM L7\n* Leap Motor C01\n* Hozon Neta S\n* Aito M5 EV\n\nAs you can see it's uh... significant. We've gone from a small handful of contenders to many times that amount in the span of a year, with more on the way.\n\n# Okay, but are they really any good? These are just a bunch of copycat designs, right?\n\nThe maturity and product fit of these products — particularly the group that has launched in the last three months — is consistently and remarkably better than anything we've seen before. On the powertrain side, most of these vehicles are on new platforms with modern packs, like CATL’s Qilin, BYD’s e-platform 3.0, or Leapmotor’s CTC 3.0. They’re delivering significant increases in power delivery, charging speeds, and range. Battery giant and Tesla supplier CATL has even gotten directly into the game themselves, co-developing two models — the Shenlan 03 and Avatr 011 with partner Changan.\n\nIt’s not just the powertrain but also the interior work that is notable, particularly the tech. All of these cars are connected vehicles with phone apps, cellular connectivity, and some level of capability to receive over-the-air updates. Huawei’s taken a particularly big leap into the industry, with their HarmonyOS infotainment system showing up on a number of vehicles, including [their own Aito M5 EV](https://youtu.be/WHyPkhlSWCM?t=239). This is a step-change in sophistication for most automakers, offering a fluid experience, app support, and much more intuitive design than before — all similar to what Tesla offers.\n\n[Huawei HarmonyOS IVI on the Avatr 011](https://preview.redd.it/ocw13uuimtr91.jpg?width=1412&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f72e53ea9e30ba3d9b05429cbe72c89141ce230b)\n\nHardware has seen a massive upgrade with almost across the board implementation of Qualcomm’s 8155P chip, a much more powerful SoC than anyone used previously. Meanwhile, Nvidia Orin chips are powering ADAS, and a number of vehicles have IPS/OLED screens, full-colour heads up displays, and Dolby Atmos audio.\n\nQuality of life features include glass roofs, leather interiors, electronically-adjustable seat bolsters, soft-closing doors, programmable interior *and* exterior LED lightning, pop-up spoilers, phone entry, and a bunch more. Check [this review of the Avatr 011](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPkMYP_xohw) to see just how far this goes.\n\nFinally, the design has taken a definite step up. These cars *look good*, with animated lighting features, flush door handles, diamond-stitched interiors, and an obvious step-up in design language consistency.\n\n[Rising R7](https://preview.redd.it/ia1tcc3tmtr91.jpg?width=2968&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0802e88e0f2954ddad5d3353ebcadcc626e72409)\n\n# What’s the pricing like?\n\nIncredibly competitive.\n\nMost of the TM3-fighters we’re talking about here start in the ¥200K ($30K) range for their basic models. The Changan Shenlan 03, for instance, will come in at ¥183,900 (\\~$27,000) for a 515 km (CLTC) range model with a 5.9s 0-60, and many of the features I listed above, including Huawei’s infotainment running on a Qualcomm 8155.\n\nOne of the most expensive of the bunch — the Li L9 — is an EREV offering six seats, a 5.5s 0-60 time, five OLED screens powered by dual Qualcomm 8155 chips, dual-sim 5G cellular connectivity, ADAS powered by dual Nvidia Orin chips, integrated LIDAR, air suspension, front-row massaging seats, a panoramic glass roof with an electric closing shade, and *a fridge in the centre console* for RMB 459,800… or roughly $65K USD. Phew.\n\n[First-class seating on the Li L9.](https://preview.redd.it/a10hr1vwmtr91.jpg?width=934&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9d3ffd6cd9006ddaeb955a48194d2c9c5d2c6bfb)\n\n# Are there some more specific examples of models to watch?\n\nHell yeah. \n\n**Nio ET5**\n\nNio’s ET5 is an interesting one in that at roughly $50K, it is positioned vaguely higher (not lower) than the Tesla Model 3, but what it offers is a compelling package for that price.. Standard features include 23-speaker Dolby Atmos audio, an AMOLED centre display, soft-close doors, pop-out handles, and customizable interior lighting. Nio’s autonomous driving package includes 4x NVIDIA Orin chips, LIDAR, RADAR, and a full suite of 360º cameras, and is expected to receive continual OTA updates as it improves, just like Tesla’s system. This is expected to be Nio's most consequential model, will likely become the volume seller for the brand.\n\nDeliveries started this week.\n\n[I like this yellow colour.](https://preview.redd.it/9ccqrjv4ntr91.jpg?width=1195&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=561d0ca17398b9e340136e3b15b7da9182fcbb04)\n\n**Xpeng G9**\n\nThe Xpeng G9 offers 800V charging, a 550HP AWD powertrain that does 0-60 in under 4s, and a chassis packed with technology including dual 15” screens, air suspension, and Xpeng’s NGP Autopilot competitor. Xpeng’s previous release, the P5, was a bit of a flop despite good reviews, and the G9 could be make-or-break for them. However, the offering is solid — this is the closest thing the Model Y has to a direct competitor at the same direct price.\n\nDeliveries start this month.\n\n[Xpeng calls the styling on the G9 a \\\\\"Robot Face\\\\\"](https://preview.redd.it/aw97kzbbntr91.jpg?width=2000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ba8d3a40d81f973862abdcf3ae0f93f3a333c32b)\n\n**BYD Seal**\n\nYou know BYD already. They’re a big deal, and the Seal is their big gun. Based on their new e-platform 3.0, it’s starting delivery now, a direct TM3 competitor that dips down to around 210K (\\~$30K). For a trim level approaching the $40K TM3 base price, you can get one with 700 km (435mi) of CLTC range and a 300hp powertrain. You won’t get many self-driving features or quality-of-life offerings like camp mode, but the interior is excellent, and the powertrain is solid. It’s believed BYD could be producing as many as 15K per month in the short term, and they could approach an annual run-rate as much as 300K in the long-term.\n\nDeliveries started last month.\n\n[The BYD Seal is waterproof enough to serve briefly as a boat, clearly. ](https://preview.redd.it/mf3u52tyntr91.jpg?width=1589&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dd59ff3a6648fdb84daed08f002f3710478cf2a5)\n\n**Zeekr 001**\n\nGeely is already approaching a 100K annual run-rate on the Zeekr 001, a car priced in line with the Tesla Model 3 but nearly the size of a Tesla Model S. It comes equipped with Qualcomm 8155P IVI, Mobileye Supervision ADAS, and the usual luxury touches mentioned on the other vehicles, but the build quality is the star of the show here, with many reviewers noting that it comes off as a true global car.\n\nThis is Geely's first car on their [SEA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_Experience_Architecture_platform) platform, which will underpin every subsequent electric car by the conglomerate including the Polestar 3, Lotus Eletre, Smart #1, and Radar RD6 — all of these coming out over the *next few months.*\n\n[If only it came in a manual.](https://preview.redd.it/u0wwjq79otr91.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=48126c1a23b8cca9870c93f57df9c3979eb29280)\n\n# Will they be made in quantity? Will they sell?\n\nIndisputably. Ramp up is already happening. Li just launched the L9 last month and has already delivered 10K units. Nio’s ET5 is being delivered from their brand-new Neopark, a factory with an annual production capacity of up to 300K, with more reportedly planned. Aion is already selling 30K units per month of their models, and growing every month. Hozon Neta isn’t far behind.\n\n[Aion is already selling close to 400K BEVs per year. ](https://preview.redd.it/kjteibnhotr91.jpg?width=1770&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=552dff8e7af6f66ca8d72e24a7b2ae6c27b81a77)\n\nCustomers have started lining up and placing preorders by the tens of thousands on these brands in a way that they never had previously. Nio’s ET5 launch [attracted crowds to their stores](https://cnevpost.com/2022/09/09/nio-et5-model-3-moment/) the moment demo models arrived.\n\n[Crowds at Nio for the launch of the ET5](https://preview.redd.it/wzgpktvvotr91.jpg?width=1261&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3a0d6e51a8f92131337e4c0918da898d06cc5fc5)\n\n# What about the financials of these companies?\n\nHear me out: Largely irrelevant at the moment. Changan (Shenlan, Avatr), SAIC (Rising, iM), and GAC (Aion) are all state-owned, and structured for long-term success. Zeekr’s parent Geely is, of course, the same company that owns Volvo, Polestar, and Lotus, already very profitable, and still growing strong.\n\nRight now, BYD is built for absurd levels of growth, and just passed a 2.2M run rate.\n\n[You can approximately halve these numbers to get the BEV figures.](https://preview.redd.it/5mjadnt1ptr91.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=342d015e066e070bc31d95141a201d80c5b71730)\n\nNio nearly bankrupted themselves a couple years back trying for extreme growth (much like Tesla in 2017) so they have some dodgy history, but they’ve seemingly crawled out of that at this point.\n\nAs long as these companies can keep doing what they’re doing, they will mostly grow.\n\n# What should I watch for in the future?\n\nSynergistic relationships are happening faster and more often, and are the trend to watch. I already mentioned how Huawei is making inroads to infotainment, providing the foundation for automakers to deliver better experiences. The next frontier is autonomy, with Huawei aiming to provide an out-of-the-box offering to the entire field of automakers in the same fashion, and Baidu, Xiaomi, and DJI making similar moves.\n\nCommoditization is happening at a rapid pace. Companies like [Midea](https://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/3167402/chinas-ev-market-top-appliances-maker-mideas-us17-billion) are throwing money into developing off-the-shelf parts like heat pumps, silicon carbide inverters, electronic door handles, and air filtration systems. For small automakers, this means quicker options to help get to market without spending time doing component development — grow now, iterate later.\n\n# What does this mean for Tesla?\n\nIt’s unknown with absolute certainty at this point. As I said before, I’m not trying to suggest the sky is falling. We haven’t seen long-term reviews of many of these models yet, nor what kind of long-term support these OEMs are going to put into iterating their designs. We’ve seen some false starts before. Tesla retains an advantage in existing scale, brand awareness, maturity, and consistency.\n\nTesla has the wiggle room to maintain sales leadership in a way that some of these brands do not. However, it can be said there’s a definite wave of credible competition forming, and what’s clear right now is that the Chinese OEMs are moving faster to adopt new features and bring down cost than the western counterparts.\n\nIt’s likely Tesla will decide to adjust pricing or incentives to compensate, as well as implement feature improvements to the lineup. I’d expect that CDM 3/Y models will see some improvements on touchpoints and interior items at the least — revised seats, better interior lighting, improved displays, and electronic pop-out door handles are all strong possibilities.\n\n[Nio's ET5 has some absolutely gorgeous cabin lighting and OLED displays.](https://preview.redd.it/j30m7gt8ptr91.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3278d9b6cbf69f14cb6fe5d91abbd865ee240c43)\n\nTesla is [now rumoured to be heading towards a price cut in China](https://cnevpost.com/2022/09/30/tesla-to-cut-model-3-y-prices-china-report/), and has been offering [extended incentives for Tesla Insurance](https://cnevpost.com/2022/10/01/tesla-extends-insurance-subsidy-offered-in-china-to-year-end/). I would consider these firm defensive moves, and they certainly have more room to continue adjusting their offerings, but things definitely just got interesting.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nChinese OEMs are responding to the market, better and faster than anyone expected. The new generation of cars from Changan, SAIC, GAC, Nio, Xpeng, Neta, and Li have better powertrains, serious technology improvements, and are packed with features that appeal to value-seeking Chinese consumers.\n\nSince I asked my original question in response to Piper Sandler’s [market share concerns](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/xr5unp/comment/iqdjjak/?context=999) statement a week ago, Tesla reported a delivery miss. For those of you ruminating on that news, this is one datapoint to consider. Chinese consumers’ attentions are now divided among many competing brands in a way that they weren’t before, and Tesla may have to start thinking about how to win that attention back.\n\n**TLDR:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/us03zxd2htr91.jpg?width=1449&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=70ed788f28ce9992584eea6c420f67a745672e28", "id": "xvlbeq", "created_utc": 1664904904.0, "score": 504, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 229, "comments": [{"body": "Thank you very much, a very interesting post!\n\nI simply want to add some perspective, total car sales in China is around **20 Million per year**.

Not sure if I missed it but I didn’t see profitability of these companies mentioned, and that’s a major factor to consider. \n\nWhile state owned companies makes that complicated or some might argue close to irrelevant, it is important to consider since Tesla currently has almost $19B in deployable cash on hand as of last quarter, growing every quarter, and it’s not tied to the economic conditions or needs of any particular problem within any country. And Apple as an example has shown that they can upend an entire industry like they did with Apple silicon, which basically re-lit the smothered fire under the GPU market and forced everyone to catch up. Apple leads and shapes the consumer electronic market whether people are willing and able to admit it or not, just like I believe Tesla currently is and will into the future. And a big part of that power comes from profitability. \n\nNot to say that competition in the market isn’t something to be concerned about, but things like trim, pricing, specs, those can all be adjusted if need be within a quarter or maybe two to keep up with the competition. But things like the 4680 structural battery, gigapresses, and autonomy, those take much, much longer for the competition to catch up on, require huge capital investment and infrastructure, and the benefits of those compound into the future, both in the potential for the cars, supply chain, or anything else in the business.\n\nChinese companies definitely do more of that long term planning like you mentioned, especially compared to other American or European companies, but imo the profitability aspect is vital to any analysis, yet is also inherently nearly impossible to quantify because it is unknown what exactly it will lead to.

Previous McKinsey research highlighted that consumers are not always aware of which brands are foreign or domestic, and there is increasing ambiguity between the country of origin and the country of manufacture. Many Chinese consumers are so used to seeing global brands such as Olay and Biore that they may actually believe they are local. Some Chinese brands that have packaged themselves as “international” are often mistaken as foreign. Beingmate (a Chinese infant milk powder) was assumed to be a foreign brand by 45 percent of respondents.\"***\n\nRemember, what i'm specifically asking is if there's any evidence that the upper class consumers who previously were buying luxury goods from \"prestigious\" western brands (like LVMH handbags and BMWs) are now instead choosing to buy Luxury handbags from a Chinese brand, or luxury autos from a Chinese brand. And while the report does state that Chinese brands have secured a 6% market share in premium autos it also states ***\"Chinese premium automotive brands were essentially nonexistent just five years ago\"***. So it's not surprise they've gained share, Chinese consumers didn't have any option until recently. It also wouldn't surprise me to learn that the 6% of premium Chinese autos sold are EVs (noty sure if that's the case, but wouldn't surprise me).

It's happening.\n\n**EDIT:** $TWTR resumed trading. Up 15%.

The stock was halted after the report.\n\nMusk agreed to the deal earlier this year, valuing Twitter at $44 billion, but he quickly changed course and tried to back out of the agreement. Twitter sued Musk to force him to go through with the purchase. The two sides were scheduled to go to court on Oct. 17.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, which cited people with knowledge of the matter, Musk made his latest proposal in a letter to Twitter. Other media have independently confirmed Musk’s renewed offer.\n\n**EDIT 3:**  Letter Was Filed Confidentially With Court Ahead of Emergency Hearing Tuesday, Source Says -- WSJ\n\n**EDIT 4:** [From WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-proposes-closing-twitter-deal-on-original-terms-11664901454?mod=hp_lead_pos1)\n\n\"The billionaire’s lawyers communicated the proposal to Twitter’s lawyers overnight Monday and filed a letter confidentially with the Delaware Chancery Court ahead of an emergency hearing on the matter scheduled for Tuesday, the person said.\n\nIf Twitter accepts the proposal, the two sides wouldn’t have to follow through on a five-day nonjury trial set to begin Oct. 17. There are no guarantees they will reach a deal and the trial could still go forward as planned.\n\nMr. Musk was set to be deposed later this week as part of the preparations for the trial.\"", "id": "xvj3yh", "created_utc": 1664899816.0, "score": 1323, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 590, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|just now\n**Total Comments**|0|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|8 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=xvj3yh)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=xvj3yh)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "stock 15% up in the last 20 minutes lmao", "score": 462, "replies": [{"body": "Who had calls?

He believes that the Russian front in the Donbas is still in danger of imminent collapse. If this were to happen, Putin would need to escalate even further. This could take the form of more attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure, but, if the goal is to stop Ukrainian advances, a likelier option would be a small tactical nuclear strike. Slantchev suggests that it would be under one kiloton—that is, about fifteen times smaller than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima. It would nonetheless be devastating, and would almost certainly lead to an intense reaction from the West. Slantchev does not think that nato would respond with nuclear strikes of its own, but it could, for example, destroy the Russian Black Sea Fleet. This could lead to yet another round of escalation. In such a situation, the West may be tempted, finally, to retreat. Slantchev urged them not to. “This is it now,” he wrote. “This is for all the marbles.”\n\n“In this situation, the secret weapon is nuclear. And its use carries with it the risk, again, of even greater involvement in the war by the U.S. But it could also, at least temporarily, halt the advance of the Ukrainian Army. If used effectively, it could even bring about a victory. “People get very excited about the front collapsing,” Goemans said. “But for me it’s, like, ‘Ah-h-h!’ ” At that point, Putin would really be trapped.”", "score": -3, "replies": [{"body": "Oh my God!
