{"title": "Covered calls seems too good to be true", "selftext": "Hi all! I was thinking about covered calls, and developed a plan to profit from a long-term hold on some of my favorite ETFs like SPY and QQQ. I like the covered call idea because I would hold these ETFs long-term even if they dropped significantly in price because I believe they have potential for long-term growth. Right now is a good time to buy because they have already been beaten down \\~25% from inflation concerns.\n\nExample of my plan:\n\n# 1.) Buy 100 shares:\n\nPurchase 100 shares of SPY, for example at $375.50 = $37,550\n\nAgain, this would also be considered a long-term hold, but with covered calls I can play options put money to work for me.\n\n# 2.) Sell Covered Calls:  \n\nOptions for SPY are being sold every **2 business days**. Therefore, I can sell covered calls every 2 days. According to Robinhood, for example, if I sell at strike price $376 I can collect $176 in premium today. From here, the stock can either go up or down:\n\n***\\*Stock goes up:*** I sell at strike price 376, make \\~$50 profit (0.50 x100), then rebuy 100 shares of SPY, and make another call in 2 business days. Total gain is $226 in 2 days, or 0.6%\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***\\*Stock goes down:*** I keep the premium, make $176, and just hold the stock because long-term I believe in it. I keep selling premium every 2 days. Total gain is $176 in 2 days, or 0.46%. Again, I don't have much concern if the stock goes down if it's a long-term hold. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 3.)

The only people left are management and a few people to hand out samples.... Word gets out on the street that X company doesn't pay their employees.. then who is going to want to work there??  My friend works at Microsoft and every time I see him, he tells me how he loves working there, they challenge him, UNREAL pay and benefits, and as a result it's a very collaborative environment. \n\nExample:  I started at this company a few years back. They also hired 3 other people at the same time. I noticed an interesting trend... all 3 employees left within 6 months of working there. I couldn't figure out why and then I looked at their resumes and realized they had all been hired into roles they were overqualified for (and I'm guessing paid below market). I stuck it out for a few years since I liked the job, but recently it's been an absolute PITA to get my job done. I've suggested the changes that need to be made, and that comp needs to increase, and it continues to fall on deaf ears.

HR needs a fucking wake up call, do they not realize Boston is one of the most expensive cities in the country? Their surveys are SHIT and filled with bias. Who pays for the survey HR?!?\n\nI'm a top performer and have been every year and have the credentials and network to back that up.

Our family stayed in a motorhome in line for two weeks to purchase a house in a new tract in Orange County. My parents rate was 16%! (the house was 105K). They did fine.\n\nMy wife and I thought we were buying at the top of the market in 1998. It was a sellers market, rates were in the 8's. We were out-bid multiple times before we just desperately pulled the trigger on a 255K house in Clairemont neighborhood in San Diego ( with 27K down and an \"80-10-10\" loan. Our friends had purchased around the corner two years prior for 170K.  We thought we were destined to live there forever, never make any money, etc. The one bright spot was that our rate locked on the day it dipped below 8% and we thought we were geniuses for snagging a 7 7/8 rate. \n\nFast forward two years, rates dropped, we refi'd and pulled 100K out for a major remodel and our monthly still went down.. instead, we plunked that 100k down on an ocean view house in La Jolla for the insane amount to us at the time of 680K. we hadn't even sold our house so we were carrying two mortgages. Again, scared to death we were over-extending ourselves and the whole \"house of cards\" would leave us back in apartment land forever. \n\nWhen we sold the first house for 449K we had enough left over to put 45K down on a 450K rental property, This time we had a COFI loan, which was a negative amortization loan that our shady mortgage guy sold us on. again, another anxiety inducing \"what are we doing?\" decision. Prices rose, then dropped and we thought \"we should have sold at the \"top\". but a few years later, rates dropped again, prices increased and we pulled out more, refi'd and bought another rental property. fast forward ten years, we bought the house next door for what we thought was freaking crazy money, 828K. (2006). right as the market was crashing hard...We had low (5.25) adjustable loans on everything and rates were going back up towards mid 6%. I had so many sleepless nights absolutely freaking about the possibility that rates go back to 7-8% by the time they re-set. when that time came, my rates, which were pegged to Cost of Funds Index+2points, went down.. \n\nBasically, what I'm trying to say is, we never waited for prices to come down or rates to drop before we bought.  As we both were scratching our way into middle class W-2 employees, the mortgage interest deduction is the only tax break the govt has for us. If you're in the 30% tax bracket (we weren't yet), there's a saying that \"the Govt. pays a third of your mortgage\" in adjusted gross income reductions. \n\nAfter losing deals trying to low-ball and realizing we lost a house for the equivalent of a dollar a day difference in the mortgage payment, we pretty much paid asking to get the contract then negotiated for concessions when there were any egregious defects in the home inspection. We bought high, mortgaged high and held on. Now, 20 years of rising ( and falling, but overall rising more than we imagined possible) property values we look like absolute geniuses. And we are not. We have no 401K's, we never worked for tech, no stock options etc. We would never, ever have been able to save or invest our way into the amount of equity we have with our real estate.

I still own the same amount of shares, and I'm fairly confident they'll rebound in my investment time frame. Cash just can't do that unless there's deflation, which is highly unlikely. Without those stupid investments I would be down less than 10%, but overall up maybe 10-15% at a guess from a quick look at some of my portfolio. Also, you're suggesting that timing the market is feasible, which it pretty much isn't (unless it's your full time job, or your don't have a life, and even then...). You do whatever makes you happy.

The only people left are management and a few people to hand out samples.... Word gets out on the street that X company doesn't pay their employees.. then who is going to want to work there??  My friend works at Microsoft and every time I see him, he tells me how he loves working there, they challenge him, UNREAL pay and benefits, and as a result it's a very collaborative environment.   \nExample:  I started at this company a few years back. They also hired 3 other people at the same time. I noticed an interesting trend... all 3 employees left within 6 months of working there. I couldn't figure out why and then I looked at their resumes and realized they had all been hired into roles they were overqualified for (and I'm guessing paid below market). I stuck it out for a few years since I liked the job, but recently it's been an absolute PITA to get my job done. I've suggested the changes that need to be made, and that comp needs to increase, and it continues to fall on deaf ears. So I decided to field some calls and network over the past few months (I don't use Linkedin because they track it) and I received an offer on Friday and have a final round interview at another company this week. Both of which are 2 levels up and I was amazed to see how far below market I was being paid ($150K in base comp alone, not to mention the equity awards and sign-on bonus being MUCH better).   \nI thought I was handcuffed by the awards my current company gave me but both companies are willing to cover almost half of my unvested stock. I'd gladly take 50 cents on the dollar today vs. waiting another 4 years for my shares to vest! After discounting that $ back and getting smoked by taxes (my existing awards are recognized as income, so I can't even recognize it as a cap gain). Not to mention, who the hell knows where we'll be in 4 years.   \nWhat's even worse, I just had a child and received my first daycare bill last week since they want 1st month in advance. It was $4,000!!! It's $200/day for daycare that's $48K per year! That's more than my fucking mortgage.

HR needs a fucking wake up call, do they not realize Boston is one of the most expensive cities in the country? Their surveys are SHIT and filled with bias.

If there is a pile of sugar nearby more foragers will send signals and an exponential growth of foragers will occur until there is sufficient labor to bring the food resource into the colony.\n\nIf however, there is an anteater lurking outside foragers will not return to give pheromone signals, foragers will not be created, and the greater colony is protected. This is a self correcting feedback loop that allows a disorganized group to grow and thrive in the most efficient manner possible.\n\nOf course our human Civilization is so much more complex, and we like to feel our rational decision making processes guide our behavior, but marketing research has shown us that our behavior is governed by external queues much more than we think.\n\nJust like the ants, there is not an organization overseeing the control of our behavior which creates social stratification, the funneling of wealth to the top, control over the masses, or even our death spiral toward unhealthy lifestyles and global destruction.

I do not fundamentally disagree with any of your points, only on the the position there is some sort of leader of some ill defined cabal conspiring to hold people down.

The vaccine is given by intramuscular injection.\n \n^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&message=OptOut&subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)", "score": 4, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "Okay how much are pfizer selling them to Americans, what’s the price per shot?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "According to the article, they cost less then $2 to manufacture and they plan on selling them for $130 now vs. the $30/dose price the government was buying them at", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "This is how cable is responding to people cutting the cord.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "R&D must mean take a dump in a vial and send it.", "score": 0, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "No they wouldn’t. \n\nPeople who are dying will pay literally any price for medication.\n\nPharma is pretty well known to be price-inelastic", "score": 85, "replies": [{"body": "Pay $1000 for a drug that cost $1 to make, or die.

We were flying standby the whole time, and what we did was buy flights well in advance because they were cheaper, and then go to the ticketing booth in the airport and ask them to transfer those to current flights, and that was waaay cheaper than buying the flights on the day, because it was looking like $8,000 for the two of us. Instead it ended up costing us $525 total.\n\nWe were the last two people to board on the very last flight out of this tiny town before they shut down the airport indefinitely, otherwise we were looking at either Airbnb in a tiny little suite with only 30 minutes of outdoor exposure every second day (prison like lockdowns), or spend $500 each to take a van taxi 24 hours overland to Buenos Aires. Argentina is a huge country and that’s a long drive.\n\nCamping out in the airport we had built a little fort out of luggage carts and our backpacks. We took out every layer of clothing we could to soften the ground, and my gf flies with a travel pillow, so we took turns using it. Looking up at the bright airport lights, you just kinda wished you could fucking turn them off for an hour. But they were always on. Food was very scarce and low grade, and kind of unreasonably priced for what you got. \n\nThen when we got to Cancun, walking through the absolutely packed, chaotic airport, there was a guy, leaning against the post, head in his hands, sunburnt to hell, and he just looked really rough, and at that point it finally hit me, this intense feeling of despair. Imagine being stuck in Cancun and they run out of clean drinking water? Panic kind of set in. We were supposed to stay in Cancun overnight to take care of some logistics, but decided to bounce as soon as possible. Luckily, every time we transferred our flight tickets, all the staff was super helpful, friendly, and didn’t charge us. \n\nSo we got out of the airport and went straight to the grocery store to get something other than packaged food like potato chips, and we walked right past a van taxi, one of the guys got out of the van right as we walked by and literally coughed all over us. Smdh.\n\nWhen we got back to the airport I was starting to get agitated because people don’t typically give you much space there, especially if you’re a gringo, and perceivably worth a couple bucks more than the locals would pay, so they get on you. But the airport lounge helped us chill a bit. \n\nOverall it just felt like running a gauntlet. But when we got to Miami, everyone was way too lax there, and lots of the staff members were all joking around, by doing things like spray disinfectant all over themselves as if they were having a shower. One of the border patrol agents just had a helpless approach to things, like he knew what was happening everywhere, but just thought, what could he even do? He still has to go to work and deal with 1000’s of international travellers.\n\nIt was only when we got to LA where things got a lot more serious about wearing masks, filling out forms, etc.\n\nFinally after flying to Seattle, and then Vancouver BC, getting home and laying on my bed, I noticed I had a strong fever again. I guess all the stress and dealing with so many nasty people, like people that pick their nose in public and touching everything, I think my immune system needed to kick back into high gear.\n\nNice thing was that my daughter bought us some groceries for when we returned home, so we were able to isolate fairly easily.\n\nHope that wasn’t too boring to read, but if you were there, it would feel really messed up. There was a genuine feeling of despair everywhere you went. Lots of shops were all closed. People were scared, etc. Overall 1/10. Do not recommend.

{"title": "Apple Earnings (AAPL): A Sensible Discussion", "selftext": "Sup Ladies and Gentleman, and all you other degenerates.  I would like to discuss the event that is this Thursday: Apple Earnings.  I know nothing about the company products really which is why I've tagged it a discussion.  I am not some neckbeard fanboy who has such a poor understanding of technology, he has to get a baby proofed computer with an outrageous monitor stand,  nor am I a yuppie wanna-be artist with my head stuck up my ass sitting at a coffee shop waiting for someone to compliment the apple logo on my devices and clothes.  Personally, I am bearish.  Personally, I am an idiot.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# TL;DR\n\nI'm going to live up to my username and put the TL;DR in the beginning for you because I sense your concentration already drifting:\n\n1. AAPL is important because it is a Colossus (get it?) of the Tech industry.  It will influence other holdings, and we should discuss and prepare.\n2. AAPL has held up remarkably through this crash.  Tim Apple is lending out his Apple-Bottom to all of Wall Street is my guess.  **This means Apple has a lot of room to fall like a final sacrifice to the bear God.**\n3. Chip problems from China.  Biden administration is forcing a brain drain out of China and manufactured chips and production are in big fucking trouble.\n4. Stagnant growth and peaked design.  This is gonna upset people, but there really is so many times you can resize a box for a pocket and call it a fresh new product.  The hardware is getting ever so faster, but the innovation is gone.\n5. Flood of existing pre-used products already on the market.\n6. American population is cutting back on expenses, and apple products are so overpriced for what they do.\n7. (Hoping to add more as good points come in)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# 1.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[See Biggest Square](https://preview.redd.it/5y2tsbc7mlv91.png?width=1354&format=png&auto=webp&s=503fc2604fa460ae6af4d47b04f88ee261dd24c9)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 2. Apple Still Hasn't Fallen Off the Tree\n\nOn my 1Y chart on Robinhood it says:\n\n* Apple down 1.41%\n* Microsoft down 21.94%\n* SPY down 17.13%\n* Amazon down 29.93%\n* Google down 27.26%\n* Snapchat down 86.93%\n* Bitcoyne down 67.9%\n* Silver down 21.16%\n* My portfolio down 69.69%\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere is some historical reference going all the way back pre-covid:\n\n|Announcement Date|Fiscal Quarter End|Estimated EPS|Actual EPS|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|10/27/2022||$1.25|$????|\n|2022-07-28|2022-06-30|$1.14|$1.20|\n|2022-04-28|2022-03-31|$1.43|$1.52|\n|2022-01-27|2021-12-31|$1.89|$2.10|\n|2021-10-28|2021-09-30|$1.24|$1.24|\n|2021-07-27|2021-06-30|$1.00|$1.30|\n|2021-04-28|2021-03-31|$1.00|$1.40|\n|2021-01-27|2020-12-31|$1.41|$1.68|\n|2020-10-29|2020-09-30|$0.69|$0.73|\n|2020-07-30|2020-06-30|$0.51|$0.65|\n|2020-04-30|2020-03-31|$0.52|$0.64|\n\nYou see, even despite a pandemic, they have always beat or matched their price target.  Covid was a strain on the market because of the forward thinking schizophrenic hive-mind that is traders.  They foresaw massive supply chain disruption and it is definitely here.  It is miraculous that we haven't seen more problems arising from Apple yet.  The new iPhone was announced as being delayed and stock quickly dropped and recovered.  Could this be signs of something yet to come?  Supply-chains are slow to rebuild.  Remember that.  It's been years, and the effects are being felt still.  Which brings me to my next point.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 3. Chips\n\nNot sure what computers have to do with potatoes, but we are dealing with a bag of Lays right now.  You know how you buy a bag in line at the store, and then you open it and there is like 6 chips and air?  We are in a chip shortage and it is affecting everything.  I'll leave most of this discussion to the comments because the severity of what is going on needs to be mulled over. I can't help but think this is catastrophic.  Someone correct me. Please.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 4, 5, and 6.\n\nThe remainder of my points are basically general recession points and Apple really isn't in a great place for a downturn. They sell unaffordable shiny and chrome items as a forefront of technological advancement, and people chase that clout with a fervor of excitement and pay a premium for it.  Well, buying new tech is a hobby. An expensive one.  As the strain tightens, the products already in circulation will be bought and replaced with other products as the collectors dump their phones into the market.  Similar to NVidias video cards when mining with GPU's was made obsolete.
