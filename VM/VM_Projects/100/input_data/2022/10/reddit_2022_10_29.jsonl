{"title": "Twitter will be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange on November 8", "selftext": " \n\nTwitter's stock will be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange on November 8, according to a new filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. This comes a day after Elon Musk completed [the company's takeover after a lengthy ordeal](https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/27/elon-musk-bought-twitter/) late Thursday. Incidentally, the delisting is taking place on the same date as the U.S. midterm elections.\n\n\"The New York Stock Exchange hereby notifies the SEC of its intention to remove the entire class of the stated securities from listing and registration on the Exchange at the opening of business on November 08, 2022, pursuant to the provisions of Rule 12d2-2 (a),\" the [filing reads](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/876661/000087666122000890/0000876661-22-000890.txt).\n\nIt also indicated that [the merger](https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/27/elon-musk-bought-twitter/) between Twitter and Musk's subsidiary X Holdings II, Inc. was complete. Musk's X Holdings I, Inc. will now own all the stock of the social network.\n\n\"The merger between Twitter, Inc. and X Holdings II, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of X Holdings I, Inc., wholly owned by Elon R. Musk became effective on October 27, 2022. Each share of Twitter, Inc. Common Stock was exchanged for USD 54.20 in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes. The Exchange also notifies the Securities and Exchange Commission that as a result of the above-indicated conditions this security was suspended from trading before market open on October 28, 2022.\"\n\nAt the time of writing, Twitter's stock was trading at $53.70 ‚Äî slightly lower than Musk's buying price of $54.20. Twitter won't have to make quarterly disclosures like its monthly active users or its earnings as a private company. But financial institutions that have lent money to Musk will pressure the billionaire to make the company profitable.\n\nThe social media company will likely form a new board after the current members will dissolve. Musk will have to also pick a new executive team, as one of his first steps after taking over was to [fire CEO Parag Agrawal, CFO Ned Segal, general counsel Sean Edgett and head of legal policy, trust and safety Vijaya Gadde](https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/27/elon-musk-fired-top-twitter-execs-including-ceo-reports-say/). Musk is [likely to assume the CEO position](https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/28/elon-musk-will-reportedly-take-the-ceo-role-after-exec-exodus/) for the time being, but he might hand it over to someone else in the long run.\n\nA report from [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-28/twitter-s-twtr-top-bosses-poised-to-exit-with-100-million-as-musk-takes-over) noted that Agrawal is set to receive nearly $50 million while Segal and Gadde will get $37 million and $17 million each as part of the severance package.\n\nWhile the Tesla CEO squashed rumors [of him firing 75% of Twitter's staff](https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/26/now-elon-musk-says-he-wont-fire-75-of-twitters-staff/), the current set of employees are still [preparing for a massive layoff spree](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2022-10-27/twitter-employees-brace-for-massive-layoffs-as-elon-musk-completes-his-acquisition).", "id": "yg7bv9", "created_utc": 1667009758.0, "score": 1993, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 296, "comments": [{"body": "Elon should hire a wild card like me into the ceo position and really make everyone not know what to expect", "score": 494, "replies": [{"body": "Or an even wilder card like me", "score": 93, "replies": [{"body": "***I CUT THE BRAKES!

I will however go through the other 3 pictures to explain the current situation\n\n[Meta analysis 1](https://imgur.com/CRnf0I4)\n\nMeta revenue came in -4.5% lower than the sept 2021 same quarter. As you can see, in 2021, for every 1 dollar of revenue, 64 cents was going to costs. In 2022, for every 1 dollar of revenue, 80 cents is going to cost. We're seeing a 45.66% decline in operating income. Also they are paying 21.18% in taxes which we will use later in our picture 4 calculation.\n\n[Meta analysis 2](https://imgur.com/Qk325WQ)\n\nIn the 2021 quarter, eps came in at 3.22 and in the 2022 quarter, eps came in at 1.64. That is essentially a 49% drop. If we're looking at diluted shares outstanding, the number declined by 6% meaning they are outpacing stock based compensation with their buyback program. Their total share based comp expense has increased 31.74% which is understandable given they are growing a new revenue segment\n\n[Meta Analysis 3](https://imgur.com/IUKfISN)\n\nThe information here shows the revenue segments and as we can see, from the 2021 quarter to the 2022 quarter, reality labs revenue dropped by 48.92% and the family of apps revenue dropped by 3.6%. Given that reality labs is the segment they are pouring money into, this is highly unwelcoming news. This quarters loss on the reality labs segment also came in significantly higher and compared to 2021 quarter, was 39.57% higher.\n\n[Meta Analysis 4](https://imgur.com/GAb3pG9)\n\nNow if we remove reality labs, EPS would come in around 2.71 versus the 1.64 we got.  That is a 65.24% increase on EPS. Keep in mind that there are shared expenses and getting rid of a segment may not be as oversimplified as I have shown here.\n\nHope you enjoyed the post and would love to hear any additional insight.", "id": "yg8mye", "created_utc": 1667013763.0, "score": 75, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 109, "comments": [{"body": "Microsoft integrated O365 to Metas horizon workrooms.

And ff the Fed is doing 75 basis points every meeting, this could even lead to a massive overshoot. \n\nAs for current inflation data, it might be premature to say inflation has peaked. But there is some reason to think it may have. Monthly numbers here can be very volatile. But if you look at quarterly data:\n\n1. By the most commonly used CPI measure, that for [All Urban Consumers](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=Vpkv), inflation peaked at 10.5% in Q2, and fell to **5.7%** in Q3.\n\n2. The Fed would pay more attention to the measure of this which [excludes Food and Energy](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=VpkV), which peaked in 2021 at 7.8%, but also fell slightly from 6.6% in Q2 2022 to **6.4%** in Q3 2022.\n\n3. The [16% Trimmed Mean CPI](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=Vppx) is a measure which excludes the 8% of prices with the largest one month change, and the 8% with the lowest one month change. That peaked at 8.4% in Q2, and fell to **6.7%** in Q3. \n\n4. [PCE inflation](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=Vpnp) meanwhile fell from 7.5% in Q1, to 7.3% in Q2, to **4.2%** in Q3. \n\n5. The [Core PCE](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=VpnX) measure, excluding food and energy, as with CPI, peaked in 2021. Then in 2022 fell from 5.6% Q1, to 4.7% Q2, to **4.5%** Q3.\n\n6. While [Trimmed Mean PCE](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=VpnZ), as with Trimmed Mean CPI, peaked in Q2. And fell from 5.3% Q2 to **4.7%** Q3. \n\nSo yes, all of these are still elevated; with CPI measures ~ 6.5% and PCE measures ~ 4.5%, they would still likely want another ~ 250 basis point drop. But their [own projections](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20220921.pdf) from September are anticipating a terminal Fed Funds rate in 2023 of 4.6%, only 20 basis points above their 4.4% projection for the end of 2022.

It's not just VR like everyone would have you believe. I to was curious what this money is actually going towards and what tangible results were they were even getting if any from this huge spend. Which led me to [this video](https://youtu.be/gUARgocC5FU) with hands on demos for the tech. And it actually completely reversed my negative view of the CapEx. This doesn't seem like a big nothing burger at all like I'm led to believe by the masses or news. I'm not interested in VR, but hands free controllers, augmented reality, spatial audio... This is stuff that I can 100% see the practical use in and even using myself.\n\n**2.5.** the $9 billion spend isn't all on reality labs either. As they mentioned in their earnings call and their earnings report if you actually bothered to read or listen. Most if not all of that growth is from investing heavily in A.I infrastructure and data centers to improve their core products. They even pointed to an improvement of over 30% higher return on advertising spend for advertisers in their limited testing. Hence why they now plan to invest heavily in rolling it out. And as mentioned the amount they plan to spend next year will depend heavily on the ROI. So it may and likely will be scaled back from the $100 billion initially forecasted. If not then chances are it's leading to significant revenue growth, which I fail to see the problem with...\n\n**3.** What they are doing is arguably many times more complicated than, taking a computer and fitting it into a handheld device...\n\nIt's become very obvious to me that Meta has become the victim of negative sentiment from both investors and the public. No matter what they seem to do they are completely blasted for doing it. \n\nIf they pulled back CapEx investors, would complain once the money begins to slow down from their core platforms. And that they are not doing enough to drive growth. So they increase CapEx into new innovative tech like what they are doing with reality labs. The narrative becomes it's a waste of money with no immediate pay off and they should be putting it into their core products. Because all people see is billions going in and only horizon worlds coming out. If you actually bother to look beyond the surface level it's obvious it goes much deeper than it's portrayed and requires a much longer time horizon. But sure ok invest in their core products, so they do that. Now the stock tanks because the free cash flow disappears, due to the heavy investment required to innovate on their absolutely huge core platforms. Despite the money been used on tangible assets with more clear payoffs. So it seems no matter what they do everyone is unhappy... \n\nI mean if you don't like the stock sell it, no one is forcing you to hold it. I myself have been grappling with this dilemma this past few days. So I decided to actually look hard into the company and ignore whatever everyone else is saying. And honestly after actually looking into the fundamentals myself. I've come to the conclusion I don't think I will, in fact I maybe even double down. There's some risks here sure, but if investing in companies was risk free we wouldn't need to buy bonds. What I see is real potential here with serious pay off if it works. I also see a company that if it doesn't, it has a strong enough base to easily recover and try something else. Microsoft started with an OS, Apple with Computers, Amazon with books, Google with a search engine, all branched out and are much more diverse companies today. I see Meta is also attempting the same here and believe they are in a position to follow the same path. Whether it will be VR/AR or something else, I believe they will find it eventually. I initially bought into Meta for the valuation, I now plan on staying for the future.\n\n**Side note:** if the Metaverse is so doomed and a big nothing burger.

You still think Meta is just building a literal Meta verse. This is all buzzwords and bad marketing that has led to a massive misconception about what is actually going on here. Just look at the tech and it speaks for itself. Even the new Quest Pro is actually pretty cool. Beyond a week ago I had no interest in VR, after watching some actual hands on demos (not by Meta) I'm actually pretty excited for where this goes. \n\nThe fact you can use the Quest Pro to project 3 screens in AR from say a single laptop is so cool. That one thing alone is enough to sell me on it immediately. Not because that's all I care about, but because that is just the tip of the iceberg of potential that lies underneath. Where it goes from here can only get better and that's already a pretty awesome feature. And that's nothing to do with the Metaverse, it's just practical. Especially if you are working on something and you don't want everyone who can look over your shoulder to see. Or your unable to carry three whole monitors with you wherever you go. \n\nThe VR/AR play has some real value and utility here, the biggest problem is the optics and the bad PR. There's a lot of irrational hate thrown at Meta, not because there isn't good reason, but because everyone seems to think they are the ones who participate in any of this kinds of behavior. Like companies such as Google aren't collecting and cataloging every single one of your searches, or browsing history, phone usage, etc. And it's just Meta who are overwhelming invasive. I honestly put it down to Mark Zuckerbergs unreliability, he's just not very well liked and that ends up creating a super negative image of the company as well. Google, Microsoft and Apple do a much better job of selling themselves.\n\n>Bad example, hydrogen cars are not a thing and won't be, there is endless bullshit nobody piled on because they were never something to pile on to begin with.\n\n[Hydrogen cars are very much a thing](https://www.toyota.com/mirai/)... The problem is it requires a lot of investment in infrastructure in-order to work.\n\n>If you do research and dig into what are all these companies eyeing at, its not VR/AR, its gaming itself.\n\nThis just tells me how limited you understanding of the whole thing is. The fact you still think this is about gaming. I mean it makes sense since you think it's all about the Metaverse still as well.\n\n>What Facebook is doing seems a bit insane, interesting to watch at least, non software, non hardware company pushing all in on virtual comedy clubs and meetings.\n\nNon-software company... Huh? What do you think software companies are...? They are about as software as it gets and now they are turning into a hardware company as well. Just like Microsofts jump into consoles back when it was pretty much just software. Also worked out pretty well for them.\n\n>Sure we have people dreaming about all of the future fitting into glasses replacing mobile phones\n\n*Sigh* it's not about replacing but enhancing. Just like phones didn't necessarily replace computers but enhanced our overall efficiency. VR/AR headsets and glasses will do the same, but phones will still exist.\n\n>but realistically looking it doesn't require a little bit more tech, it requires magnitudes of scientific advancements which is just insane and i would never bet Facebook to achieve it.\n\nThey literally just demonstrated an already useful successful feature with the Quest Pro. I would happily buy one for the AR screens and I can see how many work places would benefit from it as well. Some of the tech is still away off, but there's also quite a bit that is just around the corner if not already here.\n\n>People also think Apple with their ecosystem are going to pivot into space and chew Meta out, i am betting more on Microsoft prevailing.\n\nSo you accept it's not a futile meaningless effort attempting VR/AR then? This is the contradictory nature of people who make arguments against Meta taking this route. It's both a waste of money and pointless venture creating something nobody wants, but also Apple and Microsoft are doing it and it's going to be great...? Which is it? Is the Metaverse worth while or a waste of money?\n\nWhat I see is people like the stuff, but hate the company. And that comes from that image problem I mentioned earlier. Which is confusing considering neither Microsoft, Google, or Apple are any better or have your interests at heart. I mean Apple literally walls off their products and pretty much forces you to only use the things they create so they can milk you for more money. There's a reason they're so profitable with only a fraction of market share. \n\nApple: Want a universal charger? Get fucked! Also pay an extra $30 for it.\n\nWhich is exactly why I have never have and never will buy an Apple product. The company sucks, good products just hate the profit maximizing tactics that reduce user utility. Also remember that time they slowly killed everyone's phone battery so they would upgrade sooner, yeah...\n\n>Also VR has been a thing for 30 years.\n\nI hear this a lot, but I don't think everyone understands that not really. VR has been attempted, I remember Google Glass, but Moore's law is a thing and prevents it from actually succeeding for a long time.

Outside of your echo chamber most of the world has no clue about it.\n\n>Even the kids think Facebook is for the boomers now.\n\nThis is not an argument, this is conjecture based on anecdotal evidence. The data shows clearly Facebook, is still has a strong active user base. It also isn't their only platform. WhatsApp is also seeing strong growth and is still in its infancy with regards to monetization. Instagram is still very much a relevant platform. Messenger is also widely used and completely replaced texting in many instances.The fact they have a wider array of demographics is actually a positive as I see it. It means they can advertise to a wider range of people and not just one demographic. This means advertisers can reach their target demographic easier. \n\nI also use to use Facebook a lot growing up, now not so much although I still use messenger often. But my mum loves it so do her friends, she never use to get social media but now it's the only way she messages me. She doesn't even have a mobile phone but she has Facebook... let that sink in.

Meta has also essentially replicated their platform and integrated on top of their existing platforms. This is more convenient because you don't have to move to an entirely new platform to enjoy the experience, or run them simultaneously. This also highlights how hard it is for competition to displace Meta as they can easily copy and replicate their platform and serve it immediately to their almost 3 billion users.

The only people yet to join their platform are the ones who don't have easy access to internet, were recently born, and those from the older generation didn't cought up in it initially.

There's limits to growth and beyond providing free widespread internet access to most of the developing world, it's hard to get much bigger from here. \n\nI don't expect the newest generations to jump on to it, but it's good to see they are capturing demographics all the way up to 65.

Yet you've said nothing about Instagram or Whatsapp, which speaks volumes to your bias. This is because the picture isn't as grim as you would like it to be with their other platforms. For example [just over 62% of Instagrams users](https://www.omnicoreagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/5.-demographics.png) are between the age of 18 and 34... But sure \"oh no Facebook is not popular with the youngens\".\n\nThe next thing is do you actually believe TikTok because it's gaining some traction with teenagers. It's going to retain them till they to themselves are 65... Just like how not long ago Snapchat was all the rage in highschools yet it's all but dead in places like the US.\n\nIt's blatantly obvious everything you've said here is your own personal bias view and why it carries very little weight. You ignored the majority of what I said so you can just go back in and double down on \"FaCeBoOk DeAd\" meme. So your either trolling or have some vested interest in Meta failing or TikTok succeeding. Either way all you've accomplished is looking like an idiot that lacks the ability think rationally.

Giving the customer a render of the place with a fully immersive experience in VR is far more exciting and visually appealing for the customer experience. Especially since the environment can be set up so that everything in the house can be interacted with and moved around and stuff. As a customer, that would be fantastic to be able to do that stuff yourself.

Think about practicals in other subjects too such as electrical engineering.
