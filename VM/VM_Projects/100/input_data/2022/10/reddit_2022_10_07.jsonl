For example, both NVDA and AMD earnings reported that data center (a lucrative segment) is doing well.\n\nOversupply seems to be leading to some price cuts at stores like NKE.

At the very least, the fact that some countries are struggling does not appear to be a decisive reason to pull money OUT of the US.\n\nExactly, but it's going to treasuries, not equities.  This is why the dollar is so strong right now - money is coming in.\n\nI think you're right that at present it's not that bad.  The main thing, IMO, is uncertainty.  The Fed said inflation was transitory then it wasn't.  Inflation this high isn't good for the economy, so we have to wait and see how long it takes to get it under control.  The geopolitical stuff going on isn't good, either.  War in Ukraine pushes up commodity prices and generally makes people fearful.  A huge break in Europe or elsewhere would not be good for the US, it never has been.  Everything is interconnected.   This being the first true tightening cycle since QE was first implemented adds to uncertainty as well.\n\nThere's also just the fact that that valuations need to come down to adjust for higher rates.  Higher rates mean less growth prospects for companies, especially tech companies, and there's really no arguing that valuations the last few years in those areas have been quite stretched.  So in a way some correction is normal.  Add to that the uncertainty and you have a bear market.\n\nIs it that bad?  No, I think you're on to something.  It's not that bad, but the thing is it's not smooth-sailing, either.  The path out of all of this isn't clear, and that's not good for investing.  People prefer to be conservative in this climate.\n\nI would argue that the correction we've seen hasn't been that bad, either. Sure, speculative names and even some not-so-speculative have been hammered pretty hard.  But look at stocks like PG, JNJ and KO - all trading well over 20 PE and with dividend yields lower than a 10 year treasury.  This is by no means max pain.\n\nI don't think people are freaking out.  March 2020 was freaking out.  2008 was freaking out.  Right now, IMO, the market is just saying it doesn't see a clear path forward.

Unemployment is a lagging indicator in a bad economy: things go to shit, and then people lose their jobs.. not the other way around.\n\nWe're getting more companies putting out earnings warnings. Oversupply means people aren't buying, so there's signals of less consumer confidence. That is never a good thing. And the oversupply tends to be with retail and tech. Food is still expensive, gas is starting to go back up, rents are slowly coming down but are still fucking insane.\n\nPowell has indicated exactly when the rate hikes will stop.

Hence my other post regarding 4% inflation, 4% fed funds, and 4% unemployment (you could change the 4s there to 5s to match the more official projections).  \n\n(Also, on corporate earnings, oversupply would likely involve: higher revenues, higher costs of good sold, but companies can make up for it with layoffs and lower capex.  Layoffs might not raise the unemployment rate significantly as the job market remains tight and the latest report still shows a shortage, to some extent due to a mediocre participation rate.)\n\nI remember a time when the fed funds was 5%, people did not blink an eye on that, and stocks still went up (albeit more slowly than the booms of some recent times).

You see, low rates encourage businesses, governments, and individuals to take on debt, because at low rates it's much easier to pay off.  This is actually the entire idea.  If more entities take on debt, businesses can expand more,  consumers can spend more, etc.  This greases the wheel of the economy and gets it going on. \n\nThe problem is, you could argue, that perpetually low rates are just kicking the can down the road. All that future consumption and investment being brought into the present eventually has to be paid for.  If rates remain low, no problem.  But again, the problem is what happens when rates go up.  Because most debt isn't just a one-and-done at fixed rates, most debt is constantly rolled over. I have to pay my old debt with some amount of new debt.  If interest rates are near 0%, great!  But what happens if they're 4 or 5%?  Suddenly it becomes a lot harder to refinance, it's more expensive. \n\nThe stock market may know this, but perhaps a more direct technical application is simply that higher rates mute growth.  It's easier for a company to grow, in theory, when a loan only costs 1% interest than if it costs 5%.  Therefore stock prices should reflect those higher future profits, and since 2008 or even earlier they have - valuations have been really high.  Now that borrowing is becoming more expensive (higher rates) stocks have to go back down to a level that is justified by lower future profits. Look at bond yields, too.  If I can get a risk-free return on a 10 year US treausury (the US government has never defaulted) of 4%, well, why would I risk so much on stocks that only pay 1-3% dividends?  That dividend yield needs to come up to justify that added amount of risk. Of course stocks are not only about dividends but rather total return, but you add that in as another factor in addition to the increased cost of borrowing / lower growth prospects.\n\nThe question may arise that why would we even raise rates at all?  Well, for decades we basically haven't.  But now we have to because inflation is out of control.  We've been lucky that since the 80s we haven't had any meaningful inflation but now we do again.  Raising rates helps tame inflation because it means people will borrow and spend less.  There are other reasons we might want to raise rates, too, like trying to prevent so much debt in the system or sky-high asset prices in the first place.  But the Fed's framework is not concerned about those things, that's an outsider point of view.\n\nI'm not sure what to recommend to you because I tend to listen to heterodox perspectives rather than the mainstream.

So your question is, why does the MSCI assign only 3% of its index to China?\n\nThe answer is MSCI defines in their own way the universe of public equities to represent the global stock market. They have recently been upping the inclusion of Chinese equities, but it appears they place eligibility rules on inclusion. Put shortly, they want to make sure the equities being added are investible; if Chinese regulators block global trading of certain stocks or there are weird tax rules, the MSCI won't want to add them to the index. There are also some corporate governance rules required. Many index funds track it so it wants to be careful in how it modifies the index. They also need to be careful in how quickly they add new stocks, since this could cause instability in passively manged funds.\n\nThus, the MSCI doesn't literally match the market cap representation of global stock markets, but that of the 'investible' global stock market in their view. Other indexing companies could redefine their weights of China, but chances are they also take into account some inclusion rules. They want their rules to be popular to the index fund companies, so they have an incentive to make their indices function well. This is also why academics who study global stock markets don't always just use MSCI or S&P or FTSE. They have to go further and derive their own indices to answer their research questions about the Chinese stock market.\n\nAnd, of course, GDP doesn't determine stock market allocations.\n\nFor the same reason, you will find limited representation of stock markets in many emerging or frontier markets. So you aren't getting true diversification into the markets of Iran, Afghanistan, Syria, Cuba, ... Not that you would necessarily want them.\n\nSimilar issues will arise with small cap stocks.

Without a US dollar, there is no constant to lend money on besides gold or a crypto everyone magically decides is the new currency.

Now imagine that same regime now has to deal with significantly less luxury goods and almost no new technologies. Or they have to deal with food shortages, because they now have to import food from non-allies of the US. A war naturally upsets people, a war while your quality of life goes to shit is the grounds for rebellion. And a war while you’re starving and your quality of life sucks is grounds for revolution!\n\nRemember, China produces all that crap and sells it to foreigners instead of its own people because in the end the Chinese population isn’t as wealthy as the American one, especially by a per capita measurement. And when China needs to export, what does it get paid in? USD. And when China needs to import, what does it pay in? USD.\n\nAnd the US relies on China too, it’s mutual.

If you stop writing checks to Netflix are you not reducing your monthly budget?  Does it really make a difference that you only had Netflix because you were bored during the pandemic? That since now that you are coming out of covid mode and have other things to do you don't need the program anymore?   No.  You reduced your budget.  Period.  There are no hairs to split here.  You're saying what you mean wrong.  It isn't that there was no reduction, it was that you want FURTHER reduction to precovid levels.   \n\nSecond: the original argument was about reducing spending, not \"cutting\" spending.  So that odd distinction was not even made at the start anyway.  There is no combination of words that you could string together that would make reduced spending not mean reduced spending.   It is a rose.  By any other name.   Less spending is reduced spending.    \n\nThird: Inflation doesn't care if government spending is from a temporary stimulus program or not so your point is utterly pointless.   \n\nI'm done.   Don't bother responding.  I'm just not interested in you.  The other guy at least was entertaining.  You said something so stupid it gave me a headache and when you repeated it you started to bore me.  And now after writing about how wrong you were I'm thoroughly bored.

No one knows what will happen for sure. Even an educated guess is still a guess.\n\nWe can use some of the data available to us and our own experience to make what on paper is a smart move, only to have it blow up in our faces.\n\nMy only advice to you is to do these things:\n1. Don’t invest money you can’t be without.\n2. Educate yourself on stock terms and stock history.\n3. Distance your emotions from money. That’s not to say don’t have ethics. I won’t directly invest in oil, meat, or dairy for example — even though there’s a lot of money to be made in those industries. But don’t think with your fears and don’t mourn lost dollars.\n4. Decide what kind of investor you want to be. I am a bear. I make incremental, strategic investments. It’s rare that I put most of my chips in one stock. I don’t do options and try to avoid dark pool firms. I play it on the straight and narrow. I think about what’s going to be taxed from my gains as much as the gains themselves. That works out for me. Over seven years, I’ve grown a portfolio of 5k up to 250k, then used 150k on a down payment for a house 3 years ago. Used another 75k on other needed expenses (new car, house remodels, etc). The remaining 75k now swings in this wild market between 150-170k over the past 3 years. I mostly invest in tech and tech-related manufacturing. This is what works for me and I don’t see myself changing my strategy any time soon.\n5. Learn from every mistake you make and, if you can, try to see the positive. Example: I lost about 15k to weed stocks as a bag holder. I sold two weeks ago and accepted the loss. Recently, Biden signaled steps toward legalizing weed. Weed stocks rallied just after I sold.

{"title": "Not Great, Not Terrible: Why I Valued Meta at $420 Billion", "selftext": "Here's where I pretend to do something useful in my life: [https://thinkvalue.substack.com/p/not-great-not-terrible-why-i-valued](https://thinkvalue.substack.com/p/not-great-not-terrible-why-i-valued)\n\n[META 0.14%↑](https://substack.com/discover/stocks/META) will have trouble returning to the high growth it enjoyed in the past, partly because of the economic slowdown but also because it has already settled-in its key market segments. While I envision a period of stagnating growth for the company, it is the profitability of the business that makes the investment attractive.\n\nGiven the company’s future prospects, future profitability estimates, and the current price of risk, I estimated the intrinsic value of Facebook at $420b or $156 per share, with a 1-year price target at $171 per share, implying a 23% upside.\n\n[**Feel free to download and edit the whole model yourself.**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bdBALql_IEULLJHlsAa1ZsvhPivJjdTPzXYfgStY6mE/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n[NYSE:META Estimated Intrinsic Value at $420 billion, 7th October 2022](https://preview.redd.it/6k7rj0w95ds91.png?width=1208&format=png&auto=webp&s=74771c99df0f83babbe08066ec4fd1c6a67992cc)\n\n## The Metaverse is Coming, Later\n\nMeta made a possibly rushed bet on the metaverse while getting slightly carried away in its peer campaign to offset public and regular attention from their business practices.\n\nStaking the company on a big promise such as the metaverse isn’t a bad tactic to “get it done”, but it will likely require more time and effort than anyone has initially estimated. This strategy is in contrast to [GOOGL 0.19%↑](https://substack.com/discover/stocks/GOOGL)’s approach where they have a diverse product portfolio, but end up discontinuing projects as no key executive has the steel to stake their reputation on them.\n\n### Reinvesting Into the Business\n\nMeta estimated a CapEx spend of [around $32b](https://s21.q4cdn.com/399680738/files/doc_financials/2022/q2/Meta-06.30.2022-Exhibit-99.1-Final.pdf) in 2022, but seems to be quietly trimming spending on headcount and likely internally freezing projects. In the future, I expect Meta to lower the focus on the metaverse project, and move to improving key advertising features of its platform (\\*cough\\* that buggy mess), providing new content creation features, and incentives for people and professionals to create content.\n\n### More or Better Content\n\nAs a maturing tech business, I believe that the company will have to reinvest more into existing features to make them fun (not engaging), and profitable for people.\n\nRegarding content creation, I imagine the business will engage in something like the following projects:\n\n* Hybrid-AI programs - content created by [AI](https://beta.openai.com/), but enriched by a content creator.\n* AI program - short AI created content snips.\n* Engaging in contractor services - reinvesting in strategic content creation, such as high search volume content, content for groups and assistance, etc.\n\n## Valuation\n\nI expect a slowdown of revenue growth in the coming year with a growth of 2% in 2023 and 7% in the 4 years thereafter, with a decay function converging to the riskfree rate at year 10.\n\nAs a maturing company, I expect Meta to start slightly declining in profitability and allocating more resources to improving the quality of existing features, this may result in a future adjusted EBIT margin of 28% down from the adj. EBIT margin of 47.5% in the last 12 months. I adjust EBIT by capitalizing R&D, as this is a key investment for a tech company like Meta. The cost of capital used at the start of the valuation is 9.75%.\n\n[Finally, here is the resulting model for Meta:](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bdBALql_IEULLJHlsAa1ZsvhPivJjdTPzXYfgStY6mE/edit#gid=1709167660)\n\n[NASDAQ:META Future Valuation Estimates, 7th October 2022](https://preview.redd.it/81628jbf5ds91.png?width=1208&format=png&auto=webp&s=75af983a315f2e5b36c2e516c48e936f2d5f4be0)\n\nHere is the table if you want to dig into the details:\n\n[NASDAQ:META Valuation Table, 7th October 2022](https://preview.redd.it/i88xxjzh5ds91.png?width=927&format=png&auto=webp&s=1119f6a004da3815047985cd408a50297b4b489b)\n\nYou can use this general model to fine-tune your view of the company’s future, as well as an explainer of why the market price has dropped for Facebook.\n\n### Risks\n\nMeta’s key competitors are YouTube and LinkedIn. YouTube may become more engaging with its “shorts” feature, and the platform is set up to produce more costly content via its revenue sharing program with creators. This is opposed to Meta, which produces “cheaper” content that can only be monetized by advertisers and influencers, while people have little incentive to be creative on the platform. This may slowly shift the platform to a low-value content aggregator. *Think about it, which of your favorite figures are on Meta, and how many are there exclusively?*\n\nMeta’s decision-making hierarchy seems to be structured top-down. While this allows for efficient execution of projects, the trade-off is that the administration is deaf to consumer feedback.\n\nThe metaverse project may be a large cash drain for investors, and nobody has the power to say “no” to the voting rights of the CEO. The best investors can do is leave - like Peter Theil, and that is a weak feedback mechanism which is starting to show its downside.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe market seems to be pricing the company at or even slightly below intrinsic value.\n\nMeta will have a rough period ahead, but can create additional value if it balances the business between focusing on internal quality and returning capital to investors.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qtxo2nxk5ds91.png?width=498&format=png&auto=webp&s=f700abffa3dc5d8aa851c2672aafb9f8506c6a38\n\n### Next Steps\n\n**Drop a TICKER in the comments, and I'll send you a spreadsheet you can tinker with.**\n\nWithin the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bdBALql_IEULLJHlsAa1ZsvhPivJjdTPzXYfgStY6mE/edit#gid=1709167660), there are a few things that can help you in your analysis:\n\n* Check out the competitor dashboard, that tells you where Meta ranks amongst key peers. You can also find your next research candidates there. I would move to [GOOGL 0.19%↑](https://substack.com/discover/stocks/GOOGL) next, as a higher quality stock.\n* If you are thinking of Meta in terms of trading, try the market sentiment analysis. This can help you better assess the short-term market disposition towards the stock.\n* Intrinsic analysis isn’t always the best option, so try comparing it with the multiple analysis in the sheet.

As the whole economy downturn, the advertisement spending will cut a lot.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I don't agree with some parts of this.  \n\n\nFor one, this article is way too focused on 'META', and not enough on how META makes money.  \n\n\nAdvertising on Facebook and Instagram is incredibly profitable for businesses, particularly in the e-Commerce sector.  \n\n\nIt would be a mistake to assume that LinkedIn is a threat to Facebook in any major way. Facebook's bread and butter does not have a HUGE overlap with LinkedIn. Two completely different platforms that cater to different segments.  \n\n\nI would wager that the biggest threats to Facebook are YouTube, TikTok, and Amazon.  \n\n\nParticularly Tiktok and Amazon.  \n\n\nFacebook has co-existed with YouTube advertising for a long time, but TikTok is projected to capture [$12 billion in advertising spend](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2022-06-23/tiktok-becomes-cash-machine-with-revenue-tripling-to-12-billion).  \n\n\nSimilarly, [Amazon has captured $32 billion in ad revenue](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/03/amazon-has-a-31-billion-a-year-advertising-business.html).  \n\n\nThe reason for why I believe Amazon and Tiktok are greater threats to META is the following:  \n\n\nA very big part of the advertisers on META are e-commerce brands. The same audience that is attractive to e-commerce advertisers is the same audience that would be targeted by TikTok & Amazon.  \n\n\nFor example:  \n\n\nIf I am a service-focused local advertiser (home remodelers, junk yards, plumbers, etc...) - Google is going to be my bread and butter. Although I don't have any insight, having worked in digital advertising for a long time, I can tell you that what these local service businesses make on Google would be hard to beat elsewhere.  \n\n\nI don't imagine that Facebook has ever done well in this sector and never would have.  \n\n\nThe reason being that if a plumber targets you with an ad on Facebook but nothing in your house is broken, then you're simply not going to convert. On the other hand, if something in your house DOES break, your almost immediate reaction is to go to Google and look up a plumber. And that's where Google excels, and always has.  \n\n\nAnd what are the chances that an ad on Facebook reaches you the immediate second that something breaks? Or that you remember that a month ago you had seen an ad on Facebook for a plumbing service?  \n\n\nFacebook's bread and butter are consumer brands. And these same consumer brands are the ones who are most likely to go to TikTok to reach those audiences. Why is my guess for why YouTube is pushing Shorts, and META is pushing Reels.  \n\n\nThey don't want to lose that specific audience segment.  \n\n\nSimilarly, if Amazon can improve their advertising algorithms enough so that sellers on its platforms can see greater returns on investment, that proves a very strong challenge to Facebook who would see diminished advertising on its platform from Amazon sellers.  \n\n\nThe growth and effectiveness on YouTube, TikTok, and Amazon are then what I believe to be the biggest threats to META's ad revenue.  \n\n\nI agree that META should have long diversified more (Alphabet makes 80% of its revenue from online advertising vs. META's 99%) but that's a different topic.  \n\n\nThe reason why I believe people should focus more on META's future as a go-to platform for online advertising is because the online advertising market is expected to grow to $1 trillion dollars in size by 2027, compared to $500 billion (roughly) as it is today.  \n\n\nIf META can continue to capture at least 20% of the total market, that would put its revenue at around $200 billion in the next 5 years.  \n\n\nBut this would be imagining that the company does NOTHING but try to keep up which I don't think is true of the platform, overall. The META execs are not silly and I would imagine their revenue figures would exceed $200 billion before 2027, which would make it significantly more valuable than \\~ $150's per share.  \n\n\nForgive any misspellings, I rushed through this", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "Man thanks for the productive comment, loved reading it.

Homes not built on elevated grounds are flooding in their living rooms, bedrooms, bathrooms, kitchens and garages.
