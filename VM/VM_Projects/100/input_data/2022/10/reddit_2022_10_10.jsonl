Fed officials also indicated they would continue hiking rates well above the current range of 3% to 3.25%.\n\nDimon said that while the Fed “waited too long and did too little” as inflation jumped to four-decade highs, the central bank is “clearly catching up.”\n\n“From here we let’s all wish him success and keep our fingers crossed that they managed to slow down the economy enough so that whatever it is, is mild — and it is possible,” he added.\n\n**‘To guess is hard, be prepared’**\n\nDimon said he couldn’t be sure how long a recession in the U.S. might last, adding that market participants should assess a range of outcomes instead.\n\n“It can go from very mild to quite hard and a lot will be reliant on what happens with this war. So, I think to guess is hard, be prepared.”\n\nDimon said the one guarantee he could be sure of was volatile markets. He also warned that this could coincide with disorderly financial conditions.\n\nAsked for his views on the outlook for the S&P 500\n\n, Dimon said the benchmark could yet fall by “another easy 20%” from current levels, adding that “the next 20% would be much more painful than the first.”\n\nSpeaking to a roomful of analysts and investors in early June, Dimon said he was preparing the bank for an economic “hurricane” caused by the Federal Reserve and Russia’s war in Ukraine.\n\n“JPMorgan is bracing ourselves and we’re going to be very conservative with our balance sheet,” Dimon said at the time. He advised investors to do the same.\n\nMarket participants are monitoring a highly anticipated inflation print on Thursday as well as a slew of corporate earnings.\n\nJPMorgan is scheduled to release third-quarter financial results on Friday.\n\nShares of the bank are down roughly 33% year-to-date.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/10/jpmorgan-jamie-dimon-warns-us-likely-to-tip-into-recession-soon.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/10/jpmorgan-jamie-dimon-warns-us-likely-to-tip-into-recession-soon.html)", "id": "y0j72b", "created_utc": 1665419473.0, "score": 2524, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 914, "comments": [{"body": "Ffs this is the longest build up to a recession ever.\n\nBy the time it actually comes it’s going to be over probably.", "score": 2726, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 76, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah, that’s my point… housing market definitely won’t be though.", "score": 34, "replies": []}, {"body": "Isnt a reset needed.

It's kind of like saying if the economy is doing well you should always buy a house.

The policy was originally slated to go into effect on November 3.\n\nBut the updated policy created a firestorm on social media over the weekend, with several former PayPal employees weighing in and criticizing the policy, including PayPal co-founder Elon Musk.\n\nFormer president of PayPal David Marcus tweeted, \"It's hard for me to openly criticize a company I used to love and gave so much to. But Paypal's new AUP goes against everything I believe in. A private company now gets to decide to take your money if you say something they disagree with. Insanity.\"\n\nPayPal immediately rolled back its policy update to exclude the new misinformation policy. The company told media outlets: \"PayPal is not fining people for misinformation and the language was never intended to be inserted into our policy.\" The payments platform said the policy update \"went out in error that included incorrect information.\"\n\nSource: [https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/paypal-stock-price-blowback-misinformation-policy-2500-fine-error-musk-2022-10](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/paypal-stock-price-blowback-misinformation-policy-2500-fine-error-musk-2022-10)", "id": "y0gz4n", "created_utc": 1665414111.0, "score": 1313, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 348, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|42|**First Seen In WSB**|2 months ago\n**Total Comments**|43|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|3 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=y0gz4n)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=y0gz4n)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Whoops, sorry guys.

Basically people saying “they are trying to fine their users, but we caught them red handed, make them pay for it by closing your account and shorting” when in reality if PayPal actually started fining their users, a real outrage would’ve occurred and a much larger volume of people would’ve closed their accounts and shorted PayPal. There was never anything to worry about, they weren’t going to fine anyone for bogus reasons, a huge over reaction.
