They sold them to Congress as essentially huge amounts of pork for the constituents in these communities, but they couldn't get them built, and the reasons go beyond traditional left vs right divisions. \n\nThe reasons were pretty unique to each community involved, but included: lack of engineering talent available in the rural areas where the station was located, environmental opposition, bankruptcies of construction and utility companies during the Great Recession, fear of accidents (Fukushima was very recent, and people in the Midwest still remember 3 Mile Island), farmer/rancher opposition to development on federal lands, and enormous cost and time overruns (see also rail and highway projects all over the country - we clearly have a broader issue with finishing infrastructure in general on time and under budget)\n\nEvery project was a little different and most were killed by some combination of these different types of issues. The political will was there, Congress and 2 presidents wanted this to get done, but the costs were too high, the knowledge base wasn't sufficient, and the community opposition was too strong.\n\nNowadays I think the best course of action is much smaller facilities with much lower generation capacity. They're easier to build and to maintain safely. They're easier to build for a single community and thus circumvent some of environmental/HOA/farmer opposition to building these huge facilities. They're cheaper, and thus less likely to balloon wildly in cost. Smaller generative capacity also means less waste, and thus less of an environmental footprint. Smaller physical footprint means it doesn't necessarily have to be out in the boonies where grad students don't usually live. \n\nProblem now is after a president from both parties got burned wasting a ton of money and goodwill trying to build these giant projects, they're both reluctant to make another push in that direction.

{"title": "Trading SPY Next 9 Days", "selftext": "**What We Know:**\n\n1. Jobs report Tuesday was bad: short term bullish, long term bearish \n2. UK almost shit the bed, but didn't: short term bullish, long term bearish \n3. Credit Suisse almost imploded, but didn't: short term bullish, long term bearish \n4. Fed called \"emergency meeting\" that wasn't really an emergency: no real signal \n5. People think the Fed meeting, and CS, and UK, and Jobs might make the fed pivot: short term bullish, long term who knows \n6. 10yr and 2yr rates have come down from their recent peaks: bullish \n7. OPEC+ is reducing production: bearish \n8. Volume has been very low: bearish, as the move higher has no conviction \n\n**What is Coming:**\n\n1. A more important jobs report Friday. If its bad (less than expected), it is bullish because it implies Fed will be closer to pivoting \n2. CPI October 13th: If its good (less than expected), it is bullish because it implies Fed will be closer to pivoting \n3. Potentially a lot of geopolitical and financial issues - or not\n\n**Context:** \n\n1. Powell/Fed just recently gave a dot plot that clearly shows no pivot is coming this year. To remain credible, they need to deliver on their word \n2. If we rally too much, and rates come down too much, then financial conditions are loosening. Fed seems very committed to be restrictive, which means more tightening. A rally will be met by a tighter fed, killing the rally. If you want the fed to stop, there needs to be capitulation and pain. \n\nThe last time we had a \"inflation has peaked, the fed won't be so hawkish\" rally it lasted 7 days and moved 5%, on 30m in volume \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qjtzyb8kaxr91.png?width=716&format=png&auto=webp&s=edbf91ebbc298217aa0f70768b67eacc424922a7\n\nAs of last night, the current rally has moved 6% in \\~4 (trading) days on 16.5m in volume. We have given almost 2% of that back already this AM. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gfghdecpaxr91.png?width=978&format=png&auto=webp&s=e30005800c99417f0d271d1961a9a0ddeeaf7da0\n\nNotice the RSI has bounced and is almost at the top of the range already.  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Cave paintings](https://preview.redd.it/seyyiov5bxr91.png?width=1173&format=png&auto=webp&s=902ce0ed297f86524c3ec2856478d8d6fa3974e2)\n\n**Where do we go from here?**\n\n* We broke 375 to the upside, which was a recently contested price point (pink line)\n* The next meaningful area up is 380 (orange line) \n* If we fall back below 375, like this AM, we probably retest the lows and go lower. Unless:\n   * If we get a bad (which means good) jobs report on Friday, we at least go to 380 \n   * If we get a good (meaning less than expected) CPI on October 13, we go to 390+\n\n**Powell / The Fed Controls This Market**\n\nJust keep in mind, Powell keeps saying the same thing: we need meaningful evidence that inflation is coming down. We are going to stick with it. There will be pain etc. The point is, the Fed already told us what the plan is for the rest of this year, and we don't hear from them *until November.* The plan is in place, no reason to assume it will change. \n\n**Will the Rally Continue?**\n\nFor the rally to continue we need very strong, and repeated evidence that inflation is coming down, we need for Credit Suisse and UK to not blow up, we need Russia to not use Nukes, we need oil to not get too high, we need no other problems from the rest of the world, and we need the cash on the sidelines to keep investing thinking that the bottom is in. The hopium must sustain us until the Fed speaks again, and THEN the fed needs to say something dovish. \n\n**Will the Rally Fail?**\n\nTo go down, we *anything* to spook the market. Any better than expected, the economy is still hot report will confirm this is a bear market rally and send us back to at least the lows to be tested again. \n\n**The Way I Will Be Trading it Is:**\n\n* Sell the -380/+390 call spreads, end of October expiration. Add to this position each time the market makes the very unnatural looking sustained moves higher. As VIX contracts, these sold calls really won't loose much even if we move higher. If VIX is coming down, sold calls don't hurt as much. \n* If the Jobs report is really bad, we are going higher. Buy back the 380s, and leave the 390s until the CPI report October 13th. \n* On October 13th, if CPI report is hot again, sell the 380 calls again. Use the cash received from the 380s to buy 355 puts expiring end of October (same exp date). VIX will have collapsed to 25-27 so the puts will be relatively \"cheap\" \n   * As VIX expands, and we move lower, the puts are going to print and your sold call spreads are going to print. \n   * As we approach the lows, sell the 345 puts, completing a debit spread if you think we are going lower. Sell the 365 puts creating a credit spread if you think we are going higher. (I will write another post at this time)\n* On October 13th, if CPI report is below expectations, it will be very bullish. Sell a -380/+370 put spread and keep your 390 calls. Hold for a few days...  (I will write another post at this time)\n\nThis bounce was expected, and I got it right last time: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xn2wn6/how\\_to\\_win\\_the\\_week\\_of\\_926/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xn2wn6/how_to_win_the_week_of_926/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)", "id": "xwd4zs", "created_utc": 1664982521.0, "score": 135, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 112, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|8|**First Seen In WSB**|2 years ago\n**Total Comments**|107|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xrtkjs/the_bull_case_for_oil/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xurrbx/tsla_time_to_sell_calls/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading_spy_next_9_days/) \n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=xwd4zs)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=xwd4zs)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "So funny to think that a bad job report is actually bullish as this implies an earlier pivot.

You can choose to push more heat and power into a chip to make it go faster, but it becomes less efficient.   Cloud data centers love this to lower power usage.  Laptop users crave this because for the same chip design, a smaller fabricated chip is going to use that much less power for the same performance.  \n\n* TSMC - 7nm is ~= INTC 10nm \n* TSMC is shipping Apple at 3nm, Nvidia at 5nm, AMD at 5nm.  \n* INTC 10nm is the smallest they currently can get.\n* TSMC will ship 2nm next year for Apple.\n* TSMC 2nm is expected to be 30% more efficient for Apple chips.\n* Apple tried to push TSMC on price for the 2nm contract, TSMC didn't have to budge on price.\n* Apple knows this tech is so good, and caved to the TSMC costs.\n* INTC 4nm is not due out until Q4 2023 (unless it slips, INTC track record hasn't been good lately).\n* INTC 4nm is going to be 50% less efficient than 2nm TSMC and a year behind.\n\nINTC may be a good financial buy, and if they execute to 4nm they are solidly the largest producer, with the 2nd best tech.   Qualcomm and Samsung will be about equal on tech, but behind in volumes.\n\nAMD will do nothing but gain marketshare against Intel in the mean time.\n\nPerformance-wise per chip...People are use to touting the top GHZ number and number of cores.   What's currently happening though is different slightly.   Performance per watt shows AMD in a huge lead and as stated above laptops and colo/cloud datacenter love that.\n\nAMD has a 170watt top chip now.  It runs 5.7ghz boost, but more telling is that it's base, non-boosted speeds are 4.5ghz.  Intel base clocks are all the way down into 3.2-3.6ghz on their chips.  To get peak boost performance they are raising the power requirements to 253w.   Yes, that high.   It gets them close to 6ghz if not running at 6ghz, but only for a short time before it overheats and only on a single core.   Servers do not run single core peaks, they run all day at lower power, and laptops would burn their batteries up in 10min if they ran 253w.   \n\nIt's continued erosion of the Intel position, they sat on manufacturing tech for 15yrs collecting profits, now they are playing catchup to TSMC.  They can do it, don't know if they will.  \n\n\nTL;DR: this might be the time to buy INTC, but they have yet to execute on 4nm fabrication, so profits will continue to decline.   Laptop buying peaked in 2020/21 with WFH, most won't need new kit for another 2-3yrs in the replacement cycle.  AMD will eat into market share, volume sales decline as well.

Look at the currently released cards and the naming schema - look at all the missing cards that were originally planned.  I think they dont have any margin on these current cards - sell at cost or loss basically.
