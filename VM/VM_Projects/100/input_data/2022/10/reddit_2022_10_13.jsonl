Soaring prices have finally prompted the central bank to issue aggressive rate hikes and begin shrinking its balance sheet this year – but the rapid pace of tightening could easily send the economy into a recession, economists have warned.\n\n \"Powell is unbelievably late doing this. He sat still while the meme stock craze was going,\" Sternlicht said, adding that the belated reaction could kill off investors' gains across the entire market. \n\n \"There were really smart things that people did, and there were smart fish in the pond. And there were stupid things people did and they were idiot investments. … So you thought the healthy fish would survive and the sick fish would die. But the Fed is draining the entire pond, so everyone's going to die,\" he said.  \n\n Sternlicht added that the Fed could be overtightening the economy by basing rate hikes on the Consumer Price Index, which remains well above the 2% inflation target. But that index lags behind the economy by around 18 months, experts have said, meaning the central bank could be basing its rate-hike decisions on outdated information — and it risks screeching the economy into a downturn.\n\nCurrently, the Fed expects to keep hiking until it hits a terminal rate of 4.6%. That's more than a full percentage point above the current fed funds rate, and it could mean the central bank is set to hammer the economy, costing \"millions\" of jobs around the world, he said.\n\n\"I just get so angry when people say the Fed needs credibility to fight inflation. Wait. You'll get what you want. You'll get this recession; it's definitely coming.\"\n\nBut despite anticipated market volatility, he noted long-term investment opportunities could be coming to the surface, as stocks will eventually be discounted and some will be poised to rebound. \n\n\"I am personally looking for opportunities that I think represent incredibly compelling long-term investments, and I think you're beginning to see them,\" Sternlicht added.", "id": "y2xy26", "created_utc": 1665665477.0, "score": 95, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 103, "comments": [{"body": "I find this an interesting analogy as the Mississippi River is about dry in some places.

But that's inflation that is technically already accounted for in past months.  When looking forward, we should care more about the rate of change of inflation, and less about the absolute value.  Reducing inflation from 8.5% to the Fed's goal of 2% doesn't mean goods suddenly cost 6.5% less than they do now, it means the rate of growth has slowed down by 6.5%.  If the rate of MoM increases stays low around 0.1-0.2% for the next 12 months, then by the 12th month inflation will crater because the YoY comparison is able to \"catch up\" and is suddenly very favorable.\n\nWhat I'm saying is that it takes TIME for inflation to go down.  It's not like suddenly in Nov the YoY is going to drop to 2%.

I believe at one point, most Americans got their news from FB and when that became the case, FB should have done something to ensure what people were ingesting as \"news\" actually had some basis in reality.\n\nIt's become a virtual meeting place for extremists on all sides of the political spectrum, which is dangerous because their algorithm is designed to feed people more of what they want to see, and if they want to see shit that will make them angrier, FB is more than happy to feed it to them, as long as it keeps the user logged in.\n\nIs that different from Reddit or other social media platforms? Not really, but when you've got nearly 3 billion users, you've got much more power and influence than a platform like Reddit, or really any platform with the possible exception of YouTube which has just over 2 billion users.

I'm a business owner and manage and run all of my digital advertising. Every single platform I use is user friendly, works most of the time, and actually helps me find customers (Google, Bing, etc.). In addition to Meta/FB getting in trouble over the years regarding privacy, their platform has always been crap and they've done a huge disservice to advertisers. Just run a search for \"Facebook Ban\" on r/PPC and you'll find hundreds and hundreds of posts from legitimate businesses that FB has suddenly decided to ban for no reason and with no explanation and now can no longer use their platform.\n\nI used FB to advertise for years. Never with great results, but I did find customers from it. My ad account would get soft banned by their AI system multiple times a year for breaching policy, sometimes multiple times a month. Every time I reached out to support they told me it was a mistake, that I've broken no policy, and should not have been restricted from advertising and reinstate my account.\n\nThen one time, it was a hard ban (permanent) and now I can no longer use their platform to advertise my legitimate and non-spammy business (FB is rife with spam and fake 'businesses'). Worse, when you reach out to support, there's literally no one that can help you. I've provided screen shots of all the times I was told that I never broke a policy and am using the platform correctly. But if you ever did something their all-knowing AI didn't like, you would get restricted. Case in point - One time I simply copy/pasted an ad in my account. Boom! Soft banned until I reached out to support about it. I guess that's what spam accounts do? idk... I know other advertisers who've been banned for raising the budget, pausing an ad, duplicating a campaign, the list goes on and on.\n\nThe permanent ban is particularly frustrating because you lose access to support channels. Meaning there is literally no way for me to contact Meta/FB and ask them to resolve it. Luckily I have other platforms I can use to advertise, but think about all the small digital and family owned businesses that have been screwed over by them. (Check r/PPC and you'll find them aplenty).\n\nOh, and their ad platform has gotten less effective over the years because of the privacy issues and other lawsuits.

However, it may also cause a bunch of system-critical companies, institutions and pension funds to blow up, with their underlying pensioners and dependents losing everything. We’ve already seen this in the UK. We’d therefore preserve *most* people’s 8% purchasing power, at the *small* price of a small number of pensioners etc losing everything.\n\nThe third, worst outcome is that the Fed goes hard as above, pension funds etc blow up, and inflation still doesn’t come down. Everyone loses 8%, some lose everything. \n\nI’m not an economist and don’t know which outcome would be more damaging for society, and which is most likely to happen.

IMO this old (and good) advice only works when people **also** sell their riskier assets (stocks and junk bonds) to hold safer assets (cash, high quality bonds and some blue chips and passive ETFs). \n\nThe problem is investors still hold huge amounts of stocks (60%+) , the junk  to AAA bonds spread is still very low and we keep having net cash **inflows** into the stock market.

It was exactly the WSBers and retail that caused it.

Buy a put at $257, and how ever far below $257 the stock falls you earn the difference. So if it falls to $247, you make $10. A put is a 100 shares, so $10 x 100= $1000.\n\nCalls are the mirror opposite. Buy a call at $257, and if the stock goes to $267, you make $10. A call is 100 shares as well, so still $1000. \n\nHowever you pay a fee to buy a call or put, that's called the premium. So if you factor in that fee you paid (the premium) the stock might need to go up/down by more than $10 to make that $10. Example, you buy a banana worth $10 for only $2. If the value of the banana gets to $20, you didn't make $10, you made $8. The banana needs to go up by $12 for you to make $10.\n\nKeep in mind calls and puts are always chunks of 100 shares. If you look at an options price list, you'll see the premium as $1.23, $0.76, $5.89 or whatever. That's the premium PER share. So a call with a $5.89 premium will cost $589. \n\nAll puts/calls have an expiration date. Basically you are placing a bet that the stock price will rise (call) or fall (put) to a level that makes you money before (or on, for many here) that date. Days, weeks, months, years out. The further away the date, the higher the premium.\n\nSay a stock costs $57 a share. If you just bought 100 shares of it outright, it'd cost you $5700. But if you bought a call option on that stock with a premium of $4.80, you'd pay $480 to control 100 shares of that stock. Waaaay cheaper. For $5700 in call options you could control like 1500 shares of that stock. That's the beauty of it.\n\nThe danger of it is that you are basically placing bets that the stock is going to move in a specific direction within a specific time period.\n\nThere are other factors like delta, theta (and others, called \"greeks\") that affect the prices of options.

These increases were partly offset by a 4.9-percent decline in the gasoline index. The food index continued to rise, increasing 0.8 percent over the month as the food at home index rose 0.7 percent. The energy index fell 2.1 percent over the month as the gasoline index declined, but the natural gas and electricity indexes increased.\n\n The index for all items less food and energy rose 0.6 percent in September, as it did in August. The indexes for shelter, medical care, motor vehicle insurance, new vehicles, household furnishings and operations, and education were among those that increased over the month. There were some indexes that declined in September, including those for used cars and trucks, apparel, and communication. \n\n The all items index increased 8.2 percent for the 12 months ending September, a slightly smaller figure than the 8.3-percent increase for the period ending August. The all items less food and energy index rose 6.6 percent over the last 12 months.

Taxes are how the government removes money from the system to prevent devaluation of its currency. Not how the government funds itself. \n\nGovernments aren’t households or corporations, they don’t need to make a ‘profit’.  \n\nThe problem is that the effective tax rates on corporations is 0.

It is like the other poster said, taxes are the government's way of removing money from the system. The other ways to remove money from the system are through higher interest rates at the Fed or through increased imports relative to exports. \n\nI think what you are referring to is that the net impact of government intervention will only be deflationary if the gov runs a surplus. In other words, if the government runs a surplus then they are actually causing negative growth. If the government continues spending at current levels but increases taxes, but not enough to result in a surplus, it will still reduce inflation, but it won't cause negative growth. \n\nI think the best explanation of this comes from the Economist Anwar Shaikh. Inflation is dependent on a complex interplay between purchasing power and the growth utilization rate. Those can be further broken down into an interplay between 1) credit vs savings, 2) government spending vs taxation, and 3) imports vs exports. Each one of those will impact inflation in their own way, as well as impacting the other factors. For example, if the Fed increases interest rates, it reduces the amount of credit in the system and pushes money into savings, thereby reducing purchasing power and lowering inflation. But higher interest rates will also raise the value of the currency, which will promote imports and reduce exports, further reducing inflation. All of this happens without any intervention from the elected government. \n\nThis also makes it very hard to link inflation solely to government spending. If the government runs a deficit, then their net action is inflationary. But if the money they spend increases imports and decreases exports, then the two factors will counteract each other. This is why the insane military budget hasn't caused massive inflation. Military manufacturing requires importing tons of raw materials, but there is no associated export because the end product gets sold to the government. Therefore government spending (+ inflation) results in increased imports (- inflation) and we end up with stable inflation despite increased gov spending.", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "Our AI tracks our most intelligent users.

If I had to guess how earnings season is going to go before the next rate hike, I’d be willing to bet there’s going to be a lot of chop with little to no continuation below 3400 before the next rate hike. In fact, depending on where we are at, that hike might even spur a relief rally based on technicals just to screw options holders. I believe that will be the theme over the next month. Institutional longs will short volatility to continue to support and consolidate the market while retail and short term capitulates. There will be fewer and fewer 2%+ days as we get closer to midterms and Nov rate hike.

Long dated options by design have a very low theta, yet decent deltas and vega. Thus you will benefit from a large move in the underlying or high volatility more easily.

It just caps your gains a bit, but I think leads to higher win rates. Plus it allows you to trade with the trend - trend continues, you hold/sell gains. With 6 mo-1year options, if the long term price trend holds you continue to make money (assuming you bought into a lower point of volatility). If the trend reverses at any point, you lose your paper gains but can sell for little to no loss. The only time you get fucked is if you buy RIGHT before a large trend reversal (say 2020 Covid Bottom).

That’s options 101. Picking the right direction really helps but if you buy a 10% IV option and it goes the wrong way and sell it as a 40% IV option you might even make a profit.\n\nFor example a 10/31 SPY 365P has a Vega of .32, this means for a 1% change in IV, expect a .32 change in pricing. This too scales exponentially like theta. The same 365P with a Jan 2023 exp has a Vega of .75! So with every 1% move in IV you get nearly double the change in contract pricing with the longer dated option. So even though it “seems” as if the longer dated option is “safer” because you have more opportunity for delta to outpace theta, the risk is still there it’s just you’re more vulnerable to IV (which is less predictable) than you are to theta decay (which is very predictable).\n\nLongs story short… the less you hold options the better.. purely statistically speaking. There is a lot of nuance in calculating risk/reward depending on the strategy and timeframe.\n\nEdit to clarify: IV almost always goes down over time as more unknowns become known.

Realestate comes with taxes and headaches plus you don't own it anyway... If you think you own it go ahead and don't pay your property tax... So that leaves stocks. The reason the market hasn't smashed down to QQQ at 150 is there is literally NOWHERE else to put your money. The money itself is garbage. That explains the market action. There is nowhere else to put your cash. 30% of the Russell are companies that cannot survive in a high interest rate in environment. Most of them have less than 1 year of cash left. There is still going to be a reckoning. BUT just because 30% of the market is pure horseshit doesn't mean it all is. The bottom line is it's always been a stock pickers market, so pick companies that are run well. Last night I took a look at VUGs holdings just to see wtf. In the first few minutes I found 30 companies that were obviously headed for BK within months of their IPO. They are still holding a company that the CEO said last week they don't think they will survive 6 months... So what's my point. Don't trust fking ETFs. It's still a stock pickers market and has always been. I can't predict QQQ or SPY. But I know without a doubt. Cash and Bitcoin are fundamentally WORTHLESS stocks in companies that can actually turn a profit are not. They may turn out to be worth less but they aren't worthless.

That is baked in, and the Fed is not going to back off on it.  It's happening.  It's the following advertised 75 basis point raise that is now in question, even though the Fed has previously clearly stated it will indeed happen.  \n\n But because of the British financial crisis and the Saudi oil production cut, the macro parameters have fundamentally changed.  Now the Fed is under pressure to soften the 2nd 75 basis point raise to 50.  Together with a relatvely bland CPI increase, this is the uncertainty that led to today's pop.  Some are shifting their bets to the 50 basis point softening, there has been a shift in sentiment regarding the Fed's future plans.\n\nBut is the sentiment just wishful/hopeful thinking?  Or have the macro parameters actually fundamentally changed?  Oil is down.  Oil up, inflation up, market down.  Oil down market up.  I look at oil.  Everything in this country travels to market by truck.  The OPEC+  production cut will result in gas going up, and inflation going up, but there will be a time delay before it happens.  \n\nSo today's pop is a bear trap.  Oil is going up, inflation will follow, and neither a 75 or a 50 basis fed adjustment will affect the piece of gas in the short term.  Only $6 a gallon gas will affect the price of gas and cause the oil supply to increase as Americans stop using their cars as much.  The Fed knows this, so it will stick with two 75 basis point adjustments.  When this becomes more clear in the next month or so, the market will drop lower.  Whether or not the financial system may blow up will become clearer around the same time.  Hold on to your popcorn.  It's all a toss up still, but sentiment will revert to a system of heavy down soon.  I see another 20% drop overall.
