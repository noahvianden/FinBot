The yield on the policy-sensitive [2-year Treasury](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/US2Y/) traded up five basis points to 4.608%.\n\nYields and prices move in opposite directions and one basis point equals 0.01%.\n\n\"I think 4% was reasonable,\" said Wells Fargo's Michael Schumacher. \"4.22% has become unanchored. We don't need the 10-year to act like a meme stock. That is not healthy.\"\n\n \n\nMany investors have been concerned about the economy contracting as the Federal Reserve has been hiking interest rates to fight persistent inflation. Another 75 basis point hike is expected from the central bank at its next meeting on Nov. 1 and 2.\n\nOn Thursday, Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker said that the Fed would continue raising rates.\n\n\"Given our frankly disappointing lack of progress on curtailing inflation, I expect we will be well above 4% by the end of the year,\" Harker said.\n\nThe 10-year yield moved to new highs after Harker's remarks. Fed funds futures for next May crossed 5% for the first time on Thursday.\n\nOn the economic front, initial jobless claims came in at 214,000, below the 230,000 expected by economists according to Dow Jones. However, the Philadelphia Fed manufacturing index showed a larger than expected decline.\n\nU.S. housing starts and building permits data for September came in below expectations on Wednesday, which investors widely understood as a sign of recession in the housing sector.\n\nIn Europe, U.K. Prime Minister announced her resignation.

I suspect that big tech earnings could add further fuel to a rally next week, as the market wants to pump and is likely to overlook negatives unless these companies really blow up on forward guidance.

If you factor in risk free rates, the drop in equity valuations 2000-2002 was massively more dramatic than what we’ve seen so far.  Then the S&P 500 dropped over 50% while the 10 year Treasury yield dropped 300 basis point.  The equity risk premium grew massively like maybe triple.  So far in this cycle, it’s gone down despite the decline in stock prices.\n\nIt would not shock me if we see something like the long deflation in share prices from 2000-2002, but it also wouldn’t surprise me if we don’t.

Additionally, if the environment gets worse, the \"pent up\" travel demand seen earlier this year will start to fizzle further - travel a particularly lousy sector in a recession. \n\nI am not short it but you've seen a lot of obliteration in 2020's \"new way to\" stocks (CVNA \"new way to buy a car\", UPST) etc. I think in 2020, ABNB was viewed as something that was going to disrupt hotels, but it increasingly feels like it's going to be more niche than people think, plus they have to figure out some degree of standardization. \n\nThis sort of thing: \"Travelers are slamming Airbnb chore lists that tell guests to mow the lawn, do the laundry, and take out the trash — on top of paying $125 cleaning fees\" (https://www.businessinsider.com/travelers-slam-airbnb-chore-lists-mow-lawn-laundry-cleaning-fees-2022-9) isn't good - if people become more concerned what kind of list of chores they will be presented with at their next airBNB more and more people are going to avoid them if possible and you're going to see more of this opinion: https://twitter.com/alyse_themv/status/1582011341992210432. Someone else in the same thread: \"I can stay at a nice hotel,get a massage and order room service for the same price as staying in Super Host Sally’s work house.\"\n\n Also, given how much housing AirBnBs take up, in a world where affordable housing is an increasing issue especially given high inflation, it would not surprise me in the slightest if AirBnB eventually becomes more restricted by communities and potentially increasingly viewed in a negative light to some degree. It's too bad more and more people have piled on the fees and chores. It already has been in some areas over the years, but with inflation these debates may start to really get brought up again. \n\nABNB will probably have a decent bounce if growth ever has a sustained lift (and maybe if that occurred sooner than later, I'd take a closer look at betting against it), but I just think it will eventually see a more realistic valuation lower as while alternative rentals are definitely going to continue to be a thing, they're not - especially if AirBNB can't get a little more standarization of the fees and other specifics - going to challenge hotels in the manner that people thought during the height of the pandemic.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Oh yes.

The last core CPI was still 8.1%, and there hasn't been any real indication that it has dropped since those numbers were analyzed, nor any real indication that they will.\n\nI have no real opinion on what the fed should do, because it's going to suck either way. But, being working class, inflation really fucking sucks right now and I'm holding all cash except for my 401k, which I've already pretty much kissed good-bye, so I'd rather that get addressed as a priority.

Or you take your foot off the gas, or worse, let inflation rip, and then experience what real pain is in the economy.\n\nIdk, pick your poison but some people seem to be thinking that this game of cat and mouse with stocks right now is worse than their entire portfolio just taking an Olympic pool sized synchronized shit on the bed at some point in the near future if the hikes slow or stop.\n\nBulls are so obsessed with running around yelling about what the market does historically, and don't take into account what happens when everything hits the fan.

Powell has said what it was, but you dumbasses don't want to listen to him or are trying to read something into his statements that isn't there. 4.6%. He is not going to stop raising rates until we get there or at least close to there.\n\nTake into consideration the context: we've had rate hikes now for 8 months.

The short sighted are looking at their portfolios and having a meltdown right now, because they're not looking at what would actually happen if the hikes stopped prematurely. They're not prepared to grapple with the fact that doing so will cause inflation to spiral out, and not only cause it to spiral out, but do so against the backdrop of falling production.

At least they weren't significantly more overvalued in 2021 when compared to valuations in say 2016.\n\nWhat the market got \"wrong\" was inflation - and I put wrong in quotes because I'm not even sure to what extent that is true just yet.\n\nWhat is true is that near-term valuation are extremely dependant on treasury yields because the treasury market is how investors calculate the risk free return which all investment returns are benchmarked against. If you take the 10y yield in 2021 and apply that to today's earnings the S&P500 would probably be around $5,000.\n\nSo like I say, valuations just weren't that unreasonable in 2021 if you thought inflation expectations were correct. But the market got inflation wrong so the 1 - 2% yields the market priced in 2021 had to move up significantly and today they're closer to 4 - 5%. So I think what you're asking indirectly here is why the market got inflation wrong which I'm happy to go into if you like, but it's complicated.\n\nBut this doesn't really explain why some companies are down so much and I think in a lot of case this is more complicated to explain. This is because in addition to adjusting for rates a lot of the software sector has also been rerated, and in some cases its hard to explain why.\n\nFor stocks like PTON it's easier to understand though. They're an unprofitable company which had been fuelling their growth with debt and that debt is now much more expensive. At the same time their growth is slowing and their costs are far higher today because of all the expanding they did in 2021 which assumed their growth would continue. The growth slowdown and higher borrowing rates means their business model is now completely broken and a lot of hot pandemic-era companies fell into a similar trap (FSLY, COIN, HOOD, etc).\n\nBut there are other stocks which have been punished significantly which I don't understand as much. Stocks like CRM, TWLO and SHOP, for example. These aren't in debt and in the case of CRM and SHOP are cashflow positive so don't need debt either. I think the story here is more that the macro poses significant headwinds for growth and they have a history of share dilution which isn't what investors want to see right now. Additionally while I don't think their business models are broken, they are more questionable compared to your highly profitable big tech companies which again I think is fuelling doubt in such uncertain times.\n\nBut when you adjust for valuations for 2021 growth and inflation projection vs the growth and inflation projections today that explains 80% of the moves we're seeing imo. Don't underestimate the valuation impact of taking average YoY growth projections for a company down from 30% to 20% while taking the risk free rate up from 1.8% to 4.2%.", "score": 30, "replies": [{"body": "While a thoughtful response full of truths, you appear to believe in the notion that markets are rational.

GOOG and META are two other examples of solid companies which seem to be pricing in the fear of what might happen if the economy takes a turn for the worse rather than what actually is happening.\n\nThis is why I'm buying stocks like TWLO right now because it's stupidly valued and whenever I've talked about the stock it's been clear that most people are not thinking about it rationally.

Unless they had other reasons?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "This is just my opinion, no one knows for sure, but I think the fiscal stimulus was a wildcard that happened to be far more inflationary that anyone could have expected. But I don't think it was just the fiscal stimulus alone that alone did it, it was the stimulus combined with lockdowns which led to record saving rates and consumers paying down debts. And also that low interest rates allowed everyone with a mortgage to refi and lock in a historically low rate. This eventually led to a surge in demand and an extremely interest rate insensitive consumer.\n\nThere's two ways in which interest rates slow economic growth, the first being to make savings more attractive, and the second to make borrowing more expensive meaning more income goes towards paying down debt and debt is used less often to fund consumption. But when the consumer has no credit card debt, record high savings and the only debts consumers do have are mortgages fixed at record low rates you effectively fuel demand and destroy the primary method by which interest rates work to slow it.\n\nThis is why I put \"wrong\" in quotes because in some sense I'm not sure the market or the Fed actually got the neutral rate of interest wrong. I think that what we're seeing is a temporary (but fairly durable) boom in demand fuelled by excessive fiscal stimulus, low debt and high savings which means the Fed has no effect tools to fight the excess demand we've been seeing. We basically just have to let this run through the system then if our models on inflation are right, we should see it trend back down. I'd argue we're seeing this slowly happen now with savings coming down and credit card debt going back up, but it's just going to take time before consumers have to change spending habits.\n\nWhat I don't agree with are all weird theories we're seeing today trying to explain inflation via a lack of energy investment or deglobalisation trends because that doesn't explain why inflation spiked as dramatically as it or why interest rate hikes seem to be doing so little to combat it. It also goes against everything we previously believed about the neutral rate of interest being likely to trend lower in coming years with aging demographics, slower population growth and lower productive growth.\n\nIt would be silly to think inflation is just being caused by one thing though. There are clearly other factors at play here which aren't helping such as supply-chain disruptions and the war in Ukraine, but I don't think these sufficiently explain the spike we're seeing in demand.

I know I had friends asking me about inflation in 2021 and the logic then was the typical \"QE is going to cause hyper inflation\" narrative, which it literally never does.\n\nBut this time it wasn't just QE, it was governments around the world borrowing at record amounts and giving that directly to consumers while supply chains were largely shutdown. For whatever reason we we're all so focused on \"money printer go, brrr\" that no one stopped to think about the unprecedented fiscal stimulus that was happening - maybe because we're so used to governments borrowing money and spending it in stupid ways anyway.\n\nI remember some heated debates on /r/investing back in 2021 where some of the more knowledgeable users who worked on Wall St were routinely \"debunking\" the runaway inflation theories circulating there, because again they were all coming at it from the central banking / QE angle while making factually incorrect claims about QE being equivalent to money printing.\n\nSo I don't know why the Fed or any of the \"experts\" didn't see it, but if I were to guess I think the lockdowns + fiscal stimulus were a kind of an unknown unknown that no one was really thinking about at the time.\n\nGiven what I've just argued though, I think the question to ask now is why is no one saying what I'm saying? At least I've not heard anyone in the Fed try to explain in any detail why they think they were wrong. They seem to be acting surprised and confused while making comments about how this might be similar to the 70s because that is the only perspective they have.\n\nBut if I'm right then the inflation we're seeing today is completely different from the 70s and we shouldn't be looking to historical parallels to explain / tackle it. It's quite possible we've now tightened way beyond neutral rate and the Fed is guiding the terminal rate far higher than it needs to be.

AM5 is a new socket that is the start of this generation.  They got 4 generations of ryzen on AM4, plus processors before ryzen was released.  Intel just released 13th gen a year after releasing 12th gen, and it really puts 12th gen to shame.  How did they do this?  More power and more cores.  Intel is trying to play catch up.  Also if you want to actually get the performance and features out of Intel you have to adopt windows 11.  This is not the case for AMD.   Also your comparison of the 7900x3d to the 14th gen wouldn't be an apt comparison since the x3d would be of this generation and 14th gen would be of the next generation for Intel, skipping the 13th gen altogether.  As for the 5950x3d it still holds plenty of performance for even cheaper.  it's currently 400 bucks for almost new generation performance from both AMD and Intel.  There are plenty of cheap AM4 motherboards and DDR4 for good prices to buy the 5050x3d and have fantastic performance in anything you do.  I'm even thinking of upgrading my 3600x to a 5950x3d this year.  But not even sure if I really need to as the 3600x has been a tank and had no issues for the past 3 years.\n\nAlso AMD is in both next-Gen consoles and intel isn't.  Ryzen plus Rdna2; everyone seems to love the next gen consoles.  I also don't believe that AMD will loose these contracts going into the next generation after this.  There have been too many improvements from AMD and their chiplet design with minimal power draw increase.  If you follow ryzen design process so far, AMD throws performance at you with decent power level draw, the subsequent generations then increase power and decrease power draw. So by the time the next generation of consoles are released I'm sure that AMD will have a less power draw with more performance than we are seeing in ryzen 7.\n\nI just don't see a down turn in AMD's immediate future barring something unforeseen happening.", "score": 4, "replies": []}, {"body": "Cool story bro.\n\nhttps://www.cpubenchmark.net/high_end_cpus.html", "score": -2, "replies": [{"body": "Lol what an ignorant comment, showing me threadripper cpus that don't even account for a percent of market share.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "epyc is amd's cash cow.\n\nyou don't seem to know what you're talking about.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Not even close, cash cow is commercial and business laptops, Money makers.
