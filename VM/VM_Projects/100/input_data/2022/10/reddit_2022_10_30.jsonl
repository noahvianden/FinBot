That should be part of your trade plan.  Yes, sometimes you can roll your shorts but it is possible that a situation will happen where it makes sense to let them get called away.\n\nAs far as losing your shirt, if done correctly you can’t really lose with CCs other than opportunity costs.

Normally that could get you into trouble if you end up writing strikes below your cost basis, but if your split-adjusted cost basis from 5 years ago is like $5/share, that won't be a problem for a while. What is your split-adjusted cost basis?\n\nHere's the problem. Say you buy shares for $100/share and start writing .3 delta calls as the share price drops to $60. As you write calls below the $100 strike (because that's where .3 delta is), you run the risk of having your shares assigned at a loss. Say .3 delta is $75. If the price rises back to $80, you could get assigned a $75/share, which is $25/share below your cost basis. It is unlikely that you will have accumulated enough credit from CCs to compensate for that large loss.\n\nCan you roll yourself out of this problem by rolling up and out? Maybe. The larger the loss, the less likely you will be able to roll your way out, even if you are willing to have ridiculously long holding times, like a call that expires in 2 years. Even then you might not be able to roll all the way above your cost basis, if the decline is large enough, so after 2 years you could be right back in the same problem you started with.\n\nOn the bright side, TSLA is highly liquid with a lot of volatility, so the option chains are unusually large (distance from lowest strike to highest strike in the chain is several hundred dollars). This means its more likely you can roll yourself out of this problem for a while. The average option contract doesn't have chains that long, so it's more of a problem for the average stock.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "So I want to start of saying that I am not trading yet , I have not dipped my feet- as of now I am just trying to educate myself and learn as best as I can. I stumbled on a YouTube video regarding options. The YouTuber said she deals with Naked Calls and Puts- I looked up what that means and essentially from my understanding that is what when you make a call/put without owning any of the underlying shares. Now I've heard different things from different sources so I would appreciate it if someone cleared it up for me, is this a relatively safe way to trade or not? The reason I'm asking is because I've seen a side or reddit say it's not risky if you do your due diligence and manage your risk accordingly,  the opposing side says its extremely risky and the worst thing you can do. Now I am confused because I would like someone to tell me the truth, the YouTuber who's video I was watching stated she deals with those trades because she manages her risk and Essentially you can only lose what you originally invested. I'd like to know if that is accurate or not, if it's worth doing these type of trades or not, as well as some explanations.  I also understand that most options are rarely exercised but I would like to know on the off chance it is, am I screwed given the fact that I don't have those shares or the capital? Is there any sureway to avoid this or get around this (Sell to close) and could anyone go explain ?

The decision is exactly the same as deciding to take profits on shares that have appreciated or to hold for more profit. Just make sure that when you roll, you only roll for a credit and only for a reasonable expiration -- don't turn a 21 DTE into a 600 DTE just to squeeze out $.10 of net credit, because every other expiration was a debit.\n\nIt's a fools game to write CCs into a down market, UNLESS you are a long term holder of those shares and you will hold through any downturn no matter what. Then it's okay *as long as* you only write strikes above your cost basis. If the stock falls so low that the only OTM calls paying any credit are below your cost basis, stop writing CCs. Because you risk selling your shares at a loss at the worst possible time, when they recover and rally. It's a gamble as to whether you can roll yourself out of that predicament or not.

There is something missing in my understanding of how real world options trading works, so I thought better to ask here:\n\nI don't understand why do the Greeks or the Option value matter so much, once you have bought a position?\n\nIn textbooks, Option trading is explained this way: let a trader buy a Call Position on stock ABC at Strike $105, expiring whenever (the contract of buying 100 shares of ABC at $105). The current price of underlying stock ABC is $100. Now say, at some point the underlying reaches $110. Whether American-style or European-style, let's just say the trader either exercises the option, or it expires with underlying at $110.\n\nSo, the textbooks would say, the profit made is: $(110-105) x 100 = $500.\n\nLet the Option itself be valued at $10, so the *net* profit is $500 - $10 = $490.\n\nIn any of that, I don't see where the need for knowing the Greeks and how the Option value of $10 decays, matters? Option trading is presented as trading the underlying stock with leverage. Why do I have to worry about how the value of the derivative changes, when I already bought it? My only concern is where the underlying ends up. But the books just dive right into discussing all the Greeks and how they are impacted by variables like time to expiration, volatility, Moneyness of the option.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I just want to know what I am missing here? Do we actually buy a Call/Put option and then *sell* it later, to close the position? (same when selling Options, but I don't intend to get in that side of trading). Is that why option decay affect the profits?

In reality, most options positions that are ever opened are never exercised.  They are closed before expiration.\n\nPresuming that you can predict prices well enough to make money trading long options, your goal when buying a long option is to sell it for a profit--just like your goal in buying a share of stock.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Is option trading more \"orderly\" compared to pure, almost unpredictable moves of underlying?

Price comes from the market, and then the greeks explain how that price got to be what it is, not the other way around.\n\n> Going long options benefits from Delta and Vega, but Theta ensures options decay to zero time value.\n\nCorrect.\n\n> It seems like options are only going to be profitable (when one is long options) if volatility remains high enough (and hopefully in the direction we want).\n\nMostly correct. There are two related components:\n\n* The market's estimate of the value of the contract at time T0 is realized at later time T1 within an acceptable range.\n\n* The market's estimate of volatility of the underlying at time T0 is realized at later time T1 within an acceptable range.\n\nIf the market overestimates volatility at T0, you could end up overpaying for volatility that is never realized at T1. Likewise, if the market underestimates volatility at T0, you could end up underpaying (and thus getting a killer deal) for volatility that is realized at T1.\n\nAnd then the connection between price and volatility is that a certain amount of volatility is required to hit a range of prices. If your target price on the underlying is +20%, but the volatility only realizes a +/-10% range, you're never going to hit that price range target.\n\n> Short option positions are a whole another matter that seems more dangerous for me, right now. \n\nOnly because you are early in your learning.

Did you mean $10 as in $0.10 as the quoted price, or did you mean $10 as the quoted price?

If you make the expiration price be 120 instead of 110, then it's a more clear example of how the ITM parity value as a gain is equal to the exercise value as a gain.

It's easier to do that and makes ppl feel better about themselves. No one likes to see a wealthy successful young socially-awkward gigabrain keep winning and getting richer.  Makes you feel bad about yourself. \n\nBut if you look at what FB did and think that it was a one hit wonder product that gave people _what they want_ I think that's overlooking the reality.  FB created a shiny object that ppl either wanted, didn't know they wanted until they got it, or didn't want but had to get it anyway to feel relevant among their peers.  What amazes me though, is that FB wasn't even the dang product! \n\nZuckerberg was already thinking 5 years into the future.  He would be collecting valuable, verifiable, cross-referenced, personal identifying data from millions/billions of people spanning the globe FOR ABSOLUTELY FKIN FREE.  Data with which he could do whatever tf he wanted to, such as sell it back to us in the ad-supported products we've all purchased in the last 10 years. \n\nWith VR AR Occulus he's doing the same thing.  In the sense that he's already 5 years in the future, brought to the present, getting the jump on everyone else.  Hell, Occulus shouldn't even be on the market- it's clunky, slow, poor graphics (which makes 100% sense as to why, but that's for another post), and participants don't even have legs yet.  \n\nBut the genius is that he KNOWS THIS.  He's getting real world feedback on prototypes-- I mean on \"consumer ready edge of the metaverse products\".   This way, by the time the tech catches up to his vision, he'll be right there with a platform to stick it into. \n\nThe headsets will be smaller, lighter, maybe not even \"headsets\", and will blend immersive VR with AR of the real world.  People think he expects us to REPLACE going for a walk with VR from your couch.  No. He knows we will augment our day to day with AR/VR just like we do staring at our smartphones 24 hours a day.  \n\nThe human element is astonishing too.  Our brains simultaneously believe and accept VR immersion while at the same time know full well it's not real or a replacement or a source of actual danger.  \n\nWhen humans look down railroad tracks we see what begins as 2 parallel lines that somehow converge to a point off in the distance.  Our eyes tell us emphatically that those two rails are  not parallel.  But our brains accept the illusion because we know what the reality it.  It reconciles the paradox for us perfectly.  \nThis is why AR/VR is the next logical step from us staring at 2D screens while our brains reconcile the illusion of 3D images they portray.  We will up the anty with immersive visuals and our brain won't hesitate for a second to both accept it as real and reconcile it as not real at the same time.  \n\nAnd just like boomers tell their grandkids \"you're gonna go blind staring at those screens all day! Get outside and go for a walk! \" , we will one day be yelling at our grandkids the same shit about VR/AR.  And we will each find some kind of balance between the two and function just fine as always. \n\nZuckerberg knows this.  He ain't no slouch.  He has the vision.

Having the ability to go long or short will be your best option.  If you have a cash account, you can apply for an option account and this will give you the ability to make money whether the stock moves up or down. To learn more about options watch some free videos. Options allow you to buy the stock at a much cheaper price. Example: Lets say the option price for Amazon is $2.50. You have to buy 100 shares@ $2.50 which is a total cost of $250 for 1 contract. Now you hold 100 shares of AMZN. This can be a quicker way to make money and of course lose money if you don't know what you are doing. Learn how to close your order if need be. You can watch free videos to learn. \n\nTo simplify the answer to your questions in my opinion:\n\nRead some news on each company. See where the company is at on the 1min chart and the 1y:1D chart. Make your decision off which seems like the better company to you. Also, check out what others are bullish on.\n\nI personally will be watching both tomorrow.\n\nYou may also consider looking at less expensive stocks that could give you a larger return due to the fact you can buy more shares from those companies. Look at where the stock has been relative to where it is now and see if it has upward potential. The saying buy low and sell high is relevant. \n\nSince you are looking at the Meta and AMZN.

Over the course of a year, $1.50/day more for eating a healthy diet would increase food costs for one person by about $550 per year. This would represent a real burden for some families, and we need policies to help offset these costs. On the other hand, this price difference is very small in comparison to the economic costs of diet-related chronic diseases, which would be dramatically reduced by healthy diets.”\n\nThat study is probably out of date now, but it’s an actual piece of evidence, not just the nonsense you’re spouting.\n\nAnd in a real pinch, calories are all that matter.

People have to eat\n\nIndeed. I have a few additional theories though.\n\nHowever unlike say Target/Kroger/various regional supermarket chains/whole paycheck, Walmart will bend over backwards (generally) to get the lowest possible price for their customers without breaking the internal 10-15% net profit margin (which is tens of billions every year btw). The raw profit margin for most grocery stores is 50+% (source: me, worked at a warehouse distributor in the office that sold to supermarkets), and certain places (read: most regional chains) have been pressing their luck during the pandemic to jack up prices since 2020.\n\nThe US government+both parties love the concept of Walmart - a private company that operates in every state, is available to 90+% of the population within 5 miles (by aerial distance, lol), republicans love that it hates unions, it's cheap, good enough for army work, no coupons or memberships and run by ruthless businessmen that have no problems telling anyone and everyone to fuck off. For example, the recent deal with Walmart providing low cost insulin is fucking huge and almost assuredly involves grants+kickbacks from the feds to the manufacturers+Walmart, but lol it keeps 30+ million people alive and spending money on necessities so the US gov is going to like that.\n\nThe people that determine inflation numbers in the US (I forgot if it's BLS or someone else) love to use the bullshit price-parity model which says that if the actual price increases but the effectiveness/feature set increases, the cost per made up unit of good enough goes down, and it assumes that there's always a new mid tier product that meets their artificial good enough feature set/literally everyone always buys used. This means that Walmart, by definition, because it targets the lower middle class consumer almost exclusively, will always seem like a good deal in comparison to anything else. Dollar stores prey on people's inability to buy in bulk, Sam's Club is literally Walmart in a different form, Costco might as well be a religious cult, and every other bulk supplier (looking at you, BJ's) AFAIK has jacked up prices grocery store style. I hate the price-parity model because 1) it doesn't reflect actual purchasing patterns in real time, 2) it assumes functional products exist that may not literally exist 3) it's a political tool used to show inflation is lower/purchasing power is much higher than reality.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Poor people shop at Walmart (as well as wealthy and middle class).

They had a strong philosophy of selling local and/or organic foods including their own brand, 365. For years (decades) before Amazon, they had the highest quality but also highest priced produce. Many flocked to Whole Foods for their beautiful and healthy prepared foods including by the ounce conscious and hot “salad bars.” You could find every kind of veggie, wine grains and even things like baked salmon. \nDepending on the store, you could find a smoothie bar featuring House made kombucha, a pizza bar, a sandwich Station and People massing you burritos with no extra fees for things like guacamole or vegan cheese. Many Whole Foods have cafes, and bakeries. Organic and “green” brands are plentiful as well as vegan products. \nI like many health-conscious foodies shopped there exclusively for years, and the vibe was great. \nThen came Bezos. \nImmediately the vibe changed. Fewer employees per shift and the level of service in every department suffered. One could go to the vitamin aisle and engage in an enlightened convo for 30 minutes and no there’s just overpriced products. Burrito bars -my favorite- were discontinued and any more expensive item like salmon disappeared from buffet bars. \nAmazon’s ship entering culture clashes with but local and enjoy the amazing experience while dining Right in your local While Foods. \nI stopped going to all of our local stores.

That store had FIVE mini restaurants fully contained within: BBQ, seafood, wine bar, etc. I cannot imagine how a greedy monopolizer who’s single-handedly killing brick and mortar retail was ever going to “improve” Whole Foods. I’ve moved on and not looking back. Amazon is evil. They’ve killed electronic stores m, book stores and record stores… places where enthusiasts used to gather. They’re killing mom and pop stores.  Their prices are already ridiculous high… don’t be fooled into thinking you are really comparison (price) shopping on their site. \nP.s. meantime farmers markets have flourished and literally every grocery chain offers significant organic foods.
