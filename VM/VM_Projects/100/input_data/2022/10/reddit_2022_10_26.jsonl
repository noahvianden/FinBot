Could you elaborate a bit more, I‚Äôve never seen anyone point this out.\n\nMargins getting squeezed by demand is not much a risk to tesla compared to the rest of the industry where some are not even profitable and legacy still has half the margins Tesla does..\n\nPrice cut was to stimulate demand, which has fallen everywhere in China. And it worked perfectly, the site crashed due to to much traffic trying to buy a Tesla.\n\nBut yea, if tesla does not make a ~30k vehicle they‚Äôll start losing possible customers left and right when someone makes a decent one. I see this as an actual risk to their short term business model. \n\nAs for adding costs, last Q was a good example of this. They‚Äôre currently scaling two new factories, very different from a whole new line but still a good example. These new factories as Elon puts it are money furnaces, yet they‚Äôre already making cars profitably. Compare this to Nevada or even Shanghai and you can see tesla is learning fast. So when they do build another factory and ramp the 30k model, it will most likely be profitable rather fast. A great example will be watching Semi and CT enter production (although the new model will be far less complicated than CT or Semi) and watching how fast they become profitable.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Tesla has been extremely lagging in the IP field.  They have been filing on average only about 300 applications a year, while others such as Ford, GM and Honda for instance file over 10-20 times as many applications (these are worldwide numbers, not just US).  \n\nA large patent portfolio is as much a defense as it is an offensive strategy.  Most companies just cross-license with each other and call it a day, but that's because they each have a sizable patent war chest.  Tesla isn't building this war chest, so either they'll end up paying some hefty licensing fees or risk being sued and having an injunction placed on one or more of their vehicles (this prevents that vehicle from being sold in that jurisdiction).  \n\nNow keep in mind a judge can grant an injunction while the infringement case is pending.  So just the threat of this can be used to essentially extort very nice licensing fees.  This type of tactic usually isn't used when both sides have similar patent war chest, as the other side will just counter sue, because it's highly likely that both sides are infringing on each other, and they just end up shaking hands and doing a cross-licensing deal.\n\nHowever Tesla can't enact such a strategy because it doesn't have an equal amount of patents to bring to the table to force a deal.  This makes them very vulnerable to infringement suits from all the other major auto and battery manufacturers.  Once other manufacturers have EV cars on the market it becomes a lot more lucrative to shut down Tesla this way.  \n\nThe risk of this happening is definitely not priced in.  The chance that other auto/battery manufacturers end up suing Tesla or forcing them into costly patent licenses is pretty high.  As Elon thinks \"patents are for the weak\", I don't see them properly investing in an IP portfolio anytime soon, and it's only a matter of time before they are seen as a juicy target.  \n\nSource: I do IP stuff for a living.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "The rate of innovation at Tesla is non-stop.

Companies with large enough armies might have little border skirmishes every now and again, but mostly just call a truce as it wouldnt be advantageous to either side to fight it out.

{"title": "Meta earnings are out - Here are the numbers", "selftext": "Facebook parent [Meta](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/META/) reported earnings after the bell. Here are the results.\n\nEarnings per share (EPS): $1.64 vs $1.89 expected, according to Refinitiv\n\nRevenue: 27.71 billion vs. $27.38 billion expected, according to Refinitiv\n\n**Wall Street is also watching other key numbers in the report:**\n\nDaily Active Users (DAUs): 1.98 billion vs 1.98 billion expected, according to StreetAccount\n\nMonthly Active Users (MAUs): 2.96 billion vs 2.94 billion expected, according to StreetAccount\n\nAverage Revenue per User (ARPU): $9.32 expected, according to StreetAccount\n\nFacebook‚Äôs parent is contending with a broad slowdown in online ad spending, challenges from [Apple‚Äôs](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL/) iOS privacy update and increased competition from TikTok. Add it up, and Meta is expected to post its second straight quarter of [declining sales](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/27/facebook-parent-meta-earnings-q2-2022.html).\n\nAlthough Meta is investing heavily in its Reels short-video service to steer users away from TikTok, the product is in the early days of generating revenue and isn‚Äôt as lucrative as Facebook‚Äôs core features, like Stories and the newsfeed.\n\nMeta is trying to make Reels more attractive to advertisers and has announced new ad formats intended to give businesses enhanced options for promoting their products through short videos. The company also recently [debuted](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/04/facebook-is-selling-ads-in-new-places-on-instagram-and-whatsapp-.html) new ways for companies to advertise on Instagram and Messenger, padding its overall ad inventory, which could potentially bolster overall sales.\n\nStill, the stock is down 62% for the year, more than double the drop in the Nasdaq, and analysts are skeptical of the company‚Äôs prospects through this year and into 2023.\n\nBank of America recently downgraded Meta from buy to neutral and said in a research [note](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/24/bank-of-america-downgrades-meta-says-lower-ad-spending-could-hurt-reels.html) that ‚Äúwe expect advertiser budget cuts in early 2023 to weigh on sentiment and drive added uncertainty‚Äù following the Apple update and the ‚ÄúReels transition.‚Äù The firm said it expects 4% growth in 2023, below Wall Street estimates of 9%, and sees ‚Äúsome downside risk to our estimates in a recession.‚Äù\n\nInvestors will also be focused on Meta‚Äôs user numbers, which have stagnated. Most concerning are the user figures in the U.S. and Canada, its biggest region for revenue. ¬†\n\nIn the second quarter of 2022, Meta counted 197 million daily active users in those two North American countries, down from 198 million in the same quarter in 2020.\n\nMeanwhile, Meta is investing billions of dollars a year into the metaverse, the yet-to-be developed digital universe that people can access with virtual reality and augmented reality headsets.\n\nEarlier this week, Meta shareholder Brad Gerstner of Altimeter Capital wrote an open [letter](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/24/altimeter-capitals-brad-gerstner-calls-on-meta-to-slash-headcount.html) to Meta, lambasting the company for employing too many workers and spending too much money on the metaverse.\n\nThe firm recommends that Meta reduce its head count by 20% and trim its metaverse investment to a maximum of $5 billion a year. Meta‚Äôs Reality Labs unit [lost](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/02/meta-reality-labs-reports-10-billion-loss.html) more than $10 billion in 2021.\n\n‚ÄúMeta needs to re-build confidence with investors, employees and the tech community in order to attract, inspire, and retain the best people in the world,‚Äù Gerstner wrote in the letter. ‚ÄúIn short, Meta needs to get fit and focused.‚Äù\n\nOn Tuesday, [Alphabet](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GOOGL/) reported weaker-than-expected results and said [YouTube advertising revenue](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/25/youtube-shrinking-ad-business-ominous-sign-for-online-ad-market.html) dropped 2% from a year earlier to $7.07 billion in the third quarter. Ruth Porat, Alphabet‚Äôs chief financial officer, said the decline ‚Äúprimarily reflects further pullbacks in advertiser spends.‚Äù\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/26/facebook-parent-meta-earnings-q3-2022.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/26/facebook-parent-meta-earnings-q3-2022.html)", "id": "ye7m0f", "created_utc": 1666815003.0, "score": 1236, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 923, "comments": [{"body": "I have 27 shares at $322 average cost fml", "score": 191, "replies": [{"body": "I have 35 shares @ $241 avg cost, we bag holding til the end now", "score": 70, "replies": [{"body": "You think we‚Äôre screwed?", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Only for the short term but the bleeding is painful", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "Whats your price target for it?

You could have easily just invested in Google instead which had the same market cap, provides more upside via Google Cloud & YouTube TV, and is less risky as Apple can‚Äôt attack their 1st party tracking. \n\nWith that said I‚Äôm seriously considering buying Facebook at these levels, it‚Äôs absurdly cheap. If you‚Äôre bagholding then I‚Äôm sorry, it sucks, it really does. This can also be a great opportunity to DCA. We know Facebook‚Äôs core business is fine. The biggest issue they have is that investors don‚Äôt like how much money is being dumped into the metaverse.

{"title": "Alphabet is not immune to the same fate as Meta.", "selftext": "Jeff Bezos once said ‚ÄúTreat Google like a mountain. You can climb the mountain, but you can‚Äôt move it.‚Äù \n\nHe said this because of how powerful Google‚Äôs moat was against its search engine competitors like Bing. His approach to Google‚Äôs moat still holds true for the next 20+ years against other search engines. However indirectly the moat can be threatened without a competeting search engine because of a growing ad space industry. \n\nAllow me to illustrate how Meta got to where it is, and why it can parallel with Alphabet. \n\nMeta has competed against so many social media sites like Tumblr, Vine and today against Tiktok which arguably is the most threatening competitor today. It‚Äôs managed to remain to the top social media company in the world with 3 billion users worldwide. It‚Äôs likely to keep the number 1 position, yet suffer the biggest financial drawdown it‚Äôs ever seen. \n\nRecently Meta has been threatened by the Apple iOS changes for user privacy, government regulation, and post 2021 the slowing demand for ad service. Probably the largest threat against Meta is itself for the pivot towards the Metaverse which is not clear if it can one done successfully. This all cultimated because its ad service business model is threatened by too many factors. \n\nIn comparison Alphabet has 4 billion users world wide for all its offered services. It‚Äôs faces similar challenges to Meta for except the threat of Apple or itself. Despite this, Alphabet investors should consider that the fate of Meta is not immune for Alphabet and in the coming decades. Just like how Apple trounced 10 billion off of Meta‚Äôs balance sheet, what if the government did the same in a larger scale for the US v. Google antitrust case. If Alphabet cannot win this case it sets a large precedent against the company and its industry handicapping its potential growth with tighter regulation.\n\nThat‚Äôs not even the worst of it! We are in a new era of advertising where every company wants to expand into ad service. Walmart and Apple recently have expanded their ad services. With more companies being added on to this list like Amazon, and Tiktok. I am aware that Tiktok or Walmart is not directly a competitor to Alphabet but in reality it‚Äôs becoming a threatening competitor as time will show. More companies can steal this market share with their services that retain user attention span and offer more efficient ad space. The Industry of ad service is stagnating revenue growth because its too competitive and it's affecting Meta equally as is Alphabet despite macroeconomic conditions. \n\nIt might be worth asking why would a company choose to advertise on Youtube or Google search if they know they can get more sales centralizing their advertisements on websites that have higher success for product sales. This could be for many reasons like they know their target audience is more reachable on XYZ website or app than a google search. Perhaps people are more likely to have an adblocker activated on a Youtube video over a top search result on a e-commerce website. \n\nIn the end Alphabet will likely be fine in the coming years. But do not think Google and Youtube is not too big to stagnate in this increasing competitive environment where everyone wants to become an ad service company. If it‚Äôs threatening enough, you will see Alphabet pivot just like Meta did to keep it‚Äôs company growing. This might mean sacrificing free cash flow.\n\nOver 80% of Google‚Äôs revenue came from advertising where as Meta had over 90% revenue from advertising. Alphabet could be the next to pivot with its centralized advertising business model.\n\nEdit: People are not reading my post right. Im not saying Google will be extinct or obselete because some other tech will surpass it. What im saying is that Alphabet in the forseeable future might pivot like Meta did because its legacy apps were not sufficient in providing long term revenue growth. Google and Youtube could face this in its growing competitive market for ad space. Will Google die? No. Can it stagnate and grow less, yes.

Not as rich, but believable. \n\nVR would be very much unlike watching a video for this reason.\n\n> While for mundane cubicle tasks it may have marginal use case, it still misses the important human aspect of body language - look up the 7/38/55 communication rule and you will see even with the addition of legs etc and photorealistic graphics human interaction in vr/ar will still be very handicapped.\n\nHow so? If you have an avatar that is as equally real looking as a person on a videocall, then you have all of the same body language, but more. Because now you have parallax depth cues, now you have the full body (instead of the upper half usually in a videocall), now you have a sense of space, natural social mirroring going on between people.\n\n> Unless there is continuous full body scanning all avatar interactions will be cartoonish and hinder communication.\n\nSee here: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w52CziLgnAc\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bS4Gf0PWmZs", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "> If FB can get full body language in the mix then it may have a chance as an office replacement and I am sure fb has employed communication experts way better than just a random reddit user like me.\n\nThe second video demonstrates that, but of course this is a tough order, as currently they do this via 8 externally placed depth sensors in a sphere around the user.

Dont get me wrong its still fucking gambling because im bidding on a result at a specific time and using spreads i dont get control over the asset.

Others are 0dte double or nothings\n Other are bidding out of the money on cheap options and allowing the market to move up to the price. Depending on the trend i may give more time but dude im risking literally about 100 bucks max a trade. Its nothing to brag about on the forum. But if you van consistently win small trades more and more frequently you can gradually step them up and win the larger ones. That can be done by just increasing the volume of contracts or the width of the spread. For me i keep it small amd tight, if i win i buy shares in something and whatever is left over from the profits gets rolled into the trading pool.

A smaller segment of this slice of the pie chart are willing to bend the rules for someone with enough provable experience. Many IT bootcamps work directly with companies seeking employees. A company will ask for 20+ qualified developers in XXX tool stack. The training company (a.k.a. school) will teach a bootcamp to 50 people and those people are all guaranteed interviews with the original company. I made up those numbers as examples, but this practice is very common. It's a great way for companies to customize the skills of applicants in their planned future projects. Cool universities offer similar assistance programs to students nearing graduation. When applying solo or through a recruiter instead of through a school, a regular part of interview processes is a hands-on coding test. Hiring agencies will vet applicants in order to give a chance to greener, self-taught developers by making them solve a few coding problems or answering highly technical questions. Presenting a degree can lead to skipping this test step as hiring agencies assume you've already passed many coding tests in school. Without a degree, they'll test you themselves. These practices are so common that LinkedIn offers their own proprietary qualifying tests which can backup your skill claims and generate attention from recruiters.

I'll never stop learning 'cause tech will never stop advancing.\n\nI recommend exactly what you are already thinking. Use a self-lead online course to prepare for a good bootcamp. A bootcamp which promises an interview or some form of career coaching is typically best. TONS of bootcamp options exist for every IT topic. Checkout a job board like Indeed or LinkedIn and search for the type of job you want. (Use the \"remote\" keyword if you want. Some remote jobs require you to live in specific territories.) Checkout the job requirements and note the key knowledges. Search for some of those topics on Coursera, Udemy, or even Google. Tons of free online learning and testing tools exist. Cross refence some of the job requirements you noticed with available courses. Always check reviews before committing to any paid course! For example, learning tools like SQL, R, or Tableau online is almost guaranteed to be relevant to a data scientist roll because they're so commonly used. Unity, Blender, and Unreal Engine are all super common topics in XR development. If you want to get into visualizing data in XR, studying statistics or other related mathematics topics would help. (Full Sail University has a great Data Visualization degree program if those topics do overlap for you.) Learning these on Coursera or wherever would only help you, even if you end up being retaught the same topic in a bootcamp. You'll simply be improving that skill with more practice and review while the other student in the course are mostly learning it for the first time. Some bootcamps might only cover 90% of the specific topics you need for your desired job. The rest of the knowledge, like the specific tool or language your dream company uses, can be gained from one of these independent online means.\n\nYou can even learn how to use advanced Trading View tools and other stock tools, like creating automated trading bots or signals.
