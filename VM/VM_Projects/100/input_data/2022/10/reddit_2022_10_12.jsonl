I mean unless by devalue mean it has gained value against the yuan, the gbp, the yen, the rupee, the euro etc etc etc.\n\nNow I don’t disagree that the usd has its hand in this global inflation and the petro dollar doesn’t help especially when the usd is gaining strength against a basket of currencies. Further exacerbating the problem is the rush for dollars and us securities as collateral for what was previously considered stable hedges such as gilts. If ur a pensioner in the uk do u hold gbp which could possibly lose another 10% of value against the usd or dollars and or us treasuries after you sell assets to meet your margin requirements (margin is probably not the proper term but it meats the intent)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "So i think your issue is you don't have an understanding of macro economics and you don't understand the full picture of what is going on. \n\nI know you think inflation is high gas prices and expensive mortgage rates and groceries costing 20% more at the check out line. Inflation is the increase in those prices **(and this is the important part)** due to the decline in value of your money. Your personal dollar is worth less today by 8.5% as compared to last year and that is why things are more expensive. Under \"normal\" circumstances, your dollar devalues by 2% every year. Ergo, prices go up by the same \"weighted average\" per year. You personal money loses value because your government increases the supply of money every year. Greater supply means less demand. Less demand means the value goes down and you need more of it to buy the same thing from a year ago. This is what price increases are in an inflationary environment. Bottle necks and wars are not inflation. They are adding to the raising costs of goods due to inflation. \n\nThe inflation you are seeing in the US is a direct result of the devaluing of the USD. **If you can understand this point we can continue.** The USD has been devalued the most it has been in 2022 more so than any other year in history. Since 2020, the US has printed 13 trillion dollars. More USD than ever existed in history. The result of this printing was the devaluing of the USD and 8.5% inflation in prices (weighted average) you see today. The US increased their supply of money. **more supply = less demand**. The US printed more money than anyone else. The US apart from some specific euro countries (with absolutely crushing energy prices) and turkey has the highest inflation. higher than canada, higher than south america and switzerland. Higher than NZ and Australia. The US printed a shit ton of money. So your currency is devalued a shit ton. Whatever you think about inflation is likely not entirely accurate. It doesn't go further than this. The definition of inflation (forget what they talk about on tv) is this: **a general increase in prices due to a fall in the purchasing value of money.** The USD just lost a ton of purchasing power (value) in 2022. Get it? It is literally what inflation is. It is literally what we are all talking about. The USD just got decimated in terms of monetary value. \n\nIf you're still with me. The strength of the USD is at a high right now as compared to other currencies. This is true. We know this to be temporary though. Every two months the FOMC has been raising interest rates on the USD. **It's only raising the rate to borrow USD on US dollars.** Meaning CAD and the EURO as example are not raising rates as much nor as fast. **The effect of the raising of the interest rates on USD has not been felt yet around the world but it's coming and coming fast.** Janet Yellen just said that she is alarmed by the lack of treasury notes being sold. yeah, no shit. Why would anyone want a USD. It just got devalued due to excessive printing but you're also making it expensive with your rate hikes. **Who wants to pay more for less value?** What this means is the globe (countries) is no longer buying USD as an investment and many of them are no longer buying them for future remittances. Do you get this? There is so much USD floating around right now, it's perceived to be worth less. Now, the USD is the reserve currency so it has a special status. We need it to pay for oil and debt across the world. But JPow is making it way more expensive to buy a dollar these days...right? he's raising the interest on the borrowing of those dollars every month. **What this is doing is costing other countries tons of money to transact in USD and it is causing a huge shock due to the speed.** Remember that most countries don't just invent (print) money out of thin air when needed. It means that the USD is both over abundant AND super expensive at the same time. It means that the most basic economic rules of supply and demand are out of whack at the moment. This needs to be corrected or the entire globe can fall into a deep deep economic crisis. So, how does it get corrected? Well, there is only so much debt and pain another country can take. Countries service their debt by buying US treasury notes (among other things). Given that new treasury notes are so expensive they cannot be used, countries will have no choice but to dip into their reserves to service their debt in USD. This will flood the market with even MORE USD and as we know, **more supply means even less demand**. As countries are currently NOT buying USD and have all the reason in the world to continue to stop buying USD, the price of the dollar will be devalued even further. **The demand goes down, so does the price.** \n\nThis is not theory. This is not my opinion. This is how it works. It's happening as we speak and will continue to happen. One thing is for sure, in a fiat system of dollars, there is no mechanism to restrict the effects of supply and demand. \n\nI tried my best to give you a grade 9 economics lesson in a reddit comment. hope it helps. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* The currency issue is this. Other countries are dealing with pretty bad situations with relation to their economies and their debt. The US has not started in earnest to deal with its problems at this point.

And right now I think it's absolutely reasonable to be checking our assumptions about \"stocks go up\" and maybe start lowering our price targets a bit.  Does that mean it's a bad time to buy?  Not necessarily, personally I think there's some good deals right now.\n\nBut I don't think there's some magic formula that says greedy is always a bad time to buy and fearful is always a good time.  It's not written into the fabric of the universe.  People get greedy for a reason.  They get fearful for a reason.  And the whole Buffet thing also is a little survivorship bias, I certainly would have loved to have started investing in the US in the last century.

{"title": "Fed officials expect higher rates to stay in place, meeting minutes show", "selftext": "Federal Reserve officials have been surprised at the pace of inflation and indicated at their last meeting that they expect higher interest rates to remain in place until prices come down, according to minutes released Wednesday from the central bank’s September meeting.\n\nIn discussions leading up to a 0.75 percentage point rate hike, policymakers noted that inflation is especially taking its toll on lower-income Americans.\n\nThey reiterated rate hikes are likely to continue and higher rates prevail until the problem is showing signs of resolving.\n\n“Participants judged that the Committee needed to move to, and then maintain, a more restrictive policy stance in order to meet the Committee’s legislative mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability,” the meeting summary stated.\n\nOfficials further noted that with inflation “showing little sign so far of abating … they had raised their assessment of the path of the federal funds rate that would likely be needed to achieve the Committee’s goals.“\n\nThe meeting happened ahead of a recent flow of data showing that inflation pressures do remain elevated, though not at the pace they were earlier this year. The Fed’s preferred inflation gauge of consumer price expenditures rose 6.2% from a year ago – 4.9% excluding food and energy – in August, according to data last week that was well above the central bank’s 2% target.\n\nA report Wednesday showed producer prices rose 0.4% in September.\n\n“Participants observed that inflation remained unacceptably high and well above the Committee’s longer-run goal of 2 percent,” the minutes said. “Participants commented that recent inflation data generally had come in above expectations and that, correspondingly, inflation was declining more slowly than they had previously been anticipating.“\n\nMembers of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee noted at the meeting that the economy needs to slow to get inflation to cool. They lowered their projections for the economy, expecting GDP to grow at just a 0.2% annualized pace in 2022 and just 1.2% in 2023, well below trend and big drop from 2021, which saw the strongest gains since 1984.\n\nThey said inflation was being driven by supply chain problems that were not limited to goods but also stressed to a shortage of labor.\n\nHowever, officials also expressed optimism that policy would help loosen the labor market and bring down prices. Officials have said lately they don’t expect rates to stay high until inflation comes all the way down to 2%.\n\n“Participants judged that inflation pressures would gradually recede in coming years,” the summary said.\n\nThe meeting concluded with the FOMC approving its third consecutive 0.75 percentage point increase, taking benchmark rates to a range of 3%-3.25%. Markets widely expect a similar-size increase to be approved at the next meeting in early November.\n\nOfficials did note that they see a point coming when the pace of rate hikes at least will decelerate, though they did not put a time frame on when that will happen.\n\nThe minutes said FOMC members noted it “would become appropriate at some point to slow the pace of policy rate increases while assessing the effects of cumulative policy adjustments on economic activity and inflation.“\n\nThey said that time would come after the fed funds rate had “reached a sufficiently restrictive level,” after which “it likely would be appropriate to maintain that level for some time until there was compelling evidence that inflation was on course to return to the 2 percent objective.“\n\nThe summary of economic projections at the meeting pointed to a “terminal rate,” or end point of rate increases to be around 4.6%. Markets expect the Fed to hike into early 2023 then keep rates there through the year.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/12/fed-minutes-october-2022.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/12/fed-minutes-october-2022.html)", "id": "y2azgl", "created_utc": 1665598099.0, "score": 1530, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 392, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 643, "replies": [{"body": "Wasn’t it transitory?!?! /s", "score": 266, "replies": [{"body": "Well if you're the type of investor who puts your ROIs 20 years out on average, sure it's tranistory!

It doesn't reduce the capital base (equity) of the Fed either, which is obviously nonsensical.  The implications of a government that can spend infinitely, never paying anyone back are enormous.  It will lead to hyper-inflation, currency devaluation and it is completely unsustainable.  Fed knows this which is why they are embarking on QT.\n\nIf the Fed were simply operating at paper losses for the first time ever, that'd be okay.  But it actually isn't just that, it's actual payments of cash that need to be made to sustain interest rates (you really should read my link above and the floor system vs. corridor system).\n\nttps://old.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/y0ztz5/people_who_arent_dcaing_into_the_market_right_now/irw9vd8/", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "Higher rates means more money out of people’s pockets every month on consumer debt.
