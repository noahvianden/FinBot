But the reason for that is because the typical person trading covered calls may already have 10's or 100's of thousands of dollars of shares already invested and now wants to add covered calls to those shares. Since they already have a large trading account and clearly have a lot of trading experience to have gotten to that point, making the lowest approval level accommodate those kinds of traders makes sense.\n\nThe best beginner's option play is a paper trading account with $1000 of play money, or whatever amount of real money you will actually start with. NOTE: Paper trading platforms, like TDA/tos may start you out with $50k or more, so the first thing you should do is downsize your account to the size you will actually trade. Use the balance (like $49,000) to buy MINT or NEAR shares, so you don't have a giant loss against your account P/L, and just set those shares aside and don't touch them. \n\nFor real money, a single long call or long put that is no more than 5% of your total real cash is a great way to start. Like if you have $1000, find an OTM long call that only costs $50 on a solid blue chip stock like Apple or Home Depot. There are plenty to choose from. The probability that you will make money is very low, but hey, you are a beginner and beginner's learn while losing money.\n\nFinally, if you are approved to trade spreads, $1-wide credit or debit spreads are a great defined-risk way to start trading. A $1 spread never has more than $100 of risk of loss (assuming you close well before expiration), and is often much less than $100. Like a credit spread typically has no more than $65 of risk and a debit spread no more than $50 of risk. The lower the risk, the better the spread. The great thing about spreads is that you can trade *any* stock or fund that has $1 strike intervals for an affordable price, but with a much higher probability of profit than a cheap OTM call or put. That includes Apple.\n\nEDIT: I noticed that a lot of other replies recommended CSPs. To me, CSPs have exactly the same problem of CCs, too expensive.

For example, in the beginning of the 2000s, the largest inflows to stock mutual funds were in early 2000 while the largest outflows were in mid-2002. These mutual fund flows were near the start of a significant bear (downtrending) market and bull (uptrending) market respectively. A similar pattern is repeated near the end of the decade.[12][13][14][15][16]\n\n> This mutual fund flow data seems to indicate that most investors (despite what they may say) actually follow a buy-high, sell-low strategy.[17][18] Studies confirm that the general tendency of investors is to buy after a stock or mutual fund price has increased.[19] This surge in the number of buyers may then drive the price even higher. However, eventually, the supply of buyers becomes exhausted, and the demand for the stock declines and the stock or fund price also declines. After inflows, there may be a short-term boost in return, but the significant result is that the return over a longer time is disappointing.[19]\n\ni feel this applies aptly here. we're definitionally in a bear market, 25% off all time highs and more people are selling than buying. they'll find reasons why now isn't a good time to buy. and they'll wait for \"things to start looking up\" or \"the economy to not be in the shitter\" or whatever they say, and then they'll buy when stocks are high again.", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "Just to point out, folks might not be dumb, they just might not have the luxury of choice.

If you trade stocks with the idea that it is money you need within 6 years you’re a fool. \n\nThere’s no point comparing this to the Great Depression either, for obvious reasons IE 24% unemployment and stocks falling 90%. But also, if you look at the charts from that era I think if you were uninvested/sold quickly enough when it fell 90% by 1933, didn’t lose your job or get scared out of investing, and then started DCAing in at the lows you’d have 4x’d your money by 1936. Rich people always make money buying the bottom. \n\nFrom 1966-1982, the Dow went sideways for sure, but the S&P actually had a 6.8%/year annual return. Three quarters of that performance came from dividend returns. Anyway, the big picture from that era is actually the incredible wage growth that would happen in those decades. Median American household income was $6900 in 1966. If the average person puts aside 15% for retirement then they could only have $1000 set aside per year. By 1982, the median income would be $23k and 15% would mean they could park $3.4k a year in the market(Nearly $10k in today dollars). It’s good to keep in mind that the market is just a place for most people to park their savings, so if you have more money you can tuck away the better your portfolio will eventually look. \n\n(Source: [https://awealthofcommonsense.com/2014/06/1966-1982-stock-market-really-bad/](https://awealthofcommonsense.com/2014/06/1966-1982-stock-market-really-bad/) \n)", "score": 0, "replies": []}, {"body": "Your “green” comment is probably true - OP is 20 years old", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I think the difference here is that more people are able to invest with technology.

By moving away from wave deliveries to even mix of deliveries throughout the quarter, Tesla will naturally have more units in transit at EOQ. It's just a shift in delivery schedule to reduce costs. It may make results look bad this quarter, but it'll be better going forward both in terms of company financials and delivery expectations.

By mid-99 people had started talking about insane tech valuations, and how 20 somethings were raking in millions while running their companies out of their 1 bedroom apartments in San Francisco etc , its just that internet was so new that many people did not understand anything about these new-age tech companies or how to put a value on them. Anything with a html site ending with .com was being marketed as a \"tech\" company that demanded multi-million dollar valuation. The market as i remember had started to correct much before Mar 2000, its just that by Mar 2000 we saw Cisco, IBM, Microsoft etc begin to go down.

It spread to other sectors mostly because of a nasty election followed by huge corporate fraud cases and ofcourse 9/11 and war on terror. As someone in tech, i always thought the 2000-2003 downturn in tech was more brutal than the one between 2008-2011. It also did not help that it was during this time that tech and non-tech companies first began outsourcing tech jobs offshore.\n\nIn 2007 no one except home buyers noticed the bubble conditions . Everyone thought things were great until the infamous Citibank Q3 call in 2007. Yet there was no panic, companies were still hiring, recession or bubble talk wasn't even part of the normal vocabulary unlike today.  I remember by March of 2008 things were starting to get noticeably worse. So many around me in my office and my circle of friends were getting laid off and were finding it hard to find jobs ( i would eventually get laid off in 2011).  Still there was no talk of bubble or recession, but sometime late that summer the media started screaming about \"banking crisis\", and then Lehmann Brothers happened and then the news about Wachovia, Merill Lynch, AIG etc. Citibank, which not so long ago was one of the biggest companies in the world by market share was reduced to $1/share. It quickly spread to every sector except healthcare. By October it felt as if the whole world was about to collapse. I will never forget the line outside a local Barnes and Noble bookstore in my neighborhood with middle aged men and women dressed in their Sunday best waiting to apply for salesperson jobs that had opened up ! So many folks in their 40s and 50s were working in sandwich and coffee shops that otherwise was manned by 20 somethings. It wasn't until late 2011 that things started improving. I firmly believe the feds should have stopped QE and begun increasing interest rates meaningfully from late 2013, unfortunately they did not take the foot off the gas until 2018 leading to another asset bubble we face today.\n\nAlthough for me 1999-2000 or 2008-09 feels like just yesterday, things were a lot different then.  Social media and outrage factories like facebook/twitter gives us space to explore all possibilities, and maybe that's we hear about bubbles, recession, crash etc so frequently now than we did back then.

I'm sure you know more than most that materials have skyrocketed the last couple of years which makes houses more expensive to build. Interest rates are rising, which means monthly payments will increase on the same overall loan value, that reduces the number of people who can afford that home.

If they have lots of money it's easier for them to borrow more, and they are probably less concerned about a recession and will be spending until the last moment.
