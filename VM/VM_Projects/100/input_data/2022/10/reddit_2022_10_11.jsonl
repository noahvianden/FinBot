{"title": "Semiconductor route wipes out $240 Billion from chipmakers - TSMC drops 8.3% and Samsung and Tokyo Electron also declined.", "selftext": "Asia’s top chip stocks tumbled Tuesday, ensnared in an escalating US-China tech race that has erased more than $240 billion from the sector’s global market value.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world’s largest contract chipmaker, plunged a record 8.3% while Samsung Electronics Co. and Tokyo Electron Ltd. also declined.  The selloff spread to the foreign-exchange market as investors tallied up the damage from the sweeping curbs the US is imposing on companies that conduct technology business with China.\n\nThe Biden administration measures erect barriers of entry to China’s market by limiting the ability of US firms to sell equipment and tech to their Chinese counterparts. There are concerns that the restrictions could spread if Washington widens the initiative to include other countries, while questions also remain over the scope and final impact of the moves.\n\nThe US announced the export curbs Friday, and there have been suggestions that similar actions may be deployed in other countries to ensure international cooperation. The announcement spurred a two-day rout of over 9% in the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index that saw it close Monday at its lowest level since November 2020. Markets in Korea, Japan and Taiwan were shut that day for holidays. \n\nThe US measures include restrictions on the export of some types of chips used in artificial intelligence and supercomputing, and also tighter rules on the sale of semiconductor equipment to any Chinese company. Washington also added more Chinese firms to a list of companies that it regards as “unverified,” which means US suppliers will face new hurdles in selling technologies to those entities. \n\n “It is difficult to call a bottom on the performance of the chip sector,” said Gary Dugan, chief executive officer of the Global CIO Office. “The big story is that the West is becoming profoundly more concerned about security around any form of technology. We see no reason to re-enter the sector for the moment despite the profound poor performance.” \n\nUS chip stocks were on track to decline for a third day, with Nvidia Corp., Advanced Micro Devices Inc., Qualcomm Inc. and Texas Instruments Inc. all down more than 1% before the bell. Chip-tool maker ASML Holding NV traded down 2.3% in Amsterdam, bringing three-day losses to more than 11%. \n\nFull Article:  [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-11/chip-stocks-fall-across-asia-as-japan-korea-return-from-holiday](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-11/chip-stocks-fall-across-asia-as-japan-korea-return-from-holiday?srnd=premium-asia)\n\n***Buying opportunity or too early?

I know many people hate Elon nowadays, but he's done more for climate change than any other person out there.\n\nSo what we should fight for is more investment by the government for research and subsidies that make the green alternatives competitive (the IRA is a great start, but we need more).

EVs are about 3x more efficient in terms of getting the generated electric power to the motor. For personal transportation, EVs are the answer hands down.\n\nAs far as lithium, the mining can be done in an environmentally conscious way, just like any other type of mining. The US currently only has one mine, but will have new ones coming online in the near future. China is not the leader in lithium production, Australia produces the most, by far. China is the leader in creating lithium batteries, which I do think is a problem, but one that we can address.

The money supply produced per household and firm was more than was required to support the product base that became available. \n\nSimply put, the Fed acted too timidly. \n\nThat increased inflation which destroys the value of fixed contracts like bonds. The price for bonds fall increasing the yield for future buyers. At some point they may even be more attractive than stocks. So stock prices fall from that effect. \n\nHowever, as firms adapt to inflation they may find their income inflated as well. That increases the amount available for dividends, paying down debt, reinvesting in the company and stock buybacks. In that case, prices in the future will rise. They may even increase now if investors correctly identify firms that should be positively impacted by inflation. \n\nCompanies do not have the power to control inflation so their managers should not try to do so.

{"title": "Bank of England's Bailey to Pension Funds: 'You've Got Three Days Left; You've Got to Get This Done' -WSJ", "selftext": "**In case you are wondering why the market too a sharp turn down around 2:40 PM ET**\n\nSource: https://www.wsj.com/articles/boe-adds-index-linked-gilts-to-bond-purchase-program-11665470476  \n  \nLONDON—The Bank of England extended support targeted at pension funds for the second day in a row, the latest attempt to contain a bond-market selloff that has threatened U.K. financial stability.\n\nThe central bank on Tuesday said it would add inflation-linked government bonds to its program of long-dated bond purchases, after an attempt on Monday to help pension funds failed to calm markets.\n\n“Dysfunction in this market, and the prospect of self-reinforcing ‘fire sale’ dynamics pose a material risk to U.K. financial stability,” the BOE said.\n\nThe yield on a 30-year U.K. inflation-linked bond has soared above 1.5% this week, up from 0.851% on Oct. 7, according to Tradeweb. Just weeks ago, the yield on the gilt, as U.K. government bonds are known, was negative. Because yields rise as prices fall, the effect has been punishing losses for bond investors.\n\nOn Tuesday, after the BOE expanded the purchases, the yield on inflation-linked gilts held mostly steady but at the new, elevated levels. The central bank said it bought roughly £2 billion, equivalent to about $2.21 billion, in inflation-linked gilts, out of a £5 billion daily capacity.\n\nThe bank’s bond purchases, however, are meant to run out on Friday. The Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association, a trade body that represents the pension industry, urged the central bank on Tuesday to extend its purchases until the end of the month.\n\nThe near-daily expansion of the Bank of England’s rescue plan highlighted the challenges facing central banks in stamping out problems fueled by a once-in-a-generation increase in inflation and interest rates. It also raised questions about whether the BOE was providing the right medicine to address the problem.\n\nThe turmoil sparked fresh demands on Monday for pension funds to come up with cash to shore up LDIs, or liability-driven investments, derivative-based strategies that were meant to help match the money they owe to retirees over the long term.\n\nLDIs were at the root of the bond selloff that prompted the BOE’s original intervention. Pension plans in late September saw a wave of margin calls after Prime Minister Liz Truss’s government announced large, debt-funded tax cuts that fueled an unprecedented bond-market selloff.\n\nThe BOE launched its original bond-purchase program on Sept. 28, but it only restored calm for a couple of days before selling resumed. An expansion of the program on Monday backfired, with yields again soaring higher.\n\nThe selloff on Monday was “very reminiscent of two weeks ago,” said Simeon Willis, chief investment officer of XPS, a company that advises pension plans.\n\nLDI strategies use leveraged financial derivatives tied to interest rates to amplify returns. The outsize moves in U.K. bond markets last month led to huge collateral calls on pensions to back up the leveraged investments. The pension funds have sold other assets, including government and corporate bonds, to meet those calls, adding to pressure on yields to rise and creating a spiral effect on markets.\n\nPensions are typically big holders of inflation-linked government bonds, which help protect the plans from both inflation and interest-rate changes. But these weren’t eligible in the BOE’s bond-buying program until Tuesday.\n\nThe U.K. helped pioneer bonds with payouts linked to inflation, sometimes referred to as linkers, in the 1980s. Linkers were originally sold exclusively to pensions, but the U.K. opened them to other investors over the years.\n\nPensions remain a dominant force in the market because the bonds offer long-term protection against both inflation and interest-rate changes. Their outsize role left the market vulnerable to shifts in pension-fund demand like that seen in recent weeks.\n\nAdam Skerry, a fund manager at Abrdn with a focus on inflation-linked government bonds, said his firm has struggled to trade those assets in recent days.\n\n“We were trying to sell some bonds this morning, and it was virtually impossible to do that,” he said. “The LDI issue that’s facing the market, the fact that the market is moving to the degree that it did, particularly yesterday, suggests that there’s still an awful lot [of selling] there.”\n\nPensions have also appeared hesitant to sell their bonds to the BOE, reflecting a mismatch in what the central bank is offering and what the market needs.\n\n“The way that the bank has structured this intervention is they can only buy assets if people put offers into them, but nobody is putting offers in,” said Craig Inches, head of rates and cash at Royal London Asset Management. He said the pension funds would rather sell their riskier assets, including corporate bonds or property.\n\nMr. Willis of XPS said many pensions want to hold on to their government bonds because it helps protect pensions against changes in interest rates, which impact the way their liabilities are valued.\n\n“If they sell gilts now, they’re doing it in the likelihood that they’ll need to buy them back in the future at some point and they might be more expensive, and that’s unhelpful,” he said.\n\nAlso plaguing the program: Pension funds are traditionally slow-moving organizations that make decisions with multidecade horizons. The market turmoil has hurtled them into the warp-speed-style moves usually reserved for traders at swashbuckling hedge funds.\n\nTo make decisions about the sale of assets, industry players describe a game of telephone playing out among trustees, investment advisers, fund managers and banks. Pension funds spread their assets among multiple managers, which are in turn held by separate custodian banks. Calling everyone for the necessary signoffs is creating a lengthy and involved process.\n\nTo give themselves more time, pension funds are pushing the BOE to extend the bond-buying program at least to the end of the month. That is when the U.K.’s Treasury chief, Kwasi Kwarteng, is expected to lay out the government’s borrowing plans for the coming year.\n\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies, a nonpartisan think tank that focuses on the budget, warned Tuesday that borrowing is likely to hit £200 billion in the financial year ending March, the third highest for a fiscal year since World War II and £100 billion higher than planned in March of this year. Increased borrowing increases the supply of bonds and generally causes bond yields to rise.\n\nMr. Kwarteng on Tuesday declared his confidence in BOE Gov. Andrew Bailey as he faced questions from lawmakers for the first time in his new job.\n\n“I speak to the governor very frequently and he is someone who is absolutely independent and is managing what is a global situation very effectively,” he said.", "id": "y1hgmv", "created_utc": 1665515321.0, "score": 675, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 179, "comments": [{"body": "this whole thing just proves i know nothing about the bond market. everything seems backwards to me.", "score": 306, "replies": [{"body": "I have learned more over the past year than ever in my 20 years of investing.\n\nThe Bond market is enormous, complicated, and opaque.

{"title": "Intel Plans to Cut Thousands of Jobs in Face of PC Slowdown", "selftext": "Intel Corp. is planning a major reduction in headcount, likely numbering in the thousands, to cut costs and cope with a sputtering personal-computer market, according to people with knowledge of the situation. \n\nThe layoffs will be announced as early as this month, with the company planning to make the move around the same time as its third-quarter earnings report on Oct. 27, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the deliberations are private. The chipmaker had 113,700 employees as of July.\n\nSome divisions, including Intel’s sales and marketing group, could see cuts affecting about 20% of staff, according to the people familiar with the situation.\n\nIntel is facing a steep decline in demand for PC processors, its main business, and has struggled to win back market share lost to rivals like Advanced Micro Devices Inc. In July, the company warned that 2022 sales would be about $11 billion lower than it previously expected. Analysts are predicting a third-quarter revenue drop of nearly 20%. And Intel’s once-enviable margins have shriveled: They’re about 15 percentage points narrower than historical numbers of around 60%. \n\nDuring its second-quarter earnings call, Intel acknowledged that it could make changes in its business to improve profits. “We are also lowering core expenses in calendar year 2022 and will look to take additional actions in the second half of the year,” Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger said at the time. \n\nIntel, based in Santa Clara, California, declined to comment on the layoffs.\n\nIntel’s last big wave of layoffs occurred in 2016, when it trimmed about 12,000 jobs, or 11% of its total. The company has made smaller cuts since then and shuttered several divisions, including its cellular modem and drone units. Like many companies in the technology industry, Intel also froze hiring earlier this year, when market conditions soured and fears of a recession grew.\n\nGelsinger took the helm at Intel last year and has been working to restore the company’s reputation as a Silicon Valley legend. But even before the PC slump, it was an uphill fight. Intel lost its long-held technological edge, and its own executives acknowledge that the company’s culture of innovation withered in recent years.\n\nNow a broader slump is adding to those challenges. Intel’s PC, data center and artificial intelligence groups are contending with a tech spending slowdown, weighing on revenue and profit.\n\nPC sales tumbled 15% in the third quarter from a year earlier, according to IDC. HP Inc., Dell Technologies Inc, and Lenovo Group Ltd., which use Intel’s processors in their laptops and desktop PCs, all suffered steep declines.\n\nIt’s a particularly awkward moment for Intel to be making cutbacks. The company lobbied heavily for a $52 billion chip-stimulus bill this year, vowing to expand its manufacturing in the US. Gelsinger is planning a building boom that includes bringing the world’s biggest chipmaking hub to Ohio. \n\nAt the same time, the company is under intense pressure from investors to shore up its profits. The company’s shares have fallen more than 50% in 2022, with a 20% plunge occurring in the last month alone.\n\nUS tensions with China also have clouded the chip industry’s future. The Biden administration announced new export curbs on Friday, restricting what US technologies companies can sell to the Asian nation.\n\nDavid Zinsner, Intel’s chief financial officer, said after the company’s latest quarterly report that “there are large opportunities for Intel to improve and deliver maximum output per dollar.” The chipmaker expected to see restructuring charges in the third quarter, he said, signaling that cuts were looming.\n\nSome chipmakers, including Nvidia Corp. and Micron Technology Inc., have said they’re steering clear of layoffs for now. But other tech companies, such as Oracle Corp. and Arm Ltd., have already been cutting jobs.\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-11/intel-is-planning-thousands-of-job-cuts-in-face-of-pc-slowdown#:~:text=Intel%20Corp.%20is%20planning%20a,with%20knowledge%20of%20the%20situation", "id": "y1mjl7", "created_utc": 1665527599.0, "score": 483, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 139, "comments": [{"body": "So what I thought would be a temporary bagholding turned out to be permanent", "score": 310, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 68, "replies": [{"body": "Hyper threading for twice as many loses!", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "F12?", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Have you tried clearing the cache?", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I mean, if you look at it this way....

The cost of running 50 VM's in the cloud for only a single month will cost about the same. That same 1U server can be run for a decade or more if necessary; I still see Dell R710's in production from 2009. The cloud is not, and will never be, a way for businesses to save money or cut costs. It is nothing more than a platform for small businesses and developers to get access to highly-available compute resources without having the capex costs of redundant AC units, UPS's, and servers. It is cost effective when you are small and running a handful of VM's, but anything more and the initial capex cost savings quickly disappear in the face of inflated monthly charges. Most large businesses, which make up the bulk of revenue from azure/aws/gcp, never got rid of their on-premise data centers and have been running in a hybrid capacity.
