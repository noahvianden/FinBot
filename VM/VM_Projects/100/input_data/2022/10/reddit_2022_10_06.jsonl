{"title": "Peloton to Cut 500 More Jobs in Last Bid for Turnaround", "selftext": "Honestly, WSJ really missed the headline for this article - Their Subtitle should have been the actual title...\n\n# Peloton's  Chief Executive Barry McCarthy says company has six months to prove it can survive on its own\n\n Peloton Interactive Inc. [PTON -4.18%▼](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/PTON?mod=chiclets) said it plans to cut about 500 jobs, roughly 12% of its remaining workforce, in the company’s fourth round of layoffs this year as the connected fitness-equipment maker tries to reverse mounting losses.\n\nChief Executive Barry McCarthy, who took over in February, said he is giving the unprofitable company about another six months to significantly turn itself around and, if that fails, Peloton likely isn’t viable as a stand-alone company. \n\nThe job reductions, announced to staff on Thursday, will leave Peloton with roughly 3,800 employees globally, less than half the number of people the company employed at its peak last year. It also has eliminated about 600 more jobs since June than previously disclosed through retail store closings, attrition and other moves, Peloton said.\n\nMr. McCarthy said that the latest cuts mark Peloton’s final significant move to reduce its operating footprint and that executives would now focus on increasing revenue. He said the cuts are companywide but would be heaviest in its marketing operation, which he said is too big for a company of Peloton’s size.\n\n“There comes a point in time when we’ve either been successful or we have not,” Mr. McCarthy said in an interview.\n\n* “If we don’t grow,” he said, before pausing. “We need to grow to get the business to a sustainable level.”\n\n The company has reported six straight quarterly losses, culminating in a $1.2 billion loss in the most recent quarter. Demand for Peloton’s bikes and treadmills has plunged and the number of people who subscribe to its fitness classes has stagnated as Americans return to pre-Covid routines and, more recently, confront decades-high inflation.\n\nMr. McCarthy said he sees evidence that Peloton can succeed. \n\nHe said the company has drastically reduced the amount of cash it is burning through by cutting jobs, outsourcing all manufacturing and reducing costly unsold inventory, and isn’t at risk of running low on funds. Peloton went through more than $1.7 billion in cash in the past three quarters combined, ending June with $1.25 billion in cash reserves and a $500 million credit line.\n\nThe new management team is clicking, according to Mr. McCarthy, who said he believes Peloton’s near-term growth targets remain achievable. \n\nEmployers’ total job openings declined 10% in August and layoffs rose, providing the latest signs that the labor market, while still strong, is cooling. More companies, from Facebook owner Meta Platforms Inc. to Snap Inc. and Stanley Black & Decker Inc., are cutting jobs, while others including Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google have said they would freeze or pull back on hiring.\n\nPeloton employed about 3,700 people near the start of the pandemic, and grew to more than 8,600 in 2021 as the company scrambled to meet explosive demand, adding employees internally while acquiring equipment manufacturing operations in a bid to quickly expand capacity.\n\nPeloton in February said it would cut 2,800 jobs and replace co-founder John Foley as CEO with Mr. McCarthy, who previously was finance chief at Spotify Technology SA and Netflix Inc. In July, Peloton said it would cut about 500 Taiwan-based manufacturing jobs. A month later, it announced plans to cut 530 employees from its North American delivery workforce and 250 customer-service positions in North America. \n\n“I know many of you will feel angry, frustrated, and emotionally drained by today’s news, but please know this is a necessary step if we are going to save Peloton, and we are,” Mr. McCarthy said in an internal memo to employees provided by the company. \n\nSeparately, Peloton is exploring a sale of its Precor commercial fitness-equipment unit less than two years after acquiring the business, according to people familiar with the matter. \n\n[https://www.wsj.com/articles/peloton-to-cut-another-500-jobs-in-last-bid-for-turnaround-11665011471?st=76mfmpbr32v2wqn&reflink=desktopwebshare\\_permalink](https://www.wsj.com/articles/peloton-to-cut-another-500-jobs-in-last-bid-for-turnaround-11665011471?st=76mfmpbr32v2wqn&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink)", "id": "xx4c8b", "created_utc": 1665060225.0, "score": 1025, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 298, "comments": [{"body": "How does Peloton have over 5000 employees?!", "score": 495, "replies": [{"body": "All these fake \"tech\" companies had shit tons of workers doing likely nothing all week.

I’ve been in banking since the Great Recession and I’ve never seen anything like this. This isn’t a scenario where one asset class (RE) got out of whack and markets dipped 48% while a few Wall Street firms folded and people realized packaging trash with A paper was a bad idea. Deals starting to hit my desk are getting crushed from every direction. \n\nUsually when I see a shitty company I can usually laugh at the management team and point to exactly why their wives are divorcing them. Not anymore boys. I’m seeing demand softness across sectors. This reduced demand is resulting in price reduction (see lumber and steel). Seems good right? Wrong. Companies loaded up on expensive inventory because daddy told them to be worried about the supply chain. So now they are relieving inventory and taking huge GAAP losses. In short I’m seeing companies losing revenue and gross margin across the board. \n\nBut wait….there’s more! Interest rates are up. Now people are realizing that I in EBITDA that everyone adds back to cash flow is a cash expense that’s actually paid. Weird right? Oh and Google the word inflation. Every working in America is leaving the grocery store and gas station like they just got kicked in the nuts. So what do they do?? They ask their employer for more money. In short SG&Admin expense is up across sectors. \n\nLong discussion short, put on your pampers so your wife doesn’t have to wash out skid marks when you start yourself. As an economy we’ll be fine, but we are going to see record bankruptcy filings next year (my hunch). There’s no solution for reduced revenue and margin combined with raping climbing SG&Admin unless Uncle Sam gives everyone more tendies. Luckily we can just export our way out of this. JK!

Keep interests at a level that allow for \\~2% inflation.\n\nNow, increased money supply is just one part of this inflation, called demand-pull inflation. But we also had so-called global supply shock(s). Products increased in price(= cost to the manufacturer, who passed it on) due to supply chain issues with Covid and Russia invading Ukraine.

The first is demand. This has been influenced lately by central bank (Fed) policy, ie low interest rates, that were designed to boost spending and investment (investment in the sense of building new factories, etc). This was largely as a response to the pandemic, in an effort to keep the economy from falling into recession. The demand side has also been driven by fiscal policy, ie congress has gone on a massive spending streak without raising taxes, ie spending borrowed money. This has the effect of raising demand.\n\nThe second piece of the puzzle is the supply side, which has also contributed to inflation. The pandemic disrupted a lot of industries and supply chains, and they're struggling to re-hire and ramp back up. There are also impacts from  oil problems due to war, etc.\n\n\nLong story short, governments and central banks over-reacted to the pandemic. They did a good job of sparing us the pain of a deep global economic recession, and they did this by really jacking up demand. However, as this stimulus trickles through the economy, the supply can't keep up. High demand and insufficient supply means shortages, which we saw, and shortages are followed by price increases until demand and supply balance back out. Price increases mean inflation. To unwind this inflation, the central banks have to raise interest rates, which hurts demand because it makes spending borrowed money less attractive for companies and individuals. Unfortunately, that's the price we pay. The Fed will try to strike the right balance, but their only real tool is to keep killing demand until inflation calms down, and that could mean an economic slowdown.\n\n\"Stopping printing money\" is really just economic speak for policies that reduce demand and result in less borrowing and spending in the economy. There are more complex mechanisms behind it, but they don't really matter, the end result is less demand via Fed policy, and we refer to it as \"stopping printing money\" or \"tight Fed policy\" or \"hawkish Fed policy\".\n\nAs much as it was nice for congress to just borrow and spend enormous amounts during the pandemic, the fact those dollars basically came out of thin air means that each dollar is worth less in terms of buying power, aka inflation.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you for this detailed explanation.

Many participants also noted, however, that there were some tentative signs of a softening outlook for the labor market: These signs included increases in weekly initial unemployment insurance claims, reductions in quit rates and vacancies, slower growth in payrolls than earlier in the year, and reports of cutbacks in hiring in some sectors. In addition, although nominal wage growth remained strong according to a wide range of measures, there were some signs of a leveling off or edging down. In some Districts, contacts had suggested that labor demand–supply imbalances might be diminishing, with firms being more successful in hiring and retaining workers and under less pressure to raise wages. Some participants noted that the contribution that increases in labor supply could make to reducing labor market imbalances was likely limited, especially as the scope for labor force participation to pick up was constrained by the ongoing movement of the large baby-boom cohort into their retirement years, while others highlighted factors holding down participation that could wane in the future, such as continuing pandemic-related concerns. Participants observed that, in part because of tighter financial conditions and an associated moderation in the growth of aggregate demand, growth in employment would likely slow further in the period ahead. They noted that this development would help bring labor demand and supply into better balance, reducing upward pressures on nominal wage growth and aiding the return of inflation to 2 percent. Several participants observed that the moderation in labor market conditions might well lag the slowdown in economic activity. Participants remarked that a moderation in labor market conditions would likely involve a decline in the number of job openings as well as a moderate increase in unemployment from the current very low rate.

There is a huge net increase in profit in that sector at present. \nYes, oil companies, are seeing huge record increases in profits. But those profits are not a functional price gouging. Oil companies do not set the price of oil, supply and demand does. You can't price gouge oil, because it's a easily substituted commodity.\n\nSupply shock drives the price up and not only makes oil companies huge profits, but essentially makes new oil fields viable. That is to say, it wasn't profitable to pump oil somewhere because it's tar sands, but now suddenly it is because the cost exceeds the extraction cost.   \n\n\nThe same thing is happening for refineries. There is limited refinery capacity. They produce as much as possible. The price they get a set by the open market. When the price is low, they lose money. When the price is high they make money. There's really no way for them to actively gouge prices. Right now they're making heavy profits when normally that is a loss industry.\n\nNow, Let's look at gas stations. They're the only ones who actually have the power to raise the price you pay at the pump. But they are in fact currently making less money than normal. Oil companies are getting rich. The refineries are getting rich. The gas stations are losing money. Consumers are spending a lot more. But at no point in this equation did anyone stop and say \"Let's just charge more because we can get away with it.\".
