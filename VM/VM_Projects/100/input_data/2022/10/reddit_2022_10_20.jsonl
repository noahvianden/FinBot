{"title": "Elon Musk says Tesla can surpass the combined value of Apple and Saudi Aramco, the world's 2 most valuable companies", "selftext": " \n\n* The CEO of Tesla said the EV maker's market cap could be more than Apple and Saudi Aramco combined.\n* Apple and Aramco are the world's top two companies by market capitalization.\n* The combined market cap of Aramco and Apple is six times that of Tesla, at today's stock price. \n\nElon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and the world's richest man, said on Wednesday his electric vehicle company could become more valuable than the world's two largest companies — Apple and Saudi Aramco.\n\nThe combined market capitalization of tech giant Apple and Saudi Arabian state energy giant Aramco is around $4.4 trillion today. In comparison, Tesla's market cap is about $690 billion. This means Tesla would have to grow roughly six times its current size to catch up.\n\n\"I see a potential path for Tesla to be worth more than Apple and Saudi Aramco combined,\" said Musk, according to a transcript of Tesla's earnings call on October 19. He acknowledged it'll be tough, but it can be achieved with \"a lot of work, some very creative new products, manage expansion and always the luck.\"\n\nMusk made the ambitious statement on Wednesday after Tesla reported record revenues of $21.45 billion in the third quarter of 2022 — although it fell short of the $21.96 billion analysts were estimating, per IBES data from Refinitiv. The company also posted a profit of $3.29 billion in the quarter running from July to September — just under a record profit of $3.3 billion reported in the first quarter of this year.\n\nFull article: [https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/elon-musk-tesla-surpass-combined-apple-aramco-value-earnings-profits-2022-10](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/elon-musk-tesla-surpass-combined-apple-aramco-value-earnings-profits-2022-10)\n\nElon Musk says Tesla (TSLA) can exceed the combined value of Apple (AAPL) and Saudi Aramco, which currently with combined market cap of around $4.4 trillion. While TSLA's current market cap is about $690 billion.

Only reason StarLink teamed with T-Mobile is to try to be “first” but they don’t even have a working product yet, it’s all theory!!\n\nStarLink isn’t the first satellite Internet either. It’s just the most modern. It costs a lot more to completely redo 20 year old technology versus hyping up something new. For example if Hughes Net was to advertise brand new services it wouldn’t get the same hype and therefore it’s not worth the investment.\n\nTesla is a garbage vehicle. The reason it took others so long is because gasoline is more efficient and much better overall for energy storage, it just produces too much waste. But that said, it’s pretty wasteful replacing batteries every 10 years regardless of miles, paying $20k just for that.

Specifically Connectwise, which is very weak compared to Salesforce. It simply doesn't offer the same level of granular reporting capabilities that Salesforce does, which can tell you what actions need to be taken by what team. We also utilize Hubspot, another tool being mentioned as a competitor to Salesforce in this thread which is kind of hilarious. Hubspot isn't even remotely comparable to Salesforce as a CRM. We use multiple sales engagement tools which for smaller organizations would suffice as a CRM but again, the level at which Salesforce can be customized and the granular reporting sets it apart from most CRMs. \n\n> Are there any you’re aware of that are as good or better?\n\nAt the level my company is at, no. And we're still in the SMB category. Enterprise level organizations, definitely not. Small businesses can get away with smaller or simpler CRMs but once you reach a certain threshold you need a more robust system.\n\n\nEdit: In the ERP space each major provider generally has a module dedicated to CRM but, the ones I work with very rarely use that module. I work with **a lot** of enterprise organizations utilizing Oracle's various ERP applications and Salesforce is a very regular presence. I barely see any of Oracle's CRM modules being used.

{"title": "On Tesla's valuation (Part Trois)", "selftext": "Six and twelve months ago I made posts breaking down Tesla's hotly debated valuation ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qj07jj/on_teslas_valuation/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/u8ka1h/on_teslas_valuation_part_deux/)) to determine whether it's really as expensive as people say, or as cheap as Tesla bulls claim.\n\nAfter yesterday's earnings report, my analyses continue to seem fairly accurate, and I thought it would be worth updating the numbers to see if anything's changed.\n\nFor those who don't like reading, you can skip straight to \"The Numbers\". For everyone else, I will first explain again how I got to my numbers.\n\n------------------------------\n\n**The method**\n\nWhile trailing P/E numbers are generally quite meaningless for companies that are growing as fast as Tesla, we can extrapolate their current growth into the future to determine what their trailing P/E would be in the next couple of years should their market cap not rise any further. Although their market cap might change slightly today, let's use their pre-earnings market cap of roughly $700B to determine if Tesla really is over- or undervalued.\n\nFor this post, I have also added the PEG rating, as this can give us a bit more insight into the valuation of a growth stock like Tesla.\n\n------------------------------\n\n**The trends**\n\nIn terms of revenue (TTM), Tesla had grown from $28,176M at the end of Q3 2020 to $46,848M at the end of Q3 2021 in my first analysis. After Q3 2022, that has grown to $74,863, with Q3 2022 being a 55% YoY increase.\n\nIn terms of operating margin, Tesla had grown from 9.2% in Q3 2020 to 14.6% in Q3 2021. After Q3 2022, that has grown to 17.2%.\n\nIn terms of GAAP net income (TTM), Tesla had grown from $556M after Q3 2020 to $3,499M after Q3 2021. After Q3 2022, this has grown to $11,190M, with Q3 2022 being a 103% YoY increased.\n\n------------------------------\n\n**The future**\n\nLast time, I said the following:\n\n> We have now seen that not only did the opening of Giga Texas and Berlin not compress margins, margins even increased by 30% or 4,500 basis points from 14.7% to 19.2% during this quarter. This was highly unexpected and very bullish for Tesla's future expansion in my opinion.\n\nFollowing Q3, this was slightly disappointing at 17.2%. Lower than Q1 despite higher deliveries, in part due to lower deliveries compared to production as Tesla is shifting away from end-of-quarter delivery pushes (20K cars were on a boat at the end of the quarter that previously would've been sold before quarter end). That said, it's still up 18% or 2600 basis points YoY, easily industry leading for high volume automakers (BMW is second at 14.5%), and Tesla guided for record high margins in Q4.\n\nI also said:\n\n> While we have yet to see the impact on margins (only about a thousand cars from Berlin were sold in Q1 and none from Texas), it has been confirmed that Berlin is using the single-piece casted front and rear underbody, as is Texas. Texas is also already using the structural battery pack.\n\nSince then, we have heard rumours that Berlin is expected to reach at least comparable margins to Shanghai, despite significantly higher wages. While this still remains uncertain, it would certainly reinforce their bullish sentiment on margins quoted above.\n\nThen I said:\n\n> I think this number for Texas and Berlin in 2022 proved a little optimistic, given the currently supply chain shortages. Texas and Berlin are currently rumoured to have a run rate of 13,000 per quarter each and are expected to start meaningfully contributing to production in Q3. As such, I would lower my estimate to ~400,000 from Texas and Berlin this year.\n\n> That said, Tesla expects the full ramp-up of Texas and Berlin to happen faster than it did for Shanghai. As such, I'd expect around 1,4M in 2023 and 2M+ in 2024 from Texas and Berlin. Additionally, Shanghai has continued to ramp up and is now approaching a run rate of 900,000 by itself, while Fremont is still around a 500,000 run rate.\n\nSince then, it appears that Texas and Berlin are not ramping faster than Shanghai did. 400K this year is looking entirely impossible, with ~100K being more likely.\n\nThat said, Shanghai has continued to ramp beyond expectation and is now at a 1.2M unit run rate. Peak production so far has been 57K Model Ys in August and 30K Model 3s in September, which would put the factory's maximum real output (remember factories can never reach their full run rate due to holidays and other downtime) at over 1M vehicles per year (highest volume car factory in the world by about 20%) or 250K per quarter. Well above even Q1's 170K.\n\n------------------------------\n\n**The numbers**\n\nUpdating the expected numbers from my previous posts (you can go back to them to compare what has changed if you like) based on the latest information, my Bear and Bull case numbers are as follows:\n\n**Sales**\n\n||Bear Case|Bull Case|\n:--|:--|:--|:--|\n|**2022**|1,350,000|1,500,000|\n|**2023**|2,000,000|2,600,000|\n|**2024**|2,600,000|3,700,000|\n\n**ASP**\n\nLast time, ASPs increased significantly, from $50,000 to ~$57,500. In Q3 2022, they decreased slightly to $54,350. I expect these prices to start to increase again with the upcoming tax incentives, as Tesla mentioned they expect to take the full tax incentive from the Inflation Induction Act for vehicles, battery production and battery sourcing for a total of $10K+ per car. I expect this will offset the reduced demand from the recession and further increase ASPs to ~$57,5K in 2023 and then remain stable while Tesla continues to drive down costs.\n\n\n**Revenue**\n\nBased on the ASPs ($54K for 2022, $57,5K for 2023 and 2024) and delivery numbers, the revenues would be:\n\n||Bear Case|Bull Case|\n:--|:--|:--|\n|**2022**|$73B|$81B|\n|**2023**|$115B|$150B|\n|**2024**|$150B|$213B|\n\n**Operating Margin**\n\nA year ago I said:\n\n> Because of the mix of positive and negative effects on margins while ramping up the two factories, I will keep margins the same in 2022 and restart the increasing trend from 2023.\n\nThis is where I was most wrong after Q1. Tesla showed an operating margin of a staggering 19.2%. This already surpassed my best case scenario for 2023. Since then, operating margin has decreased to 17.2%, with an expected record operating margin in Q4. This makes me slightly less confident about their steep increase in margins, so I will be adjusting those slightly to the downside.\n\n||Bear Case|Bull Case|\n:--|:--|:--|\n|**2022**|17%|19%|\n|**2023**|19%|23%|\n|**2024**|21%|27%|\n\n**Net Income**\n\nMultiplying the total revenue by the operating margin gives us the following Net Income:\n\n||Bear Case|Bull Case|\n:--|:--|:--|\n|**2022**|$12.4B|$15.4B|\n|**2023**|$21.9B|$34.5B|\n|**2024**|$31.5B|$57.5B|\n\n**P/E**\n\nDividing our $700B market cap by the projected net income gives us the following trailing P/E values should the stock stay flat around this market cap:\n\n||Bear Case|Bull Case|\n:--|:--|:--|\n|**2022**|56|45|\n|**2023**|32|20|\n|**2024**|22|12|\n\n**PEG**\n\nSince PE ratios are pretty useless by themselves, I've added a PEG rating this time. Large caps traditionally tend to float at PEG ratios between 1.5 and 3.5. That said, extreme growth companies like Tesla tend to have slightly lower PEG ratios, as investors assume the growth will come down more rapidly over time. So perhaps a PEG between 1 and 2 is more reasonable.\n\nAlso worth to note is that only 1.6% of companies in the S&P have a PEG of below 0.5, and 0.2 is the lowest PEG rating in the entire S&P. As a general rule of thumb though, anything below a PEG of 1 is typically considered undervalued.\n\n||Bear Case|Bull Case|\n:--|:--|:--|\n|**2022**|0.45|0.25|\n|**2023**|0.42|0.16|\n|**2024**|0.50|0.18|\n\n------------------------------\n\n**The conclusion**\n\nAfter Q3 2022 and using the $700B market cap, I expect Tesla to be trading at a trailing P/E of between 12 and 22 by the end of 2024. With a growth rate between 44% and 67% respectively, Tesla would have a PEG rating of between 0.50 and 0.18. To get to normal PEG levels, that means Tesla stock would have to grow between 100% and 1,011% from here through Q1 2025.\n\nInteresting to note is how Tesla only needs to double earnings to have a lower PE ratio than the S&P average, when high growth companies tend to have much higher PEs than the average; I'm expecting Tesla to almost 3x their earnings in just 3 years in the bear case.\n\nAlso worth mentioning is how, even in the bear case scenario, Tesla will become the most profitable automaker in the world by 2023 ($22B in net income compared to Toyota's $21B). In the bull case, they will do more in net income by 2024 than all other automakers combined and more than Apple did until last year.\n\nSo to conclude, the popular sentiment that \"Tesla has decades of growth priced in\" is entirely false.\n\n**Important side note**\n\nFor simplicity sake I have only looked at Tesla's automotive business (including their automotive software sales), as it makes up the vast majority of their revenue and almost all of their Net Income as of this writing. Obviously all of Tesla's future business models, most notably energy and software (FSD and Autobidder) as well as AI (Tesla Bot), deserve to be taken into account when assigning a valuation to the company. But to avoid \"FSD doesn't exist\", \"energy is a scam\" and \"the Bot will never be useful\" kind of comments, I have left these out of the analysis entirely.\n\n**TL;DR:** When you actually look at the data, instead of just reasoning by analogy, Tesla stock will need to grow between 100% and 1,011% through Q1 2025 to revert to the average PEG rating for fast growing large caps.", "id": "y8sdc4", "created_utc": 1666254030.0, "score": 162, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 184, "comments": [{"body": ">After Q3 2022 and using the $700B market cap I expect Tesla to be trading at a trailing P/E of between 12 and 22 by the end of 2024.\n\nAlways use diluted share count when calculating EPS or ratios from market cap.\n\nYou've put so much effort into projecting the behavior of Tesla's business, but it's relation to their equity in your model is off by over 10% because you're using a basic share count to make your future ratios.", "score": 40, "replies": [{"body": "Who knows.

I am not sure of prices elsewhere, but the cheaper EVs here in Canada like the IONIQ 5 are around $15K cheaper than a Tesla (mid 40K range compared to Tesla low 60K range).

I think it is still so.  At that time TSLA market cap was about $1.1 Trillion.  And as of right now it is about $644 billion.  Of course some of this is to the macro environment: inflation, higher interest rates, etc.  But some has to do with market not knowing the next 1 to 3 years of Tesla revenue/earnings.   I still think the appetite for expensive cars is fairly finite.  However, what I didn’t anticipate was the IRA: I think this will help Tesla quite a bit.  If Tesla vehicles qualify: it will reduce the cost quite a bit and so demand in the USA will probably not be an issue.  I will address some points as I did 1 year ago:\n\n1) USA: as above: Tesla won’t have issues here: it is just a matter of how much production they can do in Fremont and Austin.  ~~The expensive model y and 3 will be less expensive if they indeed qualify for the whole $7500 credit (because there is some battery component issue??~~  (I am not a tax advisor so please ask tax advisor if Tesla qualifies for $7500 credit or not).  ~~So this is a change of my view.~~  I do still believe people will still buy the Rav-4, CR-V, etc…Also, there is a little more competition with the Mach E and soon made in Tennessee ID4…however, this does kinda’ gets cancelled out by the Ioniq5/EV6 that won’t qualify for the tax credit so the sales of those will decline.  Bolt, Lightning, Rivian, Lucid: they are not going to produce in enough numbers to take away sales from Tesla.  \n\n2)  China: Ok, this is where the issue lies.  The competition is more fierce this year than last year.  Moreso than I had originally thought.  I know many people think that some of these Chinese companies sell a bunch of these EV and not make money: that is true in some; but the giant bear in china is BYD: they will report an $800-$900 million profit in Q3 2022.  Why is this important?  They are able to sell relatively cheaper cars and still be profitable.  The cars that are going to give Tesla some headaches are: BYD Seal and the upcoming BYD sea lion.  The seal has good range, 0-100 km/hr time, and have a lower price than model 3.  Unlike in the USA: people in China have more choices and will cross shop. In the USA:  we can’t cross shop with model 3; and even with model y: the main competitors are: mach E, ID4, but they aren’t all produced in high numbers yet (EV6/ioniq 5 won’t qualify for tax credit right now so I don’t think it is going to compete much).  However in China: there is a lot of production from not just BYD, but also Xpeng, Nio, and many more others.  \n\n3)  Europe: This is a mix bag. Berlin just started.  There is more competition here than before: moreso than USA, but less than China.  Cars such as Renault Megane didn’t exist 1 year ago.  VW, Stellantis, RMN, BMW are still steady with their EV sales.   For Tesla: UK and Germany is still selling Tesla quite well.  But for whatever reason France and Norway: there is some decline in sales Y-O-Y.  Berlin ramping up will answer the question to the demand in France and Norway.  Netherlands: still hasn’t recovered much.  So the biggest market right now for Europe is UK and Germany.   Electric car incentive will decrease in Germany in 2023: I don’t know how much effect it will have?? \n\n4) Cybertruck: still not out yet.  But this will be a North American vehicle. Too big for Europe\n\n5) So if china demand slows down: tesla can certainly export to other markets: but the other markets such as Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore (the richest countries in Asia-Australia):  I don’t think the market for Tesla will be as high as Europe.  \n\n6) Market Cap of $644 billion today (was $1.1 trillion 1 year ago):  TSLA will have to gain 70% to get back to 1.1 trillion.  What is the difference then and now?  Then: a lot of low interest money: remember all those SPACS??  ARKK?  A lot of market exuberance and many companies didn’t trade on fundamentals.   So at today’s market cap: if tesla just grows 10% per year in market cap, TSLA be $1.3 trillion in 7 years. And in 7 years the PE will probably be 25.  That is net income of $52 billion per year.  For a car company: this is difficult.   I think all profits combined in all automotive sector ex-tesla is < $50 billion today (this is just a guess: Toyota + VW is about $30 billion)??  Last year I wrote: “at $1.1 trillion market cap today: at 10% growth in market cap per year: in 7 years it will be $2.2 trillion market cap. To put things in perspective: AAPL is around $2.48 trillion and they just made about $20 billion this past quarter.  Will Tesla make $19 billion/quarter in 7 years???”---This year,  the question is will TSLA make $13 billion/quarter in 7 years????\n\n7)  Again, I will reiterate that capitalism has a way for a product to find the lowest price with a given quality.  Competition creeps up slowly.  Feds have been tightening money supply with higher interest rates.  Higher interest rates and probable upcoming recession may have some effect on Tesla overall sales.  Time will tell.   \n\n8)  I think 2023 will be the year that we will have a lot more answers to many questions: what is the intrinsic demand in Europe/is the demand really softened in France and Norway? Is the demand slowed down in China?  Also, will Tesla cut prices in China (this will affect margins)?  To get to 2.6 million cars (bear case) produced in 2024, I think Tesla has to build another factory?   As of right now, there hasn’t been an announcement. It takes a while to build a factory. \n\n9) My opinion: USA: demand won’t be an issue.  China: demand will soften. Europe: demand will soften but less so than China.  I am excited to see what 2023 brings to Tesla.\n\nEdit: I am really unsure if tesla model y and 3 will qualify for tax credit or not (so I struck that out above).

Especially with their current economic collapse. I don't see any real competition in US/Europe though, since EV demand here is starting to outstrip supply so much it's unreal. Most Western European countries are on course to hit 90% EV sales in 3-5 years. The only companies that can realistically produce that many EVs by then are Tesla and the Chinese companies. They'll own ~50% of the market if not more (6M+ sales per year).\n\nThe only point I really disagreed with is point 6. Seems to me like you're making some strange assumptions and reasoning by analogy, instead of simply looking at the net income Tesla will be able to generate and assign a PE to that to get to the market cap. Also, the comparison to car companies is always a silly one, since Tesla is a completely different company. They have way higher margins, make 60 part changes per day to each of their models where others struggle to do that much in a year, their entire factories run on AI powered self-management tools, they already earn ~5% of their automotive revenue from software sales and it's only increasing, and I could keep going on and on.\n\n> To get to 2.6 million cars (bear case) produced in 2024, I think Tesla has to build another factory?

And there'll probably be a bunch of cars in transit on 12/31, but that'll be mostly offset by all the cars that are getting delivered right now\n* There's a good chance that a lot of cars that were in transit were higher trim/profit models. Just because it would makes sense for Tesla to prioritize shipping more expensive models that can absorb the shipping price hit, and deliver more of the cheaper models locally\n* Zach made a great point at the beginning of the call, that even taking out credits, Fremont and Shanghai are at almost 30% gross margins. That's probably weighted towards Shanghai and is based on the margins of the cars they actually delivered\n* Austin and Berlin are going to be making way more cars this quarter, so their fixed cost absorption is going to be better and their gross margins will be up\n* Overall volumes are likely to be wayyy up, and Tesla has been doing an excellent job at keeping operating costs low, so operating margins should be up too\n\nLast quarter is what it looks like when you're positioning your company for huge growth. It seems like wall street would've preferred that Tesla sacrifice Q4 margins to make Q3 look marginally better? But Tesla is doing the right thing and keeping margins high and planning for the huge jump in deliveries that are happening right now. There's a lot of reasons to expect Q4 to exceed almost all analyst's predictions and investors are just ignoring it and selling at a huge discount. They're just fucking themselves because they can't look forward 3 months, not even a year or 5 years or any real investment horizon, they can't look forwards beyond a what happened a couple weeks ago.\n\nThe only real downside for this quarter is that the US tax credits go in to effect next year, so people might be delaying their purchase? But Tesla's backlog is so long that I suspect they'll be able to find lots of buyers who have been waiting 6+ months already and don't want to wait another 3-6 months. Also, even if Tesla does delay some deliveries from the end of December to the beginning of January in the US, that'll just be a huge advantage for their customers. I do expect to see them have a decent number of cars in transit at the end of the quarter, just not so many that it'll cause an operational problem of storing/delivering them all in January. But again, that'll be partly offset by all the deliveries of cars made in Q3, that are just happening now.\n\nBut then the credits will be in effect and Tesla is going to be printing money faster than they can count it. They're already an insane cash generating machine, when the tax credits hit their margins are going to go through the roof and the demand for any car they can make will be nuts.\n\nIt's like Tesla won the lottery, but they can't cash their ticket until January, and wall street is losing their shit because they want the money *now*.", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "> It seems like wall street would've preferred that Tesla sacrifice Q4 margins to make Q3 look marginally better?\n\nAlmost correct.

{"title": "The Housing Market Will Crash in 37 Days", "selftext": "If you are one of the millions of people worried about housing prices, let me help you sleep at night: *you're wrong.* \n\nThis post title is easy to click on, everyone has 2008 burned into their brain, it is trendy to talk about how unaffordable real estate is. It gets discussed in the media, people make youtube videos about housing and regards write reddit posts - because it gets engagement/clicks/eyeballs.\n\nThat makes it potentially \"fake news.\" It doesn't need to be true to be discussed.\n\n# Here are some reasons why housing will maintain its uptrend for the next decade:\n\n**1) Mortgage Rates Will Fall Back Down**\n\n* The FED and easy money caused the last bull run after 2008. \n* The FED tightened in 2018 and the market crashed\n* The FED eased during covid, the market moved up \n* The FED tighten in 2022, the market crashed \n* When the FED is done, they will reverse, and they will send the markets back up. They will do this by cutting rates and encouraging people to buy assets \n* Don't fight the FED \n\n**2) Inventory Will Remain Depressed For Longer**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9mlii4ou81v91.png?width=653&format=png&auto=webp&s=37a5fcea936873bf548d9c705432e98e63fc4d58\n\n* No one wants to produce new housing after 2008. \n* We have been under-building and not meeting demand for 10 years \n* People still having kids, people living longer, more houses are needed \n* Price is where supply and demand cross, there is undersupply \n\n**3) Potential Homebuyers Are Much Richer Post-Pandemic, Boomers Are Dying**\n\n* If you don't have more money now than you did pre-covid, you did something wrong \n* Boomers are the richest generation in history, and they are dying and giving their money to their children, who buy houses for their children to live in \n\n**4) Domestic And Foreign Institutional Demand Is Strong**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/znzpicw991v91.png?width=654&format=png&auto=webp&s=ead76805183bb52e31edaa005c6d7276e2b16fb1\n\n**5) The Federal Reserve And Federal Government Are Pro-Homeownership**\n\n* Remember house Biden cancelled student loan debt, and how Pelosi ran the printer, or how Trump cut taxes? \n* The government is pro home ownership. \n* Don't fight the fed \n\n**6) Household Debt is Low, Income Is High**  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8ows36wd51v91.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a653bbe3d6fa1b776cc01ccb6f313caad10f42d\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0cmll2qf51v91.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=27b9682faa73c5d71effded41b8499bd5074b3a8\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**7) Houses Aren't Really That Expensive**\n\n* Relative to everything else, housing doesn't look that bad\n* People need housing (and food, and healthcare) - its not going to just \"crash\" because people don't want it any more \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yw32mz6k51v91.png?width=884&format=png&auto=webp&s=86ac29502721cf19db77b8922e0e80ed04fdfcd2\n\n* Is this trend line really that unreasonable?\n* Does it look like it is ready for a crash?  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xv5svqu041v91.png?width=728&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f3fbb08954588463b8202c2ce67e0c1b16b1214\n\n**8) Borrowers are Much Better** \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x6z1l62o51v91.png?width=1044&format=png&auto=webp&s=a69befd98a267e9e2ab026c606d9eedc3e3fe630\n\n**10) Potential Long-Term Capital Gains Tax Hike/Transacting Real Estate is Expensive** \n\n* If tax rates are higher in the future, then people are going to hold their assets longer, and trade them less \n* Almost everything has come down in price over the past 20-30 years, but real estate agents/brokers still charge 6%\n* The title companies, lawyers, closing agents still charge the same. County filings still cost the same. It is expensive to transact\n\n**11) Higher Conforming Loan Limits Improve Affordability**\n\n* The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) increased the [conforming loan limit for 2022](https://www.financialsamurai.com/conforming-loan-limits/) by 18% to $647,200, up $98,950 from 2021’s limit of $548,250.\n\n**12) Airbnb and Your \"Local Market\" is Meaningless** \n\n* There seem to be so many posts complaining about Airbnb prices, or that no one is getting/making bookings \n   * Airbnb has 7 million listings **in the world**, that represent the \"extra\" housing the market has, that private owners put up for rent. \n   * The average airbnb host makes 10k/yr \n   * \"Airbnb hosts\" are not a significant player in the housing market, they don't/won't effect the price of homes being sold\n   * yurts, igloos, cabins, shipping containers, tiny homes don't count as part of the \"housing market\" \n   * Before you start spouting off about your airbnb details, I am a superhost and have been doing it for 4 years so I have context to this argument \n* It makes no difference what is going on in \"your city\" where you RE prices falling, for something to \"crash\" it has to effect all asset holders. \n\n# Conclusions:\n\n* Supply and demand matter. Decreased supply is going to outweigh the effect of decreased demand. \n* The FED will pivot, the gov is pro home ownership. Don't fight the FED.\n* There is no massive \"debt bomb\" in housing, like there was in 08. No bomb, no \"crash\" \n* Your anecdote is not helpful in evaluating this topic. Neither is mine. Look at the aggregated math, forget your preconceptions \n\nDisagree?

Mortgage debt is increasing as job losses mount.\n\nPoint 7: Data out of date. Housing has inflated further, continued to do so to this day on the rental front though home prices have fallen. Irrespective, a smaller % change on the average Americans largest expenditure (housing) doesn’t mean it’s not a massive change as a % of total budget.\n\nFor example, eggs increasing 20% blows but going from $5 to $6… nobody really gives a fuck.

The 30-year Treasury rate rose to 4.213% Thursday, its highest since 2011, according to Dow Jones Market Data.\n\nFreddie Mac on Thursday said the 30-year mortgage rate was averaging 6.94% in its latest weekly survey, a 20-year high that has severely curtailed demand for new home loans.\n\nBut with U.S. inflation showing no signs of a clear pullback from a 40-year high, expectations have been running high for the Fed to increase its policy rate by another 75 basis points at its November meeting, and potentially by the same amount again in December, according to the CME FedWatch tool.\n\nThe CME odds on Thursday favored a 4.75%-5% fed-funds rate to kick off February.\n\n\"There is a lag effect in mortgages,\" Whalen said, adding that even if central bankers decided to hit pause on additional rate increases after their December meeting, the 30-year mortgage rate still would \"easily touch 10% by February.\"\n\nWhalen, an investment banker, author and specialist focused on banking and mortgage finance, urged the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in 2008 to move complex and opaque derivatives \"back into the daylight,\" after banks and investors saw hundreds of billions of dollars in losses tied to structured debt, including subprime mortgage exposure. He also provided testimony to Congress in 2009 about systemic risks of the banking industry.\n\nNow, Whalen sees another major shakeout coming in mortgage banking as profitability continues to get pinched (see chart) and the housing market sputters.\n\nImportantly, Whalen also sees potential for home prices to give back all of their pandemic gains if rates stay high for all of 2023.\n\nThat's a bigger call than estimates for a 10%-15% correction in home prices from prices that surged 45% nationally during the pandemic.\n\nBut Whalen pointed to speculative home flipping volumes that reached almost $150 billion, or 10% of total home sales in 2022, and the cold blanket of double-digit mortgage rates as catalysts for a steeper home price retreat.\n\nEconomists at Mizuho Securities on Thursday pegged median home sales prices as down 2.5% from their peak, in a client note, and characterized the housing market as \"deteriorating,\" but mostly in line with expectations given the sharp jump in mortgage rates.\n\nMortgage loan rates can be traced directly to the mortgage-backed securities, or MBS, market, which are bonds that trade on Wall Street, mostly with government backing, that finance the bulk of the near $13 trillion U.S. mortgage debt market.\n\nWith the Fed's race to raise rates, it has jolted financial markets, sunk stocks and led to a stark decline in mortgage bond issuance this year, while also making it more expensive for corporations, municipalities and households to borrow as part of its inflation fight.\n\n\"It will take us months to get the bond market and lending market in sync so people can make money again,\" Whalen said.\n\nStocks closed lower for a second straight day on Thursday, leaving the S&P 500 index off 23% on the year at 3,665.78, and the 10-year Treasury rate at 4.225%, its highest since June 2018.\n\n-Joy Wiltermuth\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires 10-20-22 1753ET Copyright (c) 2022 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Mortgage rates will fall down but it will take some time.
