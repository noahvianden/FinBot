Spikes in volatility can happen at any time and at any magnitude.\n\nThat said, over a sufficiently long period of time, IV is mean-reverting. Which means that after it spikes up, it should eventually fall back to average. If it spikes down, it should eventually rise back to average.\n\nSo what many of us do is play volatility instead of be a victim to it.

It contained data that supported the idea to keep holding and buying during a bear market. This applies to both DCAing into indices and buying individual stocks when they reach a target buy price. Personally I do the latter.\n\nWhat I want to share with you is an article from Peter Lynch published in 1997. \n\nhttps://www.worth.com/from-the-archives-fear-of-crashing/?amp\n\nThere are two paragraphs I would like to focus on:\n\n‘A review of the S&P 500 going back to 1954 shows how expensive it is to be out of stocks during the short stretches when they make their biggest jumps. If you kept all your money in stocks throughout these 40 years, your annual return on investment was 11.4 percent. If you were out of stocks for the ten most profitable months, your return dropped to 8.3 percent. If you missed the 20 most profitable months, your return was 6.1 percent; the 40 most profitable, and you made only 2.7 percent. Imagine that - if you were out of stocks for 40 key months in 40 years, trying to avoid corrections, your stock portfolio underperformed your savings account.’\n\nAnd:\n\n‘If you invested $2,000 in the S&P 500 on 1st January of every year since 1965, your annual return has been 11 percent. If you were unlucky and managed to invest that $2,000 at the peak of the market in each year, your annual return has been 10.6 percent.\nOr if you were lucky and invested the $2,000 at the low point in the market, you ended up with 11.7 percent. In other words, in the long run it doesn’t matter much whether your timing is good or bad. What matters is that you stay invested in stocks.’\n\nFor those of you who don’t know Peter Lynch his record is immense and I thoroughly recommend reading any of his books. \n\nHave a good Sunday everyone and, once again, this is financial advice.", "id": "xziqmq", "created_utc": 1665312859.0, "score": 395, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 183, "comments": [{"body": "We don't know everyone's situation.

Prices of homes should reflect interest rates so it's kind of a no-win situation if you're trying to play cost of owning vs cost of renting.  \n\nAt least when you own you can do things to improve the value of your home that actually make the place you live more attractive to YOU. You can also leverage the equity you have in your home to do other things.  If you're facing in increasing rate environment as now you do risk your property value going down as rates go up but then you can play the long/short term mortgage choice according to your feeling about where things are going.  I'm tending to think that rates have been very low for a long time and maybe the tide is turning to a higher rate long term situation.  If so, it's a good time to consider buying, especially if home prices start to come down into a range that would be considered historically normal.  \n\nRight now the situation is in flux.  Home prices are still hanging on for now and interest rates are still low.  You want to wait until the home prices start to drop as those who were over-leveraged need to unload their homes at lower prices.  It's not there yet and it may not happen but if it does as happened in the 80s, those with some money put away will be in a good place.\n\nFor a long time nobody has wanted to hold cash or cash equivalent investments.

There was a time when PEs for the whole S&P was 7. It might not be likely, but it is not out of the question that average PEs could get back into the single digits. How much lower do you think oil stock PEs should go? They could pay out a 20% dividend right now, that is insane! The oil valuations are low because people expect the oil prices to go down, but they are wrong, it is going way way up once governments are forced to stop intervening to try to keep oil price down.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "I think that PE was back in the early 80’s when the internet didn’t even exist. Times can change, in 20 years the average PE may be 30. There is no law that says what’s a normal PE, only our subjective opinions. \nAnd with oil, its been a good trade this year for sure, I’ll give you that. And with OPEC cutting production to make more profit, that’s good news for oil as well. I guess I’m just not the type to invest in standard commoddoties, even though I may miss out on some good years (like this year). \nI would also reluctantly mention that the world is trying to move away from fossil fuels.

We have not even hit peak coal let alone peak oil. Oil companies have been underinvesting in exploration for the past 5 years because ESG says we are moving away from oil. The demand for oil is still increasing and there will be a decrease in supply of 4 to 6 million barrels a day in the next couple of months which will put massive upward pressure on oil prices.  \n\nUS and China are both releasing 1 million barrels per day from their SPR, that has to stop sooner or latter, November after the election for the US. When China stops the zero covid policy and shutting down their cities, that is an additional 1 to 2 million barrels per day of demand. This winter, Russian supply of oil drops by 1 to 2 million barrels per day because they can't produce oil in Siberia in the winter without western oilfield service companies that all pulled out of Russia.  \n\nSolar and wind energy are not capable of supplying the world with energy. They are a waste of time and a distraction. They don't produce enough energy to justify mining the minerals required to build them. It is a feel good story being sold to people that are paying zero attention to reality.  \n\nThe only answer that works long term is nuclear energy and in the short run it is oil, coal and nat gas. 18% of world energy is used as electricity and 82% is from direct combustion of hydrocarbons. Of the 18% of world energy that is used as electricity, the majority of the electricity is generated using hydrocarbons. That can't be replaced quickly especially because you need diesel to mine the resources necessary to build EVs, solar panels and wind turbines. The ESG driven underinvestment in fossil fuels will result in oil going to $200 to $300 in the next 1 to 3 years.
