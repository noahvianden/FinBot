{"title": "Strategist David Rosenberg skewers the Federal Reserve as he sees a 30% hit to home prices and the S&P 500 returning to an early 2020 low", "selftext": "The last time David Rosenberg shared his outlook for the U.S. stock market and the economy with MarketWatch, in late May, it was depressing enough.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n“I feel like I am reliving the summer of 2008,” Rosenberg wrote then. He speculated that the S&P 500 SPX, +1.19% — then trading above 3,900 points — would ultimately flirt with 3,300.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRosenberg is the widely followed president and chief economist and strategist of Toronto-based Rosenberg Research & Associates Inc. His sobering outlook last May echoed his thinking from March 2022, when he called the Federal Reserve’s intention to hike U.S. interest rates “not a good idea” and predicted that the inflation-fighting move would trigger a painful economic recession.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFive rate hikes later, with more expected, Rosenberg is even more pessimistic about the stock market and the economy in 2023 — and to say he’s disappointed with the Federal Reserve and Chairman Jerome Powell would put it mildly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n“The Fed’s job is to take the punch bowl away as the party gets started, but this version of the Fed took the punch bowl away at 4 a.m.,” Rosenberg said, “when everybody was pissed drunk.”\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMany market experts and economists are now coming to Rosenberg’s side of the fence — criticizing the Fed for waiting too long to battle inflation and warning that the central bank now may be moving too fast and too far.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut Rosenberg is leaning even further over the railing. Here’s what he says investors, homeowners and workers can expect in the year ahead: The S&P 500 tumbles to as low as 2,700 (the lowest since April 2020), U.S. home prices decline by 30%, and the unemployment rate rises. The U.S. economy sinks into a recession, for which the Fed — especially Powell — would be largely to blame.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n“He went from Bambi to Godzilla,” Rosenberg says of Powell’s radical and rapid transformation from inflation skeptic to inflation slayer. Adds Rosenberg: “Powell was getting compared to \\[disgraced 1970s Fed Chair\\] Arthur Burns. Nobody in central banking wants to be compared to Arthur Burns. This is the reality.”\n\n&#x200B;\n\nReality admittedly isn’t something the financial markets have had much of a grip on in the past several years, with essentially free money and a hands-off Fed fueling a go-go investing climate. “Now that movie is running in reverse,” Rosenberg says, and the reality here is that the next scenes will be tough ones.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut since markets are cyclical, the Fed’s flushing inflation and dumping the punch bowl should lead to a new bull market for stocks, bonds and other risk assets, Rosenberg says. He sees this fresh start beginning in 2024, so don’t despair — that’s less than 15 months away.\n\nIn this mid-October interview, which has been edited for length and clarity, Rosenberg discussed the challenging conditions investors face now and offered his top ideas for their money over the next 12 months — including Treasury bonds, stock sectors that can profit from longer-term business trends and technology themes, and good old-fashioned cash.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMarketWatch: You’ve been skeptical of the Fed’s interest-rate hikes since they began last March. But it seems that your skepticism has morphed into a kind of disbelief. What is the Fed doing now that is so unprecedented?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRosenberg: The Fed is ignoring market signals and chasing lagging indicators like the year-over-year in the CPI and the unemployment rate. I’ve never seen the Fed at any point before this version totally dismiss what’s happening on the supply side of the economy and totally ignore what’s happening from market signals. I’ve never seen the Fed tighten this aggressively into a raging bull market for the U.S. dollar DXY, -0.18%. I’ve never seen the Fed tighten this aggressively into a major decline, not just in the stock market but in the most economically sensitive stocks.

Does this mean that people are running out of money to spend? Hence, we could see inflation slow down now because people can't afford excessive purchases anymore. People have exhausted their covid money and then some.\n\nThe $4.8 trillion during covid was caused by people's fears of the economy collapsing so they saved, stimulus checks, and the lack of things to spend their money on due to stay-at-home orders.\n\nAlso, it's quite shocking to see how Americans are able to spend their money so fast. It's as if people thought the boom was going to last forever and that they weren't ever going to run out of money. The average American can't seem to see beyond the next 3 months. Personally, my savings have actually increased because I didn't believe this boom would last forever.\n\nThere is a theory on inflation that suggests inflation is partly psychological and not based in reality. People and businesses just expect inflation after a while so workers continuously ask for higher wages which in turn causes businesses to charge higher prices. Here, we can see that people actually have less money now to spend than in 2009. To break this cycle, the fed needs to provide an interest rate shock like what Volcker did. \\[0\\]\\[1\\]\\[2\\]\\[3\\]\n\n**The main question is: is there a correlation between personal savings and inflation? Another question is if personal savings is now so low, why are people still spending so much?

I, and some others, have been pointing out that no personal life changes were necessary as the recession we're currently in has done a good job of fucking us over without changing anything personally. It means that although this person had savings and was paying off their credit before, this is now all gone due to rising costs of everything. Then you continue telling us that those were not personal circumstances.\n\nSo I'm am just \"nitpicking\" in order to understand what the fuck you are talking about? That this person didn't save enough when they had the chance? That they should've reduced their spending when prices went up? \n\nBelieve it or not, some people already lived at the limit before it all went down. That doesn't mean they don't do a good job, it only means that wages haven't grown at the same rates as cost of living has increased or student loans have. Even before the recession and the pandemic and Trump as president, many people could only afford to live from paycheck to paycheck with very little wiggle room for building a nest egg. \n\nI think what you were trying to say very clunky is that, since we are all affected by the recession and not yet defaulting on our loans this one person did something wrong. But this would require us all to start at the same base level (amount of student loans, living in the same cost of living area etc), which we clearly don't. In fact, it is a privilege these days to be able to still afford to spend without worrying about defaulting on loans and mortgages. It's a privilege to be able to still save and not wonder at the gas pump whether this will bring your account in the negatives. When I save a hundred euros less a month due to rising costs of living, I'm still privileged, when for another person this hundred euros was *all* they managed to save and now they can't save anything.

The trade war vs China is probably the biggest immediate inflation driver with proximal causes ranging from tariffs (that create about 1.3% of the inflation we are experiencing) to shortages in chips and other goods that drive up prices. ESG investing activism and a government bent on energy-production suppression has created an era of chronic under-investment in energy production infrastructure leading to supply constraints that have driven up the price of energy (the energy crunch started in 2021 well before Russia invaded Ukraine). You can't cut energy production without an energy shock if you do nothing to cut energy consumption. We are experiencing the energy inflation today because our government and activist investing groups are attempting to defy logic and cut energy production while energy consumption in increasing. Throwing money at wars and military conflicts in a time of supply chain problems and shortages, is also a big inflation driver.

{"title": "Apple tightens its rules on crypto and NFTs. Any trading service of NFTs must use Apple’s in-app payment mechanism where Apple gets 30% cut", "selftext": "https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/25/apple-tightens-its-rules-on-crypto-and-nfts-in-its-app-store.html\n\nApple clarified its rules on cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) laying out what apps are allowed to do with these technologies. On crypto exchanges, Apple said in updated App Store rules on Monday, that apps may facilitate “transactions or transmissions of cryptocurrency on an approved exchange.” But the app can only be offered in countries or regions where it has licensing and permission to operate a crypto exchange. “Apps may not use their own mechanisms to unlock content or functionality,” such as cryptocurrencies or cryptocurrency wallets. Apple has clarified the rules on NFTs, which can be a digital representation of a real-life asset such as artwork and are usually purchased using cryptocurrency. The guidelines say apps may use in-app purchases to sell NFTs and sell services related to them, such as minting, listing, and the transferring of these tokens. Apps can also allow users to browse NFT collections owned by others so long as the apps do “not include buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than in-app purchase.”\n\nAll of this means that any sort of trading service for NFTs must use Apple’s in-app payment mechanism. Apple takes an up to 30% cut of in-app payments. While this does not ban NFTs in any way, it does put a major restriction on the kind of services that can be offered involving NFTs, given the 30% slice Apple takes. Apple’s 30% cut has long been criticized by app makers who accuse the technology giant of running a monopoly over in-app purchases. Apple argues that control over the App Store allows it to ensure the security of apps and payments. It has also said that the App Store has birthed a successful app ecosystem allowing developers to make money.", "id": "yd4rdd", "created_utc": 1666704267.0, "score": 290, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 157, "comments": [{"body": "I’m looking for serious clarification on this.
