But he will have the last laugh while y'all sleep. \n\nTwo things happened simultaneously that made this clear within 10 minutes using the Occulus:\n\n- My brain completely believed and accepted the VR world. It believed the depth, the scale, the \"look left, track left\" thing, the woozy feeling looking over a cliff and the straight up magnificence of being on the deck of some freakin spaceship looking out the grand window over some moon.  Yep, mediocre graphics and all.  Like an optical illusion, my brain was hopelessly tricked into believing what I was seeing. \n\n- At the very same time, my brain also completely knew it wasn't real and it was totally cool with that.  I knew I wasn't actually painting a virtual canvas or picking up a ping pong ball and hitting it with a paddle.

I don't need any convincing.

A new line is in the works and before any actual samples get made, the design team can AR the ideas on themselves or a model, whatever.  They can move, turn, open the jacket, all that shit that models do and the team can see how it's going to flow, what the colors look like, how the fabric falls.  It blows away seeing sketches or even 3D wire frames on a high rez screen.  \n\nWhy? Because your brain believes it wayyy easier than you'd think.  Our brains are masters at filling in information that it needs to interpret the world in front of it.  Simply seeing an AR projection of a rudimentary graphic on things we already have cues for (human size, depth perception, lines of perspective, etc) and our brains fill in the rest and make it comfortable and real. Think about how much time and money could be saved not having to produce 20 samples of a jacket before you send it to the manufacturer.  AR VR will allow us to know instantly that a jacket is 1/2\" too short or the collar doesn't sit just right yet.  \n\nAnyone skeptical can think about this:  When you go stand near railroad tracks and look towards the horizon, what do you see? You see two lines converging into a point in the distance. A giant stretched out triangle.   Everything your eyes see tell you that those two tracks are not fkin parallel.  If that was all you had to go by and you saw a train coming you'd be going crazy trying to get the conductor to stop from a catastrophic accident.  But ofc our brains know from experience that the rails are perfectly parallel and we're completely fine ignoring the sensory input of our most trusted sensor! Our brains reconcile that paradox for us seamlessly.  And the parallel nature is as real as the 3 feet front of us. \n\nWhen you apply this ridiculously complex mental gymnastics we do every day without any effort to something like AR VR it's incredible.  Hint: The goal isn't to TRICK people that they're in a real forest.  The goal is to ALLOW the brain to do its thing and reconcile that paradox in the background while we excitedly and safely enjoy walking up to a grizzly bear we know isn't real but also is. \n\nOh and btw- Zuck did a terrible job explaining why his teaser graphic was like a meme of Second Life 2002.  Do y'all realize the processing power it takes to render and redraw an immersive universe in real-time that must sync properly with a billion other people in that universe at the same time and not have any paradoxes?? It's quantum level.  We don't even have the tech to do more than what Zuck demonstrated.

If google failed at so many futuristic products and made basically no strides in that direction, why would Meta succeed at them ?\n\nI don't believe in Meta what so ever, they are burning money for little strides, also good, but i wouldn't bet on their stock.\n\nComments about replacing mouse and keyboard also perplexed me, they been around for 50 years, nowhere close to being replaced. Nowhere close being redundant, and whatever people dream about isn't going to replace mouse and keyboard.\n\nEven touchscreen that has been around for 30 years is nowhere close to replacing computer mouse, no matter how much people shilled that the days of mouse and keyboard are over. I don't think it ever will, capabilities of tapping the screen is severely limited, mouse and keyboard achieves a way more, so many consumers and offices are still on them.\n\nEither playing complex games or engineering software or any other more complicated use touchscreen is nowhere near replacing them. Every hollywood idol gets in front of the camera, every streamer and youtuber and content creator gets in front of the camera and works with their mouse, keyboard computers, touchscreen has gained market but completely failed to replace things or solve the problems.\n\nWhat market touchscreen did get is ease of access for very simplistic people, fulfills the needs for quick and simple access perfectly, very often the only thing used in poor countries and minimum wage workers or just simpler people.\n\nButtons on a mobile didn't give more functionality, as the mobile is handheld and only gets used by 2 fingers, so holding the phone in one hand and tapping the touchscreen with remaining hand is better, if there was buttons instead they would need to be hard pressed and the force exerted on the holding hand would make for very uncomfy experience.\n\nMouse and keyboard on the other hand gives a ease of access to complex things like more than 100 buttons, all 10 fingers can often be constantly used to achieve things.\n\nI heard shit is getting replaced for as long as i been alive, it hasn't work out that way, not even close. Smartphone success wasn't about replacing anything, it was more about tapping into new market of people.\n\nAll that being said i fail to see how strapping on a VR tech on your head improves anything, solves anything or replaces anything or taps into any new market and destroys keyboard and mouse ?", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": ">The problem is the metaverse solves no actual problem.\n\nYou could say the same thing about the internet in the 90s", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "100%.

It's like no one actually looked at the financial report and just looked at the share price and went, \"yup, Meta Verse\".\n\nIf you actually cared to read the report and listen to the earnings call you would see, \n\nActive users are up 4%\n\nAd impressions up 17%\n\nRevenue only down 4%, not bad considering ad price is down 18% and down to mostly FX, otherwise would have been up if FX was constant.\n\nStill have another $11 billion available for share repurchases along with $41.78 billion in cash...\n\nARPU is also still more or less inline with last two quarters, fully factoring in privacy change headwinds.\n\nThe big one that I see and the one that most likely sent people running, was the abysmal free cash flows. Which was something like $160 million down from a $6 to $8 billion from previous quarters. Now most people's natural reaction is Meta Verse... nope. On the earnings call they said CapEx growth was down to increase in infrastructure to support A.I in their core products and expand data center capacity to bring down future overhead costs. \n\nThe A.I part I found particularly interesting because it shows they are investing heavily in their core products still despite what people think. They believe it will help increase engagement and Ad targeting. From what I gathered and had been pretty successful so far on a small scale so are rolling it out across the whole family of apps. I suspect once the infrastructure is invested in this will lead to even more impressive profit margins. So I say it's a good call if they want to remain competitive over TikTok and improve core products. They also noted it depends on the returns they see that will dictate the level of future spend, but so far they mentioned it led to a 15% increase in watch time gain.\n\nHonestly in the morning I was on the fence. But after looking into everything and listening to the call I'm actually pretty bullish, and will be happy to pick up more at a 20-25% discount tomorrow if people want to sell it to me that low. From what I can see this is all negative sentiment towards the company, around the Meta verse and Mark Zuckerberg himself. But looking at the fundamentals I honestly can't see anything to seriously worry about. They are still heavily investing in their core platform while investing in VR which sounds good to me. It's not a complete abandonment of core products like people make it out to be. Their products are also still going strong with lots of good partnerships been announced as well (Salesforce for example). Active Users and engagement is also still high and not going anywhere, despite the constant narrative everyone is switching to TikTok, the data just shows that isn't true.\n\nSomething else that also made me more bullish on the VR front was not VR itself but mixed reality. I didn't even consider this till I heard it mentioned on the call. I'm not fan of VR, but mixed reality is definitely something that has a lot of potential and widespread adoption if you ask me. I mean think about Pokemon go and how popular that was when it was launched. That's essentially what you looking at with Mixed reality, merging virtual and physical reality. I really like the idea of been able to interact with virtual content in the physical world myself. Google attempted something similar with Google Glass and it flopped, however I think it was to early and to ambitious. If Meta can reduce the bulkiness of the headsets to a more manageable and portable size I think this has a lot of potential. Either way it doesn't really matter, Meta is still solid financially and fundamentally. I personally see this as more these misconceptions investors have about Meta than the actual fundamentals of the company.\n\nTo sum it up I'll be buying more first thing on open, this is 100% a value play in my mind and haven't seen any serious actual counter points that raise serious red flags beyond \"Facebook's dead\", \"TikTok is stealing market share\", \"Revenue/user base is falling\", etc, etc. All of which are false based on what we're seeing.", "score": 123, "replies": [{"body": "Damn the most interesting part about your comment is that they really are trying to fight tiktok with AI investment which makes sense to me.", "score": 34, "replies": [{"body": "I've heard some secondhand discussion of Youtube's analysis of TikTok's algorithm.

But it’s not at all likely that the company will die before it stops trying. \n\n(3) Zuckerber is mad\n\nHe’ll always weigh down the price of the stock, but FB is a company where you’d expect greed to win out in the end. E.g. he’ll give up with metaverse before the stock goes to 0. \n\n(4) The advertising business model is unethical\n\nFair enough. \n\nIt would be good to see of what Meta’s risk consists of. Many seem to expect that in the coming years there’s a high chance that the stock goes to zero if the Metaverse play doesn’t pan out.

Plugging in the numbers for the appropriate fields would resolve that in order to achieve a Month over Month reduction would mean that the individual month of actual price increase by percentage for an annual resolution of PCE at 4.1% would be 4.1/12, which is 0.3416…% Monthly.\n\nNow simply put, this means that the rate of change needed to resolve an annualized rate more than halved in the last month of change, and means not that the last month saw that much more compared to the previous month, but the difference of the annualized value to this negative move.  It is a massive reduction in the rate of change, and means that if we see 2 more months of this kind of negative change, more than halving thrice in a row, then we would see an effective zero percent PCE projection based solely on a month over month rate.\n\nIt probably would have been easier to just explain that the rate is annualized, but now you have the math, the formula to run it yourself in the future, and the source for the data to learn more on the topic if you so desire.", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you good sir for this very detailed info!", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Happy to share!  :)", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "Huh, are we actually getting that soft landing?", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "Probably not.

As more dev friendly competitors plug the hole and people move because they can get better apps on newer systems. It won't be immediate, but I definitely see it happening. If it doesn't then a lot of companies go under water and that's the end of any meaningful app growth. Advertising is the life blood of most of the phone application market.

Or quickly adapt the ads they see in real time based on starting on a wider range of ads, and quickly narrowing it down to the ones that are most likely to have an impression. Which justifies their CapEx on this even more.\n\nI don't think this is as doom and gloom as that post implies. But people seem to want Meta to fail so they find reasons for it to do just that.

Debt can provide something called a tax shield because it can be tax deductible. Buying back shares while utilizing debt right now is actually quite smart. If you can use that to fund the business, while also buying back shares at the current reduced price, and using it to reduce your overall tax burden at the same time it's basically free money.

{"title": "Amazon sinks on weak fourth-quarter guidance", "selftext": "* Earnings: 28 cents per share\n* Revenue: $127.10 billion vs. $127.46 billion, according to Refinitiv estimates\n\nLike the rest of Big Tech, Amazon has had a rocky year so far as it confronts macroeconomic headwinds, soaring inflation and rising interest rates. Those challenges have coincided with a slowdown in Amazon’s core retail business, as consumers returned to shopping in stores.\n\nUnder CEO Andy Jassy, who took the helm from founder Jeff Bezos in July 2021, Amazon has responded to rising expenses by aggressively cutting costs across numerous divisions in recent months. It shed warehouse space, halted some experimental projects, shuttered its telehealth service and froze hiring for corporate roles in its retail business.\n\nStill, analysts are expecting Amazon to report solid third-quarter results, thanks to easier comparisons with last year’s numbers and a potential sales boost from its annual Prime Day discount event, which was held in July.\n\nRevenue growth is projected to come in at 15%, marking a return to double-digit expansion after three straight quarters of growth in the single digits.\n\nAnother bright spot could be Amazon’s advertising unit, which has been more resilient compared to peers including Meta, Alphabet and Snap, whose ads businesses have gotten whacked due to the economic environment and Apple’s iOS privacy changes last year.\n\nOn Tuesday, Alphabet missed expectations for the third quarter, and YouTube’s ad revenue declined for the first time since Google started breaking out results for the streaming video unit. Facebook parent Meta stumbled again on Wednesday, issuing disappointing earnings and a weaker-than-expected forecast for the fourth quarter.\n\n“Besides allocation to TikTok, budget shift to lower funnel activities is the consistent point of feedback in our conversations with marketers this quarter,” said Rob Sanderson, a managing director at Loop Capital who recommends buying Amazon shares, in a recent note to clients. “Amazon is the lowest on the funnel.”\n\nWall Street will also be paying close attention to Amazon’s fourth-quarter guidance. The forecast could signal how much demand Amazon expects to see during the holiday shopping period. Analysts are already girding for a lackluster season, with online sales expected to grow just 2.5%, according to Adobe.\n\nEarlier this month, Amazon hosted a 48-hour Prime Early Access Sale, which was the first time it has held two major discount events in the same year. The event jump-started the holiday shopping period early, and it could help juice Amazon’s sales in the fourth quarter. Analysts surveyed by Refinitiv are projecting fourth-quarter revenue of $155.15 billion.\n\nAnalysts have taken different approaches to their per-share earnings estimates because of Amazon’s hefty investment in electric-vehicle maker Rivian, which went public late last year. The plunge in Rivian’s share price forced Amazon to take a combined $11.5 billion markdown in the first two quarters of 2022. However, Rivian shares rebounded a bit in the third quarter, climbing 28%, which could lead Amazon to mark up the investment.\n\nAmazon shares have slid 34% so far this year, while the S&P 500 index has dropped 20% over the same period.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/27/amazon-amzn-earnings-q3-2022.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/27/amazon-amzn-earnings-q3-2022.html)", "id": "yf207r", "created_utc": 1666901445.0, "score": 151, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 114, "comments": [{"body": "Currently -19% in afterhours trading.

The Company posted a September quarter record revenue of $90.1 billion, up 8 percent year over year, and quarterly earnings per diluted share of $1.29, up 4 percent year over year. Annual revenue was $394.3 billion, up 8 percent year over year, and annual earnings per diluted share were $6.11, up 9 percent year over year.\n\n“This quarter’s results reflect Apple’s commitment to our customers, to the pursuit of innovation, and to leaving the world better than we found it,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “As we head into the holiday season with our most powerful lineup ever, we are leading with our values in every action we take and every decision we make. We are deeply committed to protecting the environment, to securing user privacy, to strengthening accessibility, and to creating products and services that can unlock humanity’s full creative potential.”\n\n“Our record September quarter results continue to demonstrate our ability to execute effectively in spite of a challenging and volatile macroeconomic backdrop,” said Luca Maestri, Apple’s CFO. “We continued to invest in our long-term growth plans, generated over $24 billion in operating cash flow, and returned over $29 billion to our shareholders during the quarter. The strength of our ecosystem, unmatched customer loyalty, and record sales spurred our active installed base of devices to a new all-time high. This quarter capped another record-breaking year for Apple (AAPL.NaE), with revenue growing over $28 billion and operating cash flow up $18 billion versus last year.”\n\nApple’s board of directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.23 per share of the Company’s common stock. The dividend is payable on November 10, 2022 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 7, 2022.\n\nApple (AAPL.NaE) will provide live streaming of its Q4 2022 financial results conference call beginning at 2:00 p.m. PT on October 27, 2022 at apple.com/investor/earnings-call.

As the stock price drops without deterioration in fundamentals, risk drops and potential reward increases. I'd argue META isn't showing any real deterioration in fundamentals (with the expectation of Apple's privacy change) and this drop is largely sentiment driven.\n\nMy theory about META is that the growth investors sold it earlier this year on slower future growth assumptions and this attracted a wave of value investors. The only problem is that value investors tend to whine when a company isn't 100% focused on profitability and now META is disappointing these investors too with their continued commitment to the Metaverse.\n\nThere's really no identifiable investor base for META at this point. If you're looking for growth it's not that attractive anymore. And if you're looking for value you don't want to own a company that's pursuing growth over profitability. The investors who might like it are those that share Zuck's vision on the future of AR/VR and those are basically no existent.\n\nThe way I'd look at META is that while they're not likely to grow like they did in the past, this is still the second largest digital ads player in the world and a company with more reach than any other company to the global consumer. If their DAUs and MAUs were dropping then I'd understand why investors were fleeing, but the core business is still really strong. This valuation decline is not reflective of a comparable decline in the core business but instead entirely driven by the sentiment of investors.\n\nI think there is huge upside risk to anyone bearish on this stock right now. Perhaps as much as 100% upside over the next 6 months. What we're seeing with META today is very similar to the situation with NFLX earlier this year. Growth investors fled at signs of slowing growth and then value investors jumped in and started crying about how much they were spending on content and that they didn't to compromise their product by introducing ads. The only difference here is that NFLX caved to the value investors while META didn't.\n\nIf META simply said they're done with the metaverse (which I don't think they should do) and that they're going to be returning as much profits to shareholders as possible I can almost guarantee that the stock would rally 100%.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Nice prediction lol", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "META is the new Nokia.

Beat on revenue (yes only 1.15% but still a beat when everyone forecasting doomsday for ad revenue). Missed on EPS by $.21 (11.32%) but that’s only about $565M. Maybe he should have cut expenses by $600M (out of $22B) to beat on EPS, but reaction is over blown. People saying they should have higher FCF (free cash flow) but why?  What do you do with FCF? Pay dividends? Not applicable. Pay down debt?  Only has $10B in debt which they just got before rates went up and they have $40B in cash so no net debt. Buyback stock? They bought back $6.5B in the 3rd quarter. Invest in the business?  That’s exactly what the’re doing. \n\nMost spend is on core apps to increase engagement and revenue via AI investments. That shows short term benefits. Reels annual revenue run rate went from $1B in 2Q22 to $3B in 3Q22. Spend is working. Also spending significant amount to consolidate facilities which will result in long term expense reduction. \n\nSo that leaves spend on Reality Labs (or what everyone refers to as metaverse spend).  Clearly an optics/communication issue here since no one knows what metaverse is. But this spend is on four platforms which they have to do a better job of explaining. The $1500 Quest Pro headsets are only part of one of those platforms (VR Platform) and the target audience is not the general consumer. They have the cheaper Quest for the consumer and are delivering an enhanced model of that next year. The cheaper Quest model is already outselling game consoles although that bar is getting lower. The Pro is being designed for a whole new way to get work done with a headset instead of a laptop or pc. Without full details, it still starts to make sense in that context. The other platforms include a new Social Platform (that is their core business after all), an Augmented Reality platform (with glasses rather than goggles!) and a Neural Interfaces platform (which does seem the most futuristic of all). \n\nCould they spend a little less on these platforms?  Probably. But they are spending within their revenue and they said they would moderate to make sure they still delivered shareholder value. They are not increasing headcount for 2023 from 3Q22 and the increased OpEx for 2023 is because of the full year compensation for people who were hired in 2022 (and therefore were not part of FY2022 OpEx). The increase in CapEx is almost entirely from increase in AI spending which is the most critical to maintain and increase engagement and revenue in core apps. They haven’t provided revenue numbers so it’s hard to know what the impact to EPS and PE will be next year. \n\nSo maybe Meta and Zuckerberg are not doing everything right but I don’t think they deserve the pounding they are getting. They can cut a little spending to hit better earnings numbers and probably have little, negative impact to Reality Labs, but, more importantly, they must do a better job of communicating business strategy and vision along with associated financials.

That is called \"being in the money\". You also have the choice to close the option for a profit in the premium price when the underlying stock appreciates in the direction of your option strike. For example:\n\nXYZ stock share price goes from $90 to $80. You own 1 Put option with a strike of $85. You purchased the option for $0.50 (per share x 100), for a total premium price of $50, when the shares were worth $90. Now the premium is worth $1.00 (per share x 100), for a total premium price of $100. Because you are betting the share price would decline, and you were correct, your $85 Put is now ITM (in the money), and worth double what you paid. \n\nNow you have two choices:\n(A) since your Put is ITM, you can \"exercise\" it, and therefore sell 100 shares at a price of $85. If you do not own any shares of the underlying stock, then exercising this Put would put you into a Short Sale position, which means you now owe the market a purchase of 100 shares. But, since the shares are trading at $80 and you sold 100 shares at $85 by exercising, you purchase 100 shares at $80 each, which realizes a profit of $500 ($85 x 100 = $8500; $80 x 100 = $8000; sale of shares @ $8500 - purchase of shares @ $8000 = profit of $500). *One major downside to exercising any option, regardless of it being a Call or a Put, is that you MUST have the cash in your account to purchase the 100 shares at the strike price. In this scenario you need to have $8000 available to buy back the shares, hence why most people do option B.*\n\n(B) since your premium price doubled, it's profitable. If you don't want to deal with the hassle of exercising your option, then you can \"sell to close\" your option and just take the profit from the premium price. *Most people choose this option because they are trading options for the profitability and quick turnover, so they don't want to exercise and hold shares.\n\nNote: this is a hypothetical example, in reality your premium price would be worth much more than $100 when your option is ITM because of the amount of intrinsic value. It would be closer to $500. I just simplified it for readability.\n\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/putoption.asp", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Our AI tracks our most intelligent users.

{"title": "Elon Will Get Cancelled Soon", "selftext": "**Positives**: Let's keep it real, Elon deserves a lot of credit for all of his accomplishments, positivity brought into the world, a vision for a future and trying to turn humanity into a multi-planetary species. \n\n**Character**: With all that being said, he is kind of an annoying human. If he wasn't rich, wasn't good at engineering, wasn't changing the world, no one would like him personally. Mother of his children and x wife is all the character reference you need. \n\n**Interest Rates:** With the interest rate environment drastically different, and the TSLA bros starting to get underwater, his magic touch is wearing off. Just look at the TSLA chart YTD and try to feel positive about that. You can't. \n\n**Comps**: Kanye was the greatest rapper of all time. Trump was the greatest president of all time (not saying I agree, but some do). Elon is the greatest engineer of all time. No one really cares about their accomplishments if they don't comply with the social fabric of the new woke left America. It really doesn't matter about facts, only about feels. Not sure Elon gives people the good vibes he used to. Trump, Kanye, Elon are the three free speech musketeers - two out of these three are officially cancelled already. \n\n**Annoying**: Sink into twitter is a bitch move. It mocks the establishment, mocks the left. He threatens to fire 75% of the staff - even if they deserve it, this is a very \"non left\" thing to do. \n\n**Women**: He keeps impregnating women and then leaving them. Lefties don't like that. He impregnates his employees as well. I am sure there are some settlements out there he has made, or an abortion he paid for, just a matter of time until someone attacks him. \n\n**Anti-Vax Narative:** He is anti vax in some regard. He believes in science for sure, but isn't afraid to criticize WHO, Fauci, Biden, The Government, Big Pharma or other players on the left. \n\n**Capitalism is Bad Now:** He is anti worker, pro capitalist. Expects people to sleep in the factory, return to work, do his bidding or be unemployed. \n\n**Big Tech is Bad Now:** Both left and right hate “big tech” - this is one of the only things that politicians agree on. Social media is bad, consumer privacy should be protected, tech companies shouldn't have more power than politicians. \n\n**Disrespects the Government:** He smokes weed on Joe Rohan with privileged defense contracts. This is just another disrespectful move to bite the hand that feeds him. He shits on Biden, Biden shits on him. Elon drops memes like he is 14 years old mocking the establishment, and he has a very large following - that makes him a target. \n\n**Indian Giver:** He demands the Gov pay for his starlink service for ukraine when the gov, nor ukraine, never asked him to save the day like that. You don't invite your friend to dinner, then complain and ask them to pay for it after the fact. Indian giving is a bitch move. \n\n**Conspiracy Theorist:** He promotes Russel Brands youtube channel. Sure MSM is total bullshit, but that doesn't make RB a source of truth. If you promote stuff like that, you are playing for the wrong team. The team that gets cancelled.  \n\n**\\[Redacted\\]:** His is king of \"that which can't be named here\" the bros are and their coins are not doing so hot right now. Powell actively wants them gone. The social media influencers who promoted these pump and dump coins are facing their time in court, Elon is the main dude pumping.\n\n**Not Green Enough:** The \"green\" left is starting to be alienated by Elon specifically. He is too rich, too successful, to capitalist. Lets not forget the cars themselves are not exactly \"green\" to produce and the whole idea of EVs being \"more green\" than ICE cars is a u argument that doesn't stand up to scrutiny. \n\n**Lack of Immunity:** He doesn't have \"founder control\" of TSLA. He actually can be removed, not saying he will or that he should, just stating it is possible. \n\n**False Promises:** He has a pending FSD lawsuit because - well, FSD is a complete lie. Its not even close and yet it is marketed AND SOLD as available. Many hundreds of thousands of people paid 10k for FSD, and it simply doesn't exist.  Where is the cyber truck? What is the deal with a robot 10 years behind Boston Dynamics and Honda? Bullet proof glass? Semi truck deliveries? Bigger than Apple and Aramco? \n\n**Free Speech:** The Twitter purchase removes the \"town square\" from the free speech arena. It is now private speech, controlled by one individual. It's also a huge distraction to his more meaningful missions at SpaceX, Tesla, Starlink, Boring Co etc - this alienates his investors and bankers across the \"real\" companies as he spends his time fixing the dumpster fires at a shit company.  \n\nI had another post on [TSLA as a stock losing its growth trajectory](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y1dtf7/tsla_is_dying/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), and I recommended [everyone sell calls](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y8ehch/tesla_just_ended_the_rally/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) which everyone criticized but turned into gains for me. \n\nI have a Tesla, its a great car. I have starlink. I want people to go to Mars. Personally, I fully support Elon and couldn't care less what type of \"person\" he is - but that is not the climate we are in today. \n\nWhat do you guys think the chances are of Elon being socially \"cancelled\" - or there at least being an attempt - in the next 12 months? Is his popularity and influence fading along with his market cap? Can Elon be cancelled?", "id": "yf2hmj", "created_utc": 1666902610.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.34, "num_comments": 108, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|19|**First Seen In WSB**|2 years ago\n**Total Comments**|397|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y8e6uy/tsla_just_killed_the_rally/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y8ebhy/tsla_just_ended_the_rally/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y8ehch/tesla_just_ended_the_rally/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y470da/spy_last_three_days_explained/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xn2wn6/how_to_win_the_week_of_926/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xrtkjs/the_bull_case_for_oil/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xurrbx/tsla_time_to_sell_calls/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading_spy_next_9_days/) \n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=yf2hmj)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=yf2hmj)\n    \n>TL;DR: Can Elon be cancelled?", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Lmao bro this is WSB not politics", "score": 29, "replies": [{"body": "I was trying to not be political, but pretty sure I failed", "score": -22, "replies": [{"body": "“Trump was the greatest president of all time” lmao", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "Lord.
