At least in most cases.\n\nLet me give you a hypothetical situation:\n\nMain Street Investments Private Equity calls around to various pensions.  The pension fund manager for United apple pickers union 894 finds out Main Street is starting a \"roll-up\". A roll-up will take, say, $1B and buy Nebraska Widget company for $200M, which is strong, profitable company.  They will then buy Wyoming Widget Company, which is much smaller, and buy them for $10M.  They will merge Nebraska and Wyoming into one company and streamline expenses, firing redundant positions.  They will use Nebraska as a \"platform\" and continue to add on.\n\nThe pension gets a dividend from the combined profits as well as a dividend on the debt ($10M is a loan given to Nebraska to buy Wyoming that it has to pay back). So returns are higher than just the profit.\n\nEventually the roll-up will end and the EBITDA of Nebraska will double or triple.  The overall valuation will lead to a higher multiple.  The private equity can then take them public or sell them to another holder, many times to another Private Equity, which will do more rolling up.  Or Nebraska will be part of an entire portfolio of companies and the portfolio is sold.  \n\nLikewise, the Private equity can go long and continue to hold the company and reap the dividends, but this is less likely.\n\nEither way, higher risk-free rates make it harder for PE to exceed those rates.  As such, PE transactional velocity slows, but generally speaking the companies remain profitable and still provide market-neutral returns.  \n\nTaking this \"to the masses\" which is what I think you alluding to with Cathy Wood is incredibly stupid because the amount of vetting at every level that has to happen is beyond the scope of an ETF company.  And most private equities have a dubious overall effect to both customers and employees.  \n\nI have been involved with multiple transactions involving private equity and they make it harder to do your job, service your clients, and accounting ends up running the companies.  Co-workers get canned and MBA's end up in positions formerly held by people with actual industry experience.\n\nFocused private REITs are generally better than corporatifying formerly small to mid size profitable companies and squeezing every amount of profit you can.\n\nThe vetting and organization of the acquiring PE firm is vital.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you for your super duper long reply.

Even with all of that there is no argument the damage done was second only *to* the great depression.\n\nThe federal govt almost made off with the greatest financial miracle on wallstreet- curbing a depression. Instead in 2019 the presidential administration pressured the treasury to reverse the first moves to increase interest and balance the QE debt in over a decade to keep the market green for the election.\n\nSo, before the govt could ever let off any of the whiplash, the deflation built up over that entire time that they were planning on releasing at market peaks, we had a second global crash, made worse by an overextended market.\n\nThe response? Go nuclear and give helicopter money. Second most dangerous move behind negative interest. And we got the 2021 bubble from it. Well now the bubble is gone, but QE never ended and now the feds have $8.6 trillion in assets to release along with the rapid termination of ZIRP to prevent freefall from the helicopter money.\n\nWanna know what it's like to get the deflationary pressure of 2 of the worst drops in history slapped in your face while the US gov't is too broke to step in like literally every V recovery?\n\nThey dun kicked the can off the road and down the cliffside.

That's fucking absurd. It'd be like raising interest rates to 20% and still getting an average inflation rate of 5% for a decade. The market was so depressed it could barely be held back.

Feds have to cut off the reserve soon, and the sauds are making it very clear they're about to gouge oil prices. Gas will surge again, the pressure on inflation will be big. And no, there is no solving this one peacefully. The west has made it clear they're going to be cutting oil subsidies and shifting to alternative energy and electic power. In the US, returns on those investments are only expected at minimum in 2030, meaning the higher oil prices will stick and it will drive up inflation. Easily leaves the market bearish to stagnant over the next 6 months to a year.\n\nThe elephant in the room, QT. The federal govt have made clear that soon QT will be reontroduced because that debt risks devaluing the dollar further. They *wanted* to do big QT cuts at market peaks, but the way I see it the next few years won't have those.\n\nIt'll be a slow burn for QT and thus any bull markets will be slow and fragile. Closing out 8 Trillion in debt takes time, so this pressure could sit on the US for years if not a solid decade or two.\n\nThere's then the foreign trade problem. China and the EU are dealing with a lot of shit I won't get into, but the fsct that the US is propping other financial systems means it is vulnerable in the eyes of market makers and investors. Foreign markets are a better bet once they stabilize first, ergo money taken from the US to invest overseas. The US is at risk of dropping to their level, ergo invest foreign to hedge against US market drops.\n\nOn a slightly positive note housing is going down. By how much will depend on the mortgage rate. If the labor market gets really badly hit by this recession it could heavily drop prices below just the interest ratio.\n\nOverall, I see the next 3 years switching between bearish and flat, with small bull rides as we overcome milestones and give institutions confidence in the feds navigation.

{"title": "Mark Zuckerberg admits he missed a giant shift in social networking", "selftext": "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg failed to anticipate a newer trend in social networking that contributed to the success of rival TikTok. In an interview published Wednesday in analyst Ben Thompson‚Äôs Statechery newsletter, the Facebook founder said he ‚Äúsort of missed‚Äù a newer way that people ‚Äúinteract with discovered content‚Äù via social networking services. People are increasingly using their social networking ‚Äúfeeds‚Äù to discover compelling content as opposed to viewing the media shared by the friends that they follow, he explained. Although people still interact with content that their friends share in their feeds, the overall social networking trend has ‚Äúby and large shifted to you use your feed to discover content, you find things that are interesting, you send them to your friends in messages and you interact there,‚Äù Zuckerberg said. ‚ÄúSo in that world, it is actually somewhat less important who produces the content that you‚Äôre finding, you just want the best content,‚Äù the Facebook founder said. (Facebook changed its corporate name to Meta last year.)\n\nAnalysts have attributed TikTok‚Äôs rapid rise in popularity to its algorithm, which can recommend compelling short videos to users based on their habits and viewing history. TikTok‚Äôs rise has posed a significant challenge to the company, which is experiencing a decline in North American Facebook users, and a stock price that‚Äôs lost more than 56% this year so far.\n\nZuckerberg referred to TikTok as a ‚Äúvery effective competitor‚Äù during the interview and acknowledged that the company was ‚Ä≥somewhat slow to this because it didn‚Äôt fit my pattern of a social thing, it felt more like a shorter version of YouTube to me,‚Äù he said. Zuckerberg also believes it‚Äôs important for Meta to develop AI that can recommend a range of content including photos and text to users besides just short videos.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/13/mark-zuckerberg-said-he-missed-a-giant-shift-in-social-networking.html", "id": "y40e8o", "created_utc": 1665769475.0, "score": 395, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 224, "comments": [{"body": "More of these people should be like Tom from MySpace.

However, as a safety feature, the car won‚Äôt stay locked if the fob is in the car (using the button on the door). \nSo here‚Äôs the thing; VW had the ‚Äúsign & drive‚Äù deal going on at the time, which required zero money down if you had good credit. My credit was 750 or higher, so I qualified, but I still chose to put 5k down payment, which made my payments only $122.00 a month for 3 years. \nFF about 6 months, the fob started getting stuck in the slot. Like stuck, stuck. You could press it in to turn the car off, but it wouldn‚Äôt release the fob, and the fob was the only way to lock the car once you got out. I‚Äôd get stuck in grocery store parking lots, work in the morning, etc. it happened at random times. \nOf course for the first 3-4 times I took it into VW service, they‚Äôd say: couldn‚Äôt replicate customer complaint. üôÑ\nUntil one day, after about the 6th time of me taking it in within the first 2 years, they said again they didn‚Äôt find a problem. Told me to come get my car. As I‚Äôm standing in the service customer service area waiting for them to bring my car up, the service tech drives it into the bay, turns off the car, and BAM!

We will need to keep it longer. üòÇ\nAnyway, due to the Lemon Law, I got a lawyer, she filed the claim.
