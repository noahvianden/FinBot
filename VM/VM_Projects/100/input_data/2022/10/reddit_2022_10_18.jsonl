I think this recession has really shown some cracks in META's foundation.  While Zuck is trying hard for a pivot, that pivot is years away - look at current metaverse numbers actual numbers are not meeting predicted numbers.  That journey will be extremely expensive, and I am not sure it will catch on so that is a huge gamble.  I think while their user base is huge, I think their numbers of active users  has slowed. I joined the platform less than 2 years from releasing to the public, so I am a very long time users.  I have noticed that my news feed is showing less and less activity of my friends... when I check their profile, they haven't posted in a while... so I have taken the time to call a few of them and I get \"yeah, kind of over the BS of FB.\" so with all the political crap, the censorship crap - a large slice of their users are over it.  So they are using FB to post memories or photos they want to keep... but the interaction is slowing.  They also have missed a generation, my daughter is 22, and has never had a FB account - her statement is \"FB is for Boomers\"... Next to last, by now they should be paying dividends and AMZN is my only non-paying dividend stock I own. Finally, I don't like that the board is there for fluff, they have no power, Zuck can't be fired or even told what to do, and that is a bad thing nearing the end of a long run and this company has had a long long run.\n\nAMZN was a simple growth buy for me a while back, and my first non paying dividend stock since the dot com timeframe... I bought 200 at 116.97 right after their split.  The reason for my buy:  If they offered a tiered levels based on customer loyalty like Dillards use to offer a black card membership to anyone spending $5000 in their department stores in a year, my wife would surpass the highest levels - get the point?  Second, I  have been both a consumer of their AWS platforms through one of my companies, and another company I owned as a vendor on AMZN, so I have been what I would call a super user of AMZN.  While I think Azure will be the long term winner, AMZN will be sitting in 2nd for a long time.  There platform is very solid, but lacks the Office 365 and Dynamics that solidifies MSFT as the ultimate corporate cloud provider. While I wasn't a Bezos fanboy, I admit they have had and do have decent leadership.  The iRobot purchase makes perfect sense for their vision of being a major player in smart homes.  I also, however, see very strong headwinds from the Fed possibly wanting to split them up.  Although I think these headwinds could be bad for the stock initially,  the long term on that is tremendous if they are split or not...  I know, some just went huh?

Just a week ago, President Joe Biden said a recession in the U.S. was unlikely and said any such downturn would be “very slight” if it did occur.\n\nBloomberg Economics’ latest statistical projections showed a 100% probability of a recession within the next 12 months as the U.S. economy contends with decades-high inflation, Federal Reserve interest-rate hikes and mounting geopolitical tensions.\n\nThe likelihood of a recession was 65% in the Bloomberg model’s most recent previous update. Generated by economists Anna Wong and Eliza Winger, the model utilizes 13 macroeconomic and financial indicators to assess the odds of a downturn from one month to two years in the future.\n\nA separate Bloomberg survey of 42 economists predicts the probability of a recession over the next 12 months now stands at 60%, up from 50% a month earlier.\n\nThe Bloomberg Economics model showed a 25% probability of a recession hitting even sooner — within the next 10 months — up from 0% in the previous release.\n\nFears of a deep recession have surged in recent months as the Fed hikes interest rates in a bid to cool inflation. Investors believe the Fed risks “overtightening” monetary policy in reaction to higher prices and driving the economy into a sustained downturn.\n\nSegments of the U.S. economy, such as the housing market, have shown signs of struggle.\n\nThe Fed has implemented supersized three-quarter-point interest-rate hikes at each of its last three meetings, with a fourth major increase expected when monetary-policy makers hold a two-day meeting Nov. 1–2. Despite the rate hikes, inflation ran at a hotter-than-expected 8.2% in September.\n\nBiden, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and others have downplayed concerns about the economic outlook for months.\n\n“I don’t think there will be a recession. If it is, it will be a very slight recession. That is, we’ll move down slightly,” Biden said during an interview with CNN last week.\n\n“Look, it’s possible” he added. “I don’t anticipate it.”\n\nYellen has suggested the central bank, which she led in 2014–18, would need both skill and luck to pilot the economy toward something other than a hard landing.\n\nU.S. GDP has declined for two straight quarters — a rule-of-thumb definition of a recession. But the National Bureau of Economic Research, a key economy tracker, has yet to formally declare one is underway.\n\nA separate Bloomberg survey of 42 economists puts the probability of a recession over the next 12 months at 60%, up from 50% a month earlier\n\n\nhttps://www.marketwatch.com/story/100-probability-of-u-s-recession-in-next-12-months-according-to-new-forecast-11666051473?mod=mw_latestnews", "id": "y79r6v", "created_utc": 1666105962.0, "score": 4434, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 847, "comments": [{"body": "Why not make it 200%?", "score": 1417, "replies": [{"body": "Pretty easy to predict when you’re already in a recession", "score": 215, "replies": [{"body": "The house is burning and I’m selling fire insurance!", "score": 50, "replies": [{"body": "Oh uh... then yeah I'll take it", "score": 6, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Exactly what I was thinking.

With all of the supply chain issues, combined with chip production issues and costs, it seems to me that rereleasing essentially the same product as an “updated version” may simply be a desperate attempt to maintain revenue despite hurdles in creating actual upgrades. An assumption that it’s deliberate in order to start a trend toward “sustainability” in an industry that has led the charge in fast release, quick replacement electronics seems optimistic in a magnitude bordering on delusional.

That’s apple changing the paradigm and letting consumers know that upgrades won’t happen at the same rate and we are reaching saturation. For an iPhone X owner, this would feel like a good upgrade. Sure they could upgrade to 13 for $100 cheaper, but why not 14 just for $100 more with a few additional features. \n\nTo clarify, my whole point is that the target is the 3 years old iPhone owners and it is very clear and not even hidden from Apple marketing and presentation. \n\nRants about how expensive it is (not at all in the US compared to other flagships),\nthere are no new features anymore (of course there aren’t, smart phones have saturated), \nhow Apple is milking customers (of course they do try to find any way possible and true for any other successful company) kinda get boring after a while.

A put is the opposite. In reality, a call option gives you the right to purchase 100 shares per each contract at the strike price if you hit above it. So if Netflix goes up to $300, op has the option to buy 100 shares at his strike price of $270 before it expires on 10/21. So you would automatically make $3,000 per each contract owned in this hypothetical scenario. What most people here do is disregard exercising the contract option to obtain shares at a lower price and take advantage of the volatility that stocks like Netflix experience during earnings. If op had a call on Netflix for say $250 expiring 10/21 and the stock maintains $270 before expiration, he would get $100 for each $1 the stock price increased and, since op had 6 contracts on Netflix he would automatically get $600 for each $1 over $250 and would stand to earn at least $12,000 if the stock stays above $270 in this scenario.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Under the call what do the number of buys/sell mean?
