They therefore invest is what is available to them: real estate. The issue is that by creating an environment in which this was the only solidly-perceived asset to invest in, construction companies took advantage of this and started selling construction projects before even digging the foundations, and instead of using the money from the down-payments and the financial commitments to secure loans to start construction, these companies instead used that money to secure more land, to sell more unstarted projects, so they could then buy more land, to sell more unstarted projects, etc. That is what caused some of the big panic about a potential economic collapse in China. These companies had borrowed way too much, and were nowhere near finished on any of their construction projects, but were also out of money, and the banks wouldn't lend them any more. The people got upset that they had been waiting for years just for the projects to get started, or resume in the rare cases in which they were started, because in the meantime they were still paying interests and insurance on their loans. So they organized and collectively decided to stop paying their mortgages until construction resumed. At the same time, some banks who had presented investment accounts as regular deposit accounts, and heavily invested in these construction companies suddenly found themselves having to refuse withdrawals and transactions to their customers because they simply didn't have the money anymore. Both because of people no longer paying mortgages, and mainly the companies they had invested so much in not making any return on their investments. That's how we got protests outside banks with armed response from the government. All of this to say: they were wrongly convinced that housing was the safest investment because historically it had performed better than their stock market because of political intervention and regulation. Yet, since so many were convinced of the same thing, they were easily abused by greedy people who took advantage of thousands of people and many banks to finance what is pretty much a massive ponzi scheme. Since it is so deeply engraved in their culture at this point, though, that owning land is important, this whole ordeal isn't enough to make them rethink that position, especially considering the Chinese stock market hasn't changed. All they can hope for is that by investing in property abroad it won't run into the same issues as it did in China, thanks to different regulations, culture, and incentives. It is important to note that the reason why this was enabled to happen in China despite locally regulated permets being required and conditioned to back-checks of the company before permitting purchase of a plot for construction and construction plans, the local bodies in charge of these controls had a vested interest in approving these despite the companies' history, because it meant more money for their local budgets. It was a form of legal bribery, if you will. \"You let me buy this land we both know I'm never going to finish building on—Maybe I'll dig the foundations to make it look like something is happening—and in return, you receive a few million Yuan for next year's budget to either help build infrastructure for your town, or increase your staff's wages, or just give yourself a fat bonus in the form of fancy restaurants or whatever you like.\" This also only applies when not buying finished homes. In the context of these big Canadian cities, if they're investing so heavily, it is because it's already done. The value is already realized, they just have to wait for it to go up as other people tag along.  \n\n\nTL;DR: Sorry I lost focus somewhere in there. Point is: Chinese stock market is garbage, real estate was their only solid investment, but that led to them relying too heavily on it, and almost killing their economy. Despite that, it is too heavily engrained in their culture, and there is still no better alternative in China.

The peg used to be at 1.20 Swiss Francs per euro, now there is parity between the two currencies. This has turned out to be a burden for various sectors in Switzerland, especially tourism and export-oriented industries, which is why the SNB has been desperately trying to weaken the Franc by basically printing local currency and selling it for foreign currency (it has indeed chosen to invest a sizeable portion of its resulting foreign currency reserves into stocks instead of more, uh, traditional alleys for central banks to park their reserves, but this is a total detail and absolutely not relevant for anything we’re discussing here). Tellingly Switzerland for a long time has also been the only country (that I know of) to have a negative policy interest rate. \n\nSo you can clearly see that the actions of the SNB have not contributed to strengthening the local currency, in fact the opposite is true.
