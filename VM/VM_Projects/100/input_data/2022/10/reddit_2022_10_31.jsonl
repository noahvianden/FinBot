This isn't some 2020 meme stock, but a serious player in the ecommerce space. If you shop online with any frequency you're almost certainly using SHOP storefronts all the time.\n\nSHOP is building a platform around ecommerce in the same way a company like CRM built a platform around customer relation software. I'm not saying they're definitely going to scale like CRM, but this is a company which is being used by 20% of ecommerce sites already and is constantly adding new customers and new products to upsell those existing customers. If they continue to take market share while continuing to expand into areas like payments and fulfilment the potential here is huge. As in bigger than AMZN's ecommerce division with far better margins. Unlike a lot of innovative tech companies, this is one of the few that I think could achieve mega-cap status and be one of the big winners this decade.\n\nAnd before anyone says it, no, PE is not a good metric to value on the company on currently.\n\nSo I'd say SHOP, but honestly it depends on what you're looking for.\n\nWhile I think SHOP offers the best risk/reward at this point in time, PYPL is probably the safest near-term. I think long-term their business model is questionable given that the payment space is moving quickly and they don't have the kind of moat they used to, in fact PYPL is actually one of the companies SHOP could disrupt by integrating their own payment service into their ecommerce platform. I think PYPL is a company quite likely to go nowhere over the next decade while upside is limited given the scale. I don't think it's a bad investment though, I just think the base case is that it will market-perform.\n\nUPST is... interesting... I've done a lot of research on this one because I really like the team. The company is run by some very smart people who bring a innovative mindset to an industry with relatively little innovation. I'm fairly bullish on the company long-term and think it's probably undervalued here. But the issues here are major. Firstly they're now putting a significant number of loans on their balance sheet which they originally said they wouldn't do. But these aren't just any old loans, these are loans which they've originated based on their unproven lending models which dramatically increases the risk. And if that wasn't bad enough, they also seem to be explicitly targeting those with lower credit scores and who would be typically be refused loans by traditional lenders. So given the recession risk, I think this is just a really bad environment to own a company like UPST, regardless of valuation or potential. Until recession risk can be taken off the table I struggle to see the stock appreciating much and will struggle to ever achieve prior highs given the increased risks of its business model today. I also think that UPST claiming they were only holding loans on their balance sheet to test their models was basically securities fraud. They were obviously lying to investors and while I understand these kinds of pivots are both common and necessary in innovative startups, when you're a public company you simply can't mislead investors about the nature of your business in this way. So right now, I'm staying away. While I think they have a lot of potential and they have a very smart team behind them I don't currently have enough trust be an investor in them.

Banks may also cut back spending and put off investing in new software to help their core business.

{"title": "JPMorgan Chase wants to disrupt the rent check and money order with its payments platform for landlords and tenants", "selftext": "JPMorgan Chase is betting that landlords and tenants are finally ready to ditch paper checks and embrace digital payments. The bank is piloting a platform it created for property owners and managers that automates the invoicing and receipt of online rent payments, according to Sam Yen, chief innovation officer of JPMorgan‚Äôs commercial banking division. While digital payments have steadily taken over more of the world‚Äôs transactions, boosted in recent years by the pandemic, there is one corner of commerce where paper still reigns supreme: the monthly rent check. That‚Äôs because the market is highly fragmented, with most of the country‚Äôs 12 million property owners running smaller portfolios of fewer than 100 units.\n\nAs a result, about 78% are still paid using old-school checks and money orders, according to JPMorgan. More than 100 million Americans pay a combined $500 billion annually in rent, the bank said. ‚ÄúThe vast majority of rent payments are still done through checks,‚Äù Yen said in a recent interview. ‚ÄúIf you talk to residents to this day, they often say ‚ÄòThe only reason I have a checkbook still is to pay my rent.‚Äô So there are lots of opportunities to provide efficiencies there.‚Äù\n\nJPMorgan has spent the past few years working on the software, called Story, which is meant to ultimately become an all-in-one property management solution. Besides having to manually collect paper checks and depositing them, landlords typically lean on decades-old software including Microsoft‚Äôs Excel and Intuit ‚Äôs QuickBooks to run their businesses, said Yen. Newer options more tailored to the real estate industry have appeared in recent years with names like Buildium and TurboTenant. None are dominant yet, according to the executive. Story will ‚Äúgive [property owners and managers] much more visibility across their entire portfolio to see exactly what‚Äôs been paid and what hasn‚Äôt been paid,‚Äù Yen said.\n\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/31/jpmorgan-chase-unveils-payments-platform-for-landlords-and-tenants.html", "id": "yibm7r", "created_utc": 1667221612.0, "score": 821, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 262, "comments": [{"body": "There are literally a million of these services already lol.

The thing about their investments is the metaverse has taken the spotlight but it‚Äôs a part of a whole AI strategy that I think would put them in the best position to be the dominant AI company the way Google is the dominant search engine and Amazon‚Äôs impressive growth of AWS. \n\nAside from all that, which are definitely uncertain, they still bring in incredibly large revenue, relatively* no debt (though I wish they‚Äôd have used debt vs shrinking their FCF) and still have users in the billions. Despite all this, Facebook isn‚Äôt their only app/site that brings in revenue, they still have potential for further revenue growth within instagram and WhatsApp is still barely monetized, which is in my opinion the largest point many (especially Americans) miss.

Some things I just want to add and throw out there. One of my primary reasons for liking meta so much is the fact that I believe there is a lot of improvements that can be made to recommendation. I think they are seeing this benefit which is the reason why they are investing so much into AI data centers to drive better relevancy in content and ads. Really, I can't think of another big tech company that has the potential to grow as much as Meta. Take google for example. Google recently has outpaced the growth of Meta which I believe was due to the apple privacy changes. The reason why Google wasn't as affected by privacy was because their ads are placed by keyword bidding. Not only this, but the intent of purchase is clear with a search, so you can definitely serve relevant ads without tracking the user's activity outside google. However, the one thing that is lacking here with google search is that I feel there is not that much room for improvement compared to Meta. You can't really recommend ads in the search bar that fall outside of what the user searched for. The value with recommendations is that Meta can recommend you things that you never even knew you wanted, and there is so much potential for improvement here since it's a much more difficult problem. Google already serves you what you searched for, but Google can't do the same thing where they serve you an ad for an item you didn't even know you wanted. Of course, I could be completely wrong lmao and if you think so let me know.\n\nMeta is my primary investment, but I definitely want to consider the bear case, and I've thought about a couple. I actually don't really pay much attention to the Metaverse, and I don't really care too much if it's successful or not successful. I think it's largely a distraction and idk why people are focusing on it so much. By the way, some people are saying that mark is steering the company towards the metaverse because he thinks that the advertising business is going to fail. This is simply not true. I have never seen anyone bring this up, but I looked at the q3 2014 earnings call transcript, where facebook had JUST acquired oculus. Literally back then mark stated in the call that his reasoning for this acquisition is the belief that VR will be the new computing platform of the future. He has literally been planning this since 2014, and he has said all the way back in 2014 that this is a bet that really won't materialize in the near future. Of course, whether Meta is successful with their VR ventures I really can't say, but people need to realize that this is not just some uncalculated decision made by mark. He's been planning this out for years in advance and has only just announced their vision last year. People are just finding a reason to hate meta and mark, and I think the primary reason for this is due to Mark Zuckerberg. I have a lot of respect for the guy and I think he's really smart, but I think his communication skill is lacking. He is just not a likeable person, and a lot of people invest based on their feelings. One of the other things I would watch for if I was you is the Apple app store guidelines. This week, apple basically announced that \"boosted\" posts on social media count as in-app transactions and are going to be taxed at 30%. From what I've seen, this will not have a material impact on facebook's revenue, but it may be potentially dangerous in the future if apple decides to further restrict meta in different ways. I don't see this as a major risk though because Apple can't really tax meta's main revenue source which is advertising. Advertising is different from boosted posts because boosted posts can be bought in app where advertising is \"bought\" in another platform. And facebook has a web platform for advertisers to buy campaigns, and there is no way Apple can tax that. Facebook does have an app for advertising, but if Apple decides to take a cut of that app, there is nothing stopping meta from getting rid of the app and redirecting people to their website to buy advertisements. That's actually how spotify/netflix bypass the apple tax. Anyways, I am continually researching Meta, and if there are any other negatives please bring them up. So far, I'm seriously thinking about buying more of Meta. I'm definitely holding them for the long term, but really this negative sentiment on meta has to improve.

The reason that Meta even needs to implement AI is because ATT changes means Meta no longer has access to ad revenue data. The reality is that probabilistic models are never as accurate as an appropriate deterministic model.  Deterministic model is one problem one solution. Probabilistic is one problem and an infinite number of possible solutions across some distribution or set of distributions. There is a high level of uncertainty when working with probabilistic models. Not only must one determine the correct models but also the relevant parameters which need to be fine tuned. Additionally, there must be an abundance of clean data to work with. Data on who should be targeted is accessible. I am not so sure that Meta even has access to data that could help them forecast ad conversion. It is the data that is most important. Again, AI will probably not improve their ad revenue. AI is mostly used as a substitute to deterministic models. Deterministic models almost always preferred. They had direct access to ad conversion data. Now they are using AI to attempt to guess at it.\n\nNot to mention the exorbitant costs associated with developing the appropriate algorithms, purchasing and maintaining the hardware that drives such algorithms, and the additional data centers required to store the needed data. The fact that their AI expenditures are so high is revealing. It's a nascent technology, and, as is with all nascent technologies, expenditures are underestimated and will balloon. Also, you can't just license that technology. AI isn't some blanket technology that works across all mediums with just some tinkering. Algorithms are very specific. Even if it were feasible, licensing this technology would mean Meta would lose its competitive edge. How is that beneficial?This is not even considering the unfavorable economic climate in which ad revenue always takes a hit. Also, does not consider the Metaverse which is an even bigger expenditure. At least they have a lot of cash to work with. Furthermore, the user base increasing does not necessarily equate to increased ad revenue. The user base is growing almost entirely in less developed countries. They have less to spend.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Meta's push to AI will generate more revenue by making ad targeting more personalized and better. ATT changes have definitely set Meta back a bit, but that is all the more reason to invest in AI to make ad targeting much better! Despite the ATT changes, Meta still has so much data to work with. The ATT mainly affected tracking conversions from the advertisers point of view. But that does not necessarily mean that the ad relevancy will take a huge hit, since Meta obviously still has access to clickstream behavior of its users on its own website. The ATT changes just limit them a bit so that they can't use third party data to track interaction from other websites. So while it is true that we no longer have conversion data to be absolutely certain whether a customer bought a product, there is still other avenues of data that are also very affective such as clickstream. I am not entirely sure I understand your explanation about deterministic vs probabilistic models, but even with ad conversion data, I would suspect that Meta would definitely use it as am important signal in their training data along with other signals like clickstream and other interactions. But in the end, the model developed is still predicting what ads/content the users would like to see, so in a way it is probabilistic I guess?  \nAnd for your second point, yes it definitely costs a lot of money to develop these AI models. But would a multibillion dollar company like Meta just decide to spend exhorbitant amounts of money for no reason? I don't think they are that dumb (hopefully). They are operating at such a huge scale where it makes sense to make these investments, because improving the AI algorithms will bring such a huge return on investment. I am not entirely sure if I agree with the statement that all nascent technologies have underestimated expenditures. So far in the AI field many of the models in the beginning (2013 alexnet) were much smaller and easier to train. It has only been in the recent years (like 2020-ish?) where AI has become more developed that we're seeing deeper and deeper models (think of the large language models like chatgpt, etc.). So I would say that over time the expenditures are going to be higher actually and much easier to underestimate costs, which is actually kind of bad for Meta. Nevertheless, they are probably a smart company and can adjust their investments accordingly when they don't see this return on investment. But the thing I want to point out is that these AI models are pretty much common knowledge. It is not difficult to rebuild one of these models, but the real competitive edge that Meta has is their gigantic amounts of data and (as of now) their large-scale data centers. This will enable them to build models bigger and better than anyone else, and they are the only ones able to do this because they have so much data from instagram and facebook, even without the conversions being tracked because that is just one signal of many in the training process. Their data is also different from other platforms like youtube and tiktok because content on meta is multimodal text, image, video, etc.  \n\n\nSo I think the final point I want to make is that although AI will see diminishing rates of return on investment in the future (more compute resources to train bigger models), I still believe Meta has a lot of room for improvement and growth in making their targeted ads/content better. I really don't know when we will reach a point where investing in AI no longer makes sense, but it's definitely not now.

Also, I didn't mean to say ALL nascent technologies have cost overruns. Of course there are exceptions. But it's usually true. And how will they adjust their investments?

This is a very simplified take and I'm sure they have many many more signals to work with. Ok also I guess I should take a step back, it's not THAT common knowledge to building a recommendations system. But what I think I was trying to get at is that even if you use the state of the art models from the most recent research (which changes very often), most of what sets you apart from others is the data and compute power.

Financially, 4% down revenue isn‚Äôt bad as it‚Äôs 2% up on constant currency basis, and they expect that headwind to be eased by Q1 2023. Most of the expenses were up because of layoffs and major architectural changes (halting or modifying construction projects for data centers and offices). In terms of average users I don‚Äôt care because Meta isn‚Äôt a growth company anymore, and a quarter of the human population use one of their services in some way. But seeing a bit of growth there is good especially considering the past quarter. \n\n\nI had three big takeaways from the earnings and call. First was Mark‚Äôs shift in tone from aggressively funding Reality Labs to toning it down, focus on cost saving and efficiencies, and restructuring of the personnel bloat. RL is still gonna be at a loss for the upcoming year but isn‚Äôt an issue if their FCF is more or less covering it. \n\n\nSecond big takeaway is their emphasis on monetizing Reels in the short term. They pushed that point aggressively imo in the call and said that Reels has grown at a good enough pace where the focus is now on monetizing that platform to be revenue neutral by year end and profitable by early next year. Reel engagement doubled year on year, and resharing reels doubled in the past 6 months. So I‚Äôm glad they‚Äôre pushing on monetizing that asap. \n\nThird was their mention of AI as part of Reality Labs and more specifically how they‚Äôve seen evidence within the ad space that their AI algorithm is able to bypass some negatives caused by the Apple privacy changes. If that‚Äôs the case, I think they‚Äôre in the forefront of the ad space in the coming few years in terms of Ad targeting. And Mark emphasized that the majority of Reality Labs investment was in AI, and secondarily in VR and the meta verse. So it‚Äôs good to see some ROI potential from the AI investment in the near term. \n\n\nOverall, I think it was a good call, and my personal opinion is if we go by the management‚Äôs tone, Meta is gonna be a wholly different company within the next two years.

By developing better and better targeting algorithms, you not only improve the relevancy of the ads to get users to convert more, but you also are able to keep people on your website for longer periods of time! Wall street is too focused on the numbers and is only looking in the short term. Meta can just choose to cast aside all of their capex spending and still operate with what they have right now and produce record breaking profits. But they choose not to, which is great to see because it means they aren't focused on near term profits. In my opinion, Meta will probably be the BIGGEST beneficiary of the growth in AI. All of their products are centered around recommending people things, and recommendations can be improved so much because it's such a difficult problem. I like to compare Meta to its tech buddies like Google for example. Google is also a big proponent in AI, but they don't have as much room to grow as Meta. The reasoning is that YT is a small portion of their revenue and is not as profitable since they have to pay their creators. Improving Google search, which is their main source of revenue and profit, is relatively more difficult than Meta I believe. It is very difficult to personalize and improve google search results, because people search for what they want and they expect to see it there. You cannot target people with ads that are not relevant to the search query. So while Google can improve their search relevancy using AI, they do not have as much room for improvement when compared to Meta. Meta can recommend things that you didn't even know you wanted!

Going to smaller and smaller devices can improve yields because a given product can be fit in a smaller area, meaning you can fit more successful products between the random defects that develop. There is no real technical impossibility of any of the high end manufacturers making 3nm chips. EUV isn't even a strict requirement, though the yields without it would be atrocious. I'm pretty sure IBM announced that they had made a 3 nm pitch die back in like 2016. The trick is getting the yields high enough to economically begin manufacturing at scale. So, rest assured, TSMC, Samsung, and Intel have all made 3 nm chips. TSMC and Samsung being Asian fabs do have a lower threshold to meet of yields to achieve profitability.

{"title": "Airbnb earnings scheduled for tomorrow AM. Co-founder has sold off half of his remaining shares since previous quarter. Time to delete the app. It is as worthless as Facebook, excuse me, Meta.", "selftext": "Airbnb, we all know it, we all have used it in the past (when it was cool). But now, if you have traveled any within the last year or two, you know that fees are tearing this company apart. It used to be cheaper to rent an airbnb compared to a hotel for the longest time. No one liked going to hotels and they were actually disrupting the hotel industry. But now, with all of the service fees, and CLEANING fees which are sometimes 100-110% of the nightly rate.\n\nFor example, here is a nightly rental in Scottsdale, AZ. For $151 a night, I pay $139 cleaning fee and $41 service fee. So after fees, you are paying effectively a 119% premium on your rental just to stay somewhere other than a hotel. Who would do that? and why? Not to mention you have to clean the place yourself, and basically do the home maker's job, because if you don't your rep gets hit. Its an absolute joke of a company now.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hd3muojqm6x91.png?width=744&format=png&auto=webp&s=e59b111482ca40e835e93f16c70bbb87b5866ab2\n\nSo then after looking into maybe I am just biased because I hate paying these people to make me clean, I did a simple google trends search. Searches for \"airbnb\" on google actually peaked the first week of this previous quarter in July. And since then have been plummeting to nearly Dec lows. So maybe its inflation, maybe its fees, who knows but this can't be good for bookings.\n\n[YTD chart of \\\\\"airbnb\\\\\" searches](https://preview.redd.it/4a5ti97kn6x91.png?width=2308&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f1e6193e6036377ee98f4b39f041c9eaa642ac1)\n\n[5 year chart of \\\\\"airbnb\\\\\" searches. Headed back to covid lows.](https://preview.redd.it/93bq5lbwo6x91.png?width=2298&format=png&auto=webp&s=d96b7e3ec6a780a92e0984f5b53d765746cdde34)\n\nBut then I do some more searching and I find this. Hosts are obv struggling to get bookings. Maybe its because your fees are insane!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/prndr35wn6x91.png?width=2032&format=png&auto=webp&s=d93c341f44fad279542269b1fd4f172ac39b98ab\n\nSo then I started I got my crayola crayons out and started looking at the chart. The chart has been in an obvious downturn since November 2021. We are in a pretty significant downtrend, and have been consolidating since the drop in December. Looking at this chart I would expect this flag we are in currently to snap to the downside and make a new leg down which would put us near $80 a share again. Which I feel is an appropriate value given the environment we are in.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/647nse4dp6x91.png?width=1269&format=png&auto=webp&s=1da4d592f19da06b579ada7ba0e479753a2e0739\n\nOnce I put my crayons up, I wanted to check and see what company directors and insiders have been doing with the stock considering we are near all time lows. You would think if the market for bookings and travel was expected to \"pick up\" given countries opening back up (Japan, Canada, etc.) that these insiders would be picking up stock at these cheap prices. Well... was I surprised.  Joseph Gebbia (co founder of Airbnb) was holding 2.75M shares at the beginning of Q3. He has no sold off 1.5M shares since the start of Q3, effectively cutting his position in half. FIFTY percent less than he had at the start. Sounds like someone has a confidence issue in his company's ability to disrupt the hotel industry.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f02i8nfup6x91.png?width=2778&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c7fd40a034d34b56a77c6188dbef9a64349b3a9\n\nAirbnb has been unable to manage fees like they have promised. They promised to \"look into it\". Nothing has changed, inflation has been destroying lower income families preventing people from taking vacations, and when they do, they are forced to go the cheaper hotel route option again. Which at the end of the day, you have less expectations as a guest, no cleaning, and sometimes even free breakfast. I am taking puts for these earnings tomorrow after close.\n\nI am holding $90 P 11/4 and $80 P 11/4. Wish me luck fellow regards. I have convinced myself this is the beginning of the end of Airbnb.
