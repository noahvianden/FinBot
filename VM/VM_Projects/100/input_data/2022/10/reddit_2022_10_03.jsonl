Fucker just pulled out a newspaper every weekend and looked for companies he was familiar with that were trading close to 52 week lows and sized up whether they were solid long term and pulled the trigger then moved on with his life.  Asked him about what he looks for on a balance sheet and he just trails off about, \"oh yeah sometimes I look at the balance sheet...\"  That's an accountant, he looks at balance sheets 40 hours a week, and he was a legit good account too, not just on some bullshit.  He had some losers for sure, companies that went under like Radio Shack and Circuit City but for every one of those he had a big winner that went crazy, like Pepsi or Microsoft.  Just reinvested dividends, scooped up splits and spin offs, built it all up over time, didn't try to out-market the market.

I was part of a few amateur rocket groups in the late 90's, early 2000's with many others that were working on projects for the original X-Prize like John Carmack, Aleta Jackson (RIP), ERPS and LPRS. Musk was involved when they started designing and prototyping early vehicles, this was when Armadillo Aero was ahead of nearly everyone else. Elon was definitely digging in during those days, and while he wasn't deep on the science, he understood enough to apply concepts to his design goals. He was most certainly NOT a rocket engineer, scientist or expert any more than I was. What Elon did successfully was put forth compelling business plans and sell the concept upstream to lure talent and funding. \n\nThe thing that pissed me off the most was in those early days, his company was years behind the other private space companies. There were companies with multiple generations of evolving prototypes already successfully tested, using Xprize winnings funds and rocket design subcontracts to fund their efforts, Elon was buddies with Michael Griffen, who was originally attempting to help Elon partner with the Russians hoping to obtain an ICBM for his company (reverse engineering), when that fell apart, Griffen was appointed NASA administrator and next thing you know, SpaceX was awarded a $400M contract to build rockets before SpaceX had even successfully flown a single rocket. While SpaceX had used significant internal funding, they managed to capture contracts (DARPA, DoD, NASA) that catapulted them past the other startups. Musk's goal of using as much \"off-the-shelf\" tech as possible while also focusing on vertical integration production was definitely a factor in their success / development speed that their competitors couldn't hope to keep up with using traditional Aerospace development methods. \n\nIt was really Tom Mueller (another early ERPS/LRPS contributor and Reaction Research Society member) that was the brains of early SpaceX. Tom was the designer and brains behind TRW's TR-106 hydrogen rocket engine. Without Mueller, SpaceX would never have got off the ground as Tom brought much of his TRW staff over to SpaceX. The Merlin engine is basically a baby TR-106 with more off the shelf parts. \n\nSo, TLDR, Musk was definitely directly involved in some early design goals and decisions, but Mueller was the brains, Elon didn't actually design anything outside of napkin diagrams and scribbles, nor did he fabricate a damned thing.", "score": 18, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I honestly don’t think I’ve seen a single person defend Elon musk on this website in years", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "r/elonmusk don't say nobody warned ya, some of the saddest simps around over there", "score": 35, "replies": [{"body": "r/teslamotors still has a ton of people falling for the grift.", "score": 27, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "In years??

It would have been far easier for the established automakers to get to that point due to already having a lot of capacity and the capital to build out the rest, but they never saw the value in it until Tesla showed it was possible. They could have absolutely been making money with decent EVs well before Tesla became profitable if they'd actually invested in the tech and resources instead of dipping their toes into the idea with niche vehicles and then giving up, but they didn't.

Otherwise, the conversation can very easily veer off into flamewars and boring, unproductive, discussion.\n\nHere's an example of a political comment that doesn't offer any value:\n\n* \"I hate this new green policy from the Biden administration.
