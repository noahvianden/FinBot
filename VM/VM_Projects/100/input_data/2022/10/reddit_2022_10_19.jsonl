He even released Tesla patents for fair use for anyone. He is a dick of a person, but he has vision and drive that other company CEO's lack. VW's ex-CEO Herbert Diess was inspired by Tesla's success, and made big moves to transition VW to electric. He was ousted by the VW board, because their old business model was threatened. Ford's Jim Farley is also doing good things, but at a much slower rate than Tesla.  \nYou should note a couple of things: Tesla does not advertise. Ford and GM each spends $3 billion per year on advertising. That is money that goes to media such as newspapers, magazines and websites. So mainstream media (such as The Washington Post article you quoted) is inherently threatened by a car company such as Tesla that spends $0 with them.

I have not heard this.\n\nThe first electric semi is being delivered December 1. Delayed, but not vapourware.\n\nThe Thailand cave submarine option was requested by the Thai government as a backup to the main plan. Plan A worked, so the sub was never required. Not a broken promise. The subsequent twitter was between Musk and one of the divers was obscene on both sides, but especially Musk's.\n\nRobotaxis are a consequence of FSD.

Whether or not it becomes useful in 2023 remains to be seen.

Either that or once he realized that he couldn't make the goal he decided to raise the price far higher than his increased cost. And before you say something about how EV cost went up more, no other EV or hybrid went up by 25%.\n\nThe Truck being rolled out in December probably will because no company is dumbest enough to wait until a month before to admit they won't make it. The others, who knows. We will have to wait and see but arbitrary promises and release dates prove nothing.\n\nAs for my claim of his engineering team saying they can't do: I read that a few years back and can no longer fight it.

Specifically, look at Las Vegas.  It was a prime example of the flaw in your assertion that housing would be cheap if only the pesky government would get out of the way.\n\nIn the early 2000s Las Vegas was one of the fastest growing cities.  Builders couldn't build houses fast enough.  Eventually the builders built so many houses that they had built more than there was demand.  Builders didn't keep building houses no one would buy, as this tied up their capital and labor on projects they wouldn't be able to quickly turn around.  Building basically stopped once the demand threshold was crossed.  Housing prices came down for a while to liquidate the excess inventory.  Many of the vacant properties were bought up as Air BnBs and other investment properties.\n\nThis same cycle has happened time and time again all over the world.  A few more examples you could check out if you're feeling up for a research project.  Phoenix, Arizona.  Austin, Texas.  \n\nI'm not saying better zoning and planning wouldn't help with high housing prices.  I'm saying the interests of those with the means to produce more housing won't keep building houses past a certain point, because it isn't as profitable for them.\n\nThere is also a realistic limit to how many houses can be built.  This is simple math to be used as an example, not real world numbers.  Say you have 100 home builders in a city, who can build 1000 homes in a year.  There are 1200 people who need homes.  An REIT comes along and buys up all the existing home inventory at an inflated price.  Now you have 200 people who want homes and can't find them because the builders can only build a limited number of homes in a given period of time.  The 200 people who need a place to live now have no choice but to rent from the REIT, at an inflated market value.  Had the REIT not purchased the existing home inventory, there would have been plenty of homes for everyone to purchase with the existing homes and new construction.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "But you seem to be advocating a system where we build way more houses than we actually need to shelter people.

Rates are at 5%, consumers ran out of disposable income/savings, Tesla lost the \"wow\" factor, all other competitors are in the space now.\n* I told you to sell calls: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xurrbx/tsla\\_time\\_to\\_sell\\_calls/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xurrbx/tsla_time_to_sell_calls/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n* I told you tesla growth story was dying: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y1dtf7/tsla\\_is\\_dying/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y1dtf7/tsla_is_dying/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nIf you bought calls, enough the down move, but look to be adding puts at the 200 price level. I recommend selling the -190/+180 put spread to balance out the sold calls. If you are bullish in Tesla (why tho?) then just sell those puts because IV is going to be crazy in the AM if we gap down hard as expected .\n\n**Which Week is Best to Trade on Tesla?**\n\nHere is a custom chart I made for you. Let's review the implied volatility in Tesla over the next 10 weeks. As you can hopefully see in this chart, IV for calls is higher than puts! It is all you dumbasses bidding up the calls. I highly encourage anyone holding calls to sell, and if you are not long calls, then start shorting them. **4 weeks out** has great liquidity, high volume, tight spreads. That is where you want to be.\n\nüì∑\n\n[Tesla vol by week](https://preview.redd.it/mrzea7z5vtu91.png?width=1899&format=png&auto=webp&s=83ee6d62233567ff7059fe42ef06cf49fb2cfb2b)\n\nVolatility and Volume x Week\n\n**Which Strike is Best to Trade on Tesla?**\n\nHere is another custom chart I made for you guys. The \"lighter\" colored lines represent Black Scholes and what the options \"should\" be priced at. The solid color lines are the real prices.\n\nIn looking at this chart you can see that, because of our collective stupidity, IV for calls is higher than puts (people are dumb and buying calls). Conclusion, sell calls!When we look at the strikes we can see there is a lot of volume and liquidity at the nice round numbers like 190,200,210, 220.\n\nIf you are selling options, sell those that are overpriced (OTM puts and ITM calls) and buy those that are underpriced (ITM puts and OTM calls)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Tesla vol by Strike](https://preview.redd.it/peaelflbvtu91.png?width=1909&format=png&auto=webp&s=ec4b7af3c77c2a37e7e2fb065bed9bbce7894daa)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Tesla going to 200 this week, breaking through it probably next week.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hbqffozevtu91.png?width=1526&format=png&auto=webp&s=2634baa5688da4587bdebc6eba04e3a089fdac2c\n\nTesla is starting the long road down\n\n**And now to the overall market.**\n\nTesla earnings just killed all hopes of a sustained rally. Our lord and savior Elon has forsaken the market with the elevated valuation that now has to come back to earth.\n\nWe are going to sell off next few days, at least till Friday, and this is why:\n\n* 10 year rates new high:\n* 2 year rates new high:\n* Dollar nearing highs:\n* Crude on the rise again (nice try Biden)\n\nAnd remember, we just had a meaningless rally after an AWFUL CPI report.

Many investors limited the impact on their valuation models for FSD to begin with. Myself my assumption was maybe around 2025. Basically, until they show a final product I really don't think many place a high value on this.\n\nChina, Berlin, Deliveries - They are ramping production nicely. Seems the 50% target annual growth rate is overall being met.

{"title": "My 1987 Crash Experience", "selftext": "So a lot of people asked me to recount this, God knows why, but I'm happy to do it if I can get it done before the Astros game.\n\nIn 1987 I was at UT, having just finished my freshman year. I was interested in the markets, so I applied for an internship with Dean Witter.\n\nThey didn't take anyone who wasn't going into their junior year, but the broker who was looking (Ken) really dug my interview and recommended me to the manager for a second interview, because he wanted to go against the custom to get me.\n\nThat interview is a whole other story but when he asked \"why shouldn't I give you this position\", my answer was \"because if you do, one day I'll take your job\". He was aggressive, loved that, and let Ken hire me.\n\nI went in after class three days a week and made cold calls and stuff. It wasn't selling, that wasn't legal because I had no license. I was gathering information and trying to get people to talk to Ken. \n\nI was good at it and into it. My parents bought me some ties and nice shirts and slacks and so forth, and I dug in hard. I was putting up big numbers.\n\nKen was a giant broker with his own little suite in the office on one end. Had his own reception area, conference room, and giant office. He was also as cool a 40 year old dude as my 18 year old ass had ever met. \n\nAnyway, one day I get out of class and head to the office as per usual.\n\nI walk in and there are women running everywhere, literally like the building was on fire. I thought there was a plumbing leak, fire, or fight or something. Back then we didn't think about active shooters.\n\nAs I walk past the empty reception desk I see the first glass-walled office and this older dude, probably my current age (55) literally sitting at his desk crying like a fat kid who dropped his ice cream. I mean sobbing audibly through the window.\n\nI turn right to head to Ken's office suite and I see the same. Guys screaming into their headsets (we had wires attached to our phones back then), some crying, and the assistants running around. \n\nI found out the pneumatic tubes we used to send orders (they were handwritten on tickets back then) were overloaded and broken. They were running orders to the cage for processing.\n\nI get to Ken's office and walk in and he's on he phone and he literally waves his hand at me and screams \"GET THE FUCK OUT!!!!!\"\n\nI'm in complete shock.\n\nI go to leave and his assistant runs past me back to his office and I keep going to the door.\n\nShe runs back and grabs me and says \"wait... he needs you to call all these people and tell them to relax and answer the phone because Ken's gonna call them soon.\"\n\nShe hands me his \"B book\", which is the way he kept his clients. They were on paper with ticket copies behind each person's page. They were arranged usually by size of account and activity. He was calling the \"A book\" and I was letting the B people know he was going to get with them.\n\nSo the actual Dean Witter computer system got overwhelmed and pseudo-crashed.\n\nWhen we were placing orders they were coming back all fucked up in batches. So 10 people would sell IBM, and the trades were so fast and furious and everyone was selling that you couldn't match a sale to a ticket.\n\nAt the end of the day the floor sent us massive notices that said shit like \"your branch sold 10,000 shares of IBM at $100 (no idea if that was the price - just an example), 8,000 at $90, 15,000 at 87 5/8 (that's the way the prices used to be, in 1/8s), and 23,000 at 84.\" \n\nWe all met in the conference room (I was there to find Ken's client pages when he asked for them) and literally, I shit you not, argued over who would get what price for which client.\n\nThe manager would say \"we've got 27,000 shares of Dell at 4 and 5/8 gone, 18,000 at 3 7/8, and 50 thousand at 2 7/8. Make your pitch.\"\n\nKen would say \"I need 10,000 of those at 4 5/8. My guy has 2.4 million with us, he's been my client for 5 years, and he fucking deserves it.\"\n\nThen other guys would ask for shares and the manager would ask who they were for and why they should get them.\n\nWe were there all night. These guys cussed each other, cussed the manager, threw shit, stormed out and came back... it was a fucking war.\n\nBasically the bigtime brokers got the best prices, and they gave their best prices to their best customers.\n\nThe thing is, that practice is illegal. It's called allocating trades. It what made Hillary Clinton a PILE of money in futures. She always got the lowest buy price and the highest sale. Not in that crash, way later. Long story but check it out.\n\nAnyway, that was all kinds of fuckery. Guys quit over it. If the manager didn't like you, your customers got raped.\n\nSo we were there fighting for pricing til like 9 or 10, and calling clients to deliver the bad news until almost 1 a.m.\n\nSo that sucked, but the weirdest was yet to come.\n\nKen asked me to skip class the next day to help him call everyone he couldn't get ahold of, help the assistant field incoming calls, and work the paperwork for his books. I did it. Screw it. This was gonna be my career.\n \nI get there at like 7:30 and there are two effing armed guards at the double doors, which were closed and locked. \n\nI ask if we're closed (I just assumed the whole firm had gone under  -  I was still in a half daze), and got ready to leave. Security guy asks my name. I say \"Bob Wheeler. I work for Ken.\"\n\nDude knocks on the door and says \"Bob Wheeler. Kid who works for Ken.\"\n\nThe door opens and another armed guy lets me in. He takes my backpack and empties it on the reception desk. Says \"okay, take your stuff.\"\n\nI get back to Ken's suite and find out from his assistant that we're all getting free breakfast. It was massive and badass. Like everything you could ever want. Bacon, eggs, biscuits, juices, fruits. I mean a major spread. \n\nSo I ask her if it was bonus for some kind of great job and she shocks me to death.\n\nShe says \"no, and we're getting lunch too. We're locked in. We aren't leaving til the market closes and no clients are allowed in. There've been several death threats to basically everyone. When you leave you'll have an armed guard.\"\n\nI about shit my pants. It wasn't the same for a LONG TIME. The guys didn't go out for drinks together anymore, people didn't walk into each other's offices, nothing. For six weeks it was like working in a fucking cemetery.\n\nTo Ken's credit he had people buying with both hands and I'm sure everyone who listened ended up rich, but it was a goddamned bloodbath and lots of brokers never recovered.\n\nSo that's the story.

Retail investors now pay less\nwhen they buy and receive more when they sell stock because of the\nsubstantially reduced spreads- the difference between the best quoted\nprices to buy or sell. GAO's analysis of data from firms that analyze\ninstitutional investor trades indicated that trading costs for large\ninvestors have also declined, falling between 30 to 53 percent. Further,\n87 percent of the 23 institutional investor firms we contacted reported\nthat their trading costs had either declined or remained the same since\ndecimal pricing began. Although trading is less costly, the move to the\n1-cent tick has reduced market transparency. Fewer shares are now\ngenerally displayed as available for purchase or sale in U.S. markets.\nHowever, large investors have adapted by breaking up large orders into\nsmaller lots and increasing their use of electronic trading technologies\nand alternative trading venues.\n\nAlthough conditions in the securities industry overall have improved\nrecently, market intermediaries, particularly exchange specialists and\nNASDAQ market makers, have faced more challenging operating conditions\nsince 2001. From 2000 to 2004, the revenues of the broker-dealers acting\nas New York Stock Exchange specialists declined over 50 percent, revenues\nfor firms making markets on NASDAQ fell over 70 percent, and the number of\nfirms conducting such activities shrank from almost 500 to about 260.\nHowever, factors other than decimal pricing have also contributed to these\nconditions, including the sharp decline in overall stock prices since\n2000, increased electronic trading, and heightened competition from\ntrading venues.", "score": 7, "replies": []}, {"body": "Makes me almost feel like me losing all my money has an impact on something in the world", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "I believe they were yellow onions‚Ä¶ cause that was the style back then", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Exactly what I was going to say!", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "They'll go through the same at some point so it's good to know that those of us who've gone grey survived shitty markets and they will too.", "score": 623, "replies": [{"body": "You didn't tell us if you had cool broker suspenders or not.", "score": 107, "replies": [{"body": "Hahaha...
