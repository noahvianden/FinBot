The difference is that you accept the max profit/loss baked into the spread instead of managing the trade to those numbers. Using the $1 spread for $.75 debit example again, your max profit is $.25 and max loss is $.75. That implies a break-even ev win rate of 75%.

And on the other side, if it happens to tank (which I'm more worried about given the insanity of covid and the lack of an organized response from...well any authority), the break even point extends all the way to 0 (meaning theoretically there would be no loss even if it went to 0).

That is how you tell the broker the highest or lowest (depending if you are buying or selling) price you will accept for the order to be executed.  This is the ONLY way you should enter orders, IMHO.  So you set a limit order to open your position, then set a limit order to close your position.  The latter should be at your profit target.

For the sake of simplicity I will stick to single leg strategies because we aren’t ready to discuss spreads yet.\n\n1. Buy a put.  This is what you want if you think it’s going down quick and fast however you don’t want to sell your position.  This is called a “protective put” and it’s similar to term insurance.  You pay a premium for protection over a given amount of time.  At what point you want protection and the length of the contract will determine the premium you will pay.  Another factor in the premium is the “implied volatility“ which in simple terms is the market’s way of quantifying the odds of that price going there in that time.  For example, if earnings are coming up that could inflate the option price because earnings can move the market.  But buying the put gives you the right to sell your shares at your strike price but you can make money and keep your shares by simply selling to close your put (assuming it’s worth more than when you bought it).  The risk of the protective put is that the stock doesn’t go down enough quickly enough to pay for the premium you paid.  You have to be right on direction as well as time.\n2. Sell a call.  This is a covered call.  This works well if you think the price may go down some but not a lot, trade sideways or rise some but not a lot.  Here you are taking in premium and want your call to stay out of the money.  Time decay is now your friend as you want the contract to lose value so you can close it buy buying it back for less than you took in (or possibly let it expire worthless and keep the whole premium).  One risk here is that the stock tanks.  In this case your short call will do well but not enough to cover the drop in value of the shares.  Worst case is that your call expires worthless and you keep the premium but that premium won’t pay for the drop in the shares like the put could. The other risk is that the stock goes up way past your strike price.  In this case the value of the call goes up which, essentially, caps the gain you will get on the stock. In this case, your call is in the money and your shares could be called away from you at a price lower than the current market price.  As long as your strike price is higher than the average purchase price of your 100 shares, you will still make money but you lose the opportunity to make the full amount of the move.\n\nPersonally I like covered calls in most situations.  Your main risk is the opportunity cost of a big move up and you get a cushion if the price goes down.  Protective puts are good if your are correct and get an fast unexpected down move.  IMHO, that is a tougher game.\n\nThe important part of covered calls is to be ok with the shares being called away at your strike.\n\nAnyway, I know this is a lot.  I hope it helps.  But I would definitely look at other explanations on this to really understand this market.  If you have only traded stocks before, this is different and, IMHO, more complicated.

YOU decide when a call is exercised, nobody else does. The only exception is if you mistakenly hold an ITM call through expiration, then it is exercised by exception. As long as you never do that, your call won't be exercised unless you decide that it should be (which you should basically never do, as explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/pages/mondayschool/yourex)).\n\nBut that isn't the end of the story. You still have a problem if your short call was assigned. So first off, don't let your short call get assigned. You can do that by not holding it through expiration. That should sound familiar, since I just said that for the long leg call as well. But if by some series of unfortunate events your short leg should get assigned, you'll have to dispose of the short stock as soon as possible. A short call RECEIVES cash and DELIVERS shares. So it's not a problem of not having enough cash, unless the shares go up before you can cover the short.\n\nIt's a whole lot easier to close the short leg before it can get assigned. In the worst case scenario where you are really stuck with the short shares, you can sell to close the long LEAPS call to cover.

I think there is a misconception about how vertical spreads work lurking somewhere.\n\nLet's compare to an entirely OTM call debit spread. Only three things can happen over time: the stock goes up, stays the same, or goes down. If the stock goes up before expiration, you close the spread for a profit and open a new one at a higher strike (roll up and out). If it stays the same or goes down, you cut your losses and close the spread. That's optimal.

If I sell the Jan 20, 2023 at $95 strike, I could collect around $7.80 in premium.

For me, $11.24/trade would be a significant drag on my average per trade profit. And that's assuming you only have to pay that once. Do you have to pay all that again on the closing end of the trade as well? And do the fees scale to the size of the trade or are they constant? If they are constant, you have a possible way through all this, but more about that later.\n\nThe way to think about this is that on opening the trade, you are already in the hole by all the fees plus the spread. So you have to make up that deficit before you even start making a profit. This means that you have to assess trade opportunities with that deficit in mind. If your goal is to, for example, make an average of $100 per trade, you'd really need to make closer to $112 per trade to account for the fees. When you compare that to the capital at risk, that gives you an idea of what % gains you need to achieve. If they are greater than 10% (like if your capital at risk is $1000), it will be increasingly difficult to make consistent profits.\n\nAssuming the fees are constant, the way out of this mess is to trade big. The larger the amount of capital, the smaller the drag induced by fees in terms of gain %, since they are constant.\n\nAll right, with that gloom and doom out of the way, to your questions.\n\n> Would it make more sense to sell ITM, ATM, or OTM?\n\nStart from the assumption that you should **never** short calls ITM.

Backtesting of 30 delta OTM 45 DTE credit trades has shown the best balance of risk/reward.\n\n> My thought process is that with a longer expiry date, I could collect dividends in the meantime regardless of what happens with the stock. \n\nIf the dividends are that important to you, do not use a covered call. Likewise, if keeping the shares is a priority, do not use a covered call. A covered call is a contract that requires that you sell the shares. Even if that sale happens before an ex-div date or when you have a huge gain on the shares.\n\nNow all that said, the length of holding time for the call doesn't really matter wrt your access to dividends. You can manage the call by rolling it out as needed so that you have continuous ownership of shares on dates of record for the dividend. If fact, you can arrange to close the call the day before the ex-div date and then open a new call the day after the date of record, to be 100% certain you'll get the dividend. This will also avoid early assignment risk due to dividend payments. However, you won't always be able to close for a profit, so you'll have to decide if closing the call for a loss is worth the dividend.\n\nHere are in-depth explainers on covered calls that you should read:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/pages/positions#wiki_covered_calls\n\nScroll down to the Covered Calls section if the link doesn't take you directly there.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you and I very much appreciate the time you've taken to provide such a detailed response. \n\nMy trading costs are $9.99 per trade + $1.25 per option contract (yes it's atrocious).

That said, I have more shares in other accounts, and this account is a tester for me to try out different strategies. I get that if I wanted to bring in consistent additional income, 30 delta OTM and 45 DTE would be much better. However, this may be difficult for this trade in particular as premiums collected may be lower than trading costs. I will aim for 30 delta OTM and 45 DTE in my other account where I have 2600 shares of a dividend stock (trading fee would be $9.99 + ($1.25 x 26)). \n3. I figured that I could lock in today's price by selling a covered call at the expense of time. This works out to $780 - $22.48 - $557 (assuming price of $100.57, this is the difference between current price and the strike price of $95) = $200.52. This is essentially collecting roughly 2% to lock my capital for a year. If I kept the covered call all the way until expiry, I would be able to collect 4 dividend payments (again, I'm assuming that the call does not get exercised early). At $0.89 per share, this works out to $89 per quarter for a total of $356. \n   1. If the stock price goes up and is over $95 at expiry, I've essentially 'sold' my 100 shares already and collected around $556 for locking my capital for a year (5.56% gain). This could be less if for the last dividend quarter, the covered call is exercised in advance and I have to pay out that dividend?\n   2. If the stock price goes down or trades sideways, I could just keep the shares and close out the covered call for a small profit. \n4. I would not close out the call for a loss. \n\nI'm now reading about Dividend Risk in the link you provided (thank you!). Sorry to bother you, but I just want to make sure that I'm understanding it correctly:\n\n1. I likely will not face Dividend Risk until the call is closer to expiry. When the call is closer to expiry, there is a chance of Dividend Risk if the premium is worth less than the dividend. Hence your mention of rolling to a further expiry date. \n2. I own 100 shares of TD and can still collect dividends on those 100 shares even though I've sold a covered call on it. \n\nWriting all this out is helping me clarify my own thoughts. Please don't hesitate to correct me if I'm wrong on any of the above. Thanks again!", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "> Wouldn't rolling incur these costs as well as I'm essentially selling and re-buying?\n\nYes.

Exercising a long call early, even a deep ITM one, risks throwing away time value. So the way you described it will almost always lose money compared to just doing a call diagonal the way it is supposed to be done: long back leg is deep ITM, short front leg is about 30 delta OTM.

That’s known as a PMCC (Poor Man’s Covered Call) because if done properly it mimics a covered call without owning any stock.  \n\nMy concern is that you are going very short term.  The goal of the shorts is to make money on the declining extrinsic value.  To get that I’d rather sell a couple of weeks out and give those shorts time to decay.  The premium during expiration week isn’t great.  And the further you sell ITM the less of a % of the premium is extrinsic.  That’s great for your longs, not as great for your shorts.  You have to sell high to buy low.\n\nPersonally I don’t like going to expiration unless the odds of my shorts expiring worthless are really high.  The risk generally isn’t worth the reward near expiration.  The theta decay is good but the delta and gamma risk are usually bad.  Time is your friend with positive theta trades, don’t waste that friendship.  So once the extrinsic value of your shorts gets low, consider rolling them out and possibly go a different strike based on where the underlying is at that time.  That dan get you a high % of the value of the shorts and more credit in the trade which means more opportunity for profits.  Just never roll for a net debit.

Then when the exercised shares are delivered, they cover the short sale.\n\nDelivery usually requires T+2.

You can't compare Tesla's EV sales to ICE sales because at that point, you're negating the fact that Tesla spent over a decade of hard work that other automanufacturers refused to do. From 2004-2016, these automanufacturers didn't take EV seriously. Now, they're playing catch up. \n\n* Margins for EV's are higher.

Most expensive piece of equipment in an EV is the battery.\n* Tesla giga stamping is revolutionary for auto-engineering. Reduces costs significantly and results in an easier manufacturing process. Sandy Munro talks about this and how he and other auto engineers have been pushing for 1/2 piece chassis for some time but that the legacy automanufacturers were resistant to change.\n* Too much concern about P/E from amateurs. Just 18 months ago, their P/E was negative. 12 months ago, it was 1,200. They ended last year with a P/E ratio hovering around 330.

What I will ask of you is to please name me an EV maker that is profitable selling EV's because again, if you refuse to acknowledge that EV =/= ICE sales, you are lost in this entire discussion already. No amount of data I show you will ever convince you if you think the production of EV's are the same as ICE. \n* One simple fact of statement is when GM, Ford, Volkswagen, Volvo, and other car manufacturers tell you they plan on going fully EV by 2030-2040, it should tell you just how serious this EV transition is.

Plus, since Tesla manufacturers many of the parts themselves instead of outsourcing like the legacy manufacturers, they have a much better supply chain control.\n\nI didn't even mention their software advantages, supercharging network, or the fact that that Tesla (as well as GM) don't offer any federal tax credits in the USA but Tesla continues dominating the EV sales in the USA.

{"title": "Apple hits 3 trillion market cap, becoming the first company to hit the mark", "selftext": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-hits-3-trillion-market-cap-184825195.html\n\n“Apple (AAPL) officially has a market capitalization of $3 trillion. The tech giant passed the $182.86 mark Monday, making it the first publicly traded company in history to hit such a market valuation. Shares were bouncing above and below the number during the day.\n\nApple’s rise to a $3 trillion market cap, which is based on its stock price, comes less than two years after its market cap hit $2 trillion. Microsoft (MSFT) is also potentially on its way to the $3 trillion mark after topping $2 trillion in June.\n\nApple’s rise to $3 trillion comes on the back of the incredible success of its iPhone line, which has spawned accessories like the Apple Watch and AirPods, not to mention services like AppleCare, the App Store, Apple Music+, and Apple TV+.\n\nApple’s latest generation of hardware has, however, been struck by the same supply chain issues affecting everything from car manufacturers to home appliance makers. According to Bloomberg, the company previously cut its iPhone production goal by 10 million units in October due to supply constraints.\n\nAnd Nikkei Asia reports that Apple’s manufacturing partners in China were getting days off when they would normally be working full throttle to ramp up device availability for the holiday season.\n\nStay ahead of the market\nBut Apple has also shown off some major innovations in 2021 including the launch of its powerful M1 Pro and M1 Max chips for its MacBook Pro laptops. Those chips allow Apple to ditch Intel’s own processors, giving Apple far more control over design and performance.\n\nAnd then there are reports about Apple’s future devices including the obvious updates to stalwarts like the iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods, as well as entirely new product categories like augmented reality and virtual reality headsets.\n\nApple’s rise to $3 trillion hasn’t been without controversy, however. The company has repeatedly been called out for its cooperation with the Chinese government including its censorship policies and its need to store user data there. Apple, however, says it “complies with the laws pertaining to local entities that control customer data and provides data as legally required.”\n\nLike its Big Tech compatriots, Apple is also contending with antitrust issues. In August 2020, “Fortnite” maker Epic filed suit against Apple claiming it violates antitrust laws by requiring developers to use its in-app payment system, which automatically grants Apple a 30% fee for each purchase.\n\nWhile the company largely came out of suit unscathed, the judge in the case has called on Apple to allow third-party app developers to add external purchasing options to their apps. Apple is appealing the ruling.\n\nThe company is also reportedly staring down the prospect of an antitrust battle with the Department of Justice, which is said to be preparing its own case against the iPhone maker. That would likely focus on Apple’s control of the iPhone and its iOS operating system.”", "id": "rv92bv", "created_utc": 1641236280.0, "score": 4092, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 572, "comments": [{"body": "First trillion is the hardest", "score": 1247, "replies": [{"body": "Yep it took Apple 42 years to reach their first Trillion.

{"title": "Visa (V) vs PayPal (PYPL)", "selftext": "**Why is Visa (V) is a better stock to buy than PayPal (PYPL) right now**\n\n**(This is also my first stock analysis so please leave some tips on what I can do better)**\n\nI have recently many people comment on the recent sell of in PayPal and visa, PayPal being the more drastic dip. This recent dip makes people believe that PayPal is at a crazy discount right now and leads to a lot of retail investors btding. I believe with the information provided that visa is a much safer and better investment for consistent growth rather than PayPal.\n\nHowever, I believe that PayPal's recent sell-off was justified as the price did not meet the stock's performance and have been on a constant downtrend since the Pinterest debacle.\n\n**Note I do own 7 Visa shares and 1 PayPal share. (Previously owned more PayPal but have been switching it around recently)**\n\nMany people try to compare the usage of using Venmo compared to an older network of visa. However, when you look at Venmo as a p2p service for the younger community it controls about 57% market share filled with a lot of other fintech companies quickly growing rapidly. Like cash app gaining quickly on market share 180% increase in market share YOY. Now the same thing can be said about Visa, however, visa has the largest market share dominating the market.  I’m thinking of it as a too big to fail type of company because who does not have a visa?\n\nOverall, the p2p service space that PayPal dominates is a way smaller total market size if you compare the processing sector of visa.\n\n**Growth**\n\nVisa has a 5-year CAGR of around 15.4%, while PayPal has a CAGR of 19.3%\n\nPayPal has been trading around a pe of 45 with a median pe for the last 10 years at 51.01\n\nWhile visa has been trading 43 with a median pe ratio in the last 10 years at 32\n\nIndicating a similar growth between the 2 companies.\n\n**Dividend**\n\nPayPal has no dividends currently\n\nVISA currently offers a 0.38$ dividend which has been increased in December by 17.19% from the previous year. Visa has a long history of dividend payments back from 2008 to today. They have been increasing dividends by about 15% YoY for the past 3 years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Margins**\n\nVisa margins are very impressive and quite honestly a cash cow with net margins at 54%% roughly and have been hovering around that range for the past 10 years. Therefore, the recent news with amazon in the UK not accepting visa cards is irrelevant. They are very likely to sort some agreement for a cheaper transaction rate and Visa can afford to do that as they have incredible margins to do so. Visa credit cards also control about 80% of all credit cards in the UK likely causing a negative effect on both sides if this goes through.\n\nPayPal’s margins are sitting at a net of 17.58% which is also impressive but is substantially inferior to Visa’s.\n\n**Concerns**\n\nFor me, the main concern is the integration of defi projects around the crypto space like LUNA, AVAX which can affect greatly on companies like Visa and PayPal. However, I think we are still years away from that being a significant factor.\n\n**Overall,**\n\nThe growth rate for both companies has been great and somewhat similar, however with one company you get increased profit margins and dividends which are increased annually. PayPal’s management has also raised some serious concern after letting something like the Pinterest acquisition not to mention the insane amount of hate towards it from customers they literally have a sub for it lol.

A market share increase from 05% to 1.4% still incidates a 180% move, but would not be a statistically significant reason for anyone to change their perception.

I’m thinking of it as a too big to fail type of company because who does not have a visa?\n\nI mean no disrespect, but if this is your first analysis, your gut instinct carries no weight. You need to prove why Visa is a \"too big to fail\" company. Also \"too big to fail\" does not mean \"good investment\". The auto makers were \"too big to fail\" during the financial crisis of the late 2000s, so using that phrase is going to create an inherent distrust of your assessment from the vast majority of readers who were active in the market at that time.

PayPal isn't eating all of the market-share, but they're the biggest fish in a school that IS. ERa show their business model works and is growing and that can't be ignored, even if the pace is slowing down.\n\nIt hurts your case to tout the market-share increase of Cash App as a legitimate threat to PayPal's business and then completely dismiss the fact that PayPal (and their contemporaries) is doing the exact same thing to V. It's not happening as fast, but it is happening. (For the record, I also believe it will plateau at some point but, again, it's your job to find the evidence to prove that and present it to your audience).\n\n>**Growth**\n>\n>Visa has a 5-year CAGR of around 15.4%, while PayPal has a CAGR of 19.3%\n>\n>PayPal has been trading around a pe of 45 with a median pe for the last 10 years at 51.01\n>\n>While visa has been trading 43 with a median pe ratio in the last 10 years at 32\n>\n>Indicating a similar growth between the 2 companies.\n\nSmart move here, acknowledge a big reason why they're tied to each other, being willing to admit some justification for the toss up between the two is good for your credibility to the reader.\n\n>**Dividend**\n>\n>PayPal has no dividends currently\n>\n>VISA currently offers a 0.38$ dividend which has been increased in December by 17.19% from the previous year.

We're talking about doubling their entire production capacity along with significantly scaling up their sales, HR, legal, and everything that goes into supporting a business, EVERY YEAR, for many years into the future, and increasing market share, while other car companies continue to get stronger in EV/self-driving technology. I'm not saying it can't happen, but thinking detractors of the stock are simply missing the growth story or not considering the future trajectory is completely ridiculous.", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "And along that 3-5 year path every other major (and a shitload of newer, minor) car manufacturers is working overtime to bring EV vehicles to market as well, creating more competition for Tesla.\n\nThere is a lot more to consider than \"Man Tesla makes EVs, they are so awesome and growing fast\"\n\nFirst mover advantage doesn't always last forever.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "So I agree with almost everything in your post, I think we just diverge on whether we think Tesla will pull it off.\n\nI’m certainly not _sure_ that they’ll double sales for the next 3-4 years. And as you say, they’ll hit a ceiling somewhere.\n\nBut they’ve been doubling sales each year for a decade, the hardest parts (coming up with a credible product, building their own factories, owning their battery supply chain, developing autonomous hardware and software) are behind them.\n\nGlobal demand for EVs (and Tesla’s in particular) still far outweighs supply and is growing fast, all they need to do is copy and paste their gigafactories and continue to gather data to hone their Autopilot product. \n\nSo IMHO continued growth of roughly 100%pa is well within their reach, and frankly childsplay compared to what they’ve done already.\n\nYou’re absolutely correct when you point out all the challenges of scaling up heavy manufacturing. Software businesses like Facebook can double sales because they just need to add more capacity in data centres. For a car manufacturer, it’s infinitely harder as they need more land, raw materials, tooling, staff etc etc. \n\nBut you know what? The crazy mofos always seem to pull it off. Tesla shorts lost more than US airlines in 2020.\n\nSo I agree that there are huge challenges. I agree it seems unlikely given what other auto manufacturers can manage.
