Especially when considering that autos have traded at very low P/Es in general given the cyclical nature of the industry (something that is somewhat changed by subscription revenue models currently experimented with).\n\nEven a P/E of 20 is pretty high IMO but could be applied to a quality company with loyal customer base and some growth projects on the side.

At that point, macro economic factors begin to have a much larger impact on their sales and competition and supply excesses drive revenue per car down which suppresses margins.

Legacy auto built a nuts and bolts ICE vehicle that has an engine and a lot in common with a washing machine. Roughly the same level of software sophistication as well. Teslas (and other EVs from up and coming EV names) have no engine, and rely on very sophisticated batteries to power the other components. They are also increasingly sophisticated with their software. It might be more accurate to think of “cars” as giant iPads that you can drive. In this sense they command a PE more in line with other tech stocks.\n\nIt looks like the market largely agrees, since if you look at GM and F since they started going “all in on EVs” (at least in the media lol) their PE has absolutely soared. F has never traded this high in its history, and they just had a pretty objectively horrible year.", "score": -1, "replies": [{"body": "My Issue with the P/E as somebody that hasnt bought or sold Tesla yet is the implication of high P/Es. A P/E of 50 on a non growing company would mean a 2% yearly gain on earnings alone and since there is no growth there really is no reason for further stock movement upside. So the 2% is what you get. \n\nIf the S&P returns ~9% with lesser risk due to being diversified then one should at most pay a P/E of 11 for a non growth stock because otherwise the S&P would be a better investment even for an investor that does not fear risk (risk neutral investor).\n\nSo much for the non growth case. Usually the growth in DCF models in perpetuity is set to the standard inflation rate so roughly 2% which is negligible. \n\nNow the growth case: if you expect earnings to increase its obviously fair game to pay a P/E higher than 11 because you pay the present value of future earnings (many people forget to discount the earnings relative to time but we will do that later on). \n\nIf we dont care about time than a P/E of 55 (or lets say 50 and base P/E for no growth investment of 10 which is easy math) is fine for a company that fivefolds its earnings down the line.  It has to fivefold because of the no growth P/E aspect vs the S&P we discussed earlier. \n\nTo get back to the time problem. Obviously if you had the choice of paying 100$ for 10$ earnings now or 100$ for 2$ earnings now and 10$ starting in year 5 then you would choose the first. How about 90$ for the second option? \n\nUsually what I use to get the present value of future earnings is a discount rate of 9% (because the money could wait in the S&P for the investment to mature) if the investment is fairly priced in the end and the end price is already the current price there is no money to be made. So the current price needs to be atleast 9% (per year multiplicatively) better than your personal end price for the stock. \n\nTo get back to the valuation at hand:\n\n@OP which of the end variables of $12k per EV or the 12,1 mio EVs sold yearly do you expect to fivefold for the 50 P/E to be sensible. Obviously you can split the increase between the 2 (both x2,23 would work for example so 26,76k per car with 27 mio sold). \n\nA fivefold increase would not be enough though since you need to discount for time. If the earnings justifying the 50 P/E were to be achieved in 2032 (5 years after your final value) you would need to discount 2027 value by 1.09^5 = 1.54. So to justify the 50 P/E in 2027, 2032 earnings would need to be 7.7 times higher (again feel free to state the reason for the increase and split it between volume sold and margin per unit). \n\nTo not sound too bearish (which I am not, I do believe in the company, maybe not the stock though) I will give you another idea worth mentioning. If teslas earnings were to be safer than the S&P price increases (like coca colas earnings for example are) that would justify a „resting P/E“ above 10. If you give tesla a resting P/E of 20 you could decrease the earnings increases they would need by 50% (just change my calculations as you wish and depending on the resting P/E you see fit).

TSLA is just over 1%.  Assuming your 80mm unit number and market growth of 5% per year for the next 5-7 years (itself an aggressive assumption), you get to around 100mm sales per year globally. So your model is assuming TSLA moves from a smaller market share than BMW to holding a market share of ~12% (12mm sales in 100mm market), roughly 50% larger than either Toyota or VW.  They would be accomplishing this with their current offering, which does not include a true compact offering, a true low cost offering (Model 3 is still over $30K), or a true utility/truck offering (cyber truck and Model X’s are not going to be used as utility vehicles on European construction sites or Chinese farms).\n\nOn your margin assumptions, your model is not accounting for the increase in SG&A that will come with building out operations globally.  Not every market works like the US and in order to be viable around the world, TSLA will need to build out service operations, parts distribution, meaningful vehicle inventory, storage, and a sales force. I get that their model is currently different, but again, TSLA is still sub scale compared to the likes of VW and Toyota. \n\nYou will also likely see costs of inputs and component parts (such as lithium) begin to rise as more EVs are produced across the market, thereby partially offsetting the reduction in battery costs, but battery costs probably will continue to come down. \n\nHaving driven several EVs, TSLA is not the easy winner in the space from a quality perspective, even among the luxury segment.  As Ford, GM, Toyota, and VW begin to sell EVs, TSLA will have true direct competition.  While the billions of cash burn was a significant investment for TSLA, all of these companies could easily underwrite such an investment, especially since TSLA has proven the viability of the market.  If TSLA has true luxury EV competitors among Porsche, Mercedes, Audi, BMW, and Lexus, and true middle market competitors in Toyota and VW, I’d be incredibly impressed if they could continue to put up 20% annual revenue growth.\n\nSo, if they were able to do what you say, TSLA would absolutely garner an extreme multiple (50 -100x PE), but that is an incredibly unlikely outcome.

What percentage would this be of BEV sales? Say BEV sales are 50% of vehicle sales by 2027 (McKinsey projects 2030 so 2027 is incredibly bullish for Tesla).

Assume the car market grows at 2% a year, that’s what’s Tesla’s auto business would grow at. If you want a 10% return on investment annually (and who would be satisfied with 10% for such a cyclical industry?) for owning Tesla, you’d need an 8% earnings yield (10% total yield minus 2% growth yield). Which would imply a market valuation of 15 trillion. 15 trillion if they owned the entire global market, 100%. Your numbers imply they own 12% of the market. 100% is 8.3x 12%. Granted, a lucrative 12%, but not 8.3x more lucrative than the rest. \n\nYou can bring in Tesla’s other lines of business, sure, but we are specifically trying to value the autos line of business here. \n\nThe P/E in your auto industry case is a showstopping issue, for me. We can make up any numbers we want for the sales figures and net income, but that isn’t going to justify a 50 P/E under any reasonable discount rate assumption, in a DCF.

If Tesla produces 12M cars, they would be the biggest car company ever. In that case, the company would be ex-growth. So 50 P/E is unlikely. It would be more among the lines of VW and Toyota. So 10 PE. That would bring the price down significantly. \n\nThe second problem is your $12,000 gap earnings per EV. Assuming a 20% margin (which would be double of Toyota -  the most efficient car maker in the world). That would assume an average car price of $60,000. As VW average price per car is $30,000 and Toyota's is $27,000, that number is unlikely baring huge inflation (which would decrease the margins). You can't sell that many cars. $60,000 is just too a high of a price for most of the world to pay.  \n\nThe third problem is the 50% growth rate. Once you hit a certain number it is incredibly hard to scale up as many factories and production lines. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>2aii) Dropping battery costs is basically Wright's Law (Cathie was right about this). \n\nThat is wrong. Batteries efficiency does not increase as fast as the Wright's Law would suggest. If input costs rise (and they do, cobalt etc are getting more expensive), battery prices will increase. Also sinkinig battery costs will not benefit Tesla, but the consumer -  as companies will pass on savings to the consumer, if it allows them to take market share. \n\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>2aiii) \"Tesla isn't profitable!\" we heard for years. This is because they were burning cash for R&D. They've made their manufacturing incredibly efficient, and with 2 new factories we'll see even more benefits from Economies of Scale: \n\nThey are a car company. They don't benefit from the Economies of Scale in the same vein as other companies do. They are profitable at the moment. But look at the R&D costs of Tesla. VW alone is spending 10x yearly as Tesla. Sure Tesla is ahead, but it is difficult to beat a competitor who can spent 10x your money. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\r2bi) Competition. Tesla has always had competition. They had competition in 2013 to their Model S, and the have competition today. It's the ICE car, and Tesla is winning. A couple points to make here:\n\nThey had no competition until 2019. EVs were to unprofitable and unliked. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\r  \nMy next point is that the EV market is expanding.. rapidly. New EV models will not take sales from Tesla. They will take sales from the Toyota Corolla, RAV4, Camry, Honda Civic, Accord, Hyundai cars, Volkwagen cars, etc. BTW: we've already begun to see this :) whispers Tesla IS the chip shortage\n\nLook at the numbers from Europe. You will see that they do take sales from Tesla. EV market is expanding, but Volkswagen already sells more EVs in Europe then Tesla (even if Tesla has the best selling models). Tesla didn't have the chip shortage, because they produce much fewer cars. GM produced 4x times the cars in 2021 as Tesla did. Of course they are more affected by the chip shortage. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\r  \nI believe (assuming a bull market) that there will still be enough frenzy surrounding Tesla to see a 100 P/E in 2027. The conservative side of me calculates these numbers with 50. By the time the S-Curve flattens, the P/E could be 30.. or maybe 60 like Amazon? It's hard to say where Tesla will be in 2030, but I have a feeling they will be selling things we're not talking about today.\n\nI don't think so. Tesla has shown nothing that would suggest a dominance in solar (they don't even produce solar panels, they just install them) or energy. Being conservative would put that number at 10, as they would be ex-growth and would trade more in line with other car companies. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>  \n>  \n>I do know one thing though; Tesla should never be trading at Toyota, Ford, or GM's P/E ratios. The ICE car is a dead technology, not dropping in price like the EV, and is proving to be far inferior to EVs in every way. It just took Elon investing billions in a company that burned cash for a decade to bring down those battery costs. The world will see soon enough.\n\nThey will if they sell 12m cars. There is a upper bound for demand. \n\nPlease go into any other country other than Europe and the US. There is no chance in hell that  they have the infrastructure to support a lot of EVs. Hell even in Europe the infrastructure isn't there. Many people don't have houses were they can change their cars, and with how slow goverments operate atm, they wouldn't have built out the charging structure needed.\n\nElon did not bring down battery costs alone.

Paypal is a good company but there are a large number of payment processors process through visa to card partners like chase/JPM, CIBC, PNC and tons of of others. Visa, mastercard, amex, and a large number of other providers sell access to their gateways for application back end transaction processing. I also like banks that hold the credit cards for big box stores. CIBC for instance got the exclusive mastercard contract for all of Costco Canada.

My final move, however, was dumping most of my funds into Tesla.\n\nWhen I finally logged back into my account last January I couldn’t believe what I saw. My Tesla stock had multiplied by 5 due to the split, and gone up in value like 16X.

I learned that the best course of action is usually no action at all. \n\nDuring the huge drop last May, I put some funds together and doubled my position at $580. Instead of panic selling, I realized what a fantastic buying opportunity was presenting itself and turned it into a huge net positive. \n\nIt’s easy to read about what’s right to do while investing, but the only way to really learn is to experience things for yourself.

They had a reputation for being honest in their reviews, or some would say \"overly critical\". For example, they had a 10 Worst Cars of the Year award.\n\nTheir first really popular series was the \"GM death watch\" where they chronicled all the problems with GM and talked about how they were going to go bankrupt as soon as there was any serious problem (a recession, gas prices going up, people buying less SUVs, etc). And it turns out they were spot on about that.\n\nIt feels like they didn't really now how to be positive, so they just came out with more and more \"this company is doing to die\" posts. This guy, Niedermyer ended up writing a lot about Tesla, and of course it was consistently negative. Back then Tesla was a little startup trying to survive, and he basically wrote about how Musk was ruining the company and everything they did was wrong.\n\nThe blog never really became mainstream enough to do well, they were acquired, Fargo left, Niedermeyer took over and they made a series of terrible editorial choices that saw a bunch of the good writers leave. Since then the only content Niedermeyer has ever made that gets any attention at all is being negative about Tesla and Musk in general. It seems like he's embraced a lot of the weird \"TSLAQ\" conspiracy theories over the years. But he's basically been saying that Tesla is a fraud and that they will/should go bankrupt soon for the last decade or two.\n\nFor someone who's covered Tesla pretty much since the beginning, it's notable that he's completely missed the chance to predict any of the successes they've ever had.

Shareholders don't earn $ in the same way as you or I might earn money from working a job or running a business.

My account balances increased mostly because of income that I earned from jobs, not market gains.\n\nInvestors have had an easier time growing wealth over the past decade, because the technological groundwork of the early 2000's made enormous business success of FAANGs + Microsoft and other companies like CRM possible.

It's really just four things lacking that are standing out.\n\nFirst, I'm confident they're improving, is the unnecessary braking on highway (hoping V11 resolves it). Any kind of trailer next to the car has high chance to cause a braking scenario. Additionally, people changing lanes next to the car still has a high probability of the braking especially if they are changing quick or get close to the line. Never once has the braking been justified for me.\n\nSecond, changing the speed. It's incredibly jarring to me to have my speed randomly drop for no reason on the highway (usually to 65, in a couple spots much lower). It's consistent locations. But also forcibly slowing vehicle by dropping 5 mph increments taking exits off freeway (kind of a segue into it should only consider max speed as a max speed and only go as fast as is safe, such as taking sharp country turns, etc).\n\nThird is lane changing into faster lane... and not going faster. They neutered acceleration long ago. So, my car's set to 75 mph. Car in front of me is 73 mph (slowed from 75+ temporarily for a turn or just being inconsistent), so change into a 90 mph lane. Get fucked. I'd really like to see a preferred speed / maximum speed. Default to preferred speed and burst to max / maintain max speed as appropriate. Don't bother changing lanes if traffic flow in the target lane is faster than max (or hard capped) speed. Feels complicated, even just a toggle am I ok speeding faster than set speed. \n\nFourth is my biggest FSD beta gripe. Stopped at a light, light turns green, people go and car just waits like a fucking asshole. Fucking go. Don't gotta match speed of car in front exactly. But it's not difficult to predict a premature slowing / stopping situation going through intersections. This one kills me. 🥴\n\nThey fix these things I'm gonna be so happy. They don't, and it'll be like my drive to/from LA today: I don't use it 😭\n\nBonus is multiple turn lanes into roads with many lanes. Car makes decision it must take inner most turn lane, when outer turn lane is most optimal to directly turn into the corresponding far lane skipping the intermediate lanes. \n\nExtra bonus: long ass display prompt to change lanes to follow route. Just fkn change lanes, it's inevitable to follow route. Don't wait five minutes for someone to finally come along just to cut them off 🤣\n\nFirst world problems.

It's just a little thing that irks me, because most people in my area don't lag quite like this because lights are paaaaiiiinnnnfuuuulllllyyy long and aren't green long enough.

If we say then that first year should be a ramp of about 30% of end output in the first year, i.e. 225k. If we assume a ramp of maybe 10k 30k 70k 115k, you can see how if Wall Street has a ramp of 5/15/30/60, you get 40k units differential in Q3. That differential might also apply to Berlin, but the daily deliveries data might erode that alpha. All in all, Q3 could beat by like 40-80k vs Wall Street, and our confidence of the projections would be high because of the frequency of Texas/Berlin data. Fremont and Shanghai also likely beat expectations generally. So maybe its possible a 100k unit beat in Q3. Really just choose how short term you want to go, and how otm.

{"title": "White Gold Rush: Lithium America’s Corp (LAC)", "selftext": "Currently those commies in China control 80% of the worlds Lithium supply. Well, Uncle Sam wants to take this back and there is one business with the American flag at their back which will be doing this $LAC. \n\nLAC have exclusive mining rights to Nevada Thacker’s Pass, the second largest Lithium reserve in the world &amp; the largest in North America. \n\nAs a base start for your intro to LAC there is a great interview recently with the CEO Jonathan Edwards here: The market for lithium: A metal miner with an out of this world valuation (https://www.cnbc.com/video/2022/01/06/the-market-for-lithium-a-metal-miner-with-an-out-of-this-world-valuation.html) don’t let the alarmist headline throw you, the CEO handles the value question straight out of the gate. \n\nOkay, so you haven’t watched the video and instead just googled LAC seen it’s up a bunch and think, meh this isn’t for me, well, let’s look at the catalysts that are coming up: \n\nCatalysts:\n\nThacker Pass approval, the judge just denied the appeal to stop construction. Ground is being broken people! Whilst this isn’t the final judgement, it is a great step in the right direction; two of the attorney’s for those trying to stop the mine just quit. Final judgement is in March and I expect the price to keep climbing ahead of the inevitable approval. \n\nUSA USA USA! It has political desire to take back lithium production from the measly 1% it currently gets itself and is subsiding hugely lithium production at home - see BBB, or whatever they replace it with &amp; other legislation. The USA won’t allow a major ingredient in industry to be at the hands of the CCP and potential tariffs. LAC is going to be the key USA based supplier of this &amp; all other based innovations/products that come from lithium. This will be reflected in legislation, if they can every agree to write and vote on any. \n\nLithium prices are rising exponentially - Google Lithium prices - and are much needed in the clean tech revolution; EV, battery etc. \n\nLAC has just received multiple price upgrades and has a 80-90% buy rating by analysts. \n\nRecently approved acquisition to a further mine, taking total to 3. \n\nPotential partners including Ford, GM and TSLA - the CEO JE states, we are in numerous talks with people regarding potential partners and are under NDA. TSLA ain’t far away from this mine… just saying. \n\nElsewhere: \n\nLook, we all have picked a sports, I mean Car team, whether you are Ford or TSLA or GM or Lucid or are a GME ape who thinks they will make EV cars soon as well, every man and his dog is scrambling to build as many EV’s as possible, ice cars will be out of production by 2030. They will all require huge lithium to get through the EV arms race. In a world at war, the arms dealers get rich. \n\nThere is a less visible battery race going on this needs lots of lithium. \n\nJust signed off on another mine taking their total to 3. \n\nJonathan Evan’s is a rockstar CEO. \n\nYour complaints: \n\nAnother business with no revenue!? Yes, but by the time they are making loads of revenue the share price will be a lot higher. Speculate to accumulate my regarded brothers. \n\nThose tribes &amp; eco warriors are against it; well yes and no, a lot of the tribes peeps are for the mine due to the prosperity &amp; jobs it will bring. In terms of climate, the impact study shows this will be a huge net positive in the fight against climate change. Biden has committed to fighting climate change at COP26. It hot outside and we got to stop it. \n\nInflation! Rate rises! This can be offset by the rise in demand and price of lithium + the subsidies by the USA gov for lithium production. LAC also has an excellent balance sheet to weather this. \n\nMy position: \n\nI am in for $30K with an avg 3x leverage at $29 per share. \nI plan to run up this up to it hitting $45 and take profit. Then reinvest everything in straight shares. I’m in Australia, so I don’t have the fun of options. I can only just leverage myself to the tits. I am sure people can come up with far more regarded plays that will make bank! Also, I’m in Australia, we make a lot of money from digging shit out of the ground. \n\nTL;DR: LAC is going to make lithium, lithium make EV go brrrrr. USA need to take lithium away from China. LAC make USA go purrr. Lithium is white gold. \n\n(Wrote this on the mobile because couldn’t be bothered to open the laptop.)\n\nNot financial advice. I have been wrong often in the past. Do your own googling.\n\nEdit: just to be clear, the main point here is that the USA needs to get Lithium out of the ground in its own back yard. The USA is not trying to make money from LAC directly (which is a Canadian based company) rather it needs LAC to supply all it’s own industry’s with Lithium. LAC’s origins isn’t important, but if it was Canada and China hate each other; see the whole Huawei thing. Canada and USA are staunch brothers obvs. LAC giveth the USA lithium.\n\nEdit 2: clarifying American lithium backing: \n\nAs responded in thread source SA: \n\n“The Government Wants Lithium\n\nLooking past the trendy word crafting, we can see the Biden administration is behind lithium much like the Trump administration was. Looking at the December 13th, 2021 statement we see the following highlights:\n\n1. \"The Department of Energy (DOE) and Department of Transportation (DOT) will establish a Joint Office of Energy and Transportation focused on deploying EV infrastructure.\"\n\n2. $5 billion in funding for a national charging network.\n\n3. $2.5 billion in additional charger funding.\n\n4. Target of 50% EV penetration by 2030.\n\n5. DOT will publish standards for EV chargers.\n\n6. \"Increase domestic manufacturing of EV batteries and components and advance environmentally responsible domestic sourcing and recycling of critical minerals.\"\n\n7. \"$17 billion in loan authority in the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program (ATVM) to support the domestic battery supply chain. LPO will leverage full statutory authority to finance key strategic areas of development and fill deficits in the domestic supply chain capacity. This will include the ATVM program making loans to manufacturers of advanced technology vehicle battery cells and packs for re-equipping, expanding or establishing such manufacturing facilities in the United States.\"\n\n8. \"Leverage $13 million in FEMP's Assisting Federal Facilities with Energy Conservation Technologies grants to unlock an estimated $260 million or more in project investments, including battery storage projects.\"\n\n9. \"Funded two dozen teams to expand sourcing of lithium from geothermal brines and approved a permit for the Nevada-based Thacker Pass lithium mine.\"\n\n10. \"Automakers are also signing contracts that leverage domestic supply, including Ford sourcing lithium from recycled content through Redwood Materials, GM sourcing lithium from geothermal brines in the Salton Sea with Controlled Thermal Resources, and Tesla sourcing lithium from a Piedmont project in North Carolina.\"\n\n11. \"$7 billion in funding to accelerate innovations and facilities across the battery supply chain from battery materials refining, processing and manufacturing to battery manufacturing, including components, to battery recycling and reuse. These investments will support the development of a North American battery supply chain, help expand manufacturing and recycling facilities in the United States and substantially advance the battery recycling through research, development and demonstration projects in collaboration with retailers as well as state and local governments.\"\n\nEdit 3: TSLA link \n\nSee interview Q at 2.30 with CEO: https://www.cnbc.com/video/2022/01/06/the-market-for-lithium-a-metal-miner-with-an-out-of-this-world-valuation.html\n\nEdit 4: additional information \n\n\nUser lenraleigh left the following comment in the thread below which adds more depth to the DD; big thanks to them for highlighting these additional bits! \n\nComment: \n\nImportant points:\n\n•\t⁠Caucharí will be producing in mid 2022.\n•\t⁠LAC just purchased Millennial.\n•\t⁠LAC has been investing in Arena Minerals. Millennial's lithium brine project, Pastos Grandes is immediately adjacent to Arena's Sal de la Puna project. Arena is an exploration company and it makes sense that LAC will want to buy that as well.\n•\t⁠LAC has something like $400m cash on hand. This gives them a tremendous amount of leverage when selecting a partner for Thacker Pass.\n•\t⁠So you see, LAC is not just Thacker Pass. They aspire to be a \"major\" Lithium producer and have been making very strategic moves. They have Thacker Pass. They have Caucharí. They have Pastos Grandes. They will likely have Sal de la Puna. The quality and quantity of Lithium they will likely be producing in a few years is amazing.\n•\t⁠Problems in Chile and other countries are going to lead to more good new for LAC and other producers in the USA and Argentina.\n\nFull disclosure: I am a long term LAC holder and began accumulating in Feb 2017. LAC has changed my life. I personally scaled out a bit at $18 and will trim a bit around $50 (or whenever it overtakes too much of my portfolio.) IMO we'll see $100+ one day, and I'll still be holding. It's probably not a good stock to \"get rich quick\" on, although, many people do believe it will run up into the 40's over the next several weeks.\n\nFWIW I got lucky and found Joe Lowry's \"Global Lithium\" podcast back in the day. It's the one podcast I listen to and it is gold. LAC's geologist has been on there, and so has the CEO.\n\nEdit 5: \n\nTL;DR (revised courtesy of Professional_Call_41) \n\nLAC is going to $100 this year. With Judge Du Approval in March + DFS + strategic partner + retail/institutional FOMO all in lockstep and in the coming months… mix in production at CO by year end and it’s a no brainer… this all WITHOUT considering the structurally short Lithium supply/demand issues that are here to stay and worsening by the day.\n\nIf there’s one companies stock with the right story, management team, deposit, and time in history all lining up for a massive surge, it’s this one.\n\nViva LAC", "id": "s49vvh", "created_utc": 1642214879.0, "score": 72, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 113, "comments": [{"body": "Congrats on being an LAC investor.

What you can see on the 4 day chart is a range between the 510.67 pivot and the 526.76 pivot. Those pivots provide the low and high side of the channel. \n\nOn the daily, you can see that massive dip from 610 to 510, and yet the CMF (money flow) shows that someone has slowly been buying that dip. Additionally, the previous days open was around $535, that provides a nice target of where the stock could go back to. Thursday the stock dropped, then Friday it consolidated into the pop. \n\nNice trade u/dense-balance-6041 ballsy with the 0DTE, but you read it right!", "score": -1, "replies": [{"body": "Completely retarded comment.

There are also other ARM loan terms 7/1 and 10/1 are the most common but there are also 7/6 and 10/6 arms where the initial interest is locked in for 7 or 10 years and then there's an adjustment every 6 years thereafter.\n\nARMs were popular pre-2010 because they offered a lower initial interest rate and interest rates in the US had generally been trending downward for years from their 17.82% rate highs back in November of 1981. You could get the benefit of the lower interest without the cost of refinancing and changing/extended your loan term.\n\nThey became particularly popular in the late-90's and early 2000's as a new generation of home buyers, ones who didn't directly experience the 70's stagflation or the 80's Savings and Loan crisis, entered the market. The 90's were a boom period and the 2000's seemed set to continue that trend and ARM loans were less regulated so people were qualifying for them with no money down on the house and without income verification believing they would have the money in a few years.  Add to that practices like making \"interest only\" ARMs where the first couple years you pay only the interest on the loan and then having a balloon payment due for the principal that wasn't paid during those years when the mortgage rate adjusts and it was a recipe for disaster\n\nMany people didn't plan financially for the possibility that their rate would go up or for that balloon payment or did plan for it but saw their savings wiped out in the 2008 crash.\n\nToday ARMs are more regulated and there are limits on how much your payment can change as the result of an interest rate adjustment but remain unpopular because of the connotation they gained in 2008 and because fixed rate options seemed the better deal as interest rates started dropping below 5% in 2010, especially as the spread between the discount rate on the ARM and the full rate on the fixed loan shrank (e.g. at a couple points in 2021 ARMs and fixed rate loans were being offered at nearly the same rate).\n\nThe theory has been that at some point interest rates will HAVE to go back up, which is looking true for 2022 after interest rates bottomed out at 2.74% in 2021 (they're already up from that low), so might as well lock in the low rate as opposed to chance it will go up significantly in the next 7 or 10 years.\n\nARMs still have value though in the current market place. Maybe not as a play on continually declining interest rates but as a hedge on how long you think you'll stay put for. Depending on which source you use, the average length of home ownership is around 16 years but the median length is in the 10-14 year range... If you think its likely you'll move within the next 10 years they may be of benefit.\n\nWith interest rates expected to start climbing, they may also find value again both in the discount rate and if you dont think rates will continue to climb and will level out or return back to previous lows in X years...

Except 15-year mortgages have lower rates than 30-year mortgages.\n\nInterest rate isn't super important because of how the early payoff goes. To pay off a 3.5% 30 in 15 years costs only a ***tiny*** bit more than paying for it through a 15 year loan. The delta between the rates on a 30 and a 15 year fixed is so small that it just isn't a huge impact.\n\nLets work with a 300,000 house, with a loan amount of 240,000 (20% equity conventional loan, no PMI)\n\nFor interest rates lets use 3.5% on the 30, and 3.0 on the 15, because that's about what a refinance would have right now depending on qualifications. \n\nBased on those numbers, the base payment rate on each loan\n\n\n* 30 3.5% year fixed: $1,077.71 (Not including any escrow amounts like taxes, insurance, etc.) Total cost: $387,974.61\n* 15 3.0% year fixed: $1,657.40 (Not including any escrow amounts like taxes, insurance, etc.) Total cost: $298,331.27\n\nNow paying off the 30 in 15\n\n* 30 year 3.5% fixed, payoff in 15 years: $1,715.72 (Not including any escrow amounts like taxes, insurance, etc.) Total cost: $308,829.60\n\nSo you pay about $10,000 over the 15 years, but you gain the ability, at ANY TIME to stop paying 1715, and step down to 1,077. That means you can reduce your payment by almost 40% without going through a refi. If you are in a 15 year mortgage, and need to step down your payment because you got laid off and want to stretch your finances out, well guess what, you don't have a job so you can't refi, chump.\n\nMaintaining that flexibility is *hugely* worthwhile. Most good mortgage brokers will walk you through this. That sort of planning is hugely beneficial to a lot of people.\n\n\n>30-year mortgage makes more sense if you invest the difference in payments.\n\n\n30 year fixed makes sense for even *more* reasons. It allows you to have a lot more actual buying power because of the lower payments, and taking advantage of the gains in a real asset makes sense there. If you qualify for a loan, you qualify for a ***payment*** not a total amount. If you can pay 1500 a month including taxes and insurance; (assuming 60k for down payment money in BOTH scenarios)\n\n* On a 30 year, 3.5% fixed you can afford a roughly $320,000 home. \n* On a 15 year, 3.0% fixed you can afford a roughly $240,000 home.\n\nI even adjusted the insurance on these based on rough rebuild costs in my market. Here in the Twin Cities, the difference this jump makes is pretty huge.\n\nThat's a HUGE difference in buying power and what you are looking at in a home. It's also a HUGE difference in how much you can realize off the general steady gain in real estate prices. It's a smart investment to ***always*** go for the 30 year with rates like this.

If you have an adjustable-rate mortgage that's about to reset to a higher rate, you aren't necessarily locked into it for the long term. This article shows you what you can do to get yourself out of this predicament.\r  \nThe first, and most obvious option for those with low-rate ARMs that are about to reset is to refinance into a 30-year fixed rate loan. This will give you reasonable monthly payments that will last much longer than your previous loan.\r  \nThe general rule of thumb is that Adjustable Rate Mortgage loans (ARMs) make the most sense when interest rates are low. While no one can predict exactly when rates will go up higher in the future, many homeowners are currently taking advantage of today’s low rates to refinance from their adjustable-rate mortgage to a new fixed-rate mortgage. If you’re among those who are considering this move, here are some points to be aware of.\r  \nThe main benefit is stability. While an adjustable-rate loan’s monthly payments can fluctuate, the monthly payment of principal and interest on a fixed-rate loan will stay the same throughout the life of the loan. This can make it easier to set your monthly budget and can also provide peace of mind. With a fixed-rate loan, your principal and interest payments won’t go up even if market interest rates increase.\r  \nFixed-rate loans tend to have higher interest rates than adjustable-rate loans, especially compared to the first years of an ARM. However, when interest rates begin to rise things can change quickly and dramatically.\r  \nIf you choose to refinance to a fixed-rate loan, you may also have the opportunity to make additional changes to your loan at the same time. Depending on your circumstances, you may also be able to lower your monthly payments.

Its not an issue of assets vs liabilities or net worth. Being house poor is an issue of minimum living expenses vs net income and more than that how much of your minimum living expenses that are paid out of net income are going towards your housing. House poor is also sometimes referred to as house rich and cash poor and describes a condition of cash flow in which you are living at or beyond your means and have very little flexibility in your budget for discretionary spending because your housing takes the majority of your take-home/net earnings per month. If you want to tap investment assets to augment your income and provide for that discretionary spending, by all means feel free to do so but that's not really getting you out of the state of being house poor unless you plan for to tap those funds indefinitely as you would in retirement.\n\nNote that in the US, aside from having good credit, the major factor in qualifying for a mortgage involves looking at your Debt-to-Income Ratio. That is you take all of your monthly debt payments/obligations including mortgage and divide them by your monthly gross income. They want to see a DTI of .35 (35%) or less to be considered \"low risk\" but if you have great credit, they'll accept up to 40%. Taxes generally take up another 25% for most buyers leaving you with another 35-40% to meet all other living expenses, including savings (retirement, vacation, emergency, etc).\n\nHow then does one become house poor you might ask? Usually its because they bought as much house as they could afford rather than what they could comfortably afford and/or skimped on the down payment. Maybe before the mortgage they had a DTI of only 1% so the house, which adds 39% to their DTI, makes up nearly 50% of their net take home pay right away. Then add in 5-\\`10% in home maintenance expenses (lawn care, cleaning, fixing things that break, etc) and suddenly your house is costing you 60% of your take home pay without any other expenditure and you're house poor.\n\nNow of course there's an argument to be had that you can afford to be house poor for a period when you are starting out... Especially if you're house poor calculation is based off of a single income and your spouse is going to start contributing significantly more. The caution one must take is what happens when the \"plan\" doesn't work out. A shooting star career may level out. The economy may crash and one or both of you may be out of work. Or maybe your wife becomes a lawyer but you decide to have kids and she decides to take a year off during which your stuck back on 1 income that may or may not have advanced as expected. Banking on those increases can set you up to be in a bad position. Especially if interest rates start climbing and your loan is adjusting payments faster than your income can keep up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGiven the info you've provided, it would appear you have about 360k on the mortgage and assuming you dont have any bankruptcies or other red flags on your credit, I'll assume your present day income (not future income) and debts keeps your DTI below 35%....\n\nAt that point you would be a well qualified buyer and the question becomes what's the spread on the interest? In the US, the lowest ARM I've seen has been around 2.25% at a time when a 30 year fixed mortgage was going for 2.75%. You indicated your current initial interest rate is 1.3% which would seem to imply another market other than the US, given your handle, I assume Canada and I cant speak to the rates in Canada but if you had locked into the 2.75% loan here in the US, the total interest on the fixed loan of 360k would be around $170k over 30 years.\n\nOn the ARM however, lets assume rates rebound and start going up by 0.25% every year for 3 years after the initial 7 years lock-in expires. At 10 years you decide your done with the rate increases, interest rates only look to be going higher and so you refinance into a 20-year fixed loan at 3%. At the end of the 30 years, you'll have paid $164k in interest plus the refinance cost of about $3k saving a total of $3k but even if you refinanced for nothing, is saving $6k over 30 years or $200/year or roughly 1% of the total loan payments worth it?\n\nLets pretend for a second that you dont lock-in at 10 years and you let it ride and push it out to 15 years. In 15 years your interest rate is now 4.25% and you're now tapping out and looking to refinance into a 15 year fixed 3% loan rather than see your rate level out or continue to climb. At the 15 year mark you've already paid $120k in interest and you still have 15 years more to go over which you'll pay another 53k. In this scenario you're already at a $3k loss compared to fixed rate loan from the start and that's without considering the refinance cost at year 15. Even if you could some how keep the initial discounted interest rate on the ARM of 2.25% for 30 years, you'd end up spending $135k in interest. Is saving $1000/yr over 30 years really worth it? Also consider that even at the 2.75% fixed rate, you are still beating \"normal\" inflation levels of around 3% let alone the 6.8% rate of 2021.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI note that you indicated they let you repay $65k/yr early without penalty which also means you're more or less locked in to the loan until that clause expires. Note that with most fixed loans, there is no early payment limits or penalties so you can repay far more than that at any time which shortens and saves you interest over the entirety of the loan plus gives you flexibility to sell at any time.\n\nAlso note that my \"expect to be in the home for more than the initial lock-in\" would better be phrased as \"expect to still be in and need the mortgage past the initial lock-in.\" If you only want to keep the home/loan for 7 years than take advantage of the lower rates and go for it.\n\nLastly, all of this is based on the most recent 2021 market conditions in which mortgage loans in the US tested new lows in the 2% range that had not been seen before. Under these conditions, it would be highly unlikely for the mortgage rates to further slip lower to a meaningful degree and far more likely for them to go back up... And by meaningful, I generally mean around a full percentage point difference in rate. While a 0.25% or 0.5% difference does make a difference in the overall cost of the loan and monthly payment, waiting for such a small change on the basis of the savings is often an irrational decision based on the fear of loss and missing out on lower rates. Its also generally considered not to be worthwhile to refinance a fixed rate mortgage until the new interest rate is at least 1% lower than your current rate, this is a big part of why ARMs were so popular in the 90's and 00's when interest rates were still in the 6-9% range and falling. You didn't have to refinance to get the lower rate, just wait until the arm readjusted and as long as the rates continued downward, every year, it'd readjust lower again without having to pay to refinance. As rates start going the other way though, it may be beneficial to lock in now.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "What about the market pricing in low rates?

Your loan officer can then scale the par rate to give you a lower rate which are the points at additional cost or a higher rate which are called credits for reduced closing costs. 1 point is 1% of the loan balance so $2000 will get you 1 point (read on the rate sheet as 99) or you could receive $2000 for 1 credit (read on the rate sheet as 101). It’s not always perfect but let’s say 1 point in either direction equates to .25%. So for $2000 you will get a 2.75% rate or you could take a 3.25% and have most of your closing costs covered with the $2000 credit depending on fees (biggest variables being state taxes, I’m talking about you Florida, title insurance for large lots, and the lenders fees) Generally speaking, you’ll want to calculate your time to recoup and the overall return on the investment. Simple way is to take your monthly savings and divide it by the closing costs. That’s how many months it’ll take for you to break even. I use a more precise but complicated method that I won’t get in to and never pitch to clients for tactical reasons (don’t want to open an overly complicated can of worms and get a million questions) Back to buying the points, with a lower rate you will pay less interest over time, less per month, but pay equity upfront (either cash or adding the cost to the loan which most people do) so with higher closing costs your time to break even becomes longer. The opposite is true for receiving credits, consider a scenario where you quality for a lower rate after utilizing enough credits to refinance for free. I’ve had situations where the borrower gets paid to take a lower interest rate since they were uncertain how long they were going to keep the property and as a result the mortgage.

{"title": "Unpopular opinion : No crash in the near term", "selftext": "You are only going to be getting missed opportunities  waiting for your hypothetical dooms day. Yet again... \n\nDisclaimer:  I am but a retard, you will find plenty of spelling mistakes. This should tell you that I am to dumb to be a financial advisor, this is certainly not.\n\n Edit: I suggest you to read the low key newer comments after the edit.  I also encourage you to comment.\n\nAs one of the retards who commented bellow says : \n“More money has been lost waiting for a crash then lost in any crash” \nAbraham Lincoln\n\n\n *often in the market for every reaction there is an over reaction*\n\nThe world feels uncertain? Perhaps the only difference between the reality of tragedy in life today compared to  20 years ago is how fast news travels.  the power of media outside of conventional new of the last 50 years has been drastic. These sources range from podcast to social media, and soon a mataverse. The world has always been in a constant state of conflicts from international to domestic affairs. Not all events lead to crashes, some may even give rise to HUGE  opportunities.  The only significant difference this time is the tragedy of COVID and its aftermath. Whos to say the aftermath is negative for the market specifically.  In fact  i see technological advances from the mistakes learned in this b.s we all got caught on in, thus paving the way for more market opportunities. \n\nHike increase was known ; Hike increases will be less impactful then previously thought . Theres a difference between the reaction  of the number itself  and the actual impact of that number. The number was slightly higher then estimated followed by an overaction. Once they realize the impact isn't as bad because feds will continue to print and people will continue to afford, theyll soon talk about how stable the rates are. \n\nMidterms: every midterm election is a moment of great uncertainty, markets use that as an excuse. Yet every president needs  his last  two years  after midterms to have better economic poll numbers. And if they don't the market will rally behind the next president. They will try everything they can to pass spending bills, first its a fat one, once it doesn't get through, like a brisket they trim it down to the perfect fat amount to tickle both parties. Once a new president is elected the idea of a great economic run based on b.s promises runs the market again...it also depends who actually keeps their promise.\n\n\nOmicron and other variants  :  People are catching  on. The reaction will be less impactful overtime. COVID allthough real and unfortunate,  like many other previous pandemics  will soon be ineffective for the short side. In fact  pharma tech stocks  will benefit from talking about new progress made in preventing future pandemics, technology etc. \n\n\nSupply chain : it has been ALLOT  better in terms of ports. The hard part has certainly been fixing the labour demand. Without much immigration it becomes hard. These days it pays to stay home plus the mental stress of covid has caused an even deeper desire to stay home. As long as it pays to stay home  markets will be fine, because companies will keep making money from cash been poured to  stay at home dads. The hike increasing pushes people to get back to work and stop sitting on their ass, as social welfare won't cut it.  Hike increases also increases inflation then causes assets value to go up.\n\nTech will rocket ,5g, BIG DATA,  metaverse, the next 50 years we will be literally living on Mars. \n\nAs for AMC and GME ;  we know some have a negative reaction to those two ticker symbols. Perhaps because they have had *missed opportunities* no pun intended or perhaps they wanna move on. The though is the following; You and I most likely learned about WSB because of first GME and then AMC. They  are also the ones with the most evident volume and catch on with main steam media.\n\nGME/AMC will rocket again as they are too lucrative for media to stop talking about.

What happened in the past was that you'd have a crash and then a slow recovery, typically followed by sideways action.\n\n Covid is obviously not like the other situations but it really does seem like the rich have learnt how to have their cake and eat it even quicker this time. Yeah big crash, loads of chumps lost money but two months later the big boys were richer than ever before.\n\n They (central banks/politicians/megacorps/trillionaires) kept interest rates as close to zero (or even below in some countries) to encourage nonsense spending and no saving and that seemed to be a long term policy until covid, after all how else do you get exponential growth without massive debt accrual? You can't keep making humans because over population is fucking catastrophically awful. So the plan was to increase debt bigly to make stonk (and real estate) go up bigly but then you've got a pretty big problem because everyone's spending way beyond their means, personal and government debt is so insanely removed from actual earnings/gdp and wages have been de facto frozen (reduced) for the working class for fifteen years so what you need, like really really need, is inflation to reduce the value of that debt and then....covid happened and then there was a flash crash and then there was a crazy bull market and then inflation over 5% every month for a year. If I was rich I couldn't think of a more perfect scenario. I don't give a fuck about inflation because I bought the crash pre-inflation, that's locked in, those profits are untouchable now and inflation let's stonks go up and allows debt to be maintained (just don't go adding to it right governments...right?) annnnd it allows you to decrease, yes decrease, wages because the peasants get a 3% wage rise...and inflation is 7% (fucking lol). \n\nThis obviously doesn't in any way solve the problem of ever increasing debt and a populace earning less and less (in real terms) money but it does postpone having to deal with that and it does fulfill the function of a capitalist society perfectly. More money has gone from the poor to the rich than ever before and it looks like they think they can squeeze another couple of cycles of that before...I assume before they think they'll be snorting space cocaine off space ass but it might be the nukes for us and a couple of generations in underground lairs (that they've literally all built for themselves) for them and then back to speculative tulip markets. \n\nIt looks a fuck of a lot like everything's going perfectly for the people with all the money.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Holy shit.
