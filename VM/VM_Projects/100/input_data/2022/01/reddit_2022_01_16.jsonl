The crypto bubble in mining is substantially larger this time around than in 2018, Nvidia also has grabbed a far larger chunk of the GPU pie this time around.\n\nLast time AMD polaris were the bread and butter of hashpower with 1060/1070 coming in as secondaries. It wasn't until after the market peak in Q1 2018 for EHT that Nvidia cards were bought en masse due to the market being dry. You could still get a 1080 Ti at decent prices in early january that year. All in all Nvidia saw crypto demand drive their revenue from summer 2017 and a year after, but it was mainly Q4 2017 and Q1/Q2 2018 where the bulk was.\n\nThis time around Nvidia cards were bought for mining from almost day one. The first demand spike started 2-3 months after Ampere launched and has continued pretty much since. Then you had pandemic demand driving even further craze and margins/price as a result.\n\nNot only has Nvidia seen INSANE demand, they have also been able to charge whatever the fuck they want for what they have made. This has mainly taken the form that they just focused on making higher end cards rather than lower margin products. When normal market conditions return and crypto demand dies down, then we will see Nvidia sales implode.   \n\nAdd to this that AMD barely even has wanted to compete with Nvidia during this time, despite having decent products. They have been wafer constrained and would rather sell CPUs. Then you have Intel entering the space as well, they will mainly be concerned about gaining market share at first rather than profits.

This has the effect of A) Increasing hardware profits in the future when they become the household name for VR, allowing them to skew their profits into hardware sales rather than the controversial ad-business they are trying to steer their image away from, and B) not having to compete in the software space, instead focusing on the same factors Apple focuses on, which is a smooth, premium user experience that drives hardware sales and future loyalty in the ecosystem and $$$$$$\n\nOf course Facebook is going to have their own VR apps like Workrooms and Worlds, in the same way that the iPhone has iMessage and FaceTime, but those are used to augment your hardware experience, which is an important distinction, because I can still use FaceTime and iMessage to talk to someone on another brand of cell phone.

This because the Metaverse is supposed to solve a problem that we currently have with the technology that we have. Which is the digital items we buy stay stuck within a closed eco system. For example, if we were to buy an ebook from Amazon, we cannot resell it, we cannot lend it to others. If we were to buy digital clothes on Fortnite, we cannot bring it into the real world. In essence, these things that we own we cannot control where they will go. For comparison, I can sell a real book at a second hand store, and I can bring my IRL clothes to the digital world with a photo. \n\nThere are two technologies that will solve this. Products sold as NFTs will allow us to move these products between web3 platforms, and even resell them as used digital goods. AR will allow us. To bring our digital goods into the real world, and VR will allow us to transport ourselves to our virtual houses.\n\nTo me, this is the true value of the Metaverse and the reason why out of all the companies, it is probably Facebook who has the current culture and finances to dominate.\n\nWhy, because they integrate into lots of different technologies and even connect various sites to Facebook making them a central hub of the internet. Think of Facebook as ancient Rome, and all roads lead there. \n\nFor comparison, platforms such as iOS are closed (similar to how Japan was closed) and fight very hard to ensure that it stay that way.\nGoogle is somewhere in the middle, and so is Amazon.\n\nMoreover, Facebook/meta has been fighting closed eco systems like Apple to open up.\n\nWith that said, I would recommend keeping an eye on where developers are going.

That is approaching double the size of Toyota’s on a significantly higher ASP too. Toyota has an ASP of roughly $28k. So Tesla has almost double the margin and almost double the ASP at $51k. Not exactly hard to see how these numbers play out as Tesla sells increasingly more cars.\n\nToyota is run by a management team that is struggling to safe face in admitting it got things completely wrong with their vision of hydrogen and also walking away from Tesla and electric cars. It’s going to be a long road for Toyota.\n\nCars may be Toyota’s and VW’s bread and butter, however, electric cars are not, nor is their software or manufacturing. They will need to through incredible amounts of resources to get to where Tesla is now, and by then Tesla will be even further ahead. If you think the only difference is battery technology, good luck with that. That Apple considers Tesla to be a level two company for benchmarking remuneration speaks volumes regarding the difference between Tesl and other car makers.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "You do realize high ASP is already baked into the high gross margin. You can’t count on both being an advantage. Also as Tesla ramps up their volumes on the lower end their gross margins will dip much more significantly than the move to Berlin or Texas will help. In 10 years these companies will have similar gross margins, unless Tesla can remain a luxury player, which I doubt. \nMercedes and BMW will likely eat up that slot. \n\nYeah you’re right I was using old metrics. They’re at 30%. But again. The lowering of ASP in coming years in order to her Toyotas type of volume means their margins will decrease a lot and settle likely in the mid 20s. \n\nAll I am saying is that The world will learn from teslas innovations. And in 10 years the playing field will be much more level. And what is Tesla going to offer to magically own the giant share of the pie ? \nNot to mention when apple enters they can easily take the lead as the most popular and take 15% share. Leaving others with 5-6% to share, including Tesla. My bet is Tesla owns 8% market share of EVs in 2032. \n\nI think Tesla could easily be worth 3T in 5 years simply based on the stock market growing and hype. But not based on any numbers that make sense.

Some of the most pessimistic estimates, from AutoForecast Solutions, predict electric vehicles will make up about 23% of the market by 2030, with 18.6% of U.S. sales going to all-electric cars and trucks.

I drive a Mercedes and I’m waiting for my MYLR.

Honda Civics are already selling over $30k for some trim levels in the US, and I’m not talking Type R. Once Tesla gets the Cybertruck line rolling, you’re talking significant ASP for that line and high quantities.

People continually blame supply but it's really the demand that went up due to easy money policies, pausing mortgages and rent payments, loan modifications, etc. This isn't a natural supply problem but one created by the government. On top of this, the US is currently in the process of building more homes than at any point since 07.

I then look for signs of support and resistance and see how strong it is on either side based on how many examples and how much volume is in each space, and also the market condition at the time.\n\nI also then look for patterns and channel trends and build a confidence on a direction from there.

It was most definitely a crash, given that it was a liquidity crisis due to the breakdown of the economic engine of the economy causing a divergence between ability to pay money into the rotating economy compared to the need to pay it into debts and obligations, resulting in a >30% market drawdown.\n\nThat is the very definition of a crash. The problem is that people apply mean reversion to the market and think \"thing go up big, must go down big!\" which works under normal circumstances, and is intertwined with signal biases in identifying bubbles.\n\nPeople assess bubbles by looking at curves and PE ratios, which are statistical artifacts of bubbles, but here's the problem:\n\nEverybody cites the expansion of capital in the market as the reason the market expanded, but never considers that in assessment of how the market reacted to the liquidity crisis and where that's going and never include it in their bubble assessment.\n\nIt's a basic fact of mean reversion methodologies (which relate to bubble crashes) that once you change the underlying liquidity in the market, the factors of mean reversion and valuation multiple positioning changes, as it did after 2010. People kept predicting mean reversion there, and it never happened because the baseline liquidity in the market changed.\n\nThis happens in stocks all the time. In fact, we're watching it happen right now:\n\nMean reversion should mean that CLOV will eventually go back to $16/share, but that assumes that the interest and available float are the same, and they are not, which is why CLOV keeps dropping.\n\nEconomists who assume crashes must be long lasting mean reversion to be a crash are falling into the same psychological bias pit that people who constantly buy into CLOV thinking it's going to go back up are in. It's all belief, no science.\n\nIn the science of economics, markets expand against their liquidity backdrop, and as long as that liquidity in the active market is expanding or the same, a crash is not guaranteed. Bubbles exist when you have the same rough amount of money in the market and a lot of it goes to one thing... in the 2000-2001 crash, the primary issue with the liquidity in the market ultimately was due to bad accounting reducing value in the market, we then went through an elongated period of low fundamental liquidity because of bad economics during the Bush administration creating a problematic economic divergence problem. The tech bubble in 2000 HAD to crash because the same money in the economy had to start competing for debt-generating living costs as inflation drove up the costs of housing, etc, while real wages were declining and large markets were leaving the country resulting in downward fortunes for much of the country... but there was also a hard market valuation scandal driving the decline in relative valuations, which is why it took so long to recover.\n\nIn that circumstance, because there was no capital liquidity backing, all the market could do was revert down and the lack of capital influx resulted in a lack of capital generative capability. A similar thing happened in 2008, but QE ultimately hid the real depth of the crisis by propping up the banks and getting rotational payroll and credit provision moving again.\n\nThe same circumstances happened in 2020 as far as liquidity was concerned... but the added liquidity from the Fed combined with fiscal stimulus and the fact that the liquidity event was due to a pandemic have everything to do with the duration of the crash. Expecting a pandemic-driven crash to have the length and depth of a normal bubble crash, especially in the face of an elevated market liquidity expansion that will be draining into the economy via bank lending for the next 10 years... that's not science, that's belief. The science says it was a crash and did what it should have done. I initially doubted it, but after spending a LOT of time looking into it I'm comfortable saying that.\n\nHaving said that, I agree completely with the point of not being overleveraged going into a crash. People who pull money out at the top and then buy in at the bottom obviously do better, but like you said timing the bottom is also far more problematic than it looks on a chart. \n\nIn the end, though, most of the bear theses on here are no more complex than any other blind mean reversion assumption... and that's the problem. Timing a crash is just as problematic as timing the bottom. \"Everything must revert down\" is the same bias as \"all stocks must go up.\"\n\nThe strategy this year, with softening monetary accomodation, will favor stock pickers and volatility capture... but that's tough, so the other strategy is to dollar cost average over time keeping a lot of capital free to buy dips but not overleverage. Volatility capture will beat that by a wide margin, but can also beat it on losses by a wide margin, too.
