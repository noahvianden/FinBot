They will now stop injecting $120 Billion in purchases each month by QE.  That’s called tampering, and the end will be March.  Also,  they will raise the Fed Funds Rate to a whopping 1% by four .25% increases this year.\n\nUnfortunately, that won’t be enough to kill inflation.  In the early 80’s, it took a Fed Funds Rate of almost 10% to stop inflation. If the Fed increases the Fed Funds Rate too high (like 4-5%) and/or sells off its 9 Trillion in purchased assets, then the stock market will crash and then the economy will crash too.

Eventually these risks result in re-balancing until they figure out a way around it. Some have, but not all. \n\nThis is the point of fiat. Its to combat concentration of wealth which was the big problem with the gold standard. Its a democratic form of economy. The voters control the policy via their representatives rather than people who hold the gold (or whatever asset it is).  \n\nTo answer your question directly, then I am going to say both do the same thing, but with the caveat that republicans are simply worse at this time. Here is the explanation to that:\n\nWith exception to Clinton, most recent president had deficit spending. The reasons might have varied but in general, that how it is with the fiat system. I would also argue that even with Clinton, it wasnt so much that he wanted to balance things, but rather he was the beneficiary of a improving economic cycle and it ended up balancing. \n\nBoth Reagan and Trump inherited something similar to Clinton. They came off a bad economy and entered a good cycle when they took office. With Reagan, the economy was turning before his economic policies even took effect the following year. Trump simply fell into a good economy right off the bat. But both Trump and Reagan elected to muck with the core of the system to try and pump it even more. Instead of taking a step back once things got good and save for a rainy day, they decided to take their dicks out and waive them around. They wanted a boy scout badge for the best economy ever.

They will now stop injecting $120 Billion in purchases each month by QE.  That’s called tampering, and the end will be March.  Also,  they will raise the Fed Funds Rate to a whopping 1% by four .25% increases this year.\n\nUnfortunately, that won’t be enough to kill inflation.  In the early 80’s, it took a Fed Funds Rate of almost 10% to stop inflation. If the Fed increases the Fed Funds Rate too high (like 4-5%) and/or sells off its 9 Trillion in purchased assets, then the stock market will crash and then the economy will crash too. Also, that higher level will cause tons of money to pay interest on the 30 Trillion debt.\n\nThink late 2018, when the market crashed when there was a threat of a 2.5% Fed Funds Rate.  Inflation wasn’t even that bad then.\n\nSo, if the stock market, and later the economy, crashed with a mere 2% Fed Funds Rate, then the Fed will pivot back to what they’ve been doing.

What would a supermarket that wanted to avoid 4% Credit Card fees look like that had BTC listed along prices in USD?  What would happen over the long term is your USD price would keep going up, currently 7% a year, and your price in BTC would keep going down, as wallets are lost at something like 4% a year.

If the original CPI calculation methodology is used (pre 1980), inflation sits closer to 15% and is higher than any point in the 70s and is actually the highest rate we’ve experienced since 1947 under Truman. (Second chart at the linked URL)\n\n\n\n\nSee the website above for a more detailed and statistics/based on explanation of what follows:\n\nIn the 80s and then again in the 90s, congress began messing with the methodology for calculating CPI, which had the effect of suppressing official inflation numbers every since. \n\nAt the time, the talking points were that they were “fixing it”. But as the author of this site goes into detail on, the modifications were not uniform but rather arbitrarily applied or not applied to different price indices (much more manipulation). Other rules such as ‘substitution’ and ‘improvement’ at best changed what the CPI represented, it was no longer a true cost of living measure, and at worst simply manipulative to achieve a desired result (lower numbers). \n\nWhat political motivations could have caused this to transpire you ask? A political climate that sought to reduce Federal obligations to things that were and are tied to the index. For example, cost of living adjustments to social security. For a Republican controlled congress, they had also pushed the narrative that the party had “fixed” the problems of the 70s with their policies under Reagan and Bush, so they had a vested interest in obscuring the fact that inflation had been ticking up and that this was not the case. The “neoliberal” Democratic Party under Clinton was also not monumentally opposed to these policies. This is not an attempt to criticise either party, but rather a statement of fact in how the landscape changed in the US after Reagan; post WWII political and economic philosophy was dead. \n\nWether or not you agree with the reasons behind it, or the political nature of the changes, the fact is that we must compare apples to apples. Therefore, when discussing a measure such as CPI and inflation, when referencing the 70s (or any time before the 80s) we must use the same methodology they did then.\n\nEdit: detailed breakdown here http://www.shadowstats.com/article/no-438-public-comment-on-inflation-measurement", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Let the fuck stock crash so I can buy dip", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Now do REAL inflation with home and used car sales incorporated in the calculations not just a cherry picked basket of goods", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Thanks Biden", "score": 0, "replies": []}, {"body": "Wow, Biden is as bad as Carter.", "score": -4, "replies": []}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": -3, "replies": [{"body": "Who the fuck in this thread is happy to see 7%?", "score": 10, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Only dozens of items?", "score": 0, "replies": []}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Stop (fed) spending.

Like you my first trade was a big winner 1500% on Disney back in 2019. Long calls and only a week after buying them. I felt like a rockstar. I knew nothing. (1) never place a market order on options. Volume on most is usually low and a market maker will bend you over. You only need to learn this lesson once. Place a limit every time. You can always adjust every minute or so until it gets filled. Don’t be greedy if you want a quick trade, but still use a limit order. (2) learn your Greeks. Volatility and Decay will work you over if you don’t understand how they work. (3) learn to read charts and don’t get too greedy or too foolish on a loss, if it’s moving strongly, assess the chart and exit when it tells you to. Don’t stay in a position on gut instinct. (4) If you have a big win or loss, usually it’s best to remove that one from your watch list and don’t trade it again for a while. Indexes are a bit different. Not only will bias kill you but until you understand volatility, you’ll think it’s gonna print more than it did before. Unless you’re religious to your rules or charts, stay away.

What do you foresee happening - the Fed has already announced they will do Quantitative Tightening and hiking interest rates. Basically opposite of what they have been doing which drove the market to all time highs and tech stocks to have high valuations, frenzy in new asset class like crypto, NFT, etc. So, when the Fed reverses their policies, it is logical to expect the reverse effect in the market. The key is inflation rate. Will it be as expected, or surprise the Fed on the upside, or the downside. The market will react depending on what it has priced in.\n\n2. How long is the downturn portion of the cycle - depends whom you listen to. According to Dalio, the cycle is way overdue for a downturn, and the longer the tightening measures are postponed, the bigger the downturn will be. 6 months, 1 year, even 2 years would not be unreasonable to expect, depending on whether the Fed handles the QT and interest rate correctly, or whether they overdo it and inadvertently cause an over correction or worse. For a contrarian view, listen to Cathie W. I suspect the outcome would be somewhere in between the two ends of the spectrum. \n\n3. Is Tesla a bubble that will correct to 500? The Tesla we know today is quite different from Tesla prior to the pandemic. Look at the numbers in Q4 compared to 2 years ago. Tesla has paid down debt, has a strong cash flow, high industry-leading profit margins, strong demand pipeline, strong product lineup, global footprint that is expanding rapidly, ongoing technological research and breakthroughs, incredible growth especially considering the size they have reached, and if you can find such numbers else where, please let me know, I would take up a position.

I wish I didn’t listen to it because it gave me a disturbed sleep!\n\nThere was this one Aussie guy on there (can’t remember his handle) who’s main argument against Tesla was:\n\n- Elon’s timelines are unrealistic (duh) but that his “promises or Robotaxis” have inflated the stock price to what it is today and he has benefited from this\n- Elon is naïve when it comes to regulations and working with governments; he often doesn’t know how long they normally take to approve things etc. and he should step down as the spokesperson (and this person claimed that he actually was going to step down soon as well?)\n- Tesla set the goal to bring EV’s mainstream and to bring every other car company up with it - and this person thought that this meant that Tesla shouldn’t become monopolistic because that’s not bringing others “up” and that Tesla is trending towards becoming a monopoly and that was “bad”. That they are planing to build many more factories, have “closed off” charging networks, etc.\n\nMaybe I myself am being naïve because I’ve never heard arguments like this before (except maybe stock manipulation but never tired to Robotaxi promises). But I can’t disagree with these thoughts more!\n\n- first, I’m sure Elon will be the first to admit that his timelines are unrealistic. But it’s clear that he pushes soooo hard that, even things that would be considered decades away, become reality in Loren less than half that excepted time frame. If he didn’t push, we wouldn’t have these amazing products. How impressively fast have factories being built go ground ground-break to basically ready for production? Unprecedented!\n- second, so what if he’s naïve? I personally don’t think he is, but I think he’s made it clear that some old regulation, put into place in some time in the past that might not be relevant to today, should be “deleted” and not hinder progress. And really, why should it take so long to that? Why does it take so long to approve something? (There may be legit reasons so maybe he needs to slow down a tad, and the regulators need to get a move on more!) It’s clear he’s not totally against regulations either. \n- third, Tesla is not some altruistic entity who exists to share technology and bail out all other OEMs so that they can have a shot at making EVs too. No, he wants to make EVs mainstream by saying “we are going to make the most compelling product for the consumer, we’re not going to focus on anything else or what any of you are doing, so you better bloody try hard to beat us or you will lose”. And I think that Elon genuinely wants the others to try and beat Tesla because he knows that’s the only way they will respond. It’s the “forcing function” as he often likes to say. So if the others took waaay too long to respond, and Tesla then had the lead, and continues to grown on that lead, then tough fucking shit! Everyone had their chance, but they failed. Tesla is still achieving their goals, they are just doing it basically single handedly for now. And how can you call Tesla a “monopoly” when all other OEM’s are still pumping out _millions_ of gas guzzlers combined?

I have one concern as I read a few other investors here share similar sentiments...\n\nAnd that is...  Some people are fearing an economic downturn cycle coming up (especially for growth stocks like Tesla).\n\nI'd like to get a consensus from you dear friends and investors... Like... What is this worry all about?  I do realize there are strong indicators that the FED (Powell) has recently indicated that in March, the Federal interest rates will be hiked up and liquidity (bond buying may further taper and reduce).   But what do you guys think about the results of this on Tesla stock price for Q1 through Q4 of this year? \n\nIm not panicking but I certainly want those of you seasoned investors who are in the know about Tesla price pressures at various times and cycles of the year to please educate me because I'm sitting on about 200 shares of Tesla which I have paid dearly for... And need to know if after Q4 results, do you guys believe we're headed for a massive correction starting March and going all the way through June or August?  Or do you believe regardless of what the Fed does... The fundamentals will outweigh any Macros and with two new Gigas (Austin & Berlin about to start delivering) we will be seeing record growth quarter after quarter as YouTube host Steven Mac Ryan of Australia seems to be championing?\n\nSo my situation is that I hold and manage 160 shares of Tesla in a family account (at $816 average price from last years purchases). \nI also hold 20 shares of Tesla in my own personal account at average price of $1000.\n\nI don't need the funds anytime soon.  But I also want to have some sense in advance... Like are we seriously headed for some kind of unexpected surprise downturn cycle for Tesla starting March?\nIf yes, how badly can Tesla stock price tank down (like what levels are within possible set of outcomes)?  And how long could such a serious downturn Last?\n\nAgain for the record I state I'm a huge Tesla fan and Bull!  I believe in their mission and their business model.  But I also don't want to be blind to any major downturns we may be heading towards and am just trying to get some helpful constructive feedbacks to better decide if I should seriously consider trimming my position?\n\nAnd if you do recommend trimming (which with a stock like Tesla is never a good idea long term)...

Or would you do so immediately after (like the next day or so)?\n\nThank you all so much 👍", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "No one can predict a market downturn so if you have a generational winner on your hands like you do with TSLA, don't play with fire.\n\nCould we get a big recession this year?

They were down substantially but very quickly rebound and stagnated for some time as ~2010-2014 was not good for stocks in general.\nTesla itself went down from ~1100 to 330$ within few days in March 2020 (didn't sell, bought more at the time of first lockdowns even though for many of us the world was ending).\nMy understanding of some macro events and recession in particular is that recession starts to reveal true value of companies although the start of it will pressure almost all stocks to downside substantially. But after longer term (1 year typically) if Tesla will still grow in revenue, margins will not collapse, FCF is solid then market will react to that and money will flow again as it will be seen as undervalued in the next cycle.\nJust like Apple revealed iPhone prior to recession (and it was major one) it didn't stop them to rip-off huge marketshare as product was that good and disruptive for the mobile sector (or rather it created smartphone sector on its own).\nI can see similarities with Tesla on this one.\n\nAs of earnings Q3 2021 and modeling Q4 2021 the grow of profit is so huge (I believe that GAAP net profit will be at least 2,4-2,5B $ in Q4) that annualized PE ratio probably will dip further down to about 100x.\nThat is massive upgrade which is reasonable for tech company growing that fast which I personally take as the recession (revealing of the true company value) will not burst it to the ground as there is no more actuall buble on the stock anymore. Initiall fear of busting sales volumes will be gone when people will still buy the product.\n\nAlso with projected growth and margin expansion I could not handle myself to compare Tesla to Apple.\nI believe in 2025 revenue will be somewhere on 200-250B $ ballpark and net profit somewhere on 40-60B $ (~4mln of S+X+3+Y+CyberTruck).\nThat is where Apple since about 2017-2018 had like 2T+ valuation.\nThe more I think of it I see that story as Apple last decade story.\nAnd 4mln cars (factories for that are already there just more phases of extension Austin and Berlin) is not that much. There will be still potential after that time and huge FSD/AI wildcards in the game.\n\nDon't believe me on that do Your own research because that is not financial advice.\nAlso my situation is I've already bought house (at least that come with my initiall sell-off of TSLA) with minor mortgage. That is why I believe I can handle potential downturn of stocks in general (\"frozing\" of invested money).\n\nI guess basically what I'm trying to say is - the time of throwing money at a sector and high probability of good returns is over.

Or do I just sit back like an idiot and watch all the gains vanish by the end of that same next day or the following day?\n\nAlso... What are your views about the macro situation starting in March?  Some see the Fed increasing rates more and this could Hammer Tesla stock price until towards the end of the year (once again a kind of repeat like we've seen in prior years where early in the year by Q4 reports we see Tesla skyrocket... But only to soon thereafter tank like mad by at least 40% before starting to snake back up towards the end of the year)?\n\nYour thoughts about how you kinda see things playing out are much appreciated.

I fear that we may reach say 1400 or so right after Q4 and then soon begin going way way down?\n\nWhat do you think you would do?\nJust hold through all this or create a plan to take profits where profits are due?

Cities (at least in the west) usually:\n\n* Start with a small system, but it's so small and has such limited service that most people don't use it, and so there's very little public support for spending more on it\n* Start with a \"big\" system, which almost always takes much longer to build than expected and costs more to build and operate than originally estimated. And so even if the system is popular, there's not the political will to commit to any expansion. And if it is popular, it ends up crowded during rush hour, and so riders end up dissatisfied\n\nThere are some bigger cities, that start with a few lines that do well, and then they add other similar sized lines to connect other boroughs/neighborhoods/suburbs. But they still run in to problems expanding capacity along existing lines. Digging more tunnels or adding more cars or expanding stations can be incredibly expensive and also disruptive to service.\n\nEven if a Boring tunnel \"loop\" never ends up being as efficient as a subway line, or as flexible as bus service, it can still make a lot of sense.

{"title": "The Fed is trapped, they have to hike rates, but they wont make it very far before breaking the markets this time. I predict only 5 rate hikes this cycle, details below", "selftext": "The fed has fucked up.  Inflation wasn't transitory and their favorite measure, core PCE, is the highest it's been in 4 decades.\n\nNow they have to look like they are fighting inflation by raising rates and tapering asset purchases.  They are talking quite a big game right now.  Many fed officials are talking about a fed funds rate at 3-4% and several are even mentioning balance sheet runoff.\n\nI'm here to tell you they are completely full of shit.  We won't even get close to 4% fed funds rate this cycle.  And that's because as a nation we are increasingly dependent on low interest rates to finance the national debt (as well as private debt).\n\nThat's because the national debt has absolutely exploded over time.  Debt to GDP has increased from 30% in the 70s to 125% now.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/767ffk2tx5b81.png?width=1918&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b3beaabaa8f5ffdb07d31b660c0341055d61945\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis massive increase in the debt means that interest payments on that debt increase as the fed raises interest rates.  Thus every hiking cycle for the past 40 years has resulted in a lower and lower peak fed funds rate before the market breaks and the fed capitulates and begins easing again (aka the money printer kicks into high gear).  The last peak in 2018 was a fed funds rate of 2.25-2.50% before markets plunged 25% in the 4th quarter.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sn4shjqky5b81.png?width=1226&format=png&auto=webp&s=31e9984d76d5aab315817cb563733df3e8662e14\n\nBut the debt is even higher now than it was in 2018, so we know the next ceiling will have to be lower as well.  I've analyzed this by looking at the average of the fed funds rate and the 5-year treasury yield and multiplying this combined rate by the national debt.\n\nIf we assume both rates increase in tandem by 25 basis points per quarter, and the national debt goes up a paltry $300 billion quarterly (its been going up much faster than this recently), then we will cap out at just 1.25-1.50% this cycle.  Likely in the 2nd quarter of 2023.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rmvaredrw5b81.png?width=1344&format=png&auto=webp&s=75bb7bc23243c9f151daddc8aa979a71eb799680\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo when markets are crashing after only the 5th rate hike, and inflation is still running at over 5% annually, just know that the fed is going to capitulate and save the markets by easing again.\n\nThis is a big problem, because you need treasury yields to get above inflation expectations in order to encourage savings instead of spending to stop inflation.  In the 70s, with debt to GDP at only 30%, we were able to do just that.  It wasn't painless (look at the recession of the early 80s), but we did it.  With inflation at 5-10%, we can't even get close to stopping it without absolutely decimating the stock market and the economy.\n\nSo the fed is trapped.  They are going to have to choose between switching to easing and saving the economy and stock market, or continuing to hike in an attempt to kill inflation, but also causing the great depression 2.0 in the process.  I'm confident they will choose to save markets and stop fighting inflation as the tradeoff, which means that the inflation trades at that point will be going absolutely bananas.\n\nAnd that's because the US will finally be embarking on monetary policy akin to a banana republic by lowering rates while experiencing high inflation.\n\nSo make sure you get YOUR bananas over the next year to prepare for this utter bullshit of a ride that the fed is about to take us on.  For me that means precious metals (specifically silver via PSLV and physical, not SLV which is a bullshit ETF).  I also like platinum and uranium a lot as well. For others it could mean other commodities, energy plays, or real estate. Or even just buying a whole bunch of shit before it goes up in price.\n\nGood luck my friends, this is the end game!", "id": "s1uf49", "created_utc": 1641953376.0, "score": 8146, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 2028, "comments": [{"body": "As the king of banana republic, as briefly mentioned above by OP, I will accommodate the transition by offering  you 10% off on your banana futures.

Almost nobody actually paid the top tax rate because it was pointless to make that much money. This is not the counter argument you think it is. \n\nThe overall revenue may of been similar compared to GDP, but the sources were not.\n\n1960 Tax Revenue Sources:\nIncome Tax - 44%\nCorporate Income Tax - 23.2%\nSocial Insurance/Retirement Receipts - 15.9%\n(Mostly Social Security and Medicare)\nExcise Taxes - 12.6%\nOther - 4.2%\n\n2018 Tax Revenue Estimates:\nIncome Tax - 49.8%\nCorporate Income Tax - 11.3%\nSocial Insurance/Retirement Receipts - 32.9%\n(Mostly Social Security and Medicare)\nExcise Taxes - 3.1%\nOther - 3.6%\n\nThe main problem here is the changes in corporate taxes and social insurance taxes. Tax cuts to corporations is the same as giving a tax cut to the ultra wealthy that actually own these companies. It does not result in higher wages, lower prices, or anything of the sort. \n\nIn 1960 the top 1% earned 9% of all income and paid 13% of taxes. In 2008 the top 1% earned 20% and paid 38%. On the surface it seems like they’re paying more, but when you compare it to their share of total wealth now and then it’s not even close. This has gotten especially bad in the last 10 years as the top 10% and top 1% continue to own more and more of the total wealth at an accelerating rate. This all stems back to changes in tax and fiscal policy from the Reagan that were *intended* to shrink the middle class as the ruling class got scared. It worked, the middle class started shrinking and the ultra wealthy ruling class got back the wealth (but more importantly the power this brings) that they had been losing. Except this *never stopped*. These same policies are still being implemented today and the middle class is near nonexistent and wealth inequality is at all time historical highs for pretty much all of history anywhere.\n\nAs for social insurance taxes this is primarily borne by the working class. The biggest part of this is social security and the rest is Medicare. Social security is 6.2 of earnings matched by employers for an effective total of 12.4% of income. Medicare is the same way for a total of 2.9% of income. \n\nThe problem is that the tax for social security has an income cap. Only up to $127,000 (top 10% of individual incomes) can be taxed for social security. This means that once you start going above the top 10% of income you pay a lower tax rate. Which is regressive and kind of defeats the point of SS in the first place.\n\nAfter WW2 the US implemented extremely progressive tax, economic, and fiscal policy. This combined with the economic boom of the rest of the world having their industrial sector blown up and relying on the US led to the middle class growing at an incredible rate. It was the single best time and place for the working class in history. \n\n\nThe civil rights movement, anti-war movement, environmental movement, and other social movements of the 50s, 60s, and 70s were all born out of the rising wealth and expectations of the middle class after WW2. This sudden shift in power dynamic between the ruling class and the working class did not go over well with the ruling class and conservatives. They were terrified and losing the power they had held since basically forever. We saw the results of this with Reaganomics, which was just an attack on the working class. The ruling class had worked hard to spread the idea that the middle class getting to big would lead to social instability and eventual societal collapse. This was not a new concept and was already a many decades old thing. It’s full of fallacies and had already been disproven many times at this point. \n\nThe efforts of the ruling class came to fruition in 1980 when conservatives took back power for the first time in close to 40 years. Ever since then the only goal of the right wing has been to destroy the middle class and push the working class back down. They succeeded and wealth inequality trends started to reverse and start rising again. Except whoops, we went past where we were before. But it’s too late, the left wing in America has already been destroyed and neither party has any interest in stopping rising wealth inequality or rebuilding the middle class. All they really disagree on how fast they want wealth inequality to continue rising.\n\nWe’re facing down the barrel of a gun. Rising wealth inequality is unsustainable, it will inevitably result in some kind of economic and or societal collapse as it has historically. The greed of corporations and the ultra wealthy is what lead us to our current situation of nonexistent interest rates and huge debts everywhere, both national and personal. They will never stop the party of their own will for the sake of everyone else. They’ll lead us up the hill and then right off the cliff as the markets collapse. This is the exact same road the same class of people lead us on in the 20s resulting in the 1929 stock market collapse and the Great Depression.\n\nAt this point a market and economic crash are more or less inevitable. The only question is which straw will finally break the camels back. We’ve got rising domestic instability and political violence, the a resurgence of fascism globally, ballooning debts, out of control inflation, rising international tensions between the West and everyone else, climate change, and probably other shit I’m forgetting. If we had a political party in the US that had any interest in actually solving problems then we might have a chance to course correct.\n\nPersonally I don’t see us making it to 2040 before this happens. Unless you have an underground bunker city to run away to nobody can avoid it. The world is too interconnected nowadays, and the US is just a big enough domino to bring everyone else down with it. Economic collapse, the largest economy, fascism (mostly the xenophobia and ultra-nationalism part), and the worlds greatest military by a long stretch all in the same country is not a good recipe for the world.\n\nEdit: typo “compare income tax” to “corporate income tax”", "score": 29, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "The FED adds bonds to its balance sheet to suppress yields.

I’m not a sucker”\n\nWell…that works until you get laid off, have a life event, need to move for work, etc…and now you realize you have a negative net worth due to an albatross of a $599k loan on a $450k home. \n\n“Yeah, nice try - won’t happen to me”\n\nThat’s not my point. With 100 million households, it doesn’t matter what happens to any one individual.

Made great money. And I walked away from that career to do real estate development in 2012ish. \n\nThere was simply more opportunity in real estate at that point. The amount of foreclosures and houses I bought, and the amount of rentals that were being sold at 30% off (even in the Boston area) was staggering. \n\nAnd I make way more money now than as a biglaw lawyer. \n\nSo it’s not me coming from a place of “I hope they don’t do this, cause I’ll be fucked”. \n\nIt’s me coming from a place of “millions of folks will get massively fucked, they will sell at a loss, they will lose everything they have, and well capitalized folks like me will inevitably swoop in and buy property at distressed fire sale prices for banks who are doing short sales (for owners who could afford to pay the fixed rate mortgage, but who did the math and realized it was better to walk away from a negative $200k underwater home).\n\nSo sure…lots of folks who had subprime houses on ARMs in shitty parts of the country underwritten by Countrywide and WAMU defaulted on their mortgages. \n\nBut that wasn’t really what was happening in suburban Boston area (where I operate). Around me, the housing price collapse and liquidity constraints killed folks. \n\nSo we will see. \n\nIf the fed raises rates 17 times to 5.25%…we will see a housing collapse. \n\nI hope for everyone else’s sake I’m wrong.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": ">\tIf the fed raises rates 17 times to 5.25%…we will see a housing collapse.\n\nI don’t know if they’ll go that far, enough to cause some pain for sure.

Debt\\*Rate is a sum of money that the fed (ECB, etc.) must pay.\n3. Point #1 means that raising rates means spending lots of money on interest payments.\n4. Paying lots of money in interest payments means debt grows even faster.\n5. Paying lots of money in interest payments also means more money \"in the wild,\" causing inflation.\n6. The Fed's (ECB, etc) solution  to inflation is raising rates.... vicious cycle.\n\n**B.** End games don't end the game. There is always more game.\n\n1. There are other ways to control inflation, at least in theory. Taxes, for example. Also spending cuts, rationing, exports. They could even take a leaf out of Xi's book and send Bezos to teach schoolchildren in Alaska with Ma. \n2. Fed rates have never really been a great way of controlling inflation anyway.\n3. The debt isn't really real, in some sense. If rates are set to 0% forever, that debt is pretty theoretical.\n4. Under the current game, there's no market discipline on interest rates. The Fed can do what it wants, including 0%.\n\nMedium-Long term, changing the rules of the game is probably inevitable. Debt/GDP will continue to rise, just like Japan. We've been playing this game for 40-50 years... ish. It's reached an endpoint. New game soon.\n\nMy guess is that the new game means dropping rates as an inflation control. It might mean just accepting inflation. As long as it doesn't  spiral, there are some positives to inflation... some people benefit from it.  \n\nMaybe they print dollars and convert all outstanding securities to non yielding deposits. IE pay off the debt.  That's a reset button. Debt/GDP goes back to 0 and we can play the game again. Maybe they just declare 0-interest forever, and there's no difference between dollars and dollar securities.\n\nYes, the Fed is in a trap. But, it's a trap they built and they also have the keys.

{"title": "A Company to Profit HANDSOMELY from the Energy Crisis", "selftext": "\n**GEWD MORNING**\n-\nI'm back with updates!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMonths ago, I stated the demand and importance of LNG in the upcoming years? Yeeeeaaah, well those needs came quicker. There is now a global energy CRISIS:\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-04/europe-s-energy-supply-crisis-has-the-eu-at-the-mercy-of-putin-and-the-weather\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_global_energy_crisis\n\nIt used to be harder for fossil fuel start-ups to get bank financing due to not being viewed as \"green\".  But now that, you know, there is an energy crisis, the EU is trying to get nuclear and LNG fuels listed as GREEN. For those that have a chromosome tolerance of ± 1, LNG is the cleanest burning fossil fuel and is poised to be the energy source for the foreseeable future. https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/02/business/europe-green-investments-nuclear-natural-gas.html\n\nBecause of this current climate, it has set Tellurian to EXPLODE. I know, I know, most of you don't know how to operate the shiny buttons on the TV, so you may have not seen the news. Have a parent or guardian help you with viewing the current crisis unfolding in front of your useless eyes.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**To summarize from my last DD:**\nTellurian is building Driftwood which is \"developing a liquefied natural gas (LNG) production and export terminal on the west bank of the Calcasieu River, south of Lake Charles, Louisiana. Once complete, the terminal will be able to export up to twenty-seven million, six hundred thousand tonnes of LNG per year to customers worldwide.\"\n\nCharif Souki started Tellurian. If you don’t know who he is, he is a LNG god. He was a banker on Wall St, highest paid CEO years ago, and pioneered the LNG industry. If you want to build a LNG empire, you hire Souki, if you want to know the future of hydrocarbon energy, you hire Souki, if you want a new boyfriend for your wife, you hire Souki. He built Cheniere Energy, the first company to export LNG from the US. A company with $10billion in revenue and is trading $80/share(**updated: now at $100+/share**).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTellurian has multi-billion dollar LNG purchase agreements with: Gunvor, Vitol, and Shell.\nhttps://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/natural-gas/072921-shell-agrees-to-buy-3-million-mtyear-of-supply-from-tellurians-driftwood-lng\n\n**When these deals were signed, JKM pricing was in the $10-15 range. We are now +$30 and climbing!**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Due to covid and all, Driftwood construction was delayed. New timeline:**\n\nSyndicate announcement: This month Jan 2022\n\nFinal Investment Decision (FID): 1Q22\n\nBechtel construction Notice to Proceed (NTP): 1Q22\n\nBechtel construction begin: early 2Q22\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Many signals aligning giving evidence to something big brewing:**\n\n-Multiple job listings for Tellurian have been posted in the recent months. \n-Tellurian's Linkedin shows they have filled many job openings with top-of-the-line hires.\n-On Jan 6 2022, Tellurians K-8 shows \"approved the issuance of 174,942 restricted stock units to Mr. Granmayeh, the Company’s Chief Financial Officer. Each restricted stock unit \n    represents a contingent right to receive on or within thirty days after vesting one share of Tellurian common stock, cash of equal value, or a combination of both, as \n    determined by the Company in its sole discretion. The restricted stock units generally will vest in one-third increments upon an affirmative final investment decision by the \n    Board with respect to the Driftwood liquefied natural gas project and the first two anniversaries thereof.\"\n-Souki released a YouTube video this morning (1/11/2022) reaffirming this FID and construction timeline; it's right around the corner. He also stated that banks' attitudes toward \n    energy financing have dramatically changed over the last 6 months because of the crisis as explained above.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**I VISITED ONGOING CONSTRUCTION:**\n\nDOT is mandating that highways leading to Driftwood need to be widened to accept construction traffic. This construction is currently underway as well as power utility company running new power lines.\n\nAs stated in my last DD, I work in the area. I decided to drop by the construction site and take some pictures and videos for those who can't read. I also asked some questions to construction workers. \n\n**Here are my findings:**\n\nI talked to a gas station owner who is located on the Driftwood highway. He confirmed that TELL was doing the work. I asked him when construction would begin, and he confirmed March or April. I asked more questions and he directed me to Tellurian's temporary office. I drove by but didn't see anyone around. As I was leaving the office, I flagged down a truck slowly passing me. He works for a company who has a lot of land in the area. He said a \"company\" was clearing a bunch of trees and making driveways into the woods. He pointed in the direction that the Driftwood terminal will be built.\n\nNext, I talked to one of the construction flaggers located a few hundred yards from the office. He works for Entergy (power company for those who don't know). He said they are running new power lines - I assume these are power lines for Driftwood. They're doing some pretty serious work headed in the direction of Driftwood. Power for Driftwood will be a serious power addition; I doubt Entergy would be making these additions unless Driftwood construction was certain.\n\nThen, I stopped next to a truck that had been watching the road construction crew (he was the construction supervisor). I asked him if the road construction was for Tellurian. He said yes and that things were going well. I asked him when he expects to finish, he said JULY! I asked him if Tellurian had been pressuring them on a constrained timeline. He said, \"No, actually they gave us certain deadlines for certain stages AND WE ARE WELL AHEAD OF THEIR DEADLINE.\".\n\nI asked him if they need to finish the road work before Driftwood construction can begin. He said \"No, they can start bringing in equipment while we're working. Our main goal is finishing the turnoff from the main highway so that we are not impeding traffic.\". I asked him if he worked for Tellurian, he told me no but the guy in the truck next to him did.\n\nSo I walked over to the Tellurian employee's window and asked how things were going. Super nice guy. He said things are going very well. I asked him if they are still expected to start construction in the second quarter. He confidently said, \"Oh yes, construction in the second quarter.\".\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSee this link for my pictures and videos of the ongoing construction.\nhttps://1drv.ms/f/s!Anxr6tk-0ohkgZxJUAZcVhf7p-wPAQ\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Tl;dr and additional facts:** \n\n\n-Undervalued company is about to build an LNG plant that will help mitigate the global energy crisis.\n\n\n-The current energy crisis and potential EU classification of LNG as \"green\" crafts a perfect \n    environment to finalize financing of the Tellurian Driftwood LNG facility. \n\n\n-This morning, Tellurian's founder Charif Souki, industry legend, reaffirmed the financing and \n    construction timeline. \n\n\n-Tellurian has been actively posting and hiring important positions in the company with top-of-the-line hires. \n\n\n-On site road construction workers, a local gas station owner, and a Tellurian employee \n    confirmed construction timelines.\n\n\n-$80 million in revenue this year, $200 million in revenue next year - exponential growth baby!\n\n\n-Stock has recently up listed to NYSE\n\n\n-Stock has been added to Russel 2000 and 3000 as of 11/24/21\n\n\n-Earnings have doubled since last year and stock price is not reflecting the rapid growth as of yet.\n\n\n-Europe is burning coal as their renewables are not providing what they need\n\n\n-TELL estimates they will account for 24% of global natural gas supply\n\n\n-Carbon futures in Europe are screaming higher\n\n\n-LNG prices in Europe and Asia are ridiculously expensive compared to USA Henry Hub prices\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Price predictions:** \n\n\nprice after FID: $6-8\n\n\nprice after NTP: $10-15\n\n\nprice mid-construction: $20-30\n\n\nprice after first liquification train is complete: $50-70", "id": "s27egf", "created_utc": 1641997276.0, "score": 240, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 97, "comments": [{"body": "Loving the $TELL vibe today ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)", "score": 34, "replies": []}, {"body": "Good article on Tell.

Consider that the gaming and metaverse industries grow faster and have more margin/cash flow potential than autos, insurance, or renewables. Ryan Cohen is not just rejuvenating a retailer. \n\nRyan is building a tech giant. He's poaching from tech giants. He achieved the balance sheet ratios of a tech giant during the squeezes. He has the strategic vision, focus, skin in the game, and conservative financial approach of a tech giant founder. He *is* a tech founder/billionaire (Chewy). Current tech giants have physical footprints the same size as GameStop or larger. Ryan knows what the potential is, which is why he hasn't sold a single share despite being up 2,135% as of today's close.\n\nPower comes from strategic position. GameStop is not in a powerful position, but Ryan took on this project because he saw the necessary elements and a path to achieve a powerful position. Since then he's been working his ass off for shareholders with this as his sole focus.\n\nYou didn't see much tangible progress, because the first year was the secretive, big-picture stage. He has promised the market nothing and he will easily over deliver this year. None of this is new information, but it is missing from any Wall St take on GME. They're too busy laughing at apes a year later.\n\nThe downside is also limited. There's\nlittle debt and lots of cash. Revenue, operating margin, and free cash flow are all rising underneath the moon potential with Ryan Cohen. No accounting gimmicks, very little share based compensation, and a tiny enterprise value make a solid platform for our rocket, too. Your move, Wall St.\n\nTL;DR: I like the stock.", "id": "s2j75i", "created_utc": 1642027373.0, "score": 1044, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 227, "comments": [{"body": "Even though I'm six levels of retarded, and it's easily possible I missed this, but I didn't see any 🚀🚀🚀", "score": 305, "replies": [{"body": "Who needs rocket emojis when you're on board a real one?", "score": 180, "replies": [{"body": "Rocket emojis make it go up 🚀 otherwise it go down", "score": 66, "replies": [{"body": "Speaking of solid DD", "score": 33, "replies": []}, {"body": "I invest solely based on number of rocket emojis and whether or not the OP started their post with \"listen up, retards!\"", "score": 19, "replies": []}, {"body": "This is the way", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "It is an unquestionable truth that you, my good sir, do indeed fuck.", "score": 23, "replies": []}, {"body": "We need new emoji now that shows people outside waving at us..🙋‍♂️🙋‍♂️🙋‍♂️🚀🚀🚀", "score": 8, "replies": []}, {"body": "He’s just mad you didn’t dumb down your thesis with stupid rocket emojis, which would make people take you less seriously.
