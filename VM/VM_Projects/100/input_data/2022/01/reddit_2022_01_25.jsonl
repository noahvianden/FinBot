The first pandemic wave was a good indication of demand at the time, but it's no guarantee for now. There are other metrics to see the current demand.\n\nWhat you don't seem to be taking into account is increasing EV demand though. This may be anecdotal, but a few years ago I knew almost nobody who wanted an EV (including myself), now I know very few people who don't want their next car to be an EV. On top of that we're seeing countries like Norway hit 100% EV sales this year, and countries like the UK, France, Germany, etc. are seeing steeper adoption curves than Norway did when they were at similar adoption levels. The demand is increasing extremely fast, and a huge amount of those people will end up buying a Tesla because it has the best specs, safety, software, charging, efficiency, etc. Especially as long as other OEMs are sticking to their incredibly low production targets of 1-3M per year by 2030.\n\nAlso, what can give you an idea of the future demand is looking at trends. For example Tesla grew production by ~90% last year, yet delivery times increased from ~3-6 weeks to up to 10 months for certain models. And that's including a $10K+ price increase. That's a very strong tell that demand is increasing.\n\n> What makes you think the extra cost can be easily cut without losses?\n\nThe fact that they were already making a lot of money before they increased their prices by $10-20K per model, and these price increases have largely not even affected Q3 earnings yet due to long order times. And in the meanwhile they've significantly cut back the production costs of their cars with things like single-piece casting of underbodies.\n\n> Scaling things up is difficult and expensive.

There are not enough high-end car buyers in the world to justify that. \n\nTSLA is now the #1 most expensive and overvalued stock in the market, at least I cannot find another others with such sky-high multiples.  Plus, they and Netflix are no longer the only big players in the sectors.  I can't think of a single major auto company that doesn't have or isn't coming out with a stylish EV, and all of them including Tesla also have supply chain shortages. \n\nAnecdotally, in the past four years I have lived in Brentwood LA and Miami Beach, both expensive car show-off neighborhoods.  Before other EV competitors crammed into the market, TSLA probably did have 300% growth in the California market. 4 years ago everyone wanted a TSLA and I saw them constantly, but a year later I saw many more new Audis and Mercedes and not so many Teslas.   I haven't seen more than 1 or 2 Teslas in Miami Beach, but dozens of Bentleys, Ferraris, Lamborghinis, tricked out trucks and SUV's etc. So a brand like Tesla can have a short term growth spurt in a certain market, but then tail off or drop off sharply as buyers' tastes and competition change.   \n\nBottomline, whatever growth spurts Tesla has had are in the past and the headwinds get stronger and stronger going forward.  Yes Tesla is a great company at a 30-40 PE but a a PE in the hundreds, forget it.  And you wonder why Musk has been dumping billions worth in shares. He knows.

They did $31.5B revenue in 2021. Even if Q4 is the same as Q3, which is highly unlikely as they sold 28% more cars (over a single quarter!), they'll be at $50B revenue for the full year 2021, or 59% growth.\n\nEverything else was as nonsensical as the misinformation I quoted above, so I'll just leave it at this.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Net income of 690 million, rather pathetic for a company valued at a trillion dollars.

If you annualize Q4 it'll be 76-91. If you consider the expected growth it'll be a forward PE of 60-70.\n\nThat puts them at a PEG ratio of around 1 (probably even lower, considering their earnings growth was much higher than their 70% revenue growth last year and will probably continue to be so for another 1-3 years).\n\nA PEG of under 1 for a company as innovative and with so much untapped TAM (energy, solar, robotaxis, AI, etc.) is really cheap.

The dollar amount of the move is exactly the same and all that matters.\n\nTaking a look now I’ve got a stock that’s around 70 a share and the days change was 17 cents, another stock that’s 10 a share and changed 19 cents. Moves bigger than that are rarer and my best earning stock by far trades under $6 and I’ve made more money off stocks in the $20 range than the $200 range. \n\nSo nah, once a stock hits a certain price point there’s other stocks to look at.  Market cap is irrelevant. I don’t need to buy those stocks.\n\nThe key is day to day change.  Find low value stocks that consistently climb up and you’ll do better than high value stocks that often have little place to go but down.  That’s provided the company fundamentals are good, of course.  \n\nBecause the thing is, the market isn’t rational. TSLA still isn’t a good buy imo. It’s not worth that a share to me.  Even dropping in value.  TSLA is a $60 stock in $800 clothes.  I’m never buying that stock.  Even with good fundamentals most high valued stocks are still over valued. Whereas low value stocks with good fundamentals are definitely under valued.  It’s easier to pick a little fish getting bigger, imo, then a whale that’s going to stay that big of a whale forever.  So I don’t bet on the companies that have already convinced everyone they’re good.  I look for cheaper stocks everyone ignores because if I buy low enough I’ll never be in the red on them. They’ll just probably never drop that low again. But Tesla can go lower, a lot lower.  Everybody focuses on big moves, which I think is a mistake.  The normal moves I’ve noticed are less than a dollar a share, regardless of share price.  So 1,000 shares moving up .67 cents is more money than 10 shares moving up .67 cents.  Pretty basic stuff.  Big moves happen, but they happen to all stocks too. Sometimes a 9 dollar stock jumps by 15 in a day.  I still made more money there with 100 of those than a single stock jumping 15 in a day.  \n\nAnd even if a big stock takes a leap, once, that a small stock doesn’t, say 200 in a day. Then stays around there the rest of the year, ok so I’m up 200.  But if 1,000 shares of a cheaper stock end up ahead 15 a share by the year end, I still made more money.  It’s just wiser to purchase at volume, imo.  And since I’m not Joe millionaire, I can’t buy Amazon in enough quantity to really make money off of it.  I get better returns off of Ford.  But even that’s not limited to big stocks, it’s rare, but anybody who owned GME before WSB took it for a ride definitely made a killing if they sold high because huge jumps can happen to any stock since again - the market ain’t rational.  But you can’t count on those big jumps in value.  They’re elusive.

The risk/reward of equities right now is more skewed towards risk than it's been in a while. So many things could go very wrong from here.

You can't explain this with interest rate hikes alone in my opinion, so assuming it's not irrational fear, it's most likely related to post-pandemic slowdown concerns.\n\nIt's possible SHOP has just been overvalued for years and AAPL was undervalued for years... And admittedly a good argument could be made there. But this divergence in valuation is interesting. It suggests that either historical valuations were mispriced, or that current valuations are.

Aggressive FED hiking + economic slowdown can take the market down much further. You need to keep in mind that even after all this selling the S&P500 still doesn't seem cheap. When sentiment turns this negative you generally need stocks to start looking relatively attractive from a valuation perspective to get investors to look passed their concerns.\n\nWhat worries me is that when I look at a company like AAPL I see a stock that could quite easily half if it misses earnings in 2022 in tandem to FED rate hikes. I'm not invested in AAPL but given it's weighting that should worry anyone in the market generally right now. A lot of tech is in a similar position too... A stock like NVDA is trading at a 2-3x higher valuation than it was just a few years ago... While I think fundamentally the overall market is fine, and that you could argue that stocks like AAPL or NVDA are worth their high valuations, when market sentiment is this negative it's probably not going to be enough for the market to just look reasonably valued.\n\nBack in 2018 when the FED announced rate hikes would be on autopilot the market panicked and the S&P500 dropped down to a very attractive valuation of about 19 PE. Today, even after all the selling this last month, we're trading at a 24.5 PE. So if this ends up like 2018 a 25% drop just on the S&P500 is potentially on the table, and that's assuming earnings hold up... The market needs some narrative to justify valuations, whether that's strong earnings or a dovish FED. Until we get one of those, I don't see how this ends.

Buying into an ecosystem just to make things easier either ends up costing a fortune or you end up screwed because they severely limit what you can do with the products they give you thus you end up endlessly trying to fit square pegs into round holes.

I will say Microsoft has been able to make a lot of great software such as their directory servers (Active Directory), mail servers (Exchange), and the Microsoft Office suite. Having said that, they fail at basic things like web servers and clustering technologies which are extremely slow, clunky, and not very resilient. Linux (which is free and has great community support) does these things very well. Microsoft has also tried their hand with hypervisors. I will say out of all of the hypervisors on the market Hyper-V is one of the crappiest. Microsoft doesn't even use it underneath their own Azure virtual infrastructure. Guess what they use? Linux. We use VMware. Microsoft has even added routing and switching functions on their Windows Servers at one point. Nobody I have ever met has ever used it. Everyone uses Cisco or Juniper.\n\nI saw someone say on here that Microsoft was a reanimated dinosaur. I'm sure they think IBM is still a dinosaur (30% of all days still reside in mainframes and most of the large financial institutions still have their mainframe applications that can't be moved off, they also own Red Hat). Surprisingly they probably have no idea that Apple is just as much of a dinosaur and was out of favor for pretty much the entire 80s and 90s as well as most of the 2000s.\n\nEven you are saying AutoCAD has become obsolete when it was once the market leader.

In Visual Studio for example, you can have full integration with SQL Server and visually query & design the database you're connected to. And doing any project that's hosted on IIS is significantly slower using VSCode because there's no integration at all.\n\n**tldr**: VSCode is near IDE for some languages (with extensions), other languages it still doesn't have as many features or the features aren't as powerful compared to full fledged IDEs that specialize in one language environment.", "score": 4, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "https://giphy.com/clips/erichamlet-developers-ballmer-gtm6yZur9eRFoo1UvO", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "If Google made a good OS I would use it", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "But how many of those products, besides LinkedIn, are good?

Hence the tapering and eventually selling off of the balance sheet and increasing rates to reduce lending. Currently, we are still at a net positive inflow of the money supply excluding current asset prices. The Fed wants to reach a negative outflow to reduce the velocity of money. Eventually a dollar will reach a HODL position, eg long term equities, bonds, real estate. However, if the cash inflow > HODL, then asset prices and inflation can still rise.
