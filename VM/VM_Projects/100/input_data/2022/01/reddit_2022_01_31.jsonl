A hedge lowers risk, which necessarily lowers reward.\n\nIf downturns and 30% drops in your portfolio cause you sleepless nights and anxiety, rotate the mix of your asset allocation to have a lower risk profile. Use more low volatility stock/funds, like USMV, use more bonds with shorter maturities, use more preferred shares, maybe get a basket of commodities ETP for inflation diversity.\n\nAs a side note, I hope your CN exposure is low and you are making it lower.

Like if you think there is a 12% chance of a 30%+ decline and a 25% chance of a 10-29% decline (average of 20%), you can spend (.12 x 30) + (.25 x 20) = 8.6% of your portfolio value on a hedge, assuming the hedge gains $1 for every $1 you lose during the downturn.

Always set a limit order for 50% profit. If I feel like selling before that's ok. The rationale here is because all the time I pick my contracts, I saw it going really well, some over 200%, but I got greedy and I couldn't take any of these profits.\n2. Only buy calls to companies I see growth for over the past 10 years. My favorite picks right now are SPY (mainly), MSFT, and APPL. (We can't predict the future with the past but it is still a good reference - I will always keep reading the news and earnings to stop with a specific company if I feel like to)\n3. Only buy slightly OTM contracts, preferably ATM.\n4. Only get into contracts with more than 6 months to expiration, so if a bear market happens right away I still have time to recover.\n\nI know this strategy has flaws like not having a stop loss, this is something I want to refine after by observing how it is going, but does someone know if there is any known strategy that looks like this so I can read more?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "The strategy is pretty standard for long calls, so any book or article on long calls should cover it. You should also have a loss limit you will exit at. You don't need to set up an order to handle it automatically, you can instead monitor alerts and decide if you should bail out or roll. If you set a 25% loss exit, you will have a pretty nice 34% win rate to break even. You should be able to beat 34% as a long term average with good stock selection and AAPL (not APPL), MSFT and SPY are about as blue chip as you can get.\n\n\nThe one thing that is a little non-standard is your expiration selection. 6+ months is an awkward time. Expirations only go out 3 to 4 months from the current month and then skip months until you hit a quarterly. You also pay a premium for low volume/low liquidity and all that additional expiration time, but I'm not sure that premium is rewarded. You accumulate a lot of theta decay, that's for sure.\n\nSo here is an alternative that achieves the same goal. You say you want a far expiration to give yourself enough time to recover, but what if the decline happens in the last month? You are no better off than if you had done a more liquid 1 month call. In fact, you are worse off, because you had a lot of opportunity cost and accumulated theta. Instead, use 60 days to expiration and roll every 30 days. If a decline happens, you only lose 60 days worth of capital max, instead of 6+ months worth of capital. Then you buy the dip and probably make back what you lost and more.

That equation is only true at expiration. I'm going to leave out the multiplier and leave everything in per share values, it's easier that way. Before expiration:\n\nIF AND ONLY IF stock p > strike p: payoff = (stock p - strike p) + extrinsic value - cost basis.\n\nIf stock p <= strike p: payoff = extrinsic value - cost basis.

Screenshot?\n\n> Is it correct to assume that deep OTM options have far greater leverage effect if things go the right way with everything is held constant?\n\nLeverage is a function of cost basis vs. potential gains/losses, so the less you pay up front, the more leverage you get, for constant gain/loss. Since OTM contracts generally cost less than ITM, they give more leverage.\n\n> The risk is greater, but the reward is also greater?\n\nProbability of loss is greater, but size of loss is smaller. Risk is both probability and size.\n\nAlso, reward may only be greater on a % basis, not necessarily a $ basis. Consider an ITM call that costs $1.00 vs. a far OTM call that costs $.01. If the ITM call goes up to $1.01 in value, that's only a 1% gain, but if the OTM call goes up to $.02 in value, that's a 100% gain, even though both calls only went up $.01 in value.\n\n\n> To achieve greater leverage effect, one has to buy a call deep ITM with a super low IV and a super low ask price.

So one should buy more cheaper OTM options to even match the ITM options values with the potential gain in $ basis? In plain English, if one wants to earn a lot of $, he doesn't necessarily have to buy high leveraged cheap OTM options.

I realize that normally I'd just want to sell the contract).\n\n\\- Current value is $9.75 on an apparently massive ER miss (guidance was pessimistic). I went over some 3rd party analysis and while I feel that the concerns are overblown, the fact of the matter is I'm down 80% so for the experiment I am proceeding as if my original thesis IS wrong.\n\n\\- With this much time left, I feel that the best option is NOT to cut my losses as I'm throwing away roughly 90% of the theta I paid for. That being said, what would be the best move to make at this point? Another diagonal calendar spread at this range is obviously picking up pennies in front of a steamroller, but if I keep lowering my cost basis I could perhaps reach B/E sooner and sell the contract/exit the position (again, I consider the play a failure as market sentiment has proven that my thesis was incorrect) on some positive price action. Also, I do have a good amount of time to roll out, but my runway is finite so the fear is pinning myself into an assignment at a loss.\n\n\\- My first thought was just doing [the repair strategy](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/08/repair-strategy.asp), but given the market reaction, this could easily just be throwing money at bad money.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "The one thing you have going for you is time.

And with GOOG being super volatile today, volatility skew is to be expected.\n\nAlso, while we are on the subject of GOOG, it's best to avoid underlyings that have announced a split or other corporate action until the effective date is known, otherwise you run the risk of being dead-ended with non-standard contracts. Splits are the least risky of all corporate actions, since post-split non-standards tend to have decent liquidity if the option chain was already liquid, but as a general rule, avoid.

It's less risky and all. Sure, if the stock doesn't go the desired way, you can still sell for that high intrinsic value and maybe exercise to hold the stock.\n\nBut I think the opposite. We should buy far deep OTM LEAPS.\n\n1. It doesn't matter, if the stock price after say 1 year still doesn't exceed the strike price. But the stock price tends to go up a lot. We can still make tons of money by selling to close before expiration. So the option does not have to be ITM to be profitable. Right or dumb?\n2. Deep OTM LEAPS leverage is heck a lot higher, which is good. I like the high leverage effect here.\n3. Deep OTM LEAPS is very cheap and therefore we can buy a lot for the same amount of $\n4. The only downside I can think of is, when the stock price doesn't rise a lot in %, there is no intrinsic value and only a little bit of extrinsic value left. So deep OTM LEAPS are only great for stocks with high upside potential. So the extrinsic value needs to outperformance its theta decay rate. To my understanding, the theta rate for deep OTM is always smaller than ATM LEAPS. Therefore, I don't need that poor intrinsic value, if I think the stock has one year of time to performance 50%, the LEAPS would do 500% and more. Why buy an ITM LEAPS, if we bet on the future growth of a stock anyway?\n5. Sure, LEAPS expires and stocks don't. But think about the high leverage! It's a risky gamble, but the reward is just too great.\n6. Delta can work against me. But when I'm right, damn, the OTM can easily outperform the cripple ITM by tenfold. \n\nAm I crazy or is this reasonable?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "You are halfway to the right answer. I'll explain the other half in a minute, but you don't address theta decay in your analysis, so you missed that. You are going to have a ton of theta decay, both in $ and in %, on the OTM call.\n\nFor example, compare an ITM call with $1.00 of time value (total premium of $20.00) and 365 DTE to an OTM call with $3.00 of time value and 365 DTE. Even if they have the same small amount of theta, like .01, after less than 300 days you can only lose $1 for the ITM call, but you lose $3 for the OTM call. So the $ loss is clearly higher for the OTM call. As a percentage, you only lose $1 out of $20 for the ITM call, so 5%, but for the OTM call you lose 100% of value to theta.\n\nSecondly, while you mentioned delta, I don't think you gave it enough credit. A delta of 15 is going to have puny gains vs. a delta of 85, for the same $1 of underlying price movement. You may have to wait a very long time indeed to achieve your $ profit exit target. Sure, you can be happy with your leverage and % gain, but if you paid $.01 and now have $.02, celebrating your 100% gain doesn't seem quite so awesome, since you only earned $1.\n\nNow, to the half you are missing. It's has nothing to do with OTM vs. ITM, it has to do with holding time. The comparison should not be ITM LEAPS call vs. OTM LEAPS call. It should be ITM LEAPS call with 1 year of holding time to a series of rolled OTM calls with only 30 days of holding time opened at 60 DTE, or 45 days of holding time opened at 90 DTE. By planning to roll during the less onerous part of the theta decay curve, you may reduce your cumulative loss to theta, despite having a higher rate of theta compared to the ITM LEAPS call.\n\nOther advantages of rolling:\n\n* Take profits sooner\n\n* Take losses sooner (for tax loss harvesting)\n\n* Adjust your strike selection according to market conditions and the price trend of the underlying. The probability is higher for a decision turning out to be correct if you made it 30 days ago than if you made it a year ago.\n\n* Calls cost less when they are closer to expiration, so higher leverage.\n\n* If your goal is to own shares, you get them much sooner instead of waiting a year or more.\n\nDisadvantages:\n\n* Tax drag. Total tax might be higher for the rolling strategy vs. just holding one OTM call for a year.\n\n* More maintenance hassle. A 1 year hold is fire-and-forget, the rolling strategy requires action every 4 to 6 weeks.\n\n* If you roll losers time after time, that can be more psychologically demoralizing than just seeing your 1 year call sit in the red for most of a year. However, on the bright side, you can give up on the whole idea sooner and find something else to spend your money on. Actually, you can do that with a LEAPS call as well, but psychologically people are reluctant to do that, since they paid for the extra runway with a higher initial debit, basically a sunk cost fallacy.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "u/PapaCharlie9 Thank you for your well-structured thoughts!\n\nSomehow, I find that you hate the idea of OTM LEAPS :)\n\n1.

Sure, the far deep OTM has the highest Theta rate, but its extrinsic value is not the highest. so it's not so easy to tell.\n2. Delta, right, small delta produces teeny tiny gain. On a single option transaction basis, the ITM will always outperform the OTM with the same expiration date. I get that. But the beauty with OTM is that it's super cheap, so you would end up buying way more with the same budget.

What kind of rolling OTM is that? Slightly OTM calls?\n2. How exactly do you roll them? Sell to close one position and buy to open another after 60 days?\n3.

I hate the idea of long holding times for options. If you want to hold for a year or more, buy shares. Shares have the advantage of no expiration, no time decay, 100% delta, and pay dividends when the options don't.\n\nIf you want leverage, use shorter holding times.\n\n> Theta, an ATM option has the maximum of extrinsic value or slightly ITM, not deep OTM.\n\nThat is not factually correct. OTM is 100% extrinsic value by definition. ATM swaps between 100% and something less than 100% as it goes from OTM to ITM and back again.\n\n> This type of options loses theta the fastest.\n\nIf you mean theta is highest ATM, with respect only to moneyness, that is usually true. But that is not the same thing as 100% extrinsic value, you are mistaken about that.\n\n> What kind of rolling OTM is that? Slightly OTM calls?\n\nIf you like. It really doesn't matter. You can roll deep ITM calls if you want. It all depends on how much leverage vs. delta you want.\n\n> How exactly do you roll them? Sell to close one position and buy to open another after 60 days?\n\nI literally use a [roll order](https://www.tradestation.com/insights/2020/12/23/rolling-options-key-things-for-traders-to-know/). For example, my first position is opened at 60 DTE, say on January 21 I open a call that expires on March 18. On February 18 I roll that call out to April 15. That means that 30 days into the 60 DTE expiration I roll to a new 60 DTE position. A roll closes the old position and opens the new position in a single order, realizing a gain/loss on the old position.\n\n> Total cost of a series of rolling OTM calls compared to OTM or ITM LEAPS?\n\nThat is up to you. You control how much the cost of the roll is. If you want the sum of 12 rolls to always be less than the cost of a single LEAPS call, you can do that. If you want it to always be the same delta regardless of cost, you can do that instead.\n\nFor me, because IV has been increasing, the cost of 12 rolls has totaled to more than the corresponding LEAPS call after 1 year. But that's because I've used constant delta regardless of cost.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I didn’t formulate clearly. \nI believe, ATM options have the highest extrinsic value and no intrinsic value, because strike p = stock price. \n\nI totally get your point about long holding time.

In the first instance, I would think that you always lose money because the rolled call can’t make up the loss of the previous rolled call.

It’s easier for you to identify the magnitude so you can adjust your position more easily. \n\nWhat I was trying to say is that if you cook a crab slowly with low heat it doesn’t know it’s dying.

So it really doesn't matter. You don't want to be rolling and you don't want to be holding a single call for a year.\n\nHowever, lets say that the declines are a lot shorter than the holding time, like only 2 to 3 weeks.

For a 1 year hold, you don't benefit from the dip at all since your cost basis won't change.\n\n\n> If the market tanks by say 40%, ok, you just lose your premium. \n\nYou lose the premium of a 60 to 90 day call, which is a lot less than a 365+ day call.

Isnt he already in Profit?\n\nFirst, let's review what extrinsic value is.\n\nContract premium = intrinsic value + extrinsic value\n\nIntrinsic value is 0 if the contract is OTM.\n\nIf the contract is ITM, intrinsic value = stock price - strike price for a call, strike price - stock price for a put.\n\nExtrinsic value is also called \"time value\". It's the risk premium that sellers demand for taking on the risk of fulfilling the contract at a specified time. The more time to expiration, the higher the risk to the seller, thus the higher the risk premium.\n\nIn your scenario where ROKU went below $85, if there are still many days/weeks to expiration, there is still risk through time. Thus, sellers of that put will demand time value (extrinsic value) above and beyond intrinsic value.\n\nLet's say ROKU goes to $84. This means the intrinsic value of the put is $1. But what is the put actually worth? If you look up the quote you are likely to see a larger number for the total premium of the put. It might be $1.69. It might be $2.36. It could even be $11.27. Whatever value the contract has above $1 intrinsic value is extrinsic value.\n\nSo, recall that exercising *throws away extrinsic value*. If you exercise that put right now, you get $1/share. But if the put itself was worth $1.69, you just threw away $.69/share. If it was worth $2.36, you threw away $1.36/share. If it was worth $11.27, you just threw away $10.27/share.\n\nNow, how likely is it for someone to decide they will throw away each of those amounts of money?

I would only do it when volatility is low or you expect it to be low or if volatility is high and you have a itch or premium's just too good, then never sell more than a week out. Here's the reason:\n\nI sold some 100 strike CSPs expiring 2/4 on January 19 when AMD was at 130, for 50 cent premium. The following few weeks was massacre for AMD so to speak where it dropped day after day until it reached \\~99.60 early morning last Thursday. The premium had shot up from 50 cents to around 5 dollars. \n\nHere's the first lesson - although I don't mind owning AMD at 100, even if assigned, if the stock price approaches your strike price quickly way before expiration, the premium becomes really juicy. If I was willing to take AMD at 100, it would have been even better to collect 3-4 dollars / contract of premium instead of 50 cents / contract, with even less time premium. Had I just sold weeklies, first batch expiring Jan 28, then selling another batch for this week last Friday, the premium collected would have been way better. \n\nThe second lesson is that when you sell CSPs, you no longer can buy the stock even if the stock fell to a price point you want to enter i.e. 100, unless you are willing to take on margin AND assignment risk. When AMD fell below 100, I didn't want to take the risk of buying at that point, because of the very real risk that my CSPs will be assigned and push me into margin. During this volatile period, anything can happen and I've been burned before with margin calls. Had I not have CSPs, I could have used 1/4 of my cash and bought in at 100 and enjoy the 15% gain since, and if it had fallen further, I have more cash to deploy. \n\nOnce you write a CSP, you can miss out on your buy point, because it can reach your strike price and under, then make a quick recovery to way over your strike price at expiry. \n\nIn this environment, my advice would simply to wait for an opportunity to buy rather than using CSPs in lieu of limit order, unless the premium is so good for the strike and the duration till expiry.\n\nHopefully this is not too confusing.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "A bit confusing, but I think I get it.

This passive indexing has been a winning strategy to successfully build wealth with minimum effort for the past 100 years. \r  \n\r  \nEvery investor's long-term investment success depends more on asset allocation than any other single factor.  So congratulations, you are on the right track.  VWRL is a  well-diversified global ETF and any low-cost S&P 500 fund is effective as well.  Since the total U.S. market includes 20% mid-cap and 10% small-cap stocks, you might consider including some VB in your portfolio to cover the full spectrum of company sizes.\r  \n\r  \nYour question about how to properly overweight individual company stocks in your overall portfolio really boils down to optimum diversification to minimize risk (avoid losses) and maximize gains (build wealth).  Constructive diversification means reducing risk but not diluting winning investments with chronic losers.  Although the 4 individual stocks that comprise 55% of your portfolio have all done quite well over the past few years, I would still not recommend more than 5% of any single company stock.  \r  \n\r  \nSo, I am not suggesting that you throw more money at individual big tech stocks because they are more volatile than ETFs.  Spread your investments over time and over different assets to minimize risk and maximize long-term gains.  Shy away from all or nothing bets.  \r  \n\r  \nIf you liked this comment, please upvote and help me build more Karma.  Thanks.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for the advice!

{"title": "Sony to buy videogame developer Bungie in $3.6 billion deal", "selftext": "\nText from Bloomberg article:\n\nSony Group Corp. is purchasing Bungie Inc., the U.S. video game developer behind the popular Destiny franchise, for $3.6 billion to bolster its stable of game-making studios. \n\nThe deal announced on Monday is the third significant video-game acquisition announced this month, following Microsoft Corp.’s purchase of Activision Blizzard for $69 billion two weeks ago and Take Two Interactive Corp. snagging mobile game leader Zynga Inc. on Jan. 10. Buying Bungie will give Sony one of the most popular first-person shooter games to compete with the massive Call of Duty series, which Sony’s main rival now owns through Activision.\n\nMicrosoft is committed to releasing at least the next three Call of Duty games on Sony’s PlayStation, Bloomberg News has reported. But eventually Microsoft could decide to take the series exclusively to its Xbox console and Windows computers, and Sony may see Destiny as its response.\n\nSony is a regular acquirer of video game studios, though Bungie is by far its largest of the past decade. The Japanese entertainment and technology giant typically buys less established studios and enhances them with marketing and development resources, as it did for Naughty Dog and Guerrilla Games. Sony also holds minority stakes in some bigger game companies, such as Epic Games Inc., the maker of Fortnite. In recent years, Sony has made some smaller acquisitions, notably Burbank, California-based Insomniac Games in 2019 and Finland’s Housemarque, aiming to bolster its library of PlayStation exclusives. \n\nWhile Microsoft has focused on packing its subscription service, Xbox Game Pass, full of games big and small, Sony’s blueprint is to develop large blockbusters and keeping them exclusive to PlayStation -- a strategy that helped the PlayStation 4 sell more than 116 million units, well ahead of the Xbox.\n\nBellevue, Washington-based Bungie, founded in 1991, helped put the Xbox on the map with the Halo franchise and was purchased by Microsoft in 2000. In 2007, the studio negotiated its independence and spun out from Microsoft to work on its next big thing, Destiny, with Activision. That relationship ended in 2019 and Bungie began self-publishing and operating Destiny independently.\n\nDestiny functions differently than many other franchises. Rather than release a regular cadence of sequels, Bungie decided to continue operating and expanding the most recent game, Destiny 2. The base game is free-to-play, while Bungie regularly releases expansions and season passes full of new content. The move has been popular, drawing in more than 20 million players since 2019, according to Bungie.\n\n\nBloomberg Article:\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-31/sony-buys-destiny-developer-bungie-for-3-6-billion\n\n\nOther Links:\n\nPlayStation Blog: https://blog.playstation.com/2022/01/31/bungie-is-joining-playstation/\n\nBungie.Net: https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/50988\n\nCNBC: https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/31/sony-to-buy-video-game-maker-bungie-in-3point6-billion-deal.html?__source=iosappshare%7Ccom.apple.UIKit.activity.CopyToPasteboard\n\nIGN: https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-sony-buys-bungie\n\nBusinesswire: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220131005684/en/Sony-Interactive-Entertainment-to-Acquire-Leading-Independent-Videogame-Developer-Bungie\n\nGamespot: https://www.gamespot.com/amp-articles/sony-buys-bungie-for-3-6-billion/1100-6500122/?utm_source=reddit.com\n\nKotaku: https://kotaku.com/sony-ps5-destiny-2-bungie-playstation-microsoft-xbox-ex-1848453326\n\nTheVerge: https://www.theverge.com/22910846/sony-bungie-acquisition-playstation-destiny-halo\n\nPolygon: https://www.polygon.com/22910849/sony-buys-bungie-destiny-2-multiplatform-playstation", "id": "sh88j5", "created_utc": 1643653669.0, "score": 1824, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 407, "comments": [{"body": "Did I mention I have a video game company named Buymi?

I have been arguing with some people on Twitter, and I thought this case study might help make illustrate some points regarding unions/free-markets.\n\nThe proposition of music artists is that \"record labels exploit artists through unfair contracts\". I have heard this for a long time. The word exploit (in this context) means, \"make use of (a situation) in a way considered unfair or underhand.\" People think artists deserve more money. They think that the 'execs' are making money off the backs of the 'working people'.\n\nThe common form of this logic is basically \"X profession is underpaid by the market\". The problem with this logic is that how do you know when someone is underpaid? There is no ground truth. The market is an agglomeration of all market participants. It is by definition, the most 'free' and 'fair'. Do you not think musicians would think that they are underpaid? Of course they do. Everyone thinks they are underpaid. It's a natural conclusion from our human biases.\n\nThis is basically what a union is designed to 'counter'. It is a sub-grouping of people who form a single negotiating block, to increase their ability to extract resources from the larger grouping of people. The issue with unions is that everyone can form a union. It just becomes a battle of 'unions' rather than a battle of 'companies'. There is no difference. It's just an attempt to transfer power from person X to Y.\n\nThe point of capitalism is that you provide your services to the market, and let the market decide what it is worth. Unions are the opposite, it is using your specific ingroup power to arbitrarily set prices. They are just ways for subgroups to exert more power vs the population. Ironically the structure/behaviour of unions is exactly that which they criticise in capitalism. It's hypocrisy at its finest. Unions by definition are exploiting anyone who isn't part of that union. \"That is unfair because the money is not in my pocket\".\n\nThe moral of the story is this: stop fucking complaining about the market. If you don't like it, go and change it. But, changing it via activism isn't productive. Changing it via business processes/innovation is. If you can't change it via the latter, then maybe it shouldn't be changed.
