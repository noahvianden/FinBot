Chip manufacturing is so complicated it's pretty consolidated into 2 main manufacturers and that's very unlikely to change.

The time tail of modern chip technology is long. And then there's the money aspect of it you have to risk. Which is billions to build a factory. TSMC has been the dominant one for some time but the risks they have taken with investing into new technologies are just crazy.\n\nIndia tried I think they are now manufacturing some low grade chips. It's just impossible to jump into the cutting edge race. There use to be more manufacturers in there but they all went for lower risk larger size architecture.\n\nChina is trying as well but pretty unlikely they are going to be manufacturing cutting edge chips within 10 years.\n\nThe EUV technology is crazy. Drop molten metal and shoot it mid flight with lasers to produce the desired rays. Developing that alone is probably 10 years if you can't steal the plans from whatever company in europe makes them. Like China with the F-35's. Already too complicated to just make based on the plans alone. Technology trail is long.

{"title": "Student loans might cause the next crash", "selftext": "I have changed my opinon on this post and have made a [new post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ruaoux/student_loans_will_not_cause_the_next_crash/)\n\nTL;DR: Student loans are getting out of control and the average American is struggling to pay back. Once Biden's student loan pause stops the debt market might spiral out of control.\n\nOkay ill make my thesis pretty clear from the start:Americans aren't able to pay their student loans back.\n\nA pretty simple thesis right? In my opinion, yes, it's a lot simpler than mortgages.\n\nThe subprime mortgage crash of 2008 was caused by, in short terms, people not being able to afford paying their mortgages after their teaser rates expired.Theres a myriad of other ways to explain it and  thats just what I think. People were getting loans they obviously couldn't pay.They ignored the rates in the long term because they were being blinded with the misconceptions that they could always refinance their terms. This was obviously wrong, but the issuers didn't give a shit, because it made them rich. So they kept on dishing out loans to people even with shitty credit scores.\n\nThis time however Americas debt problems have taken a different turn. The student loan market is very different from the mortgage market. Obviously the market is smaller, but student loans are still the second largest consumer debt with a market of 1.6 trillion USD. The crazy thing is that the average debt incurred by students to fund their seminary education is $33,000. While the student loans cause less debt than mortgages they also often have worse terms. Issuers tend to focus on the principal amount owed while ignoring the interest that accumulates. This can really mess some people up when  in their later years of college they realise that they might need to take an extra semester to pass. Student debt can also set a stopper on getting a mortgage. If you spend say 10 or 15% on your student debt, getting a mortgage where you pay say 35% can be impossible. Student debt is also harder to refinance as fewer private issuers include refinancing in their terms, and with federal loans it forfeits key consumer protections.If you go bankrupt you cant discharge your loan without proving that your issuer is causing you \"undue hardship\". In mortgages all of these things are much easier to do and the debt market is obviously much more regulated.\n\nSo far I have only talked about how student loans are rigged against the average American. However one of the most pressing issues are the unjust rising costs of college. Ill let this chart speak for itself: [https://i.huffpost.com/gen/1192706/images/o-COLLEGE-COSTS-facebook.jpg](https://i.huffpost.com/gen/1192706/images/o-COLLEGE-COSTS-facebook.jpg)\n\nBiden recently extended the Student debt forgiveness act. This is obviously bearish. This can be compared to the teaser rates running out and people not being able to afford their payments. As people haven't had to pay student loans in a while now, it is fair to say the part of their income that went to student debt has gone to other things. Maybe restaurants, maybe a new car with more debt etc... This basically means that people are going to be struggling to find money to repay their loans with.\n\nSo, how can we profit off of this? I would say credit default swaps. However i dont really know the credit derivatives market well and maybe someone in the comments has a better idea?\n\nI dont really know how this is going to play out on the markets.

There's nothing center about forcing people to choose to lose their jobs, there's nothing center about shutting down any opposing conversations on any topic. I myself have been banned from 2 large groups for saying I got vaccinated twice but didn't want to get a 3rd shot. It made me realize that the discontent for the current left is far greater than you and I can see because most social media have become echo chambers thanks to not allowing any moderate opposition. I can understand banning crazy qanon 5g talk, but one of the groups that banned me for saying I didn't think a 3rd shot would be beneficial to me was a stock market sub. There is no \"center\" appeal from the left, it's a hard left promoting aggressive barking at anything that doesn't align with them. \"Eat the rich\" means all the poor people hate anyone that has more than them, not just Elon Musk, but even other people close to the poverty line who happen to have more. \"Punch a nazi\" means it's ok to threaten or intimidate anyone that disagrees with you, not actual white supremacists, for example calling Larry Elder or Candace Owens white supremacists; they are just conservatives. People on the left want free college, free healthcare, free child care, all kinds of food stamps and welfare, extra money for having children, free school lunches for all of them, yet there's zero talk about sensible and sustainable family planning. If someone is unable to take care of a hamster for 8 years, they shouldn't have 5 kids and 3 dogs while also unable to hold a job for more than a year.

This means they don't have to actually approve their loan for a specific field of study they know will increase the odds of the loan being paid back as agreed. If you make loans bankruptable, then loan companies will be more likely to start screening which fields of study and even perhaps what kinds of people get these loans.

As such, CDS and other derivatives insurance bets are moreso in play, regarding this situation.\n\nAlso, your assertion that all student loans are backed by the federal government is woefully inaccurate. Sallie Mae, the main private lender for student loans, is not backed by the federal government. The U.S. has been unwinding its exposure to bad student loan debt for years.

The main purpose is so that the money from the value in houses is flowing in the economy back to the people to further additional growth.\n\nWhere does this exist in student loans, how could it possibly cause a crash outside of a lender relying on cash flow from student loans to fund external bonds and securities. \n\nMaybe the value of some securities takes a hit? It is a much smaller thing than the Mortgage market which is at least twice the value of the student loan market. It really depends on where the money is coming from, if most students are taking their loans from the federal government, well the government will print more money when they are unable to receive more money from the student loan payback which is what is happening now. The value of the dollar decreases and inflation goes on. The only thing that could happen would be continued printing of money and inflation causing the dollar to continue to tank and therefore continually inflation the cost of hard assets (property, stocks, securities, etc.).\n\nWhat do student loans actually do? Well student loans are taken out and the idea is that after graduating the student acquires a position from an employer which pays them sufficiently to funnel that money back to their lender. So the issue then is that the students are not finding positions after graduating which prevents the flow of cash from employers in America back into the hands of the lenders that allowed for the student loans to come out. \n\nSo what, it means there is a higher rate of unemployment amongst certain students which therefore drives the value of certain degrees and educational institutions which allow for employment at a higher rate and allows them to continue to charge the same if not higher rates for their services because they are allowing for successful repayment. The institutions that are finding their students are not successful will find their student numbers dwindle and close down which is good for America because there are too many for profit diploma mills that are taking advantage of the system.\n\nThe only risk is if certain lenders go under due to a lack of cash flow from student loan repayment but hopefully the leadership running those firms would be smart enough to at least ensure that they are minimizing risk with a diverse portfolio of accounts receivable rather than putting too much into one basket.\n\nThe issue in 2008 caused bailouts of Fannie/Freddie because those institutions wer ONLY in the mortgage market, as far as i know outside of maybe whatever federal aid program exists there are no major financial institutions where a majority of their lended income goes towards student loans.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "What year is it?  \n\nThey have been saying this stuff since about 2008.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Im with this 100%.

As of today the \"1 year\" and \"all time\" charts will say different things, so *that* is a muscle memory thing I need to unlearn..\n\nTop of the line: up 35.66% percent this year\n\nNot only is this like 8% higher than SPY, based on the way Robinhood handles total return graphs this is actually understating it due to the fact that I added money during the year. If I deposited my entire account balance tonight said percentage performance would be cut in half since it assumes all deposited cash increases the initial cost basis.\n\nMax drawdown: 12% (still haven't fully recovered)\n\nMeasured from my account's ATH in November to the trough in.... well later November. RIP meme stocks. At least we stopped the bleeding.\n\n\nHoldings types:\n\nEven though I call it my \"options account\" about 1/3rd of it is in various ETFs (and a microscopic amount of BRK.A) that I'm not using as collateral for options plays. This is the money I had earned from political betting on PredictIt, plus whatever I decide to throw in every once in a while. This is segregated a bit, as I literally haven't rebalanced at all and don't consider selling these ETFs for more theta gang plays.\n\nThe options portion is funded entirely through stimulus checks, tax refunds, and the realized gains from options trades. This is to reduce stress in case I fuck up because why panic sell if it's \"fun money\"?\n\nGeneral strategies:\n\nI did a little bit of everything theta gang related. Debit spreads, credit spreads, wheeling with covered calls and selling puts, diagonal spreads with deep in the money calls to simulate a covered call with leverage, doing the same to simulate selling a put with leverage, etc. Somehow managed to control positions in a way so I could keep rolling for a realized gain rather than be forced to realize a loss (without being stupid and rolling out 2 months for a 5 cent net credit).\n\nFavorite positions:\n\nWheel trading AMC and BlackBerry. No leverage, just selling puts and making money until you're assigned then selling covered calls until you're assigned. Being meme stocks, I could afford to have stupid timing and make money.\n\nLeast favorite positions:\n\nBuying Ford and Nokia LEAPS with 3 to 1 and 6 to 1 leverage to sell covered calls against right before they both trended down. Yeah... not fun. Haven't worried about a position that hard since. The sweet spot is clearly 2 to 1. Less extrinsic value that way.\n\nTaxes:\n\nMy taxable gains is slightly higher than the amount I'm up due to unrealized losses. Let's hope I didn't violate the wash sale rule. And I can just import my 20 page 1099.\n\nPayment for order flow:\n\nAccording to regulatory filings, Robinhood makes 60 cents in revenue for each options contract traded. So I generated approximately $530 in payment for order flow revenue for them, more than probably any other financial thing besides my car lease. This is based on the trades I've already done and the inevitable closing of contracts I currently have.\n\nTargets for next year:\n\nUse less leverage, don't sell weekly stock options (for various reasons), and buy more LEAPS debit spreads that just need the underlying to not plummet 9 months to a year from now in order to make money while reducing reliance on meme stocks.\n\nAll around a good year. I have no idea if these returns are sustainable absent of a strong bull market or a market full of meme stocks with a much higher implied volatility than realized volatility to take advantage of in options pricing. But since I'm taking advantage of theta decay for almost all of these strategies, I am far less likely to be BTFO'd than if i bought ATM LEAPS if markets go down or sideways. \n\nBut yeah, I'm tempting fate if I go as far to say this literally can't go tits up lmao.\n\n***Disclaimer: options trading is a speculative investment. It includes market risk, liquidity risk, volatility risk, and getting screwed for reasons you didn't think of risk. Ask a financial advisor if options trading on Robinhood is right for you, and fire them if they say it is. You should not be doing this under most circumstances. I shouldn't either, but it's too late for that. Buy SPY, QQQ, and/or VTI before it's too late, I am warning you.***\n\n***Please read the prospectus before considering investing.
