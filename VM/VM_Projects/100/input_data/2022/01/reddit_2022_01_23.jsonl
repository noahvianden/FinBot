While I believe in the company and am a client of theirs, I don't see them monetizing their position. And where do you grow when you already serve 80% of the market?\n\nSure, they can start to abuse their position like google sometimes starts to aggressively monetize one service or another, but that will also disrupt their positions in the market.\n\n## Nvidia (NVDA)\n\nThe company is sound, I have no doubt about them making money. But if I compare their market cap with the actual financials, it seems like they're still overvalued like 5 times. I'd believe a two times growth, but that's it. There's just not that much business in what they do, unless some competitor goes out.\n\nNot a buy at this price.\n\n## Coinbase (COIN)\n\nI've seen this trending lately. Obviously their revenue and profits are great, probably one of the best financials-to-price ratios on the market at the moment. For about six months since the IPO I was planning to buy it if the price hits $200 and now it has.\n\nAnd I am sure they will do great on Q4 of 2021 and Q1 of 2022. The prices of cyptocurrencies are falling, there's a lot of market activity and that's exactly their business.\n\nIf the market of cryptocurrencies crashes completely, they are out. Or they can get regulated out.\n\nSo, they've fallen down to my target price and they're going to make a lot of money. Why haven't I bought yet? Because at this point I give more than 50% that their business niche will stop existing within 5 years.\n\n## Corsair Gaming (CRSR)\n\nAnother company that has been occasionally hyped on reddit, because it's gaming. But they make fine products and quite a variety of them. They have good positions in the market but a place to grow as well. And once you look at their revenue, profits, assets, it seems nearly impossible that the price might drop another 50%. At most 30% of the current price is made out of hope.\n\nThis seems the safest buy out of these four.

I have formal economics training. and I watched the whole video you linked. My thoughts:\n\nIf he does have formal economics training, he's being straight disingenuous or like my initial post says, has a deep misunderstanding/misapplicatoin of macroecon. Here is why.\n\nThe Fed considers the economy close to/or heading very quickly towards Max Employment. Kevin here seems to think that the fed wants to prioritize ethnic/marginalized group employment. This is a nice to have and is not a priority, unlike the actual mandates the Fed is beholden to, ie. monitor inflation, and monitor employment. These \"Dual Mandates\" are what they steer policy around. With one mandate met, the Fed is free to go ham on interest rates. Has inflation been caused mostly by supply chain issues? Sure, it has, which we in econ call demand-pull inflation, ie. too many people chasing too few available goods. He addresses this briefly, in line with common knowledge that supply chains are an issue but not exactly in economics terms. But the street knew the Fed was behind the curve with the transitory call. The problem is this, we now face labour shortages (again, because the labor market is strong, unlike what Kevin seems to think here). These higher wages across many levels of the economy will start, and to some degree have already translated into, something called cost-push inflation. This is where the Fed will be watching to see if there are sources of inflation beyond supply issues, which we all know will taper down a bit. So, to bring it back to Kevin thinking this is short term bullish, I ask why? When the Street is starting to take into account cost push inflation as a factor with a Fed that likes to wait and see when the data comes out (which in an academically diverse group of Fed members like the current makeup makes sense), but creates a situation where they again might be behind the curve. This is creating a situation where policy error is heightened, and they may have to oversteer. On top of that, we know they are already behind the curve since they announced not only a neutral Balance sheet stance, but in fact are taking money out of the system with tapering, the opposite of QE. This double whammy of policy moves from an economic standpoint is quite literally meant to slow down the economy. The risk is to the downside that they continue to clamp down, with fears of an oversteering which might cause a recession. Recession signals are already flashing, with yields starting to move and the curve starting to flatten, on top of projections of 2%+ 10yr. Will there be a recession? Maybe, maybe not. Could there be a bottom soon if the Fed on Wednesday come out a bit more dovish? Sure. But ultimately my point is this. Meet Kevin just reads data and acts as if that's a forward looking projection. It is not, and to come out and say that what the fed said is \"Mega Bullish\" is straight up misleading on so many levels, and even worse still if he has formal economics training. He should know that none of this is looking short term bullish. And the market seems to think the same as we've recently seen. The trend is your friend and don't fight the Fed.

Even when autonomous vehicles are fully deployed, Tesla will continue to work to make them even better and safer. I believe Elon has mentioned that at some time in the future he would like autonomous Teslas to drive at least as well as the best human drivers.\n\nThe threshold Tesla talks about most often is the point at which autonomous Teslas are good enough that fully deploying them (not just as a beta) would result in a significant reduction in number of crashes, injuries, and deaths (that's where the comparison to average drivers is relevant). At that point in time it makes sense to fully deploy them, because to delay deployment further actually results in more crashes, injuries, and deaths than deploying them. In practical terms Tesla will have to wait until the difference is a factor of several, maybe 2 to 4, so that a really convincing case can be made to the regulatory agencies. But even after getting approval from the government(s), Tesla will work to continue to improve the safety of their autonomous driving systems.\n\nTesla is already aware of the differences in traffic laws and customs in different countries (and states in the US - for example the rolling \"California stop\" at stop signs is likely to result in a traffic ticket in other states), and autonomous vehicles will be required to comply with local laws. Other countries will get autonomous Teslas later - as an encouraging sign, Elon has recently been saying he expects deployment to Canada (at least for the Beta) fairly soon.\n\nIf you are concerned that Tesla may be underestimating the amount of work required to get approval in Europe, then at least it's good that they intend to do the work anyway as part of their continuing improvement of autonomous vehicles. That extra work is already in the plans, even for vehicles in the US. Sorry if Europe has to wait longer, as drivers there have already had to wait longer than in the US to get approval of basic autopilot features.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "> Are you aware of whether Tesla stores/uses any location based intelligence aka mapping?\n\nI think Tesla does some mapping, but not like Waymo. Waymo sends mapping vehicles ahead of time, to map the entire path at very high resolution, then the autonomous vehicles try to keep their place on the pre-generated map.\n\nTeslas can drive where no Teslas have ever been before, using a generic road map (like Google maps?) if available for navigation, and if no road map is available they can at least perform the basic driving operations on the road.\n\nWhen a Tesla drives where no Tesla has been before, it captures details like traffic signs or which lanes are the turn lanes in intersections, and sends that data to the company, where it is used to make an improved map. Periodically the updated map is sent out to the Tesla vehicles - I think one was sent out very recently. The individual Teslas do not learn and teach themselves, at least not yet, so the training and learning is on a system-wide basis. (The company can also send instructions to all the Teslas to look for specific things like bicycles, partly obscured traffic signs, blowing snow, etc. and send back video that can be used to train the system to recognize those things and react properly.)\n\nRegarding the issue of getting FSD for Europe, another encouraging point - I believe FSD is running in shadow mode on all the Teslas in Europe, just like it is in the US. In shadow mode, FSD does not control the vehicle, but it thinks about what it would do if it were driving, compares it to what the human driver actually does, and if there is a difference sends that information to the company.\n\nSo even while Tesla is putting its greatest effort on getting FSD working in the US, the company is also learning a lot about how European drivers drive, and that information will be helpful when the time comes to develop versions of FSD for Europe.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "It's encouraging, but in the March of 9s, it remains impossible to know how much longer it will take.", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "To me the only visible progress that matters until single stack arrives is the number of miles driven without killing or injuring someone.\n\nAnd that is progressing nicely.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Very conservative Simple math: In 2023, Tesla might deliver 2.25 Million vehicles and ASP at 50,000. \n\nAuto revenue =112.5B\nEnergy+Service = 10B\nTotal revenue=122.5B\n\nOperating margin=18%\n\nNet profit: 20Billion(approx)\n\nFor companies with CAGR @ 50%, if the multiple is 100, then TSLA should be at 2000/share.\n\n1) Energy revenue could grow a lot with a dedicated Megapack factory.

People delta hedge options, meaning that they buy and sell to cover the obligation from the delta factor on the options that they sell.\n\nFor many of us, our brokers won't let us sell calls or puts without the capital on hand or a delta cover from another option or 100 shares... but if you're a more advanced trader and hold a position, you can cover the option by providing delta hedging. I.e. if delta on a call option is .5, all you need is 50 shares of the underlying to cover it. If it goes up to .6, then you need 60 shares... that's a gamma squeeze because gamma influences how much delta goes up as the underlying moves and the buying increases the price further, creating a rising price dynamic.\n\nPuts work in the opposite direction, with the Greeks being negative. You can back the value of a put with an underlying, but instead of buying to cover a put as it moves towards ITM and its negative gamma/delta increase, you actually sell to cover because holding more shares as they decline gives you more exposure.\n\nSo gamma squeezes can work in the negative direction as well. And that combined with margin and fluctuating bond yields means you can end up in a negative feedback loop. Typically, bond yields rise, people buy them, and then the yields go down, but tapering is amplifying people's concerns because it's basically frontloading (combined with market speculation on rate hikes) bond yield increases while at the same time increasing the number of bonds actively on the market (since the Fed isn't locking them up)... that's driving a continuous reassessment of risk and helping keep the feedback loop moving down.\n\nEventually this will settle out.... that'll happen when the weaker hands complete capitulation and the selling pressure slows, or when good news brings buying.\n\nI don't think it has a huge amount to do with the amount of underlying on margin, per-se, because the cover will happen on the way down either way, but the heavy margin issue definitely amplifies the downside pressure.", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "I always wondered what delta hedging meant", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "Gamma squeezes are more commonly to the downside than upside", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "Absolutely no one can know the future.", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "Nancy Pelosi?", "score": 33, "replies": [{"body": "Lol", "score": 4, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "He is onto something with the margin calls being due.

{"title": "Market’s Anticipation of Continuous Rate Hikes Is Wrong: Calling Out the Fed’s Bluff", "selftext": "**Introduction** \n\nI believe that the current market sentiment of continuous rate hikes from the federal reserve to combat high inflation and to cool down what is considered a “hot” economy is false and misplaced. I believe that beneath the surface, there are a lot of fundamental weaknesses that have not been addressed throughout the entirety of the pandemic and the Federal Reserve is fully aware of this. However, there is clearly an excess in terms of valuation in many areas of the stock market and in alternative asset classes and knowing the dangers these unfounded valuations can pose in the long run, the Federal reserve will do its best to bring valuations into a more reasonable range without upsetting the overall stock market.    \n\n**GDP Stagnant growth**\n\nIf you were paying attention the last couple of quarters you would realize that real GDP growth in the US has slowed down a lot to 2.3% in 21q3 from a 6.7% in 21q2 on an annual basis. Looking underneath that headline, it’s obvious that the main reason behind this drastic drop in growth rates comes from a sharp decrease in personal consumption expenditures from 7.92% in 21q2 to 1.35% in 21q3. This is primarily the result of a drop in expenditures on goods, with both durable and non-durable goods showing an actual decline for the first time this year. \n\nServices, another component of personal expenditures also decreased as well but at a more modest pace. What this shows me is that people are finally running out of the money they got from the stimulus cheques and the enhanced unemployment benefits, which means consumer spending, which accounts for 70% of US GDP can no longer be relied upon to prop up the GDP figures. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Consumer expenditure on goods and services are going down as they run out of stimmy money. ](https://preview.redd.it/rhlb9tandcd81.jpg?width=1078&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=30396f56214771238943ed1728213332fceb4c5b)\n\nWhat’s more is that the other components of GDP can not be relied upon as well because all of them are in the negatives with the exception of change in nonfarm private inventories with a growth of 2.2% but I think this will become negative as well since there is no point for retailers to overstock in inventory if the consumers are not there to buy them.   \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Retail and wholesale purchases of inventories will also become negative as well as companies such as Costco and Target overstock their shelves based on a misconception of continuously strong conusmer demand. ](https://preview.redd.it/uwfywyzndcd81.jpg?width=1098&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c2b17f0e4ca747e7c20ca9579d1c768a3a02333f)\n\nLastly, to drill the point home, personal savings rate in the us is now down to 6.9%. This is on par with figures pre-pandemic so the idea that consumers have a hidden cash stockpile is out of the question. The amount of spending you saw during the summer months are the result of one-time government assistance programs and the money has run out. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Savings rate are now at pre-pandemic levels meaning a sudden increase in consumer spending is not possible. ](https://preview.redd.it/etbyu4oxdcd81.jpg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=35bc0852b10eb19715bf3db02b0b1b54449b9504)\n\n**Labor force participation and why the unemployment figure is a lie**\n\nThe unemployment figures are full of sh\\*t. The 3.9% unemployment figures is fundamentally flawed and is designed to misguide the general public into thinking everything is going fine. One of the main reasons why is because it does not include labor participation rate. This is the rate in which people who are eligible to work are actually working or actively searching for work. Right now, it’s at a record low of 62% and stagnated. Just stop and think about it. Only 62% of people who are capable of working are actually working and providing an income. That is ridiculously low and clearly a fundamental flaw in the labor market. The labor market is not as tight as the media paints it out to be. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dpv8f5z2ecd81.jpg?width=680&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=557588262eb4aada939a7ce00350c43bcf49d100\n\n**Areas of high inflation**\n\nMy other point is that inflation is not evenly spread across all goods and services. Just take a look at this table from the Bureau of Labor Statistics that gives a breakdown of where CPI increases are coming from for the last 12 months. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Most of the inflation is driven by autmobiles and gas prices.](https://preview.redd.it/ptqy691gecd81.jpg?width=823&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5888f858a15e415aa8125bc5763dd72e23bfd92e)\n\nFrom this table it is obvious that the vast majority of inflationary pressures comes from fuel and automobiles. This is evident of supply chain bottlenecks and material shortages rather than a systematic failure in monetary policy. Just think about it for a second. Oil prices are high because supply cannot catch up to the sudden increase in demand. Automobile prices are going up because manufacturers can’t get semiconductors to finish their product. What’s more is that the ports are all blocked up due to a shortage or truckers, shipping containers, and a host of other issues. Putting this all together it becomes clear that a tighter monetary policy is going to have little to no effect on the core underlying issues driving up inflation. A decrease in QE isn’t going to produce more cars just like a 25bps hike isn’t going to unblock the ports. \n\nMy final point to drive this home is to look at the M2 money velocity. This is the rate at which money changes hands. In a true hyperinflationary environment, the velocity of money should also increase in tandem with M2 supply since the longer you hold on to it, the more value it loses. Looking at this, it shows a different picture: \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The money that was \\\\\"printed\\\\\" is not changing hands, rather it is staying in the financial system. ](https://preview.redd.it/sx2nhq8necd81.jpg?width=1157&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8a0f01c0e3aee5809d42b2b9838d1e3421fe3f80)\n\nIt is sitting at record lows. What this means is that all the money that was printed is staying within the financial system. It isn’t being leaked out into the general economy so the notion that the QE is causing this inflation is completely false and misguided. \n\n**TIPS**\n\nAnother key area to focus on is what the smart money is thinking. A good way to gauge Wall Street’s predictions on long term inflation is through TIPS or breakeven inflation rate. This is the spread between a 5-Year Treasury Constant Maturity Security and 5-Year Treasury Inflation Indexed Constant Maturity Security. It is used to imply what market participants expect inflation to be in 5 years. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Wall Street predicts average inflation in next five years to be 2.7&#37;. A far cry from the 7&#37; we are seeing currently. ](https://preview.redd.it/26axv2jsecd81.jpg?width=1171&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=90713970283d124509d89b13b0c62f31e95620f0)\n\nAs you can see, the rate is 2.7%, far below the 7% figure we got recently. What this means is that even though inflation remains stubbornly high for now, it is expected to calm down in the near future and we hit a 2.7% average. \n\n**Political Pressure and Asset Speculation**\n\nLastly, this part is mostly speculation so put on your Alex Jones’ tinfoil hat on. I believe that the primary reasons behind a fed hike is because of political pressure and the need to tackle pockets of excess in the markets driven purely by speculation. The political pressure comes mostly from politicians and everyday Americans complaining about inflation and wondering what the Fed will do about it. They think the inflation is mostly due to the Fed’s monetary policy but in reality, it is due to supply chain bottlenecks and covid restrictions. The Fed on the other hand cannot attack these accusations head on and shift the blame to the federal government. Because if they do, they will indirectly attack the Brandon administration and will be dragged into a partisan political shitshow, something that is definitely against the Fed’s interest. So instead, they are going to do what every bureaucrat is going to do: Talk a good game but really don’t do shit and wait for the problem to sort itself out. Just take a look at Brainard’s recent confirmation hearing where she stated she will do everything she can to bring inflation under control all the while knowing that raising rates or cutting QE isn’t really going to have any effect. All of this is designed to look like the Fed is on top of things but in reality, they are going to let it sort itself out because the economy is still fundamentally weak and small businesses are still hanging by a thread so if they make lending too difficult, they are going to have another downturn on their hands and look like absolute jackasses. \n\nNow in terms of speculation, the Fed knows valuations in certain assets such as made-up internet money (**fight me**) and crappy meme stocks have gotten ahead of itself and they need to stamp it down or look completely complacent and fuel another asset bubble. That being said, cutting off QE in March and threatening to raise rates is a good move because its them sending the *nudge nudge wink wink* signal that the party is over for rampant speculations. A dying movie theater chain company shouldn’t be worth billions, EV companies with $0 in sales shouldn’t have a multi-billion-dollar market cap, etc. \n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe Fed is most likely going to raise rates in the first quarter, if not definitely the first half. The market is expecting it and the Fed has to do it in order to look like they care about inflation as well as bringing the rampant speculation to an end. But, because of the weaknesses of the economy, the Fed has their hands tied behind their back and it is doubtful they can raise rates 4-5 times this year which is what the market is currently expecting. I predict that the Fed will raise rates once in the first half and when they do so put out a carefully worded statement that opens the door to a halt in further hikes if the situation changes. The Fed knows the economy is weak and it knows the market can’t take too much tightening but they need to look like they are doing something about inflation and speculation so they will bite the bullet on this one.  \n\nAll that being said we are most likely heading back to a 2018-2019 style stock market. Economic growth is shit but not too terrible that stocks crash and die. The Fed will remain loose with monetary policy but there won't be breakneck rallies. Meme stocks with crappy fundamentals like AMC, CLOV, etc etc are most likely going to underperform the general market.", "id": "sai5u6", "created_utc": 1642902732.0, "score": 142, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 97, "comments": [{"body": "Without significant improvements in productivity, or population growth, this is mean reversion.

The 10 year rate is already priced at basically what it would be if the fed funds rate was 1%.\n\nHowever I think that’s the point. There is nothing that can be done monetarily to fix the supply side problem of inflation. Jpow was clearly banking on some easement to happen over the last year but it’s only gotten worse. I’ve seen various articles saying the bottleneck is port efficiency or some saying lack of port workers, or truck drivers or covid protocols, you name it. The one constant is that nothing has been done to change those bottlenecks so the supply chain disruption is here to stay for a long time. The only thing that can be done now is reducing the demand. Even though a few .25% hikes will barely dent the demand it’s the only thing the fed can do.\n\nI agree with what you’re saying though that too many will be bad for the economy because of the labor participation issue. Right now I think the market is finally repricing assets in accordance with the new 10 year rate and the forecast for it to go up over 2%. There’s a portion of the market out there that thinks 7 or 8 rate hikes are coming but assuming jpow doesn’t come off that hawkish in this FOMC I think there should be a bounce back in SPY since such a high 10 year rate forecast won’t be priced in anymore. \n\nThe inflation problem still isn’t going away though and we’re going to see bad numbers again when the Jan inflation report comes out.

Instead, it buys debt instruments from Banks, allowing them to refinance and to keep providing financing services to the economy, albeit with no risk and therefore low prices. Those Banks not using the refinancing park the cash in overnight facilities, hence the large increases in overnight repo we saw over the past months. Could it not be that the growth of that repo facility is the reason why the FED now thinks it’s policy is ineffective? Banks are repoing for cash but not necessarily lending more, resulting in that stagnant pool of cash?\n\nIn any case, raising rates while it still has all those debt instruments on balance sheet is surely counterproductive.

{"title": "Why this will not be a market crash like 2008 or 2000", "selftext": "I've noticed the sentiment in this subreddit and others have shifted from being bears in denial to openly bearish. I'm going to give you guys a few reasons why this will not be a full-on market crash.\n\n1. What is the catalyst causing the selloff?\n\nThe general consensus is that the raising of interest rates and hawkish approach from the fed is fueling the selloff. That news has been out for a long time and the fed has made it known for a while that rate hikes were coming. So whats causing the selling? Its the weak and scared money leaving the market.\n\n2. When was the last time that there were similar market conditions? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mux8r0ajscd81.png?width=828&format=png&auto=webp&s=431970a9bcd3b0cd63f6bf166e6b0d469c80f95b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lk3perbnscd81.png?width=828&format=png&auto=webp&s=42d0f781ab45d62e4a573b19fb9a9b36128e66b5\n\nAt the end of 2015 the fed started to raise interest rates significantly for the first time since the early 2000s. As you can tell SPY took a fat dump leading up to and during the rate hikes. From top to bottom it suffered about a 15% drop and we are currently only down about 7%. That means there could be more downside ahead but guess what? Spy recovered then and will recover now. Fears of rate hikes should only be justified for causing market crashes if the fed does it too quickly. That brings me to my last point.\n\n3. Why JPOW and the fed won't fuck up by raising rates too quickly.\n\nThis is an election year and Biden is gonna be on JPOW's ass to not cause a crash of the economy so that people don't lose trust in the democrats. Trust me when I say Biden is gonna do a lot to prevent that. \n\nAs you can see by the chart above the fed fucked up by raising rates way too quickly throughout the late 2010s and they have learned from their mistake. 7% inflation is manageable when we have had near 2% inflation for the last 10 years. They don't need to raise rates quickly. It is possible and probable that the fed has small rate hikes every couple of months to ease us by reducing inflation by maybe 1% or less per year without crashing the economy. \n\nTLDR: This is a temporary correction but probably not the bottom", "id": "sajv62", "created_utc": 1642908106.0, "score": 441, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 399, "comments": [{"body": "Well, billionaires sold a lot of stock quietly during 2021.

The right answer however is that cash is not tied to inflation - particularly large investment cash that's in USD. When people commonly say you're losing 6% in cash due to inflation it's pretty inaccurate for a number of reasons:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Inflation of USD (cash) only applies to discretionary spending or disposable income. If you have $1000 a month to live off of, and meat for the next 12 months is going to be 6% more expensive, and you can only eat meat to survive, then you are unfortunately going to be able to buy less meat or cut something out of your budget. Most American households have little to no savings and live paycheck to paycheck - so inflation matters to their daily purchasing power. And a 6% loss of buying power is significant to them. However, if you have $1,000,000 it doesn't matter. In the $1000 example, who cares if you are now spending $1060 per month on your expenses and meat obsession? Your disposable income is so high it doesn't even register.\n2. At the same time, inflation is transitory. It will not be at 6% forever. It will not be at 8% forever, and the purpose of the FED intervention is to reign it down to 2%. With macro events around the world the USD will likely have stronger purchasing power across international trade and will do well against oil (which is why all the major oil stocks are up in the last 45 days). Anyway, my point is - nobody with a $1,000,000 let alone hundreds of millions or billions of dollars is worried about spending all of it this year to buy meat or some consumer expenditure that is the most affected by inflation (supply chain included). So it will just sit in cash. $1,000,000 USD is a $1,000,000 USD. Since you are not spending it, then yes, at the moment you might be able to buy less with it, but in another year you can buy more with it. Either way since you are not touching it it's not affecting you and you do not feel the effects of transitory USD inflation - even if it reaches temporarily touches 10%.\n3. Meanwhile as stocks plunge and bottom out you have a new place to invest that $1,000,000 - and here is where inflation also doesn't mean shit. Who cares what goods the dollar can buy if the only thing you want to purchase with it are securities? Netflix is 20% cheaper. If it rebounds just 10 percent in the next year you are ahead again.

My last attempt to warn you fucking monkeys got nuked by the mods and I ended up having to post it somewhere I can't link to, but if you click my profile you'll see it as a pinned post, and it's titled \"We're all fucked\".

Then maybe put on some Linkin Park and find a dark corner to cry in, I dunno, you do you homie.\n\nReal quick let's review what I said way back in the before times when SPY was hitting a new ATH every other day because I know only like three of you retards can actually work a mouse to click on the colored letters link above:\n\n**1) RRP** \\- it was a bit over $800b a day then, it's running $1.6t a day now, and still going up.\n\n**2) Housing** \\- mortage rates are starting to creep up, and I'm telling you, 7% official (fake) inflation and 3% 30 year fixed rates DO NOT MATHEMATICALLY WORK.  The current bubble is getting ready to pop.\n\n**3) The CMBS market** \\- first 10 year notes start going bust in March.  Basically its March of 2007/2008 when they start going bad all over again.\n\n**4) IPO's** \\- I said all those companies going IPO was bad, and so far nearly 2/3rds of them have lost their investors money.  Who here bought Robinhood at $85?  C'mon, I know some of you dumbfucks are bagholding that shit.\n\n**5) Margin Debt.**  Here's an image someone else posted about that:\n\n[Yup.  Notice how the bigger the peak the lower the valley?  Big tall peak there isn't it?](https://preview.redd.it/pewvg0jjicd81.jpg?width=900&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fe8ee95bba393f7fb2e793b005489569cf1b2f2c)\n\n**6) Historical charts/precedent**.

That's still true, but now it's below the 200-day MA.\n\n**8) Student Loans** \\- the current can kick ends in May, but it's just going to get kicked again.  Eliminating the discretionary spending power of half the population under 40 is a nonstarter.  Expect more last minute punts here.\n\nSo, now you might be saying, yeah yeah, ok, bear market, correction, all that bullshit, how in the fuck do you get SPY going all the fucking way down under 100?!?!\n\nWell, gather round my little chickadees and let me tell you a story about a guy named Adam Smith, the dreaded \"F\" word, Fundamentals, and how the USA and China combined to generate a giant pile of fucking nothing underneath a debt bubble larger than anything in the history of the world.\n\nOk, theoretically, the stock market isn't for degenerates to gamble on FDs, it's purpose is to allocate capital to the most productive uses and allow price discovery of corporations, plus provide a way for non-wealthy people to make investments.  Now obviously that's a load of crap, but that's the theory behind it all.  Really it's a whole heaping pile of derivatives and bets on those derivatives ad infinitum. And underpinning all those valuations and derivatives and whatnot is the idea that someone, somewhere is actually making money for everyone else to gamble on.\n\nNow, how does that first person make money?  By adding value.  Got a piece of land with a bunch of oil underneath it?  Extract the oil, you've added value, because now that oil is up top where people can use it.  Refine that oil by boiling away impurities so it's gasoline and you've added value because now someone can do something like drive their car with it.\n\nEssentially, all wealth is created based on one of two options:\n\n1. extract resources from the natural world\n2. refine said resources into a product\n\nThese can collectively be summed up as \"value add\".  Wonder why you don't get paid much at your job?  It's either because you don't have any negotiating power to get a fair share of the true value of your labor (examples include the Chinese kids making LeBron's sneakers and Google programmers\\*), or, more likely, you don't add much fucking value because you're a goddamn retard that licks windows and dry humps the faucet.\n\nNow traditionally, rich people got richer by forcing other people to do that value add (generate wealth) and then taking the profits from it themselves - mostly by not paying the people who did the value add.  But lately we've had a new innovation where rich people have not a goddamn thing at all to do with value add, they just move shit someone else built around and try to skim a little off the top of someone else's work.  And that has spread and spread and spread.  And spread and spread and spread, to where a majority of workers just do fucking bullshit.\n\nNow here's a map showing largest employers in the US by state.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/imp6gatkpcd81.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=31fde20587f88334619b43fd81ae8f9471f14da1\n\nYou know how many states have their biggest employer involved in actual value add?  TWO.  Washington with Boeing and Michigan with GM.  Those are the only two states where the biggest employer is actually doing something that generates more wealth.  Everybody else is just skimming a little off the top.  You ever been in a Wal-Mart?  Spoiler, the employees aren't adding shit to the value of anything, which is why you don't get paid much for working there.  Well, that and what you've been doing in the back with that cardboard box and the shrink-wrap machine you disgusting, sad, lonely monster.\n\nSo the USA, for all out bullshit and bluster has turned into a nation of skimmers and sad sacks who make barely enough to subsist on the scraps left by the few real wealth generators left here.  (and by wealth generators I don't mean goddamn rich people, I mean mines and factories and farms)\n\nNow lets turn our attention to the worlds other big power that's super fucked, China.  I know, I know, China makes everything, so how are they fucked on value add?  Shouldn't they be fucking winning?   Well, they were, and they still would be, except for two little things, one, the CCP is so fucking corrupt it makes the US Senate look clean, and all they're fucking stupid greedy.\n\nNow, the CCP started out this play smart, they preyed upon that fact that US CEOs are stupid, greedy, and shortsighted enough to give away all their IP and manufacturing in exchange for a couple quarters of higher profit margins from Chinese slave labor (the CCP is still in the whole \"don't pay the people who generate the value add\" phase).  Unfortunately, instead of being smart with the wealth all this free value add generated for them, they spent it on shit like this:\n\n[It's called Tofu-Dreg construction.  It's everywhere and its worthless.](https://preview.redd.it/ildfkfjmycd81.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7f36b12692e7c1f28e799cb92b9c7c574cb09d46)\n\nAnd, ever since the 2008 global financial crisis, China has been spending money on High Speed Rail to keep people employed.  Unfortunately they built shitty tracks that are unprofitable and the government is losing so much money subsidizing the routes that they've had to shut many of them down.\n\nNow, I'm sure you've heard the stories about Chinese construction companies failing to make bond payments and going default like 10 times each but then nothing seems to happen so you probably assume that it doesn't matter or it's being handled, right?  Wrong.  Nothing is happening precisely because it IS such a big fucking deal.\n\nBasically, China's entire economy turned into a big fucking ponzi scheme based on ever-rising prices of real estate, and it's just been spiraling for the last two decades.  Here's how it works and how its going:\n\n1. Local government needs money - raises cash by selling 99 year leases on land.\n2. Real Estate developer borrows money to buy lease, then pre-sells the buildings its planning to build, using that money to pay the loan for the land sale.\n3. Citizens invest 80% of the entire countries savings into these developers' properties.  Buying a place not to use or rent out, but as an investment.\n4. Developer puts up building using Tofu-Dreg construction, doesn't finish it, leadership skims 70% of the investment cash to fund bribes and lavish lifestyles.  As much as possible is smuggled out of the country in internet money and used to buy Canadian and American land and housing.\n5. Developer keeps pre-selling more and more apartments to keep the game going - this means they need to buy more land to make sure construction is ongoing.\n6. Increased competition for land from corrupt developers drives up prices and revenues for local governments, bribe prices go up.\n7. Citizens that bought early flip apartments for big profits, buy more.\n8. With increasing demand for apartments that will go up in value (again, none of these are ever meant to be lived in or rented out, this is why an unfinished bare concrete shell will go for a premium over a finished apt) developers start issuing debt instruments like bonds and commercial paper, and domestically sell \"wealth investment products\" on spec buildings in SE Asian countries.\n9. Prices keep spiraling up, backlogs of unbuilt, undelivered apartments increase to the point of unsustainability.\n10. September 2021, traditionally the busiest buying month of the year, sales and prices collapse across China, developers miss all foreign bond payments.  US ratings agencies create special \"non-default D\" ratings to avoid triggering cross default provisions on the hundreds of billions of dollars of US denominated debt and derivatives based on these worthless buildings.\n11. October and November 2021, Chinese citizens take executives of Evergrande hostage demanding payment, local banks begin to fail, video of riots in the streets leak to the internet, CCP imposes a complete communications blackout.\n12. December 2021, Chinese development companies begin missing domestic bond payments.\n13. January 2022, Chairman Xi Jinping publicly, personally asks western nations not to raise interest rates in the greatest show of weakness by a CCP leader since Mao offered Nixon 10,000,000 Chinese women in exchange for trade relations\\*\\*.\n\nSo basically, China, western banks, (especially Canadian ones, go read the \"we're all f\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\" pinned post on my profile already) and the US in general have racked up an unbelievable amount of debt and have absolutely nothing of value to show for it.  The ratings agencies are refusing to call bullshit on obvious garbage.  Remind anyone of anything?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5vw2tab18dd81.png?width=2048&format=png&auto=webp&s=74b5b854d67439ed4e8484e98e767d272496717f\n\nThere's no clothes man, the US and China have moved the majority of their economies into areas that don't actually create wealth, and all the growth we've been experiencing is a giant debt bubble illusion.\n\nThe taper starts in February, and rate hikes start in March.  The last time the Fed tried to taper in 2018, SPY dropped from 290 to 250.  And that didn't include a rate hike.  We'll be well under 400 in April.  Hooray for anyone who's been waiting on that gap to close!\n\nAfter that, JPow has to make a decision.  Does he keep raising rates to reign in inflation\\*\\*\\*, thus completely popping the debt bubble and crashing the economy into the ground, or does he double down on the printer and cause hyperinflation?  'Cause no matter what he does, one of those two is happening, and we lucky bastards either get to live through 1929, or even worse 1933 on the depression side and SPY drops to 2 digits, OR, we get to experience 1923 Weimar Republic style hyperinflation, and SPY goes north of 1000 as the US dollar loses all value.\n\nOh, and while the government says inflation is at 7%, it's actually at 15.2%, they're just fucking with the numbers.  Check a website called shadowstats that shows what the numbers would be if they weren't juicing them with \"new more accurate formulas to reflect the new paradigm of a dynamically changing environment\".\n\nAlso, we went into recession in September according an NBER peer reviewed paper.  Who's the NBER you ask?  They're the ones who officially call when we go into and come out of recessions.  Remember, the 2008 crash was part of a recession that actually started in 2007.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPOSITIONS:\n\nSPY 115p 12/16/22\n\nSPY 150p 12/16/22\n\nSPY 200p 12/16/22\n\nWill probably buy some SPY 600c for the same date after the rate hikes crash the market in case JPow is even stupider than I think he is.\n\nI'm DCAing into these, right now they're up 30% from when I first bought.

If we break resistance then crisis averted.\n* If we close a few weeks below 426.40, and break 414.33 I believe we will see a 20-30% drop before years end, which would put us around 378.12 - 319.53 and back into the pre-covid crash trendline.
