{"title": "Number of Nasdaq Stocks Down 50% or More Is Almost at a Record", "selftext": "(Bloomberg) -- A near-record number of tech stocks have plunged by some 50% in an echo of the dot-com crash.\n\nRoughly four in every 10 companies on the Nasdaq Composite Index have seen their market values halve from their 52-week highs, while the majority of gauge members are mired in bear markets, according to Jason Goepfert, chief research officer at S--dial Capital Research. \n\n“Whatever the fundamental and macro considerations, there is no doubt that investors have been selling first and trying to figure out the rest later,” Goepfert said in a note.\n\nAnother way of thinking about the tech wreck: At no other point since the bursting of the dot-come bubble have so many companies fallen like this while the index itself was so close to a peak. \n\n“Valuations are at historical highs, companies are raising billions based on fairy dust, and the Fed is signaling a tightening cycle,” Goepfert said. “All of these are scaring investors that we’re on the cusp of a repeat of 1999-2000.”\n\nTech stocks have been under pressure since the start of the year amid a bond-market selloff that’s driven yields on 10-year Treasuries to 1.72%. The carnage worsened after minutes of the Federal Reserve’s last policy meeting -- released on Wednesday -- pointed to earlier and faster rate hikes, suggesting to some that the central bank became more hawkish quicker than many had expected. Traders were quick to unload tech shares, whose high valuations become harder to justify in a rising-rate environment.\n\nAll this could spell trouble for active managers with broad market exposures since so many stocks are off their recent highs. \n\nThe Nasdaq Composite index is on pace for its biggest weekly decline since November, even as it rose in the New York afternoon trading session Thursday. A 3.3% fall Wednesday marked its worst single-day session since February last year.\n\nhttps://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/number-of-nasdaq-stocks-down-50-or-more-is-almost-at-a-record-1.1704111", "id": "rxusdn", "created_utc": 1641518707.0, "score": 630, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 237, "comments": [{"body": "Tech stocks have been dumping since the fall.", "score": 265, "replies": [{"body": "Every tech stock i have has been dumping since last Feb. 11 months ago", "score": 114, "replies": [{"body": "Nvidia, amd and apple were all on crazy run ups until Nov last year.", "score": 53, "replies": [{"body": "I obviously didn't pick any of those 3.", "score": 78, "replies": [{"body": "Thoughts and prayers.\n\nDespite being really early to the party, still a chance to improve or establish a new position once the investor fear fueled carnage has mellowed out.

Just look at NET going from 220$ to 104$ in less than 2 months. \n\nMost people shorted it during the market correction from 150$ to 130$ but those who made the most money are those that shorted it before it hit 200$ and got laughed at by the bulls who says the bears dont understand that NET is the backbone of the internet and will become a trillion dollar company at some point. \n\nI imagine NVDA and AMD will follow the same path as other euphoric growth stocks at some point and that most people will flip bearish on them and buy puts after they are down 30% or so.", "score": -2, "replies": []}, {"body": "I wonder why Nancy Pelosi bought calls on Disney.

You are making the short term argument. The pandemic accelerated something that was already going to happen. There wont be a reversal and you dont need another lockdown to keep growth going. Its inevitable thus long term, you will be fine.\n\nThe only thing the pandemics and locks do is change average hours spent on the service. This is actually an asinine measure that dates back to the days when they made their money from ads. This no longer applies because streaming companies dont use ads any more so such \"ratings\" are meaningless. Even if you cut hours watched in half, it wont change subs. So no matter how you slice it, your argument doesnt hold water. It wasnt the pandemic that gave them success. It just accelerated the shift.\n\nYour Zoom and Peleton argument is equally bad. Peleton is just another health fad like many before it. They made money early on but over time margins will shrink and back down to earth they go. There is no long term potential unless they can continuously create the next fad. People arent changing despite what the fantasty bulls have to say about it.\n\nZoom is fueled by work from home or remote work. This is NOT going away. Its still in its infancy. A lot of places you would think are 100% remote are still more or less 50/50. For example, Facebook of all places, still has a huge population going to the office. Go figure... but that wont last. Eventually corporate will mandate it.\n\nLike streaming subs, the pandemic was just a catalyst to accelerate this work from home change for many industries. It was already happening and will keep happening because its a lot more profitable for companies and it makes workers happy. There is literally no upside to going back to the old ways unless you absolutely must have physical interaction with something. So in other words, Zoom will do fine.\n\nTheyre already profitable and have tons of cash so good luck with your thesis. They will likely see 20%+ top line growth easily for the next 5 years if not longer. I wouldnt be surprised if we saw another 100% top line this next decade on the heels of an acquisition or some new innovation that works seamlessly with their conferencing. No idea where bottom line will land. Might get squeezed a little by MSFT but MSFT will never take the public sector. They will only take a piece of enterprise and even then it wont be all of it.\n\nAll that said, I do think Netflix will slow due to competition but it will be fine too in the long run.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I’m not sure if I agree with your premise, but I DO think we are still in the early stages of the streaming wars and we will see what kind of long term sustainability and market share there is.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "You clearly don’t know how valuations work and just go by your gut feeling", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "You clearly are desperate for your Disck to \"Go to the moon\" like a sad little beggar boy.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Disney plus is basically required if you have small kids.

They own Cray which means they make and sell leading edge supercomputers. They made one for NASA few years back and sold few to EU last year.

Last year Pentagon bought their GreenLake solution to managed data storage. They didn't buy IBMs solutions or Amazon's or Microsoft's. They bought HPEs GreenLake. That's a seal of quality in my mind. Then they have very good networking segment which is great because due to COVID many organisations are upgrading their networking infra. HPEs Aruba been getting tons of business and also stealing clients from Cisco. Then they also have servers segment which is not breaking any records but it's profitable nonetheless and they have made a lot of venture capital investments into small tech companies.\n\nTo make it even better their CEO is very well respected and prudent manager. I really like that his priority is to allocate capital back to business instead of dishing out pointless share repurchases. They recently got $2b payout from Oracle and CEO said we will invest this back into business. Trust me, most of CEOs these days would announce massive share repurchase programme, or special dividend or some other stupid way to waste this money. I really like how he is managing HPE.\n\nAnd still HPE is trading at 8x forward PE.

It's kind of an extension on the idea that the EU will do \"whatever it takes\", and a further step towards political and economic unity.\n\nRisks I see are twofold: 1. if we have an even bigger economic downturn or financial meltdown and pressure increases on southern Europe, and/or 2. political instability leads to less unity and less willingness for the north to support the south.  The former can very well be a cause of the latter, and the rise of populism as well as separatism are certainly a cause for concern.  I'd say that's not the direction the EU as a whole is headed now, but every time the members states face a challenge, whether economic or political or even cultural, it certainly becomes a concern.

I love the idea of a short squeeze (who wouldn’t want to be Uber rich?) but I’ve invested on the basis that GameStop are in prime position to corner the market for NFT’s. Opensea is a sack of shit but valued approx the same as GameStop. Look at the fundamentals and customer base of GameStop and ask yourself whether they can crush opensea.\n\nThat’s it really. Good discussion though. I’ve enjoyed it and thanks for your time.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "A cult of millions of people becomes a religion. A terrorist organisation that gains power becomes a government.\n\nThere are 3 parts to this conversation which are mutually exclusive. You’re rolling them together to literally confirm your bias - makes me chuckle how ironic that is considering your last comment. As we seem to be in the patronising zone let me break it down to three parts so it’s simple for you:\n\n1. Gamestop short squeeze - it’s a theory supported by incomplete evidence. It’s not the basis of a good investment and it’s not the reason I invested. It is however the basis of your belief that GameStop investors are a cult and the subs (memes and idiots) are not a good look for outsiders and confirm your bias. I enjoy them though, but I don’t take them too seriously. I like to cover ALL sides of a story (hence why I’m here). \n\n2. Directly Registered Shares - the only way to guarantee your shares are out of the stock market and in your own name. This is an irrefutable fact due to the fact cede and Co only hold numbered shares. Whether that has any impact on short sellers is not known yet. I think it does but we’ll have to agree to disagree on that one. \n\n3. FUNDAMENTALS - I’ve put it in capitals because this is the important part and if I’m not mistaken the title of this r/stocks thread?\nNFT and blockchain are the future of digital transactions. Forget the overpriced jpegs which are currently being made into NFT’s. This is Web 3.0 and it’s not going away. Imagine a world where you create a piece of software that you retain ownership of and every time it passes from one person to the next you get a portion of the profit. This is one of 1000’s of practical applications of NFTs and blockchain. L2 blockchain tech is about to be released, this brings the cost of these transactions down from around $50 (a current barrier to wider adoption) to $2.50, this cost will only decrease further as time continues and tech improves (Think how much a flat screen cost 15 yrs ago).\nIt’s a BIG drop in cost and now it becomes a practical exchange platform.\nSo where do GameStop fit in with this? Well let’s compare them to Opensea. Opensea have the biggest nft marketplace at the moment. The market cap of opensea has gone from $1b to $13b in one year. It’s also a totally crap user experience - go and have a play with it if you don’t believe me. The people that use opensea are niche NFT traders. It is the first and the biggest but remember ‘Yahoo search’? I do, it was horrible. Google came along and crushed them.\nThis is what I see GameStop doing with opensea. They have a HUGE existing customer base which can be migrated to their new marketplace. They have partnerships in place already with tech giants. They are absolutely front and centre to corner this marketplace. \nGo and look at the video on yahoo finance saying GameStop nft marketplace is ‘dead in the water’. That clown predicted gaming consoles would be dead in 2010 - in other words, ignore the media.\n\nGameStops current market cap is a paltry $10.74. If they crush opensea (which I think is inevitable) their market cap doubles. EPS is not a good measure in isolation to form the basis of a good investment yet this is what the MSM love to push. GameStop is not a dying brick and mortar company. It’s going through a major transformation into a global tech company and has the cash on hand and the hires to achieve that (go and have a look at their recent hires and look how they’re paid - it’s in stock). \n\nHonestly, forget the short squeeze stuff if it upsets you. Go and have a look at Web 3.0, blockchain (decentralised finance) and practical applications of NFTs.\n\nIf GameStop get this right, they’re the next apple, period.

{"title": "Hedge funds are selling tech shares at their fastest pace in a decade", "selftext": "Surging bond yields have triggered hedge funds to sell growth-focused technology shares at a speed not seen in the past decade. The hedge fund community dumped tech stocks in the four sessions between Dec. 30 and Tuesday as interest rates spiked. The four-session tech unloading marked the biggest sale in dollar terms in more than 10 years, reaching a record since Goldman Sachs’ prime brokerage started tracking the data.\n\nTech stocks are seen as sensitive to rising yields because increased debt costs can hinder their growth and can make their future cash flows appear less valuable. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has sold off more than 3% this week, underperforming the S&P 500, which dipped 1% during the same period. The rate spike in the new year resumed Thursday, with investors assessing the Federal Reserve’s faster-than-expected policy tightening. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note hit a high of 1.75% during the session, rising for a fourth straight day. The benchmark rate ended 2021 at 1.51%.\n\nYields jumped after the Fed issued on Wednesday minutes from its last meeting, which showed the central bank could become even more aggressive than expected about raising interest rates and tightening policy. Goldman noted that hedge funds’ selling of tech stocks is driven almost entirely by long sales, in contrast to mainly short sales seen in the last two months of 2021. The selling was driven by software and semiconductor stocks, the Wall Street firm said.\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/06/hedge-funds-are-selling-tech-shares-at-their-fastest-pace-in-a-decade-as-rates-spike.html", "id": "ryakgb", "created_utc": 1641570948.0, "score": 2461, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 609, "comments": [{"body": "Next news is gonna be HF buying tech shares at their fastest pace...", "score": 948, "replies": [{"body": "HFs out here hiring 20 year olds and letting them panic buy/sell isn’t the equality I expected in 2022 but it’s pretty funny never the less", "score": 174, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 95, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 18, "replies": [{"body": "Major in math and know the right ppl (or have rich friends/parents who know ppl)", "score": 51, "replies": []}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 30, "replies": [{"body": "Fucking boomers had everything easy", "score": 71, "replies": [{"body": "Degree inflation innit.

Then I doubled down and bought one more share of each, if I recall, just after the drop on December 16. Then I bought one more share of ARKK January 7. If they keep going down I'll likely keep buying (not selling) small amounts, then buy more substantially if they start acting like they will go back up. (Note that this would only be with new money. I continue to buy much more TSLA than the ARK funds, and have no plans ever to sell any TSLA to buy ARK.)\n\nIf Cathie only ever bought TSLA, there would be no point to buying her funds - just buy TSLA instead. Her funds are a substantially different investment than TSLA. Her company believes that sometime over the next 5 years, there will be some significant changes in the functioning of the economy that will give a big boost to the beaten-down innovation stocks she has been buying. One way of looking at it is that she has been selling some of her TSLA (when it is already below 10% of her holdings) because it didn't go \\*down\\* enough compared to the stocks she did buy, and therefore she thinks the stocks she bought will on average go up more than TSLA over the 5-year timeframe. I consider it a wild crazy dangerous strategy that I would not try myself, but I figure that if she and her company have done the research and stand by their forecasts, then they deserve a little bit of my investment money to give it a try.\n\nFor comparison, I believe my first TSLA purchase was just 2 shares (pre-split). I added more on the way down including a very large amount around June-July 2019 when TSLAQ was trying very hard to kill the company. I wasn't very cheerful about it at the time, but now glad I did. :-) Unlike the ARK funds, I spend a large amount of time studying Tesla and TSLA, and consider TSLA my main investment while ARK ETFs are a small side bet.\n\nCathie explains the basis for her long-term approach and short-term moves in a blog published December 17 at [https://ark-invest.com/articles/market-commentary/innovation-stocks-are-not-in-a-bubble/](https://ark-invest.com/articles/market-commentary/innovation-stocks-are-not-in-a-bubble/), and in a video released January 7 at [https://ark-invest.com/videos/market-commentary/january-7-2022-in-the-know-with-cathie-wood/?utm_content=193752111&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&hss_channel=tw-2398137084](https://ark-invest.com/videos/market-commentary/january-7-2022-in-the-know-with-cathie-wood/?utm_content=193752111&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&hss_channel=tw-2398137084).

We had previously bounced weakly off the 50dma, forming a rising wedge. The rising wedge then broke down to a chart full of air pocket gaps on the way up.\n\nAgain, I am not saying this will happen for sure, but the set-up on the charts almost looks exactly like that.
