When you put money into a fast moving fad, it is a game of musical chairs, a pyramid scheme and the end will not be pretty.  These crazes become particularly dangerous psychologically when you or someone you know \"made millions\" on cryptos or Ark stocks or memes or even TSLA.   You read stories about \"crypto millionaires\" leading the easy life in the Caymans. No, they have only temporarily escaped and may end up back working at  Starbucks a year from now, because their investments were unsound.\n\nSimilarly Mark Cuban is only rich because he luckily sold his company for billions right before then big crash when it probably became worthless. That is called luck.\n\nPast performance does not matter for an unprofitable company stock nor a digital asset.  doesn't matter if they went up 1000%, in fact that is a terrible sign because it means they are a bubble waiting to burst.  In fact the best investments last year were the stocks that were clobbered so badly by covid they risked going out of business:  oil, travel, mall retailers, etc. But that past is also now irrelevant.  You could have mad 200% on Hertz if you had bought it when it was going bankrupt but now I wouldn't touch it. \n\nI got burned by two former bubble crazes, Y2K stocks in 1999 (turned out it was all a paranoid fraud) and cannabis stocks (turned out weed is so easy to grow there was was a sudden oversupply) and I lost about 50% on each.   But I am now rich and retired because I only buy true value stocks that make things everyone needs at a fine profit margin, and I buy them only when they are down and out of favor, then I hold. Oh yeah, and I only buy dividend payers so I have made 5 million in five years starting out with $250,000 plus I get a 100 K income per year.  Nice huh?     But that was because I learned from the Y2K and cannabis blunders.  \n\nLesson: the only get rich quick scheme is to buy low, get lucky then get out fast Like Mark Cuban did. But did you see how Cuban lost 100% on a crypto recently?   Of course he can afford to throw his money around recklessly.  High spec investments are a casino basically and maybe a corrupt dishonest one with marked cards and loaded dice where the house controls the game. \n\nRemember, with a speculative asset you are more likely to lose than win so even if your friend made 100% last year you could lose 100%. And I have had stocks that went to zero, it happens. One y2K went out of business from $15 down to zero in a few months.

{"title": "My 8 investing guidelines", "selftext": " \n\nI've been investing, trading, gambling for about 5 years now and I've done pretty much every rookie mistake there is. Sold winners from 2016 (Shop,Nvidia,AMD,Paypal) Lost fortunes on chasing that pennystock. Played and lost with trying to time the market, option trading.\n\nI've been very active during these years reading and learning and you be surprised how often people get sucked in to the same stuff you self did once.\n\nThese are 8 guidelines that really helps me and that I've learn to appreciate over the years.\n\n**1.Don't FOMO**\n\nYes we all heard it. You know that feeling when people are posting crazy gains on these new stocks, we all saw the EV hype. It's so so easy to get sucked in to thinking, if I just put in some money right now I can get 10-20-50% gains in a few days! It's already up 200% this month, surely it will keep going!?\n\nThis takes some real patience to keep your head cool and realize it could very well be overbought and the downside risk is just a lot higher than potential.\n\nI've seen several sector hypes. We all remember the crypto bubble, the weed bubble and now lately the EV bubble. They all come and go and the more of these you been in from the start the easier it is to realize what's going on.\n\n**2. Cut your losers and let your winners run**\n\nBuying the dip is great when the market is down but if the fundamentals of the business is bad then usually this will just result in greater loss. On the flipside, if you have a few great picks and nothing fundamentally has changed and it keeps moving in the right direction then don't be afarid to keep adding.\n\n**3. When the overall market is down, you buy**\n\nNo one can predict the market, don't waste time on it. When the overall market is down your stock is literally on sale. Usually every sector is down when the market is down, your stock and business has not changed one bit however, it's just a lower price now.\n\n**4. Don't be afraid of corrections.**\n\nYeah it sucks seeing your portfolio down 20-30-40% but realize that stocks always go up, they seriously always do. Just keep your head down, keep buying and play that long game.\n\n**5. Small amounts can turn into big profits down the line**\n\nWhen you get really into investing you seriously start rethinking your life. That new OLED 77 inch? Only 2k right? What do you think that 2000 could be in 10 years? You just want to put every damn penny you got in the stock market because compounding interests are just too good to pass up. So just rethink if really need that new thing now or if it could wait.\n\n**6. If the company keeps growing, why sell?**\n\nTaking profit is good however not always the best thing to do. If the stock you have keeps growing and keeps crushing earnings. Why should you sell? Why just not keep it for years, it sure can be tempting but are you sure that money could be spent better elsewhere when it's easily growing in your winning stock.\n\n**7, Never regret that you didn't buy more**\n\nWe all been here. Why the hell didn't I buy more of Amazon? Why didn't I just put my whole paycheck in this stock!?\n\nYou can never do this. It won't lead to anything, you can't fix it and you honestly did the best decisions at the time with the information you had. Realize that at the time this was the best decision, ofcourse hindsight it looks like you could have done a better decision.\n\n**8. Don't sell and buy in again to time a correction**\n\nThis is very hard and with the momentum some growth stocks have these days you might just end up loosing more of that profit even if there is a slight correction.

And how and when did it ever climb above 50 PE which might be a very optimistic price for it?   That is why I wouldn't touch TSLA with a ten foot pole.\n\nGreat if you made 300% already. I am up 500% on AAPL.  But I comfortaby hold AAPL because it makes 100 billion per quarter and is growing qith a modest 30 PE, while imho TSLA and AMC were the two biggest bubbles of last year excluding digital currencies which have no true value at all.  Now I see TSLA has stopped losing money on every car it sells.  That is why the stock is above $100, but what about the other $900? What justified that?   I repeat, TSLA is a great company but does not deserve to be a mega tech. Whole continents have never even heard of Tesla and are unlikely to buy any of its products.  Also the failure of BBB to pass means no gov subsidies for EVs and charging stations. That is a big setback. Ans also Tesla has a ton of competition now similar to Netflix which also had a headstart and is now very overvalued.\n\nAlso, purely anecdotal, but outside of rich areas of California, who really buys many Teslas?  I used to live in Brentwood and traveled to Palo Alto and saw many Teslas, but then I moved to Florida and despite the fact that my neighborhood is a huge show-off area for expensive flash cars, many Ferrari and Rolls types zooming around, I almost never see a Tesla.  I hear Tesla is popular in China, but where else?  And does Tesla make anything else propritary that really matters? Going to Mars is not going to make any profit, at least not while we are alive, so methinks the 329 PE and relatively modest earnings and margins means that TSLA is about 500% overvalued.  And I could care less about past performance. Enron was the hottest stock in the market 20 years ago. But what is is that sustains Tesla and makes is quadruple its earnings in the next 5 years? I do not see anything. Am I blind or are TSLA investors just jumping on a bank wagon?\n\nOh and why did Musk just sell tens of billions in shares?

But what about all the recalls they just had and the shortages of EV parts and chemicals?\n\nYou say it will grow 30% a year but wait, every single major car company on earth has competing vehicles coming out now, and there are only so many areas of the world where charging stations even exist.  I moved to Mexico and Miami from California where the state subsidized charging stations. There are none here and only a few in progressive areas of Florida.   The Republicans are also against electric cars and they might take over again. God help our democracy.\n\nOkay then maybe China and Asia is a growth area, and Tesla is the top EV name brand yes but have you any idea how many competitors are coming online now in CHina alone?  I see a new one announced every month. And do you think the luxury EU and Japanese brands have been sitting this out?   The thought of an electric BMW turns me on.  Or a Mercedes or even a Honda.  So 30% per year?   And does 30% merit you a 329% PE?\n\nI repeat, I think TSLA is 300-500% overvalued and should not be a mega cap tech.  I also doubt it has brand loyalty anywhere near what Apple has. And speaking of Apple, what if there is an Apple car in 3 years?  If history is any gauge Apple arrives late but then dominates.  And Musk was very upset awhile back to hear news that Apple might have superior battery tech to his.", "score": -1, "replies": [{"body": "My assumptions are conservative.\n\n2 million units a year is not an optimistic number, it's a conservative one.  Tesla exited 2021 with a run rate of 1.2 million cars a year.  Giga Texas will be 500k additional units, and so will Giga Berlin.  Giga Shanghai is also expanding by 50%, so that will be another 200,000 units.  So that 2 million could easily be 2.4 million.\n\nSecond, the 30% gross margin number is also conservative.  Tesla's current gross margin is 30.5%.  It's dragged down because Fremont gross margins are low at about 20-25% while Shanghai margins are closer to 40-50%.  As new giga factories scale up, the gross margins should expand to around 35%.\n\nNote that I've been talking about gross margins. Corporate overheads, R&D, and recalls are the reason that net margins can only be expected to be half of gross margin, and I've got that in my model.  Net margins I assumed to be half of gross, or 15%.\n\nNow lets address growth.  \n\n-Everything above is based on S, X, Y and 3.  All of these models are sold out until the end of this year, and that's only offering the highest end trims.  You cannot and will not be able to buy a standard range Tesla in 2022, the company isn't making them as they are prioritizing the higher trim models because demand is way above production capacity.  Tesla could easily sell 3-5 million a year of those 4 models alone if they had the production capacity.\n\n-But these 4 models only cover midsize (3), midsize crossover (Y), full size (S), and full size crossover (X).  Everything else is another growth opportunity - compact, subcompact, small truck, large truck, mini van, cargo van, and large SUV.\n\n-Cybertruck is going to be big.  Some people love it, but some people hate it, but the fact is they have 1.25 million preorders.  They will easily sell 500k units a year.  This will cover the large truck class.\n\n-The company is planning to release an compact economy model (Model Q/2?), which will be priced at around $25,000 and almost certainly sell millions of units a year.\n\n-Beyond the economy model, there is talk about a Cargo van, although that's a few years out.\n\n-All of the above completely ignore Tesla Semi, Tesla energy, and give zero value to self driving/robotaxis.  These are large growth opportunities if the company executes.\n\nAs for the competition, I expect there to be plenty of competition, but the auto market is massive.  The auto market is expected to be about 110 million units by 2028.  Even if Tesla takes 15% of that, that's 16.5 million units.  For Tesla to have 30% growth, they only need to sell 10 million.  So again, 30% growth is conservative.\n\nThe 2x + 10 growth multiple on earnings comes straight from Benjamin Graham in the Intelligent Investor, in an era where discount rates were much higher.  And Graham himself said the rule was OVERLY CONSERVATIVE in valuing growth stocks.\n\nSo you can believe the numbers or not but they are what they are and my assumptions, if anything, are very very conservative.

Texas paid over $11 billion on spot gas prices last February during the freeze, and we could have bought enough batteries with that much money to permanently fix our grid forever and eliminate gas peaker plants completely. The money that autobidder can make will pay for itself rapidly for demand spikes, and that's why Tesla is now an energy supplier in Texas.

Buy when a stock or sector is hated by Wall St but you know it is a sector crucial to consumers and the overall economy. So last year I bought a lot of T, VZ and VIAC, all hated last year and all hit multi year lows.\n\nrule #3 - never follow fads or care how much Trader A or Z made last year on some highly speculative play. Fads create bubbles and bubbles always burst. Last year was a legendary year for bubble, meme, digital and hopium stocks and alt investments. The year before it was cannabis and I dived in with $75 and sure enough lost 50% and was reminded of that lesson.

Before Musk there was Jobs, but when he died AAPL sold off the the bears had a field day, but I realized \"wait a second Jobs hasn't been running Apple for 2 years, he has been trying to save his life from cancer, and he picked Tim Cook\", so now those buys are up 400% or more.\n\nrule #5 - I am guilty of sometimes holding for too long afraid of capital gains tax, but largely avoid tax considerations. If you have huge gains from a stock you dont have 100% faith in take your gains and pay your taxes.\n\nrule #6 - don't go on margin UNLESS like I did 10-15 years ago you have a very strong gut feeling that the market or a stock is so ridiculously oversold and such a great company, plus it pays a dividend which helps pay your margin interest off, that the worst that could happen is another 5% down.  Because all good stocks recover from their bottoms. Picking a bottom is lucky mostly, but if you guess right you really can win big. also if you do go on margin borrow at least $500,000to keep the interest rate low. There is a big difference in interest between $500,000 and anything below that, and be ready to average down and go to $1,000,000 if need be where the interest is even cheaper.\n\nrule #7 - forget all of the above because anything could happen.

I think it's safe to say that people will drive more safely if they are trying to get a high safety score. Therefore, if more cars have access to the safety score, that's less accidents for Tesla's overall, and less injuries/deaths for the passengers.\n\nThis is only going to improve Tesla's quarterly accident statistics further, and this is without any FSD or complex AI-driven driving features. They are using 6 feature model that predicts driving quality. This is something a university student could develop. The model wasn't even developed for the safety score. It was developed as part of their insurance pricing algorithm, and now they are using it to incentivise people to drive safely. It's a literal win-win for Tesla and it's customers.\n\nAn interesting secondary benefit could be that if people are driving more safely to get a higher safety score, might their driving data be more valuable? More consistent behaviour is easier to model and if say 70% of your drivers are 'good drivers' you can use reinforcement learning techniques to develop the planner and get a better outcome than if you had 30% good drivers. The more good drivers, the better the signal to noise ratio is.\n\nSafety score is also the best channel to sell insurance. If you get people engaged with Safety Score for some other reason (competition with friends, data interest etc) you can then ask them how much they pay for insurance and the price you can provide it at. You can also say, if you get to a 95 score, you will save $200 per year blah blah. Giving people a monetary incentive to improve their safety score also further improves the things I mentioned above.
