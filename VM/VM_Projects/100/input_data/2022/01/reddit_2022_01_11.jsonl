The tech is on a group chat with engineers in Fremont and Alaska, and has been working directly with them over the past few weeks to figure this out. They‚Äôre all working together, and when necessary some parts from cars, including Mark Kroeker‚Äôs, are being overnight shipped to California for them to figure out what going on. \n\nI also am encouraged to hear why a software update is going to make a really big impact immediately for all Y/3 owners (and the update is in progress now, ETA unknown but asap):\n\n1) The heat pump system actually has the ability to work really well, even in temps colder than -30C, because there are two loops that use compression and expansion of the refrigerant (going from liquid to gas to liquid) and those loops can produce heat, even in the extreme cold. The Alaska team has been testing this in super cold, and it does work well. So fundamentally the heat pump can and will work in our climates. üéâ \n\n2) One of the observed causes of a climate failure that has been diagnosed is the front air intake flap freezing open, and blasting cold air into the system when driving on the highway, which is preventing the heat pump system ability to work correctly. The cold air passes by a sensor, and tells the climate system it‚Äôs failing, and then you get the famous error, and the compressor just stops. One of the things they're potentially going to do with software as a quick win is allow the compressor/system to keep working, even if the flap is not functioning properly. And of course they‚Äôre trying to figure out how to prevent this in the first place. \n\nOf note, the Tech recommended ensuring the black grill on the front of your car is clean and clear, as snow/ice build up there can cause the flap to not open/close properly. \n\nHope this helps everyone, I thanked the Tech for his hard work, and this context was really encouraging for me to hear.", "score": 29, "replies": [{"body": "Worthy of a main post and getting shared across the various subreddits pertaining to Tesla.

Here are the reasons I have identified and why I fully expect the price to move to $16 by April and $20 after Q2-22 earnings. (I am not a financial advisor so please check each of these out on your own to come to your own conclusions).\r  \n\r  \nReasons BCRX is still at $12 and why there was recent contraction.\r  \n\r  \nNegative Equity\r  \n\r  \nCashflow\r  \n\r  \nPrice to Sales ratio based on historical end Q3-21 sales (without a FY projection or 9930)\r  \n\r  \nOverall macro trend of Multiples contraction because of transitory inflationary concerns.\r  \n\r  \nRisks or perceived risks inherent with phase 3.\r  \n\r  \nManipulation and short interest. i.e. people who understand the temporary challenges that win a little on the very short term ‚Äì those days are running out, and likely peak in H1-22.\r  \n\r  \nMost analystscovering BCRX have a PT between $17 and $21 with very few exceptions. i.e.40% to 75% upside from today.\r  \n\r  \nSimply Wall Street raises negative equity as a flag to be aware of. They also have a PT of $100. Reality is as an investor, I am concerned and much happier it is now being well managed. Raising capital is exactly why we have a market and other instruments. It is what a company like Biocryst is expected to have. Unfortunately (or very fortunately) BCRX is in the extremely unlikely position of sitting on an R&D pipeline healthier than companies 8 to 10 times their size. The funding it requires outpaces current revenues and cashflow. The market also clearly pushed back on any potential dilution. Perhaps a little short interest manipulation added to the downward pressure since Q3.\r  \n\r  \nHowever BCRX now have a well-crafted deal with some of the most respected and successful investors in biotech (Royalty Pharma and OMERS) on their side, providing the runway required to see through the pivotal trials... with just the right capped amount of future earnings in return. This is extremely reassuring.\r  \n\r  \nIn the meantime, revenues continue to gain steadily with Orladeyo's successful and extremely rapid expansion. If you apply a basic Price to Sales multiple based on Q3-21 results, you get a value between $12 to $14 (right where we are). But 2021 was a growth year and the quarterly earnings in 2022 will be much more like a repeat of Q4-21 based on the market penetration. So expect to see extremely positive QoQ trends through 2022.\r  \n\r  \nMy calculations (eager to see other's share theirs) suggest a FY revenue using a simple est Q4 \\*4 projection of sales to produce a much higher revenue for 2022 than 2021 (the growth year) and based on a conservative PS multiple it would prompt a new baseline price closer to $16 (without 9930). This will only become validated after Feb earnings call, if true and they do not lose patients, expect to see upward pressure even if a more conservative P:S ratio is applied given the recent multiple contraction across the broader market.\r  \n\r  \nFinally perceived risks with a phase 3. Unless you are very new to this space, every biotech company sees volatility and has this nervous period, because these risks are real. As such there are many waiting on the sidelines to jump in with both feet once when the risk is reduced or removed...self included. Redeem studies will give us very early prelim results in late Q1 with more substance in Q2. If 9930 delivers the same results as it did in the earlier trials, we will see more 9930 pricing getting factored in. Thus the expectation that post Q2-22 earnings + prelim results will see the first major step up to $22. If the competitors trials continue to perform the way they have (great reviews in Reddit) and 9330 continues to deliver as expected, we could see BCRX go past the $30 mark before EOY 2022.

Delta, theta, gamma, Vega, rho.  Simply put, the two you should pay most attention too are delta and theta. When you look for options you should check these out in regards to the option you want to buy as theta is the amount of premium the option will lose per day as the option has time decay. Delta is the amount the option premium will increase per point or ‚Äú$1‚Äù that the stocks price goes up, with respect to volatility Ofcourse. As the stock price increases past your ‚Äústrike price‚Äù of your option, your delta increases closer to 1. Also, Delta is considered the ‚Äúprobability‚Äù of profitability of that option. Meaning: if the delta of the contract you want to buy has a delta of .65, the option will increase about $65 per $1 the stock increases and there is a 65% chance of that option being in the money at expiry. Obviously as the stock price climbs, this delta will increases making you more money per $1 the stock moves, and a ‚Äúhigher probability of profitability‚Äù since its moving deeper in the money. \nI hope this helped lol YouTube and investopedia are great places to learn this information, besides your hometown degenerates on Reddit Ofcourse", "score": 15, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for the information, and yes the question was legitimate.

Then I look for 2-3 weeks out like 14-21 days just because again if you are wrong, you have time, buying weeklies is dumb because they‚Äôre cheaper and they have less time meaning they‚Äôll decay quicker AND the delta is slightly less than if you buy an option with a few weeks time on it. So I always buy at the money or in the money (slightly below about 5-$10 the stock price for my strike and then I give 2-3 weeks time) and then I wait for the reversal and indication of the uptrend (or downtrend if you buy a put) and then I fire it off and then I get ready to sell Em back when I feel the move is over for the moment.

Time is always good because when you don‚Äôt have it, your fucked. The other portion: intrinsic value is the additional portion of the premium you gain once the option is becomes ITM meaning the stock price has reached your strike price and continues beyond.

The premium will cost less on calls OTM so maybe you want to buy a few extra calls in quantity for the same total price with a further out strike, than a couple more expensive calls which a strike already in the money. Does that make sense? The only benefit to going OTM is it costs less to which you can increase your quantity of contracts you purchase for that same amount of capital your using.

That will help you understand, why your calls are not going up, but slowly and steadily losing value because you are unable to find any other apes interested in it or the stock at those high valuations.   \n\n3.

Not wise. 3) before you gamble your money away, maybe do a little research in advance. 4) very simply stated, 2 things dictate the price of an option contract‚Äî(a) current share price, mainly the difference between share price and your strike; and (b) time.

You have to understand fundamentals to trade options. Once you determine the intrinsic value of a stock, look a year of two out and buy a call that‚Äôs at or below your valuation (be very conservative), focus on your break even not the strike price. Your break even is all you care about. If the stock price is over your break at any point over that next year or Two, you can either sell the contract for a nice little gain or exercise the contract, buy the shares, then sell them and make a bigger gain. Also, I almost always buy below the strike, I carefully think about and analyze my BE (factoring risk reward), and I‚Äôm always think long term. Options tend To work best when you see a deep deep value play, or you have inside info about a major event in the future‚Äîyou buy a contract 2 years out (a leap), and when that event happens, or the value is realized you exercise and sell some shares, take gains, hold some and let it ride long term (how you build real wealth). This works great in dividend stocks.

Eventually the bank has to buy that treasury back, and the swap cancels out.\n\n\nSo basically real money that could be circulated gets locked up during the duration of the QE cycle. So if anything QE causes deflation. You can see this on the velocity of money that continues to plummet the more QE that happens.

Cycle repeats.... \n\nSo, you can see how the money does in fact enter into the economy through government spending. Specifically, the mass stimulus checks and helicopter money programs they enacted.\n\nBeyond that, QE suppresses interest rates, which effectively expands the money supply by making credit cheaper. e.g. I can buy a car for 5% now instead of 6%.

In the meantime, unless your finances put you in a combination of high debt, high property, and low cash, the value of many of your assets will depreciate faster than their loans.\n\nYes, the dollar values you are able to borrow to spend increase, but the amount of physical goods those are capable of purchasing concurrently decrease.\n\nThe only way to really win in this scenario, in my opinion, is mega debt on property that appreciates, or at the very least retains value, over time.
