{"title": "This killed day trading for me..", "selftext": "I haven't told hardly anyone this because it kills me to think about.  I had started day trading paper stocks. I was reading day trading books by reputable day traders, watching live YouTube traders and actually was doing pretty good. In 1 year, I had turned the original 10,000 paper money I started with into 140,000. It was like I couldn't lose. For every red day, I had 3 green days. I was doing everything by the book and it was really working.  \n   \n   So, not having any money, I took out a personal loan for 5k. Put 2k in the bank and 3k into my day trading platform. I was so confident in myself that i laughed when the loan guy told me 5 years at 23%. I told him I'd pay it off in full within 6 months. \n\n   Now in day trading they teach you to look for a catalyst. A reason why a stock will go up. They also teach you to set a stop loss at no more than 5% so you don't lose everything if it drops. Well I started day trading for real and was doing only ok. I would make 250 dollars then lose 150 dollars. Lose 300 then make 200. I was about 50/50 red days and green days. My 3k was down to about 2,800 after a week. Then it happened.  I read a stock twit at 5am about a small company that just had their product approved to sell on Amazon. I looked it up and it was true. I told myself I would buy 2k worth. When I looked up the price, it was only .88 a share!\n\n   The bell rings and I buy like 2,200 shares. It instantly goes up about 6 percent and I'm getting excited. Then, literally as I'm setting my stop loss (not even 2 minutes into the session) it drops. Alot. Below where my stop was gonna be set. I'm down 100 so I'm like we'll shit. I go to set another stop but it falls so fast that I can't set it in time. I'm down 200 then 300 then 400 and I'm freaking out. I finally set a stop and it sells immediately for a 400 dollar loss. This was the first 5 minutes of the session. Over the next 20 minutes it dropped to .40 a share. I thought well at least I got out before it went that low. Upset and confused about why it would fall so low on positive news, I Ieft to work. I had about a 35 min drive and decided about 10 mins into it to check on that stock. It was 2.50 a share! The app for the particular platform at the time was only for checking stocks, I could not perform any buy/sell action from the app and I was driving to work. I checked again 10 mins later, it was at 4.50 a share! I got to the supply house about 20 mins later and checked while I was waiting on parts. 7.00 a share. I couldn't stop watching it all day so when the market closed and it was at 12.35 a share I literally felt sick. The next day it fell a bit early but then ended at 17 dollars! \n\n   Over the next two weeks it had massive swings but hit a high of 34 dollars a share. Now I don't know if I would have held it to that point but I beat myself up for months thinking I lost 400 dollars when I could have made 60k. It completely killed my spirit. I started sucking at my trades. It only took a few months and another almost 2k in losses for me to lose all motivation and pull out my 600 bucks I had left and put it in a different stock trading account, close my day trading account and completely lose all confidence in my ability to day trade.\n\n   They say 84% of day traders claim a loss at the end of the year. I guess I was part of that statistic. I went from being on cloud 9 with my paper account for a year, just slaying the market to being completely shut down in just a few months. Every time someone brings up \"yo man, you still doing the day trading thing\" I just lie and tell them no I don't have enough time to dedicate to it anymore. But really I think of the perfect trade that I knew would go up, that I sold for a loss and, unable to do anything, I watched it go up 3,500% and it still makes me physically queasy. This was 4 years ago. I am what they call in the business an emotional trader. Just thinking of day trading for real money now actually gives me anxiety. Thanks for reading my story. 100% true btw. Nothing in this is made up or exaggerated. Real prices, real time frames. I just can't remember the ticker. \n \n   It ended up falling to about 3 or 4 dollars a share over the next year, and yes I watched it for the next year but 2k into 26k in one day would have been great. 2k into 35k the next day would have been better.  Turning it into 60k would have been life changing for me at that time but I think what hurts the most is that I found that obscure twit. I did the research. I truly believed it would go up, I knew it would go up. Then I panic sold my perfect trade that was truly perfect. Thats worse than losing the money.\n\n\nEDIT: ok so I found the stock ticker!!!..I was able to log into my tc2000 account from my browser and look at my trade history. it was OBLN. I had trouble finding a chart for it for some reason but I did find one. The prices are totally different than what they were that day. They must have had some splits or reverse splits or something. \n\n   I also got a couple details wrong. I didn't buy 2,000 shares. That was actually a different stock. I yolo'd my whole 3,000 dollars and bought 3,448 shares at .87 each on May 23, 2019. Another detail I got wrong, It wasn't almost 4 years ago it was almost 3 years ago. I sold 2 minutes later at .57 a share. It wasn't a 400 dollar loss, it was a 600 dollar loss. According to the only chart I could find that recognized the ticker symbol, on May 23, 2019 it opened at 20.40, hit a high of 28.20, a low of 18.90 and closed at 20.40 a share, exactly the same as the open. Totally different than what my trade history says. There are some other weird things about this stock besides having trouble finding a chart. On tc2000 it is now listed as OBLN.OLD Also, my trade history is wonky and not correct. I bought all those shares, watched it drop and sold them. Then watched the price skyrocket for the rest of the day. According to Tc2000, I bought 3,448 shares at .87 which is correct but then it says I sold them all 2 minutes later for .84. This is not correct. It also shows me buying 4,000 shares the next day at .57, then selling 3,000 21 minutes later for .55 then selling the other 1,000 17 minutes after that for .57. None of that happened. I never traded it a second day. I bought at .87 then sold a few minutes later at either .55 or .57. It was one transaction on one day. Tc2000 was always a little funky and I grew to not like it all. I'm sure since the chart and my numbers do not match there will still be people saying I'm lying or this is fake or whatever. If those people would like, I can send them screen shots of my buy at .87 on the same day that the chart says it was 20.40. I wish it matched but I currently have both up on my computer and I can send them. I don't understand it either. But I found the ticker!!!

You buy, then they all buy. There is always a lag when this happens but in between you can predict that the price will go up because 100 other people are also bidding up.

I've had some major changes in my life, and two things have helped me tremendously with my day trading success.

Example, I don't set stop losses, but I pay very close attention. (I see you out there, shaking your heads! Stop it...free your mind.) Also, I'm okay turning a day trade into a swing trade if I believe in the trade but it goes against me right away. Make my own rules, based on my experiences and my common sense. I no longer feel stress when something is down 4%. I don't feel guilt for holding on when I should have sold. My rules, my guidelines, I am only accountable to myself. It's like getting your first apartment all by yourself.\n\nSecond, I've had a near death experience last summer. While I don't recommend doing this yourself, I will say that it has made the issue of losing money take a serious back seat on my importance scale. When the emotions are reduced from your trading, you start to see things clearer and can carry on with life while trading. It is 'freeing', really. This aligns with the general advice people give of not using money unless you can afford to lose it, because then you tell yourself 'what's the worst that can happen' then suddenly losing $100 isn't that big of a deal. The downside (if you can call it that) is that when I win big I just smile and move on, whereas in the past I would have lost sleep in my own excitement.\n\nGood luck!", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I guess you read so much about trading but forgot to read much about emotional management...\nIn trading there is no never, We all missed million dollars opportunities but I would rately say IF I bought IF I didn't sell.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "the last part really sells on why you should trust the work you have done the research", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Can I ask why would you try set a stop loss when the level you was going to exit at was already hit?

{"title": "We need to talk about Tesla", "selftext": "As if there weren’t enough posts on this subreddit about Tesla already I’ve decided to make another. I’d like to start with something that will become obvious later in this post: I’m bullish on the company and own the stock. \n \nI think we as investors are extremely lucky to have mediums like Reddit & Twitter to help with our investment decisions. Not only do we have instant access to information, but we also have instant access to discussions regarding that information. I’ve noticed that throughout these posts it seems that the default position is that Tesla is overvalued. The biggest problem I have with this is that many will dismiss Tesla as a bubble and overvalued without digging into the company themselves. \n\nI want to make one thing clear with my post: I’m not saying that you can’t be bearish on Tesla. Nor am I saying that you aren’t allowed to think that it’s overvalued. I agree, there is growth priced into the stock and the company needs to execute to grow into its valuation. What I am trying to argue is that there isn’t nearly as much growth priced in as most think and you’re doing yourself a disservice by not looking into the company. \n \nLet’s start with some of the most common arguments people use to claim that Tesla is overvalued.  \n \n“The PE Ratio”\n \nThe price-earnings ratio is a very common metric to value companies. This makes perfect sense as it’s the price you pay for a stock divided by the actual earnings per share. Now, I’m going to say something that many of you probably won’t like: Tesla’s PE ratio is an extremely bullish indicator. \n \nWhen you compare 12/31/2020 vs 12/31/2021 you have the PE ratio declining 69% from 1,102.61 to 340.90. Why is this significant? \n \n1. Tesla reduced their PE by 69% while simultaneously increasing the stock price by 50%\n1. The earnings growth of 384% (0.64 vs 3.10) doesn’t include Q4 2021 (2021’s Q3 TTM is used as the Q4 report isn’t out till later this month)\n * If you assume that Q4 EPS will be ~2.5 then the PE ratio drops to under 200 with EPS growth over 700%! \n * If you annualized that Q4 EPS and assumed no growth throughout 2022 in both the stock price and earnings, then you’d end 2022 with a PE of 105.\n \nMany will argue that a PE of 105 is still massively overvalued, but I’m more interested in the >700% earnings growth. Considering Tesla is still (somehow) ramping their Fremont & Shanghai factories and has two more massive factories in Austin & Berlin coming online sometime this year, I have a hard time believing that their EPS won’t continue to climb.  \n \nThat’s why, to me, their PE is an “extremely bullish indicator”. PE shouldn’t be used in isolation, so when you find out that a company has decreased their PE by 69% while increasing their stock price by 50% during a chip shortage, I think a little more digging is required (i.e., forecasting forward 5 years and then discounting back). Do you really think the best way to value a company growing earnings >100% is a TTM ratio?  \n\n“The market cap is larger than all other automakers combined” \n \nLook at their [profit per vehicle](https://twitter.com/forwardcap/status/1464961280138174466?s=20) and then compare that to what the legacy auto industry is doing. I don’t think value by comparisons provides much merit especially when you consider the fact that what’s happening to the auto industry is a two-part disruption:\n \n1. Electric vehicles \n1. Autonomous vehicles  \n \nYou can agree/disagree with the two-part disruption and that’s valid (I’ll talk about both in isolation below), but if you agree that the industry is being disrupted then it doesn’t really make much sense to compare the new with the old. \n \n**Electric vehicle disruption** \n \nIf you still aren’t sold on the fact that electric vehicles are the future of the auto industry, I’m not entirely sure what I can say. \n \n* They’re better for consumers: easier to maintain, more reliable, better performance/price, better technology, and the total cost of ownership is lower (lifetime of the vehicle)\n* They’re better for manufacturers: simplistic design is easier to produce which lowers costs (spicy margins) \n* They’re much better for the environment\n \nThis is usually when another common bear thesis comes into play: \n \n“The competition is coming” \n \nThe biggest problem I have with this bear thesis is it entirely misses the point. The competition isn’t coming it’s always existed. Tesla isn’t competing against Lucid/Rivian/Mach-e/etc. Tesla/Lucid/Rivian/Mach-e/etc are competing against ICE. Electric vehicles are still a tiny percentage of the overall auto market today with 100% being their future. There is still plenty of room for other players to exist in the same space. \n \nBut there are people who will buy a Mach-e over a Model Y, so Tesla is losing market share, right? The problem with this is it ignores the extremely long waitlist that Tesla must deal with and the fact that they literally sell every vehicle they make. If you don’t buy a Tesla and instead go with a Mach-e, someone else is buying that Tesla. Tesla’s market share in the electric vehicle space will go down but it’s irrelevant as market share in the total vehicle space will increase. \n \nThe disruption is very simple: any company that makes a compelling electric vehicle for an attainable price will sell every vehicle they make.   \n \nSide note: There is also almost a default assumption that legacy autos will be able to ramp as quickly and even surpass Tesla which I find a tad absurd. I’m not saying it isn’t possible, but people are seriously underestimating and underappreciating Tesla’s growth. Their current run rate is already over a million vehicles per year and they’re guiding for 50% growth out till 2030. No other manufacturer has guidance that even comes close (even if they say they’ll be leaders by 2025). \n \n**Autonomous vehicle disruption** \n \nThis is where I’m sure a lot of you will roll your eyes. Honestly, I think that’s fine. Autonomy is a new technology that has never scaled nor proven to work in all situations and weather conditions. I don’t have robotaxi‘s in my model and I’m not saying you should either. The main point I’d like to make re: autonomy is that you don’t need to include it in your model for Tesla to have growth potential. In other words, if Tesla does succeed, throw your model out the door because every estimate you made is too low. And if they don’t succeed, well you’re stuck with a really good company — bummer. \n \nThe autonomous disruption could be a post entirely on its own but I don’t really want to scare potential new investors with wild ideas, so I’ll just talk to two main bear arguments. \n \n“The experts all say you need lidar”\n \nWhich experts? As far as I can tell no company in existence has scaled autonomy that works in all conditions. The consensus among current “experts” is that lidar & HD mapping is needed, but they haven’t succeeded in their goal yet. If Tesla is the first to scale autonomy, then they are the only expert opinion that matters. \n \nTesla’s approach to autonomy is (in my opinion) brilliant. Every. Single. Car. helps with the mission. Tesla believes that the company with the most data will win the race. They’re not trying to solve autonomy on specific stretches of highway, or in certain cities, they are trying to create a generalized approach that will work everywhere. Basically, it’s extremely fucking complicated and no shit it isn’t available yet lol. I’m not saying you shouldn’t give Elon shit for talking about unrealistic timelines, but that’s just how Elon works. “If you give yourself 30 days to clean your home it will take 30 days…” \n \nNow, for those of you saying that I’m an idiot and Tesla will have to include lidar, additional cameras, and additional sensors… that’s okay. I’m not bullish on FSD timelines or the fact that their current hardware will be enough. I’m bullish on the company and its ability to adapt and make the right decisions. If they find that they need to add cameras or other sensors they will add them. The cost to do so is greatly overstated by bears and will be recouped by the massive revenue potential of an autonomous network. \n \n“Tesla is only SAE L2” \n \nBut, but, Mercedes has L3 on certain sections of the autobahn when you’re traveling under 37mph! \n \nGuys, the levels of autonomy don’t mean shit re: capability. The levels are all about liability. If you’re looking at Tesla as a potential investor you should want them to keep it as a L2 system for as long as possible. A L2 system means that the driver is to always remain in control and is ultimately liable for any incident. L5 is obviously the end goal but it’s not something that should be rushed. \n \n//\n \nI want to reiterate that I’m not saying that you aren’t allowed to be bearish on Tesla. There are no “rules” for investing. There will be plenty (probably the majority) who read this post and remain bearish. I actively encourage any bearish comments because I love reading them and adjusting my bull thesis accordingly. \n \nMy hope is that the default narrative around Tesla changes. There are far too many people who adamantly believe that Tesla is overvalued even though they’ve never done any research into the company. You’re entitled to your strong opinion but show us why so we can help each other grow.\n \nAlso, guys, don’t sleep on Tesla energy…", "id": "rz3m1n", "created_utc": 1641659229.0, "score": 157, "upvote_ratio": 0.7, "num_comments": 228, "comments": [{"body": "most tesla bulls dont even get in threads like this anymore, just fyi", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "Neither are Tesla bears.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Story in NYT today about how they pulled ahead when other auto companies didn't have enough chips", "score": 37, "replies": [{"body": "Their pivot to installing a different CPU was smart, but how many times can they pull that off?

No. Clearly not. Therefore Tesla, Rivian etc are all fighting over a pretty stable market.\n\nTesla, Rivian, etc. are not fighting with each other, but with the ICE market. There is already way more demand for EVs than there is supply, especially in the low price points. There is no cannibalization amongst EV sales, except for the really bad EVs made by legacy automakers that are seeing sales collapse after the first 6-18 months (cars like the Nissan Leaf, Renault Zoe, etc.).\n\nThere are not going to be twice as many total cars sold 5 years from now, but there will be 10x more EVs sold than now.\n\n> 2 Did you know 364 million of last quarters profit was from carbon sales to other car companies?\n\n> 3 Not only do credible offerings from other manufacturers make it harder for Tesla to grow sales, it also means those manufacturers won’t need to buy carbon credits\n\n> 4 Tesla has been highly supported by government support for ev sales and credits.

ZEV credits going away wouldn't even matter for Tesla at this point.\n\nIt's also worth pointing out that other automakers have had a $7,500 incentive on their EVs that Tesla and GM haven't had for a while, and still Tesla is easily outselling them all. Government incentives going away would be a bigger problem for legacy automakers than for Tesla.\n\n> 5 More competition means more pricing pressure.\n\n\"Competition\" has been increasing over the last two years, yet we've seen Tesla's demand increase (waiting times for deliveries grew from 2-6 weeks to 2-10 months depending on the model type) despite continuous price increases. On top of that, Tesla's margins are so incredibly high while legacy automakers aren't even making money on their EVs, if price pressure ever becomes a thing in EVs, Tesla would easily have the longest breath.\n\n> 6 Tesla has done amazing things, i also find they have wildly over hyped many of their capabilities (you do know they don’t even make their own batteries right).\n\nThis is not correct. Not only do they design the batteries that other manufacturers make for them, they're also making their own batteries since almost 2 years ago now.\n\n> 7 solar city? Totally cronyism acquisition with very bad execution/slow market.\n\nI agree with this one. Energy storage has been quite lucrative for Tesla, but the solar business has been a drag. I don't think the acquisition was a poor one per se, but the trouble Tesla went through in 2017 with the Model 3 ramp which required them to pull all Solar City personnel off solar panels and have them assist the Model 3 production lines heavily hurt their solar business. Perhaps they'll be able to turn this around eventually, but it's been a massive let down in the past 5 years.\n\n> But most importantly, they are priced for true perfection. Remember, they actually make things. People talk about them as if they are a “tech company” as if they were a software firm where each incremental sale is pure profit. That’s silly. They are a car and roofing company. Their profit margins will shrink as competition emerges\n\nThis is where I most disagree. If you think Tesla is not a tech company, or you think they \"just make things\", you don't understand the company. Tesla \"makes things\" in a way that nobody has ever made things before. Their agile design and production process is revolutionizing the way manufacturing is done, and the fact that within just 10 years they were able to completely revolutionize the way a car is built with things like the Octo Valve and single-piece casted underbodies says it all. It'll take legacy automakers a decade just to copy these kinds of technologies.\n\nIf all of this is news to you, I suggest you watch [this interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pk4Ygmd8fLc) with a former Amazon, Microsoft, Toyota and Tesla employee.

I don't think their margins will decrease as competition emerges, since their margins are coming from manufacturing advantages, I think they will increase. But even if they don't increase, if Tesla sells 7.5 million cars annually by 2030 (38% of their 20M target), with an ASP of $45,000 (slightly lower than today accounting for a cheaper model but also inflation), at an operating margin of 14% (today's value) and 20% taxes leaves a $37.8B profit, at a PE of 20 (extremely cheap with these kinds of margins and growth) gives you a valuation of $756B, and that's excluding their energy business and everything else they're doing that other automakers don't.\n\nThe downside is very limited, but the upside if they get to 20 million cars sold, increased margins, FSD software and robotaxis, a solid energy and solar business, and/or anything else they're currently doing or will do in the future, is massive.", "score": 38, "replies": [{"body": "Battery Engineer here!\n\nFactual Clarifications here:\n\n1)\nEverybody designs their own batteries at major companies from Apple to  to Sony to Samsung to LG to GM.

If you took a Tesla and removed the battery you'd have nothing special, similar to the EVTOL crowd.

Is it Tesla or Panasonic?\n\nIn Gigafactory Nevada, Panasonic operates things from their section of the factory and the completed cells cross into Tesla's section of the factory. Tesla then takes those cells and constructs their packs. Presumably, Panasonic does not allow Tesla employees to enter areas of their section and vice versa.\n\nFor Texas and Berlin, the gigafactories manufacture both batteries and vehicles and they willl manufacture Tesla's internal 4680s. I don't know yet if they will have external suppliers there. I don't know if Shanghai contains a battery section. Model S/X batteries still come from Panasonic's Japan operations. The Fremont factory has been the R&D spot for Tesla's 4680s probably for a few years already, with the yield being the question.\n\n> Does a battery factory mean it makes materials for said batteries or is it simply the assembly stop?\n\nThe goal is raw materials -> gigafactory -> completed car. I doubt they're 100% there for batteries, but they will work towards that goal especially as EVs achieve increasing scales. But the gigafactories are definitely not assembly stops, that would defeat their purpose. I've seen videos where it's clear the Nevada gigafactory is doing ugly chemical things, so I believe most of the cell manufacturing process is already being accomplished there.\n\n> Is material resources controlled by the company or a nation?\n\nTesla plans to mine their own lithium and possibly other chemicals. I'm not sure they will actually go through with this since I believe mining is a low-margin section of the supply chain.\n\nIn general, I suppose it depends on the origin. Elon has traveled around the world to have talks with both companies and governments about lithium mining, for example. I remember reading stories about his trips doing this even before the first Gigafactory broke ground.\n\nUltimately the issue is that battery manufacturing is still young and will take a decade to mature to the scales needed for a full EV world. As with oil, it's not a question of accessibility of the resource but whether the market value is high enough to offset the investment costs of pulling it out of the ground.\n\n> If Tesla invented the 4680 which they claim, why are other companies producing it?\n\nTesla needs all the batteries it can get. And while cells are in high demand, they're the commodity, as evidenced by the fact that Tesla is securing supply from multiple suppliers, without even depending on any particular chemistry. As a side note, they can use less energy dense LFP because of the healthy energy budget they've earned through their vertically integrated engineering.\n\nBattery costs at the pack level are just as important as (if not more important than) costs at the cell level. In fact I'd bet that the main challenge Tesla's competitors are facing is pack level cost, not cell level cost. Even if Tesla was not planning on manufacturing cells, the pack construction and battery management firmware and other software is Tesla's value add, and I think it's important to point out that Tesla is a Silicon Valley company. Their drivetrain technology is not a commodity, it is the cutting edge.\n\n> If no companies has thought harder about batteries, why aren't the lead producers? Why aren't they at 17 giga factories like CATL?\n\nI remember a couple of years ago that the Nevada gigafactory was manufacturing something like 40%-50% of the entire world's supply of batteries by kwh, and that was when they were only manufacturing a couple hundred thousand cars a year. Currently they're manufacturing at a rate of over a million cars per year, and that's only accelerating. They were the lead producers back then and I'd bet they're still the lead producers now (although the pie has grown larger), but I don't know what the current numbers are. Cars use a lot of batteries!\n\n> Honest fact, no 18650, 21700, or 4680 is the same. All those numbers imply is form factor. It has nothing to do with chemistry or power or energy. Most 18650# aren't the same. Doesn't mean they're all some super special sauce, just that they are geared towards a different application.\n\nYes, agreed. It's just that when Tesla talks about the 4680 as a project, they're not just talking about the form factor, but also about the various goals of the project such as using as many commoditized/mass-procurable materials as possible.\n\nThe reason the 4680 form factor is nice other than their volume/surface area ratio (ie battery/non-battery ratio) is that you essentially have more paths for electricity to flow, therefore lower resistance and lower heating, so you can charge/discharge them at higher power. They have other benefits along these lines (They discussed several of these in their battery day presentation).\n\nOf course, there are reasons why such a form factor has not been tried before, so it's not guaranteed that Tesla can pull it off successfully. Achieving a high enough yield may prove impossible, but I'm betting on them figuring it out.\n\nIt's also good to mention that Tesla never relied on \"this one neat trick!\" when it comes to batteries. They never cared about waiting for the \"KiLl3R SoLiD StAtE\" or anything like that. They have always aimed for high commodity and high economies of scale, that's why they went with laptop batteries in the first place.

And all of these have similar pre-order terms and conditions.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that Cybertruck was announced much earlier and will have undergone many improvements in the meanwhile, and that it was delayed in favour of the Model Y because of much higher than expected demand. It wouldn't make a ton of sense to launch the Cybertruck, which will use about 1.5 times the battery, while they still have up to 12 months of backorder on the Model Y.\n\n> Semi truck.

It'll be years before others catch up if ever. Training the neural network requires an ungodly amount of data and AI expertise. And whoever gets actually driverless cars (robotaxis) working first will instantly be the most valuable company in the world. With my estimated 60M Teslas on the road by end of the decade, robotaxis would earn them between $75 and $200 a month per car on average, or $54-144B a year in almost pure margin revenue. That's 50-150% of Apple's annual net income just from robotaxis.\n\n> My point is that they aren’t a dis similar to other car companies as you might think. They have made their fair share of mistakes in a market where they were the only choice. Imagine the electric suv market and pickup truck market in 2 years. There are going to be a ton of credible Choices\n\nPerhaps, but I think the Cybertruck will do better than you expect and trucks are not their most important market.\n\n> As for margins.

Don’t assume a current dislocation will last forever\n\n> When i went to shop for a model y btw the wait was 2-3 months- this was back in September.

And I honestly get why you feel that way. \n\nI actually really like what Ford is doing. I think the Mach-E is ugly as hell, but I hope they can find success in transforming their old product lineup into EVs. I'd buy a 1969 replica mustang EV all day long (they don't have this, but they do have a pretty sweet replica truck, but I'm not sure if they're actually selling any yet?). \n\nBut you have to understand that the \"completion is coming\" argument has been around for years. There are plenty of articles saying the same old thing from years past -- I'm pretty sure 2020 was supposed to be the year of the competition. The reality is that competition to the EV space WILL arrive. It's coming. But the EV market share right now is somewhere around 3-4%, so competition is a given (and I think will actually help Tesla once they open up their supercharger network). \n\nI think you're right, by 2023 all major firms will have EV options, but I don't think that they will be selling as many EVs as Tesla nor will they be making as much money on each sale as Tesla will. I understand that Toyota makes ~10m vehicles a year, but I think people seriously underestimate how difficult it is to just flip that switch and convert those ICE into EV sales. I HOPE that EV sales will be 100% by 2030, but I think a lot of that hinges on legacies (and new entrants) ability to ramp up production. I foresee more shortages in the future of the auto space. \n\nHave you heard VW & Ford CEOs praise re: Tesla's manufacturing? Because of their efficiencies, they can pump out vehicles faster than their competition can currently make their ICE lineup. If legacy is to surpass Tesla they need to grow at a larger % YoY than Tesla who is currently guiding for 50% YoY delivery growth (just did 87% 2021v2020). \n\nThat manufacturing praise isn't just for the speed, but also the cost. I think single-piece casting, structural battery packs, & the new 4680 battery, will allow Tesla to continue to drive down costs. \n\nAlso, keep in mind this has been Tesla's \"master plan\" since 2006. I think one of the reasons why Tesla is able to navigate the chip shortage (and future shortages) so well is because of their internal guidance. They never slowed during covid. They want to get to 20m by 2030 and they have a detailed plan to get there (including securing mines, making batteries, & buying everything that CATL/Panasonic/BYD/etc can provide). \n\nThe EV market share will very quickly rise above its current levels, but I think the demand for EVs lasts well into the end of this decade.

I recently test drove a Polestar 2, Model 3 and Mercedes EQS and the Model 3 was by far the least noisy, so it should be better now.\n\nIn general, I think one thing people don't consider with Tesla is that they don't make cars the way other companies do. They don't make changes to their cars every 6-12 months, they make changes every single day. They test new parts out every day, and if they're better than the old one they're put on a car and shipped. The obvious downside is that QA might sometimes miss small issues that make their way onto a road car, but the advantage is that they can improve their cars 10-20x faster than legacy automakers.\n\nIf you're interested into exactly how Tesla works, I suggest you have a listen to [this interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pk4Ygmd8fLc) with a former Amazon, Microsoft, Toyota and Tesla employee.

People usually still tend to spend most time in the things they're good at and he did mention it's rare to be working on something with a group where nobody is an expert in whatever you're working on, but having a fresh set of eyes of someone who's new to working on that thing can give fresh insights occasionally.\n\nYou're right that one of the downsides is that you might get more issues that could've been prevented, but the upside is that people are having a lot more fun at work because they don't get stuck in a rot and speed of innovation is a lot higher.

It's also not unlikely that they on top of that will have major problems scaling the EV production - we've already seen some outcries from major legacy automakers in 2021 regarding this subject.\n\nSo the 100% you're talking about is not only within reach, the economics of it will be vastly more profitable than 100% of combined ICE and EV today if things go Teslas way. The way things are going, it's not unlikely that Tesla will swoop up a large majority of the \"regular\" car consumer market, save it for the Ferraris/Porches/Maybach/Bentley/Rolls-Royce of the world.

They are simply swamped by Teslas auto sales income. As far as customer tax credits etc, in the US Tesla is actually one of few companies where they don't apply anymore (they've sold too many cars).

The legacy automakers partner with sales & service, Tesla has all that stuff vertically integrated.

In terms of insurance Tesla's vertical integration gives them a huge data lead vs competitors.\n\n>Public charging network is awesome, but in lots of places, competitors are catching up, and not just competitors from the automotive sector but legacy energy companies\n\nYou can look for youtube reviews and road trips using Tesla Superchargers vs the competitors like Electrify America to realize that the competition is even weaker here than in the cars themselves.

After the summary of the Fed meeting in December, people were cautiously optimistic that they would ease into the rate hikes and adjust according to the economic situation rather than committing to hard deadlines. It was also expected that the rate hikes would occur in 2022, and the Fed shrinking their balance sheet wouldn't start until 2023.\n\nOn Wednesday though, the meeting minutes were released, which had two nasty surprises that weren't revealed in the summary back in December:\n\n1. They discussed when they should start shrinking the balance sheet, and agreed that it should be sometime soon after the first rate hike. This means that it might start happening in 2022 instead of 2023 as everyone expected.\n\n2. They expressed their view that the job market is near full employment. This means that they have more incentive to start the rate hikes earlier than later.\n\nPrior to the meeting minutes release, people were 50/50 split on whether the rate hike would start in March or sometime after, but now the consensus is that a March rate hike is definitely happening.\n\nIn short, people were expecting the Fed to be pretty lax throughout this year, but the meeting minutes showed that they're thinking more aggressively, which came as a surprise, and the market does not like surprises.\n\nPersonally, I think there was an overreaction, and with the weekend for people to cool off and think more rationally, there will be a correction upwards. However, the downward pressure from the rate hikes will remain a constant throughout this year, because after the March rate hike people will be thinking about the next one, all the way until the Fed says they're done.\n\nFrom now until the Q4 earnings report, I believe that Tesla will hit a low of around high $900's to low $1000's, and will slowly trend upwards or stay around the same. There's a ton of resistance around $1000, and absent of any horrible news I don't think it will be broken, even considering the macro situation. There's also a general expectation that they will have a blowout earnings report, as well as potential for some unexpected good surprises based on what they announce in the product development update.\n\nAfter earnings, I predict a sharp increase up followed by an immediate down as people FOMO in and then take profit, just like what happened this past Monday and Tuesday. The problem is that there's a lot of fear right now in the market, which has stirred up concerns about valuations and future growth. It's not that Tesla is no longer a good company, but that people are skeptical that it will continue its crazy growth that drove the price this high in the first place, and therefore are taking profits and looking for opportunities elsewhere. And when the number of buyers drops, sellers take control and the price will drop.", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}]}]}

Banks offer like .1% interest on savings accounts and maybe like .3% on CDs, so they are essentially paying nothing to loan out consumer money. However, the interest rate hike now mean that while they’re still paying you shit for your money, now you have to pay a shit loan more interest on any loan you want to take out.

It reduces reinvestment into these small businesses.\n\nIt is pushing those who are at the higher end of the spectrum to go full legal, though.

Here are my thoughts. \n\nIn 1995, the Engineers at Kodak called me into their office to show me this: https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/319W%2BanESeL.__AC_QL70_ML2_.jpg It was a digital camera and they were really proud of it. I told them they would have a really hard time selling it, because, psychologically people want something that looks exactly like what they are used to, which was the SLR type camera with lenses and a vertical way to hold it as opposed to this pie-plate way. Well the engineers told me 'What do you know kid' and rushed me out of the office and the digital camera bombed. Nobody bought it. Then like a few months later, Nikon came out with a digital camera that looks like a regular camera, and everyone ran out and bought it. The point of this is, that it's cool if you reinvent the wheel, but it still needs to LOOK and FEEL like a wheel. \n\nWhen I drove the tesla, the screen in the middle was distracting. It took me several minutes to locate how to alter the wipers as it was raining but the test-drive guy put them in auto mode. I almost died because the auto wipers shut off when going under a bridge (no rain) and when we exited, they didn't restart because there was still some rain on the window and the delta between some rain and lots of rain confused it and so no wipers and I couldn't see and almost crashed the tesla. \n\nEvery time I took my foot off the break, it rapidly decelerated and my neck started to hurt. In a normal car, you can take your foot off the gas and sort of coast a little. In this car, it was either accelerating or descelarating and there was no coast due to the way it recharges the batteries and that for me was really herky-jerky. \n\nMoving through the menus took too long for me too. I get things should slide on and off, or slide open like an iphone, but the difference being those miliseconds of me waiting on the slide for effect is the difference between crashing and not. I had to kind of learn as I drive, and granted it was my first and only test drive, but I spent more time fighting with its interface than not. \n\nAlso, with a mechanical car, so much of it is tactile right? Like I don't have to take my eyes off the road to turn on the heat. I don't have to take my eyes off the road to adjust the volume of the radio or advance the stations because they are in the steering wheel or on the dash and are shaped in ways I can tell by touch. IN the case of the Tesla I drove, I had to keep looking at the screen all the time. I probably spent more time fussing with the screen than looking at the road. \n\nBy the end of my test drive, I couldn't wait to get out. There was not one single 'good' thing I could say about it. I think they went too far and if they put back some tactile buttons, especially for safety like the wipers, then maybe my experience wouldn't have been so bad. \n\nSo while it's great that they made this car, it's a lot like the first digital camera by kodak.
