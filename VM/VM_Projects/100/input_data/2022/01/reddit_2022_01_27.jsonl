{"title": "My first major disaster as an options trader", "selftext": "Around October-December 2021, I made the stupid decision to put the majority of my buying power into SPY PMCCs. Stocks only go up, right? This is what I was doing:\n\n* Buying deep ITM calls, 45 DTE, 80 delta\n* Selling weekly OTM calls (aka poor man covered calls), 40 delta\n\nEvery day, I was adjusting my positions by rolling them up or down the long legs or short legs to reset them back to 80 and 40. This was working... for a while. Until the market took a giant dump and recently it got worse and seems like with the current situation with the inflation and interest rate hikes, we are entering a bear market and stonks won't go up any time soon.\n\nNow, my portfolio is down more than 60%. I don't have any more buying power to buy the dip more. I'm also not selling any covered calls until the market rallies to the resistance, because I'm holding my long legs to save my portfolio. I have around 36 days to expiry.\n\nI'm really frustrated with this situation and my portfolio bleeding. I think I'm hitting the [valley of despair](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/46/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_Effect_01.svg). I could have hedged things more and not put my eggs in one basket and avoided the overly leveraged short term PMCC spreads. Perhaps LEAPS would have been a better idea, but what's done is done. I'm fucked :)\n\nI desire a hard reset, but at the same time, I'm hoping my portfolio will recover. Hate this directionality of my portfolio. I want to go back to a delta neutral portfolio and start selling iron condors and naked puts at support levels.\n\nTLDR: I fucked up by opening lots of overly leveraged SPY short term spreads and now I'm paying the price for it now.", "id": "se6f3f", "created_utc": 1643311609.0, "score": 234, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 214, "comments": [{"body": "When panicking, get the heck out of there and start over with better strategy.

Delta is .4, theta is .023 and gamma is .009. Let’s say the stock to go up ten dollars. Gamma is how much delta changes per dollar movement. So .009 times 10 is .09.  Divide that in half since I’m not adding the new delta amount and scale it up by ten so we’ll use .05 for simplistic sake. So now your avg delta is about .45 (we added the gains from gamma to our starting delta). 5 contracts times .45 is $2.25. Or your contracts move up about $225 per strike movement is this generic example. Then theta steals .023 or $23 from the $225 per day. So we can conclude, in very general calcs that your 5 contracts will move up about $200 per strike during its $10 journey up (if theta eats it daily that is). If it’s the same day and the stock pops up, it’s about $225 times 10 or about a $2,250 gain.

Economic Moat: TDOC has very narrow economic moat and their business model can easily be copied.\n3. User Experience: i once used it and i got doctor from UTAH didnot sent the prescription at all. i had to do several calls to get prescription tdoc instead offered to refund. refund of 50$ is no worth as i wanted medicine right away\n4. Valuation: given all above looking at current valuation it has to significantly keep expanding around 60-80% yoy which will be difficult to meet post covid world.\n\nWith all above stocks i had problem with valuations, too much speculation can sink a stock like NFLX doesnot mean it is a bad company but it was not investible either at 700$.\n\nlastly Market is there because of speculation, but once speculation grows into asset bubble it will explode one way or other.

{"title": "Apple to Rival Square by Turning iPhones Into Payment Terminals", "selftext": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-27/apple-to-let-iphones-accept-credit-cards-without-extra-hardware\n\nApple Inc. is planning a new service that will let small businesses accept payments directly on their iPhones without any extra hardware, according to people with knowledge of the matter.\n\nThe company has been working on the new feature since around 2020, when it paid about $100 million for a Canadian startup called Mobeewave that developed technology for smartphones to accept payments with the tap of a credit card. The system will likely use the iPhone’s near field communications, or NFC, chip that is currently used for Apple Pay.\n\nn order to accept payments on an iPhone today, merchants need to use payment terminals that plug in or communicate with the phone via Bluetooth. The upcoming feature will instead turn the iPhone into a payment terminal, letting users such as food trucks and hair stylists accept payments with the tap of a credit card or another iPhone onto the back of their device. \n\nThe move could impact payments providers that rely on Apple’s iPhones to facilitate sales, such as Block Inc.’s Square, which dominates the market. If Apple lets any app use the new technology, then Square can continue accepting payments via Apple devices without needing to worry about providing its own hardware. If Apple requires merchants to use Apple Pay or its own payment processing system, that could compete directly with Square. A Block representative didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nShares of Block fell less than 1% during pre-market trading in New York on Thursday; Apple advanced less than 1%.\n\nt’s unclear whether the payment acceptance option will be branded as part of Apple Pay, though the team working on the feature has been working within Apple’s payments division since being brought over from Mobeewave, the people said. It’s also not known if Apple intends to partner with an existing payment network for the feature or launch it alone. \n\nApple may begin rolling out the feature via a software update in the coming months, the people said. The company is expected to release the first beta version of iOS 15.4 in the near future, which is likely to see a final release for consumers as early as the spring. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment. \n\nApple has been escalating its push in payments in recent years, launching the Apple Card in the U.S. in 2019 and rolling out Apple device installment plans on the credit card later that year. It also offers the Apple Cash card for digital peer-to-peer payments and is working on a service for Apple Pay that would let people buy things and pay them off later in installments, Bloomberg News reported last year. \n\nThe iPhone won’t be the first device to have Mobeewave’s payment acceptance technology. Samsung, which backed the startup before it was sold to Apple, implemented credit card acceptance with a tap on its devices in 2019.", "id": "sdyaas", "created_utc": 1643289726.0, "score": 1406, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 258, "comments": [{"body": "There goes my SQ farther down…", "score": 535, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah I’m so frustrated with my decision to get into SQ so heavy.

The fact they achieved performance parity with the latest generation and can even go past AMD currently is because of a better design. \n* AMD is supply limited due to TSMC's capacity needing to be shared between different clients. \n* Amazon and Microsoft would also need to build their chips. They will compete with other buyers like Apple, AMD and Nvidia. This will drive up the price at Samsung and TSMC. They can also go to Intel as well in the next few years since they are going to produce third party designs. Additionally Amazon and Microsoft making their own designs is also a bearish view on AMD. However unlike AMD, Intel could capitalize on this.  \n* Intel can take full advantage of the chip act and new subsidies that will come in the EU. Additionally the US congress and administration consider Intel as part of a strategic industry. This means that they will be further supported through several benefits on state and federal level.\n* While TSMC is ahead, part of that is down to being further with applying ASML EUV technology in their production line. Intel has not gone as far with 10nm, however they will be able to achieve parity down the line with their announced partnership with ASML. \n* ARM processors from Microsoft and Amazon are indeed a concern and are great to support their own SAAS products, this is not the case for a fast majority of enterprise software that requires x86. e.g. SAP.

It depends greatly whether Tesla is selling 5 million cars or 2.5 million cars in 2025.

By Elon suggesting that they are not working on the $25K car, that puts off many institutional investors doing DCFs. The numbers no longer add up to them.\n\nPeople in this thread seem to be losing their minds over high earnings and good 2022 guidance = stock fall, but this is not at all surprising given Elon's demeanor. His focus was on FSD and Tesla Bots, not delivery execution in 2025. Tesla's meteroric rise was not because people suddenly valued it as a \"tech company\" or something, but rather the fundamentals of this amazing car company were undeniable. Therefore, people still can't comprehend FSD beyond a car option that adds x ASP.\n\nUltimately, Tesla is not run by dumb people. They will earnestly work on FSD and they will also earnestly work on a whole array of models, including the cheaper car. If FSD comes first, then they'll throw everything else out and commit to Tesla Bot. If it does not, they will execute towards a more standard auto model.

A lot of emphasis was placed on FSD being crucial to future financial performance, not sure why this was a surprise given Elon has not been subtle about this.

I wouldn't be surprised to see a high-priority AI day follow-up come out in 2022 that demonstrates the value of Elon's singular focus.\n\nThe stock prices will fluctuate because of this.

It's importance cannot be overstated. There's two areas of value that may be missed: kinematics data at large scale when applied to general purpose tasking is non-existent coupled with fleet scale navigation. Unlike a car, the onboard memory that can be dedicated for storage of tasking and localized spatial volumes will be significantly greater comparatively. Cars go everywhere, they're mixed function objects. Bots will be limited to potentially geofenced locations. To that end, you can really crank up the fidelity on motion/physics data as well as actuation. Further, it can allow for essentially fleet scale reinforced learning in real time. One bot does X, uses too much energy, another bot does X and uses too little. Over time, the \"wisdom\" that builds up allows for optimization towards specific tasking. This then gets applied to movement, relocation of variable mass geometry, and computer vision for navigation as well as dexterity when leveraging \"fingers\", \"legs\" and any additional accessory mounts.\n\nThe second thing is as Tesla begins to build more gigafactories, I suspect that they will move towards collateral building methodologies. Where bots are deployed to begin construction and validation of production hardware in one side of the factory while the other is under construction. As more area is constructed, and more machinery is bought in, more bots get deployed and the model that's applied across the existing fleet of machines extends outwards to the new areas of the factory; allowing for production to scale exponentially rather than linearly where the factory is built. This is because humans are squishy and bots are not. If a ceiling falls and a worker dies, there's political and legal contention issues that will impact ongoing operations for a long period of time. If a ceiling falls. The process is stopped, an immediate assessment is done followed by a quick remediation and reinforcement; the bot is replaced and the show goes on.\n\nUnlike with current methods, where the linear growth's next link in the chain is that: hardware is sourced. Then humans are sourced. Then validation testing occurs. Then production ramp occurs and may take up to 6 months or more to reach. This will, over time, give them an opportunity to take their highly experienced existing work force at the line level all the way to engineering and give them a greater level of autonomy and oversight in how the plant operates; where each worker may become a \"supervisor\" that overseas a subset of bots. It also presents opportunity to cross train and create a new generation of experts in robotics. Thus, should they ever leave the Tesla workforce, they are armed with highly desirable skillsets and have considerable robotics experience over their peers in other automaker entities, that they can command far better opportunities than would otherwise dictate. It diminishes the need then for unionization, and spreads positive word of mouth value in the difference Tesla can offer it's workers over others in the industry, which will act as a catalyst for attracting more talent for all sectors of the company. Ultimately, the goal is to retain the worker forever. But people like flexibility and opportunity and growth. There's no guarantee of retaining talent. So if you're going to lose say 10% of your workforce over 10 years, why not empower them in a way where they become carriers of your philosophy and way of thinking and working which then like medication to poison, will change from the inside out there other entities over time. Ultimately achieving your goals of accelerating transition to a sustainable future, and increasing competition in the space so that you can never get complacent and stall.\n\nAbove is partially speculative, but is nonetheless a fair assessment of the long term theoretical value of the platform and how it can integrate at scale with Tesla's \"Alien Armada\" master plan.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "I feel like the sub should make a Tesla Decade Discussion Thread for talking about the future \n\n/s", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Did this guy posted pieces of research papers here?
