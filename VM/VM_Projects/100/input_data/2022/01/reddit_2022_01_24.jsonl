But that doesn't mean we should just give up. You make your best effort guess and then adjust as new information comes along. Besides, it's exactly the same situation as deciding when to sell a call that is profitable.\n\nEven after you close the put, there is nothing stopping you from buying a much cheaper put if you think there's a reasonable chance of more downside. Again, same as for a call in a bullish trend.\n\nHowever, I'm making this all sound exactly the same as for a call, but it's really not. The *concepts* are the same, but the *trends* are not. Bear trends tend to be sharper and shorter in duration than bull trends, so you can't just inverse what you do for calls. The timing window is much, much narrower and it is much easier to make a mistake.\n\nFinally, if you have way more unrealized gains than potential upside, it's time to get out regardless, since you have near maximum risk for minimum reward: [Risk to reward ratios change: a reason for early exit (redtexture)](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/pages/risk_reward_and_exits)", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "All good advice.

Vertical spreads are relatively low risk, as long as they are closed well before expiration.  Since they don't expire until January of 2023, there is plenty of time.\n\nTo calculate the risk of loss for each spread, subtract the +quantity row's entry price from the -quantity row's entry price and then multiply by 100 and then multiply by the +quantity number. So for the RIDE spread, it's ($3.47 - $2.78) x 100 x 5 = $345. So that's the extent of the potential loss on the first two rows. You can do the same calculation for the SPCE pair and the VXRT pair of rows.

Sorry for the long post.  My question is about how to think through bracketing a LEAP -- should it be pretty close to bracketing a long stock position?\n\nSo, with this correction ongoing, I am changing my approach a little.  I've been selling spreads just fine for months, but I don't sell those when VIX is this high (>30).        \n\nSo, I have been nibbling at the edges, buying long positions in my main (non-options) portfolio starting last week.  After careful consideration, I also bought a LEAP in my options account.  It's a stock for which I've done a cash flow analysis, and I follow their earnings.  They are acquiring a smaller company for (in my opinion) too much money, which of course is the least attractive thing about their situation right now, but despite that and despite the correction and despite the higher premia I'm bullish on the LEAP. In addition to DD on the underlying, I researched how to get a decent price on LEAPs, and I think I did OK.\n\nThis is the action:  This morning, I bought 1 CROX 60 c exp Jan 2023.  I paid $43; so breakeven $103 / sh.  (BTW, I chose deep itm for a slightly smoother ride, yes, but also because the theta decay is less formidable).    \n\nI'm looking for another opinion on my exit brackets.  I intend to look at rolling down at 50% loss (which in this market should be in about 90 minutes or so -- just a lil joke ... maybe).  If I'm so fortunate, I'll take profit when the underlying reaches my estimate of fully valued (about $140 / sh).  I can afford to lose everything I paid for this LEAP, and it is a very small % of my total portfolio.    \n\nMy question is whether the bracketing I've chosen is typical, too conservative, wrongheaded, should use different goalposts, etc.  \n\nCheers and best.

The volatility of some stock isn't necessarily correlated to SPX, so why use VIX when you can use the IV Rank or IV Percentile of the contract itself?

I've found I make money in steady markets and lose in more vol when working with the credit spreads.  If the VIX is <30, I then look at IV for the individual underlying.  If I think the implied range of trading too wide (which means too much vol priced into the option), I choose a direction and then sell a spread (call if I think downward; put if I think upward).  If I think the implied range of trading too narrow (meaning too little vol priced in), I usually pass it by, but I have bought the spread in those situations.  This evaluation of IV in the underlying and then choice of direction is exactly the process proposed by Natenberg in *Option Volatility & Pricing: Advanced Trading Strategies and Techniques*, Chapter 10.  The VIX rule is something I picked up in a Freeman Publication book (*Credit Spread Options for Beginners*, Chapter 6); in the book, they don't limit VIX as a wind-sock type of indicator to indexes as they underlying, and it has worked for me.

Were CROX to rise to $140, I estimate that would be about a 95% return on my initial investment of $4300 for the 1 LEAPS® call (calculation: with stock at $140 my call with strike 60 would then be worth $80-84 depending on when this occurs, assumes $80 intrinsic and about $4 time value; the time value is purely my guess based on time value I paid today as a theoretical max; that's 84/43-1 = 95% return).

It only took you one sentence to say, \"I intend to look at rolling down at 50% loss.\" Why is the gain % side so complicated? Are you saying you'd hold until you get a 95% gain? What if it's 92%? Or 89%?\n\nSo that's my first observation. You have a simple and straight-forward bracket on the loss side. You ought to have a similarly simple and straight-forward bracket on the gain side which is stated only as a gain % in call premium. No reference to stock price, because at the end of the day, who cares? If the stock only went up $1 but your call is showing a 95% gain, are you going to scratch your head and hesitate? Of course not. A 95% gain is a 95% gain, regardless of how you got there.\n\nSecond observation is if 95% is your real upper bracket, that seems a bit greedy. You have to consider the shifting risk/reward if you end up holding on at 91% hoping to eek out that last 4%, as well as the opportunity cost. I'd advise a more modest profit target to get you out of the trade sooner, for theta and for opportunity cost. You can always roll or rebuy to ride any additional upside.\n\nThat said, a 95% exit is +ev if you assume a win rate of 35%:\n\nEV = (.35 x 95) - (.65 x 50) = 33.25 - 32.50 = 0.75\n\nIt's not much better than break-even, though, I would advise using a loss bracket that's smaller than 50% and bringing the profit level down a bit as well, if you are stuck with a 35% win rate, which is pretty low.

When it seemed obvious in December that stock wouldn't be going anywhere soon, I sold it all so I could harvest the loss for tax purposes. I had been selling covered calls on it for income, and wanted the stock back at a later date, so I decided in the meantime, I'd sell some cash secured puts, since I had the money and didn't plan on doing anything with it.\r  \n\r  \nFidelity won't let me sell puts, so I moved the money over to Webull instead. And I sold some puts on Palantir, figuring if it didn't go down to the strike price or lower, t I'd make some money on the premium, and if it did, the expiration would be after 30 days of having sold the stock, so I wouldn't get a wash sale, plus I'd buy back the stock at a cheaper price than I'd originally bought it.\r  \n\r  \nThen, Palantir went about a dollar and a half below my strike price, so last Friday, I got assigned. Okay, I overpaid for the stock, but I still paid less than originally. Not great, but not the end of the world.\r  \n\r  \nNow that I had 100 shares due to my assignment, I figured it was time to sell covered calls again, this time, on Webull, since that's where the shares were. I could see that the shares were in my account after my assignment, so I knew they were covered and I wasn't accidentally selling naked calls (I don't have a margin account anyway - too scary for me at this point).\r  \n\r  \nSo, I sold 1 call contract for a year out with a strike price several dollars higher than I paid for the stock, and pocketed a premium.\r  \n\r  \nNOW is the part where I'm confused.

However I need to learn a bit more before I pull the trigger.  \n\nI have a few questions throughout this hypothetical scenario below, in order to help me understand, but my main question is: if you buy a call option and want to exercise the option because it increases above the strike price, do you need to have the money to purchase the stock?  This may be a stupid question, but I see all these \"Went from $4,000 to $150,000 overnight\" posts where people show their options profits.  Surely they dont ALL have that large sum of money to actually purchase the stock, right?  \n\nFor example, say I buy a Ford call option.  Looking at the option chain right now, there is one for strike price of $22, expiration of June 2022, with an ask of $1.83.   For example sake, say there are 10 of these identical options, and I want to buy 10.  So I pay (10x100x1.83 = $1,830) in premium, and by June the stock is at a miraculous $30/share.  \n\nOption A is I exercise the option.  I would need (10x100x22 = $22,000) in order to do this, just so I could sell them back on the market at $30/share ($30,000) to net myself (30,000-22,000-1,830=$6,170)??? \n\nOption B is to sell the call option and collect whatever profit comes from the difference in premiums.   (This is where I am lost and havent found good material to help me understand)...   If I were to choose this route, would someone want to buy the call option that close to the expiration date?  Like is this option even appealing, why or why not?  Also, how are the premiums set?\n\nThanks in advance!", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "> if you buy a call option and want to exercise the option because it increases above the strike price, do you need to have the money to purchase the stock?\n\nYes, of course. A call is a contract and the terms are you will pay the strike price to receive 100 shares.\n\nBut don't exercise calls. I've traded hundreds of calls and made thousands of dollars but have never exercised a single call. The first bolded advisory at the top of this page is:\n\n**Don't exercise your (long) options for stock!**\n\nYour A vs B analysis explains why, see below.\n\n> \"Went from $4,000 to $150,000 overnight\" ... Surely they dont ALL have that large sum of money to actually purchase the stock, right?\n\nNo, they used leverage for that. If you buy a call for $.01 and it rises in value to $.38, that's a 3700% profit. If someone bought $4000 worth of those penny calls, they'd make $150,000 overnight, purely on the increase of premium from $.01 to $.38.\n\nNow, the thing you don't see is that the **probability that a $.01 call will make a 3700% profit overnight is more than a million to 1**. So those posts are nothing more than brags from lottery players with winning lottery tickets and you don't see the thousands and thousands of people that made similar plays and lost $4000.\n\n\nSo you should not be surprised that the correct choice is:\n\n> Option B is to sell the call option and collect whatever profit comes from the difference in premiums. (This is where I am lost and havent found good material to help me understand).\n\nYour $22 call would be worth *at least* (30 - 22) = $8/share. Less your initial debit of $1.83, you'd have a $6.17/share gain *minimum*, or $6170. Look familiar? It's the same amount you calculated for Option A! Only you didn't have to go through the trouble of buying shares, waiting 2 days for settlement, and then selling them, when god knows what happens to share price by then?\n\nAnd very likely the call would be worth more. If the call is worth $8.05, you'd have $5 of pure profit above the exercise option. If it is worth $9.00, you'd have $100 of pure profit above the exercise option. And so on.\n\nWhy would the call be worth more? Extrinsic value, as explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/pages/extrinsic_value).\n\n> If I were to choose this route, would someone want to buy the call option that close to the expiration date?\n\nDon't hold options anywhere near expiration.

There is a way to *estimate* what you would get on a certain date with a certain underlying stock price, but it's just an estimate.

Just keep in mind that it's only a guess and the more time goes by, the less accurate the guess will be.\n\nSo that also answers your other question: the market decides what the premium should be on a contract. It's exactly the same as an auction for a painting. If the bidding starts at $1000, the intrinsic value of the painting as of today, it doesn't necessarily sell for that value.

As long as the call has value there will be a market for it. That's the job of [market makers](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketmaker.asp), to make a market for contracts with value. Market makers don't care whether your call will gain or lose value when they buy it from you. All they care about is if they can trade it for an edge. For example, say you bought the call for $3.15 and in August when it is $26 it ought to be worth at least $4.00. But the best price you can get for it is $3.95 (bid/ask of $3.95/$4.00).

Shares of United Copper rose gradually up to October, and thereafter crashed, leading to panic. Several investment trusts and banks that had invested their money in the stock market fell and started to close down. Further bank runs were prevented due to the intervention of J. P. Morgan. The panic continued to 1908 and led to the formation of the Federal Reserve in 1913. \n* **Wall Street Crash of 1929** \\- The most famous and the most devasting one. It was the most devastating stock market crash in the history of the United States, when taking into consideration the full extent and duration of its aftereffects. The Great Crash is mostly associated with October 24, 1929, called *Black Thursday*, the day of the largest sell-off of shares in U.S. history, and October 29, 1929, called *Black Tuesday*, when investors traded some 16 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange in a single day. The crash, which followed the London Stock Exchange's crash of September, signaled the beginning of the Great Depression. \n* **Black Monday(1987)** \\- All of the twenty-three major world markets experienced a sharp decline in October 1987. When measured in United States dollars, eight markets declined by 20 to 29%, three by 30 to 39% (Malaysia, Mexico and New Zealand), and three by more than 40% (Hong Kong, Australia and Singapore). The least affected was Austria (a fall of 11.4%) while the most affected was Hong Kong with a drop of 45.8%. Out of twenty-three major industrial countries, nineteen had a decline greater than 20%. Worldwide losses were estimated at US$1.71 trillion. The severity of the crash sparked fears of extended economic instability or even a reprise of the Great Depression.\n* **Asian financial crash -** The financial crisis that swept Asia began in Thailand on July 2, 1997: After exhausting its foreign currency reserves, Thailand devalued its currency relative to the U.S. dollar. The financial problems spread to equities and real estate. ​​Currencies in Malaysia, the Philippines, and Indonesia also weakened; South Korea came close to default; and some countries found themselves in recessions. Economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York argued that although the countries had shown strong growth before the crisis, their financial institutions had made poor loans, and their domestic economies and real estate markets were overheated. Others pointed to the problems of crony capitalism. Governments and institutions such as the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the Asian Development Bank provided financial support, but they also required reforms.  \n*  **Dot-com bubble burst** \\- The so-called “dot-com” bubble burst on March 10, 2000, when a period of enthusiastic investment in technology stocks came to an end. With the internet taking off at the time, investors were lured by marketing and rapid growth of startups but had an unrealistic time frame for online companies to succeed. Some of the companies had no business plans or earnings at all. The Nasdaq composite rose more than 500% between 1995 and March 2000, then it fell to a low in October 2002. Amazon survived the bubble burst and two decades later, in the first quarter of 2021, reported $8.1 billion in profit, up 220% from the previous year. Driving sales was the coronavirus pandemic. \n* **Financial crisis of 2007/2008 -** It was the most serious financial crisis since the Great Depression. Predatory lending targeting low-income homebuyers, excessive risk-taking by global financial institutions, and the bursting of the United States housing bubble culminated in a \"perfect storm.\" Mortgage-backed securities (MBS) tied to American real estate, as well as a vast web of derivatives linked to those MBS, collapsed in value. Financial institutions worldwide suffered severe damage, reaching a climax with the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers on September 15, 2008, and a subsequent international banking crisis.\n* **2010 flash crash -** On May 6, 2010, stock market indices in the U.S. fell 9% within a few minutes primarily as a result of automated high-frequency traders. \n* **2015–16 Chinese stock market turbulence -** In July 2015, most stocks on the Shanghai Stock Exchange fell 30% within a few weeks due to concerns about a slowing economy. \n* **2020 coronavirus stock market crash -** During the week of February 24–28, 2020, stock markets dropped as the COVID-19 pandemic spread globally. The FTSE 100 dropped 13%, while the DJIA and S&P 500 Index dropped 11-12% in the biggest downward weekly drop since the financial crisis of 2007-2008.", "id": "sb9hpi", "created_utc": 1642987077.0, "score": 284, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 100, "comments": [{"body": "Neat.

This can lead to a yield curve inversion where long term rates have lower yields than short term. In 2007 I believe overnight rates were like 5% and 30 year treasuries were going for like 4%. This is self fulfilling recession because banks exist solely to borrow short term and lend long term. If long term rates are lower than short term they borrow at, they will reduce lending. \n\nIn this case, the Fed is in a unique position to maintain a steepness to the curve.

They'll withdraw margin when you need it most... \n- max 50% profits, no thetha income if you sell the leveraged shares earlier.\n\nWith 2024 LEAPs:\n\n- turn 100 shares of TSLA into 3x 2024 $900c LEAP contracts for probably less than ~$30k each. ($35k was Friday's price, at $943...)\n- your black swan downside: total loss if TSLA closes below $900 in two years.\n- no margin call, ever \n- break-even price in 2024: ~$1,200 - lower than the current ATH.\n- your Wall Street expectations upside, should TSLA reach $1,500-$2,000 after another two years of solid growth: 100%-150% of profits, maybe more - especially if TSLA rallies this year & the calls are converted back into shares with plenty of extrinsic value left.\n- Blue skies upside: should TSLA rally hard in the next 2 years, the upside vs. keeping 100 shares is tripled.\n- Fixed income potential: if the 3 contracts move deep into the money, you can start earning theta by writing up to 3 weekly or monthly calls against them, 15-25% out of the money.\n\nBuying shares on margin is incredibly bad advice to leverage up with a volatile stock like TSLA...", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "You’re selling way too much hopium around here. \n\nYou do realize you can’t guarantee that tesla will close north of 900 2 years from now.

The meme stocks and making endless money on stupid crap is done.  \n\n\nYou see, what most of you autists do not realize is that we have been in an era of endless money creation fueling the stock market.  Most of you guys are not good investors and never have been.  You never understood fundamentals.  You simply jumped on the money printing  bandwagon and thought you were experts making all sorts of money.  The ones that lost money were even dumber.\n\n\nSince the 2008 financial crisis, all the money printing and near 0% rates did NOTHING to inflation.  We tapered, then hit with a pandemic, then printed a lot fuckin more.  No one expected inflation to rise at the Fed, or any amateur investor.  It didn't, and with bond yields so low, the equity market took off increasing values fictitiously of companies.  Now it's at an end.\n\n\nCentral banks main purpose is control of inflation.  They caused this mess. They didn't think it'd happen.  It did and it's worse than ever.  The only solution is to play a catch up game by raising rates....and the more catch up, the quicker and more drastic rate rises will need to be.\n\n\nWhat you guys thought was that the stock market is a hedge against inflation...it's not.  Why? Because with inflation comes increased costs of doing business, then increased interest rates.  Increasing rates on record corporate debt is a BAD thing.  Watch what happens with this corporate debt and junk corporate bonds....Furthermore, increasing rates devalues the equity market.  Just a 1% increase could move enough money to risk free investments to affect equity valuations by 20%.\n\n\nGive your heads a shake cause this game is officially over and lots of you will suffer.  There are only 2 ways the market will go.  Either a drastic short-term reduction or a long term decline much like after 2000.\n\n\nAdvice?  Invest based on real values, not lunacy, not memes.

{"title": "We are in the early stages of an inflation driven financial crisis", "selftext": "I keep coming back and commenting this over and over, hoping more people take heed. Decided to finally make a post in hopes a few people will read it.\n\nThis dip is NOT about the FOMC meetings or heightening tensions with Russia. Those are short term catalysts.\n\nThe real problem is inflation.\n\n# 7% CPI and 10% PPI is a financial crisis.\n\nEveryone with a formal education in economics and finance knows it, but they are not going to say it because panic from the top won't help anyone. AND RIGHTLY SO.\n\nI swear to God 90% of the investors and traders on reddit don't understand the basics of monetary policy and the risks associated with compounding inflation.\n\nYou have to understand that our entire central banking system, and government financial structure is all based on controlling price levels with interest rates.\n\nIf inflation runs away, interest rate hikes are the ONLY proven tool to get it under control.\n\nWe have not seen this shit in 40 years, and last time we did interest rates had to go to 20% in a \"shock and awe\" style monetary tightening.\n\nEveryone who knows anything about public finances knows that we will all be cavemen if interest rates go to 20%. That means we cannot do that again this time. And THAT means we have no idea how to stop this inflation if it doesn't stop itself.\n\n*EDIT: Added some comments to prove the above point. Here is a source for the reality of the US debt situation, and what will happen if interest rates return to their historical mean of 5%. This is from a report written by the non-partisan US congressional budget office. and it was written BEFORE the stimulus packages were passed and accounted for. These are projections for the relationship between debt and GDP. This is NOT a graph of absolute deficit levels. This is a graph of the US government going bankrupt if interest rates go too high.*\n\n[Full report here: https:\\/\\/www.cbo.gov\\/publication\\/56977](https://preview.redd.it/dnibpudq2qd81.png?width=1428&format=png&auto=webp&s=58e84f52c1e56d9b4b6fd50005c73fcbcc80e451)\n\nThe above graph explains to you in one image why the US government cannot and will not raise interest rates meaningfully. *(But there's even more reasons than that. A lot more.)*\n\nTHIS IS A MONETARY PICKLE OF DILDO PROPORTIONS.\n\nUntil inflation comes down materially, do not expect the markets to be anything but bloody.\n\n**Inflation started taking off in March and April of last year. Watch for the month to month changes to start flattening then, because we will be comparing to an already increased month in 2021.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z67utvy9eod81.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=bcaaf59b5ef8dbbc2e36699829aaca1493c9d6fa\n\n**Conversely, if we are still getting increasing monthly YOY reads (7%+) on the March and April numbers (which are reported in April and May respectively), that is when all hell will break loose, because it will be an indication that the fed is genuinely losing control.**\n\nPAY ATTENTION TO INFLATION, AND LISTEN TO HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT IT IN THE REAL WORLD.\n\nMy biggest fear is that posts and memes about inflation are going to take over social media, and when the whole world is talking about inflation, its going to cause even more inflation by driving up people's inflationary expectations.\n\nHyper inflation is caused by inflationary expectations leading to more inflation, which raises inflationary expectations... which guess what? Causes more inflation and increases inflationary expectations further.\n\nAt some theoretical point people are going to lose their shit when they feel this in the real world - maybe its gas at $10 a gallon? Maybe it's $15 bread?  I don't know the threshold for real world panic, but can you see the risk here when you dump this gasoline on facebook, twitter and tiktok?\n\n\\--\n\n*Positions since Dec 2021: Physical Gold.

People being forced to stay home reduced demand for services freeing up that money to increase demand for goods, at the same time that production of goods was essentially halted due to the economic shutdown of nonessential businesses. This imbalance of demand and supply of goods was further exacerbated by stimulus money deposited directly into people's bank accounts. So of course inflation. \n\nThis driver of inflation has persisted due to pandemic related supply chain disruptions reducing supply of goods as well as the large amount of savings that was amassed by the American people during the pandemic from stimulus + reduced spending on services, travel, etc. Supply chain disruptions are easing over time and recent increases in US credit card debt (which had been decreasing throughout the pandemic as savings simultaneously grew) suggest supply off goods should be increasing while demand is decreasing due to reduced disposable income. It makes sense that people have been using up their savings the past year since there has not been additional stimulus and real wage growth has not kept up with inflation. People are also returning to \"normal\" life spending money on services, travel, all that shit. These trends should continue throughout the year to reduce inflation.\n\nThe above is in addition to the fed stopping to pump insane amounts of money into the economy and offering free money to anyone who wants a loan which will also cool off the economy.\n\nBasically, I think the non-fed forces will do more to return inflation to normal by the end of the year than the fed rate hikes and we could easily be back to normal inflation by 2023 and interest rate will still be historically low <2%. In support of this is that manufacturing PMI (which was just reported today and is a ~3 month leading indicator of inflation) just printed it's lowest number since  Nov 2020, has been downtrending since Aug 2021, and has come in below expectations the past 3 reports.

Inflation in itself would just maintain status quo. The American exception would probably be that if most of the added money just ends up in the 1%-ers fortunes, then everyone's purchasing power would suffer and that is obviously bad very. USA have the means to sustain itself on food production, so the impact would be limited, no matter how hard it would hit import.\n\nAlso, you can shock the market with interest rates at 6-10% as well, but realistically it's difficult for a single country to even go to 5% because of accessibility to money at lower interest rates from other countries.
