Unless you see massive buying on the dip (more than a dip this time) it might all be over. It could be a domino effect. If one major crypto company is over leveraged or run by fraudsters and/or if a few big crypto whales capitulate and/or if the overdue regulation or even banning of cryptos is announced, then unlike when China banned cryptos, the space will not recover, it will collapse.

No government body will step in, so then it is all up to the richest crypto promoter whales to prop it up and re-inflate the bubble, or try to.

Putin and his mafias and hackers have been big proponents and users of cryptos, but preserving the Russian banking system and stopping the Ruble from completely collapsing may be more important to Putin.

If it is inflated it wont climb back quickly if at all. Netflix is a great example, yes it may go back to 500 in a few years, but that 500$ was assuming it would keep rapid growth and its not, so holding may take years to get back to where you started vs selling at 500, buying at 400 and gaining 20% shares.\n\nNot that holding is bad, as its hard to be 100% sure of a crash and even if your right it can take years to actually happen.

If you‚Äôre asking about at an operational level, which is what we should really care about as investors, no, not every company would be negatively impacted on a standalone basis. If a company has negligible debt funding on its balance sheet, then higher interest rates hardly matter to it. Companies with strong balance sheets can even experience relative benefits in a higher interest rate environment if said higher interest rates hurt their competitors. As an example, look at the auto industry. Tesla paid down its debt, has a decent cash balance, and is generating significant free cash flow to fund its expansion and operations. Tesla is unperturbed by higher interest rates. On the other hand, its competitors are going to have a much harder time with higher interest rates, including the negative impact of higher borrowing costs for its customers to purchase their products. During a period of higher interest rates, these competitors are either not going to be able to fund all their aggressive expansion plans to try and catch up to Tesla because they can‚Äôt raise the debt capital they need or they are going to incur significantly higher interest expense. A company like GM that already has negative free cash flow is going to experience pain. New EV brands that have little to no sales are going to be in even more pain because not only will raising debt be incredibly hard for them but raising equity will be very painful and dilutive because of decreased valuations.

People have flocked to highly speculative stocks and funds, and it has now come back to bite people in the ass.\n\nWhat is also seen in plentiful quantities on these types of forum is people that needs to be.. \"different\".

Naturally, there have also been people who have succeeded massively by going YOLO into Tesla and Bitcoin before it rocketed. Those people are, sadly, in a minority.\n\nMy core point however is this, by \"striving to be average\" you are actually over-performing most people. Regular contributions to index funds, without panic selling, will outperform most people.\n\nNaturally, it is fine to try and do otherwise.

A failure to properly diversify will lead to the situation where a lot of Reddit users now find themselves in, where they are stuck with a bunch of stinkers while the market as a whole is relatively fine.\n\nThere is also the aspect of trying to time the market, which a lot of people fall victim of. It may not necessarily be as egregious as taking all of the money out of the market, it can be as simple as people selling parts of their assets to buy something else within a few days.\n\nPeople who changes their position regularly are also far more prone to panic selling.\n\nA minor aspect, which should still not be forgotten about, is brokerage fees. It can quite easily add up, and quickly surpass the low costs associated with index funds.\n\nA lot of people are also prone to classic mistakes such as taking on excessive risk (for example by being exposed to heavily to a certain sector). That can be contributed to factors such as hubris, greed or FOMO. This can also be contributed to the fact that people enjoy gambling, and differentiating between gambling and investing is at times hard.\n\nThe above paragraph is also coupled to lack of due diligence, which in turn is linked to limited time, skill, patience and resources. The average person is simply not going to be able to do thorough due diligence.\n\nOther problems that people find themselves in is simply using completely unreasonable investment strategies, while also putting their emotions into it. Excellent examples of this is the cult surrounding AMC and GameStop.\n\nThere are naturally far more factors playing into all of it. A few bad investments can make people lose patience and stop investing completely.\n\nThe last point I want to make isn't directly about money, but rather time. Outperforming index funds takes time, most likely a lot of it.

That has been resolved now and people are grabbing profits and piling up cash.\n\nSo once this correction is finished what are they gonna do? Put their money in 10-year treasuries at less than 2% a pop? Come on. They‚Äôre gonna buy back into the market. There‚Äôs still no alternative. Cash will erode to inflation.\n\nIf we accept the notion that inflation wasn‚Äôt transitory after all and will keep on going, then where are you gonna place your money? Gold? You want to be in the stock market, because the fed would have to raise rates by 5% to hit their 2% inflation target assuming 7% consistent YOY inflation as a new norm. They can‚Äôt raise rates by that much without bankrupting the US, crashing the housing market etc etc.\n\nThey *might* raise them by 0.75%. That‚Äôs not going to make a dent in inflation. It does not behoove the government to fight inflation with their current enormous debt. Taxation through inflation is clearly the plan, and the most sensible way out.\n\nSo here we are selling off to get into cash because things are overvalued. Overvalued? Some assets absolutely, but true inflation was well over 15% last year. The SP500 rose high 20%s, a lot thanks to the mega caps who by the way haven‚Äôt really caught up to inflation with their prices yet, but are making money hand over fist.\nEither way if 15% of those 28% gains were inflation/money expansion, and we already dipped 10%, that leaves another 5% on the table.\n\nI think the sell off will overshoot by 5-10% and then rebound. In other words I‚Äôd expect another 10% drop before we go back up, albeit at a slower pace as the tapering begins and rates increase.\n\nThe economy is in good shape.

How can high unemployment and rising inflation happen at the same time? The falling wages will bring downward pressure on prices effectively stifling inflationary pressure (unless the Fed does something stupid). Am I missing something?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Inflation is a function of the money supply, required reserve rates, and (particularly important for this) the velocity of money. I‚Äôm oversimplifying here, but all else constant, more people earning and spending more money increases the velocity, and therefore the apparent inflation. Additionally, more people buying stuff bids up prices. (Prices aren‚Äôt exactly the same thing as true inflation, but they certainly feed of each other. ) \n\nYou might assume that more people making stuff should increase supply, but remember that the US is largely a service economy. Most of those people won‚Äôt be working at factories, farms, or oil rigs.) Both of these factors increase inflation. \n\nThe thing most people miss about the unemployment rate is the fluidity of the non participating workforce. \n\nGenerally 30-40% of the working age population isn‚Äôt working. Some are disabled, a few are independently wealthy, these days some are anti vax or anti work, but probably the majority are stay at home parents. (I‚Äôve not looked that up, consider it a guess). These people still eat, still consume goods, but don‚Äôt earn money. Think of them as a ‚Äúcarbon sink‚Äú for the economy. They split the wages of their partners, perform a lot of work that would otherwise be done by service providers‚Ä¶you could write quite a few interesting papers on their economic impact. \n\nLet‚Äôs imagine a population of 100 people, 40 have chosen not to work. 60 want to work, but only 57 currently have jobs. So you‚Äôve got a labor participation rate of 60% and an unemployment rate of 5%. To make it similar to current conditions, assume there are about five job openings competing for the the job seekers. \n\nNow add in uncertainty and high inflation. Prices are high, and many families are feeling poorer. We‚Äôre pretending all 40 are stay at home parents, but the same thing happens if people give in and get vaccinated, or go to work, or decide they aren‚Äôt rich enough to retire early, etc. So 20 of them start looking for jobs. \n\nNow some new jobs will be created as those 20 stop doing so many things themselves, but not as many as you‚Äôd think, for two reasons. First, it takes a lot fewer professionals to, say, watch twenty kids in a daycare, than it takes parents to watch those same 20 kids at home. Second, these people are going to work because they feel financial stress. They probably aren‚Äôt going to hire maids, cooks, lawn services, etc., they will just try to do more in the evenings. So maybe they create 5 new jobs. \n\nSo now we have 80 people wanting to work, and only 67 jobs. That‚Äôs a 16.25% unemployment rate, if literally every job gets filled. Wages will start to fall, or more likely just rose more slowly.  But we have 67 people earning money instead of 57. That‚Äôs 17.54% more wages entering the economy, AND more of those families are spending more on clothes, cars, childcare, etc. \n\nSo you‚Äôve got rising unemployment, with rising money supply (from wages) rising money velocity (from people paying for things instead of doing them themselves), and rising prices (from the families that now have two incomes and increase consumption of consumables, bidding up prices).\n\nNote that my scenario of half the fence sitters jumping in at once is extreme.

They can fall if a lot of their buyers really preferred bonds, but bought dividend stocks for income because bond yields were so low.

{"title": "$SOFI - Undervalued. Oversold. A screaming buy.", "selftext": "Everyone know the market has been beaten down, and that trend may continue for the unforeseeable future. But most of the bearish activity we saw last week was a result of the $3.3 trillion in options that expired yesterday. Market manipulation at its best. MMs/HFs win. You lose.\n\nIn this takedown, many bad players have been spanked. And many value stocks as well. The damage has been indiscriminate.\n\nSOFI represents a value proposition that should be trading at a much higher share price for the following reasons:\n\n1. SOFI now has the long desired bank charter. Unfortunately, this long awaited news hit at a bad time in the market. But it doesn't change the fact that this is a game changer for SOFI. This makes doing business better for SOFI. [https://www.stck.pro/news-link/21752187](https://www.stck.pro/news-link/21752187)\n2. Shares are currently trading near the 52 week low of $12.02. When that 52 week low occurred, SOFI did not have the bank charter and other positive factors mentioned below. SOFI is a much better proposition today than when that low occurred a year ago.\n3. SOFI is currently trading at approximately 10x their revenue. This is insanely low for what is now a bank. For the first 9 months of 2021, revenue grew an amazing 77% year over year and those numbers are expected to increase to $1.2 billion on their next earnings report on Feb. 9th.\n4. Analysts are expecting SOFI's revenues to increase by 40% each quarter between now and 2023.\n5. Q3 2021, SOFI reported 2.9 million customers. That was an increase by 96% from the previous year.\n6. SOFI has doubled the number of financial service products it manages for its clients year over year as of Q3 2021 as well.\n7. SOFI owns the Galileo financial services platform which brings financial services to businesses and has a large and growing number of B2B clients.\n8. SOFI has a market cap that is smaller than most small banks. When the bank charter completes next month, SOFI should easily find itself in the top 100 banks by market cap. [Here](https://companiesmarketcap.com/banks/largest-banks-by-market-cap/) is a current list of banks by market cap.\n9. SOFI has their name on the stadium hosting the Super Bowl which will give even more exposure to their company and services.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/63vynxd3fad81.png?width=3200&format=png&auto=webp&s=7310469ad9e2eae97ff7bc0c2260c28dbaea5a54\n\nAnalyst price targets look as follows:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/75ucop1lgad81.png?width=908&format=png&auto=webp&s=277db81ef19b423af102fbcb76d0296860cd169a\n\nThis video does a great job explain how obtaining the bank charter will help SOFI:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49xrLU\\_wQMY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49xrLU_wQMY)\n\nThis is what Barron's had to say about SOFI:\n\n[SoFi Technologies ](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/sofi)SOFI-Nasdaq**Outperform** Price $12.25 on Jan. 19 by Wedbush\n\nWe‚Äôre initiating coverage of SoFi with an Outperform rating and a $20 price target. Our rating is based on the company‚Äôs strong growth outlook, with a five-year revenue compound annual growth rate of 28% through 2026. An increasing brand presence should drive member growth; its integrated technology platform, Galileo, is a competitive advantage that allows for a seamless cross-buying experience aimed at a digitally native younger cohort; it has strong unit economics across its products; we expect credit quality to be stronger than peers, given that its borrowers are at the higher end of the credit spectrum, with an average FICO of 750; and the company‚Äôs pending bank charter \\[approved on Jan. 18\\] should accelerate earnings growth, in our view. The company is a one-stop shop for financial services, and this is a significant competitive advantage over neobank competitors that tend to focus on niche offerings rather than the full financial picture.\n\nAnalyst recommendations are as follows:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oeycwv7bhad81.png?width=634&format=png&auto=webp&s=0877dbf485def15025d8e8d40b67fc369d80422c\n\nIf you look at the cyclic nature of how SOFI trades, you can see that it is due to another major move up. As can be seen by the chart, SOFI is very oversold, and at a time where the company has never looked stronger.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lnu1d5ekhad81.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb5dc456860e750e0cbb94ccdcd54404d676136c\n\nBears will continue to dump negative on SOFI, but they can't beat the fundamentals. They can't back up their FUD with numbers. So they will then try to sell you on the ever impending market crash. If there was going to be a market crash soon, we would see evidence of that in the debt market. That evidence does not exist. Expect any market correction to be gradual and drawn out over time as the Fed eases inflation.\n\nTLDR: SOFI represents a value proposition and tremendous great growth potential. When fundamentals start to matter again, SOFI is already prepared to meet those expectations.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mtetsuzofad81.png?width=578&format=png&auto=webp&s=c823d5ef741417e54d28f607dcb934a58f4cf943\n\nDisclaimer: This is not financial advice. I'm a small investor that is just sharing my opinion on SOFI. I am currently holding a small number of calls on SOFI expiring 01/28 at $15.00 and $17.50. I plan on buying more calls on Monday if we see any further price decline.\n\nEdit: Added YouTube video link.", "id": "saa6xe", "created_utc": 1642880153.0, "score": 110, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "num_comments": 112, "comments": [{"body": "Your calls expired yesterday amigo.", "score": 88, "replies": [{"body": "Oops, going to fix that... thanks.
