It was not an invasion. It was not sustained destruction of the country over 2 decades. In reality after 9/11 these terrorists could do very little to the west and infact in modern times hijacked aeroplanes could be shot down relatively easily.

Invasion or not, it’s difficult to argue that Afghanistan was not justified. Iraq is much more questionable but unfortunately most Americans didn’t get a choice in either. To your point about airplanes being shot down; they could’ve been shot down that day. They didn’t know what was happening. Fight or fight responses are natural and nobody is going to be quick on the trigger to shoot down a Boeing 737. I have no clue what country you’re from so can’t comment about your countries involvement in the Middle East.\n\nI’m not sure I see what your point is concerning air strikes.

Again 3k people died in the September 11th attacks, but 170k afghans died as a result from that. Less than 50% of the total casualties in Afghanistan were combatants.

You can plug an HDD into the PS5 and play PS4 games, just as you can plug an HDD into the Xbox Series and play Xbox One games. The difference comes in that, the expansion bay for the Xbox is proprietary, while on PS5 it’s just a PCI-E SSD slot. \n\nI’m pretty bummed that the internal storage is onboard on PS5, and so won’t be easily user-repairable like every previous generation of PS, where you could install any HDD off the shelf that fit and get the necessary software directly from Sony. Microsoft’s history with user drive replacement is…. Spotty to say the least. \n\nTo compare the two: \n\n> -PS2: User accessible HDD slot, optional so not many games supported it. Also had memory card slots.\n\n> -Xbox: Internal HDD, supported by all games, but not replaceable. Also had memory card slots, but mostly advertised to bring saves to friends houses.\n\nPoint: Microsoft probably, due to the HDD being built in and thus all games supporting it.\n\nThen we move into the era of standard internal memory, thanks in no small part to the Xbox.\n\n> -PS3: User accessible HDD with off the shelf part, software available free on Sonys site.\n\n> -360: proprietary HDDs, costs way above market values, and if you opt to bust open the shell and replace it yourself anyway, good luck finding firmware unless you’re well versed in Google-Fu. \n\nPoint: Sony, for sure.\n\n> -PS4: user replaceable HDD, software available on Sonys site. Also supports USB expansion\n\n> -Xbox One: aggressively designed to minimize access to drive. Firmware is available! But… your drive must be set up a certain way, and the console won’t do it for you. So, despite being able to get the firmware, you must first  partition and install file system software, installation of which requires running terminal commands due to Microsoft’s esoteric partitioning and file structure. Also supports USB expansion. \n\nPoint: Sony. I worked in electronics repair for a long time, HDDs are comsumable components. They should be treated as such and replacement should be an intended part of the lifecycle. To literally hide the drive inside is peak anti-consumerism and rent seeking behavior. Their intent is to force you to seek service from them or purchase a new console when the drive goes out.\n\n> -PS5: onboard memory, non replaceable. Major bummer, but given the advanced architecture of their internal SSD, I’ll give them a little leeway. Expansion available through off the shelf PCI-E 4 and newer SSDs, which will continue to drop in price organically over the lifespan of the console. USB expansion available for backwards compatibility, but not current generation games.\n\n> -Xbox Series: Non-user replaceable SSD. Not soldered to board, just will not accept a new SSD even if taken from another Series. Not using special teCh necessitating this, using off the shelf parts. Expansion for current generation games available only through proprietary SSD enclosure, which inside of it has an off the shelf part slightly modified to make standard off the shelf parts non-functional. Prices above market value, and will continue to be so likely for some time. USB expansion available for backwards compatibility, and cross generation games.\n\nPoint: Sony, but Microsoft’s software level commitment to backwards compatibility is a thing of wonder, and should not be discounted.

Some of those are stocks that haven't had any fundamental news or earning reports since then. Sure, the macro environment will have a significant impact, but I only invest in companies I believe in long term and I make sure they have significant cash on hand (almost always way more than debt) and are either growing their earnings or have a path to profitability.

The federal government looks increasingly deadlocked, and the Fed is displaying its monolithic tendencies by committing to numerous rate hikes and to monetary tightening in the face of an economic slowdown. The slowdown is apparent in the most recent economic data and in the simple fact that there was a significant consumption binge even during the pandemic despite supply constraints and the resulting high prices. Once the binge cools off, slowdown begins. That time is now.\n\nIt's an easy 20-30% down from here if the Fed carries through with its plan and proceeds with rate hikes in the face of a slowing economy. China has sensed this and warned against excessively tight policy in the West, since any resulting recession will shrink export demand while China itself is struggling economically.\n\nI'd expect the Fed to reverse policy quickly once it realizes its mistake, I would guess after about six months or so.

No\n\nWhat in the world makes you think that?

The question is how hard the government will look at it. \n\n>Antitrust isn’t a subject as this isn’t Data related\n\nDo you think antitrust is only about data? The recent Data/social media antitrust scrutiny is actually a relatively new development that doesn't fit the mould of traditional antitrust that well.  Literally any company in any market can be subject to antitrust scrutiny. I literally just took this class in law school last semester.\n\nMicrosoft fully owns one (Xbox) of 4 major platforms that video games are published in within the US, and de facto control another (PC). They are now acquiring THE largest independent video game maker in the country, who makes some of the biggest cross platform games (CoD), and many of the most popular PC games (WoW, Hearthstone, Diablo). The entire thing is greatly complicated by the fact that Microsoft owns Windows, which is why they are very careful to not step too far into gaming on PC too quickly.\n\nAntitrust potential:\n\n1. Microsoft could make Activision-Blizzard games Xbox exclusives. That's in addition to all the Bethesda games that they just purchased. Does that take too much choice away from consumers about where they get their games? Does it unfairly harm Playstation if you buy out their biggest independent game suppliers? Especially if you can now get CoD and Elder Scrolls on PC and Xbox, maybe WoW gets added to Xbox, but none of it on Playstation?\n\n2. Microsoft could be anticompetitive against other game devs and distributors by pushing Blizzard games and software on PC because they control Windows, the only mainstream gaming platform for PC. Remember when the government sued over IE bundling? Same thing with Battle.net bundling, pushing Blizzard games as bloatware, etc. \n\n3. Microsoft owning literally all of the biggest game franchises and studios in America could have serious anticompetitive effects on the remaining independent game studios, again, by pushing their own products over their competitors. Halo is one franchise that can coexist with many others. Halo+ Elder Scrolls/Fallout/Starfield + CoD + WoW and related content is a very heavy saturation of titles. Priority treatment of all of Microsoft's IP would heavily disadvantage the remaining competition on Xbox and PC depending on how far Microsoft would take it.\n\n*Even if these are settled issues* they will review all possible issues and most likely Microsoft will voluntarily make some concessions to prevent the deal from being blown up or delayed too long.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Keep it simple you are just rewritting what i said and talk about regulations.\n\nEven Today you can’t play Halo on a Playstation, or Mario Kart on a XBOX…this isn’t subject to regulation\n\nXbox and Microsoft OS are two different entities which can’t share Data.\nThis is already clear and regulated…\n\nIt’s no.3 and if the US would block this merger They simply go elsewhere….\n\nYou are mixing a lot up, the situation you are talking about is already regulated and clear different entities can’t transfer Data, there are fines in place this can’t stop a merger.", "score": -2, "replies": [{"body": "1.

And then the day after we see profit taking\n\nSo a few questions to get your opinion\n\n1) I own around 180 shares with average price close to high 900s.   So are you saying I'm best off to just keep holding through all this shorter term macro Volatility or should I be careful and trim shares?  My gut tells me you'd say don't trim shares expecting to time the stock price and come back buying at a higher average price because with taxes and all else considered... Its a losing gamble to trim on precious shares right?\n\n2) Out of my 180 shares, 160 belong to my folks, and I own just 20 myself.  I bought my 20 shares at average of $1004.  So by earnings, I could potentially sell my own 20 shares for a small possible profit of a few thousand bucks... But again, I wonder if your experience tells us I shouldn't touch my 20 shares\n\n3) About earnings...  If someone wanted to take a bit of profits... Meaning playing the \"earnings\" game of (buy the \"rumor\" sell the \"news\")...\nAre you kindly suggesting that just a day or two before the actual earnings call would be the time to consider selling?  Because it sounded like you're saying usually the sell off happens right on the following day right?  Or is it more like... The following day or two the stock will still stay pretty inflated but then like starting the 3rd day is when profit taking occurs?\n\nI guess I'm looking for some bit of education based on your experience... As to how the markets \"play\" Tesla around earnings season?\n\n4) Thank you so much for being so awesome and helpful.  And please don't worry if your earnings per year from your other income streams is crap.  I'm exactly in the same boat and my story is pretty complicated also.   Just as long as you have reasonable health and loved ones around, you'll be fine.  Living within our means and not accruing debt is a very good thing in and of itself I suppose.\n\nBut tell me my dear friend...  When you say you lost 50-60k by being \"greedy\" (which I take to mean as you bring kinda trigger happy in those days)....  Are you saying you lost that hefty sum because you were trying to time the market? Or were you like day trading Tesla? Or like did you panic sell?  I'm just trying to learn like what happened I guess.\n\n5) Finally I'd love to get your thoughts on how low you think Tesla can go this year given all the Weird Macro crap going on, and all the Corona Carnival nonsense and Hysteria?  Some people don't see us dropping below 800 bucks.  What do you think?\n\nThx", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "No problem! My big question is this: what are your end goals/time horizon for selling? Would you sell once you hit a certain amount of profit, or are you trying to stock up for retirement? \n\nPersonally, my mentality is that I will not be considering selling for the next 10 years or even longer (I don't need the money for anything), even if we see a 10x in the price per share (at this point, I would be able to comfortably borrow from my shares if I needed a little money). This mindset informs the way I view the shares I have (right around the same as you; something like 220 shares, though I bought them all at the covid crash + DCA for the last few years so my total amount invested is like 30-40k. \n\nIf I needed the money, or was planning on selling shorter term, I would probably do something different. I probably wouldn't be buying tesla shares with money I may need in the short term future. I see the money I have invested in Tesla as dead to me, completely inaccessible and not able to be sold (as in, I would still be able to live and recoup if Tesla went to 0) \n\n1. (again, because of my 10+ year time horizon) I'm not doing anything other than buying. No trimming or anything for me, because it's impossible to predict where the stock will go this year (though truth of the fundamentals and business practices of tesla will eventually be recognized)\n2. As long as you don't need the money, I would not sell the shares. \n3. Earnings are always such a circus, the stock does all kinds of unpredictable crazy things around this time. The new kicker this time is that Tesla is going to certainly come out with record EPS numbers, it's just a question of what they will be, and how wall st will react to them, as well as any new information released at the earnings call, especially the stuff Elon says.  \n4. I lost money buying shorter term call options before battery day, AI day, and Elon's SNL appearance. Lost big time and had to sell shares to make up for the losses. Battery day and AI day are huge for the business long term, but unfortunately most of wall st is unaware of anything but quarterly profits and P/E ratios. Lastly, I bought calls when the share price dropped AFTER Q4 deliveries came out. Big, ongoing loss. I'd probably have close to 300 shares if I just bought and held patiently! \n5. Off of nothing more than a gut feeling, I could see Tesla going far lower than 800 worse case scenario. Maybe 500-600. The problem is that with panic selling, people stop checking whether businesses are positioned to thrive through a recession or die. Tesla is in a position to thrive. Other OEM's are in a position to die, especially because a second government bailout for GM ain't happening.

At the time I sold 70%+ of my portfolio at 1330$ and I post it here (saying it was for partially buying house) proud of myself for getting 400%+ out of TSLA and saying that TSLA clearly get ahead of itself with the valuation and share price. He reply to me that maybe ETF is the way to go for me as I clearly don't understand growth stock and especially disruptive once like TSLA.\n\nI felt a little bit bashed because hey I got 400%+ out of TSLA which is great in a very short 2 years time frame mainly because I understood that Tesla doesn't have any competition and it will be the EV leader for years to come and that market will finally appreciate it.\n\nWhat I didn't understand that time was that the capacity build out in Shanghai and then in Berlin / Austin is a first step into massive production capacity. They are not some standard 250 000 cars factories from other OEMs. They may look like it in the first year of production ramp, but they are quickly becoming manufacturers behemoths (with 1+ mln capacity, which we see from Shanghai and enormous Austin size and plans for phasez expansion in Berlin) that Volkswagen CEO can only admire and alarming their company what is going on on their doorstep.\n\nWhat I didn't know was also the battery day implication which was September 2020 and I sold in July 2020 if I remember correctly. The Limiting Factor / Gali from Hyperchange cracked mostly it in late August so I was already re-buying higher than before (\\~1500-1600$) and God that hurt and was brutal psychologicly.\n\nNow after 1 year from dip-after battery day (it went \\~400+$ to about 350-330$ if I remember correctly) it was another step of enlightenment for me. It occured to me that Tesla for the first time in history will be valued fairly on the stock market even though it become 5th or 6th the biggest company in the world (in terms of capitalization).\n\nIt were few elements that contributed to this \"enlightenment\". Things like ROIC (return of investments capital) in comparison to Amazon / Google / FB etc., Q3 21' margins and profit which lay down base for calculation of estimates for Q4 21' (somewhere between 2,4-2,8 bln $ of net GAAP profit?) and that leads to enormous P/E (price to earnings) reduction going around 100x and below that if price will stay at 1000-1200$ or calculating the TAM with even 10mln cars in 2030 (although Tesla forecasting 20mln) + Energy (we know about 50GWh factory for Megapacks). Now everything is \"calculable\" and just need to watch the execution. Before it was calculating Free Cash Flow but everybody thought Tesla is permanently loosing money because they were in net GAAP lose and even when they went positive, many analysts / bears still argumented it is because of ZEV credits / European car pooling credits.\n\nThat is why today I can imagine Tesla to be worth about that of Apple today as early as 2024-2025 and that is ONLY by the count of cars they will sell then. Add to that Energy with at least 5-10% positive margin, positive service and others, wildcard with FSD and hype for Cybertruck / 25 000$ car / robotaxi / rapid progress of FSD and wide release.\n\nFrom the time I've realised it finally I don't care that much about macro even if it can play a major role in bashing price of Tesla (along with the broad market).

It's next month not next week.\"\n\nYou are not quoting Elon correctly. With Elon, exact wording is important. Your words quoting Elon: \"It's next month not next week.\" (See above.) Elon's actual words: \"Am headed to Berlin mid Feb, not this week.\" Elon said nothing about riding in a Berlin-produced Tesla, to confirm or deny it. Your misquote \"It's\" implies a confirmation of the details of the visit, but that's not what Elon said - he just said he's going to Berlin in February, not what he will do there. \n\nAnother statement you made in your edited comment: \"He very specifically did not discredit the headline of the article that said he was doing it in the model Y, which is absolutely something he would have done if it was not true.\" I respectfully but strongly disagree. I have been following Elon's activities and statements since maybe 2013, and have encountered a large number of instances in which Elon is presented with a 2-part statement, and he responds only to one part and completely ignores the second part. That used to bother me, at least in cases where the ignored part was clearly false, but I finally arrived at the interpretation that Elon doesn't regard it as his duty to correct all incorrect statements that others make. As Elon actually wrote in the tweet in question, \"I obv can’t comment on every rumor\", which supports my interpretation that not responding to a particular statement does not mean he's confirming it. \n\n> Because if you read what he's responding to and how he responds, it's beyond obvious that this is his trolly way of confirming he will be riding around in a German Model Y in February.\n\nNo, you are jumping to conclusions. You are taking statements other people made, which Elon did not address at all, and you appear to be assuming that since Elon didn't deny it then he must be confirming it, and as I described above, I've seen many counterexamples where he ignored part of a multi-part statement, even if it was not true. The question does arise, since Elon said he can't comment on every rumor, why did he choose to comment on this rumor? You offer one possibility (promotional stunt), but I consider it more likely that Elon wanted to avoid FUD headlines like \"more delays - Elon misses scheduled January meeting in Berlin\". And he likely also does not want to set up the expectation that he will correct any incorrect rumors and that therefore if he doesn't comment then the rumor must be true (again note Elon's words \"I obv can’t comment on every rumor\"), which is again what you seem to be assuming, as indicated in your edited comment \"He very specifically did not discredit the headline\".\n\nAs to the idea of Elon being picked up at the airport in a Berlin-made model Y, I find it interesting because they would not likely have had time to get it fully accredited as street-legal, but I recall that the first working prototype Cybertruck was able to drive on US roads with a company plate that apparently made experimental driving on public roads legal. Maybe Germany has a similar waiver to allow a limited number of experimental vehicles on the road. And it would be a nice publicity stunt. So I keep an open mind that the Berlin-made Model Y might happen, but again Elon didn't say anything about that on Twitter.\n\n> since typically your responses here are thorough out and appear well educated\n\nThanks for the compliment, though of course you didn't mean it for this particular comment. I also enjoy and respect most of your comments.\n\n> You lost my respect today, sol3todol4.\n\nAs I said, tempers tend to flare on down days, and it's certainly rotten to get a lot of downvotes. I think you may also be overreacting. Suggest you carefully read the exchange, the referenced article, and also the Torque News article that the referenced article links to. The things you attributed to Elon came from other people, the \"sources\" may turn out to be right though getting the date wrong doesn't help their credibility right now, and Elon did not confirm them and even called the whole thing \"rumor\".", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Unbelievable.

Second of all, if they posted an article \"Elon musk to give a million dollars to charity with Joe Rogan next week\" and Elon responded \"Not true. I'm going on Rogan mid Feb not next week\" then Elon's giving a million+ to charity... In a month. This is beyond obvious.

Am headed to Berlin mid Feb, not this week.\"\n\nYour line of reasoning in your edited version of your original post: \"Drive Tesla said that Elon would be touring Berlin in a German produced Model Y in a week, and Elon responded that he would not be responding that it was in a month not next week. He very specifically did not discredit the headline of the article that said he was doing it in the model Y, which is absolutely something he would have done if it was not true.\"\n\nThat's your interpretation, in other words a guess. And yet you wrote (your edited version): \"Elon just posted on Twitter that he will be touring Berlin in a Berlin produced Model Y Tesla next month.\" Elon did not post that on Twitter, that's your guess at what he meant. And no matter how many times you write about what Elon \"absolutely would have done\" and how it's \"beyond obvious\", it's still your guess.\n\nIn tracking the status of Tesla and its future plans, comments from company insiders can be useful, but actual words from Elon are a treasured prize. A guess from KolariKid about what Elon meant is just not as valuable as words from Elon, and if you take your guess and try to present it as words from Elon, then that's not correct, and it's entirely reasonable to point out that it's not correct, here in the TIC forum, where we are trying to figure out Elon's words.\n\nAs to your observation in your edited original post, \"He very specifically did not discredit the headline of the article that said he was doing it in the model Y\", Elon actually did categorize it as a rumor, and explicitly wrote \"this isn't true\". That sure sounds like discrediting to me. Your position that saying it isn't true actually means it is true is your guess, not something that Elon physically wrote.\n\nIf I were in Elon's position and wanted to communicate what you think he's trying to communicate, I would have written \"the date is wrong - the Model Y ride will be in February, not January.  I would not have called it a rumor and said it isn't true, and then in a second sentence mention a planned Berlin visit that might or might not be related to the rumor.

Some gems from the report.\n\nThe market is a maniac and because we are net buyers of shares over the rest of our lifetime, we welcome stress in markets. While we focus our energy on understanding individual businesses, we make zero effort to manage volatility or perform some pseudo risk management like hedging ownership of businesses, something that some market participants merely do to justify higher fees.\n\nMacroeconomic talk is an interesting intellectual exercise yet is does not help in achieving good investment returns. There is no monolithic economy, stock market or sector. While most businesses share some aspects with others there is a unique nature to most. Most market participants have a horizon of days, maybe months, and are concentrating all IQ and compute power on trying to guestimate near-term swings. That seems a zero-sum game to us for most. The gloomier and scarier the crowd is the more attractive investment opportunities there are. Today, the ghost of higher inflation and interest rates is scaring many out of valuable positions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe fundamental investor can find ‘venture’ returns in the public market.\n\nInvestment opportunities in the public market remain underappreciated versus the private market. The biggest investment gains come when growth of the business continues for much longer than the market is willing to assume, e.g., Alphabet, Microsoft, and Amazon.\n\nBelow statement clearly applies to Tesla.\n\nThe quality of the business is far more important than the valuation and the biggest driver of quality is culture. This is something the equity investor must learn from the best venture investors. While money is a commodity, talent is scarce and plenty of companies are not able to attract the right people no matter how big their budget is. The best engineers like to work at inspiring places that are trying to solve hard, important problems. The amount of talent that is being attracted by the tech sector is impressive and the pipeline of stunning  businesses that at some point may start their public life is interesting.", "score": 11, "replies": []}, {"body": "Elon- “People do not yet understand how valuable an autonomous vehicle will be”", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "People really have no clue", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "I hope they remain clueless and all of the tendies are OURS.", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Chairs are under appreciated", "score": 4, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Does Elon talking about population collapse threat make you think about having more kids?\n\nOn a personal note, wife and I always thought we’d have 2-3 kids.

{"title": "Meme stocks are shorts", "selftext": "Here's the real, non-echo chamber take from someone who actually knows what they're talking about. So many echo chamber-deluded apes spit out all of these qualitative factors to claim that these meme stocks are a buy, e.g. \"NFTS!\" or \"they restructured their leases!\" or \"they have a lot of cash now so they're not going bankrupt!\" This is nonsense - a company doesn't have to go bankrupt for you to lose a massive amount of money.\n\n**Intrinsic Value: about $5 per share:** A company's intrinsic value is the present value of its future cash flows. While the market valuation of a public company can gyrate wildly around this intrinsic value in the short term, history shows us that companies' share prices will always ultimately return to this true fair price. The problem with this \"present value of future cash flows\" calculation is it's too theoretical and subjective to be meaningful, and putting forth projections here would leave me susceptible to all kinds of uneducated retorts. However, earnings multiples are a useful shorthand tool for rough valuation analysis when used in the context of other public companies' similar metrics. \n\nLet's say hypothetically that AMC stock drops about 50%, to $10 per share. This would give AMC a market cap of about $5B, which would put its enterprise value at roughly $14B. Wall street believes that AMC will generate about $435M (consensus) of EBITDA next year. This means that at this hypothetical $10 per share, or $14B of enterprise value, AMC would be trading at 32 times next year's EBITDA. Turns out, that is exactly the same EV/EBITDA multiple that Enphase (ENPH) currently trades at - and Enphase is a phenomenal business with solid IP, a wide moat, market share leadership, and phenomenal earnings power in a super high-growth, underpenetrated market (resi/commercial solar) - all of which are extremely attractive investment features (none of which are encompassed by AMC). I promise you, even at $10 per share (32X EBITDA), AMC would still be far overvalued. AMC's closest publicly traded peer, Cineplex, trades at about 8x 2022 EBITDA (imperfect, I know). \n\nIn reality, AMC is probably worth closer to $5 per share. I say this because just prior to COVID hitting, AMC was hanging out in the $7ish range, and it's a reasonably conservative to assume that the equity is worth 25% less than it was pre-COVID. Why do I say it's worth 25% less than it was pre-COVID? Because I'm assuming the massive shift towards at-home streaming (see NFLX, Disney+, etc. subscriber growth surge) permanently impaired AMC's future attendance by 25% (probably conservative). The $2.5B permanent impairment charge they took against goodwill and intangibles in 2020 provides support for this assumption: that impairment chargewas about 25% of their pre-impairment total asset balance. This is the company secretly admitting the future of their business is 25% more bleak than it was before COVID.\n\nIt's totally fine to be an ape and buy the stock in solidarity with your ape brethren and because you believe there will be a short squeeze, but don't fool yourself into believing you hold the stock based on fundamentals.\n\nOn the topic of that short squeeze - it's not gonna happen, and there is no mass hedgie conspiracy against the apes. I work as an investment analyst at a long/short equity hedge fund and I promise you that the short interest you see on yahoo finance is in fact pretty close to the real number. I have confirmed with multiple major wall street brokers (think Goldman, Morgan Stanley, etc.) that there are plenty of shares available to borrow, and the interest rate is about what i would expect for a stock with roughly 20% short interest.\n\nAnother way to think about the viability of a conspiracy theory like this is to think about what would motivate the alleged conspirers to engage in this type of scheme. In the hedge fund world, everyone is motivated by getting a fat year-end bonus. As an industry, we get paid our year-end bonus when the fund as a whole outperforms its benchmark (for example, benchmark might be the S&P 500). Typically the bonus payment is 20% of excess return... e.g. if if my fund had $1B of assets under management, and we returned 30% last year vs. the S&P's 20% return, our bonus payment would be (30%-20%) x $1B x our 20% take = $20m of bonus pool to be split amongst the investment professionals, back office people, etc. $1B of assets at a single-portfolio manager hedge fund can easily be handled by 5 to 10 total staff, so you can see how the economics on a per-person basis can be quite motivating.\n\nNow, this is a double edged sword, and this is where AMC/GME come into play. There is something called a high water mark. If a hedge fund underperforms their benchmark, they would not get a bonus payment for the year, and they will never get another bonus payment until they recoup that underperformance (and tack on additional outperformance). If it seems hopeless for a fund to ever make up that shortfall, the fund will usually shut down - brain drain is inevitable at this point, as talented investment professionals will jump to another fund where the possibility of a fat bonus is on the table. Now, imagine what being short AMC last year and not exiting prior to year end would do to a fund - the stock rose roughly 13x from beginning to end of the year. Even if that was a hypothetical small 3% of the portfolio, that 3% position losing 1300% would create about a ~40% loss for the fund as a whole. That fund would shut down, guaranteed (e.g. Melvin capital) - no one sticks around at a fund that's down that much - the likelihood of ever getting a year-end bonus again is too slim. The majority of people I know at other funds who were shorting the stock for fundamental reasons prior to the WSB meme stock movement got out long before the big price spike in May - prior to that surge, the stock was already up roughly 5x from the beginning of the year, which is far too large of a loss to stomach for a hedge fund already.\n\n**TLDR:** AMC is \"fundamentally\" worth <$5 per share, and no squeeze is coming.", "id": "s77vpg", "created_utc": 1642539955.0, "score": 41, "upvote_ratio": 0.62, "num_comments": 105, "comments": [{"body": "Apes can’t read", "score": 28, "replies": [{"body": "I don't know what this says but it made me angry", "score": 15, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "This FUD has too much logic in it for wsb.", "score": 52, "replies": [{"body": "Well played, I see what you did there 😂", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Agree", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I'm not reading all that shit.

For example, with ZM/Pton/DOCU/ etc, these algos picked up on the fact that the market was loving these stocks and was starting to buy stocks of all Covid winners on a favorable earnings release from another unrelated Covid winner…and that drove an exploitable inefficiency… by quickly buying (high-frequency trading) all Covid winner stocks when, for example, PTON had a good quarter, the algos stand to profit from other human participants inevitably buying some shares of unrelated Covid winners as well. This is exactly what’s happening with the meme stocks; the algos picked up early on that the meme stocks like GME, AMC, BB, etc all started to rip on retail euphoria, the model quickly adjusted to buy and sell shares of all meme stocks based on movements in other meme stocks. What this does after a long time of this pattern continuing (and more algo capital piling in) is essentially exploits  the similarity to such an extent that it actually exaggerates the similarity - and as long as it continues ti be profitable for the algos (ie as long as retail investors keep piling into these stocks when they go up and selling when they go down), this will continue to be practically free money for the algos.

In my opinion, the most relevant real rate to use when it comes to impact on equities would be taking the 10 year rate on investment-grade corporate bonds and subtracting out the 10 year breakeven inflation expectation. The reason I think this is the best way to look at it (for evaluating impact on equities) is two-fold: (1) corporate bonds are the true alternative to equities - investors aren't typically deciding whether to invest in stocks or treasuries, it's a decision of whether to invest in a company via stock or via bonds; and (2) there is a very strong historical negative correlation between this real rate and unprofitable tech stocks (e.g. ARKK holdings). Pretty much every time this rate goes up, unprofitable tech stocks/meme stocks go down, and vice versa.

He owns too much of GME for selling right now to even make economic sense. He owns, I think, 12% of the company (not at my terminal). That’s about a $1B of total ownership. Now, GME on an average day trades about $300m worth of shares (daily volume about 300k shares x ~$100 stock price currently. That means, in order for cohen to dump his shares, he’d have to do it fairly slowly… with a stock that trades $300mm a day, trying to sell even $30m in a single day on the open market is risky, it would push the market price down too much.  But say for the sake of argument he did sell $30m in a day - great, $30m sold, only $970 million left to unload! The problem is, he has to notify the market via form 4 that he has sold stock. What do you think it would do to GME’s stock price if that news came out? Pretend it makes GME go down 10%, which is definitely conservative. Suddenly, that $30m he sold just cost him $97m of net worth (his remaining shares lost 10% of their value). That sucks, he says in this hypothetical scenario… but then he says f it, I’m gonna sell another $30m of shares.. sends the stock down another 10%, destroys more value for him than it creates once again, rinse and repeat.
