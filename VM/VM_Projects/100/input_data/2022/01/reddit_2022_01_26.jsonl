In addition they are building bases in Africa and have used their belt and road program to build ports in places like Sri Lanka which they then reposesed once the Sri Lankan government defaulted on the loans and are now using to refuel warships among other purposes.\n\nFinally their general rhetoric under Xi has become much more belligerent even towards small nations like Latvia, where they are now trying to impose economic sanctions on them (and trying to pressure other countries to follow) just for normalizing relations with Taiwan a little further.\n\nCooperation may be more profitable for more people in a rational world, but we are not living in a 100% rational world and especially in countries like China where the nation is ran by a single party dictatorship things become skewed where if the leadership propaganda can convince the country it is better for *them* to take from others you can easily end up in another war, just see what is happening between Russia and Ukraine right now.", "score": 48, "replies": [{"body": "I think it was this one:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/RO3izbn201s\n\nI’d love you hear your thoughts.

I don't necessarily disagree with anything he said and it is correct that China does have a (by a fairly sizable amount now) larger economy if you measure GDP adjusted by Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) rather than just nominally GDP. That's pretty important as it means in real terms China is producing much more than the US now.\n\n\nHowever, he never states that China has an aversion to Imperialism. He says that the CCP (and China as a whole) sees itself as turning around from the humiliation of the late 1800's and early 1900's to becoming a strong and respected power again. Yes they do hate that imperialist era but it is more that they were on the wrong end of it, and if you ever look at the comment sections of Chinese news or Social Media there is definitely a feeling that it is now \"their turn\". The speaker actually alludes to that by saying that if anything the CCP has actually put a lid on Chinese nationalism on the global stage but increasingly you can see the party and especially leaders like Xi play into that nationalism (for example see how the CCP blamed Omicron showing up in China on a letter from Canada and how many Chinese on social media started attacking the country). See also how he said that every single Chinese person he's talked to believes without a doubt that the US intentionally bombed the Chinese embassy in Belgrade. He trys to point to the lack of overseas adventures in Chinese history to say they won't be militarily aggressive but to me that falls flat as overseas empires are actually the exception, not the rule, for Imperialism. Places like China and Russia have been empires for centuries but they traditionally preyed on their neighbors as it was normally easier to do so. There were very unique conditions in Europe and the world (technological and population growth and th disparity in them between Europe and the rest of the world) during the 1600's - 1800's made overseas empires more logical for the European powers.\n\n\nAdditionally the speaker is mostly talking about what the US should do before China is number 1 in nominal terms (understandably since it is at a US university), and here he is basically reiterating over and over to not give China any justification for things. At one point he even says that if the US doesn't stop the freedom of navigation cruises (which I might add are totally legal and done to support Taiwan and other countries' claims in the South China Sea) to expect Chinese warships to be patrolling off the coast of California in 20 years as a response.\n\n\nFinally, and this is important, the speaker is using the past 30 years of US-Chinese relations to predict the future of those relations when the relationship is clearly undergoing a pivot *right now*. He talks of the deference of the Chinese leadership to America during that time but it is also clear that China is becoming increasingly independent and agressive for its own agendas. That falls perfectly in line with what I have read has been the strategy that the Chinese leadership laid out even in the 1980's, which was to be deferential and work with the West as they needed the money, growth, and power that came with exporting so many goods to us, but then eventually once they became powerful enough to pivot to their own agendas and what they really wanted to do. Now that China is clearly #1 or close to it and their economy is pivoting more towards Africa and domestic trade within China rather than exports to the West the leadership's behavior and rhetoric is changing accordingly.", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "omg thanks thanks thanks! \n\ni love these types of discussions. give me a bit of time to read and digest.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "exactly except the culture part, USA will change over time, China will stay the same, and more now since they are banning more and more USA movies and even changing their endings to fit the country.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "China is changing too. just like in the west, Change happens over generations\n\nI think it’s interesting to remember china’s priority is stability\n\nIt is the US coalition that has focused on actively destabilizing the rest of the world to thwart their rise for longer than I have been alive.", "score": 0, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "ok, you win\n\ncongrats", "score": 8, "replies": []}, {"body": "No YOU!

When you pick funds, you are choosing based on the competence and past performance of the fund management firms and based on how well each fund's specific strategy matches your investment goals.  There are metrics that you can look at (like beta) that show how well each fund performs relative to a benchmark (which could be the SPX).  With stocks, you need to do a lot more work to estimate the intrinsic value of a company in order to determine if it's a good buy at current prices, and there are far more stocks to look at.  There are information services that give you tools that you can use to search for funds based on your criteria and investment goals (I use morningstar, but there are several others), so I'd say it's easier to find and filter through transparent information on funds.\n\nMore importantly, though, funds give you access to industries and markets that you might otherwise find difficult or impossible to access directly, so you can select types of funds that suit your specific needs without needing to be an expert analyst.  There are funds that concentrate on the Japanese market, for example, which right now might be a good place to store some of your wealth because it does not appear to be so overleveraged like the US market is right now. There are funds that concentrate on emerging markets, which may experience strong growth in the near future.  There are funds that are short the market, which might be a good hedge in case the market turns bearish.

Give the slightest critique and you'll be called spreading FUD, not knowing anything while you gave a list of arguments and the only reply is \"no\" or wanting to lower the price for a better entry point (yes, when I called out fraudulent behavior of a CEO pumping their own stock twice in the past and having a company name change, this was the response. Needless to say, the stock crashed again).\n\nBut what caused the shift in general, why is PE now useless or is it even useless? Let's travel back a bit in time.\n\nThe stock market has been around for a very long time, and a century ago the biggest issue for a company was to survive. Which also means for any investor that those struggling to survive are a risk, a gamble. But more importantly, the entire thing was more limited to big time players. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying it had no one who didn't put their weekly salary right into it with a bit of bucks, but it wasn't at the scale of \"tap an icon and you bought it\". Another common or more successful method was to take whatever value the company currently has and finding underpriced stocks. Technically speaking if you own all of the stock or a majority, you could liquidate the company and take home their value, meaning if you bought it for 2 million but value is at 3 million, that's a huge win and security back up. \n\nNow, I don't think it's necessary to say how much this shifted - though I'm not pretending some similar levels of gambling already existed. I'm rather saying a lot of the principles that had a higher impact in the past are now way less relevant simply due to the increase of all the other aspects, especially \"potential\".\n\nA company losing money for years would've been gone back then. Now it's any new tech company. The same companies would've been ignored by everyone, now it's Gamestop and AMC. And so on and so on.\n\nThe simple fact is that stock prices are illusive. In theory, you could put any price on any stock. Say you trade after hours with little traffic and sell a stock 200% above  or 75% below the last sale price and someone buys it. That's now the price shown. Not because that's the perceived value or a set in stone value, but because someone got lucky and another was careless or stupid.\n\nThe better an economy is doing, the more you will see this behavior of de-railing from \"real\" value. The worse an economy is doing, the closer a stock value is to a companies actual value. And since these cycles are not set in stone but rely on many factors it's hard to predict or reliable evaluate anything.\n\nTake Tesla. It's value is still a shitload beyond most other running companies, yet they reached the top. How? Well, all that was said previously to an extreme. Take a cult like following in combinations with a high economy drive and add a ton of people starting trading thanks to easily accessible platforms like Robinhood and it gets wild.\n\nAnd that's it. Let's see what will happen 22/23 and possibly even into 24. I don't think we will ever again return to the times 100 years ago, but value investing is still the most reliable, not profitable, investment. And that's all that matters.\n\n10% on $10000 per year for 50 years results in $1.2 million.

{"title": "Bad Apple: Why AAPL is Heavily Overvalued", "selftext": "Let me first start by saying AAPL is a tremendous company with an incredibly strong present and future - contrary to the title. They make great products and are constantly looking to innovate. If you are an investor I believe you will likely see strong returns over a longer time horizon.\n\nRight now however, AAPL is overvalued in my opinion.\n\nLet's observe the last 4 years of revenue:\n\n* 2018 = $266B\n* 2019 = $260B\n* 2020 = $275B\n* **2021 = $366B**\n\nOne of these things is not like the other. As you can see, prior to 2021 we saw relatively stable growth, and then BOOM 33%. On the surface this looks great! But let's get into why this has me worried.\n\nI'm a health insurance actuary and in our world we recognize a phenomenon call a benefit **RUSH-CRUSH-HUSH.** This occurs when there are **plan design changes**.\n\n**RUSH**\n\nWhen a new benefit is added, or there is a significant benefit increase beyond what we would typically observe. People **RUSH** to use the new benefits as they get new glasses, get their cavities filled, and get that procedure they've been holding off on in anticipation of the benefit increase.\n\n**CRUSH**\n\nThe next year there is nothing to spend money on. Everyone already got their new glasses, teeth are filled, and that procedure they got fixed whatever health issue they had. The inflated spending experience a **CRUSH.**\n\n**HUSH**\n\n2-years after the plan change this volatility will **HUSH.** We will observe that claiming returns to a level that we would typically expect, but since the prior year was a CRUSH, the year-over-year increase appears more severe than expected. This would catch a layman off guard, but a well informed actuary would understand that benefits are simply returning back to a reasonable level.\n\nIn the case of AAPL. The plan design change is the pandemic. People weren't spending money on restaurants, bars, travel, concerts, sports, etc. so they had more dollars to allocate to updating their gadgets (**RUSH**). In 2022, people will have already updated their gadgets so there is no need to go out and purchase more. Add to this that the world is expected to reopen, so more dollars will be allocated to other things mentioned above (**CRUSH**). In 2023, I would expect spending to return to a more routine level, some people will update their gadgets while others will hold off another year (HUSH).\n\nEssentially what I'm expecting is that AAPL will have a down year, worse than expected (because of **CRUSH**). This will cause people to over-sell which is where the buying opportunity comes in because in the **HUSH** phase, we know that spending will return to normal. It will appear to be strong growth but in reality it is simply just reverting to the mean.\n\nI read the annual report to look at the components of AAPL's revenue. I would expect that wearables, home, accessories and services continue to grow at a strong pace since those are newer products that are growing organically compared to the iPhone, iPad, and Mac. However, iPhone, iPad and Mac saw a combined 36% YoY increase and they account for 71% of revenue. There is a chance that the market prices all this in but the point of this piece of writing is to inform you that these changes are typically more exaggerated than intuition expects. With a PE of 28.5 the market expects growth, and if AAPL instead sees a reduction in revenue the market will overreact, this is when the buying opportunity arises and you ride the HUSH to glory!\n\nWould love to see your thoughts below.

So while you are analyzing the growth of total revenue, you should be looking at the growth of revenue per share and earnings per share. That is, if you are comparing revenues to Apple's stock price.\n\nSecondly, not every $ sold is valued the same. As an owner of a company you shouldn't focus solely on the top line *(=Revenue)* but rather on what's left for you once everything is paid *(=Net Income/FCF depending on your angle)*. In Apple's case, the revenue stream that is growing the fastest is Services. And because their gross margins on Services is somewhere around 70% while it is around 35% for Products, every Service revenue $ is double as valuable (compared to Products). This is the same phenomenon we are seeing with Amazon and their AWS cloud segment which is highly more profitable than the E-Commerce side.\n\nThere are naturally other factors in play, such as interest rates (*desperate need to find returns on this newly available piles of cash causing multiple expansion*), politics (*Right-to-repair & limiting the power of Tech giants*) but I haven't investigated Apple deeply enough to chip in on those issues.\n\nIn conclusion, Apple (along with other tech giants) have witnessed huge multiple (P/S, P/E etc.) expansions during the last few years and could very easily be overvalued.

Unless massive buyback growth was priced in 5 yr ago (if that's what we are comparing the current price to) the share price should grow by the amount of share buybacks every year. This is just a way for them to return money to shareholders in a tax effective way instead of paying dividends.\n\nLet me explain: If we would assume that everything else (earnings, multiples, sales mix, market conditions, interest rate) stayed the same (and this came as no surprise to market) but during the last 5 years Apple has bought back 50% of their shares, their stock price should have risen by 100% since the share of earnings has doubled. \n\nThis is also assuming that Apple bought them back at an average valuation. \n\nIf they bought them while the market was pricing the stock cheaper, it created more value and the stock price should have risen more than 100%. If they bought them back at expensive valuation compared to current situation, this would have destroyed value and the stock price should have risen less than 100%.\n\nShare buybacks have definitely had impact on Apple's stock price.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Apple Cash cows so hard that it will be enough to offset lack of growth probably.

The Federal Reserve is responsible for the rates specifics and the Government is responsible for the overall economy so keep that in mind. They are doing whats best for the economy and in turn whats best for their jobs. They only cut supply off because of inflation. If the supply chain was stronger, the Fed would never have raised rates. It is in their best interest for a steady growth in the stock market with as little inflation as possible without deflation.

The FOMC reaffirmed Wednesday that it will wrap up that process in early March, meaning the first pandemic-era rate hike could be coming in six weeks.\n\n> Looking ahead, the FOMC released a document detailing “principles” for how it may — down the line — actively shrink its asset holdings, noting that such a process would “commence after the process of increasing the target range for the federal funds rate has begun.”\n\n> The statement suggests the Fed would allow maturing assets to roll off of its balance sheet, with a bias toward holding “primarily Treasury securities” (as opposed to the agency mortgage-backed securities it has also accumulated since the pandemic began).\n\n> “The Committee is prepared to adjust any of the details of its approach to reducing the size of the balance sheet in light of economic and financial developments,” the Fed statement reads.\n\n> The decision to hold rates at near zero in Wednesday’s meeting was unanimously agreed upon by the FOMC’s voting members.\n\n> https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fed-fomc-monetary-policy-decision-january-2022-140443689.html\n\nAny comments made that break our rules, including any sort of trolling and harassment, will be removed and you could face a ban.

{"title": "A crash course on what changing the US bond rate means: an important factor for US and global markets and economies!", "selftext": "**What are bonds**\n\nFirst, an introduction on what bonds actually are.\n\nSimply  put, a bond is the \"asset side\" of governmental or corporate debt. When  a government or corporation borrows money, the borrower now holds a  liability, and the lender holds an asset, which is expected to return  them their original investment (the money they lent) plus profit  (interest) at some later date. A bond is basically a token that says  some government or company owes you some amount of principal by some  date known as the maturity date (usually 3 months to 30 years, depending  on the type of bond), plus interest. Because bonds are a tokenization  of debt, they can be easily traded in a liquid, open market, just like  stocks. This means that the original lender does not need to be the  person who is repaid when the bond matures; the repayment and interest  simply goes to whomever holds the bond at the time.\n\nThere are two main types of bonds: corporate bonds, and government bonds.\n\nCorporate bonds are the main way companies raise money, apart from selling shares.\n\nGovernment  bonds are how the government raises money to cover budget deficits (ie:  when the government spends more than they have the tax revenue to  spend, they borrow the remainder by selling bonds to whomever will buy  them). If nobody is buying the government bonds, the interest will go up  organically due to supply and demand until people are willing to buy  them. Government bonds are often known as **treasuries**,  and are broken down into three categories: treasury bills (short-term  maturity), treasury notes (mid-term maturity), and treasury bonds  (long-term maturity).\n\nOne of the  main buyers of US government bonds is the Federal Reserve, which is the  name of America's central bank. This is the entity that is able to  actually print US dollars. Everyone has heard of things like how the US  government recently ran huge deficits due to \"stimulus spending\", and  that it printed the money it needed for that spending. Well, this is a  slightly inaccurate picture of how it works. The government chooses  fiscal policy, which means they build the budget and they set the tax  rates. They are the ones who choose to overspend and run a deficit.  However, they don't choose monetary policy: they cannot print money.  This power was delegated by congress to the Federal Reserve over 100  years ago.\n\nSo, when the government  runs a deficit, they sell bonds to borrow the money. If the FED chooses  to, it can print a whole bunch of money and then lend that money to the  government (ie: the taxpayer) by buying the government bonds with it.  That is how newly printed money actually gets into the economy: the FED  prints it and then lends it out to companies and to the government by  buying corporate and government bonds. When the FED buys a bunch of  treasuries (government bonds), it is really lending out freshly-printed  cash to the American people (since the government's liabilities are  really the taxpayers' liabilities), and the people then owe that money,  with interest, back to the FED by the time the treasury matures.\n\nWhen  the FED decides to buy up the government's bonds in order to lend to  the taxpayers the money that congress is spending, they are also putting  downward pressure on the bond interest rate. This is because, if the  FED decided *not* to lend a bunch  of money to the government to cover its deficits, the bond interest  would organically rise through supply & demand until other buyers  (individuals, companies, foreign investors, whatever) are willing to buy  those bonds.\n\nSo, when the FED  wants to keep bond interest low, they achieve this indirectly by  creating what is basically artificial demand for US bonds by buying a  ton of them with money that they printed at no cost to themselves. Due  to how supply & demand works with debt, the more demand there is for  bonds, the lower the interest those bonds offer.\n\nSo,  the Federal Reserve executes its main task of managing the US bond rate  by choosing how much government debt it buys. If they want bond rates  to go up, they will print less cash and buy fewer bonds. If they want it  to go down, they will print more cash and buy more bonds.\n\nThe  FED is essentially a whale with the power to print money, who uses said  printed money to manipulate the US bond market, ostensibly for the good  of everybody.\n\n**The risk-free rate**\n\nThe  interest rate on American government bonds is considered one of the  most important variables in the American (and even worldwide) economy.  This is because the American gov is considered the de-facto safest  borrower of all borrowers in the world. In other words, if I buy an  American government bond, I am lending my money to the entity that is  considered to have the smallest risk of defaulting in the world (maybe  this is arguable, but regardless this is a premise that is at the core  of the world economy; what's important is that people believe it).\n\nThere  is a concept in economics called the \"risk-free rate\". This is the  interest you can get for lending your money to a 0-risk borrower, and  should logically be the lowest interest rate you see anywhere in that  economy. Of course, there is always technically some risk when you lend  money, so the risk-free rate is technically imaginary. However, in  practice, just about everybody considers the US bond rate (specifically,  treasury bills, the US bond with the shortest maturity) to be the  risk-free rate, as the risk is considered to be so low as to be  negligible.\n\nSo, if buying American  gov bonds is the safest way to lend money, it means that every single  other form of loan must pay higher interest. Why? Because every other  borrower is considered higher risk, and for me as a lender, I will not  accept less interest for greater risk. So, if American bond interest  goes up, all other loan interest (corporate bonds, bank loans,  mortgages, credit cards, whatever) will organically go up, because  everything must pay greater interest than American bonds to compensate  for greater risk. This is simply a matter of supply & demand  mechanics.\n\nSo, American bond  interest is kind of like the baseline or the \"sea level\" for all  interest rates in the entire economy. This even stretches to other  countries, because anyone can buy a bond from the US gov, and they are  considered the safest borrower in the world, so nobody will ever lend  money to anybody else unless they are compensated with greater interest  than US bond interest.\n\n**The cost of capital**\n\nSo,  if US bond rates go up, and therefore all interest in the economy goes  up, that means money itself has gotten more expensive. Loan interest is  literally just the cost of money (known as the cost of capital). The  lesser the interest, the cheaper it is for me to acquire money right  now. When you realize that the entire world runs mainly on debt, it  becomes clear how significant this phenomenon is.\n\nSo,  when US bond rates go up, the price of capital itself goes up. That  means it becomes more costly for businesses to raise money, more costly  to mortgage a house, more costly to open a line of credit to buy  investments, more costly to spend with credit cards, more costly to use  leverage in securities markets, etc.\n\nThis  means that growth goes down, spending goes down, wages go down, etc. It  also means the prices of goods go down (or at least climb slower),  because people aren't willing to pay as much, since capital itself is  more expensive to acquire.\n\nWhat  happens when prices go down? Well, that's a reduction in inflation. So,  when inflation is getting too high, the FED (central bank) will make  bond interest go up to apply recessive forces on the economy to curb  said inflation.\n\nIf inflation is  low, the FED might reduce bond interest in order to make the cost of  capital lower to juice the economy, prop up securities markets, and  incentivize growth. Too much growth though, and we end up with inflation  again, meaning the FED might increase rates again. This causes a sort  of wave-like dance between bond rates and the heat of the economy.\n\nSo,  the FED influences bond rates ostensibly to keep the economy balanced:  not too hot and inflationary (can be very bad) and not too cold and  deflationary (also can be very bad).\n\nIt  is also worth noting that the FED wields a couple other levers it can  use to increase or decrease the cost of capital (ie: the general  interest rates in the economy) that are separate from bond rates. They  can change the reserve requirements of banks (what percentage of total  assets a bank must hold in reserve). If banks need to hold more in  reserve, then they have less liquid money to lend out, so the supply of  capital goes down, so market interest (cost of capital) rises. Also, the  FED can change the discount rate, which is the amount of interest they  charge banks for short-term loans (24 hours or less) from the FED  itself.  When these rates go up, banks are disincentivized from  borrowing from the FED, so the banks end up with less liquid capital,  which means they need to be more conservative about the loans they  themselves give out, which makes the supply of capital go down and thus  the cost of capital go up.\n\n**What does this mean for markets?**\n\nWhen  bond rates go up, most investment markets go down. Why? Well, the  higher bond rates go, the more I can make by investing in bonds, without  the risk going up. So, as bond rates go up, it becomes more and more  attractive to move my wealth out of riskier markets like stocks and into  what is considered the safest investment market in the world: US bonds.  Since rates going up means I get greater returns on my bond  investments, but the risk doesn't change, US gov bonds become more and  more sensible to an investor as the rates increase.\n\nOf  course, bonds rates going up a smidgen doesn't actually suddenly make  bonds a strategically more sound investment than riskier things like  stocks. In fact, US bond rates have been so comically low for so long  that it hasn't made much sense to buy bonds in years (decades, really).  However, when people hear that the FED is going to increase bond rates,  they think \"bond rates going up means people will sell stocks to buy  bonds, so I better sell now to front-run that\", which is the main thing  that *actually* causes stocks to fall when bond rates increase.\n\n**Some historical context**\n\nUS  bond rates hit an ATH in 1981 around 15% (edit: some sources seem to  say 20%; unsure which is correct). Unsurprisingly, the stock market hit a  low at the same time (like I said before, the orthodox narrative is  that there is an inverse relationship between bond rates and most  securities markets). Think about how ridiculous 15% bond rates are. That  would mean you could buy what is definitionally the safest investment  available and get 15% returns each year. By contrast, the safest stock  ETFs (still way riskier than US bonds) average like 7% a year.\n\nSo,  in the 80s, you could double your money every 5 years while accepting  what is usually considered 0 risk. Ever wonder why boomers seemed to get  wealthy so easily? This is one of the reasons.\n\nSince  the ATH in 1981, the treasury bond rate has fallen continuously until  Covid hit, at which point it pivoted at a low of about 0.5%. Since then,  it has been going back up, but is still extremely low, at around 1.5%.\n\nSince  bond rates going down means stocks go up (at least, this is a very  popular narrative, though some disagree), the stock market has been in a  tremendous and arguably unnatural bull run for about 40 years, only  pausing twice very briefly for \"corrections\" circa 1999 and 2008.\n\nSince  US bond rates have gotten so close to 0%, they can't really lower them  any further without going negative (which is actually a thing, and some  countries are trying negative interest now. This is an extremely weird  rabbit hole that nobody really knows the true consequences of yet.  Imagine getting paid to borrow money. Several countries have been  experimenting with this over the last 7 years, and a few I believe for  even longer). The chair of the FED (Jerome Powell) said a few months  back that they have no intention of going to negative interest rates, so  that means these past 40 years of propping up markets by reducing bond  rates has probably come to an end.\n\nYou  could think of the continuous lowering of rates for the last 40 years  as the FED spending its ammunition to prop up markets and propel  economic growth, but now that rates are barely above 0% and the FED  isn't willing to go negative, they are out of ammo. Not only are they  out of ammo when it comes to lowering the rates, but one might also  argue they are also currently incentivized to *increase* rates to combat rising inflation.\n\nThis  is why there is fear. The FED has been sticking its hands in for 40  years to prop up markets, and now it seems they are going to stop, at  least for now.\n\nI hope this ~~ELI5~~ ~~ELI12~~  ELI-an-Intro-to-Econ student about why US gov bond rates are such an  important concept for understanding global economics has been  enlightening!\n\n[Source](https://np.reddit.com/user/pseudoHappyHippy/posts/)", "id": "sdep2t", "created_utc": 1643226692.0, "score": 1801, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 189, "comments": [{"body": "Thank you!

After the financial crisis the Fed drastically expand the ammount of excess reserves in the system to the point where the reserve requirement is no longer useful in controlling the ammount of reserves banks hold, this effectively means the Fed can't use the reserve requirement to expand or contract the money supply. On the same token they also can use OMO to control the FED funds rate anymore because the ammount of reserves in the system expand so drastically. Nowadays the Fed uses the IOER or intrest on excess reserves to control the money supply and how much banks are keeping in reserve, and also act as a floor for the Fed funds rate.\n\nI will also note that the Fed prints money in a very diffrent way than many think, they can order some physical cash from the bureu of engraving for a fee but the vast majority of their operations aren't done with physical cash.

Reserves also very rarely leave the banking system, they are essentially deposits at the Fed and can be reddemed into physical cash, however they are only redeemed into cash to cover withdrawls, however this isnt very common because a very small ammount of money in the system is actually withdrawn. For interbank transactions they settle the transaction in reserves (for example when ypu buy a car from somone your bank settle the transaction with the other persons bank in reserves, this applies to almost all transactions including loans which the bank pays the other countrpaty bank in reserves).\n\nEdit- it seems alot of people think the banking system is totally separate from the \"real\" economy and that's just not true. The banking system is just a way of settling transactions in the economy, for example when you get paid through direct deposit or when you buy food with a credit card, buy stocks, video games you name it it's all settled by two different counterparties banks.

So every time you spend a dollar someone else receives it. So the turnover rate is the velocity of money.\n\nTypically, not always though, increasing the velocity of money leads to a rise in inflation.\n\nIf a dollar bill sits in a savings account it stops being exchanged and it stops contributing to aggregate demand which is how the collapse of the velocity of money can mean lower inflation or even deflation over time.\n\nThis is because the velocity of money is tied to the number of transactions that each dollar will be used for. When the frequency of transactions rises, the velocity of money rises. Velocity is an indicator of how willing consumers are to spend money. Lots of expectations play into this, but future expectations of inflation is a big one.\n\nThis can operate as a feedback loop. Expectations are that inflation will increase so consumers buy now instead of later which in translates into a higher velocity which can then translate into inflation.  The opposite is also true.\n\nWhy hasn't the GDP increased by the amount the Fed injected into the economy why hasn't the velocity of money increased by that amount?  Simply put, it is because the private sector, mainly banks and investment houses has been hoarding and putting the money into assets.  This is what the Fed wanted because it has to keep banks liquid so that they could continue loan operations.  The Fed is the lender of last resort.

Simply put, it is because the private sector, mainly banks and investment houses has been hoarding and putting the money into assets\" \n\nThis is where you aren't correct, I have said this before and will say it again but the Fed didn't expand the private sectors balance sheet and didn't pump any money into the economy or banking system, QE is just an asset swap that leaves the private sectors balance sheet the same and expands the Feds balance sheet, once you stop thinking of QE as pumping money and as a swap, it will make sense.\n\nThe Fed just changes the types of assets banks hold from long-dated to short-dated, this expands the money supply because these affect the money supply directly or indirectly the T bonds and MBS aren't included in any money supply measurements which is why when the Fed swaps these bonds for reserves which do indirectly or directly affect money supply it looks like the money supply is expanding when in fact the money that we measure is expanding but the private sectors balance sheet change directly because of the Fed is null because money supply is the denominator in all calculations of velocity, increasing it will drop velocity sharply but as I have stated the Fed increases the money supply or more accurately its measurement by changing the composition of assets from not included in the calculation to ones included in calculations.\n\nAlso, the Fed can't do QE with investment houses they can only do QE with 24 primary dealers all of which are banks and I've said this before but banks don't invest in the stock market with deposits or bank reserves, Idk why you are so hung up on that idea but you should abandon it immediately because it is skewing your entire view. This has been the case since the Volker rule that makes this activity virtually impossible but also because banks can't invest deposits and thus reserves into the stock market because Basel deposit reserves ratios forbid it, In other words, a bank can only invest money it makes as profit into the stock market and even then it needs to follow by the Volker rule o. So your premise that QE inflates assets is incorrect because your understanding of QE is incorrect, QE doesn't add any money that wasn't there before it is simply an asset swap that makes the banking system more liquid. \n\nNow the one thing QE does do is lower interest rates, this makes it easier to borrow which could inflate assets though with the IOER the bank can control how much a bank is willing to lend so it's unlikely much of this boom was caused by this. What's incorrect to say is that QE directly inflates assets via purchases from banks with reserves which are incorrect for reasons I have outlined above.\n\nI've said this before many times so either you are ignoring my comments or aren't understanding, you seem like someone who does want to understand so I'm trying my best so please in your response I would like to see if you understood, I will link a very credible Fed paper with all sources and authors listed out.\n\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/regional-economist/third-quarter-2017/quantitative-easing-how-well-does-this-tool-work", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "What you are saying makes perfect sense to me.

Some call this the liquidity effect. This is an anecdotal observation, but it does seem to consistently occur with QE wouldn't you agree?\n\nSo much of this is intertwined with market psychology that when discussing it, things can get confusing very quickly. \n\nI'm going to read the link you provided and look at this deeper.

QE isn't government spending. The Fed pays for QE by crediting a banks reserve account by creating reserves out of thin air but this is better thought of as the Fed creating liabilities rather than money, bank reserves are essentially deposits at the Fed so you can think of this as the Fed creating liabilities for itself because deposits are liabilities to a bank, these reserves won't be converted into cash unless the bank needs to meet withdrawal demand which is rare. Reserves are actually used to settle almost all transactions (think when you buy a car, how it works is your bank settles the transaction with the car sellers bank in reserves so a transfer of reserves from one bank to another through Fedwire or CHIPS, this applies to any transaction that isn't done in cash which is basically all transactions, this even applies to loans)\n\nQE does influence rates and lending which can impact valuations and asset prices, however, the Feds IOER tool to pay interest on excess reserves is the Fed's primary tool to limit how much of a bank's capital it will lend out, banks won't lend more than the Fed wants them to, this tool replaced the reserve requirement once that became obsolete after 2008 because of the expansion of excess reserves, this tool is the crux of how the Fed controls the money supply nowadays.\n\nHowever, it is true that QE does make lending easier for consumers and banks by lowering rates increasing their reserves so this could impact valuations however most bank loans are to consumers and corporations, securities lending is a much smaller market so its impact on the stock market is likely very low.\n\nYou did touch on an important point which is psychology and of course, QE makes people feel safer and more likely to invest and spend, that's kinda the point. So again while QE can impact valuations in all of these ways this isn't a \"giveaway\" to the rich nor is it making banks more money, it is simply changing the composition of assets in the system to try and influence the monetary policy, this is almost an injection of liquidity if you will, this is slightly misleading however because injection implies something new is added but what they mean is liquidity is injected by pulling out more illiquid assets in exchange for liquid ones.\n\n[https://www.stlouisfed.org/open-vault/2018/april/why-fed-pays-interest-banks-reserves](https://www.stlouisfed.org/open-vault/2018/april/why-fed-pays-interest-banks-reserves)", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "You are thinking about regular loan operations, not investment bank operations where an investment house loses money by blowing asset bubbles due to market activities.

What the Fed does again for the 20th time is swaps assets with banks the banks haven't gained anything after QE. Saying money hasn't entered the economy after QE would be the same thing as saying it before except before a bank-owned a T bond and now owns reserves you only notice this in MV2 because bank reserves do affect that measurement and T bonds don't.\n\n\"Case in point, the fed was caught buying corporate bonds. Compared to $11 trillion this activity was a small amount but nevertheless, that is how completely off track this episode was\" Firstly the Fed announced this they were not caught lol, and this was a temporary action to stabilize these companies. This isn't something the Fed normally does, plus this was a very small amount of QE. This is similar to how the bank bailouts was a temporary action In which the tresurey bought prepared stock to stabilize the banks, that isn't somthing the Fed or Treasury normaly do under normal circumstances.\n\nThe only way QE could be considered a wealth transfer system is that it pushes down long-term rates making borrowing easier. I can't say this enough times but QE just changes the composition of assets in the banking system, it doesn't add anything new, if a bank previously owned a 10 dollar bond after QE they own 10 is bank reserves but the overall quantity of assets in the private sector stays the same if you understood how QE worked you would understand this, this is absolutely not \"academic\" in any sense of the word.

Firstly Investment banks cannot invest in the stock market as I described in my first sentence. It's pretty clear you don't know what an investment bank is they are not a trading operation or a hedge fund. In 2008 the majority of banks that failed weren't investment/commercial mixes they were Lehman, Merill lynch and bear on the investment side, and Indy Mac, Ally, WaMu and others on the commercial side. the only Mix that got into trouble was Citigroup and they would have gotten into trouble regardless of the mix.

If you don't want to trust these that's fine but It's quite hypocritical to ignore all papers written by people who have studied this their whole lives to say \"I know better\" and I hope you see parallels with this thinking.\n\nNow my original post has absolutely nothing to do with glass Stegall but you seem adamant to talk about it so I will. this is a very debated topic among economists I fall in the group that doesn't think it's good regulation. My reasoning for this is that no other country has a regulation like this or has ever had one investment bank that has always been able to merge with commercial banks even china allows this. Again the banks that got into trouble in 2008 didn't mix they were independent investment banks (Lehman, Bear, Merrill) and commercial only (WaMu, GMAC, Indy Mac) the only mix that got in trouble was Citigroup and if you look at why it got into trouble it is completely separate from Glass Stegall and would have gotten into trouble regardless, the only argument you can make is that Glass Stegall repeals made larger banks which are totally true, however again these megabanks didn't collapse like their independent peers so the rule doesn't explain much about 2008 and why the crisis happened.\n\nso, in my opinion, it's a minor part. Now again I'm not trying to talk about 08, this stuff has been heavily debated, the stuff I wrote about how the Fed works aren't, saying I was wrong is equivalent to saying climate change isn't real just because, I will say the reason for 2008 was a lack of regulations and people who say otherwise aren't correct however I disagree that glass Stegall is a good or effective regulation. I agree banks need better capital controls and more derivatives regulation these are things almost every academic agrees on however I don't know why so many people get hung up on glass Stegall because it's just one regulation that's very debated but ill leave a Wikipedia article below with many viewpoints on It and I implore you to try and understand the other side, again this is completely unrelated to the Fed and QE.\n\nAgain I can't say this enough times but investment banks do not trade stocks. investment banks provide equity and debt underwriting as well as advisory and act as a broker-dealer for clients they also do corporate and securities lending. They aren't allowed to prop trade and haven't since the Volker rule and a quick google search reveals just this.  Investment banks do flow trade however that is completely different from what you are talking about because that's essentially acting as a market maker. Now I will agree there are loopholes because banks \"hedging\" can be very murky look at London whale for example so we still have a ways to go, but this normally involves things in interest rates and fixed income trading stocks and options as well as futures is completely banned and completely unprofitable after the Volker rule. your claim that banks and QE are pumping up the stock market is completely incorrect for a variety of reasons.\n\nso ill also address dark pools which are the most misunderstood thing on Reddit. Dark pools absolutely move the market. what dark pools do is don't flash the tape because they have no public order book, so the dark pool trade is only half out-loud or anonymous not in name but size. However dark pool trades are reported to the consolidated tape which collects data from every single exchange Lit or not on a 90-second delay which makes it so they absolutely move the market, it's just other participants may not know who's trading and how much they have left.\n\nI will add on a note before I finish that I think you seem like a good guy who is willing to learn but it is quite odd to see you using \"academic\" as a bad term, that's exactly like saying only a scientist would have the view that global warming is real.  Of course, all of this stuff is written by academics because again this is stuff that requires a ton of prerequisites to understand, and again just like me someone who knows nothing about science is in no position to refute global warming you are in no position to refute academics unless you can find evidence that exact author is faulty. It's funny to me how people won't trust an artical with a listed author and sources, but will trust an anonymous reddit post.\n\n[https://www.quora.com/Does-prop-trading-exist-in-any-of-the-main-banks-anymore-What-do-traders-do-now-and-can-they-make-anywhere-close-what-they-used-to](https://www.quora.com/Does-prop-trading-exist-in-any-of-the-main-banks-anymore-What-do-traders-do-now-and-can-they-make-anywhere-close-what-they-used-to)\n\n[https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-MB-14012](https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-MB-14012)\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/2020/bhca-9.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/2020/bhca-9.pdf)\n\n[https://mdfinancialskills.org/is-prop-trading-illegal/](https://mdfinancialskills.org/is-prop-trading-illegal/)\n\n[https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/trading-investing/proprietary-trading/](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/trading-investing/proprietary-trading/)\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aftermath\\_of\\_the\\_repeal\\_of\\_the\\_Glass%E2%80%93Steagall\\_Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aftermath_of_the_repeal_of_the_Glass%E2%80%93Steagall_Act)", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "Inflation is Taxation - the comment", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Inflation is taxation without representation.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "that was great. thank you!!", "score": 7, "replies": []}, {"body": "Top post, easy to understand for idiots like myself lol", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Excellent advice.  30 year/10 year inversion curve imminent unless the taper on 30 year accelerates.\n\nThe gap between 2 and 10 and 10 and 30 is ridiculous.

Further, existing Cybertruck holders have already been waiting two years, so a year and some isn’t all that outlandish. The prices in the truck market in the US also leans to indicate the market can support higher prices. The truck market is significant in terms of annual volume, and my take is that the limiting factor is going to be Tesla’s production, just as we’re seeing with the 3 and Y now. Of course, there are people with multiple reservations, however, there are also many people without a reservation that are waiting for final specs and pricing to be announced, so I think this will largely balance out.

I'm being generous to F and GM here as I don't think they'll have three batteries or institutional fortitude to ramp EVs (unions, dealerships, and legacy thinking are all headwinds for them on top of batteries) but even in this scenario, Tesla is going exponential while legacy can go linear at best. \n\nTo sum up, I think 250k sales commitments is conservative, and will be realized by end of 2025.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "If we are saying 2024, you are discounting 150-200k units from a variety of sources.

It’s one of the incredibly annoying things of the digital world (at least it’s annoying for me)!\n\nAddressing the 250k part first. No, I definitely don’t think the conversion is going to be 1m orders to 250k deliveries. Sorry if that’s what my response seemed to suggest. The 250k number came from the earnings call today; Elon said that is what they were targeting for production per year. That seems to be an ambitious number for first year production, and seemed to be the production goal after ramp (could be wrong but that’s what it seemed like he was saying on the call). However, my take is that number of 250k is way to small once Austin has ramped. In terms of conversion on a numbers basis, not strictly a specific order to sale but rather total sales versus order book before production starts, I’d realistically expect at least a 75% conversion.\n\nThe Maverick seems to be a neat truck and has received positive reviews, however, it’s in a completely different market segment, and don’t think it is a meaningful competitor to vehicles in the larger truck segment so I don’t expect it to be stealing sales. I have a hard time seeing a buyer interested in a Cybertruck going to a Maverick. \n\nPersonally, I think Rivian is going to experience a lot of difficulty, and despite being first to market with a relatively small number of vehicles it’s going to struggle delivering any meaningful numbers within the next two years before the Ford and Tesla are producing the Lightning and the Cybertruck in six digit volumes. I think in the high interest environment we’re headed, Rivian is going to have a hard time raising the capital it needs to continue operations and expanding, especially in light of its cash burn and it’s market cap coming back to earth. So, I don’t think Rivian is going to be doing much in the space either numbers wise, despite being first to sell electric pickups.\n\nFord I think has its act relatively together with the Lightning, and is really going all out with it. They’ve put some great features into it, and are targeting meaningful numbers. I think it’s going to be the closest competitor to Tesla in terms of unit sales against the Cybertruck. It will be interesting to see how dealers behave and if they’re going to play nice, and whether Ford itself will be able to hit its target numbers. It helps that the F-150 already has the clout it does in the US so I expect positive things from the F150, including as a function of how they’re positioning the vehicle, which includes leverage their product segment experience and making the vehicle attractive to fleet customers.\n\nRegarding GM, I’m more pessimistic about them. Personally, I think the Hummer is a giant joke, no pun intended. The Silverado has some neat features, particularly with the cargo area, however, it’s a little confusing who they’re actually targeting with the truck. It seems to be straddling some weird middle ground between a lifestyle truck and a work truck, without nailing either. Its also hard to believe GM’s numbers based on their track record and all round approach to EVs. They’ve announced twenty odd models by 2025 and a target of 1 million vehicles. So they’re planning on selling how many Silverados? What’s the point of the other models? As Tesla pointed out on their call, increasing the number of new models has a negative impact on the total amount of units they can produce because it saps resources in too many directions at once. Ford is pushing the Mach-e and the Lightning while GM seems to be chasing who knows what. \n\nSo with that said, I expect the Lightning to be there alongside the Cybertruck in meaningful numbers. I think the market segment is so large that there’s way more demand than manufactures can produce.\n\nIn terms of the Cybertruck specifically, I think it’s going to attract both existing truck people and also people who haven’t owned a truck before, such as myself.

A tesla will never look like an Audi, a Ford, a Porsche, a Lamborghini. Some people prefer teslas clean lines. Some people prefer Fords edgy Mach E design. Because looks are highly subjective, important to people in their car buying decision process and vary a lot brand to brand, tesla won't be able to have market domination like how apple does\n\nThat's fair enough.

I'm not a fan of Tesla's looks, but they look like that for a reason.

It doesn't need comparable range to ICE unless you drive crazy amounts per day, but 99% of people rarely drive more than ~400 miles in a single day.\n\nIf you turn it around and we were coming from EVs and transitioning to ICE vehicles, everyone would be crazy anxious about only being able to do 500 miles before you need to drive somewhere to recharge, and if you don't make it you can't just recharge at home or at the office.

Hell I hate pick-ups and even I wouldn't mind owning one. It's probably their only chance to survive the transition and I agree they'll probably make it. That said, they'll need to increase their production targets a lot more, and it's not as easy as just spending some money and more cars come out. Securing supply chains is difficult.

This is definitely the one downside to EVs.

Im sure you know people who buy huge AWD SUVs with way more space than they use, but their logic is they may one day need that much space\n\nI just think atm were still in the first adopter phase of EVs and only the people who are really onboard with the idea are jumping in now.

All mega corps are like this. Tesla was burning cash at an insane rate for a long time and only recently become profitable. I think these other companies were letting tesla go first to test the waters, and now that they're seeing EVs are here to stay, they're jumping in the game and hoping their brand power and decades of experience are enough to win market share\n\nAlso cars from large companies go through generations. By the time Tesla became popular, the current generation was already set in stone. They spend a huge amount on R&D of engines and transmissions and they weren't gonna throw that away immediately for a new and unproven (\tat the time) tech. \n\nBut now we're seeing them switch with the next generation. Personally i think the major players are okay. I think the minor players like Jaguar, Alfa Romeo, Mitsubishi, etc will be in trouble. But Ford, GM, BMW, Mercedes, VW/Audi, Toyota, Honda will be okay. They have strong brand power and imo that does mean a lot in the car market. For decades we know that Honda / Toyota are affordable and reliable. We know that the Germans are high tech, luxurious and a little unreliable. We know the americans are affordable but have cool styling and usually big power\n\nThe other thing about the established brands is i know they're good at building cars that drive well. EVs are essentially just a different powertrain and everything else is a carry over from traditional cars. Important things like suspension, handling, steering, chassis, braking, interior tech and design, user interfaces, luxury and ergonomics. Not to mention electronic systems like traction control, stability control, radar cruise control, electronic differentials, power delivery managements, etc\n\nFrom a performance and driving point of view, there is a lot that goes into building a car beyond how its powered. Just take a look into the engineering effort of the Porsche 911, or Chevy alfa platform cars, or the BMW M340i / M3. Those cars / platforms are so well developed and those cars dynamically drive so well that imo startups like tesla, lucid, nio, rivian, etc can't compete in that aspect. Porsche has been refining the 911 for 50 years, and when they built the Taycan they used those learnings into making the Taycan dynamically drive well. Reviewers always say the Taycan does one thing the other EVs can't, it drives like a Porsche\n\nI think you and i have interesting takes on the matter. My point of view is from the traditional automotive world, and yours is from new age companies like tesla. I think you and i both make good points and its likely that reality lies somewhere in the middle of both our viewpoints\n\nIn terms of the financials and the business models, the established major car companies have been through many economic and industry changes. They've been through global recessions and theyve been through radical engineering changes. Yes we have seen ICE powertrains for a long time, but everything about cars have changes tremendously over the last 60-70 years and i have faith they'll manage through it. I mean they made it through the OPEC oil crisis of the 70s and that threatened the established way of engineering from the 60s for many companies. Cars have also evolved a lot in just the last 10 years. Cars are smoother, more efficient, more luxurious, better built and more reliable than ever before. Switching to EV power trains is just another evolution and imo won't be the final evolution or the final solution\n\n>I think there will definitely be issues here, but I think precisely because there will be issues, the switch will happen fast. I liken it to WiFi. Back in 2010, nobody had public WiFi networks and especially on a holiday it was a freaking disaster. For a few years it sucked, but about 5 years later every hotel, B&B, restaurant, etc. had WiFi because people expected it. I think the same will happen with chargers, but on the road as well as at hotels/apartments/etc. If I had to guess, I think there will be problems between 2025 and 2030 in Europe, maybe 2-4 years later in the US, and after that a lot will have alleviated.\n\nThat's true, governments and companies seem to do their best work when their backs are against the wall. Putting up charging stations is one thing, having a robust and powerful enough electric grid is an entirely different issue and one that i think is being overlooked atm. If you recall, last summer parts of Texas were hit with very cold temperatures and many areas experienced electrical failures. At the time, EVs cost 100s of dollars to charge up. The systems need to be robust enough and have enough redundancies so that events like that don't happen", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": ">Tesla's big benefit was being the first major player in the EV game, but when everyone else catches up they'll have a lot stiffer competition\n\nTesla's big secret is that by BEING in that final competition, they have already won.\n\nLet's say you only give them the largest current market share (ICEv only) of a current big OEM, then use Tesla's operating and gross margins, and you get massive profitability numbers even still.

The vast majority of existing SFRs would need a hefty overhaul to see serious benefits, I thought.  So, limited opportunity for a long, long while?\n\nI wonder if someone with more HVAC/home building experience could spare some thoughts on the opportunity this may or may not present?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I'm in building system design and see some very clear ways Tesla could provide value in the home heating/cooling arena.\n\nMost HVAC for home units is done with 11 EER/13 SEER units (cheapest available).  EER is just a measure of BTU's per KW the unit can make.  SEER takes into account seasonality and works out the total efficiency of a cooling season and is a better measure (it's just TOTAL BTU's in a season / TOTAL KW used in a season).\n\nResidential units are available up the low 20's SEER (for 2-3x the price for the equipment).  Say you have a 23 SEER unit instead of a 13 SEER unit, it will use 43% less energy for the same cooling right off the top.\n\nNext you could introduce variable air volume (VAV) with wireless grills (like what Flair does) to retrofit into an existing system.   The reason this isn't super great right now is that equipment needs to maintain a minimum airflow to avoid freezing the coils.  If you've ever not replaced your air filter and frozen out your coil, you would have experienced this.  For example, in the summer evenings, when you go to bed, why cool your whole house?  Just close the vents throughout the house and cool the bedroom right?  Wrong, you'll go below your minimum airflows and freeze out your unit.  How do you fix this?  Have \"sophisticated\" controls and variable frequency drives on your compressors.  (There is another technology called hot gas bypass that also accomplishes this but IMO it makes less sense for the application).  The VFD's on  the compressors allows them to produce less cooling to match the demand of the house and therefore you don't overcool the coils and freeze them.  Just for an idea, the technology in Nest theromostats and their associated sensors would be plenty to do this.  All you need is a little battery powered occupancy sensor and temperature sensor in each room.  This could very easily be done in one device per room.\n\nYou can replace the outdoor condenser unit and indoor air handler while keeping the existing ductwork in most cases.  If its a existing modern system with variable frequency drive they can probably integrate with the existing air handler.  Otherwise you'd probably have to replace both (air handler is only worth around $1K though, probably better to just replace the whole system so you're not dealing with existing garbage).\n\nAll of this is done in commercial applications and with costs for electronics dropping it is VERY doable for Tesla to annihilate this space.  If you knew how bad commercial HVAC controls were, you'd laugh.  They literally still use token-ring networking for many HVAC controls systems.\n\n**EDIT Some additional thoughts:**\n\nTesla is somewhat uniquely positioned to tackle this task.  A VFD is basically just an inverter that varies the speed of a motor.  Sound familiar to Tesla's core competencies?  Their drivetrain engineers certainly are overqualified to tackle this.\n\nTheir team responsible for the heat pump in their cars can certainly tackle this for a building.  They don't have to worry about weight since it doesn't move, so again, overqualified to tackle this.\n\nThey have their fingers in the home with solar.  Solar outputs DC power before inverting to AC @ 50/60Hz.  VFD's usually take AC @ 50/60Hz from the grid, turn it into DC, then make AC @ whatever speed needed to turn the motor.  DC straight from solar can bypass the first step and gain efficiency.  Peak solar output strongly correlates to HVAC demand for much of the year so this efficiency could be a substantial savings.\n\nTesla could very easily make a home hub style product to integrate all of the above sensors and controls of the home.  It probably could be done for a $200 mass produced piece of hardware.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Ooooh, now this is very helpful - thats a really informative write up.

A 3/2/2 SFR in that area  around 1,400 sqft can run power bills fluctuating from around $120 to $220ish a month (top of that range being  over winter and summer obviously as the HVAC is like 75% of the power bill).", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I don't see a reason why you couldn't just reuse existing ductwork if its there.

This only requires 2 small (\\~1\" incl. insulation) refrigerant lines per indoor unit to be run throughout and snaked in walls, etc.   These systems are even more efficient than ducted systems.  VRF is variable refrigerant flow.  Instead of varying airflow to each room, it has a little wall mounted unit which has a fan and it varies the amount of refrigerant sent to each room (instead of the VAV option where a single unit has the fan and refrigerant sent to it for the whole house and then airflow is varied through each room).\n\nBetween those two system types, you'd cover the majority of residential use cases.  The only question is what the colder states move to in lieu of natural gas and fuel oil for heating.  I expect they'll all go to a heat pump system but it's still expensive.

I think that a much-improved FSD is possible by this year, but I have strong doubts about the robot. It sounds like they're approaching the problem only from the software side, thinking that once it's solved the hardware issue will just magically solve itself.\n\nIn reality, for a car, the only operations are running a motor forwards and backwards and turning a wheel, and all the AI needs to do is avoid hitting anything. A robot, however, has multiple joints, needs to walk upright, and pick up objects of various shapes and sizes with enough precision that it doesn't miss it but also doesn't crush or drop it. Add on having to recognize the object in different lighting conditions and also understanding what the object is so that it can apply the appropriate force (picking up a heavy metal object is vastly different than picking up a feather), and I think that it's basically a pie in the sky dream for 2022. Take the Boston Dynamics' Atlas robot for example, where even a slight mistiming of a motor movement causes it to fall over, and that's just for walking, much less grabbing objects:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aUBpByABiA\n\nAnd state of the art right now for grabbing robots is Boston Dynamics' Spot robot with a single claw-style grabbing arm:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Zbhvaac68Y\n\nMore practically, I think that what they'll end up doing is putting their AI in a factory robot. Currently, factory robots are very good at repeating the same movement over and over, but they can't tell whether they're doing a good job or if something is going wrong. With an AI powering it, it may be able to do things like recognize when something is out of alignment and make movements to correct that, or self-calibrate its motor movements to account for the slight differences between motors (usually each machine has to be calibrated individually, which takes a lot of time).

For the robot to be able to do what a human can, it must presumably be able to preforms tasks that require fine motor skills. So like solving a rubix cube? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4O8pojMF0w\n\nor recently researchers from ETH managed to train a robot dog via RL https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXbb6KQ0xV8. \n\nThe list goes on and on. The key point is that the NN for each problem is only really good for that specific task. So to have one humanoid robot that is supposed to walk around and do basically anything a human can is WAY beyond the SOTA of robotics and ML right now as far as I can tell.

That’s the long term goal that probably won’t be realised within the decade. However, a robot that can do repeatedly perform a narrow set of tasks can already be very useful. I think one of the biggest obstacle to Boston Dynamics robots is the lack of situational awareness. Although Atlas has depth perception, a robot in the real world needs to understand the world better to navigate it. For instance, a smart robot should try to avoid tripping on wires or stepping onto a soft ledge. Otherwise, it’s only good in a pristine lab environment. And that’s where Tesla AI comes in.

A car doesn't have to know how soft, hard, or heavy an object is, nor does it need to know how it can interact with it outside of avoiding it. A car AI can easily avoid a trash can, and we don't even need AI for that. It's a different thing altogether to recognize where the handle is on the trash can, then run the motors in such a way that it opens the lid of a trash can.

Use margin to start selling weekly PUTs and go back in to the positions I sold hoping to participate in the rebound, keep wheeling with margin (2.5x notional max - reach break even faster / more risk).\n\n2. Stay at or near cash only while wheeling (1.25x notional max - reach break even slower / less risk) .\n\n3. Accept that the stock market is not for me and cash out, put that money in a 10% PY fixed Certificate of Deposit (non US).\n\nI have some cash coming at the end of the month that should allow me to weather a 25% drop in these equities (can hold a 15% drop ATM), but I'm not sure if I am safe or exagerating stuff.\n\nFrankly I'm tired of the stock market and don't feel like looking at news / charts anytime soon, I'm fairly new here(1Y), I started using leverage around October, I've lost(realized) 25% of my account this month (10k), my portfolio is about 30% of my retirement money, won't be needing it soon but losing it will definitely hurt, no debt around.\n\nWhat would you do in my position?\n\nThanks for your opinion guys, don't bash me too much please\n\nEdit: details", "id": "sddlw9", "created_utc": 1643223902.0, "score": 104, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 154, "comments": [{"body": "You are basically doing Thetagang version of buying high and selling low.

Around noon, the S&P was down 3.5%, and the nasdaq was down close to 5%\n\nThis tends to happen post opex, especially as hedges roll-over, and with the VIX running at 30, it was forcing liquidation by institutional longs. This forced liquidation and negative gamma was forcing dealers to go short, leading to the sell-off. I had thought this was going to create an ignition effect similar to late feb 2020, whereby the increasing volatility creates a cycle of forced selling by particularly factor strategies with VIX as an input, creating every increasing VIX and spiraling into a liquidation cascade that resembled the Covid crash.  Everything was looking similar, including the VIX and SPX.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/sboq57/road\\_to\\_vix\\_150\\_spx\\_2000\\_technical\\_analysis/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/sboq57/road_to_vix_150_spx_2000_technical_analysis/)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dfdw2fzgkxd81.png?width=2247&format=png&auto=webp&s=05d5b1b610dc84d9ba0b5374371836cb9fd10d4f\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/33o1mgrtnyd81.png?width=2243&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6f0a0c5ed664720696128ab1e6ea19f39e5d668\n\nPut volume was exploding as everyone was trying to get puts to hedge their books, to levels of the early March 2020 highs.\n\nthen something strange happened, at almost exactly at noon, some player, I mean really big player stepped into the market and started selling billions and billions of puts.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x7gdxnvjoyd81.png?width=752&format=png&auto=webp&s=55fded0a5c60e1c0840d10449eefd410f853d879\n\nThis is the equivalent of something going infront a freight train that was gathering speed, and saying, i am going to step on to the track and directly fight it with the worst risk reward known to man.

With MBS they're also taking on prepayment risk.  \n\nAnd as long as the system is flooded with cash, banks won't need to borrow at the overnight rate.  In fact, banks have been parking $1.5 trillion at the reverse repo facility.  When they raise rates they'll pay higher interest on the reverse repo.  So it's free money to huge banks.  The $1.5 trillion is also proof that they've printed way more money than necessary to support the economy.\n\nPartly devil's advocate again - probably one of the reasons they've done so much QE is that if they didn't buy the bonds, there's a chance that nobody would (at least not at these yields).  That would mean that unless politicians can agree to balance a budget, deficit spending will 1) pull money out of private investment and 2) raise market yields on bonds, stocks, real estate...  basically crash everything.

Well I imagine that things like appreciation or other outside factors can keep the balance sheet growing faster or keeping pace with the reduction of the purchasing rate.However more importantly none of this is that big a deal since these smooth brainers still don't understand that real rates are continuing negative, possibly quicker than any proposed hikes, so money is actually probably still getting easier and looser and not tighter despite the fake appearance.

Again I haven't personally check this myself but it seems to be the disconnect you may be having, or maybe what I'm saying is nonsense though I'm not sure why it would be.\n\nI agree with inflation however from the prospective of a bond investor and the government they really don't seem to care.

{"title": "Relax", "selftext": "Seeing a ton of fear and misinformation. Relax. You will be okay. \n\n1) this is not a crash. This is a correction. Corrections are healthy, rebound quickly, and happen cyclically. We could see another 5% but I still wouldn’t worry too much. \n\n2) January is usually a bad/volatile month as leaps expire, folks rebalance portfolios, and people wait for earnings (list not exclusive). Rate hikes always cause a little dip. Nothing to worry about. \n\n3) there is no catalyst for a crash. The economy is strong. Labor market is strong (arguably the strongest ever as we are witnessing a labor shortage). Inflation is high but will be curbed with rate hikes. Rates remain historically low and will not affect consumer spending. Anything under 5% is incredibly low. \n\n4) rate hikes are necessary. A) we need to build in a safety net for QE if the economy does slow. B) rate hikes will help with inflation. Rate hikes are the smart move and just happening a bit too late and slow. \n\n5) every equity has a discernible value. Because of democratized investing and government aid tons of new investors have entered the markets. A lot of new money. So, some equities got a bit over their skis. Those equities will get hit the hardest but they are not “crashing” they are just coming back down to earth. This happens regularly and actually shakes out a lot of novice investors, bringing the entire market back to homeostasis. Which is a lesson for all new investors: never trade the hype and never trade on TA. Fundamentals are crucial for serious investors and if you want to make real long term money in the market, if you want to build real wealth, you must learn fundamental analysis and read business books to understand basic sound business. Knowing how to invest and how to spot great companies/ leaders is a valuable skill. In the same vein, equities and indexes will only fall so much before institutions start gobbling up shares trading at low multiples or offering high div yield. For example, it’s unlikely the spy falls another $75, the valuation would be too cheap and the yield to high, folks will start accumulating well before those levels. Everything has a value. \n\n6) this is not the 70’s, stagflation unlikely. Strong economy. Strong jobs numbers. Low interest rates. \n\n7) Russia is a threat but America is not. Let me explain. Russia now controls a number of major oil and natural gas supplies, especially since Germany shut down its plants. Russia controls a lot of energy. Russia could drive oil prices, natural gas prices and energy prices through the roof. If we intervene in the current political conflict they will do just that. Which is why we won’t intervene. Just like Obama never actually intervened in Crimea. Politicians like to talk but I doubt they act. \n\n8) markets always recover. Even if it takes a few years. Don’t panic. Don’t sell. Keep your money parked in good equities with strong leadership and long term growth potential. Long term, you will make a nice return. Patience is key. The stock market is merely a means of transferring wealth from the impatient to the patient. \n\nGood luck to all. I’m not trashing anyone or any trading strategies. Just sharing insight from a seasoned and successful investor. But my way is not the only way. If you disagree, share your thesis. I’m always looking for a diff perspective and to learn. And I hope everyone wins—bears, bulls, TA, FA, quants, newbies . . . Just have fun and make some money. That’s what it’s all about. stop trashing each other, life is hard enough, the world is shitty enough, stop hating and bringing your negativity here.\n\nEDIT: having read through some comments, recognizing general trends on main streets, and reviewing some historical data back to 2016 I do worry about certain sectors and equities. ‘22 might be a bit choppy, at least to start. Hard to tell how long this lasts. The amount of new & inexperienced $ in the market will create chop (it always does). How things shake out is yet to be seen. Usually a lot of new investors drop out and markets self correct. I don’t think the major indexes dip too far below 20% and recovery should be fairly quick. But, long term, we will face certain demand issues entirely separate from the supply chain issues we are currently witnessing (I don’t want to get too into this but if you’re curious, drop a comment and I will send you a great piece to read). So we are racing against the clock to raise rates and get equities back on track. Now more than ever it’s important to focus on fundamentals and look for long term plays.
