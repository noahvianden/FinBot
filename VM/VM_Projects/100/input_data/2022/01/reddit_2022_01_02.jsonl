{"title": "The Genius Behind Nany Pelosi's Trades", "selftext": "One of the greatest traders of our time - Nancy Pelosi. Joking aside, I was looking through her recent trades and couldn't help but notice how well structured they are. Her choices for the longs are very similar to how I set up my diagonals.\n\n* She's using long calls as a surrogate long stock position to take advantage of the leverage afforded by options. For example, the GOOG trade cost around $940K for her to put on. A similar stock trade would've been around $2.9MM.\n* She uses two different long call strategies, based on her disposition towards the stock.\n   * For more developed equities like GOOG, MU, DIS, she selected slightly shorter term expirations but went further ITM. This allows the trade to behave more like long stock while decreasing the impact of theta decay on the options.\n   * For more growth oriented equities like RBLX and CRM, she selected LEAP expirations and chose strikes closer to the money (although, still ITM). This offers more growth opportunity in the options if directionally correct, while still limiting the impact of theta decay on the longs.\n* She selected all established products with promising lines of business going forward. DIS surprised me a little bit, but since COVID they've been pivoting more and more to telecomm so I can understand her thought process the.\n* The choices she made are not the cheapest method to gain exposure, however, these are well structured trades. Diamond hands Pelosi at it again.\n\nEDITS for all the keyboard warriors:  \n\\-I'm not suggesting that Pelosi is actually any kind of great trader - the post is generally satire. The focus is more on the construction of the trades.  \n\\-The post isn't about how she selects the products, if there's insider trading, etc.   \n\\-To clarify, Nancy's husband makes most of the trades and she is required to report them. I have absolutely no idea who is actually structuring the trades, if they have an advisor, etc. Again, calling her the great trader is more of a joke than anything. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qq8uz7f0e6981.png?width=884&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f223e9b43171bf5e90edfa9ae41014830e2cf92", "id": "rtxxar", "created_utc": 1641086517.0, "score": 1409, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 528, "comments": [{"body": "I'm hoping someone makes an ETF called $SENATE or something to track the trades.

The many many decades prior to this that marker does not hold 100% true. Just because something has happened multiple times in recent history does not make it a standard. We can, and will at some point, have recessions without a preceding inversion. It’s this concrete thought process about economics that contributes to these recessions, when people are unable to adapt their thought process and actions to current situations we get ourselves in trouble. Bond yields reflect what the government feels is happening in the economy, the government is made up of people, making judgements based on their past experiences. When the bond yield inverts its the government signaling “we need money, and we need it fast because things are going to shit and we need to try and right it, or at least get ourselves some cash on hand to deal with the ensuing catastrophe.” They’re signaling poor short term outlook and by getting peoples money into more secure assets, like bonds, it will help reduce the overall impact of a recession, which is why BYC is a strong indicator to the overall health of the economy at any given time. But when short term yields go down, like they are now, it’s an attempt to help simulate an economy.

We’re propped up on tooth picks right now. Things can be righted and stabilized but we’re also one major event away from a serious down turn. When markets are stretched like this the final event that starts the cascade is the mass selling of assets by financial institutions. Once they identify a major threat and start liquidating it signals other institutions to take note, they identify the same issue and start liquidating as well, ad infinitum. By the time we know the exact assets that we’re toxic it’s too late and our overall markets are in the toilet.

Not only did many of them keep on falling, but most only recovered in 2021 or even later in 2021 or not at all (due to restrictions, drop in flights/bookings etc.), while other companies like Amazon, Tesla, Microsoft, Apple and what not hit record highs that were not expected prior to 2022/23.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "It actually was a great choice.

Dave and busters,  cruise lines, chefs warehouse. Chefs warehouse was probably the best one, all of the covid head in the sanders turned into panic selling idiots that thought restaurants were gone forever. Chefs 5xed within a year. Airlines had sharp rebounds from the flash bottom too before stagnating the rest of the year. Look glad you did well too, all I'm saying is \"prediciting: the covid crash didn't take nostradamus it only took being on reddit and following alternative news Sources and seeing it grow from Jan to Feb, my prior \"trading\" strategy was DCA only into MGK, cashed out and planned to only buy back MGK later but saw hige opportunities that really paid off. If I had actually known what options were or other trading strategies were I would have been very rich instead of only tripling my 401k over the past 20ish months it would have been at least a 10x", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I just want to emphasize that I do not doubt any profits or such, especially on Reddit you will see all kinds of people making 1000s of percent profits in a couple of days with a gamble, but everyone knows it was a gamble and not an obvious move to make. The reason I dislike calling something like that obvious is because it makes people think it was stupid to stick to their plan. If the plan was stupid that's something else, but no one knew where Covid was actually heading **worldwide** and what impact it will have. Given that a majority of people thought it would be over in Summer 2020, latest Autumn 2020.\n\nI don't know, let me check for the largest travelling stocks. Maybe I am just completely wrong and I remember it wrong. Starting of course at Mar 2020. Note that I am using the prices that Yahoo finances shows per month, so when I say high it's the price of the beginning of the month. I think it's very unrealistic to sell precisely at the 1 time intraday high it shows at 52 Week Range.\n\nABNB: Can't find data prior to Dec 2020 \n\nBKNG: 1345, it it's high in April 2021 at 2466, no doubling\n\nEXPE: 136, low of 56. Between Oct-Nov 2020 it doubled, half a year later.\n\nTCOM: 23.45, hit a high of 41.85 in May 2021, no doubling\n\nTRIP: 17.39, hit a high of 51.39 in Mar 2021, but doubled in Feb 2021. \n\nI mean, if you managed to pick off the small individual players (compared to the leading ones) and had the huge increases, then respect to you. But for me that feels a bit like picking the winners in hindsight while the majority sucked compared to the market, like saying pennystocks are amazing and then only showing off those that made a 20x profit in weeks.\n\nNow, these numbers assume you bought at the utter lowest point possible. That means you didn't sell and bought into them in January, when news came out about Covid, but end of March. I think that's very unlikely, which makes the scenario even far worse than the numbers at the top show.\n\nNow for a comparison, the top 5 tech stocks for tech by market cap. I am using tech because they are usually a fan favorite.\n\nAAPL: 63.57, doubled in August 2020 or 5 months later.\n\nMSFT: 157.71, doubled October 2021. \n\nGOOG: 1162.81, doubled in April 2021.\n\nAMZN: 1949, high of 3773, no doubling\n\nTSLA: I'm gonna exclude this one because it was not yet a market leader by market cap, but it went from 104.8 to well, a ton, high of 1243.\n\nFB: 166.8, doubled in May 2021\n\nFor Airlines, the picture is similar.\n\nLUV: 35.61, high of 62.78 in Apr 2021, no doubling\n\nDAL: 39.08, high of 48.28 in Feb 2021, no doubling.\n\nI don't want to do hindsight comparing, I am just responding to the \"it was obvious\" and then picking travelling stocks. In fact, with Covid being as unknown as it was regarding lethality, severity and impact, travelling stocks could have ended in an unrecoverable downward spiral. It's good if you made good money off of it, but I am just highly doubting what you are saying given history of arguments I had online of people claiming things to make a point but it turned out they were not reflecting reality.\n\nEvergrande was all over Reddit AND the news, it was predicted that if they default the banking system, which is already under a huge strain of Covid, Debt ceiling, debt and interest rates. A ton of investors oversees put a huge amount of money into it, from which they won't see their monthly payment and might not even ever see their money again for another decade - if anything at all.

The strategies aren’t different, but there are far more people with access today than in 2001 or 2008. The volume is several times more violent. This has caused ramifications that are unique to this time simply because of that volume. \n\n3. I make it a habit not to compare the companies of the 90’s and the tech era. This scope is so much more robust today. I understand why you feel this way on this particular matter and I don’t have any intention to dissuade you. \n\n4. I think you’ve drawn another conclusion that those are the only companies that I would want. Not the case. I just don’t think those in particular will be surmounted in 10 years. I wasn’t going to list 500 companies and state them all to be worthy lol. Only time will tell. \n\n5. Median wages for individuals, adjusted for inflation are not higher. The buying power today pales in comparison to the last several decades. That’s a generally accepted fact by many economists. \n\n6. But there has never been a time where so many of those participants have been able to enter the market and piss off everyone else. Amongst other things that they do. \n\n7. A stronger economy is supposed to be better for everyone, but the 35k lags significantly regardless. That’s not something to overlook. \n\n8. The dot com bubble was beyond awful, but generally speaking, most stock related recessions don’t last as long as that one. It’s the one “bogey man” that capitulates fear to anyone that pays attention to the market going forward. (This statement is strictly in reference to the market in this case, not real life) Not saying it can’t happen again though, but if it did, the runway of opportunities someone under 40 would have would be quite high. \n\nI’m under 40, but not in my 20’s. I’m an attorney with a background in economics/accounting (boring), so my trust in the nature/belief of economists will likely come off quite a bit.  I don’t believe personally that 50 years ago was rosy at all. You’d be hard pressed to get me to name a “rosy” time in any culture. What I believe is the stance that many economists argue when they say buying power was stronger 30-50 years ago than it is today. That’s a pretty common statement. \n\nWhen it comes to the pricing of housing, healthcare, education etc, and the fact that an entire gender didn’t compete for jobs in the same areas of the workforce(for obvious reasons), and contemplate that to the wages, yes, buying power was greater back then, and it has NOT kept up with today. \n\nOnce again….grammar….punctuation….my bad.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "[removed]", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I really want to continue, but I have to head out to breakfast man/lady lol.

Commodities can decline in value faster than stocks. Real estate can plummet.\n\nOver long periods of time, if stock market performance is weak or negative, it means businesses aren’t generating profits. That means corporate bonds are risky. It means there’s little demand for commodities or real estate. It means governments aren’t collecting much tax revenue, and are facing increasing costs for entitlements and other burdens.\n\nNothing can guarantee financial security in the far future, but if you don’t get financial security from stocks, there’s a strong case to be made that you will not be able to get it anywhere.

{"title": "Cash is a position - and a bad one", "selftext": "My person: I am 59 years of age and bought my first security 40 years ago.\n\nI keep reading that cash is a good thing to hold in case the market breaks. Bonds (except maybe Junk Bonds) are basically the same as cash when looking at inflation.\n\nI write this article because it seems that 95% of investors have another opinion, I am a contrarian here.\n\nCash is a position; and a dangerous one. The main problem is of course that security investments are always compared to cash, even measured in cash. But cash can be more volatile than securities. Cash may be created by central banks, by banks and even by every person just writing a debt on a piece of paper. But this is not the subject of this post.\n\nEverybody needs cash, it is so practical. Without it you would need to exchange goods for goods, which could be a pain in the ass. True. Money has two purposes: facilitate exchange of goods and keep values. Now, money is not very good at keeping value. So the best you can do with it is exchange it for goods.\n\nSometimes you may read something like \"a lot of our money is debt\". That is true, even worse, all of our money is debt. And it is almost guaranteed to lose value.\n\nSo what can we do? I cannot speak for other people, but I can describe what I do: As money is debt, somebody owes me. So I try to create debt for myself to balance that out. I usually take a margin loan with my broker for every cent I have in my purse or in my bank accounts. That debt is covered by dividend stocks that at the moment pay more dividends then I have to pay interest.\n\nNow the second argument that one hears in favour of cash: the market may crash and you can use it to buy stocks then. That is a valued argument, but what happens during the time you have to wait for such an event to occur? You lose double, money decreases in value and you lose the opportunity to gain money in other investments.\n\nSo what do I do? I am always invested 100%. When the market dips 20% or more I wait for signs of recovery, than buy on margin, if possible stocks that pay more dividends than I have to pay interest. Then I pay down the debt with the dividends and some partial sales when the market reaches a top again.\n\nIn my early days as an investor there was a saying \"divide your investments: your age in bonds, the rest in stocks\". I don't like that, liquid stocks are easier to cash-in then bonds. And bonds are almost guaranteed to lose money now.\n\nHope I could give some of you a different perspective.\n\nWish you all a happy and successful new year!", "id": "ru65e5", "created_utc": 1641115459.0, "score": 62, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "num_comments": 122, "comments": [{"body": "Cash is a form of diversification, and is significantly less volatile than almost any other form of wealth.\n\nMargin borrowing doubles the volatility of stocks instantly. \"Buy the dip\" is a reliance on regression to the mean, and only works when markets are diverting randomly, not when secular changes are occurring. Margin also introduces interest costs that quickly swamp the inflation cost of keeping cash ready or the frictional cost of selling something else to free up funds.\n\nRefusing to carry cash at all rejects its ability to avoid and blunt other kinds of risk, the same as those other investments help avoid the risks of cash. Telling people to go on margin instead just multiplies risk and negates the justification of avoiding any particular risk.\n\nTo properly diversify you should not have all your wealth in any one form or class of investments. All stocks or stocks plus index ETFs is a concentration in the corporate equity market, which is well known to go completely haywire at flash-crash rates. You shouldn't be all-equities any more than you'd be all-cash.\n\nIf you don't want to deal in things that aren't exchange tradeable, you should have commodity funds (ETF or ETN or whatever), direct real estate funds, mortgage funds, equities in multiple sectors, ETFs in multiple strategies, multiple forms of currency, and of course count your house, insurance, and Social Security entitlements as part of your diversification scheme.

If your broker habitually shifts your cash to an MMA, then that's also protected by FDIC up to $250k, and if the MMA further splits it between several underwriter banks (many do now) then it is $250k times the number they split it into. If you have an individual and a joint account, each gets full protection, and if you have taxable, trad IRA, and Roth,  each of those is fully protected, so even in one broker you can have several million split among half a dozen accounts and it could all be covered.

You speak strategy and I agree, there are strategies where bonds make sense. Even cash may make sense. But I spoke of my personal situation and for me neither bonds nor cash makes sense in an inflationary environment like just now. But then again I don't invest billions, otherwise probably there would be a need for bonds, cash and other strategies.\n3. Holding USD for me that spends a lot in Switzerland where I own a home would be a very bad thing the last 30 years. You see, it all depends on the viewpoint.\n4. This is like \"to understand regression you have to understand regression\". Volatility of stocks is measured in cash. But then inflation adds to it, so if inflation hits cash harder than stocks (like most of the time) cash is more volatile than equity.\n5. OK, this is more of an economic question. In my opinion everybody who lends money creates cash. Actually cash is just a piece of paper stating this debt. Once the debt is paid back the money disappears. Simple view but that is enough for me.\n6. Money is a very secure thing. It is almost a 100% secure... to lose value.\n7.

Maybe once in a blue moon, someone will tell you that the other way is more profitable.\n\nIll reduce it down to what everyone should be doing to maximize profit. It only takes 2 question (okay maybe 2 and a half questions...) and you have to answer honestly.\n\nHere are the questions:\n\n1. Are you significantly more intelligent than average and do you actively improve your intelligence over time? Some valid measures would be level of math completed or if you can solve hard STEM problems without just guessing. There are other ways to measure too but those are the most obvious since we can easily measure them.\n   1. And as you aged, did you take time to actually get even smarter or are you coasting on what you had when you were young? Did you learn a new complex skill? Did you go out of your way to read an actual STEM book (not just some biography with someone opinions).\n2. Do you have 20-40 hours per week to invest into research?\n\nThats it. Now there are 4 possible answers but only 2 possible outcomes. Here we go.\n\nBased on your answers to questions 1 and 2 above:\n\n* No/No - You should passive index. For this person picking stock is gambling.\n* Yes/No - You should passive index because you dont have time.\n* No/Yes - You should passive index. For this person picking stock is gambling.\n* Yes/Yes - **THE HOLY GRAIL**\n\nIf you fall under the Yes/Yes category then you should be active and to be active you need cash. **Cash = Opportunity**. Its not infallible but opportunity is the most valuable asset you can have if you want to beat the markets. Thats not to say you cannot beat unless youre a rocket scientist with 100 hours to spare per week, but your odds drop a lot and for every success there are likely 9 failures. This is why its gambling.\n\nThe author of this thread incorrectly assumes crashes are infrequent. They arent. Anyone with any experience knows that we get sector or sub-sector level crashes on a scale of once to twice a year on average. **ON AVERAGE**. Many call them \"dips\" but I dont do just plain old 5%-10% dips. There are some very quiet years where nothing happens but this is actually rare. Most years you will get a crash of some sort and sometimes you hit the jackpot with a market wide crash and other time you might get two or three a year like in 2020 when we had a market wide and we had an oil crash later.\n\nHell, we also had a crash in 2021 and we might still be in it. This time its speculative tech/finance. They are down 30%-50%. Now granted that doesnt mean you should go buy peleton or tdoc or palantir but guess what? When this stuff happens >> IT TAKES EVEN GOOD PROFITABLE COMPANIES DOWN WITH IT << And that is the key. This is where you outperform but you need to recognize it and be disciplined enough not to gamble on the bad companies. Hence intelligence and time.\n\nThe author also severely underestimates the value of these sub sector crashes. He incorrectly assumes that missing a year will even you out with the time over timing crowd... he is wrong. Very wrong. A single trade during one of these big dips will outsize many years of normal performance. It is what it is.\n\nNow all that said, Im not advocating this for everyone. This is why I asked those questions above. To be honest, finding someone with high intelligence is uncommon and who also has time to burn is peven more rare because most people have jobs, or family and time is not available.\n\nFurther, what percent of the population actually continues to exercise their brain after high school or college? I mean... what? Maybe 1 in 100 people actually do that? Most say they will or want to but never actually do it. A normal person just coasts intellectually for most of their life if not all of it. And thats ok. Doesnt make you bad just that you did the minimum to get along. This is perfectly normal behavior. But stocks are a moving target. Its a little like working in tech but with much faster cycles. You either improve or you become obsolete. With stocks it worse because change happens even faster and you need to be ahead of the curve, not just riding it.\n\nSo yea... cash is king. It always was. Namely because its limitless opportunity for those who can capitalize. But not every can. Also note that almost all financial advisors and analysts fall under the No/Yes profile.

It’s how we socialize and treat other people. Positive minds are always equal to socially. Self worth is love within and showing it off to other people, not DOING stuff to get noticed. \n\nHumor in a mind, when authentic, is about sharing emotions (thoughts, ideas, and beliefs) that honor all people. There is no authority here. Serious minds, or minds that laugh but also look down on other people socially, share ideas and beliefs that are cruel and selfish. \n\nPeople always focus on vibe. We are all connected within non-locally (quantum entanglement). When human beings present a false image socially, which means the outer persona does not match the inner persona, it insults the intelligence and awareness of others. No one likes seeing lying in others about who they are within, when we already FEEL it and know the truth.\n\nWe are all equal socially already. No one is on top, no one is on the bottom, and no one has any worth to prove to anyone. No one is an authority figure here. No one has a free pass to judge people more than others. Ideas rooted in social hierarchy are degrading, humiliating, and stupid.\n\nType A bullies / alphas are not stronger than people that are mellow and friendly socially. Type A / alphas have low feelings of self worth, mental instability, problems with manipulation & dishonesty, and emotional issues. They take their own feelings of self hate and self loathing out on other people socially, unprovoked, for no good reason at all. \n\nQuite often the reasons people judge and cut other individuals down socially without hesitation and incessantly is ONLY because of a competitive nature, not because of a serious threat due to character issues in a person. Cheating in life is knocking people down socially to build up a social life. It’s a bad idea. People see head games in the minds of others. It’s important to be real about this and show honesty socially as much as possible.\n\nWhen people are authentic, they never use career, talent, physical stature / brawn, education, or money as a crutch for self worth socially. There is never a reason to “dominate” others in any area of life when we show or believe in love and friendship. Feelings of self worth come from kindness, honesty, and humility socially, not from social images. Dominators don’t believe in their own personalities or worth. They seek to tear other people down instead.\n\nVery often it’s nice, warm, humble, mature personalities that are already upset and insecure from judgments of the past that are knocked down unfairly even more by status seeking social elitists. People often see gentle human beings as “easy targets” to look down on so that they can attempt to build up their perceived status in an imaginary social hierarchy. Only conformists and shallow cowards think in these terms, not headstrong men and women with honesty, kindness, and respect. \n\nWhen people are unwilling to pass judgments as much as possible and want to remain friendly, level, and sincere socially, it’s not out of weakness. It makes a human being mentally sharp, emotionally strong, and much more mature socially. It’s a threatening attitude to people that show hatred and jealousy (judgments) socially. \n\nJudgements from status seekers usually have little actual substance or anything to do with character issues, violence in a personality, or antisocial, critical personality issues. Judgments from status seekers are hypocritical, shallow, cruel, and unfair. They ultimately cause violence and war.\n\nNo one cares about showboating or showing off. No one accepts or tolerates authority in other people - it just seems that way on the surface. Everyone is a spiritual being that sees through bullshit. The more conceited the mind, the more dishonesty there is in it.\n\nPeople remain competitive only when they care little about working through their own judgments, anger, and character issues with other people socially. People stay competitive because they are afraid, not because they are happy or calm. Being competitive doesn’t make people “better”. It makes people nervous, angry, and depressed. Competitors only feel appreciated for what they look like on the outside and for what they are doing, then attack other people socially because they are in pain over not developing an honest, humble personality.\n\nIt’s time for human beings to wake up and end war and human authority for good. It has no place here. Violence and social elitism is jealousy and anger resulting from the competitive nature of human beings. Human beings that do not believe in love, focus on self worth, have a desire to heal in life, or learn to respect other people socially will always remain competitive, forceful, shallow, dishonest, and aggressive.\n\nAll people appreciate personality, warmth, and humor the most - not what other people DO to show off and impress people socially. That is just being real. Men and women either believe in love, or they do not believe in themselves.\n\nWe are all spiritual beings. We are all psychic. Live the truth and heal self and others socially. It is the only way forward.", "score": -4, "replies": [{"body": "I agree, TSLA TO THE MOOOOON!", "score": 4, "replies": []}]}]}

Even the much maligned Solar business is up 46% YoY despite ongoing glass roof challenges. Insurance is just getting started. Just these composite businesses are growing at a rate that most investors would be climbing all over as a standalone startup company. \n\nEven if Tesla were just an automotive company, sales almost doubled in a declining overall auto market, they out performed most established automakers in terms of navigating supply chain issues and ended the year having demonstrated a 1.2m annualised production rate. That’s even before the two new factories they’ve spent the past 18 months building in Austin and Berlin are switched on to easily double that capacity when ramped. \n\nJust based on the above businesses alone and their growth trajectories, the stock is worth it’s current value and could easily double this year based on little more than execution and production capacity. And it would still be worth that valuation. \n\nWhy? Because production capacity will ultimately dictate who wins the most market share. Be that cars, batteries, chargers, they’ve built it all. Go look at the production targets for any other manufacturer - it’s pretty bleak. \nRegulation will dictate end of ICE, followed quickly by consumer behaviour as seen in Norway. Furthermore, manufacturing execution will ultimately dictate who profits. Gross margin is already industry leading and growing driven by efficiencies in production, both from China as primary export location and from retooling the lines for older S/X models to use underbody castings for more cost effectively assembly, meaning even Fremont built cars are using new more efficient platforms at higher margin than before. \n\nPerhaps you hadn’t noticed, but on top of all of the above other businesses they’re now building their own battery cells and have constructed three new battery factories (Kato, Austin, Berlin) in the past 2 years. Now they just have to turn those on while the rest of the industry scramble to work out how to get enough scraps from battery manufacturers and build factories fast enough to build a tenth of what Telsa will be able to pump out themselves in future. \n\nFocusing on the fact the stock has a market cap worth more than other automakers is absolutely meaningless. Most automakers today do little more than assemble outsourced parts from 3rd parties vs the vertically integrated approach of Tesla, as such they produce cars more slowly, make lower margins and are 5-10 years behind where Telsa is today on everything from battery cell supply to software. Some will catch up, a lot won’t.\n\nThe robotaxi is late? So what? That isn’t even priced in yet.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Energy and solar are low P/E businesses. Take a look at the valuations in these sectors. As far as batteries go, there are plenty of other players. The reason traditional automakers go with suppliers is because those suppliers can specialize and share components between many companies to achieve lower prices. The vertically integrated approach is fine too, but don't think that it will result in so much more efficiency. Keep in mind, it's much easier to grow when you are small. Getting to 1.2 million units is solid, no question about it, but Toyota is doing over 6 times that on a bad year. Demand will saturate for the narrow product and price range that Tesla sells to. The battery stuff is great, but change change very quickly when new types of batteries come into the fold. Packing thousands of 18650 cells together will not forever be way to go. Batteries are also produced by many companies and are not quite a commodity, but close. It's a solid growing company, but the current valuation is based on unreasonable growth assumptions and no recognition of margin compression as the EV market matures.

Toyota is a decade late to the party and already dead. It isn’t just about ability, it’s about booked capacity or factory space.\n\nI agree on battery packaging and Tesla moved on from 18650s five years ago for all but the S/X, they have already moved again past the 2170s for the 3/Y standard range vehicles to prismatic LFP. Long range vehicles will shortly move to 4680 and that is the battery which unlocks the energy density to weight needed for every other vehicle from semi to roadster to cybertruck. The growth assumptions aren’t unreasonable at all, there are >250k cybertruck orders alone, demand isn’t an issue. \n\nIt’s all there to see both in earnings documents and construction drone videos where you can literally identify the factory floor space and equipment delivered.

It's a super complex industry so no shame with that. Most semi bulls on Reddit speak with confidence but they really don't know shit and are simply trading momentum. Buying semi equities on the way up and selling them on the way down (always being late on both sides). I also always remember what Buffet said, to paraphrase it, there are always amazing opportunities in the market from cocoa beans to Russian rubles but if you don't understand these things there is no reason to get involved. Eventually something you understand will come along and you'll make some good money.\n\nHaving that said, if you put your mind to it you can of course understand anything so if you find it truly interesting don't give up. Although, word of caution, semis is notoriously cyclical industry, it always has been and it always will be so you have to be super careful right now as most semi equities are at multi year highs. And of course people will say that this time is different because of this or that but it never is.\n\nI have this framework in my mind where I divide semis equities in these buckets. Equipment vendors; companies that make the equipment to make the chips like AMAT, LAM, ASML and many others. I completely avoid this bucket and this is the most cyclical and the hardest to understand one. Then another bucket is high end semiconductors. So its things like CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs and equities like AMD, INTC, TSMC, etc. These are cutting edge chips and generally I tend to avoid these with some exceptions. Then another bucket is analog chips. These are basic chips that you would have in your car and in your toaster. They are old legacy chips that are absolutely essential to modern life. Examples of these equities are TXN, ADI, NXP and similar. I really like these equities and always look for market correction to pick some of these up. Then there is semi software so stuff like AVGO, CDNS, SNPS. I will admit I find these hard to understand but they are such insanely profitable companies that I'm working on my research so that when market corrects I know which one to pick up.\n\nSo this is very brief overview of my framework without going into too much details. If you find this industry interesting go do some reading and it could be quite rewarding intellectually and money wise. However, you cannot rely on random Reddit guys guiding you.
