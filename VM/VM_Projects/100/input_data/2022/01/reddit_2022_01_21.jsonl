This is signaling a recession. This was what was going on with the bond markets the other day, what this means is the FED/BigMoney is pulling out. That's why we're seeing a correction. Moving money into oil most likely or other actual assets. The natural yield curve has probably been inverted for a while, but the short end of the curve has been artificially suppressed by the Fed. We're just starting to see it now that they are tapering.\n\nDoesn't mean freak out just yet or anything, but definitely think about being a bit more guarded if you are bullish. I would watch all of the banks to see what happens with them, definitely the European banks aswell. If things get really bad, you could see a domino effect.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ivcvu7l9mxc81.png?width=1157&format=png&auto=webp&s=d71150ebe14ae44ed799e5e6e183fa6f788a3ef9\n\n*Personally,* ***I am growing bearish*** *over all of this and just want to get it all over with. I will be looking at SPY/QQQ puts tomorrow. If we go up in the morning like we did today for that fake out, I will grab some at roughly the 0.20-0.30 cent range. Usually the calls/puts within a 5 dollar range work for this since that is the ATR SPY puts out. It's hard to tell today without knowing how tomorrow will be, but usually the ones worth that much at the top end up flying 500-1000% 0dte. I am going to try to wait till we have a +2 std dev move upward/downward before I grab them. Don't know if the morning fake out will get us that high, but also this play can be reversed if for some reason we start moving upwards. Set stop losses. Move them up right off the rip when you are in the green. Don't get greedy. Do this and* ***YOU WILL MAKE A PROFIT*** *even if you get stopped out. If you get stopped out. Wait, and rebuy another option.*\n\nThis play is also separate in relation to the above mentioned stuff. I am buying options regardless of what happens.\n\n**This is an extremely risky play and I do not recommend you jump into this if you are not familiar with how 0dte options work.**\n\nI am only going to throw a few hundred at this and see what happens. It's been working out great all week so far though. Be aware tomorrow is Option Expiration for LEAPS that were bought 2 years ago.\n\nToday we closed at an important MA line on most major stocks, a critical one, some even below. Tomorrow is opex, playing options could be very risky tomorrow with everything.\n\nStay frosty boys and girls.\n\nEDIT: Update with the SPY chart I am using.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qy7i7kopeyc81.png?width=1276&format=png&auto=webp&s=b4fa25525e6f18ef72506e6a7ebaaad49423506f\n\nEDIT UPDATE 1-21-2022 9:36 am (GMT Texas time)\n\nThis is what I have done so far today,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nrw06y4z92d81.png?width=1219&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b2d787f62c1e2d8f9d878d5c44ccb13dcd0cbca\n\nEDIT 2: 10:00am (Texas GMT time) 440 spy calls now up like 400% or something.

This is not well-reasoned, risk-managed trading; this is gambling.  I was running straddles on SPY and making small gains while the market traded sideways, but some of my stocks were dragging me down slowly.  I finally got rid of some of the baggage (take your losses folks), and started making a little money.  Then this week the market began a stronger downturn, and I felt safe enough to buy straight puts.\n\nUsually I've been buying 1-2 wks out in early January, but this week I've run a few 1 - 0 dte puts.  I've been putting 10+% of may account at risk on a single SPY play, which I DO NOT recommend.  It's only paying off while the market is falling, and I've been lucky a few times like at close today.  I've also lost a few too.  I only lost $300 a SPY 469 straddle that I put 6K in, and it honestly felt like a win because it was down so hard while SPY meandered along sideways a couple of weeks ago.  Too big a bet for that type of market action.  I should've known better.\n\nOther than SPY plays like this, I've been buying some puts on smaller banks that don't look like they're going to make earnings.  They are very cheap, and you can get lots of leverage, but be sure there's enough volume there that you can sell 'em when the time is right.  By sizing these trades at 1 to 1-1/2% of my account I'm not taking on too much risk if I lose, and the payoffs have been good.  For example bought 100 HBAN 1/21 16P on Tuesday for 0.05 each.  Sold them this morning for $1. That's +9.5K, and I gotta say I was pretty happy about it.  I've had a few losers, but it doesn't hurt much as long as I'm keeping the size down on these ones.  They're less certain than what's going on with SPY.  As others have said on this forum, earnings plays are very risky, so you don't want to go big.  Better to spread it around on many candidates.  If the market starts to recover, or we rotate to a different sector, this is all out the window.  You have to keep track of what the market is doing so you can pick your spots.\n\nI'm definitely not a professional, and many of these trades are high risk.  Please do your own DD and don't YOLO.

{"title": "Intel to Invest at Least $20 Billion in New Chip Factories in Ohio", "selftext": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/21/technology/intel-chip-factories-ohio.html\n\nIntel has selected Ohio for a new chip manufacturing complex that would cost at least $20 billion, ramping up an effort to increase U.S. production of computer chips as users grapple with a lingering shortage of the vital components.\n\nIntel said Friday that the new site near Columbus would initially have two chip factories and would directly employ 3,000 people, while creating additional jobs in construction and at nearby businesses.\n\nPatrick Gelsinger, who became Intel’s chief executive last year, has rapidly increased the company’s investments in manufacturing to help reduce U.S. reliance on foreign chip makers while lobbying Congress to pass incentives aimed at increasing domestic chip production. He has said that Intel might invest as much as $100 billion over a decade in its next U.S. manufacturing campus, linking the scope and speed of that expansion to expected federal grants if Congress approves a spending package known as the CHIPS Act.\n\n“We will go bigger and broader if it gets funded,” Mr. Gelsinger, 60, said in a recent interview. “But our recovery plans don’t rely on the CHIPS act.”\n\nPresident Biden will meet with Mr. Gelsinger at the White House on Friday to discuss the project, Intel said. Administration officials have aggressively pushed the CHIPS Act.\n\nIntel’s move has geopolitical implications, as well as significance for supply chains. Chips, which act as the brains of computers and many other devices, are largely manufactured in Taiwan, which China has expressed territorial claims toward.

He estimated wealth losses could total $35 trillion in the U.S. should valuations across major asset classes return two-thirds of the way to historical norms. \n\n“One of the main reasons I deplore superbubbles — and resent the Fed and other financial authorities for allowing and facilitating them — is the underrecognized damage that bubbles cause as they deflate,” said Grantham.\n\nThe Federal Reserve doesn’t seem to “get” asset bubbles, said Grantham, pointing to the “ineffably massive stimulus for COVID” (some of which he said was necessary) that followed stimulus to recover from the bust of the 2006 housing bubble. “The only ‘lesson’ that the economic establishment appears to have learned from the rubble of 2009 is that we didn’t address it with enough stimulus,” he said. Equity bubbles tend to begin to deflate from the riskiest parts of the market first — as the one that Grantham is warning about has been doing since February 2021, according to his paper. “So, good luck!” he wrote. “We’ll all need it.”\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/good-luck-well-all-need-it-u-s-market-approaches-end-of-superbubble-says-jeremy-grantham-11642723516?mod=home-page](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/good-luck-well-all-need-it-u-s-market-approaches-end-of-superbubble-says-jeremy-grantham-11642723516?mod=home-page)", "id": "s9hjb5", "created_utc": 1642790083.0, "score": 1397, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 677, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 335, "replies": [{"body": "Same situation.

It’s a good foundation I guess for a Reddit argument, but I believe it will be less than 10% over the next 30 year period.  Within the ballpark of 7-10, and the low end adjusted for inflation is my 5.\n\nSure. But it would be pretty precedent breaking for the last century of the stock market to suddenly perform absolutely poorly for decades on end. It's also worthless speculating on since even if we did all the research odds are still high we'd be wrong.\n\nSo the best predictor is to just run on historical averages imo and call it a day. If we're wrong, we're wrong.\n\n>Assuming you are correct and the end pile is 1.1mil in todays dollars that’s still an extremely meager lifestyle to die on but at least it’s not the poverty line right?\n\nI mean that's about 40k a year to live on or what someone with a 60k pre tax salary lives on. It's not luxury and mansions but it's stable. You're probably going to have a decent house or apartment enough food in the pantry and enough income to buy more, a solid economy car that can get you to where you want to go and no day to day worries about ending up on the streets, and some side cash to enjoy your retirement years.\n\nIf you include a weak social security estimate of say only 500 bucks a month in today's cash that turns that into about 46k a year. You'll be doing just fine and will be done with the rat race. Hell if you decide to move to a LCOL area or somewhere a bit less urban then you can live pretty well on 40-46k a year.\n\nHowever here's where the fun begins. I'm only assuming you just barely max out your ROTH IRA going forward and nothing else. If you can double those contributions to say 1k a month then [your 70k becomes 1.7 mil](https://www.calculator.net/investment-calculator.html?ctype=endamount&ctargetamountv=1000000&cstartingprinciplev=70000&cyearsv=30&cinterestratev=7&ccompound=annually&ccontributeamountv=1000&cadditionat1=end&ciadditionat1=monthly&printit=0&x=42&y=33) in today's cash which gives you an effective living income of about 60ish thousand dollars a year.

That's the same life style someone with a 6 figure pre tax salary can afford.\n\nIt's all the power of compound interest and DCA. You'll definitely be doing better in those scenarios than someone relying on government programs tbh. I used to sell to those folks  at my last job. I can tell you they're not doing well and are spending their end years scrimping and saving on budget consumer cellular phone plans with a crappy 40 dollar android planning every dollar so they can eat that night and not go hungry next week.\n\nEDIT: All of these also assume no CPI wage increases and is not adjusting your savings dollar amount for inflation.

For every fat cat you have 10 dudes going broke on a bad business plan and working for the man even longer and 5 people who get no further than small business giving them enough to get by or serving them moderately well.\n\nI'm all for extra risk but especially right now I don't think a business is a good idea.

To detail:\r  \n\r  \n**First**, we are indeed participating in the broadest and most extreme global real estate bubble in history. Today houses in the U.S. are at the highest multiple of family income ever, after a record 20% gain last year, ahead even of the disastrous housing bubble of 2006. But although the U.S. housing market is selling at a high multiple of family income, it is less, sometimes far less, than many other countries, e.g., Canada, Australia, the U.K., and especially China. (In China, real estate has played an unusually important and unique role in the extended boom and thereby poses an equally unique risk to the economy and hence the rest of the world if its real estate market loses air exactly as it appears to be doing as we sit.)\r  \n\r  \n**Second**, we have the most exuberant, ecstatic, even crazy investor behavior in the history of the U.S. stock market. The U.S. market today has, in my opinion, the greatest buy-in ever to the idea that stocks only go up, which is surely the real essence of a bubble. (Interestingly, where other developed countries lead in housing prices, they lag the U.S. in equity prices. Some, such as Japan, by so much that they are merely slightly overpriced today.)\r  \n\r  \n**Third**, as if this were not enough, we also have the highest-priced bond markets in the U.S. and most other countries around the world, and the lowest rates, of course, that go with them, that human history has ever seen.\r  \n\r  \nAnd **fourth**, as gravy (as if we needed any) we have broadly overpriced, or above trend, commodities including oil and most of the important metals. In addition, the UN’s index of global food prices is around its all-time high (see Exhibit 2). These high prices are important as they push inflation and stress real incomes.

But the real answer is that people that are interested in only the headline rides are going to need to buy a 15$ 'Genie +' pass to do them all in a day. It's basically the same as FastPass, but now monitized. While $15 dollars isn't cheap it is not expensive compared to the ticket price.\n\nFastPass (and now genie+) is a system where you can 'virtually' wait in one line. So if the line is 90 minutes long, you would be assigned a ride time 90m in the future and then you just show up and ride. In the meantime you could wait in another line, eat lunch, whatever. It just barely makes it possible to go on nearly all the rides in a given park even on busy days.\n\nBut to go back to my initial thought - I think that most people going to Disney are happy doing a few rides, eating in the park, walking around, doing a little shopping, and only a certain type of guest is unhappy if they cant do every ride. And all those things make way more money than the rides anyways.

A straight naked call, short strangle, or Jade Lizard are examples of that kind of trade. Risk is unlimited here because a stock can theoretically rise to infinity, but it can only go to $0.\n\nThe theoretical *capital* risk on a naked short put is the strike price minus the premium received from selling the put, multipled by 100, multiplied by the number of contracts you sold, it's not unlimited/undefined. And even if you do get assigned, you get shares of stock out of it, so you would realistically **never** see max loss on a naked put unless the stock falls to $0.\n\nIn any case, you can also buy back the short legs on these options or roll them to a later expiration date to mitigate loss.\n\nAlso, vertical, calendar, and other types of spreads are defined-risk (not unlimited/undefined) strategies that involve combining a short and long leg.

I, Dave, and a few others were some of the OGs at Tesla Motors Club who bought TSLA shares in 2011-2012, when everyone else couldn't understand the company and thought it was doomed.  \n\nI'm in the same camp as Chicken, Dave, and Tom and own PLTR (about 2% of my portfolio cost basis in the 23.xx range).\n\nI understand what Palantir is building: a (1) generalized software platform (2) that can be quickly deployed (3) over an organization's existing information technology systems (4) in order to give decision makers a birds-eye view as to what is going on within their organization.\n\nThis theoretically should enable much greater business efficiencies because decisionmakers will be able to better spot bottlenecks, diagnose problems, and get the jump on potential future problems.  Right now, many leaders in private enterprise and government often don't have accurate, up to date information about what exactly is going on in their organizations, because there's a mishmash of isolated systems cobbled together.\n\nPalantir's software platform has no direct competitors.  The company has over 2.3 Billion in cash, zero debt, and should generate about 400 million in free cash flow for 2021.\n\nI rate Palantir as a potentially generational company, with a maturity level approximately similar to Tesla in the 2014-2018 period, though with substantially less financial risk (there's almost no chance they go bankrupt).\n\nTesla is a more secure bet right now, since they are actually profitable.

So where I’m looking right now, a 360k home is now 480k. People are not going to take hits or sell for a loss, so they, at worse will do what they did in 2009, hood and buckle down, if they have to move, rent - until they recover.

I've also owned stocks and other investments over the past decade, and the house has returned the least capital to me. Quite literally the wealthiest couple I know who take home well into the seven figures a year rent and have never owned.\n\nAs someone who remembers the last housing boom well, I can tell you that these debates come up every time there's a boom in the housing market. Last time around, after the crash there was a whole minimalist movement where the wise thing to do was to get rid of everything and just live like a nomad. Funny that I don't recall too many people falling over themselves to buy houses back in 2019 when prices and interest rates were low. Now people consider owning a house an iron-clad case.\n\nTo share another anecdote, there's a couple that I know who owns a house in Florida that they bought about five years ago that has roughly doubled in value on paper.

While the assessed value has gone way up and they're millionaires on paper, so too has their home owner's insurance which is now nearly $10k a year. They've had to cut back on expenses to pay for upkeep and insurance.\n\nMy point by the way, was never that owning a home is inherently bad or stupid, just that it's absolutely false that it's always a better choice than renting. This should be self-evident. If buying real estate guaranteed profits, everyone would just buy. Companies would build their own offices instead of leasing them. In reality, it's possible there's been no industry that's bankrupted more people than real estate.\n\nIn the current environment where housing prices have jumped, all of a sudden everyone believes renting is stupid. It's absolutely no different than people rushing to buy stocks at a market top. The mentality is exactly the same, the only thing that tends to save most people from catastrophic losses is the fact that houses are very illiquid and so prices don't fluctuate very often. Actually, now I would argue that renting is a much better deal. If you were to buy a house that costs $500k and put 20% down, you're giving up $100k that could right now be earning 7+% a year interest. Instead you've sunk that money into a non cash-producing asset AND paying 7-8% interest on a $400k mortgage + repairs + lack of mobility + insurance and everything else I pointed out that comes with home ownership.\n\nIf you own and you're happy with it, great.

If you are renting, you have to pay something every month for where you live, same as the mortgage. the difference is with the mortgage it is a more consistent monthly payment over time. Every so often the monthly cost if you have a mortgage might change a bit due to property taxes or insurance, but outside of that the mortgage payment is a fairly steady price. Rent on the other hand, is something that will change a lot more dramatically over time. For example, in 1991 the Median rent (half of people pay more than this number half of people pay less than this number) was around $460. fast foward 30 years to today, the median rent in the US is now around $1100. that is almost 2.5X the original rent cost.\n\nNow obviously a lot of things factor into that and can change the exact numbers a bit (average size of homes being rented over time, exact location in the US could change things, average salary over time has changed so the numbers feel different now, etc) but if you get a mortgage for $1000 a month right now, you will not be paying $2500 for the mortgage 30 years from now, you will still be fairly close to $1000 per month unless big changes happened like you did a cash out refinance or sold and bought a new home.\n\nthere are a lot of pros and cons to home buying, if it makes sense in your situation it can save you a ton in the long run. you can find a lot of calculators online to help you find out if it is worth it in your situation.\n\n>How are people affording homes right now?\n\nA lot of them are not. A lot of people buy a home in cash, but then turn around and take out a mortgage oln the home because they could not afford to give up that much cash at one time.\n\nother people get gifts from family members. a lot of older people with fat wallets give their kids/grandkids gifts of thousands of dollars to make the purchase possible.\n\nOther people are simply taking out more than they can afford, not realizing that a $3K monthly salary will not pay for a $1500 mortgage payment\n\nA lot of the homes being sold get bought by companies who are investing in real estate and rent the homes out\n\nother homes get bought by people who already own a home and want an investment property where they rent it out. If they dont have cash available right now, they just take out some equity from the home they already own and use that as the down payment and closing costs.\n\nother people are just lucky enough to have a good job that affords them the ability to buy a home.\n\nand others still bought before prices shot up in the past few years. if i bought a home for 300K 5 years ago, and its worth 800K now, i still only owe the 300K i borrowed to buy the home. and if i sell the home, i get to pocket the 500K and can use that as the down payment on a new home meaning my new mortgage will also not be that large.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you for your reply.

A hedge is merely anything that counteracts potential bigger losses.  Straddles and coverered calls are other examples of hedges that dont apply to owned assets.  It's a legitimate usage of the word.  Having your money in a 2.5% mortgage IS a hedge against 7% inflation.  Instead of losing 7%/yr by having your money in cash, putting my money into a low interest rate mortgage allows you to only lose 2.5%/year. (And 90% of the time also enjoy the increased equity to hedge even further against my assets losing cale as well).    \n\nThe 2008 housing crash was caused  primarily by the rise of predatory lending and products with exotic features marketed to consumers without adequate information or preparation and sometimes using fraudulent information, as well as the failure of the PLS market.  It had nothing to do with \"People bought a bunch of houses which drove prices up, then they couldn't afford them because of economic factors so they sold them en masse so the housing market crashed which helped further tank the economy.\".   Comparing 2008 housing crash to today, you'll find very little of the circumstances causing it exist in today's housing market.  (Other than high prices, which is just a result of basic supply and demand forces).   Everyone wants to buy (because low interest loans plus increased equity *are* a hedge against inflation), and no one want to sell, because everyone and their mother is now locked in around 3% and prices keep going up.  Rising interest rates will keep prices from going up much more in the immediate future, and they may even come down a little.  It's not about to crash like 08 again though.  The variables in place that caused that crash just arent around today.   If unemployment goes way up, it could cause more people to sell and affect prices negatively some too, but again nothing like 2008.  They're apples and oranges.\n\nI have a 186k loan on a house I bought for 236k 3 years ago.  Worth 370k now.  Before I refinanced, the P+I was 1030.  That was at 4.9%.  Now at 2.5% its 780/mo.  I worked in the mortgage industy last year and can tell you that I'm not THAT much of an outlier in terms of my rate.  Most of america is locked in now around 3-4%.  And they're not selling either.  Its gonna take massive unemployment, massive interest rate increases, and massive increases in inventory to see prices ever precipitously drop again...", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "The dictionary also defines a hedge as a shrub. \n\nHere's a definition from a [relevant source.](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hedge.asp) Straddles and covered calls are also assets. I'm not sure why you're debating the semantics. You're 100% wrong. It's not something you can debate.\n\nYes. Exactly. In 2008, \"Predatory lending\" allowed people to buy houses they couldn't afford which drove prices up.  Then people couldn't pay their mortgages and the housing market collapsed.  \n\nPresently, trillions of free dollars were given out to people when mortgage rates were artificially low which allowed them to buy houses they couldn't afford that they didn't have to pay mortgages on for a year because of forbearance. So that drove prices up. \n\nNow that forbearance is over, the free money is gone, student loan payments are coming back, the child tax credit is gone, if inflation persists, the stock market tanks, the housing market tanks, a recession ensues, and people who bought houses at all-time highs lose their jobs, they can't pay for their mortgages and the housing market collapses.\n\nI didn't say the crash will be on par with '08. You said that. You're making a straw man argument, trying to prove that something I never said is wrong. You're right. It's wrong to say it's the exact same thing but I never said that.\n\nMy thesis is the housing market will crash because people won't be able to afford mortgages. \n\nThat's apples to apples.\n\nYou think it will \"come down a bit\" and also see the same contributing factors I'm talking about. So it sounds like you agree and I just have a more extreme point of view. Fair enough.\n\nIf you don't think that the price (which is not the value) of your house going up 56% in three years is a red flag that we're looking at more than a small price correction, then check out this [graph](https://www.whitehouse.gov/cea/written-materials/2021/09/09/housing-prices-and-inflation/), which doesn't include the 2021/2022 stats (when all the free money hit the market) makes things pretty obvious that this is not normal and has to correct.\n\nThe stock market going up 500%+ in the last ten years (and 40% in one year) isn't normal either. It went up 500%+ right before the 1929 crash for a reason.\n\nWorking in mortgages for a year doesn't mean you know the market, Opinions based on anecdotal evidence just don't hold weight. Facts are facts. I'm going to go with FINRA and hard housing market data on this. \n\nIf you're want to say things like \"Most of America is locked in at 3-4% right now\" you have to prove it. And, if you average out the last 20 years of rates, it's well about 4%. [Do the math if you want](http://www.freddiemac.com/pmms/pmms30.html). \n\nThat aside, mortgages are taken out each year. They mature each year. That means mortgages are renegotiated each year. Lots have shorter terms than 30 years. Rates are climbing. Mortgages are getting more expensive. No one is going to refi at 2.5% for a long time.\n\nThis market cannot sustain and will see a huge correction. My house went up 40% in a single year. That shouldn't happen and will have to balance out.

I know I'm right and you seem to think you know you are.  Let's move on.  \n\nYour thesis that people wont be able to afford their mortgages in the future just doesn't hold up.  The reason people couldnt afford their mortgages in 2008 was primarily because of predatory lending practices, and the huge number of ARMS, which simply are not happening now.  If people can pay their mortgages right now, they are going to be able to pay those same mortgages in the future, unless massive unemployment happens.  As far as future NEW mortgages go, yes they will be at a higher rate than today, but Fannie May and underwriters have much stricter rules about qualifying for loans now thanks to the 2008 crash, to hopefully keep that from happening again.  I owned a house back in 2000-2003 as well, and it went from 250k-450k in 3 years, while rates were almost double digits.  My parents bought houses in the 70's, 89's and 90's at MUCH higher rates than today, and they STILL kept going up in price.  It wasn't until the predatory leaning practices of the mid 2000's that shit crashed.  \n\nJust because something goes way up in price doesnt always mean its overvalued and will come down.  Its valued exactly at what the market says it's worth.  Right now, houses are worth that much because people are willing to pay that much, and as long as they qualify for the loan, they should be able to keep paying that much for the lifetime of the loan.  The only thing that will change that is massive unemployment or massive increase in housing, or massive rate hikes on new mortgages.  \n\nI'm ok if my house drops 50% in value or even goes underwater, because my mortgage payments are locked in at 780/mo.

{"title": "The Fed is about to commit a disasterous policy mistake.", "selftext": "Long post warning, but there is a lot on my mind this morning.\n\nWhat a predicament. In the 4th quarter of last year, I predicted the 1st quarter of 2022 would bring volatility and devaluation to financial markets. So far, this appears to have been correct. Aside from the technical indicators showing visible cracks, there are true macroeconomic and monetary policy concerns.\n\nFirstly, inflation soared 7% in 2021, which is the highest rate in over four decades. What makes this more troubling is the current calculations for inflation are inherently flawed, resulting in under reporting. This is primarily due to the “owners equivalent rent” category being substituted in lieu of actual home prices, which differs from the late 1970’s, early 1980’s model. If you calculate inflation under the old model, inflation is considerably higher. Inflation is great for equities, so long as corporations can pass on increased supplier costs to consumers. The spread between PPI and CPI shows this isn’t happening on the broad scale. Margins are compressing.\n\nSecondly, the Fed’s primary tool to combat inflation is tightening monetary policy via reduction in QE, rate hikes, and eventually balance sheet runoff. Problem is, the Fed is forecasting three to four rate hikes in 2022. My questions to Jerome Powell: How do you expect a 1% rise in rates to offset negative real yields that are currently at -6% to -7%? This likely isn’t enough to curb inflation. Remember, Paul Volker had to to raise rates to 20% plus once inflation became entrenched in the economy. Secondly, with the 2-year and 10-year spread sitting around 0.85%, is the Fed really planning on hiking rates to the point it results in a yield curve inversion? I highly doubt it, but they have made many terrible decisions throughout the years.\n\nLastly, don’t let these politicians fool you by talking about retail sales numbers, the unemployment rate, and other “success” stories. Adjust December 2021 retail sales for inflation and you will see the numbers were abysmal. Adjust the unemployment rate for the drop in the Labor Force Participation Rate, and you will see we are not at historic lows.\n\nThe financial markets are about to go (already happening to a degree) into a tantrum because the Fed is telling us they want to tighten monetary policy in a weak economy (under the surface), which could result in a yield curve inversion (almost always preceding a recession in 6 to 24 months), and despite there efforts, it is entirely possible inflation continues to plow forward. The recipe for stagflation is in the Fed’s cookbook and the cookbook is on the counter.\n\nProblem is, the Fed is out of viable options and they know it.

Right now the issue is retail demand which is leading to high prices, and Covid sick penalties which is wreaking havoc with the supply chain for retail the world around. Not to mention that spot shipping, traditionally used by industries to order parts has been bought up by retail as well.  Same story, it’s all due to Covid and the US Gov handouts that didn’t go to where it was needed, and went everywhere. \n\nWhat the economy needs is for retail demand to subside and for services to take some of that load. That can’t happen until Covid disappears, so the economy is going to be stuck in volatility until a way forward is determined.\n\nThat way forward isn’t all interest rate hikes. Xi has been showing the world that policies are just as effective to cool down markets.. to the point that China is now lowering interest rates, which is deflationary pressure on retail goods coming out of China. \n\nThe Fed doesn’t have to hike rates like a madman, they only need to appear to be combating inflation, so modest rate hikes, preceded by very aggressive end to QE, and then unloading treasuries when it makes sense. The reason is because unlike the 80’s, the amount of debt in the market is massive, a modest hike with a stance for more will have a large trigger on reducing exposure to volatile assets (like the riskiest of tech venture speculating stocks that aren’t making money today), house prices across the board (as high house prices are hit hardest by interest rate increases). It also curtails risky investment by businesses and reduces (eliminates) those jobs that are borderline necessary for the businesses. \n\nFed rate increases have a lag effect on the economy when they’re implemented. Meaning that their effect isn’t felt for at least a quarter. So a modest increase in rates now, will have an effect this spring/summer, which will coincide with continued improvement in retail supply chains, the dry-up in capital (stimulus) we’re experiencing now in the market, and the likely change from Covid being a pandemic to an endemic, which switches retail demand to services. \n\nSo Powell’s thesis on transitory rates is intact, it just depends on Covid being finished for it to come true. There are now Covid cures, Covid vaccines in pill form, and a slew of new treatments. So Covid is over, it just doesn’t know it yet. \n\nThink about the inflationary talk recently as well. The Fed last talked about this in December. Since then the media took 3 rate hikes in 2022 and increased it to 7, with multiple point increments. This is ridiculous, the press is whipping up a frenzy based on speculation. So the press is being influenced by a few bad actors who wanted to see the market dip… and they brought about the result by spreading fear and lies.\n\nCovid also did that thing that Republicans have been railing about for decades. Those expats that live in other countries.. they moved to the US for Covid, they’ll likely go back home when it’s over. Similarly, there are likely many rich foreign national’s that are doing the same, they’ll likely be going back home afterwards as well. Everything in the market is determined by Covid, so it’s likely that it’s resolution will have an impact.  Atm though, we’re balls deep in omicron and the Fed has been mum for over a month and it’s led to some bad actors getting air-time, with politics also whipping up inflationary fears because it serves the republicans efforts in defeating Biden and the Dems.

Why the fuck would you pay for this if you get 1 like a week\n\nTinder gold: $25 a month to see who likes you. LMAO what guy buys a $25 a month subscription to a DATING APP where most guys only match with fat girls. Girls don’t need tinder gold since the app favors them. \n\nTinder plat: $29 a month or $90 for 6 months. Who the fuck pays for this shit. Seriously the jokes write themselves. Absolutely INSANE price tags.\n\nHinge has similar prices. Look them up. Insane monthly prices. \n\nSo now guys don’t just pay for the first date, you pay $25 to just talk to the girl and then pay for the first date. Not lasting very long. \n\n\nTell me with a straight face that MATCH is a $120 stock when you can’t get more than 2 likes a week and your 2 likes are from fat women 20 miles away.

Obviously play this at your own risk, not financial advice\n\nEdit: it’s hilarious how you guys think this stock is safe. 61p/e at $120 a share. Snapchat tanked, Netflix tanked, Adobe tanked. Adobe and Netflix are way more reputable than match. There’s no reason this would be safe.\n\nEdit2: remember guys, earnings isn’t until 2/1. Plenty of time to get a position. Don’t rush into a put (or call if you’re inversing) with low OI and get fucked.\n\nEdit3: let’s not forget apple gets 30% of their subscription revenue.

I think the best entry was actually when I posted this dd and the best exit was probably last week when you all said you had profit. Good luck\n\nFinal edit: the play failed.

This is especially true if they need to raise money for Capex. But if you specifically ask that question for Tesla...I doubt it. And this is for very technical reasons related to how they operate their business.  Look at what happened during semi conductor shortage. Most Car companies, hell most tech companies, contracted because of lack of semi conducters. Tesla not only expanded, it crushed optimistic estimates. Why? They were singular in their focus. They planned ahead and had beter mitigation with foresight and deals made in advanced. They were using higher margin chips for more advanced software. They used Vertical integration. All that good stuff.   \n\n\nAs for Capex...Tesla has many billions of dollars of cash on hand and their rate of gaining cash on hand is also expanding despite 50% + growth is deliveries per year. They haven't had to go to the markets to raise money much since they have more than enough from free cash flow alone so their stock price doesn't impact them much. When they do spend money, the company is extremely lean. Most OEM's are spending 10's of billions of dollars to do what Tesla could do in a couple of billion. Part of this is the world-class talen they're able to attract in a way few companies outside of FAANG can. So they basically end up doing more with less. Despite opening up two massive factories in two continents Tesla is spending less money than Rivian this year which is hilarious and something I feel few people realize.   \n\n\nAs for the \"value of the company,\" my estimation of value is based mostly on production and revenue. Tesla will easily expand >50% this year based on their  car volume alone, maybe closer to 100%. Their profit margins, however, are going to be even higher since their fixed costs aren't increasing much. And I forsee as this continuing to play out for years to come since they are no longer financially limited nor demand constraint (as evidenced by price hikes on all of their models and year long waits anyway).
