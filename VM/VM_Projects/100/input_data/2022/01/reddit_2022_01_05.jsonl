{"title": "Should you listen to Jim Cramer? - I analyzed 20,000+ recommendations made by Jim Cramer during the last 5 years. Here are the results.", "selftext": "Jim Cramer has made 21,609 stock picks in the past 5 years! Let that sink in for a moment. Here is one person, making buy/sell/hold recommendations on more than 2,200+ different stocks across all types of industries. On average, he was making more than 20 picks per episode of his show \\[1\\]. This is a staggering number of picks to be made by one person! \\[2\\]\n\nWhile we can all argue about his expertise in making recommendations on such a wide array of industries and companies, what I wanted to know was:\n\n1. **How accurate were his recommendations?**\n2. **Would you have made or lost money if you followed them?**\n3. **Can you beat the market following his picks?**\n\nSo it’s high time that we put Cramer to the ultimate test and end the debate about his usefulness once and for all!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xethcdd2fv981.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=17c64b3059d57df22d9468b0803fd781f12b5e18\n\n**Analysis**\n\nThe data about all the stock picks made by Cramer are available [here](https://madmoney.thestreet.com/screener/index.cfm) \\[3\\]. The picks are classified into five segments (Buy, Hold, Sell, Positive/Negative mention). I have calculated the return for each segment separately \\[4\\] so that we can know what to focus on if we are trying to replicate this strategy.\n\nSince Cramer frequently contradicts his own picks and is mainly focused on short-term trades, I am only analyzing the stock returns for the following periods \\[5\\].\n\na. One-day\n\nb. One-Week\n\nc. One-Month\n\nGiven that Mad Money (Cramer’s Show) airs after the market closes, I have used the opening price of the next day for my calculations. (I.e If Cramer makes a recommendation on Thursday night, I use Friday opening price as the base for my calculations)\n\nAll the data used in the calculations are shared at the end.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0x2ikwd2fv981.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d2fb94ba1af493740362bb939e13743b8160237\n\n**Results**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7mbvwrh4fv981.png?width=775&format=png&auto=webp&s=ba4edaf25fc2287a0b5700540e989b8662b43bd1\n\n1-day performance of Cramer’s recommendations is excellent! On average, the Buy and Positive mention stocks went up by 0.03 and 0.05% respectively, and sell and negative mention stocks went down by 0.1 and 0.02%.\n\nAnother interesting fact is that ***you would not have lost money*** if you followed Cramer’s Buy recommendations. Across the time periods, his Buy recommendations have on average netted you positive returns \\[6\\]!\n\nHis sell recommendations did not pan out so well. Even though they dropped in price the next day, over the next week and month, they returned inline or even better than his buy recommendations!\n\nGiven that there is a counter-intuitive trend in the returns, let’s calculate the accuracy of his calls.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u24my9f5fv981.png?width=792&format=png&auto=webp&s=7070ae9b8f8db4cf3c95430b67c8fa68c03c605b\n\nHere I am assigning a call as correct based on price change. If he gives a buy recommendation, I expect the price to go up and vice versa. As we can see from the chart above, his recommendations only do slightly better than a coin-toss. Even this only holds for short-term and buy recommendations with long-term sell recommendation performance dropping below 50% \\[7\\].\n\nWhile this narrow edge over the 50% mark can be used by algo-traders who have the ability to trade a large amount of stocks, if you are an average investor listening in on a Cramer show and hear about a stock recommendation, you might as well toss a coin to see if you should invest or not!\n\nFinally, it’s time we pit **Cramer against the market**. Do his recommendations beat the market?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4jy8xsb6fv981.png?width=1020&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c73cc998f6e0a5d96e779f28f14a2936f66d273\n\nOh yeah! I was as surprised with the results as you are. I ran the numbers again and then one more time but got the exact same result! Cramer’s Buy recommendations beat the S&P 500 by a factor of 10 for the **one-day time frame**. But, if you held the stocks for anytime longer, you would have underperformed the market significantly.\n\nBefore you go daytrade on his recommendations you should know that the numbers we are seeing here are heavily influenced by outliers. If you miss out on the top 1% of recommendations (\\~110 stocks out of the 11,000+ buy recommendations he had made), your **1-day return would be -0.062% instead of +0.034** \\[8\\].\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eo50hed2fv981.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=60eaa0b7f347eb28a0606aa25c7436b83fa78fb5\n\n**Limitations of the analysis**\n\nThe analysis has some limitations that you should be aware of before trying to replicate the strategy.\n\n1. As the astute among you might have noticed, if you sum up all the stocks used in the analysis it would only come to 18.5k. I removed \\~15% of the overall recommendations as either they did not have stock data present in Yahoo Finance/Alpha Vantage or the price data did not match with the one given on the Mad Money website.\n2. The data is obtained from the Mad Money website itself. I haven’t manually verified if the calls recorded on the website are in fact an accurate representation of the calls made by Cramer in his show. The below statement is given in their description and I am taking them on their word.\n\n>We are impartial in our recording and simply log exactly what was said. We do not interpret the calls. If a call is vague or in question we simply won't list it.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l5cfhxd2fv981.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=5669a311e8067cff01cd4ad304386f059914c610\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nNo matter the public opinion on Cramer, we can generate excellent 1-day returns following his buy recommendations (even beating the market in doing so!). Whether it’s due to his superior stock picking ability or whether it’s simply due to self-fulfilling prophecy \\[9\\] (as he has a wide audience who will act on his advice) is yet to be known.\n\nI would bet on the latter as, if the extraordinary one-day returns were in fact due to his superior stock-picking ability, the returns should have held over longer time periods, and also his sell recommendations would not have ended up performing better than his buy recommendations as we are observing here.\n\nIt only makes sense to listen to his advice if you are a day-trader or an algo-trader who is trading a large variety of stocks over short periods of time. For everyone else, just sticking to the S&P 500 would give you better returns over the long run!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kaentre2fv981.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=ada384d17d797e772764aadd748b11006834625d\n\n**Data**\n\nExcel file containing all the Recommendations and Financial data: [**Here**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1d0mooS_qsfePXChEDq2IDov_of_TFvD1/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=111668650548288730122&rtpof=true&sd=true)\n\n**Live tracker** containing the performance of Cramer’s 2021 picks: [**Here**](https://rows.com/market-sentiment/my-spreadsheets/untitled-spreadsheet-3-5C58Ix9kx1ixB0cM52DWZi/live) \\[10\\] (I will be updating this file regularly so that you can see his performance in real-time whenever you want to!)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u6t0u7f2fv981.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=b277de02f04341e0da7a1d5add24555aa8dac12e\n\n**More Interesting Reads**\n\nFrom this week onwards, I am including one or two blogs or articles I really enjoy and hopefully, you can discover new and interesting content!\n\n[**More to that**](https://moretothat.com/)**:** This is by an illustrator called Lawrence Yeo who breaks down really complicated topics into easy to read articles with fun illustrations. [**The Nothingness of Money**](https://moretothat.com/the-nothingness-of-money/) was one of the best articles I have read last year and if you reading just one article this year, it should be this one (oh, I know this is [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/), but you are going to love this one)!\n\n[**Econometrics**](https://ecoinometrics.substack.com/)**:** If you like the charts I make, you are going to love Econometrics.

[To buy or not to buy](https://ecoinometrics.substack.com/p/ecoinometrics-to-buy-or-not-to-buy) was an excellent article about what is the right time to buy into a dip. The chart below showcases their ability in data visualization and breaking down complex ideas! \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wcddkz1nfv981.png?width=733&format=png&auto=webp&s=14e801f18b2bd62c4b345b2514e1172e4bd65e1f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wnci28g2fv981.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=426895ca97fdc8c7bcecde231480de5318237712\n\n**Footnotes and existing research**\n\n**\\[1\\]** For those who don’t know, Cramer makes his picks in a CNBC show called [Mad Money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Money). Cramer himself defines the show as something which should be used for speculative/high-risk investing and not for your retirement portfolio.\n\n**\\[2\\]** For comparison purposes, an equity research analyst [covers only 10-25 companies](https://whatforwork.com/jobs/equity-research-analyst-sell-side/).\n\n**\\[3\\]** It’s not in an easily usable format. I had to parse the data from the webpage using Python (Beautiful Soup) - I have shared all the data used in this analysis as an Excel and Rows file at the end.\n\n**\\[4\\]** I did not calculate for Hold as he only made 27 hold recommendations, which is lower than what is required for a statistical significance.\n\n**\\[5\\]** In my [last post about Jim Cramer](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mtehdq/i_analyzed_all_700_buy_and_sell_recommendations/), there was a lot of controversy around how I calculated the time period. So here is the detailed version about how the time period is considered. For One-Day returns, we are considering that we will purchase the stock the next trading day after the market opens and then sells it at the end of the trading day. For weekly and monthly returns, I am using adjusted closing price since across a week or month there can be stock splits as well as dividends.\n\n**\\[6\\]** This can also be attributed to the market rally we have experienced over the last 5 years where a large majority of stocks went up.\n\n**\\[7\\]** 50% benchmark might be controversial with a lot of you (I agree given that if we are in a bull market there is more than a 50-50 chance of a stock going up tomorrow) → My rationale here is standing today looking at a stock, there are only two things that can happen tomorrow. It can either go up or go down. I assign equal probability to both given anything can happen tomorrow. The market can turn bearish, positive or negative news about the company can come up, etc. If you have a better logic for a benchmark, please do suggest!\n\n**\\[8\\]** But to be fair to Cramer, this is applicable to all types of Investment strategies and hedge funds! The performance of a few of the stocks in your portfolio will finally end up heavily influencing the returns of your overall portfolio. → Think of Tesla incase of ARK and FAANG in case of S&P 500.\n\n**\\[9\\]** There is some [existing research](https://scholarship.tricolib.brynmawr.edu/handle/10066/588) that deep dives into this topic.\n\n**\\[10\\]** Since it’s a live tracker using data from Alpha Vantage, the calculation is done slightly differently than in the analysis (in the live tracker I had to use the closing price on the day of recommendation instead of the opening price of the next day). I will be updating it to follow the same process as the analysis as soon as I get info from Alpha Vantage.", "id": "rwmxel", "created_utc": 1641389352.0, "score": 974, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 160, "comments": [{"body": "Cramer told me to buy NVDA at $33", "score": 146, "replies": [{"body": "Similar for me.

Yeah, but that's not what drives consumers.\n\nI agree that cars have one job- transportation. \n\nI also agree that there is more inherent transformational potential in a smart phone than a car. \n\nHowever, the story of the last 200 years of industrialization has been fossil fuels/energy and mass movement of people. It also presents our greatest challenge at present. \n\nWhile solar panels, electric cars, and related technology has existed for some time (just like cell phones were made before Apple did the iPhone) the ability to make it practical, cost effective, and go beyond cars is special. Also, there has always been this sense that people go electric out of a sense of sacrifice or virtue signaling....the cars work, but barely, and with significant sacrifice in terms of style, range, comforts, performance. TSLA has flipped that on its head. Not only are their cars electric, but they're luxurious, stylish, and perform way better than their gas competitors. That's a total paradigm shift from what the Prius represented 15 years ago. \n\nTSLA's mission is to \"accelerate the advent of sustainable transport\". If they're successful, they'll be a fabulous company and a hell of an investment. The world's population is only getting larger.

It's not just about the product- the car itself. They're selling direct to consumers w/o dealerships. They're ramping up their ability to make house calls for service. They're trying to create a supercharger network. They're putting lots of work into creating fleet vehicles.\n\nThey're also selling parts to other auto manufacturers. Add to that the battery technology, Space X, etc. and you have a lot of potential value.\n\nThe fundamental question has always been whether or not people will adopt EV technology. That question has been answered by TSLA- yes, people will do it, and in many cases pay over $100K for the privilege. They have brand loyalty and equity that they'll be able to mine for quite some time (a la Apple).\n\nYMMV. I'm no oracle and I see the counterarguments but most of the best performing stocks of the last 30 years could have had competent critiques written about them at various points along the way.

It is a mistake to consider them static rules over time because things change. \n\nWhen I got my bachelors at UNSW it was hilarious noting the disparity between market theory in textbooks and actual reality; governments are never going to allow asset classes to collapse over the long term. Steve Keen’s very public bet over housing prices is still something I find to be a sign of the disparity between theory and practice.\n\nThere are many ways investors can realize value. Some people want constant cash returns such as dividends or rental income. Some people are happy to sit on capital appreciation and don’t care about liquid returns. Some what both.\n\nFor me, similar to Sydney real estate, an adjustment needs to be made for asset quality and what impact this has overtime. What I mean by this is, there are only so many homes in Bondi, Double Bay, Mosman, etc. These are prime locations that will always have more and more demand as people have more and more money. Is a two bedroom apartment worth $5m when it was only $1m not that long ago? How do we answer that question? Do I think Sydney prices are going to revert to prior levels despite being at obscene levels? No, simply because there’s an ever increasing number of people with ever increasing amounts of money chasing finite assets. In my opinion, it’s a similar situation to listed investment opportunities. There are only so many truly quality stocks available for money to buy into. We’re talking about trillions of dollars from all over the world looking to buy into the best possible assets. We’ve never seen such a flow of liquidity before, and our monetary system ensures that it will only expand further, such is the nature of percentage-based growth.\n\nParts of Buffet’s approach to evaluating opportunities is something that appeals to me; do I understand the business and do I like the management team? For Tesla, for me, the answer to both questions is yes. In terms of the numbers, in the environment we’re in now and the direction we’re headed in, I personally think Tesla is fairly valued. I’m ok that Tesla doesn’t return capital. It can deploy capital far better than I can. I agree completely that the numbers seem obscene but that depends also on the predictions of its future performance. Would I pay $1t today for a company that has the potential to do what Tesla will be doing in 5 or 10 years? Absolutely! That’s my personal position. Ultimately, that’s the game we’re all playing; what am I willing to pay today to have access to future returns. That’s how I think of things!", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "If you want to do valuation of massive growth companies just use PEG ratio because P/E is deceptive, and even with that telsa is extremely overvalued at around ~6.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Funny how OP ignored this comment because it wrecks his incorrect opinion about Tesla’s valuation.", "score": 0, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I think the hype Tesla monkeys will down vote you, screaming something about papa Musk and other gibberish.", "score": -7, "replies": []}, {"body": "https://www.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/rw0qru/comparing_to_amazon_when_they_joined_the_1/", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Wtf tesla isn't a tech company, it's a battery company.", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "Ultra long on tesla, it will be more worth than apple! 😂😅🤣", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "BYD does the same thing as VW, they fudge their numbers with hybrids to make people like you think they are doing something", "score": 4, "replies": []}, {"body": "I don’t have knowledge nor data to back it up, but feel like the recent run up of TSLA is mainly driven by call option buyers just hoping it will keep going up.

{"title": "The perfect time for long term investors to buy their favourite growth stocks?", "selftext": "  \nSince Feb 2021, at that first sniff of inflation and the prospect of interest rate rises, growth stocks have seen a continual and quite brutal decline with many well over 50% down from their ATH's and some even as far as 80%.   \n\n\nIf you go back in time to a year ago today, these boards were full of bull cases for these rapidly accelerating stocks. Companies with revenue growth of 40%+ YoY, terrific balance sheets, good business models in growing markets still in the infancy of their business life cycles . All the type of things a person wishing to buy stocks and hold for the long term absolutely love to see. Fast forward to today and you can hardly give these types of stock away. Sentiment could not be lower. Which is exactly the reason I have decided to take the funds out of my ISA (which was essentially losing me money anyway) and put the whole thing into growth stocks that I really love.   \n\n\nStocks like Pinterest for instance; its trading at a valuation that it was in 2019, at a time when its revenues are half of what it is now, its began to prove it can turn a profit, massive companies like Microsoft and PAYPAL are sniffing around wanting to buy it. Yet here it is, 60% down from its highs, trading at 2019 levels, and its making more money than ever, with no sign of that slowing down as it continues to generate more revenue per customer every quarter.   \n\n\nThe market it currently full of stocks like this. The likes of Square, Palantir, Crowdstrike, Draftkings, cloudfare, SoFi; all the stocks that got people so excited 12 months ago. They are all making more money now (quite a lot more) than they were this time last year but are trading at half the valuations. This is exactly the scenario people should want. All those reasons for optimism last year are still valid, arguably more so.   \n\n\nFor me, ive decided to sell some of my safer investments and open big positions in some of these stocks now with the intention of holding them for a long time. If they market continues to drop, thats fine, I will buy more. Because at these valuations, I feel a heck of a lot more comfortable.", "id": "rwxyd5", "created_utc": 1641420119.0, "score": 357, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 213, "comments": [{"body": "Sounds like you have a plan.  Let me offer 3 warnings.\n\n1. These stocks HAVE gone way down and do have more earnings or else on their way to more earnings.  But that doesn't mean they are priced well now.  Remember: when they were flying high with little or no earnings they were considered really overpriced.  Being lower than those prices does not necessarily make them a good value now.\n2. There are changes in the investing environment.  When these stocks were flying high, interest rates were low and expected to stay low for a while.  Now they are expected to rise.  That in and of itself should be expect to compress multiples (meaning someone willing to pay 50x earnings at the lower rates may now be only willing to pay 25x earnings at the higher rates).  So even if the prices are much lower, they may not be as big as a bargain as it looks from just looking at price change alone.\n3. It seems contradictory, but research shows that high-priced growth stocks often come *down* in price as they start to make money.  How can this be?  It's because the uncertainty in future earnings leads investors to be overoptimistic about potential earnings, and so they price in very high amounts.  So for example Company X is growing but still with no earnings yet looks like it could make anywhere from 10B to 100B/yr.  Excited investors pump the price up closer to the 100B earnings range.  As the actual earnings start getting made it turns out it looks like they will end up closer to the 25B/yr range.  So earnings are going way up...and the stock price will come way down.\n\nSo just be careful out there and don't just assume that more earnings and lower price automatically makes them a good buy.", "score": 202, "replies": [{"body": "Can you link the research?", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "I first heard about this in Ben Felix's video about \"Investing in Technological Revolutions\" (I'm sure he was talking about ARKK because it was so hot at the time).\n\nHowever, the phenomenon is not just limited to \"technological revolutions\".

In fact some names like PLAN & YEXT are actually trading at sales multiples similar to what they were trading at during the bottom of the 2020 crash. This is in comparison to huge increases in both sales and earning multiples for names like AAPL, NVDA, GOOG, etc... Take AAPL as an example... AAPL was trading at a P/S of ~5.5 before the pandemic now it's at 8.1. I completely understand everyone is panicking right now and wants something with positive cash flows and a good balance sheet to fall back on, but I'm not sure it makes much sense for the difference between large cap and small cap growth to be this extreme.\n\nI could come up with explanations for this such as the fact many of these tech growth names will probably see slower growth this year as the pandemic pulled a lot of tech growth forward. But if this is the concern, why is AAPL which benefited significantly from the stay-at-home economy not seeing similar worries? Or why is SHOP which has positive cash flows and more growth than AAPL trading at 35x sales when it was trading at 38x before the pandemic?\n\nAn argument could also be made that many of these young unprofitable companies need debt to finance their growth and raising rates will impact their business model more than a profitable company, but unless I'm being very naive here I very much doubt rates will go high enough any time soon for this to be a major concern.\n\nFurther I think we could be nearing peak FED panic at this point. The FED is worried about inflation but it looks very likely inflation may be peaking. I'm not an expert on macro economics so someone please correct me if I'm wrong here, but I think there is a chance the FED simply wants to send the market a signal that it's serious about getting inflation under control to avoid the risk of markets and the economy running too hot. I wonder if we're likely to see them take a much more dovish tone later this year should inflation begin to fall or the economy shows signs of weakness, perhaps even recession.\n\nI guess to answer your question though, yeah, this is a great time to buy growth stocks.

In fact, all my other large caps I've been selling.\n\nReally my only concern with both AMZN and SHOP is that they were such pure pandemic plays.

Waymo also has deployed driverless Robotaxis, before Cruise. Industry generally recognizes that Waymo is ahead. Look no further than the fact that Cruise has less than 20 vehicles in testing in California while Waymo has over 100, and more in other states.\n\nWith that being said, Boris acknowledges that both the Tesla wide scale vision only approach and Waymo's concentrated approach *will lead to autonomy*. The question is when. This is why Elon calls Lidar a crutch. Waymo and others believe that this high fidelity mapping and multi sensor approach is necessary to bring Robotaxis to market near term, but fully realize that it is unnecessary long term.\n\nHowever, an important point comes up in the interview. Boris Sofman acknowledges that Waymo had to essentially scrap everything and rebuild *after they had already \"succeeded\" in driverless vehicles in Chandler, Arizona*. He says that this was necessary to build a system that could work in a more challenging environment, say, a denser city. \n\nThis essentially means that Chandler, Arizona driving is basically hard coded. It will not scale and cannot be deployed to other cities. Building a software that \"works\" in the small region and cannot go on the freeway does not get them any closer to building a software that \"works\" elsewhere. This is very problematic. They have to re-solve the self driving problem is every single city they want to be in and hope it doesn't change too much over time.\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla's approach is extremely scalable, but obviously absurdly more difficult. Once Tesla's solution works, it works. And this is even more profound as there are more than 2 million Tesla's already out there that can simply download this software. Even if Waymo completed FSD today, they would have to buy up $100,000 vehicles, whereas Tesla could simply offer owners a cut and immediately deploy millions of vehicles.\n\nNow the question is obviously when Tesla will succeed.

Chicken Genius Singapore has a good video offering his strategy for selling ATM puts to generate income.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5dv7ojDMy4&list=WL&index=4\n\nWhat areaolaisland said about margin is also important. If you don't have enough margin to sell TSLA puts, you can sell puts for a cheaper stock that you also have confidence in. NVDA, for example, locks up only $29,000 of margin, vs. TSLA's $115,000.\n\nNote that margin is not \"used\" but ony locked up. You do not have to pay interest on the margin that is locked up.

This is regardless of whatever the stock price may fluctuate to.\n\nIf you wish to close the position, you will have to buy it back, which is where gain/loss for closing the position will be calculated.\n\nAlso, for tax purposes, if this is happening in a taxable account, then no matter how long you've held the position, it's taxed as a short term capital gain and will be at ordinary rates.\n\nEdit:  Also, keep in mind that if you sell a $1400 put, you will need some cash or margin requirements to cover the position.

If Tesla is over 1400 at expiration, then the option you sold is worthless and you win that bet.\n\nIf the Tesla is under 1400, then you'd have to buy 100 shares (per contract) of TSLA costing you 1400/share.  So, if Tesla was 400, you'd lose $100K.  (Net loss of $52,630)\n\nFor you to start to lose money on the trade, TSLA would have to be under 926.3.\n\nIs this European option rules or American?

Buy vehicle used, clear your credit card, LOC, or personal loan debts … or at least reduce them to the point that if shit does hit the fan, paying it off won’t take decades.\n\n- Don’t let this defeat you, you will recover with time.\n\n- load up a small amount of money into your brokerage account and trade in small amounts to teach yourself how to really trade.\n\n- We all lose some $$$ at some point in the market.\n\n- Focus on the important things in life, like spending time with your kids and wife. Make sure to muck your wife’s barn on the daily for this fuck up.\n\n- Open an RRSP and RESP and start contributing to it. Doesn’t need to be a lot just be consistent as much as possible … if you haven’t already.\n\n- Do not let trust fund babies who get lucky on trades get to you.\n\n- Control your gambling tendencies and work on self-control, deep thinking and providing yourself a “mental” break in times of stress or anxiety or uncertainty to get your mind straight.\n\n- As much as possible do not let emotions drive your investments and trades.\n\n- last but not least, do not, I repeat do not, let this affect your health. There’s millions if not billions of people who have it way worse wishing they were in your shoes. \n\nYou got this brother, don’t feel shame, don’t feel defeated, just take it as an L.\n\nTake this time to restructure yourself and spend more time on the family, focus on that for now.
