{"title": "I don't think people understand what's going on with the Fed / central banks.", "selftext": "I often read posts / comments from people who talk about the stock market as if it were an isolated entity.  \"It has some good years, it has some bad years, lately we've had good years, there will be bad years, too, but it always goes up over time.\"  All of this is true.  But I don't think you can look at the last 13 years or so and say that what we've seen is just business as usual.  It's not.  What we've seen the last 13 years has been entirely unprecedented and has basically been an experiment in monetary policy.\n\nI could make this a long post, but I'll try to make it as simple as possible.  Take a look at the M1 money stock, which over the last 13 years, since the Global Financial Crisis, has increased significantly, and radically so since the Covid-19 pandemic.  (Note that M1 money means \"the most liquid portions of the money supply, containing currency and assets that either are or can be quickly converted to cash)\n\n[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1SL](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1SL)\n\nAlso interesting to compare the S+P 500 to the M1 money supply: [1. post-2008](https://inukshukcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/SP-500-vs-M1-Money-Stock-scaled.jpg),\n\n[2. since Covid-19](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/c08c52_b6b1a1d762ed46ef8503dc75f7fdfd22~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_744,h_475,al_c,q_90/c08c52_b6b1a1d762ed46ef8503dc75f7fdfd22~mv2.jpg)\n\nFinally, someone linked an article a few weeks back from an analyst who said we shouldn't be afraid of high rates, but rather low rates, because markets have always been at their worst when rates were low.  This is obviously ridiculous, because that's like saying that we shouldn't be afraid of smoking, but rather chemotherapy, because incidences of cancer are always higher when people are on chemotherapy rather than when they are smoking.  Well of course!  Chemotherapy is the remedy to cancer.  Just as low rates are the remedy to a market downturn.  We would expect that low rates would correlate to market downturns, given that they are the tool we use to stimulate the economy when things aren't going well.\n\nEven so, the author of that article was using the period of 2009 to make his case (worst bear market in history also corresponded to the lowest rates).  But you don't have to be a genius to see the correlation between low rates and stock prices, especially in the last decade:\n\n[https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pice484f31450a7fa148b4f1e431e64e1aa.png](https://d1-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pice484f31450a7fa148b4f1e431e64e1aa.png)\n\nOf course, there's also empirical evidence that this is the case: [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract\\_id=2941281](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2941281)\n\nIn summary, I don't think you can talk about the stock market in isolation without considering the monetary policy that's fueling it, especially now given that monetary policy has been so dramatic and unprecedented.  Doing so would be like saying \"well bread is usually about $2.50 a loaf, that's gone up over the years but it tends to remain steady in the short to mid term\".  Of course, that's true in the USA.  But in Venezuela such a statement wouldn't hold true.  Not that the US is anywhere near Venezuela, and I'm not calling for hyperinflation or anything like that.  But you have to remember that we're dealing with money here.  Money is not something that holds value on its own, it depends on many other factors, not least of which is monetary policy.  No reasonable discussion of prices, whether of goods and services or assets, is complete without taking into account monetary policy, especially given the nature of what's been going on the last decade.\n\nEDIT: M1 money stock jumped so significantly in May 2020 because of an accounting rule change.  [Please see here](https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/the-fed-isnt-printing-as-much-money-as-you-think/).  Still, the charts I have presented that compare M1 to the S&P 500 do not take into account that change, thus the correlation stands.  [See here.](https://www.ftschuyler.com/single-post/m1-money-supply-vs-s-p-500-index)\n\nEDIT 2: The chart I used could be a bit misleading.

People make decisions based on those values everyday, so they do serve an important function in an economy. If interests rates are low, more people are going to be willing to embark on bigger projects. I can see this in my own life, home loan interest rates were really low this last year, so I bought a house. I would not have done that if interest rates were, say 8% for example. Similar with prices, there is a certain threshold where I no long am willing to purchase something based on the price. Distorting these interest rates and prices can have devastating effect.I'm definitely not saying that life would be perfect given that central banks cease to exist. Obviously fluctuations will still occur, the point is, that a market is much more stabile and better off without a couple people pulling levers somewhat arbitrarily. The idea that a couple people (who are fallible) get to decide the worth of my money is pretty scary.\n\nTo be honest with you, I'm a bit over my head with this discussion.  I don't know enough about it to have an honest take, but I do stand by the notion that market signals are not always perfect.  Far better than a managed economy, certainly, but then again we wouldn't have had a lot of the innovation we've had the past century without government intervention (think the internet, etc.).  Economist Mariana Mazzucato talks wonderfully about that here in this Ted talk if you feel like skimming or whatever:\n\n[https://www.ted.com/talks/mariana\\_mazzucato\\_government\\_investor\\_risk\\_taker\\_innovator?language=en](https://www.ted.com/talks/mariana_mazzucato_government_investor_risk_taker_innovator?language=en)\n\nMarket signals have also failed us in big ways in the past. Look at what the market was signaling pre-2008.  Of course, that's iffy, because you could argue that the whole thing was out of whack precisely because of central bank meddling.  Still, it was definitely a laissez-faire approach that ruled the day during the Greenspan era. \n\n>I 100% agree that downturns are not fun. If ABCT is correct, then central banks are making the lives of normal working people, enormously worse buy devaluating their currency & making busts WORSE than otherwise.Again, the idea is that during the loose money boom, resources are allocated to the wrong things or allocated inefficiently. Business that should fail because they are not efficient, are allowed to continue considerably longer (using up resources that would be better served elsewhere). The bust is the healthy correction where those inefficient resources are allocated back to their most efficient use.\n\nYes, I agree with the notion that busts are important correcting mechanisms.  That said, I do tend to believe that letting things sit idle without any intervention is a mistake.  I draw mostly on the work of [William White](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_White_(economist)) to inform my inexpert opinion on all this.  He predicted the 2008 crisis and is something of a mix between Keynes and Schumpert.  I am unsure if central banks are the principle cause of busts, but I do get the feeling that the past 20 years of serial bubbles have been brought on by excessive central bank intervention.\n\n>I personally don't believe this is a true statement. I believe that a decentralized system is far superior to centralizing the control of money to a small committee of fallible people (I'm reminded of economists saying everything is totally fine even up to the eve of the housing crisis). I think we agree though that the current state of central banks is not ideal though at the least.\n\nOh yes, what a disaster.  I have very little faith in central bankers, and I had been saying that they were going to be wrong about \"transitory inflation\" for months now.  Because they were wrong about subprime being contained, too.  They let Lehman fail because they thought they had everything under control.  They are fallible people trying to play God and really it's just a recipe for disaster.  There's a great book by Richard Werner, the father of the term quantitative easing, called *The Princes of the Yen* which dives into the issue of central bank independence.\n\nI don't know what the long-term solution is, but what I do know is that what we have right now isn't working.

We reap the benefits now, but at some point we'll have to pay for it.\n\nAs for the Fed saving the economy, some have argued that the Fed's low interest policies are the very cause of serial bubbles in the first place.  There's an argument that low interest rates thanks to the Asian crisis in the late 90s led to the dot-com bubble, after which rates were lowered again which then led to the real estate bubble.  After that there was market weakness in 2019 even before Covid when the Fed had to reverse their balance sheet reduction.\n\nAlso, the notion that we've gotten off scot free is incorrect.

Instead, people should be focusing on government outlays.  The economy cannot grow unless Congress spends more money into it, we run a trade deficit, taxes are reduced, or credit expands.  In other words, goods and/or money need to increase to grow the economy.\n\nWhen the government runs a deficit, they are spending more than they are taking out in taxes.  When they run a surplus, as Clinton did, they take in more in taxes than they are spending into the economy.  The \"debt\" is the running total of all T-bonds in existence.\n\nAs the total govt outlays increase, either the govt is supporting the economy by buying goods and services or they are paying money directly to people who then use it to buy goods and services.  This would be building roads in the former case or paying disability to a veteran in the latter case.  It is through this action that the economy grows.  If the government were to run neither a surplus, nor a deficit, the economy would not grow, because the same amount of money would be churning around buying the same amount of stuff.  In reality, though, it would shrink the economy, because money always spends up.  Over time, the money taken in by business accumulates in the coffers of the business and its shareholders that spend less than they earn.\n\nThe fed, on the other hand, has very little to do with any of that.  When Congress appropriates spending, the fed marks up the various accounts in the federal government and from there, those departments spend it.  The Fed's actions are limited to strictly monetary policy.  Rate setting, selling bonds, reserve requirements, easing or tightening.  None of these, besides rate setting, have that much of an effect.\n\nT-bonds are just an instrument that the govt uses to give the holders of excess cash a guaranteed place to put it that earns interest.  It isn't \"borrowing\".  They don't need to borrow money.  The net effect of that interest is to increase the total amount of cash in existence.  When the bond expires, the holder is returned the amount they paid for it plus the interest accumulated over it's term.  X + (any positive rate) is greater than X, obviously.\n\nSince the economy can only grow if the amount of money in the system increases, bonds help to grow the economy by adding money.  Quantitative easing, or the fed buying up bonds, just swaps interest bearing bonds with non-interest bearing cash.  It will ultimately slow growth, not increase it.  It does temporarily add liquidity, but that liquidity can be gained through the appropriate actions via Congress.\n\nTightening is just the opposite of that.  The fed unloading its bonds will ultimately increase the money supply, but in the short term will have a negative effect on liquidity.\n\nHowever, when the fed raises rates, they are engaging in a kind of price setting.  The price of credit is reflected in the cost of all goods and services.  If it costs Verizon more to borrow money and build cell towers, they will pass that cost on to their customers.  This is inherently inflationary.  The fed rasing rates and the problems associated with that can be seen in the 1980s inflation experienced under Volcker, Turkey or Argentina today.  \n\nIf the anyone really cared about inflation, they would do something to ease the burden of the supply chain.  There wouldn't be ships sitting out at sea waiting to dock for weeks.  Congress would engage the military to add bodies to solve this problem.  Instead, they let everyone get away with murder, raising prices and allowing greed to run rampant.  \n\nTo go back to the OP though, the treasury releases a report daily that shows how much they spent and how much they taxed.  The monthly total is what you should be watching.  Don't be a zombie that watches the fed for information about the future of the economy.  If the fed gives you anything, it's a contrary move to go against the fed zombies.  It's not that the fed has NO power in the matter, it's that the real driver is the spending appropriated by Congress and spent out by the treasury.  It is that money that ultimately increases GDP.  Once you understand that, you might start to wonder if that money is really going to the right places.  The lower on the economic totem pole you put that money, the more people and businesses it will affect before finally ending up in the bank account of one of the Waltons where it will sit until the end of the USA.

This is based on assuming a 7.5% CAGR for the S&P 500 (including all dividends) vs. a 3.5% CAGR in oil stock prices and a 5% dividend reinvested into the S&P 500.\n\nEdit - What this means is that if I invested $1,000 into the S&P 500 and $1,000 in oil, my forecast is that at the end of 5 years, the S&P 500 investment would be worth about $1,436 and the oil investment would be worth $1,460--so, accounting for inflation, about enough to treat your wife and her boyfriend to Burger King)\n\nThis may not sound like much, but most people don't beat the market most years--in fact, most people do substantially worse.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Demand-Side Concerns----------------------------------------------**\n\nI first want to call out that the long-term trend for oil has been an increase in daily consumption around the globe and it is forecasted to recover from the 2020-2022 lulls in consumption over the next few years as the pandemic subsides (hopefully).  Oil demand is not in some massive decline ([Global oil demand 2006-2026 | Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/271823/daily-global-crude-oil-demand-since-2006/)).\n\nAdditionally, I think that the big \"nail-in-the-coffin\" for oil is supposed to be the Electric Vehicle (EV).  This may be true since about 70% of oil is used for transportation, but I think that people are about a generation off.\n\n* The EIA doesn't project peak for traditional combustion engines until nearly 2040 ([Electric vehicles projected to make up 31% of the global fleet by 2050 (electrek.co](https://electrek.co/2021/10/26/electric-vehicles-projected-to-make-up-31-of-the-global-fleet-by-2050/)).\n* Even sources that are pushing for EV adoption estimate that by 2030, EV sales will only make up 30% of total new car sales ([EV Sales Forecasts – EVAdoption](https://evadoption.com/ev-sales/ev-sales-forecasts/))\n\nFor my time horizon (1-5 years), I do not see the demand for oil collapsing, rather, I see it growing at a modest pace.  Given how short-term markets really are, I don't see a substantive threat in the next five years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Supply-side concerns-------------------------------------------------**\n\nI'm sure that we all remember in 2020 when the Pandemic hit, short-term oil futures were negative because there was nowhere to store it.  This led to something interesting:  100 oil companies when bankrupt ([Over 100 oil and gas companies went bankrupt in 2020 (houstonchronicle.com](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/energy/article/More-than-100-oil-and-gas-companies-filed-for-15884538.php)) and the number of active rigs collapse ([U.S. oil & gas rigs in use per month 2021 | Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1109332/us-oil-and-gas-rigs-in-use-covid19/))\n\nThis number is increasing as time goes on, but it is down.  The thing to remember is that these things don't just come on-line in a few weeks.  The drilling may only take 3-4 weeks, but the entire process can take months or years depending on where in the process you start.  This is a rather capital-intensive process, and I don't think we'll see levels approaching prior levels any time soon.\n\nThe other big concern on the supply-side is OPEC (really, we're talking about the Saudis).  They want the price of oil to be high enough that it supports their country's budgets, but low enough that they maintain share (keep US drillers from being active--this puts additional pressure on US drillers operating domestically).  They can move supply up-and-down to a degree to match demand and any big threats to demand will likely be met with cuts that will maintain prices.\n\nNote that this is simply me talking out my ass, but my guess is that the Saudis want to drive oil to the $100/barrel mark while they know US producers are still spinning up and then drive it back down to put them out of business.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Inflation--------------------------------------------------------------------**\n\nI think oil companies will respond well to inflationary pressures.  If inflation spools up, the price will go up, and oil companies will profit.  They have an elasticity curve that lets them pass on their costs fully because there is no real substitute for their products.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Multiple Expansion vs. Contraction----------------------------**\n\nThe S&P 500 currently sits at about 30 whereas the XLE is at 17 ([Group Screener - Valuation sector pe (finviz.com)](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx?g=sector&v=120&o=pe)).  Not sure if this is right, but most of my oil stocks have low valuations.  Simply put, I don't think there's too much more room for these to go down in a sane market, nor do I suspect that the S&P 500 has a whole lot more to expand.  So, I'm expecting there to be some multiple expansion over the next few years as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn summary, I think traditional energy is a great investment over the next few years and that the idea that you're guaranteed a capital loss is...silly.", "id": "rztcim", "created_utc": 1641740101.0, "score": 233, "upvote_ratio": 0.71, "num_comments": 279, "comments": [{"body": "Bought up a lot of Canadian oil companies when it tanked in 2020 - obviously an extreme overreaction at that point.

It costs significant money to outsource the battery materials, like zinc and cobalt, or the fully manufactured battery itself. Therefore, a company that relies on outsourcing has to raise its prices to maintain a certain level of margin.\n\nAs classic economics shows, consumers won’t pay more money for a product if they can get something of equal or better value for cheaper. So companies like Tesla that can produce cheaper EV cars, while still remaining profitable, will ultimately gain more market share. Also, since Tesla is profitable, it has the ability to grow its business/innovate, such as by building new giga factories, advancing its electrical engineering capabilities, expanding its charging station network, and developing new energy sectors like HVAC. \n\nAlso, when the initial automotive industry really began to explode in the early 1900’s, there were a vast amount of companies entering the space too. However, only a handful of companies, commonly referred to as, the “Big Three,” Ford, General Motors, and Chrysler were able to mass produce vehicles and command the majority market share. Therefore, the capabilities, efficiencies, and profitability of these three companies forced many others out of the automotive space. \n\nAs much of history repeats itself, it is reasonable to predict a similar outcome in the EV space. Only a handful of proven companies like Tesla, Rivian, NIO, Ford, Volkswagen, and a few others will have the ability to profitably survive in such a competitive and expensive space. \n\nNo one can be certain for sure, only time will tell, but my bet is that Tesla will only continue to go up 🚀🚀", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I mean if he calls everything a bubble always he’s bound to be right eventually.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "The Sony news is a year old….also think about it you can buy so many different companies’ cell phones some you’ve never heard of there are over 100 brands of cell phones but here WE ALL ARE on an iPhone…", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Pretty simple really, Sony makes electronic devices.

Also if you are a day trader, good luck to you as well !! - I recently read a post from fellow investor who turned over $28 million in a year and was in negative $7600 :) I personally think it's not worth the time and emotional well being.\n\nWhat I have learned during my 5 years investing journey is that stocks mostly move up and down driven by sentiment; it comes down to demand and supply - if people are willing to sell for less OR if there are less buyers than sellers, price moves down. These are mostly driven by \\`catalysts\\` - a positive/negative earnings, black/white swan events, macro events or even a PR ! But these moves do not usually last long so unless you are trying to time the market, its very difficult to win most of the time.\n\nI would mostly like to focus on two things on this DD - why WISH is down? and if it can recover.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Why WISH is down so much?**\n\n**Sector rotation:**\n\n* The short answer is sector rotation - BIG money going elsewhere. It's just not WISH, the whole growth small cap sector is down big time. And there are some add-ons to it - SPAC/new IPOs are further down, e-commerce sector is further down, growth are hammered, companies having China ties are further down. Just look at  one year chart of these companies for example - STNE (Warren buffet is an investor), BABA (Charlie Munger), CLOV/OPEN (Chamath); TDOC, CRSP (Cathie Wood) even PayPal and SQ are down big time. Remember February last year? It doesn't take much time to move them back up if BIG money flows back in :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Macro events:**\n\n* Chinese govt crackdown on tech companies- BABA, DIDI,BAIDU and whole Chinese tech. This negatively effected WISH as well.\n* Reopening of economy drove consumers to stores and it made the 2nd quarter look bad. All e-commerce revenue is down including ETSY and AMZN not just WISH.\n* Apple changed privacy policy and it had huge impact on Ad spending (it impacted many growth companies who relied on Ad spending to procure customers) - price went up 2-3 times.\n* Supply chain issues - specifically goods coming out of China.\n* Inflation and rising interest fear in the market though it shouldn't effect WISH as it has no debt.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Other WISH specific catalysts:**\n\n* CFO's departure\n* BIG investors exit\n* Slow down (pause) of growth and MAUs down\n* CEO's leaving\n* Down trend causing price to go further down - sentiment, margin call, tax harvesting and few others.\n* Meme tag\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**And finally some noise:**\n\n* Negative short articles all over (by shorts)\n* Lawsuits (mostly fake)\n* High short selling (by short term traders)\n* Insiders selling (no real selling - almost all of them are for tax purpose to cover RSU)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Now, can WISH recover?**\n\nAbsolutely ! Go look at NIO, ETSY, TSLA, AMD and even AMZN - you can find many. It may take some time since there are ton of attractive companies to invest in right now - let's just take BABA for example; I believe it should be trading at 3x today. But I am staying put at WISH because I believe BABA can't 10x and WISH has that potential. Here's why:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Has been built over a period of decade and over $2 billion has been invested in the business (including advertisings) before IPO money. Go look at CrunchBase - there were many rounds of investing and many investors invested over $5b valuation level before 2015. As everybody knows WISH was offered by AMZN and BABA $10 billion in 2015.\n* 500 million plus downloads in Google play store with about 14 millions over 4 star reviews! Over 2.4 million positive reviews on Apple Store, top 5 e-commerce global platform in many countries - Can you believe it? $1 billion enterprise value with $1.2 billion hard cash? Compare that to Aliexpress and other e-commerce platform.\n* Came from IPO and not SPAC route. When companies go for IPO, due diligence/valuation is little strict compared to SPAC deals as the Banks have to underwrite. It was valued at $24 a share. At the time JPMC and few others have $30 PT for 2021. Business has actually improved a lot since then if we forget growth for a min which is proportionate to Ad spending.\n* Is a global e-commerce platform and not US only like ETSY, Wayfair, Overstock etc.. It's not cheap to build a global e-commerce platform so there is a significant barrier of entry.\n* Has its own business segment that no US/Western company has - serving low to middle class value seeking customer base. Since it is global, it has huge potential to penetrate into India, Brazil and African markets as well. Look at Flipcart (India), MercadoLibre (brazil), Jumia (africa) - WISH do not need to win anywhere, just a small slice of cake is more than enough to increase revenue significantly!\n* Has now built its own logistics business - $1 billion revenue is not a joke! Imagine small merchants being able to ship worldwide effortlessly! Most of the third world countries have copyright issues/fake product issues - they are willing to spend higher if they can buy authentic Nike shoes for example.\n* Has $1.2 billion in cash and no debt. Over the period of last 6 months I have investigated many companies and I haven't seen any companies in WISH's size to have that much money with no debt  AND this level of Revenue ! Inflation and rising interest rates are no problem for WISH. I've read people's concerned about cash burn, but that's going to be stabilized starting this quarter. $1 billion is a lot of money to spend for growth! It can even buy small companies to diversify its business, invest in new technology and even buy it's own share (its highly unlikely for growth companies though). WISH actually has already been working on WISH clips, live shopping and new influencer led businesses. I believe 1Sansome has potential to be a billion dollar business in no time ! Go look at SHEIN -I encourage people to compare SHEIN and 1Sansome website. SHEIN is now a $10 billion dollar business. \n* Social commerce that WISH is heading into is already more than a $1T business. - [https://ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/social-commerce-the-next-wave-in-online-shopping/](https://ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/social-commerce-the-next-wave-in-online-shopping/)\n* Is promptly acting to align/fix it's business - revamping it's website, introducing video clips/live shopping, fixing merchant/product quality issues, improving shipping time and potentially getting into new business segments - fintech, payment processing, trend shopping etc.\n* Got the best management in place now. Forget Peter - he was an engineer and not a business person. Google was actually run by Eric Schdmit and was brought in by the founders Surgery and Larry. I recognize the charm about founder led companies but he still does own about 20% of the business so he is vested. In fact, he is the one who brought Jackie in. Peter has become millionaire from billionaire so he has the most vested interest in WISH than any of us! and I encourage people to go read Jackie's employment terms - her major compensation starts when the WISH stock reaches $30! Also most of the higher management is paid in RSU so its in their interest to make the company successful and remain with WISH.\n* Has the most cost efficient business model - It doesn't need investment in physical warehouse -WISH Local is now just paused but it has huge potential. It's employee efficiency is highest in the industry - just about 1,000 people running the company VS SHEIN with 10,000 employees !\n* Rising Ad costs are effecting every e-commerce growth companies but WISH's Ad campaign is the most efficient of most of them. In fact Facebook offered $20 million for its Ad algorithm very early on. I've read many posts that WISH Ad campaign is one of the most efficient campaign in Facebook so it would fare better and can remain competitive. They got the best Data science team - look at their patents! It's a data science / AI company as well.\n* Even though WISH's revenue is decreased and MAU's have decreased, it's still very significant - go compare with ETSY. This quarter is important - if it can become close to EBTDA positive with less Ad spending and still manages to maintain 40M active users and about 1.5B revenue, it's already a lot ! I do not see any issues doubling the revenue if WISH can make those customers happy and increase their LTV - 40 millions of \\`active\\` customers are a lot of customers.\n* Major competitor is Aliexpress but go try buying something from there and try to return an item or settle an issue! You have to deal with the seller first. WISH no question asked - you even keep your item. Also WISH is growing its merchant base all the world - about 50% are now US based.\n* E-commerce segment is growing fast and would pass $8 trillion by 2025. With fast delivery and last mile delivery solved, traditional competitors like dollar general, five below and even Macy's JCPenny and most will be wiped out or wouldn't be able to compete. WISH should benefit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Common perceptions:**\n\n* Selling Chinese products => It's not even a point - more than 90% products sold all over the world are from China and it's for a reason - its most cheaper to manufacture products there. Most items Amazon sells are made in China. But the point is WISH is trying to create/promote Chinese brands - Assume a Chinese shoes brand that compares with Nike but half the cost.\n* Selling dildos => Sex toys are billions of dollar business. I don't see negatives there.\n* Selling cheap products -=>it's the main business ! Dollar General has $50 billion market cap alone and there are others - dollar tree, five below and even Japanese Daiso.\n* Selling fraudulent products => It's not WISH selling them, its the sellers. Could you not post anything on facebook marketplace? I am not saying it's not an issue and I think WISH is working hard to discourage/minimize those sellings.\n* Float too high for short squeeze => Look at Nokia; it went up 80% in one day last year - it has 10 times the float of WISH.\n* Cash burn => I would like to point out that companies are not usually upfront about investments. For example google categories them under \\`New bets\\`. So investment in 1Sansome for example might be hidden under SG&A ! We do not know what else is out there investment/initiative wise.\n* France ban => I take that as positive and it will be solved soon. WISH was already working on to fix quality/merchant issues - [https://merchant.wish.com/documentation/api/v3/reference#tag/EU-Product-Compliance](https://merchant.wish.com/documentation/api/v3/reference#tag/EU-Product-Compliance)\n* Going to zero => It may go down further but not going to zero. Only companies with debt are in immediate risk of going bankrupt. $1 billion is more than enough to create few startups.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Here are few upcoming catalysts:**\n\n* New CEO => Whoever is brought in, his fortune will be tied to WISH. Also whoever it is, it would be far better than Peter business wise.\n* Fourth Qtr earnings => Cash burn should stabilize and it should be close to EBTDA positive, if not a surprise profit !\n* Website revamp => Hopefully it will fix many issues including having to login ! I also think just a minor fix such as sorting a search results by price, reviews, sales and other metric should drive sales. Right now, I can't sort by specific products that are highest sellers in the category ! Its so dumb :)\n* Video shopping/Live Streaming => This is now big in China - look at Pinduoduo and others. Social commerce is the next BIG thing - a next gen QVC.\n* Potential buyout => I am personally not interested in buyout but its a possibility if it goes further down.\n* Wish standard, Wish access, revamped website, quality control, Wish clip and efficient use of marketing dollar should help return to growth.\n* Also very excited about 1Sansome - I believe its a underdog.\n* Investors who sold for a loss (tax harvesting) might be returning soon. For example I can't imagine why Jack Morris wouldn't buy back WISH at $3 unless he was not true about his WISH investment before.\n* I have a feeling we will see Institutional investment reaching back above 80% when the SEC filings come out this quarter. Vanguard now is the 2nd highest investor and its average is about $8.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Add-ons:**\n\n\\- If share price doesn't reach at least $17 by March 2023, Jackie gets 0. In order to fully vest her RSU price has to be at least $35. If the buyout occurs, stock price has to be at least $17 in order for her to make any money.

{"title": "Is it different this time? A wider perspective.", "selftext": "While most of us believe stock market is extremely overvalued with many mini bubbles popping up everywhere, I just wanted to look at this a bit differently by introducing a historical perspective in terms of the companies that make up today's markets, technology, the wealth creation and generation and most importantly the flow of money into goods and services.\n\nI wasn't old enough to grasp the dot-com crash back in early 2000's and while I do remember '08 crash pretty well, it took me many years to understand the underlying drivers of it. Over the years I tried to expand my knowledge of the markets and always tried to look at things from an historical perspective especially at those periods when markets were down/flat/didn't go anywhere for years or decades. With that perspective, what I want to try here is to use the benefit of hindsight, but not to state the obvious, but rather, state how things turned out in reality vs expectations at the time.\n\nListening to Warren Buffett's older speeches, one of the things he mentions often was that how American society thought they would be taken over by Japan in terms of technological advancement back in the late 70's and early 80's and that there was not enough optimism with respect to American innovation that could prevail its leadership going into the following decades. While obviously not the only factor, this lack of optimism was apparently evident in markets and there were many years when not much was happening.\n\nIt is actually fascinating to observe that over the coming years, the exact opposite has happened. Introduction of computer in the 60's in the west coast - perhaps much earlier than most of the world - the creation of Silicon Valley and emergence of big-tech are more than just happenstance. I am not an American. While i will not go too further deep into this topic here, my personal view is this all goes back to foundations of the country and the fact that there is no cultural baggage/deeply embedded subconscious that prevents things from happening on this side world. Perhaps the big reason for this is the change in behavior/consciousness of people who emigrated here and were able to drop the burdens of the past.\n\nIf you think about the wealth currently possessed in our world, most of it was perhaps created/generated in the last 50-100 years (perhaps even 20-30 years). You might have been born somewhere with rich history (as I was), your forefathers and the empires that they have built could have ruled the world for hundreds or thousands of years and conquered every corner of the world, but none of that matters now. It's as if millions of years of history is almost irrelevant at this point because you were either able to adapt things in the past few decades or you were not. What I am obviously talking about here is the new creation of wealth as the existing wealth matters less and less each day. One of the reasons for this is obviously the fact that the world has not seen a \"reset\" since World War 2. It is perhaps the first time in history when we had such prolonged peace.\n\nLet's think for a second the implications of globalization in this peace period. This is perhaps the first time in history where the world is so connected that even the products we use on a daily basis are the same. Imagine the flow of goods and services 50 years ago or even 25 years ago. Were you able to access goods and services overseas this easily? Where would your disposable income be spent on? Even 25 years ago local markets did matter for the most part. I'd watch local TV, buy local newspaper, only a handful people had cellphones, internet was still nascent, most of the appliances in your home were already a commodity. If you had disposable income, most of the money would be circulated within the local economy and the most expensive things would be the house you'd buy (that obviously does not change today) and a car which would benefit a few countries but not a single one (perhaps Germany for the most part). So all in all, there was no single country that the money was flowing into. This was not possible by design.\n\nI am not saying all this goes away now. But thinking for a second, isn't this really the first time that a significant portion of disposable income, wherever you are in the world, flows into one single country? And for economies in which this does not happen, do they really matter to the global wealth in grand scheme of things?\n\nTake Europe or Middle East for instance, amazing blend of many cultures, languages. The entire world once was ruled from Mesopotamia, then Ancient Egypt, Ancient Greece, Rome and so on. Are they relevant anymore? What does a beloved country of Italy contribute to world economy these days? France? Spain? UK? South East Asia? - amazing corners of the world, billions of lovely people. Do they matter from a wealth creation and flow of money perspective? Of course they do, but to what extent if you think about end products: goods and services. What do they actually produce that the entire world consumes/needs? Of course Middle East has oil. But oil is a raw material and the goods and services used by this wealth creation does not necessarily change - the cars they buy, the planes they fly, the services they use are not locally produced. Take Saudi Arabia, a total GDP about $800 billion with all the oil. Apple generated $366 billion revenues in the last twelve months.\n\nLet's expand upon this.\n\nLet's assume you wake up in the corner of the world and don't have survival problem. What you do or spend your time is not significantly different than us here in the US. Your homepage is google for everything, you use whatsapp to talk to your friends, you are on instagram, your business uses outlook/microsoft, your phone is samsung/apple/android, you log into youtube on a daily basis, you prefer to watch netflix over local TV. (Sure, China is different from this aspect but it is also the reason why they have been outpacing everywhere else in terms of economic growth. They were not stupid about this and realized the effects of globalization early on).\n\nNow, you might be thinking - dude that is only such a small portion of the world. Millions of people don't even have access to any of those. I am well aware of that and while it is correct for the most part, from an \"overall wealth creation perspective\", billions of people actually don't matter all. It may sound so harsh, but think about the many countries of the world with millions of population and realize that their total GDP is less than the cash sitting idle on Berkshire Hathaway balance sheet.\n\nOr think of this perspective: What would happen if their disposable income was magically 10x tomorrow? What goods and services would they spend their money on? Is it really the local goods and services that would benefit from the overall increase in GDP - of course to a great extent - or is it really a handful of companies in the world that would actually benefit disproportionately from this wealth increase when that happens? If everybody in India could afford iPhones would they buy something else instead? Or would they be able to produce a competing good or a service locally that the entire world would consume? Would the money really flow elsewhere?\n\nOr are they really late in the game anyway, as we already argued that in the wealth creation game only the most recent period matters.\n\nSince the dot-com bubble era, I'd argue that a lot of things have changed. It is interesting because dot-com bubble was the classic innovation pattern - people knew internet was the next big thing but it was not exactly clear who the winners in the next decades would be. 20 years since, we know who the winners are. We know what business models work, what business models can scale, have network effects and become profitable and so on. Horses vs cars was another classical example. You did not have to be a genius to realize cars would take over horses but time was harsh to many car companies in that there was no one single winner. It was by design of the product it became commoditized. Same can be argued for air travel. Internet however is different. While new business models emerge, consolidation and monopolistic effects are far more real - it's a world where big becomes bigger as it employs smartest people, outbids competition, and constantly innovates.\n\nOf course there is no guarantee this will go on like this. After all, if you look at top 10 companies in the S&P 500 for each of the past several decades, you will see interesting results. How will the next big thing overthrow the existing giants when big always get bigger, especially when they benefit from the overall wealth increase in every corner of the world? Perhaps a new technology or maybe a catastrophe can trigger this. While I'd never want to guess the future, I am inclined to think as long as the status-quo peace continues, certain companies in the world  - as they keep their innovative pace - will continue to dominate.\n\nIs the market expensive? It sure is. But what will happen tomorrow if GOOG, AAPL, AMZN drop by 20%? Wouldn't people rush to put their entire wealth the next day? Sure multiples can contract. But is a 25bps/50bps move in rates going to destroy these companies? Would it make them worth less? Yes discounted cash flows should be lower and they may be growing 15% instead of 20%. But 5 years from now, are we going to see something similar to dot-com bubble where things don't recover?\n\nBut where else can the money go when your disposable income will be spent on that next iPhone, or half your time is spent on instagram/whatsapp/youtube/google, your businesses will still use Microsoft and its products and that will probably not change anytime soon. These are important as indices are market-cap weighted indices. So we would need a correction in big-tech more than anything else. And even if they do change, from which corner of the world is the next big thing going to emerge? \n\nNone of this is against the argument that the markets will not correct. However, I do not think the examples of dot-com era or 08' are justified. I think something \"bigger\" than 25bps increase in rates is needed for US markets to crash and stay at those levels for longer periods of time. This is again based on my reasoning that there is a wider fundamental shift in how we live and consume in comparison to past.
