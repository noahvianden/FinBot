When you state a 56% gain, you're saying you capitalized on 56% of the net credit received upon opening the position, correct?\n\n2. Theta is good for sellers and bad for buyers because as time goes on, the potential for profit from a buyers side is less than less as the chances of the option being ITM (strategy wise) is shrinking and thus the value of the option decreases. This is bad for buyers because they may have paid $X at Time A but by Time B its now valued at $X-t(v) where t(v) is the time value decay. Conversely, this is good for sellers because they sold it at $X and could Buy-To-Close the option at $X-t(v) or let it expire worthless and keep $X; note, t(v) is assumed to be <$X at any given time. Is this understanding correct?\n\nMy account is only approved for Options Level 2 so I cannot do spreads yet, but I am having a time with what I have (mostly CSPs and CCs). What I have found confusing about the spreads, is that while I don't own the underlying on the short leg, I can still execute the short leg. That is, I don't need the 100 shares to create the leg of selling a 473 call in your case. Given my experience is at a lower level of options trading, selling a call has only be a CC position for me. So in the case of the bear spread, typically the stock price is below the short leg upon opening the position. If the stock price moves above that leg, the 473, but not above the long leg, the 477, wouldn't you be assigned at 473 and have to go out and buy the shares? I thought the purpose of the long leg was \"in lieu\" of having the underlying, or so this seems to be the case with a bull call spread given that the short leg is higher than the long leg and thus you could exercise the long leg to cover the short leg. \n\nTL;DR last paragraph, in a bear call spread why are you able to open a short position without owning the underlying? Isn't that naked shorting? Or is this option typically only available if you have the capital in your account to be able to buy the underlying should you be exercised on the call (such as a CSP)?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "1. Yes, I retained 56% of the net credit received when opening the trade.\n2. Theta is the rate of decay of the extrinsic value of the option, and that rate starts growing exponentially the closer it gets to expiration. [This free course from Tastytrade](https://tastytrade.thinkific.com/courses/beginner-options-course) explains and tests you on all the of option Greeks and is fantastic.\n\nAnd no, it's isn't naked shorting. The long leg in the spread acts as the cover for the short leg. This is what protects you from a theoretical unlimited loss on the call side, or the underlying price to zero on the put side.\n\nThe maximum loss for a credit spread is the width of the spread minus the credit received. In this case, it would have been $400 - $252 = $148 per spread (spread width of $4 X 100, minus 2.52 X 100 credit received X number of spreads). If $SPY had risen above both strikes of my spread and stayed there after expiration, both options would be ITM and would be automatically exercised, realizing my max loss of $148 per spread.\n\nI would never let that happen though, you should never let your spreads expire, **especially** if it's really close to the short strike. A scenario exists where the underlying moves after hours and breaches your short strike and is assigned before options exercise time cutoff, but your long leg won't automatically be exercised since it wasn't ITM at close. So depending on the spread, you'll be either long or short those shares at your short strike, which you'll have to buy to cover or sell after market open the next trading day and hope that the underlying hasn't moved too much in the meantime. This is called Pin Risk and you can lose a shit ton of money because of it. Buy back your spreads even if it's selling for .01.\n\nPin Risk is also why you can't do spreads without a margin account and the appropriate options level at your brokerage.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "But what if the long leg isn’t ITM? Suppose the underlying rises above the short leg, so now the short leg is ITM at expiry and is exercised. You have to buy the underlying shares to cover that short, right?\n\nI guess the loss is limited because you received premium from selling, but if the long leg (the cover) is never ITM to limit endless loss, if exercised on the short leg to me that seems naked if you don’t own the underlying. That is [Scenario 2](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/030414/what-bear-call-spread.asp) on Investopedia; obviously you could close the position before ever being exercised.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": ">But what if the long leg isn’t ITM?

You are describing Pin Risk and I covered that in the last two paragraphs of my previous post.\n\n**The only way** this can happen is if the underlying finishes between your strikes at expiration, or if the underlying moves between the strikes after expiration but before options exercise cutoff and the short buyer elects to exercise the option you sold them.\n\nThis cannot happen if you just close your spread. It's almost never worth it to let it expire worthless because the possibility of Pin Risk, no matter how small the probability. If your spread is well OTM, both legs will probably be selling for $0.01 each close to expiration. Paying the $2 to close the spread is cheap insurance and you should almost always do it.\n\nA spread is never technically naked because of the long leg, but Pin Risk is the **only** scenario in which you can lose more money than the defined risk you accept when you enter that particular spread.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I completely understand now.

{"title": "Should you listen to Jim Cramer? - I analyzed 20,000+ recommendations made by Jim Cramer during the last 5 years. Here are the results.", "selftext": "Jim Cramer has made 21,609 stock picks in the past 5 years! Let that sink in for a moment. Here is one person, making buy/sell/hold recommendations on more than 2,200+ different stocks across all types of industries. On average, he was making more than 20 picks per episode of his show \\[1\\]. This is a staggering number of picks to be made by one person! \\[2\\]\n\nWhile we can all argue about his expertise in making recommendations on such a wide array of industries and companies, what I wanted to know was:\n\n1. **How accurate were his recommendations?**\n2. **Would you have made or lost money if you followed them?**\n3. **Can you beat the market following his picks?**\n\nSo it’s high time that we put Cramer to the ultimate test and end the debate about his usefulness once and for all!\n\n**Analysis**\n\nThe data about all the stock picks made by Cramer are available [here](https://madmoney.thestreet.com/screener/index.cfm) \\[3\\]. The picks are classified into five segments (Buy, Hold, Sell, Positive/Negative mention). I have calculated the return for each segment separately \\[4\\] so that we can know what to focus on if we are trying to replicate this strategy.\n\nSince Cramer frequently contradicts his own picks and is mainly focused on short-term trades, I am only analyzing the stock returns for the following periods \\[5\\].\n\na. One-day\n\nb. One-Week\n\nc. One-Month\n\nGiven that Mad Money (Cramer’s Show) airs after the market closes, I have used the opening price of the next day for my calculations. (I.e If Cramer makes a recommendation on Thursday night, I use Friday opening price as the base for my calculations)\n\nAll the data used in the calculations are shared at the end.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Results**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/itrm7dpzn2a81.png?width=775&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2d3a98949ec48b9b068d2d8aeedf49837312ce3\n\n1-day performance of Cramer’s recommendations is excellent! On average, the Buy and Positive mention stocks went up by 0.03 and 0.05% respectively, and sell and negative mention stocks went down by 0.1 and 0.02%.\n\nAnother interesting fact is that ***you would not have lost money*** if you followed Cramer’s Buy recommendations. Across the time periods, his Buy recommendations have on average netted you positive returns \\[6\\]!\n\nHis sell recommendations did not pan out so well. Even though they dropped in price the next day, over the next week and month, they returned inline or even better than his buy recommendations!\n\nGiven that there is a counter-intuitive trend in the returns, let’s calculate the accuracy of his calls.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uyvba0c4o2a81.png?width=792&format=png&auto=webp&s=e5dde0f8578598dacc41ace2ebc6cfdcee8bfcde\n\nHere I am assigning a call as correct based on price change. If he gives a buy recommendation, I expect the price to go up and vice versa. As we can see from the chart above, his recommendations only do slightly better than a coin-toss. Even this only holds for short-term and buy recommendations with long-term sell recommendation performance dropping below 50% \\[7\\].\n\nWhile this narrow edge over the 50% mark can be used by algo-traders who have the ability to trade a large amount of stocks, if you are an average investor listening in on a Cramer show and hear about a stock recommendation, you might as well toss a coin to see if you should invest or not!\n\nFinally, it’s time we pit **Cramer against the market**. Do his recommendations beat the market?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p6foy9b5o2a81.png?width=1020&format=png&auto=webp&s=c1118daa78331deec390466759908ccbecebb2e6\n\nOh yeah! I was as surprised with the results as you are. I ran the numbers again and then one more time but got the exact same result! Cramer’s Buy recommendations beat the S&P 500 by a factor of 10 for the **one-day time frame**. But, if you held the stocks for anytime longer, you would have underperformed the market significantly.\n\nBefore you go daytrade on his recommendations you should know that the numbers we are seeing here are heavily influenced by outliers. If you miss out on the top 1% of recommendations (\\~110 stocks out of the 11,000+ buy recommendations he had made), your **1-day return would be -0.062% instead of +0.034** \\[8\\].\n\n**Limitations of the analysis**\n\nThe analysis has some limitations that you should be aware of before trying to replicate the strategy.\n\n1. As the astute among you might have noticed, if you sum up all the stocks used in the analysis it would only come to 18.5k. I removed \\~15% of the overall recommendations as either they did not have stock data present in Yahoo Finance/Alpha Vantage or the price data did not match with the one given on the Mad Money website.\n2. The data is obtained from the Mad Money website itself. I haven’t manually verified if the calls recorded on the website are in fact an accurate representation of the calls made by Cramer in his show. The below statement is given in their description and I am taking them on their word.\n\n>We are impartial in our recording and simply log exactly what was said. We do not interpret the calls. If a call is vague or in question we simply won't list it.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nNo matter the public opinion on Cramer, we can generate excellent 1-day returns following his buy recommendations (even beating the market in doing so!). Whether it’s due to his superior stock picking ability or whether it’s simply due to self-fulfilling prophecy \\[9\\] (as he has a wide audience who will act on his advice) is yet to be known.\n\nI would bet on the latter as, if the extraordinary one-day returns were in fact due to his superior stock-picking ability, the returns should have held over longer time periods, and also his sell recommendations would not have ended up performing better than his buy recommendations as we are observing here.\n\nIt only makes sense to listen to his advice if you are a day-trader or an algo-trader who is trading a large variety of stocks over short periods of time. For everyone else, just sticking to the S&P 500 would give you better returns over the long run!\n\n**Data**\n\nExcel file containing all the Recommendations and Financial data: [**Here**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1d0mooS_qsfePXChEDq2IDov_of_TFvD1/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=111668650548288730122&rtpof=true&sd=true)\n\n**Live tracker** containing the performance of Cramer’s 2021 picks: [**Here**](https://rows.com/market-sentiment/my-spreadsheets/untitled-spreadsheet-3-5C58Ix9kx1ixB0cM52DWZi/live) \\[10\\] (I will be updating this file regularly so that you can see his performance in real-time whenever you want to!)\n\n**Footnotes and existing research**\n\n**\\[1\\]** For those who don’t know, Cramer makes his picks in a CNBC show called [Mad Money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Money). Cramer himself defines the show as something which should be used for speculative/high-risk investing and not for your retirement portfolio.\n\n**\\[2\\]** For comparison purposes, an equity research analyst [covers only 10-25 companies](https://whatforwork.com/jobs/equity-research-analyst-sell-side/).\n\n**\\[3\\]** It’s not in an easily usable format. I had to parse the data from the webpage using Python (Beautiful Soup) - I have shared all the data used in this analysis as an Excel and Rows file at the end.\n\n**\\[4\\]** I did not calculate for Hold as he only made 27 hold recommendations, which is lower than what is required for a statistical significance.\n\n**\\[5\\]** In my [last post about Jim Cramer](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mtehdq/i_analyzed_all_700_buy_and_sell_recommendations/), there was a lot of controversy around how I calculated the time period. So here is the detailed version about how the time period is considered. For One-Day returns, we are considering that we will purchase the stock the next trading day after the market opens and then sells it at the end of the trading day. For weekly and monthly returns, I am using adjusted closing price since across a week or month there can be stock splits as well as dividends.\n\n**\\[6\\]** This can also be attributed to the market rally we have experienced over the last 5 years where a large majority of stocks went up.\n\n**\\[7\\]** 50% benchmark might be controversial with a lot of you (I agree given that if we are in a bull market there is more than a 50-50 chance of a stock going up tomorrow) → My rationale here is standing today looking at a stock, there are only two things that can happen tomorrow. It can either go up or go down. I assign equal probability to both given anything can happen tomorrow. The market can turn bearish, positive or negative news about the company can come up, etc. If you have a better logic for a benchmark, please do suggest!\n\n**\\[8\\]** But to be fair to Cramer, this is applicable to all types of Investment strategies and hedge funds! The performance of a few of the stocks in your portfolio will finally end up heavily influencing the returns of your overall portfolio. → Think of Tesla incase of ARK and FAANG in case of S&P 500.\n\n**\\[9\\]** There is some [existing research](https://scholarship.tricolib.brynmawr.edu/handle/10066/588) that deep dives into this topic.\n\n**\\[10\\]** Since it’s a live tracker using data from Alpha Vantage, the calculation is done slightly differently than in the analysis (in the live tracker I had to use the closing price on the day of recommendation instead of the opening price of the next day). I will be updating it to follow the same process as the analysis as soon as I get info from Alpha Vantage.", "id": "rxf0xi", "created_utc": 1641476994.0, "score": 1763, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 188, "comments": [{"body": "Hey Guys,\n\nWishing you an amazing year ahead.

All of ARK’s other ETFs, including the latest, ARK Transparency (CTRU)—launched in December—are also deep in negative territory.  \n\nGrowth stocks fell on Wednesday after the latest minutes from the Federal Reserve’s December policy meeting were released, suggesting that the central bank’s rate increases might be earlier and faster than market has expected. \n\nInvestors were spooked as Fed Chairman Jerome Powell shifted his tone to emphasize the risks of inflation—after months of describing rising prices as “transitory”—as a new Covid-19 variant is rampaging across the country and causing supply-chain disruptions.\n\nThe S&P 500 lost 2% in the last two hours of Wednesday’s trading, growth stocks within the index tumbled 3%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped 3.3%. \n\nBut the ARK ETFs were some of the worst-performing funds amid Wednesday’s decline. Besides ARK Innovation, ARK Genomic Revolution (ARKG) was down 7.1%, ARK Fintech Innovation (ARKF) dropped 6.6%, and ARK Next Generation Internet (ARKW) fell 6.2%. Other groups of growth stocks, such as blockchain, cannabis, clean energy, and technology, were also deep in the red. \n\nWednesday’s loss was just the latest stretch of ARK funds’ year-long struggle. ARK ETFs were some of the best-performing funds in 2020, soaring an average of 150% as the pandemic accelerated the adoption of many emerging platforms and technologies that companies in its portfolios own.\n\nSince peaking in February 2021, however, the funds have been tumbling downhill, shedding much of their gains from the year before. Rising inflation has made the future cash flow of growth-oriented innovation firms less valuable today, and investors were seeking returns from safer corners, such as cheaply traded cyclical stocks.\n\nWith the Fed’s hawkish pivot, it looks like the volatility in growth stocks and ARK funds will continue. But if inflation can be somewhat contained following the Fed’s tightening policy in 2022, innovation stocks might embrace some rebound—though that won’t be anytime soon.", "id": "rx3i2u", "created_utc": 1641437674.0, "score": 654, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 326, "comments": [{"body": "With investing there's never any patience from the masses.

Market agrees. \n\nTesla is the leader. Tesla has higher margin profile because of vertically integration (parts, services and technology), driving battery costs lower, BEV manufacturing expertise and FSD software revenue. Q3 operating margin was 15%. Q4 will soon be reported in 18-20% range and continue to drive higher towards mid 20s durning this year. Toyota’s operating margin has been in 7-10% range for many years. \n\nThat model you mentioned assumes $45 earnings in 2030. Tesla might get there in 2024 considering how their production capacity and operating leverage are trending. Tesla’s margins have a lot of room to improve as FSD continues to improve and in-house battery production ramps up. \n\nTesla is more than a car company. It has a car dealership/services network, energy generation and storage products, energy arbitrage services, charging network, insurance and FSD. \n\nThere are a bunch of  optionalities with huge potential : robotaxi, AI infrastructure as a service, boats, eVOL, battery vendor and humanoids. Wallstreet hasn’t put those in their models but investors love free optionalities .", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": ">I have seen numerous tesla valuation models for 2030 where tsla is predicted to sell 16 million cars at an average selling price of 42k dollars and a P/E at 70. All this will amount to a price per share of 3200 and a market cap of aroudn 3 trillion.\n\nYou mean discounted back to today numbers? There is no mathematical way that the numbers you gave would result in only $3 trillion market cap by 2030. Just do the math. The numbers would mean that their net margin is a measley 6%, which is way lower than Toyota, GM, and even Tesla's TTM. If you assume a more bullish net margin of 15% with the rest of your numbers, you get $7 trillion.\n\nNow, I don't think TSLA will be trading at 70 P/E in 2030. Their growth trajectory will probably be less than now, unless Tesla Bot has completely succeeded or something. Even then, assuming half of that plus 15% net margin and your other numbers, their *auto business alone* would be worth $3.5 trillion in 2030. Keep in mind their intention is to deploy equal amount of batteries to Tesla Energy by 2030.\n\nMeanwhile, Toyota has less margins than Tesla, and if Elon is correct, will continue to have less margin. **Therefore, the ASP is not important, but rather the margin on each car.** Additionally, Toyota trades at 10 P/E because its CAGR. Auto is not a growing industry. In fact, it is very much shrinking. That's not great news for the market leader. However, EVs as a percentage of the automotive pie is growing rapidly, therefore justifying Tesla's projected CAGR. Therefore, fundamentally the CAGR demands a higher P/E currently. However, who knows what Tesla would demand in P/E by 2030. That would depend on Tesla's future prospects at that time, which no one knows.\n\nKeep in mind that Tesla is pocketing both the tier one supplier's margins on the infotainment side (30%) and the dealer margin (8%) along with plenty of other things.

Number of contracts and delta are determined by desired yield and account size. My target return is 12%/year with these. This is currently putting me at 4 contracts around 5 delta.\n   * **Management**:  For the short puts, I will add another position if the original is >21DTE and >50% profit. The new position delta/size will be determined by the strangle delta, total /ES position delta, and total portfolio delta. I will close any short put for a loss if <-300% and re-open at similar delta/size if >21DTE. For the short calls, I will close for a loss if <-500% and re-open at similar delta/size if >21DTE. If these are getting tested near expiration, I will close for whatever gain/loss at the time to avoid gamma risk. Otherwise, I will let them expire worthless.\n   * **Notes**: [Spintwig](https://spintwig.com/spy-short-call-strategy-performance/) has taught us that SPY 45DTE short calls are not profitable. The 5 delta are almost breakeven. But I'm willing to live with that as this adds a little negative delta to my otherwise super positive portfolio delta.\n* **Strategy #3 - Short Puts on Individual Equities (20% of 2021 Gains)**\n   * **Background**: This is just your basic CSP stuff here except naked (cash secured is not capital efficient and cannot beat buy/hold). I try to diversify amidst all the major sectors.\n   * **The Trade**: Write 45DTE, 20 delta short puts. Size the number of contracts to use no more than 1% BPR.\n   * **Management**: Pretty standard TW exit/rolling techniques here. Will look to start taking profits around 50%+ if the DTE trade-off is worth it. I'll also take profits if it's 30%+ in a few days and/or earnings are coming up. If ITM and decent extrinsic value left, I will wait to roll until expiration day upon which I will roll to the next monthly for a credit choosing a strike based upon my sentiment. If it's deep ITM, I will look for a high IV day to roll. Of course, I'll only roll if I'm still bullish on the underlying. I avoid taking assignment at all costs.\n   * **Notes**: The 1% position sizing is important. If 1 position goes bad (and it will), my whole portfolio isn't stuck in the mud. I also used to add short calls as defense (5-10 delta) when my short puts went -100% but I rarely do this anymore due to whipsaw. Also, regarding earnings, as long as the ER isn't within 2 weeks, I don't care.\n* **Strategy #4 - Selling Lottos (50% of 2021 Gains)**\n\nI'm just going to copy/paste my detailed comment from the [lotto thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/PMTraders/comments/pr84cp/lets_talk_about_lottos/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) earlier this year:\n\n**DTE and strike**\n\n|DTE|Strike|\n|:-|:-|\n|0DTE|25%+ OTM|\n|1-2DTE|35%+ OTM|\n|3-4DTE|40%+ OTM|\n|7-9DTE|50%+ OTM|\n\n**Exclusion list**\n\n* No earnings or binary events within DTE timeframe\n   * Note some underlyings are closely correlated with others so have to be careful when these others have ER (ie DKNG w/ PENN, ROKU w/ NFLX, etc.)\n* Exclude biotech, memes, WSB faves (old and new), new IPOs, low market cap (<$10B), high short float (>10%), etc.\n* Check for news within 2 weeks for red flags (buyout rumors, SP inclusion, etc.)\n* Check the 1YR plot and verify it doesn't look like an EKG chart\n\n**Position sizing**\n\n* All of the below analysis is done in TOS via \"Analyze\" tab before sending any order and is what determines the max number of contracts\n   * Stress the position up/down to the strike and make sure the analyzed BPR would not cause a margin call\n   * Stress the position up/down to the strike and make sure that |PNR|>|EPR|\n   * Check other [TOS PM house rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/PMTraders/comments/q4phpl/td_ameritrade_additional_portfolio_margin_house/) (mainly SPX beta test and short unit test unless 0DTE)\n\n**Management**\n\n* Techniques to use when getting tested\n   * Buy/short shares\n   * Write puts/calls to delta hedge\n   * Convert into a spread (likely locks in a loss)\n   * Roll out to next week (only do this if strikes are high enough and IV is still elevated)\n* Hard stop at -1000%\n\n**Hedging (new for 2022)**\n\n* As I have decided to go full blown into lotto short puts in addition to calls, I want 6-sigma hedges. So, every week I will buy SPY 30DTE 10%OTM puts using 10% of my farthest dated short put lotto premium (maybe just use 5% of total lotto premium for furthest lotto DTE to make the math easier).\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n* **Leverage**\n\n|VIX|Max BPu|Max Delta Leverage (SPY Beta Weighted Delta / NLV x SPY)|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|40+|50%|2.5X|\n|30-40|40%|2.25X|\n|20-30|35%|2X|\n|15-20|30%|1.75X|\n|10-15|25%|1.5X|\n\nNote that I don't include lottos in my BPu due to reasoning below:\n\nWhen I check and report my BPu, I will actually de-select all my lotto positions on TOS. Why? Because only a market crash down has the potential to margin call me. So all of my lotto naked calls (usually around 70%) are safe - BPu will shrink on these in such a scenario or I could close out for a penny if needed. The remaining lotto puts (30%), are potentially far enough OTM and short enough DTE that I can ride those out. But I’m fully willing to close these for big losses in such a black swan scenario.\n\n* **Black Swan Hedges**\n   * **Background**: I still have PTSD from 3/12/20.\n   * **The Trade**: When VIX > $20, buy 7DTE, 10% OTM puts every week for 0.04% of NLV. When VIX < $20, buy 30DTE, 20% OTM puts every week for 0.04% of NLV. Also, when VIX < $15, buy 120DTE, 10 delta VIX calls every month for 0.08% of net liq. Do the math and this is a total of 3%/year portfolio drag.\n   * **Management**: Hopefully these expire worthless until I'm dead. But if not, I'll only close these for profit if I'm closing other positions for loss. TBH, I'm not entirely sure how I'll manage these when the next 6-sigma event happens, but I know I'll be glad I had them.\n   * **Notes**: VIX hedge based on [Option Alpha YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-luY8MHgYW0).

And I actually meant to point this out, but this is where I basically went to naked puts instead of pseudo-CSPs (full blown lottos didn't really come until late 2020). \n\nMy point being (if it isn't clear yet haha), leverage/naked is your only chance at outperforming the market in the long run.", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Have you ever considered reinvesting your profits from lotto's into scratch off's at the gas station?\n\nIf you arb your alpha vs. the state maybe it's +EV unlike a cash secured wheel?", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Link me to the spintwig back-test plz", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "[The Ultimate Guide](https://spintwig.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-cost-effective-road-cycling/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nyour welcome, now 1% of profits per month as a fee", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "This is great thanks for the write up and congrats!

Thanks for everything you've shared. I know your post last year inspired me quite a bit with my trading. A couple questions:   \n\n\n1. For Strategy #2, have you considered adding /RTY or /NQ to your strangle strategy? If not, could you explain why? /RTY was my big winner in 2021. I know the potential moves can be larger on the small caps, but the premiums per unit BP dedicated to the strategy are richer.   \n\n2. I'm having a hard time simulating your black swan hedges. Let's say my NLV is $250K and VIX is 19 and SPY is 468. You would be in the 20% OTM 30 DTE SPY put category, which for me would be only spending $100/week, correct? So I could afford around 3 x 375p on the 29 DTE chain. I ran a quick SPX stress test and on a -20% move this hedge only reduces P/L open losses 17%. On a larger -35% move this hedge reduces my P/L open losses by 34%. I know this is very specific to my portfolio and open positions, but it seems like not enough protection (perhaps this is just a function of me being over-leveraged?). I'm wondering if my math above (in terms of amount spent on the hedge) is correct and how much you calculate this black swan hedge to protect you during various drawdown scenarios.  \n\n3. For lotto plays, do you ever make the positions vertical credit spreads / short iron condors?  I feel a certain way about such a large notional exposure to a single ticker, and while a spread reduces the premium collected it also significantly reduces max loss.  \n\n*cross posted these questions on PMT", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": ">Great post!

I know the potential moves can be larger on the small caps, but the premiums per unit BP dedicated to the strategy are richer.\n\nI have nothing against trading /RTY or /NQ and there many on PMT who do some combination of all three. However, I am extremely familiar with /ES by now so I prefer to trade something I'm comfortable with. \n\n>I'm having a hard time simulating your black swan hedges.

I'm wondering if my math above (in terms of amount spent on the hedge) is correct and how much you calculate this black swan hedge to protect you during various drawdown scenarios.\n\nThe black swan hedges were not designed to completely eliminate losses in such a scenario. For me, they are to cushion the blow and perhaps more importantly, put me farther away from a margin call. So, I paid just as much attention to BP Effect as P/L when back-testing these hedges.\n\nIf you are targeting/averaging/on pace for 50% P/L YTD, then perhaps you increase the hedges from 2%/year to 5%/year. You could also dynamically hedge according to your personal portfolio positions and risk tolerance at the time. Ultimately, it's up to you to decide!\n\n>For lotto plays, do you ever make the positions vertical credit spreads / short iron condors?  I feel a certain way about such a large notional exposure to a single ticker, and while a spread reduces the premium collected it also significantly reduces max loss.\n\nI do not. Most of the time, I'm trading at strikes at or near the top/bottom of the options chains so spreads/condors are not viable. I suppose calendars could be an idea but the liquidity out in lotto-land is so poor that it might not be worth it.

{"title": "SAVA scheduled for a flight to Pluto on February 21st (in 45 days). All Abord!!!", "selftext": " \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/znd7bx210z981.png?width=251&format=png&auto=webp&s=cdde29303e3fc325f2edce0f447b96cec31ae6d6\n\nMy gains.  \n\nAssociate Professor of Internal Medicine here. I just consulted my green crayons, and I must report my findings. First, they were delicious. Second, I have a disproportionately asymmetric risk-reward opportunity for you smooth brains, and I kept this post brief (relative to my previous post), so focus. Let’s not squander this opportunity.\n\n**TLDR:** \n\n1. Five months ago, shorts filed a report with the FDA alleging SAVA manipulated its data leading to a drop in the price. The report demanded halting drug trials to protect patients but forgot to mention a single safety issue (in over 70 pages). LMAO. You can not make this up. The price fell over 66% in the aftermath because we all know how theatrical Mr. Market is. The FDA must respond to the allegations within 150-180 days from the date of the accusations depending on the manner of filing. Because the false assertions cratered the stock price, I believe when the FDA, the principal governing authority of late-stage clinical trials, dismisses irrelevant preclinical claims backed by kindergarten logic, then I anticipate price recovery. **In this post, I will explain why the FDA will dismiss the allegations and SAVA will recover its losses (432% gains).**\n2. **Then I summarize how SAVAge Cassava Sciences Investor base is. We, patients at risk for AD, families of AD patients, Scientists, and Physicians have rallied around historical bulletproof, \\*clinical\\* data.**\n3. &#x200B;\n\n**Math Class:**\n\nStock price’s ATH was $147. It fell to 34 = 77% after allegations\n\nThirty-four back to 147 is an increase of 432%.\n\n**Complete recovery means the price will Increase 432%, not 66%.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**A quick recap of the data and stock runup:**\n\nFor this discussion, understand SAVA has had two trials. A 28-day trial (completed) and an ongoing OLE/CMS trial (both in Phase 2). As these trials progressed and respective data released, the stock went parabolic, why? **In its entirety, data this robust, to this degree, duration, and consistency has never been seen in the Alzheimer’s space**. In summary, A full panel of 17 biomarkers showed a positive response to Simufilam (SAVA’s drug) in the 28-day trial. Then the OLE/CMS trial released Cognitive data at 6, 9, and 12 months, dazzling SAVAges with each release. In this time, the price went from under $5 to over $140 (Market cap of 5 billion+). As a physician and patient advocate, I might be excited about the data, but Mr. Market makes me look relatively dull. \n\nWhy did the market value the data at 5 billion? [ Michael Engelsgjerd](https://www.bizjournals.com/austin/news/2021/11/19/cassava-science-drug-trials-sec-investigation.htm), A senior equity research analyst at Bloomberg who specializes in the biotech sector, said it best: \n\n***\"If you can develop a small molecule pill for Alzheimer's disease that can definitively improve cognition, that would very likely become the most successful product in pharmaceutical history.\"*** \n\nPut simply, this is precisely what Simufilam accomplished. Definitive cognitive improvement with a small molecule pill. I can not overstate the data’s significance, as Alzheimer's currently has no effective treatment and is the 6th leading cause of death. Based on the TAM, probability of FDA approval, and similar metrics, the price was expected to appreciate more than $1000 by the approval date (valuation model below for wrinkle-brained investors). Great, right? Well, that’s when all the drama started, and it's been one hell of a rollercoaster since.  \n\nBut before we move on, for effect, Here is SImufilam’s data compared to placebo and Donanemab (competition). Aduhelm’s (another competitor) data thus far, is worse than Donanemab’s results.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4mui1zs60z981.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=02dc23fb4794b0d2b41878ffeb3ff7f01f21f4be\n\n**Short Allegation Destroy Shareholder Value:** \n\nOn August 2021, a short report was filed with the FDA (called a citizen’s petition) to halt further testing to protect patients. The claims, by Dr. Pitt and Dr. Bredt (more on them later), asked the FDA to stop further research in the interest of patient safety; however, the report 70-page report and five supplements mentioned no significant adverse events. Here is the full [report](https://www.regulations.gov/docket/FDA-2021-P-0930/document) for your viewing pleasure. You might assume the price action signified the|accusations had merit or a chance of succeeding. You would be wholly incorrect. Unfortunately, libel has a real and immediate impact, substantiated or not. Institutions and many investors positively won’t Hodl an already risky/binary biotech play. Pragmatic but unfortunate because, again, the shorts could not point to a single safety issue related to the drug after more than 147,000 dosing events in human trials (Facts). Wait, wait, let me get this correct. Let us illuminate this concept one step at a time:\n\n1) The FDA is the ONLY governing authority for human/clinical trials that will halt trials. \n\n2) The FDA will only halt phase 3 trials to ensure patient safety. \n\n3) Dr. Pitt and Dr. Bredt say they want the FDA to halt Phase 3 because of safety issues. \n\n4) But Dr. Pitt and Dr. Bredt cannot point to a single safety issue after 147,000+ doses? The summary of the number of doses can be found [here](https://www.sava-ad.com/post/citizen-s-petition-to-fda-for-expedited-approval-of-simufilam), and again here is the [report](https://www.regulations.gov/docket/FDA-2021-P-0930/document) filed by Pitt and Bredit.\n\n5) Thus IMO, there is NO chance of the FDA halting trials.\n\nI am not being facetious. This is not hyperbole. It is exactly what Dr. Bredt and Dr. Pitt are saying. LMAO. Every time I review this, Im verbatim am at a loss for words. Worse, I can’t believe Mr. Market overreacted on this ‘news.’ The bottom line is there is NO way the FDA will halt phase 3 trials. I can not illustrate it any clearer for you smooth brains, but for emphasis, please repeat after me; the medication is safe, so trials will continue, **and continue they did**. **The FDA allowed not one but two separate phase 3 trials to begin, and the OLE and CMS Phase 2 trials continue (after reviewing the allegations).** Since the allegations were made, the continuation and initiation across four separate SAVA trials SHOULD be enough evidence the allegations will be dismissed; however, Mr. Market can't stop sniffing crayons. Please give Mr. Market some time. When he realizes he was wrong, he will look like a deer in headlights and drop his crayons as the price recovers leading up to the citizen’s petition dismissal. IMO. **More importantly, this is your buying opportunity**. If I have to tell you that I don’t have a crystal ball and can not predict the future, you should stop reading. My opinions are based on the above and below evidence.  Do your own DD; I could be wrong (but I’m probably not ;)).\n\n**Need More Evidence?**\n\nBelow is a tweet essentially admitting the allegations (CP) will be dismissed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a84qpth90z981.png?width=770&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1f1c56cd14553c388e56edd2567abcb10785a9d\n\nYou will find exactly ZERO cases of medications with promising clinical data, halted by anyone, FDA/SEC/NIH/IRB when there is no safety issue (let's throw the DOJ and the FBI in there because that's what the Adrain et al. are trying). A safety assessment was the entire point of conducting phase 2 trials, and phase 2 confirmed Simufilam is safe. The FDA would not allow SAVA to start Phase 3 (as the FDA did already) if they were worried about safety. A nuanced point for those who thoroughly reviewed the data: Under no circumstance is it acceptable to halt phase 3.\n\n**Still More Evidence:**\n\nOn November 4th, The Journal of Neuroscience (A third-party) responded to the allegations against $SAVA. **They stated, \"there are no signs of data manipulation.\" SAVA price increased 100% in 3 days.** I anticipate a similar market reaction when a more significant governing authority (the FDA) dismisses the false allegations. \n\n**Remi The Diamond Handed Heathen Barbarian (AKA Chief SAVAge):**\n\nSAVA Insiders have been BUYING. Remi (the CEO) has accumulated over a million shares. It’s difficult to overstate how bullish it is for a biotech CEO to go full silverback with his own coin on the open market buying up his own stock and then diamond handing it through trials (when he sees unreleased/ongoing data and knows more than any of us). Sanford (another board member) accumulated over 900,000 shares starting 9/17/20. Both have massive gains on their positions currently, but they still have not [sol](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/sava/insider-activity)d.\n\n[Compare](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/CRTX/insider-trades/) SAVA insider buying to another Alz drug in trials like Cosyntex. Here is their insider trading. Take a look, and then guess whether the trial data that dropped in Q4 ended up good or bad:\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eu4s6wkg0z981.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=196ed053083cae9e70a8e9bd583f78b84c9a24cf\n\nReady?  Okay, the data readout was “primary endpoints were not met” meaning the study failed. Insiders were selling big time and for a big reason. \n\nNow let’s look at SAVA:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yxisqrui0z981.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2ee063b74d1266c778ff3760281d3f574e266cf\n\n[https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/SAVA/insider-trades/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/SAVA/insider-trades/)\n\nSAVA is sitting on tons of unreleased Phase 2 data (visible to its board), and the final Phase 3 trials are ongoing. The insider trading activity speaks for itself.  **As Peter Lynch said, “Insiders sell for many reasons, but they buy for only one reason.”** \n\nTo reiterate, the insiders have only accumulated and held for over two years. The smooth brain market won’t stop its bedwetting until the FDA ultimately dismisses the allegation. IMO, that date will be on/or before February 21st, 2022. In some instances, the FDA may respond by the deadline and say they are extending, but as long as the FDA does not halt trials SAVA is on its way to FDA approval. As discussed above, IMO, the sky will fall before the FDA halts trials.\n\n**But Im, an intermediate-term swing trader with erectile dysfunction. What do you have for me, Professor?**\n\nThere will be another tremendous catalyst for those interested in an intermediate-term opportunity. SAVA collaborated with CUNY School of Medicine to develop this revolutionary drug, Simufilam. When the Shorts attacked the consulting scientist and his work, Remi, the CEO, asked CUNY to investigate the matter to ensure the integrity and offer transparency (because that's what the guilty do, right? right.) A review of CUNY's protocol shows that CUNY will announce its conclusion on or before 210 days (March-ish). \n\nSAVA is also expecting to release biomarker data soon. Historically, SAVA has released interim data-keeping investors up to date. As discussed above, SAVA is sitting on a lot of data to be released.  \n\nOther potential drivers of price action include:\n\n* A SI of 40%. (ATH’s)\n* A float of less than 40 million.\n* A dedicated investor base will never sell unless the data changes (The next TSLA, anyone?)\n\nAll this information is for short-term/ intermediate-term traders. Long or short, expect massive price swings over the next several months.  \n\n**I have more wrinkles than these degenerate smooth brains and rock-solid erections, so what do you have, Professor?**\n\n[The DATA](https://www.sava-ad.com/post/citizen-s-petition-to-fda-for-expedited-approval-of-simufilam)\n\nWhy did I invest in this nauseating rollercoaster ride? Because of the cognition data. Dr. Pitt and Dr. Bredt will shift the narrative to preclinical science, but the cognition data eclipses all. The clinical data are the results we see in walking talking patients. Briefly, if a medication kills humans (clinical data), it does not matter what your western blot says (pre-clinical data). **The FDA will never ignore dying humans for western blots. The opposite is also true.** Simufilam’s CLINICAL data shows cognitive and behavioral improvement.  This is all that matters at this stage of testing, and simply put, it is EPIC. Read about why critics shift the narrative here: “[Why the Critics are Tuning Out the Cognition Data](https://www.sava-ad.com/post/opinion-why-the-critics-are-tuning-out-the-cognition-data).”\n\n**Simufilam's data shows it is:** \n\n**1). Safe**\n\n**2) Effective** \n\n**3) Desperately needed by Alzheimers patients.** \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Before shorts attack the integrity of the Cognition data:**\n\nIt was collected over sixteen clinical sites, across the US and Canada, by physician principal investigators and their associated staff (unaffiliated with Cassava Sciences). These sites also perform trials for AD drugs by Biogen and Eli Lilly. These clinical sites can be audited by the IRB at any time. Additionally, the chain of custody was made transparent and verified by two independent biostatisticians. The sponsor (SAVA) maintains a master file with all the raw data (including excluded patients and why they were excluded) which can be audited by the FDA at any time. CRA’s, third parties to both Cassava Sciences and the clinical sites, monitor the ADAS scores, review the raw data and adjust scores to ensure consistency and integrity. SAVA uses electronic data capture, which permanently records the data submitted by the independent clinical sites, and the software logs all addendums with time stamps. With that out of the way…\n\nLong-term investors can expect valuation metrics to drive the price over 750-1000 within two years. Here is a full breakdown of TAM and why [SAVA](https://www.sava-ad.com/post/opinion-sava-may-be-a-once-in-a-lifetime-opportunity.) is so valuable. A common psychological phenomenon is a disbelief resulting in rejection of simple math. It’s simple math, so look it over with an open mind.\n\nI must always share my favorite summary of how much the market values Alzheimer's treatment.  \n\n***On Monday, June 7th, $BIIB announced Accelerated Approval of its Alzheimer's medication, and the market cap increased by $17 billion in one day. Similarly, the day $LLY and $RHBBY announced FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) of their AD medication, their market cap increased by $15 billion and $13 billion, respectively (on the same day). All three of these medications demonstrated little to no cognitive benefit (SAVA data is vastly superior).*** \n\nSAVA's market cap sits at less than two billion dollars currently (get in while you can). The last point is, I invested in the data, the expected data updates are integral to my investment thesis. I’ll be awaiting those, and changes in the data will change my investment.\n\n**House cleaning:**\n\nI spared the details of the drama surrounding this stock, but to update those that follow me: our group of Scientist investors together we have written a 48-page research report on SAVA [here, \"A Comprehensive Stock Analysis\"](https://www.sava-ad.com/post/cassava-sciences-sava-comprehensive-stock-analysis). \n\nThe Authors include\n\nClinical and Academic Neurologists, \n\nMDs, \n\nPhDs, \n\nPharmDs, \n\nSuccessful biotech investors \n\nAn Chief Global Strategist and Healthcare Leader\n\nThrough my investing career, IMO, the first thing you will notice about successful investors is the amount of data they examine closely to see what others miss. Mr. Market's \"headline hysteria\" usually means buying opportunities for them (“overreaction with reversion to the mean”).\n\nSAVA's YT presence had grown courtesy of the one and only OG Joe Springer (He was a bull when SAVA was $6).  \n\nIf you have dyslexia and prefer to watch (not read), please watch [ Dr. Boyers (Academic and Clinical Neurologist) discuss SAVA's medication with Joe Springer here](https://youtu.be/h55Rio8qhy8).\n\n**Did I mention SAVA’s historical data and Alzheimer’s patients, families, physicians, and scientists have become a dedicated investor base rallying around the historical data? We are investors that will not sell unless the data changes.** \n\nWith the allegations expiring and the CUNY investigation ending, our SAVAge group plans to start pitching to tutes.  \n\n**Lastly:**\n\n**The clinical data is historical and bulletproof, and I will not let this fact get lost.** There is no point in arguing. If you genuinely believe SAVA is a fraud and the FDA will halt trials, then place your (ill-informed losing) bets. What shorts and longs agree on is that SAVA does not know how to go sideways. It will either orbit Pluto or implode to $7 (cash price).  \n\nAnyone with genuine questions or who believes my trusted experts and I missed something, I look forward to a civil discussion.  \n\nAll the above represent my own opinions.

I kept an eye on it, and it eventually went back down to the $30s in May.  I opened a position with 100 shares and kept adding as it rose, eventually settling with 500 shares at a high $58s average.

That does not mean the FDA requires a placebo arm and it does not mean the medication is not effective.  \n\nBelow is the analysis that clearly shows selection bias is not a factor.  \n\nFrom the CP filed with the FDA:\n\nA more comprehensive look into the literature concerning AD, ADAS-Cog, and placebo reveals the treatment effect is highly probable and placebo effect unlikely.\n\n\nA meta-analysis (https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jalz.2009.05.665) published by Ito et al. looked at placebo response data in 19,972 patients between 1990 and 2008. The disease progression in mild to moderate AD patients was estimated at 5.5 points per year.\n\n\nThe disease progression model proposed by Ito et al. shows the expected cognitive decline over time within a 90% prediction interval (shaded area). This suggests a limit to the observed placebo effect as patients do not typically improve from baseline past six months. In a follow-up analysis\n\n (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23803296/), Ito et al. also highlight that the placebo response tends to be more significant in the first few months.\n\nA follow-up meta-analysis by [Zhang et al](https://alzres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13195-020-00630-5). also looked at placebo response data in 19,210 patients between 1992 and 2019. The disease progression rate was estimated at 5.82 points per year. It's also suggested that placebo effect plateaus at approximately 16 weeks in clinical trials.\n\n\nSimufilam's ADAS-cog data superimposed on Cohorts mentioned above shows placebo effect waned at 6 months.\n\nThe data from Ito et al. and Zhang et al. all conclude that the placebo effect has its limits. A similar pattern can be seen by evaluating the placebo group of Aduhelm. Placebo's effect is less robust and shorter-term. Based on the three sizable cohorts, clear cognitive decline is expected and undeniable as measured by ADAS-Cog. Further, it is predictable and measurable. Across the two metal analyses and Aduhelm trial the ADAS-Cog declined from 5.2 to 5.8 point decline. If a treatment group can show a large enough benefit, such as an improvement from baseline ADAS-Cog at twelve months or greater. In that case this is likely beyond the extent of the observed placebo effect in published literature. We will discuss the significant treatment effect noted below.\n\n\nTaking a closer look at the delta between the placebo cohorts (discussed above) and the OLE ADAS-Cog data, overall, the delta is an astonishing 8.2-9.2. In addition, subgroup analysis shows 68% of the patients had an improvement of ADAS-Cog of 6.8. This cohort's delta is 11.8 to 12.6. A placebo effect can not explain this, in my estimation.\n\n\nSuppose the FDA is looking for a twenty percent decline in the rate of the natural progression of AD, then that is equivalent to ADAS-cog 4.64 - 4.16. and respective deltas of 1.16 -1.04 based on the 40,000+ placebo cohort. Effectively Simufilam would have to perform at 14% of its OLE data to get approval based on FDA's treatment of Aduhelm, Donanemab, Gantenerumab. The three mentioned AD medications had received AA or BTD based on inferior clinical response to Simufilam. This, plus considering the supportive surrogate data, makes Phase 3 a foregone conclusion.\n\n\nLets review trials with already approved AD medications from open label data. Does open-label status make the data look more positive than it should be? This study (Safety and Efficacy of Donepezil HCl 23 mg in Patients With Moderate to Severe Alzheimer's Disease - Study Results) and this study (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2034585) of existing AD drug donepezil was open-label. Yet, patients declined after six months, which is not significantly different from the randomized control data. This implies that when it comes to AD, an open-label and a controlled study gives similar results.\n\nThe bonus structure of SAVA is irrelevant as it has not been paid out yet:\n\nDuring the six months ended June 30, 2021, the Company achieved 10 Valuation Milestones triggering potential Company obligations to all Plan participants from a minimum of $81.0 million up to a hypothetical maximum of $195.0 million, to be determined by the Compensation Committee. However, no compensation expense has been recorded since no grant date has occurred and no Performance Conditions are considered probable of being met. (taken directly from SEC form 10Q)\n\n\nThose skeptical of Cassava often reference the bonus program as evidence of a pump and dump scheme. However, that seems very unlikely considering the cash bonus plan requires SAVA to achieve a merger / acquisition, or have enough cash on hand to pay the bonus incentive. At this point in time, neither of those two conditions are being met. \n\nAdditionally, SAVA’s share price was ~$8 in December of 2020. Throughout 2021, although SAVA hit an all-time high share price of $146, none of the insiders sold shares in the company. Even though SAVA stock has closed at upwards of a 10x multiplier of its December 2020 high, insiders chose not to sell. That being said, the likelihood of a “pump and dump” scheme is considerably unlikely. \n\n\nWell I thought this all sounded odd, so I dug into the 10Q to figure out what the actual deal was. It turns out that the bonus for the 5B market cap is NOT 350 or 320M as I have seen quoted in various comments, but is actually 50M, IN AGGREGATE, meaning the CEO gets one third of the 50M pool, and other roles get smaller percentages of the aggregate bonus figure. So the CEO’s actual bonus here is closer to 16.75M, which is a nice chunk of change, but not anywhere near what I would think would be motivation or compelling for a mere P&D scheme. He stands to make far, FAR more off stock or options if the company can reach a higher market cap than 5B. Also note that many CEOs, such as Elon Musk, get far more generous CEO stock compensation plans. This is all normal stuff.\n\n\nNote that the board must agree that there is adequate money to pay the bonus and right now the money is set aside for the trials. Remi owns approximately 2,000,000 shares and didn't sell a single one as it rose to $146/share. He believed in the company so much he bought shares on the open market the same as a retail investor.
