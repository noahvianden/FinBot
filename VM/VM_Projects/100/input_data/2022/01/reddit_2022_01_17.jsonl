However, stronger dollar makes purchases from the emerging economies cheaper, but the emerging economies rather prefer to have the capital invested to grow their infrastructure etc. Hence the noise.

That's something that basically never happens with public transit, at least not in my lifetime.\n\nBecause public transit systems are usually so slow to build, and seem to always go over budget, it makes it very hard for cities to expand their systems to meet demand. Cities (at least in the west) usually:\n\n* Start with a small system, but it's so small and has such limited service that most people don't use it, and so there's very little public support for spending more on it\n* Start with a \"big\" system, which almost always takes much longer to build than expected and costs more to build and operate than originally estimated. And so even if the system is popular, there's not the political will to commit to any expansion. And if it is popular, it ends up crowded during rush hour, and so riders end up dissatisfied\n\nThere are some bigger cities, that start with a few lines that do well, and then they add other similar sized lines to connect other boroughs/neighborhoods/suburbs. But they still run in to problems expanding capacity along existing lines. Digging more tunnels or adding more cars or expanding stations can be incredibly expensive and also disruptive to service.\n\nEven if a Boring tunnel \"loop\" never ends up being as efficient as a subway line, or as flexible as bus service, it can still make a lot of sense.

For some reason WS analysts aren't being logical/rational and as a result the stock price is disconnected from its inherent/intrinsic value. If you beliebe over time that the price will re-connect with reality/the fundamentals, in theory, it's a good speculative investment.\n\nThe analysts don't have a good way to justify their low eps afaik. My going theory however is that the most valuable thing to an analyst is their reputation. It's much more damaging to an analysts reputation if they overstimate EPS and the company misses, than if they underestimate EPS and a company beats. And that's why i believe analysts typically err on the side of caution and lean on conservative estimates.\n\nFurthermore nothing prevents them from giving the stock a Buy or Hold rating and also low estimates.

Tesla uses these in Model S/X, but as noted above they generate more heat and weigh more, therefore are less efficient than permanent magnet brushless motors. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBMW appears to be using DC brush motors, which transfer current to the copper windings using metallic \"brushes\" (instead of induction): \n\n>like your brake pads, the brushes and commutator generate dust and wear out, requiring periodic replacement, which are some of the reasons these are not currently used in any modern EVs or hybrids.  \n>  \n>....  \n>  \n>We asked BMW about the life expectancy of those brushes and commutators, and what happens to the dust as they wear. While they couldn't give us a lifetime estimate for the brushes, they did reassure us that the brush modules are \"in an enclosed and sealed compartment, eliminating dust contamination inside the stator/rotor wiring.\" Anyone who has worked with brakes or even brushed DC motors knows just how fine those dust particles are.

There’s no crash coming, markets have already corrected and as usual you’re all fucking broke.\n\nFor those of you who didn’t know there’s TWO WAYS THE MARKET CAN CORRECT.

Lots down 50%, tech down 10%. Secondly if you haven’t noticed which you probably haven’t, SPX (SP 500) has gone absolutely nowhere since November. For 3 months we’ve gone no where. THIS IS A CORRECTION IN TIME. The 20sma on the weekly chart that has held as support on the weekly chart has held since March 2020 and it CONTINUES TO HOLD. We are in a bull trend plain and simple. To all the bears out there. No crash this time. I hope you bought the dip because we’re about to resume the bull trend and SPX will hit 5000 in the next couple months.\n\nMost people are very bearish and think a huge crash is coming. And are planning on buying the dip. Let me tell you what will happen. We’re about to bounce and have a V shaped recovery. All the money which was waiting to buy the crash is going to jump in and create a fomo rally. This will drive prices higher and create new ATHs.\n\nStop buying into the doom and gloom and buy on support before you fomo and lose all your money at the top.\n\nPositions: Sold 90 SPX ITM credit spreads 4735/4730 01/21/2022", "id": "s5wqab", "created_utc": 1642399572.0, "score": 35, "upvote_ratio": 0.58, "num_comments": 103, "comments": [{"body": "Man you’re fired up, huh?", "score": 64, "replies": [{"body": "Nah.

They have grown revenue by 10%+ in each of the last 4 quarters.  They have also improved their gross margin.  $1.7B in earnings in 2017.  $4.2B in 2020.  They dominate the ecommerce segment which shows every sign of continued growth in 2022.  They should hit $10B in earnings by 2025.\n\nSo your 38 earnings multiple goes under 20 in \\~3 years.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I’m not looking at PE in a vacuum at all.

In fact, I specifically stated those stocks tanking is dependent on missed Earnings or reduced Guidance.  I even said it may not be this quarter or next, and that it all depends on what happens to earnings and the impact reduced liquidity has on them.  \n\nThe point is not that a correction absolutely has to happen right now from PE levels alone.  The point is that collectively they are telling us there is extraordinary systematic risk here if liquidity dries up.  \n\nIts very unlikely the broad big cap techs all keep making Earnings when the Fed tightens policy.  If a drop happens, the drop is unlikely to be a time correction or minor adjustment.  The market has had a lot of Fed support to get to these levels.

Stocks like ZM, PTON, TDOC, NET are all down 60-70% or more.  These are the most speculative names because they were being priced as if perpetual 50%+ revenue growth will extend for a decade plus.  Further, names like PTON and ZM have growing competition and their long-term dominance in their fields is uncertain.\n\nThe tech stocks that have fared better are names like NVDA, GOOG, AAPL, AMD, NFLX, etc.  These names are absolutely dominant in their fields.  They have massive moats and will outgrow the S&P500 in almost any environment.  \n\nIf the speculative tech stocks like ZM keep falling, you'll barely notice it on indexes.  They're much smaller than they were even a few months back.  Their valuation has less of a floor because they still trade on long-term growth potential vs. current financials.  So market sentiment plays a big role in their valuation.\n\nEither way, if these names like ZM and PTON keep on dropping, you should seriously consider bargain hunting.  Another big leg down will put the risk/reward of a long position heavily in favor of the long.  They're already trading below their values in 2018/19 in a lot of circumstances, despite huge tailwinds from WFH transformation which is here to stay.\n\nIMO, the market is full of these mini-bubbles which get destroyed constantly.  The market as a whole marches on.  Just look at SPAC's in 2020 and crypto in 2018.  Small/mid cap tech in 2021/22.

{"title": "The \"WSB Friendly\" Ape DD mentality DD pt. 2 (The bears are coming)", "selftext": "**(DISCLAIMER: I've had trouble posting this all day so Im leaving out the links here, if you would like to see the links, go to my page for the unedited version).**\n\nHey everyone, oickles here! You may have known me for my Ape mentality DD post a while back. I wanted to give you a quick update on what's been going on since I've written that post and even further analysis on why I think Apes are fukt.\n\n\n#The Breaking Point\n\n\nApes have been reaching breaking points as their beloved stock crumbles before their very eyes. One notable instance is going on with the AMC community where, their [stock-tubers are getting suicidal DMs from apes who threw in entire life savings into the stock hoping for a Moass.(I had to remove the link due to the mod removing it)\n  This isn't a game, people are really reaching their breaking point with meme stocks, what you may see in the next 2 weeks may be huge selloffs. People are throwing everything they have to keep the stock propped up [see here](https://imgur.com/gallery/6PUWI9w).\n\n\nThis concludes that apes and retail in general is running out of ammo. The free money from the stimulus has ran out, life savings, any free money that was for benefits even has ran out and they are truly fukt. Apes have cornered themselves in a fortress of shit and are flinging it also at each other while convincing themselves that RC or DFV will come from the heavens and save them. The stocks cannot keep up it's inflated price and the stock will continue to tumble; it's inevitable and a reality for most apes as they watch their life savings go down the drain.\n\n\n#Gamestop\n\n\nGamecock has been the front-runner for most stock investors, its wild volatile swings have been astounding for swing traders. Recently SS had deleted a user's post for making 6 Million dollars from swing trading the stock stating; \"They didnt want other users to follow his example\". Yeah they want the apes to keep bagholding because that's how you make money? You've been brainwashed into thinking that buying a stock makes you money instead of swing trading it. I'd rather pay 45% taxes on 3 million instead of 30% on 20k. I'm just saying..\n\n\nGamestop as a company is burning cash with no potential room for growth, revenue and a future. [The stock is essentially burning cash from 1.7Bill to 1.5B and dropping](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/retail/nyse-gme/gamestop/news/gamestop-nysegme-has-debt-but-no-earnings-should-you-worry-1). The apes would have you believe that the price doesnt matter, the earnings doesnt matter, nothing matters except the DD and this is how you form a cult. You've been gaslighted into losing your money, your hard earned investments and hopes and dreams over a stock that will probably never return to the ATH you sold them for. \n\n\nGamestop doesnt fit in the NFT marketplace and here's why that bullshit pitch is nothing less than copium. Apes with their short termed memory proposed the NFT dividend to expose naked shorting and start the Moass as to what they believe \"we own the float multiple times and a dividend to count each stock would expose the overshorting of the stock\". This fell apart when there was no dividend announced and the Cult leaders had to come up with another tangible lie to keep the Ape's invested. All of a sudden GME is a \"Fundamentals play\" when all before \"Fundamentals don't matter\", \"it's a squeeze play\". I personally asked Gamers how they felt about NFTs and they responded VERY NEGATIVELY \n\nGamestop investors are trying so hard to preach and push NFTs when:\n\n1. NOONE WANTS IT, OUTSIDE OF THE SHITFLINGING APES.\n\n2. NO Developer who would issue an NFT, would ever lose potential profits to a brick and mortar store when they could sell it directly out of their own stores. \n\nThe reason why GME is failing and so hated amoung developers is because, they resell used games and do not pay the companies of the games they resell. [Most of, if not all of the profits goes towards GME and this causes alot of lost revenue.](https://youtu.be/703cX_edBlk). You coukd say that game skins from Call of Duty are NFTs, but noone is going to GameStop to buy COD skins. You can buy the skins straight from Sony store, then buy Cod points and get the skin.\n\n\nEverything is becoming mainstream, NFTs doesn't fit GameStop's narrative and if anything accelerated it's death. You can buy a ps5 from Sony and Amazon or UPS will deliver it, noone needs Gamestop anymore and it's earnings report proves it. Losing 500 Million dollars while increasing in 300 Mill in inventory is not bullish. It means less people are buying and they cannot sell the products they have to compensate. \n\n#FUD, Shills, Bears?\n\nAnything negative about gamestop gets downvoted and noted as \"Paid Shill, Bot and FUD\", so here's what I'm going to do for the apes. Im going to list out some cult signs and debunk some theories about this \"paid shills\".\n\nSigns of a cult:\n\n1. The leader is the ultimate authority (DFV, AA, RC, DD grifters)\n\n\n \"If you’re not allowed to criticize your leader, even if the criticism is true, you’re probably in a cult.\nCults begin with a charismatic leader who claims some supreme knowledge. They may call themselves a prophet, messiah, messenger, or an enlightened teacher. They can also be CEOs, military officials, politicians, and self-help gurus.\"\n\n2. The group suppresses skepticism (FUD, Shill, Bot)\n\n\n If you’re only allowed to study your organization through approved sources, you’re probably in a cult.\nCults view critical thinking as an infectious disease and every effort is made to suppress it. Doubting members are encouraged to isolate themselves from outside influences and focus solely on the doctrine of the cult.\n\n\n3. The group delegitimizes former members (If you leave, you're a paperhanded bitch)\n\nIf you can’t think of a legitimate reason for leaving your group, you’re probably in a cult.\nBecause the cult considers itself the ultimate authority on truth, it can’t imagine anybody leaving it with their integrity intact. Thus, it has to perpetuate a false narrative that former members were deceived, proud, immoral, or lazy.\n\n4.The group is paranoid about the outside world (Everyone is in on it. Amazon, SEC, DTCC, Citadel, CIA, FBI)\n\nIf your group insists the end of the world is near, you’re probably in a cult.\nCults position themselves as the sole refuge from an evil outside world that is intent on their destruction. Cults thrive on conspiracy theories, catastrophic thinking, and persecution complexes.\n\n\n5.The group relies on shame cycles (As shown in one of my pictures, the apes need support because noone believes them)\n\nIf you need your group in order to feel worthy, loved, or sufficient, you’re probably in a cult.\nCult leaders trap members in shame cycles by imposing abnormally strict codes of conduct (usually prescriptions about diet, appearance, sex, relationships, media), guilting members for their shortcomings, and then positioning themselves as the unique remedy to the feelings of guilt which they themselves created\n\nI'm going to stop here and post the source of my information: https://medium.com/@zelphontheshelf/10-signs-youre-probably-in-a-cult-1921eb5a3857\n\nFeel free to give it a read.\n\n#Earnings and how to gauge them\n\nGamestop Q4 earnings are good however; we can compare them by a year by year analysis to see what direction the business is headed in: [Here](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GME/gamestop/revenue)\n\nEven with the Ape and stock boost, Gamestop is still a failing company that DFV fairly valued at 20-40 dollars. He never cited a Moass and this is what caused the downfall of most apes.\n\nIt's honestly a shame to see this, you guys could've been a market terror causing short squeezes all over and getting rich. You instead got yourselves and everyone else involved with your Moass propaganda and Everyone can see through your shit. (link removed)\n\nThat being said, the stock will continue to tumble even with the small rips it will have. Call it a bear flag if you must, but this stock is going to 20 fast and once Apes wake up and realize they have been duped, I could honestly see [terrorist acts](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/s4pswk/at_least_they_get_nfts/) being attempted on DD writers and RC for not delivering the promised Moass.\n\nApes, get out and get some help, reconnect with your loved ones and admit you have a issue. You can rebuild what you've lost, do not wait until it's all gone to try because this will happen [to you](https://www.joshuakennon.com/gt-advanced-technologies-bankruptcy/)\n\nEdit: You can see users like Bigstonkguy that are making a killing from shorting. Shorts are not fucked, Apes are. I believe that Gamestop will see double digitals before a Grand Scale Meltdown.", "id": "s6h41e", "created_utc": 1642459090.0, "score": 25, "upvote_ratio": 0.56, "num_comments": 182, "comments": [{"body": "Fortunately or unfortunately, there's some truth in this post.
