What contract would make the most sense?\n\nEntire books are written on that topic, so it's not something that can be answered briefly in a Reddit post. This TL;DR is the best I can do, but understand that about 99% of the details have been left out, and some of those details are critically important. This is also only one of dozens of ways to do a bullish trade on BBIG.\n\n* Make or find a forecast, like BBIG will sustain a rising trend for the next 3 months, or BBIG will hit $5 by mid year, or BBIG will take a dump and lose 50% by end of quarter, or BBIG will be acquired by PLAY for a $.75 premium, etc. The essential parts of a forecast are a timeline and a price change/direction.\n\n* Pick a date that covers the timeline. Add 30 days of padding, so if \"hit $5 by mid year\" means June, shoot for July. If that date is more than 60 days to expiration, just pick 60 or the monthly expiration that is closest to 60 days.\n\n* Decide if you are more interested in $ gain/loss or % gain/loss (aka leverage) on an option trade.\n\n* If you want $ gain/loss, find the highest delta strike that you can afford to lose. So if 70 delta costs $1, 80 delta costs $2, and 90 delta costs $3, and you don't want to lose more than $150, choose the 70 delta strike.\n\n* If you want % gain/loss, choose a strike between 25 to 50 delta, with the understanding that the lower the delta is the cheaper the call will be, but your probability of profit will be correspondingly lower. A 50 delta call that costs $.40 has roughly a 50% chance of being ITM by expiration, while a 25 delta that costs $.11 only has a 25% chance of being ITM by expiration.\n\nThis says nothing about [exit strategy](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/pages/mondayschool/yourplan), which in many ways is more important than contract selection, but like I said, 99% of details omitted.\n\nSee the resources linked at this top of this page for more in-depth dives into the details.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I’m a newbie with several weeks learning options, if you’re a beginner the best source I have found is videos by Tony Zhang at OptionsPlay, i have no association with him.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Always interested in good sites or channels to add to our recommended list.

It is nearly impossible to make the stop and the assignment happen at the same time. Even if you only try this at 0 DTE, the stop will always happen before the assignment (after market close), at likely different prices. And of course the days you don't have an expiration, you won't have an assigned put.\n\nFirst, you have to ensure you bought the shares for a cost basis below the strike price. Like if you bought for $80, the stock goes up to $110 and you write the put at $100 and a stop-limit at $100. The stock falls to $99.99 and your stop is triggered. Later, the stock falls to $90 and the put gets assigned and you buy 100 shares for $100/share.\n\nNet gain/loss on original 100 shares: $99.99 - $80 = $19.99/share (though you have an opportunity cost of $110 - $99.99 = $10.01/share).\n\nNet gain/loss on assigned put: $90 - $100 + credit, though the $10/share loss is unrealized and won't be realized until you dump the new lot of 100 shares.\n\nThat's the happy case where everything goes right.

Timing a decline is the same knife catching problem.\n\n> Does buying an ATM (or slightly OTM) LEAPS put make sense?\n\nYou already know the answer is no. It's a numbers game. If you buy too soon, you expire before the decline. If you buy too late, you miss the decline. If you cast a wide net and buy a put 2 years out, you get to watch your value melt away to delta and theta. Over a long period of time like 2 years, most ETFs will have a lot more up days than down days, by like 50 to 1. And most of the down days won't help you anyway, because if something cumulatively went up $10 over the last few months, a $3 decline at that point doesn't turn your loss into a profit. If you try to fix the theta problem by going deep ITM, you lose more to delta.\n\n\n> Or does it make the most sense to set up a bearish-biased straddle, probably with a much sooner expiration?\n\nNo, because take all the problems listed above and multiply by 2, because now you have two legs that can lose money to delta and theta. One leg is always losing to delta in a straddle, so you are basically guaranteeing that you have some kind of loss.\n\n------------------------\n\nIf you really want to catch a falling knife, here is the least worst way to do it. It's not a good way, it just is less bad than all the others. Actually, I'll give you two ways.\n\n1. Roll short holding time far OTM call credit spreads\n\n1. Roll long puts whose total cost is less than your break-even expected value\n\nRolling call credit spreads is self-explanatory. You might as well make theta work for you instead of against you. Keeping your holding time short mitigates delta risk. Like open 45 DTE to a monthly expiration and then roll at 15 DTE to the next 45 DTE monthly expiration. You are only exposed to delta risk in 30 day intervals. If the decline should happen in the middle of one of those 30 days, you get close to max credit by closing early. \n\nAdvantage of this approach is that if you are far enough OTM, even 30 consecutive up days might still pay off in a profit. Downside of this approach is your upside on a decline is capped at the credit for the spread.\n\nRolling long puts is a little more complicated. Let's assume you will hold 12 long puts over the course of a year, rolling every 30 days to adjust for delta (perhaps open at 60 DTE and roll to 60 DTE at 30 DTE). Most of those rolls will be for a loss. Estimate the total cost of all the puts and the cumulative loss. Assume the decline will happen in one of those 30 day holds.\n\nThat gives you everything you need to estimate your [expected value](http://www.selectoptions.com/Edu-Expected-Result) on the series of trades:\n\nWin % = 1 out of number of months you run this strategy. For example, lets say 24 months, so 1 in 24 is 4%.\n\nWin $ = Estimate of how much you will make on a winning put. Let's say this is $10,000.\n\nLoss $ = The cost of the initial put plus the sum of all the gain/losses on the rolls, which will probably all be losses. Let's say this is $3000.\n\nRun the formula. If your ev comes out negative or zero, adjust the above values until it becomes positive. Maybe buy cheaper puts or maybe put a cap on the cost of rolling.\n\nUsing the example numbers above:\n\nEV = (.04 x 10000) - (.96 x 3000) = 400 - 2880 = -2480\n\nSurprise, surprise, ev is negative so this trading scheme is a net loser. Assuming win % is constant and can't be improved, you either need to figure out a way to win more or lose less.\n\nNOTE: The loss $ amount of 3000 is overstated, since an early win, like in month 1 or month 2 means you don't roll puts after the decline, so you save those losses. To get a more accurate EV, you want to figure out some average loss where the probability of stopping the roll of puts is equal from month to month.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "An effective approach is to assume your prediction will be wrong.  \n\nThis leads to minimizing the cost of the position, and seeking positions that do not consume the account value while waiting for the expected event.  \n\nOthers have described the difficulty of identifying a suitable perspective, given trends upward, and sideways, and drops in price less than longer term trends upward.  \n\nA trade that some take on is a variety of a ratio back spread.  \nThis position can be set up to cost little, or for a small net credit, so that on upward moves, there is no loss, and by exiting early the trader can have limited losses on modest moves down, yet can pay off well on your predicted **major** move down.  \n\nThe position is best entered and maintained in a low implied volatility regime.

You can set up a spread that has a high probability of yielding that return, but you can't lock in a return like that for 100% certainty until expiration, and even then it's not 100% certain due to the time delay between the close of the option market and the cutoff for exercise.\n\nWhat makes it impossible is that the price movement of any single contract is not predictable before expiration, since the price movement of the underlying is also not predictable. When you have to predict the price movement of **two** contracts so that they perfectly net out to $5000 for a 50 point move is, like I said, impossible.\n\nWhat you can do is use a pricing model calcuatlor/visualizer to forecast the probability of reaching that return, and then tweak the input parameters like the strikes, premiums or expirations, to fill the chart with as many $5000 and more returns points as possible.\n\nThese are two popular calculators/visualizers, with the rest in the final link below:\n\nhttps://optionstrat.com/\n\nhttps://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/calculator/call-spread.html\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/toolbox/links#wiki_calculators_and_visualizers", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you for your reply.

There are several ways this can happen:\n\n* Call is ITM after 4pm on expiration day (but see note below)\n\n* Call is so deep ITM that it's extrinsic value is a rounding error. The call holder loses almost nothing by exercising early and saves on opportunity cost, so is likely to exercise early.\n\n* Exercising the call would allow the exerciser to receive a dividend that is substantially larger than the extrinsic value they would lose by exercising.\n\nNote: One exception is even if the extrinsic value is zero, if the result of exercise would put the exerciser in a position to spend more on the shares than they would have to in the open market, they may not exercise. For example, if you sold a $100 strike call and the stock was $101 at 4pm on expiration you'd expect to be assigned, but at 4:30pm bad news was announced that caused the stock to fall to $69 in after hours trading. In such a situation a holder of a call may not want to spend $100/share on something that is looking like it's only going to be worth $69/share or less on Monday. They have until 5:30pm on expiration day to decide (earlier if their broker has an earlier cutoff time).\n\n> If the stock price exceeds the strike price say $14, and its on or before the day of expiration, can we buy to close the calls back at a loss to prevent it from being exercised by the end of day?\n\nCan you?

At 8:32 AM today, I had placed and filled 5 Call Debit Spreads on SPY @0.50 each ($250 total). Now to get some things straight, I had lost on my previous trade due to my stop loss triggering at -70%, and figured my first lunar trade was a bust, however, before the phase change my contracts were actually in the money a few days later. For accurate research purposes I am now keeping a log of trades that lose simply becauase of a stop loss trigger, and a log for trades that win on expiry. Anyways, the summary of this trading strategy is that the moon and the markets synchronize, and I am here to put my money where my mouth is to prove it, or unfortunately for my wallet, disprove it. I have made some alterations to my strategy to allow for a range of days before and after phase changes to avoid situations where I am one day off from absolute success, this comes with increased costs to trade since further expiry options are more expensive, but it naturally makes my bets a little safer. Backtesting, I have found that a majority of dips and rallies are not on the exact day of a lunar phase change, and most happen between phases changes, during the waxing/waning periods.\n\nCurrently, we are halfway through the 'Waxing Gibbous' phase and have already expierienced a pretty large dip with SPY.

So, don't discount the possibility that if lunar phases seem influential to you, perhaps what's being influenced is your mind's perceptiveness in sifting all of the relevant factors.

You didn't make money in this instance because you didn't allow enough time.  That can be a function of stop loss or the expiration you chose in the first place.  Had you chosen Feb 18 expiration, for example, you would have made money.  So, perhaps it's too much to ask of the fledgling model that it give you both the direction of the move and the stop-on-a-dime optimal expiration date.  Maybe you can let out some line, so to speak, by allowing the bet to run longer (either in the initial purchase you allow 45 days or by rolling the trade if it's moved against you but you still believe the prophecy).\n\nAnyway, this system is as good as anybody else's gambling system.

{"title": "Goldman predicts the Fed will hike rates four times this year, more than previously expected", "selftext": "Persistently high inflation combined with a labor market near full employment will push the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates more than expected this year, according to the latest forecast from Goldman Sachs. The Wall Street firm’s chief economist, Jan Hatzius, said in a note Sunday that he now figures the Fed to enact four quarter-percentage point rate hikes in 2022, representing an even more aggressive path than the central bank’s indications of just a month ago. The Fed’s benchmark overnight borrowing rate is currently anchored in a range between 0%-0.25%, most recently around 0.08%. “Declining labor market slack has made Fed officials more sensitive to upside inflation risks and less sensitive to downside growth risks,” Hatzius wrote. “We continue to see hikes in March, June, and September, and have now added a hike in December for a total of four in 2022.”\n\nGoldman had previously forecast three hikes, in line with the level Fed officials had penciled in following their December meeting. The firm’s outlook for a more hawkish Fed comes just a few days ahead of key inflation readings this week that are expected to show prices rising at their fastest pace in nearly 40 years. If the Dow Jones estimate of 7.1% year-over-year consumer price index growth in December is correct, that would be the sharpest gain since June 1982. That figure is due out Wednesday. At the same time, Hatzius and other economists do not expect the Fed to be deterred by declining job growth. Nonfarm payrolls rose by 199,000 in December, well below the 422,000 estimate and the second month in a row of a report that was well below consensus. However, the unemployment rate fell to 3.9% at a time when employment openings far exceed those looking for work, reflecting a rapidly tightening jobs market.\n\nHatzius thinks those converging factors will cause the Fed not only to raise rates a full percentage point, or 100 basis points, this year but also to start shrinking the size of its $8.8 trillion balance sheet. He pointed specifically to a statement last week from San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, who said she could see the Fed starting to shed some assets after the first or second hike. “We are therefore pulling forward our runoff forecast from December to July, with risks tilted to the even earlier side,” Hatzius wrote. “With inflation probably still far above target at that point, we no longer think that the start to runoff will substitute for a quarterly rate hike.” Goldman’s forecast is in line with market pricing, which sees a nearly 80% chance of the first pandemic-era rate hike coming in March and close to a 50-50 probability of a fourth increase by December, according to the CME’s FedWatch Tool. \n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/10/goldman-predicts-the-fed-while-hike-rates-four-times-this-year-more-than-previously-expected.html", "id": "s0m51f", "created_utc": 1641827318.0, "score": 659, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 165, "comments": [{"body": "Haven't all their public predictions been anti signals for the think they warn about?", "score": 29, "replies": [{"body": "if you want to make money do exactly the opposite Goldman Sacks says you should do.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Actually no you don't.

They also didn't want to tighten too early and risk a new wave of COVID sending the economy back into recession. Given there is never a perfect time to tighten and the we're still dealing with COVID I think they probably decided to air on the side of caution and to be a little late if anything.\n\nHowever, they now no longer seem believe inflation is transitory and now that the economic dangers of COVID appear to be mostly over (at least in the US) they've decided it's time to tighten.\n\nThere are other thoughts though. Some think the FED acted late to please the democrats. Others have even more conspiratorial views about the motivations of the FED. At the end of the day whatever the FED does someone wins and someone loses and that tends to make any decisions they make extremely polarising. If you go back to 2020 many people here were extremely angry about how quickly and aggressively the FED acted when the market started to tank because they were expecting more weakness. Others outside of investment communities were worried the FED was creating an asset bubble and that inflation would financially hurt the average American. I honestly don't remember a time in the last decade when the FED received broad praise for their policy decisions.

It makes sense in a way — most people who want electric cars don’t want a Ford or GM truck, and most people who want a Ford or GM truck don’t want an EV.\n\nHere is the real issue.\n\nAll of the profit, equipment, staffing, patents, etc. come from internal combustion engine development.  The plants and businesses are set up to build so many million per year.  If they build half as much, they don't make \"half the profit\" they more likely lose money in a MULTIPLE of the profit they used to make.  Idle labor and equipment is an expensive sonofabitch.\n\nSo the REAL trick for Ford and GM and the like is to make enough EVs, quickly enough, and profitably enough, to not just survive the massive coming losses on stranded ICE assets, dodge labor disputes as unions get PISSED that Ford and GM are firing Engine designers and oil pumps and etc. left and right.  They need to make profits doing the new stuff even with the old stuff weighing them down.\n\nTo make matters worse, they are \"value\" stocks, so the primary investors count on their dividends and continued, consistent profitability.  If those go away, many of their investors go away, putting downward pressure on their stock, making it harder to raise money through equity offerings.\n\nTo make things STILL worse, all those stranded ICE assets and collateralized leases and such mean MASSIVE piles of debt.  Like, 10 years of revenue, ignoring profit and loss to pay it off kind of debt.\n\nSo, they have to get good enough at a new tech, very fast, and while learning how to build it, but still make so much profit on it that while it's still a supply constrained supplier environment, they can handle the debt obligations, keep their investors on board, keep the unions happy enough while the total work force size declines, keep their DEALERS happy with lower maintenance vehicles, when dealers make the majority of THEIR profit on maintenance not sales, and overcome the decreasing demand for ICE vehicles, both real and regulation forced, all at the same time.\n\nThey must do this while being behind on battery supply, battery cost, iterations of EV tech, installed charging infrastructure, semi conductors and market positioning to brands like Tesla.\n\nI wish them the best of luck.

I'd argue that retaining market share has always been the most important rather than pure growth in this industry. Growing market share is always obviously what you want, but it is difficult to do in a mature industry with long product life cycles and no overwhelming differentiation between companies. That's also why car companies focus branding on emotions and lifestyles. When is the last time you saw an add that purely shows the feature of the car, rather than it cruising along a country road or over some rough terrain talking in abstract about America or freedom or the like? So I don't think cannibalization is really a huge concern as long as it leads to market share retention. \n\n>Ford and GM are at a large disadvantage with all the baggage of a century of producing ICE vehicles. It's way easier to build an electric car company from scratch (like Nio) rather than trying to transition an ICE company into an EV company.  \n\nThis has its drawbacks, but also provides opportunities. Again, it's an investment that will need to be made but it's definitely easier to retool current manufacturing facilities for EV than it is to build one from scratch. In addition to that, legacy automakers have the know-how that will allow them to provide better quality control relative to upstarts. Tesla has been criticized in the last few years for it's bad quality control and design flaws, particularly for relative to the cost of some of its vehicles. At this point in time, Tesla is more of a statement piece as a vehicle, so design flaws and quality control aren't as big of a factor. But as they reach mass adoption, those issues are going to rise to the forefront and hold them back. I'm not talking battery tech here, that is a separate issue, but small things like leaks, off center panels, bumpers falling off, bad paint jobs, etc. You won't get those kind of issues with a bonafide automaker. As long as Tesla's powertrain and battery tech is the best they are lesser issues, but if Ford/GM catch up those issue now become front and center.\n\nI don't think Cathie can make the argument that Ford and GM are ridiculous without conceding that Tesla's value is multiple times worse than that.

The fact is, auto stocks were driven down to low valuations precisely because they had not seen meaningful growth in years. In other words, they turned into value stocks. You bought Ford because it was essentially a financial company with some verticality. In essence, they make may not make much from cars because the markets are diluted, but they double end it with financing. This is where people get it wrong about F. Their debt is mostly financing cars. They make a profit from that.\n\nBut back to the macro argument. What is the advantage of an eV? The answer is low cost, not just to consumers, but also cheaper and easier to make and maintain. Margins are about to skyrocket for the 1st time in decades. And they are likely to stick there for about a decade more before battery tech starts to coalesce and saturation happens. So in other words, margins will stay high a long time as tech pushes forward. Dont be surprised if an average eV has over 500mi range and an extended range well into 800+ miles in about a decade. And best of all, the batteries will be half the current price. So prices will fall but so will cost thus keeping interest high along with margins.\n\nI give it 3-4 years for Ford before their margins make a huge jump (as they scale), and about 5-6 years for GM \\*\\*IF\\*\\* they dont screw up (less faith in their ability to make a good car). And you need to understand what this means for these behemoths. For guys like F or GM, a single percentage point of margin is HUGE. Their volume is so big that if they can improve just 5% it would nearly double their earnings. eV's, in theory should eventually have margins of 15-25% once batteries are scaled and tech becomes ubiquitous. In the long run it will be back to old thin levels but thats probably 15-20 years away because battery tech is in its infancy.\n\nHere is another reality check for Coaster Cathy.\n\nTesla is actually going to start bleeding market. Why? Because once competition is here, people will no longer settle for low reliability. Tesla is the least reliable car on the road. They go down a lot due to all the nonsensical toys they add in (self driving, gaming on the console (lol), dancing cars, popout door handles, etc). Parts are expensive and they take long to repair. These kind of things matter once there is competition. Peoples standards will go way up and Tesla will need to address it. Will they succeed? No idea. We will see. But thats the next growing pain. The big guys already have these networks in place. They have different problems to worry about.\n\nSo in other words, the legacy guys are indeed about to enter a growth phase.

Shit on a stock without giving reason like other politics subs. It’s a terrible look for r/stocks. I’d like to debate this properly, but if you scroll down this comment section it’s just variations of lol cathie sucks, she’s a clown, or this and this stock sucks, and various other snarky comments, that’s my main issue, and the echo chamber of course.\n\nAnyway here’s what my research says:\n\n1) it doesn’t have a moat that’s true, but long term the healthcare industry is looking to integrate telehealth services into a hybrid model with in-office care, which will be integral to reducing healthcare costs while still giving quality care. Despite the rapid increase in vaccinations and restrictions compared to 2020, there was a record number of telehealth visits last quarter - 3 million, so it doesn’t seem like telehealth is slowing down.\n\n2) Tdoc’s userbase and revenue has increased every year, the 800 million dollar loss is a bit disingenuous because they also bought their biggest competitor for 18.5 billion dollars. There’s also data on this - patient visits grew 40% compared to 2020 during the height of the pandemic (valueline). So I’d argue top line growth has exceeded expectations but bottom line hasn’t caught up to it, I think this is temporary because it’s in a hyper growth phase, and it has expanded A LOT outside of the livongo acquisition, including product launches like primary360. They’re partnering with CVS to provide primary360 to patients.\n\nHaving said that based on top line growth, it’s definitely still a speculative stock because it hasn’t translated into profits yet, I’m not going to dispute that.\n\nHowever I should say there’s likely to be continued growth after the pandemic because livongo has given them access to a 50 billion dollar market of remote patient monitoring for chronic illnesses, especially diabetes and hypertension, which requires long term monitoring and can get very expensive with each doctor’s visit - my mom is using livongo for this reason.(source: the numbers are pulled from the latest Morningstar and valueline report on tdoc - they’re currently giving it a 5 star buy rating).\n\n3) chronic illness management, referrals, medication refills, therapy (big one right now - every one of my therapist friends are working remotely), are all better served using telemedicine instead of waiting at an office just to be told you are fine. Given how much a doctor’s visit cost, this is a good thing for both patients and healthcare providers.\n\nAgain, I appreciate the input, because it only helps when someone counters a bullish or bearish thesis with a nuanced argument unlike 99% of the people in here, so I really do want to hear it.

I have over 5k shares so when the stock price is around 3000 I’ll be comfortable to retire off it and sustain the lifestyle I want putting up 1-2 million in selling covered calls(I would have about 15 million). Therefore I would never having to selling shares from my main position(unless margin called? I hope not). You can extrapolate from what I’m saying. Basically less than a 10% margin position in my options plan makes sense to me for a nice passive income. But I am still learning and looking at all ideas in formulating my plan. I still do not own any real estate because comparatively selling a covered call has a higher return on capital than a real estate asset, in my opinion. A good example is my current rental I just upgraded to is worth 2 million, yet I rent it for Pennies on the dollar compared to what 2 million in covered calls could get me today. It’s only “risk free” if you manage risk well and don’t get to greedy and emotional on a downturn. I have already endured three 40% drops of my NW. I’m a long term investor in TSLA for the foreseeable future. I do aim for 5% margin use for more shares. I’m a little loaded up and won’t be increasing more shares for a little bit. My maintain 5% margin usage is me allocating capital at 1% IBKR rates better than the debt. It’s been very lucrative so far also and I started that around 800-900 pre split with my first 5% balance.

They need to give up on their ICE manufacturing business as soon as possible and put all new development in to EVs. But that seems like a very difficult transition to navigate. There was a period where car sales were pretty profitable, and a lot of these existing companies grew and got established during that time, and it paid for a lot of infrastructure. A lot of the assets that are being used to make cars now was probably full depreciated decades ago.

It's actually great for them initially, they get to sell a better car to the same customers, probably at a higher price. Their margins on EVs will probably depend on how many people they can convince to buy the higher trim levels, but I expect demand for all EVs to be well higher than supply for awhile, so there's probably going to be people will to pay above market to just avoid the waiting list.\n\nBut over medium term it could be a bloodbath. Most customers aren't going to buy an EV and then switch back to a petrol car. So EV production is going to have to go up substantially every year to capture those customers, and that's going to be limited by battery supply. Anyone who's not investing heavily in significant battery production now is going to be in real trouble in a few years when every auto company is going to want to be making millions of EVs, and there's not the battery supply to support them all.
