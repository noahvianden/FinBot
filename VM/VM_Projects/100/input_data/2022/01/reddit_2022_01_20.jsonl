They slowed their spending during the pandemic, and they had decent FCF, but their net adds were anemic.  Now they’ve re-upped content spending to near 0 FCF, and they’re yet again struggling to add subs. \n\nThey didn’t lose money on a GAAP basis, but if this is the content spending level they need just to maintain their current user base, the content amortization will catch up in 1-2 years, and their earnings would stagnate or contract. \n\nThey had $5B in GAAP net income this year, but all of $400M OCF.

They are already in a lot more countries that HBO which is still beholden to old licensing deals with legacy cable companies in places like the UK and Australia. \n\n\nIMO Netflix needs a big pivot in their production strategy. When they broke into the streaming game their product was seen as a better cheaper alternative to Cable. This was true mostly because the cable companies hadn’t realized the full value of their existing IP. They saw Netflix as just as another form of syndication. Netflix actually anticipated the cable companies next move quite well, they understood that they would eventually pull their best IP (or raise the licensing price significantly, $500 million for *Seinfeld*) and they went hard developing their own IP or acquiring distribution rights. \n\nBut the mistake they made IMO, is that they created their content with the idea of attracting cord cutters not making the best content. So they went in hard on replicating the variety of a cable subscription, reality shows, cooking shows, travel shows, teen shows, action, comedies, fantasy, sci fi.

So if you buy 100$ worth of it today you will get 100+3.12 by end of 6 months form now. Then based on inflation stats, gov would have announced a new rate in may 22 which would be applied for your last 6 months of the year. There is a site which is tracking this inflation stats from gov for nov, december.. to figure out whta it could be in may [https://tipswatch.com/2022/01/12/u-s-inflation-surged-7-0-in-2021-the-highest-rate-in-40-years/](https://tipswatch.com/2022/01/12/u-s-inflation-surged-7-0-in-2021-the-highest-rate-in-40-years/)\n\nSo it could be another 3.5% annual = 1.7% for last 6 months. \n\nWhich means over the 1st year period, you could make about 5$ on a 100$ i bond investment. This all depends on what the rate will be in may 22. \n\nAlso understand that you need to hold ibond for minimum of 1 year and then if you sell it back to the us gov between 1 and 5 years, you lose last 3 months of interest. Which is still not bad considering your bank is prob giving you a big ol 0 in interest right now. \n\nLastly, why is it way less risky then stocks? mostly because you are literally giving US your own money to borrow. And US is giving you the inflation rate equivalent interest on this. \n\nYou can buy 10000$ worth of it every calendar year from the treasury direct website only. you need to be residing in USofA to be eligible and have an SSN. \n\nSo based on above, ibonds is not a good emergency fund if its your only emergency fund for the first year(Since you wont be able to sell it untill first year end). \n\nIts a great place to keep your emergency fund if you have held it for more than 1 year. Since in this case you can sell it and get cahs back in your bank acct within coupls of business days. \n\nLastly, I feel this is a great place to keep cash that you might need in 2-3 years (like for buying a house or another big purchase etc) and make some interst on it. \n\nIbond rates are dependent on inflation rate and a fixed rate. Fixed rate has been 0, so the 5% you are getting now is purely because of inflation and this is the component because of which the over all rate changes every 6 months.

Don't look at the ETH chart and wonder where all the hashrate comes from, it surely is all from ASICs and AMD GPUs, ye totally that is where it is from! \n\nDo yourself a favor. Go look up ETH hashrate for 2021, calculate how many cards that is. Then compare that growth rate with Nvidia revenue numbers. Then do the same for 2018 H1 (as in the actual year, not Nvidia financials) and the numbers they posted back then. Sure, some will be from ASICs and AMD, but most will be Ampere and a lesser degree Turing.\n\n\nAnd that is just crypto. The gaming market situation is another point that will not last.

As a result their revenue and profits jumped massively that quarter. Would you base your price target in 10 years on the basis of them continuing to find more lumps of gold? At a ever increasing rate?\n\nThat's what Nvidia has done, they stumbled onto \"a larg chunk of gold\". Exactly how large that chunk is we don't really know, because you can't find it specified on their balance sheets and earnings reports, hell Nvidia themselves probably has no real clear answer.\n\nThe only way that portion of their current growth can continue is if they keep finding more gold (ETH price goes up and doesn't switch to PoS). If it doesn't then they will have some really bad quarters until sales comes down to the level where it's not boosted by selling \"gold\". The pandemic demand is then another factor that just makes this worse, if crypto really crashes instead of just correcting and supply/prices comes down at the same time, run for the hills if you own Nvidia.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": ">Hahaha, are we going to have this conversation again after we saw what happened to Nvidia numbers after the 2018 bubble crashed?

ETH price and as a result mining revenue has to keep growing to increase mining revenue. Mining revenue is then directly translatable to a number of cards needed for mining. Once that number is filled, then no more cards will be bought until more profitable cards arrive. But that will not generate growth, just a constant revenue stream. To have sustained growth from crypto the total mining revenue has to keep increasing.\n\nThat disregards ETH devs wanting to take the coin to PoS, which means GPU mining is dead overnight. There is no other coin that can support the current mining ecosystem.\n\n>All growth stocks are volatile and a risk but saying that NVDA is dependent on crypto to not crash is a gross overstatement. \n\nCurrent vaulation does, if you think otherwise then you are just delusional. If so I wont bother, I tried talking sense into people the last time when Jensen staid crypto had no large impact on their growth in 2018, people simply wont listen in a mania.\n\n>People buying these kinds of cards usually know what they are buying and don't like GPUs that come from mining farms - especially if they could finally buy a GPU at MSRP.\n\nKeep telling yourself that, I'm about as much of a nerd and enthustiast as you can conjure up, and I'm telling you that you are wrong. If you can get \"mining cards\" at half the price of MSRP of equal performance in retail, then plenty of people will jump on the opportunity. Just like they did when the 2014 bubble imploded and the 2018 one.\n\nMining cards being available in the second hand market also causes price pressure on none mining cards.

With that being withdrawn, inflation, QT, and other headwinds, earnings can't be as strong as they have been.

They're not going to gain another $100 anytime soon.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "No question there. The rapid earnings expansion we've seen over past couple of year is almost entirely due to stimulus measures. No one is expecting earnings growth to be as strong this year as it was last year, and this has been priced in given that the market today is trading at a fairly typical multiple given where expected growth and interest rates are.\n\nThe concern would be a 2008 type scenario where earnings growth doesn't just slow, but turns negative. Negative earnings growth is much harder to model because you need to try to guess when growth will pick back up and how low earnings might fall before that happens. In that kind of scenario there's really no limit to how low valuations could go. This could happen if the FED makes a policy error, but there is also some macro economic risk that could potentially derail the economy. There's no reason right now to think this is going to happen.\n\nAs for NFLX, they didn't post a decline in earnings, in fact their earnings came in higher than expectations, the problem for NFLX was that their subscriber growth declined more than expected. And even then it was still growth, just not as strong as it has been. To be honest I'm not sure you can really extrapolate slower Netflix subscriber growth into slowing, or negative earnings growth for the rest of the economy. Perhaps you could argue if the consumer was stronger maybe more people would have signed up, but my guess would be that it has more to do with COVID reopenings and market saturation than the economy.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "I think the part you’re not considering is that the market’s very high earning multiples & valuations have been heretofore justified by “explosive” growth and low interest rates. \n\nWhat happened to Netflix and to a bigger extent DocuSign was that they showed that growth slowing, even by just by a little bit. When that happened, their earnings multiples got crushed, even though they both still beat on earnings. Because their higher multiples could no longer be justified.

The average weighted PE on the S&P500 has come down from 39 to 25.5 in just the last 12 months. A 25.5 PE isn't a high multiple compared to recent history when the 10 year was in a similar place.\n\nAlso when I model the projected growth and the recent rise in the 10 year yield the S&P500 seems to be at about the right level. Perhaps a little high, but it's less than 5% over my price target at this point so within the margin of error. This is assuming a 7% annual earnings growth rate which is a little below the 9% estimate and I'm using 1.8% as the risk free rate which is where the 10 year yield is currently sitting, but it's possible this could go higher. Still, even a move to 2% would only bump down valuations a few percent.\n\n\\> We’re not saying there’s going to be a recession, but we’re entering into an environment where these historically very high multiples can no longer be justified (if only because of rising rates).\n\nWhen you say \"very high multiples\" what are you looking at and what are you comparing to? Multiples are high compared to long-term historical averages, but the metrics most people cite here as evidence of a bubble don't take into account interest rates. When you factor in interest rates you tend to find the market is around the right price.\n\nThat said I do think the market is still a little high and we probably could go lower, especially if the 10 year starts to rise again or tech earnings come in weak... I do agree with you that the prices and valuations we saw a month ago can no longer be justified. If you're just saying we have further to go I think I'd agree, but if you're saying the market is going to go down 10%+ from here, I just don't see how that would be possible unless something very unexpected happens.

Not spacs trade at 7b that bairly cross 100 in revenue or IPOs that never put out a single car to be valued at the 3rd largest car manufacturer..\n\nThe inflation I actually don’t think he was wrong saying it was transitionary, because it was supply driven and not demand. Supply driven that at this rate I feel is greed. In the last few months when it spiked, I started to see dealers add insane mark ups, people see things still selling and do they same. Ship rates go up, COG, real-estate which means cost to store goes up and guess what - end user get the sht end of the stick. If you think half of this is coming back down, your delusional. I mean, only time shipping, greed, etc gets broke is during a recession - so if their plan is to raise rates fast to put us into a recession to fight inflation..\n\nAnother option is Like I said above, inflation measurement is YOY and at this rate we are so high - you will see in the coming months it settle and go down. I see car dealers now selling at msrp, getting inventory in and on business sides I see people saying sales are slowing up. This will help.

The whole point of any investment, is to put some out and then receive small amounts (hopefully increasing) over time. Speculation however, is based on the expectation of the 'greater fool theory'. Considering the asset has no cash flows, the only cash flow can come from selling the asset. \n\nMost 'investors' do not 'invest', they speculate. It is an important distinct to make. Another way of thinking about investing (from Warren Buffett) is that you aren't buying 'shares', but a whole business (and you just happen to own part of it). You wouldn't sell shares in the company if it went up or down on a day. The whole point of you owning this business is to receive dividend income for the next say (60 years). \n\nWhen you get disappointed about the stock price, you should look to the fundamentals of the business. The stock price is just a show. One of the issues with investing these days is that people leverage their lives to stock prices. If a stock goes up 10x then down 10x, after say 2-3 years, a significant portion of these investors will be bankrupt, as it would have only taken 10% margin to wipe you out in these circumstances. Living this way introduces tail risk. \n\nTesla right now makes about $12 per year (assuming a $3 EPS \\*4). If you say own 1,000 shares, you are effectively earning $12,000 per year. That is about 1.2% a year. You can retire when the profit on your shares exceeds your expenditure. Living in this way massively reduces the tail risk as a result of valuation moves. \n\nAll of the FIRE stuff works off the basis of market cap. If the stock market goes down 80%, your income is reduced by the same. A 'hypothetical 100% dividend payment' is much less likely to go down 80%. If a company falls massively, but still is making profits, that will be highly supportive to its valuation. A company like Apple might go down by 50% in a massive correction, but it won't go down 80%. They are just buying back too much stock for it to get that low. Tesla could go down 80%.\n\n**TL;DR Look at and only spend the net income your holdings make. This is your actual 'income'. This is distinct to looking at how much the stock went up in the last X months. This is meaningless.**", "score": 19, "replies": []}, {"body": "Be greedy when others are fearful.\n\nBe greedy when others are greedy. \n\nBe greedy.", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "![gif](giphy|fBM4ruLmB2pZHsgwtQ|downsized)", "score": 8, "replies": []}, {"body": "Yes.

As an example, loss aversion implies that one who loses $100 will feel twice the emotional pain as another person will feel satisfaction from receiving $100. Common indications include checking your portfolio on an almost daily basis, selling funds before you intended to lock in profits, or selling when you didn't intend to in order to avoid further losses.\n\nThis may have evolutionary roots.\n\nHypothesis: A caveman who lost food was likely to suffer starvation or even death.  Loss was often permanent, as stolen food could be eaten by others, or become inedible due to spoilage.  People who had loss aversion characteristics were more likely to survive than those who did not.\n\nBut stocks are not food.\n\nWhen the markets don't want to pay as much $ for a stock, the vast majority of shareholders are not going to starve.   Market valuations will rebound **IF** the business underlying the stock continues to be healthy and growing.\n\n**Stocks are not food, and investors should not treat them as such**.

For VW, Audi and Porsche, this proportion, the exact figures are graciously concealed by the graph, somewhere between 1 and 3 percent.\nThis goes even further into detail to prove Volkswagen's weaknesses.\n\nDevelopment time for a main headlight: 18 months at Tesla, twice as fast as Volkswagen.\n\nPermanent updates and data exchange for Model 3 via the Internet.\n\nDevelopment of the plant in Shanghai, China, in less than three years from construction start to \"global export hub\".\n\nAnd if you thought the Americans were too small to be able to survive against one of the German giants, please convince you of the steep increase in capacity.

I want to see massive losses (or gains sometimes too) and GME until recently just doesn't have that because it's been flat for a year before the SPY selloff.

Coincidentally we are about at that time where it pumps again and the one year anniversary is a week away (which likely means price suppression to keep fomo to a minimum) but HUGE price movement due to failure to delivers in February. The main reason for this would be due to an INSANELY large amount of 5 dollar puts that are obviously just used to fudge failure to deliver numbers and suppress price are expiring on Friday. \n\nEven if you don’t believe in GME, this is a great OG WSB play in terms of a gamble with huge potential for moon with options, I would honestly recommend the Feb 18/March options if that is what you are looking for.
