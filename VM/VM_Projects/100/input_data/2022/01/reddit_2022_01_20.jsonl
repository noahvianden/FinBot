When they broke into the streaming game their product was seen as a better cheaper alternative to Cable. This was true mostly because the cable companies hadn‚Äôt realized the full value of their existing IP. They saw Netflix as just as another form of syndication. Netflix actually anticipated the cable companies next move quite well, they understood that they would eventually pull their best IP (or raise the licensing price significantly, $500 million for *Seinfeld*) and they went hard developing their own IP or acquiring distribution rights. \n\nBut the mistake they made IMO, is that they created their content with the idea of attracting cord cutters not making the best content. So they went in hard on replicating the variety of a cable subscription, reality shows, cooking shows, travel shows, teen shows, action, comedies, fantasy, sci fi. Instead of trying to make the best content they settled for producing the most. With the idea being that they needed to fill their catalogue ASAP to replace all of the licensed content that would be leaving. They forewent quality for quantity. Its hard for me to justify paying $20/mo for the one show that Netflix produces that might be good and tbh piracy readily fills that hole. The Witcher was the third most pirated show of 2021.\n\nLuckily they have oodles of cash, the best streaming technology, but as a tech first company it‚Äôs glaringly obvious that their weakness lies in their content production. Just because you can poach people from other networks with your big salaries and loaded stock options doesn‚Äôt mean you have the expertise.\n\nNetflix IMO is still in the lead, but that lead has been cut dramatically from what it was just three years ago.", "score": -5, "replies": []}, {"body": "Good riddens nflx!

So if you buy 100$ worth of it today you will get 100+3.12 by end of 6 months form now. Then based on inflation stats, gov would have announced a new rate in may 22 which would be applied for your last 6 months of the year. There is a site which is tracking this inflation stats from gov for nov, december.. to figure out whta it could be in may [https://tipswatch.com/2022/01/12/u-s-inflation-surged-7-0-in-2021-the-highest-rate-in-40-years/](https://tipswatch.com/2022/01/12/u-s-inflation-surged-7-0-in-2021-the-highest-rate-in-40-years/)\n\nSo it could be another 3.5% annual = 1.7% for last 6 months. \n\nWhich means over the 1st year period, you could make about 5$ on a 100$ i bond investment. This all depends on what the rate will be in may 22. \n\nAlso understand that you need to hold ibond for minimum of 1 year and then if you sell it back to the us gov between 1 and 5 years, you lose last 3 months of interest. Which is still not bad considering your bank is prob giving you a big ol 0 in interest right now. \n\nLastly, why is it way less risky then stocks? mostly because you are literally giving US your own money to borrow. And US is giving you the inflation rate equivalent interest on this. \n\nYou can buy 10000$ worth of it every calendar year from the treasury direct website only. you need to be residing in USofA to be eligible and have an SSN. \n\nSo based on above, ibonds is not a good emergency fund if its your only emergency fund for the first year(Since you wont be able to sell it untill first year end). \n\nIts a great place to keep your emergency fund if you have held it for more than 1 year.

Don't look at the ETH chart and wonder where all the hashrate comes from, it surely is all from ASICs and AMD GPUs, ye totally that is where it is from! \n\nDo yourself a favor. Go look up ETH hashrate for 2021, calculate how many cards that is. Then compare that growth rate with Nvidia revenue numbers. Then do the same for 2018 H1 (as in the actual year, not Nvidia financials) and the numbers they posted back then. Sure, some will be from ASICs and AMD, but most will be Ampere and a lesser degree Turing.\n\n\nAnd that is just crypto. The gaming market situation is another point that will not last. You can't upsell people to a 3090 for inflated prices if the 3070 they actually wanted is in stock. Nvidia has benefitted massively from pushing people up the stack in the past two years, that will not last either.\n\nIn fact it will straight up harm their future sales since people will have hardware that is \"good enough\" for longer than if they had bought lesser cards. Someone who bought a 980 Ti back in 2015 can still play games decently to this day at 1080p. Meanwhile someone on a 970 is really wanting to upgrade by now if they still have it. The same will hold true for people being forced into higher brackets today.\n\nEdit: Don't get me wrong, Nvidia is still a good growth company with a bright future ahead and I'm not saying they are some failed company.

The rapid earnings expansion we've seen over past couple of year is almost entirely due to stimulus measures. No one is expecting earnings growth to be as strong this year as it was last year, and this has been priced in given that the market today is trading at a fairly typical multiple given where expected growth and interest rates are.\n\nThe concern would be a 2008 type scenario where earnings growth doesn't just slow, but turns negative. Negative earnings growth is much harder to model because you need to try to guess when growth will pick back up and how low earnings might fall before that happens. In that kind of scenario there's really no limit to how low valuations could go. This could happen if the FED makes a policy error, but there is also some macro economic risk that could potentially derail the economy. There's no reason right now to think this is going to happen.\n\nAs for NFLX, they didn't post a decline in earnings, in fact their earnings came in higher than expectations, the problem for NFLX was that their subscriber growth declined more than expected. And even then it was still growth, just not as strong as it has been. To be honest I'm not sure you can really extrapolate slower Netflix subscriber growth into slowing, or negative earnings growth for the rest of the economy.

The average weighted PE on the S&P500 has come down from 39 to 25.5 in just the last 12 months. A 25.5 PE isn't a high multiple compared to recent history when the 10 year was in a similar place.\n\nAlso when I model the projected growth and the recent rise in the 10 year yield the S&P500 seems to be at about the right level. Perhaps a little high, but it's less than 5% over my price target at this point so within the margin of error. This is assuming a 7% annual earnings growth rate which is a little below the 9% estimate and I'm using 1.8% as the risk free rate which is where the 10 year yield is currently sitting, but it's possible this could go higher.

Multiples are high compared to long-term historical averages, but the metrics most people cite here as evidence of a bubble don't take into account interest rates. When you factor in interest rates you tend to find the market is around the right price.\n\nThat said I do think the market is still a little high and we probably could go lower, especially if the 10 year starts to rise again or tech earnings come in weak...

The whole point of any investment, is to put some out and then receive small amounts (hopefully increasing) over time. Speculation however, is based on the expectation of the 'greater fool theory'. Considering the asset has no cash flows, the only cash flow can come from selling the asset. \n\nMost 'investors' do not 'invest', they speculate. It is an important distinct to make. Another way of thinking about investing (from Warren Buffett) is that you aren't buying 'shares', but a whole business (and you just happen to own part of it). You wouldn't sell shares in the company if it went up or down on a day. The whole point of you owning this business is to receive dividend income for the next say (60 years). \n\nWhen you get disappointed about the stock price, you should look to the fundamentals of the business. The stock price is just a show. One of the issues with investing these days is that people leverage their lives to stock prices. If a stock goes up 10x then down 10x, after say 2-3 years, a significant portion of these investors will be bankrupt, as it would have only taken 10% margin to wipe you out in these circumstances. Living this way introduces tail risk. \n\nTesla right now makes about $12 per year (assuming a $3 EPS \\*4). If you say own 1,000 shares, you are effectively earning $12,000 per year. That is about 1.2% a year. You can retire when the profit on your shares exceeds your expenditure. Living in this way massively reduces the tail risk as a result of valuation moves. \n\nAll of the FIRE stuff works off the basis of market cap. If the stock market goes down 80%, your income is reduced by the same. A 'hypothetical 100% dividend payment' is much less likely to go down 80%. If a company falls massively, but still is making profits, that will be highly supportive to its valuation. A company like Apple might go down by 50% in a massive correction, but it won't go down 80%. They are just buying back too much stock for it to get that low. Tesla could go down 80%.\n\n**TL;DR Look at and only spend the net income your holdings make. This is your actual 'income'.

As an example, loss aversion implies that one who loses $100 will feel twice the emotional pain as another person will feel satisfaction from receiving $100. Common indications include checking your portfolio on an almost daily basis, selling funds before you intended to lock in profits, or selling when you didn't intend to in order to avoid further losses.\n\nThis may have evolutionary roots.\n\nHypothesis: A caveman who lost food was likely to suffer starvation or even death.  Loss was often permanent, as stolen food could be eaten by others, or become inedible due to spoilage.  People who had loss aversion characteristics were more likely to survive than those who did not.\n\nBut stocks are not food.\n\nWhen the markets don't want to pay as much $ for a stock, the vast majority of shareholders are not going to starve.

Here is the dynamic of long term VIX chart. You can see we are off a multi-year wedge, breakout and confirmation.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b9nneebpbrc81.png?width=2562&format=png&auto=webp&s=a26c71b1f0fbd29da7820ebe227ba6c82b3a34bf\n\nThe last peak of VIX was 50 in Feb 2018, the peak during March 2020 was 85.  A\n\n85/50 = 1.7x\n\nThe wedge breakout in 12/31/2020 was 20, the latest wedge breakout that happened in 12/2/2021 was 34\n\n34/20 = 1.7x\n\nBased on this trend, the next VIX will hit 1.7x 85 = 145.\n\nThis would imply close to a 65% crash in a matter of 1 week sometime in Feb.\n\nHere is where we are compared to Feb 2020.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/shu618vderc81.png?width=2384&format=png&auto=webp&s=750ba34ee1ccac0c7c6085c964e1e126a982008b\n\n\\*\\*Update 1/20 10:45AM:\\*\\*SPX still in a big head and shoulder, if it breaks above 4615, i may change my view, but this looks just a retest of support before a big fall.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7c96lkrn7vc81.png?width=2409&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b0428cefa0f5b938ab1adec4b0610a36fcf4204\n\nMeanwhile the 10 year is in a falling wedge about to breakout, this is setup for a potentially large crash tomorrow during opex.
