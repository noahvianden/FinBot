I am yet to play with all the features yet. \n\nWhat I will say about Ford/Chevy/GM is that no matter where you drive across the country you will find a dealership.

So far, they have seemed largely immune to the chip and other supply chain shortage issues that have pestered Ford, GM and others. Led by a charismatic (say what you will about Elon) founder, they have been terrifically successful in using the capital markets to their benefit (raising tens of billions of dollars at market highs). There's no question that they are a much better company than your average auto manufacturer and (outside of the fact that they are in a fundamentally lousy business) could be one of the best companies in the world. Yes, there's a lot of hype and BS (Cybertruck, semis, robotaxis, AI, robots, etc.) and even some quality and other issues, but the cars have a lot of demand and this will continue to be so (and they will continue to execute on being able to fill that demand for quite some time).\n\nNow, to your second point about market share and profitability.\n\nI wrote this quote from Terry Smith on another thread just now:\n\n>“As Jim Chanos, the renowned short seller, observed ‘The worst thing that can happen to reopening stocks is that we reopen.’ It is often better to travel hopefully than to arrive.”\n\nBy extension, the worst thing that can happen to the Tesla stock is that they actually get to 20 million cars annually.\n\nIMO, the stock is 100% a \"trading sardine\" at this point.

When I started investing in Apple before the pandemic, around 2018, everyone told me to ignore it. They said it was overrated, that there were better stocks out there that could lead to larger gains. They all said Apple was going downhill and that there was no way it could outperform the previous year. Instead of chasing quick gains in other stocks, I went in heavy in Apple. Apple went on to become my largest holding. I sold most other stocks just to hold this one. Is there risk associated with this? Yes. Could it tank on bad news? Yes. Could something disastrous happen like poor quarterly earnings? Yes. Yes, yes, yes. You have to be willing to take risks in life to get rewarded. You have to accept the risk and understand the scope of the consequences if things go sour. I go sleep peacefully at night because I know it's Apple, a company that's had a massive following in the past 40 years. Apple is a long term hold due to its strong cash position, good earnings record, aggressive stock buy back program, and worldwide brand recognition. It's got the Apple Car and the VR headset/glasses coming up which could be huge catalysts. If you look at a 5 year chart, needless to say Apple has been a great investment for me so far. If I diversified, I would've never seen the massive gains that I have now. It's also a large part in any tech ETF or index you may be familiar with.\n\nTLDR: Go all in if you can accept the risk knowing the future is uncertain, if you're willing to accept the outcome whether it's good or bad. But don't invest in it if you have any hint of doubt, if you find a better company or a better stock, or if you want safety.", "score": 35, "replies": [{"body": "Buy what you know, and let your runners run.

They also believe apple is 'overvalued' quoting sales ratios and pe ratios. But I truly believe apple is continually growing.

It seems the movement is b/c of recession fears (caused by Omicron's recent 'wave'). You see this from the decline in the 10Y as well as a rotation to value from growth. This really makes no sense whatsoever. If Omicron is going to cause a recession, it's only going to be for a month (which isn't even a recession). Omicron has already rolled over in the USA. \n\nSo let me get this straight, last week the market was super worried about inflation, so Tesla went down 15% (after the pop). After the PPI and CPI, being lower than truly expected, the market is now worried about the exact opposite of inflation, i.e. a recession. All in the space of a week.\n\nThe reality is, omicron is likely to go away, and then the economy will go back to the natural trajectory it was finding (before Omicron). I don't think the impact from Omicron will be anywhere close to that of the other supply chain interruptions. So it's unlikely there will be a large spike in inflation say in \\~3-6months. \n\nAny time the 10y goes down, the margin of safety for growth stocks should increase. This is in effect what we have seen happen since Monday last week. Net net, inflation risk is way down, and Tesla posted very good numbers. The margin of safety is improving daily.\n\nI think we are still in this growth v value purgatory, where external shocks like Omicron hide the true underlying economic trends, i.e. is inflation really caused by printing or was it COVID supply chain related.

{"title": "Today's Lesson: How To Become A Bagholder In 10 Days", "selftext": "Gather round kids.\n\nTime to share with you the secrets of becoming a bagholder.\n\nFirst lesson. Buy an overpriced expensive stock just because everyone else is doing it.\n\nCase in point. GameStop. A whole bunch of retards followed DFV into the biggest meme in history. They bought and bought and bought and bought until it mooned and then they eventually thought that some internet guy who sells adult dog toys would turn GameStop into the next Amazon.\n\nWell, it didn't moon because GameStop will become the next Amazon. It didn't moon because they hired the castoffs from Amazon and other large companies. It mooned because a bunch of lemmings with stimulus checks and past due rent payments decided to yolo into a stock that was heavily shorted and got huge press from DFV.\n\nNow that you can see the moon, you should realize that it's time to sell. Not because you're in the green, but because you're about to be in the red.\n\nSecond lesson. Hold on to an overpriced stock until it round trips and goes through the floor. \n\nCase in point. AMC. A whole bunch of mouth breathers decided to follow some dumb post saying that they could do the same thing for AMC that they did for GameStop. That for some reason it made sense to do a bail out on a company that sells overpriced popcorn and charges you $15 to see a movie that you can see for free on HBO Max.\n\nWell, guess what. You might be one of the shareholders in the green, but that doesn't mean you'll stay there. Why? Because the very people who work for you are selling their shares.\n\nBut wait. How can they do that? They work for us, right? Nope. You're the mark. You're the dumb money. You're the bagholder in an abusive relationship where your partner tells you to buy nice things while they are turning around and selling them at the Pawn Shop for pennies on the dollar. For those familiar with the parlance. It's called dilution. And it is the reason you'll be a bagholder if you don't sell.\n\nWell, that's it for today.\n\nPerhaps we'll go over the lessons taught by Chammath next week.\n\nUntil then, don't be a bagholder. \n\nDrop your bags on someone else instead.", "id": "s39ii1", "created_utc": 1642107601.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.36, "num_comments": 185, "comments": [{"body": "Positions or ban", "score": 34, "replies": [{"body": "![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "Well I guess I'm gonna double my GME position now tomorrow at market open.
