But, the street reading 5 hikes is now more of a baseline with this latest PCE reading. What if PCE continues to hit new highs in Feb, Mar? Now you'll probably think he'll do 5 at that point, but the street will move to predicting 6. Retail is always behind the ball.

This results in very strong a Kruger effect amongst investors.\nBest to invest in a company where you trust the management is going to make the most logical and best decision for every decision along the way.  \nThey have way more information and understanding than any investor/analyst hence their ability to make the  superior decision will always be better then our hypothetical decisions.\n\nMy thoughs on this is that of the margins are highest with the Y, demand is insatiable, we maximize the sale of them first. Makes no sense to sell anything else that has lower margins if its a trade off in capacity for many reasons:\n\n1. Selling 1M Model Y is much more profitable than 900k Model Y and 100k Cybertruck. And way way more profitable than 800k Model Y, 100k Cybertruck, 100k Cheap($25k) Model.\n2. Adding any variety in supply chain management increases production cost and lowers margins. It also reduces net capacity.  This means, by starting to build Cybertruck and Cheap($25k) Model, instead of 1M total cars built, it would end up at say 900k built, and each of them at lower margins including the Model Y.\n3. There is very little profit in a $25k Model.  Why do it when ModelX and Y is so profitable.  Why sell something just to make LESS money?\n4. I reserved a Cybertruck and cannot wait! However, if they build now, it will cannibalize production of the Model Y.  By waiting a year, supplys at that time will not cause cannibalization of the Y production. Also, competition in this segment is not coming in a meaningful way.  They combined will build 200k in the year? If even. Most importantly, it give Telsa more time to make the Cybertruck even more technologically advanced.  The refinement they will have on the Cybertruck i suspect will be huge.\n5. They have too much cash.  They can either start giving out dividends which will signal Tesla is no longer a growth stock and is now a blue chip, which will send the P/E ratio down and share will be worth mich less.

If I was Tesla I’d be trying to partner with national chains like Safeway so they can cover their roofs in solar and then store all of that as a backup so their refrigerators and freezers never loose power, but also combine it with selling back to the grid, or using that energy to power EV charging stations in the parking lot.", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "They weren't running at full capacity last year but they almost hit one million, just remember they are confident they will maintain 50+ percent with just the two factories right now.

So the chips are limiting production. If you have to choose between bulding 2 Model 3/Y or 1 Cybertruck/Semi, the choice is obvious. The Model 3/Y will make more profit, they have higher margins, they benefit from economies of scale, the production lines are already figured out, etc. They were clear about this and have been for like a year. In fact, the problem they're experiencing with the Chip Shortage is the EXACT SAME PROBLEM they were experiencing with batteries. They delayed the Semi and Cybertruck because they need more batteries per vehicle.\n\n> As a long time investor I was disappointed to hear that they are not focusing everything on fixing CT and semi which apparently have dropped down the priority list in favor of projects with no established market places.\n\nThere's nothing to fix because they're not broken. They have test vehicles of both the Cybertruck and Semi. From the leaks that are all over the internet it looks like they've finalised the production design for the Cybertruck. And Pepsi is expected to take delivery of 15 Semi trucks sometime soon, suggesting they've finalized the design for Semi too. These products have NOT \"moved down in priority\".

There was a massive shock that Elon would prioritize unproven robots with an unproven addressable market over new hotly expected car models.\nThis is understandable, as there are probably a few steps in Elon’s thought process that he seems unwilling to express explicitly at this time.\n\nLet’s begin with the obvious point: many people and many analysts think that the physical product that Tesla produces are the cars. In Elon’s mind, however, the physical product that Tesla produces are instead the factories that produce the cars – “the machine that builds the machine”.\n\nOne aspect to consider is that Elon has always wanted to have fully automated factories operating really quickly. Contrary to his initial expectations, however, there were a lot of steps that are hard to automate and it was necessary to use human labor instead (c.f. General Assembly). In his interview with Marques Brownlee he lamented that an operation like putting two cables together is trivial for humans, but is really hard for a robot.\n\nAnother aspect is the availability of workers. Over the years Elon has sent multiple tweets on the topic, including one very recently.\n\nThus it is extremely likely that a primary reason for Optimus was the need to optimize and automate the Tesla production process. It was pretty clear at the earnings call that Tesla plans to start using Optimus internally initially. Of course, as it develops over time, it would likely become a rather viable product itself.\n\nIn other words, analysts seem to miss that Optimus is very much related to Tesla’s car production, its capacity, and its margins.

And all we've heard of AGI is Elon sending one tweet saying [\"Tesla AI might play a role in AGI\"](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1483728729545363457), and now people believe that it's part of their core business.\n\nAs other people have commented, a car is inherently stable (it doesn't need to balance on anything), only has to work in two dimensions, and only has two inputs: driving a motor forwards or backwards, and turning a steering wheel.

The AI not only needs to recognize objects, but also identify its position down to the millimeter so that it can pick it up without missing it or pushing it away. It also needs to know how to pick up an object based on its shape, how malleable and deformable it is, and how much force to apply; picking up a wooden cube is very different than picking up a plastic bag. And this is just the software side of things, then there's the hardware side that needs to account for things like differing tolerances between motors, pinpointing the position of its limb in relation to where the body is, and the minimum amount the motors have to move in order to overcome static friction.\n\nIn other words, it's the difference between a car being able to identify a trash can and drive around it, and a robot that can walk up to the trash can, open the lid, and toss a plastic bag in.

Now, their animal BMIs are about 100x better than anything else used in academia while being far less invasive and destructive.

Since then, for 7 years, they've been landing nearly every single F9 and FH flight they've launched; for a total of 100 booster reuse flights. It's become SO trivial, it doesn't even make the front page of any major news site anymore and only does when something goes *wrong*. Now, EU with Arriane Next is copying the Falcon 9. Russia is copying them. China is copying them. India is copying them. Almost every major Aerospace player is making Falcon 9 clones to get their own reusable orbital class booster up and running before the Starship/SuperHeavy platform comes online. SpaceX was started by Musk. Tesla wasn't, but he got involved early and then eventually took over the company and became the head off and has basically been the head off for the better part of two decades. At this point, the balance sheet and earnings report all point to the fact that Tesla is where it is at today because Musk has insane ideas and doesn't take no for an answer.

Further, in their earnings call, they noted that they can achieve a 50% growth for FY22 with Fremont & Shanghai factories alone. Meanwhile, Berlin and Austin are beginning to come online. If you play it conservatively and say +30% instead of +50% for FY22... (936,222 BEVs \\* 0.3) + 936,222 = means they'll sell at least 1,217,088 BEVs for this year with those two active factories. It takes several years for other factories to ramp, but if you were to add say 15% production capacity from either into this equation for this year, then you're looking at 30% between Fremont & Shangai + 30% between Berlin and Austin for a total of 60% growth for FY22. That means: (936,222 BEVs \\* 0.6) + 936,222 = 1,497,955 BEVs for FY22.\n\nGM claims it wants to sell 1M BEVs in 2025 and exceed Tesla by 2030. If Tesla has reached nearly 1.5M BEVs 3 years before, then by 2025, Fremont, Shanghai, Berlin, and Austin will be completely ramping and you could probably double that output to 3M BEVs in 2025; 3x GM's expectations.\n\nWorse, Elon on the earnings call along with everyone else, stated and agreed that they will disclose by end of FY22 where their NEXT GigaFactory will break ground at.\n\nThe point to all of this is that Tesla has managed to disrupt and execute on every single front despite the so called \"whims\" and \"dreams\" of Elon, and in doing so, has exceeded every single benchmark, metric, and expectation in the market. Thus, for him to talk up Optimus Subprime this and that and FSD this and that doesn't worry me, because the hard numbers in their earnings reports...the math says that whatever crazy shit that's happening on their side of the fence is working.

That said though, labor does require expenditures in excess of energy and basic material cost. Let's assume, theoretically, that Tesla per GigaFactory prints 1000 bots and uses them to address material relocation and simple actuation tasks like connect wire A to wire B. There's 4 gigafactories, so 4K bots. That's fleet wide NN training that can occur in shadow mode (courtesy of the FSD platform running the core of the bot) coupled with basic tasks simultaneously. This labor can be quantified relative to the cost of a human doing the same work. How much does it cost to make a bot? Let's say $100,000.\n\nWell, a person with a 50k job on the factory line has a hidden cost of another 20-25k in benefits, so really the person is being paid \\~70k. This person also is only available 9-5, then another person comes in and takes his shift, and you have 3 cycles of 8 hour shifts to reach your 24 hour operation window. So really, you're paying $210,000 for 24 hour operational window. But if a bot costs only $100k, that means for a 24h window, you can get 2 bots for 3 humans. That seems asymmetric, but humans have fatigue tolerances. They get hungry. They need breaks bio and food. They have emotional and psychological needs.\n\nThese aren't bad things, but when you're producing hardware, they're risk and OpEx that you have to factor in. If you can do away with much of that overhead for future growth (not replacing present talent, that'd be dumb), then your revenue can exponentially increase and same with gross and net profits. Additionally, as said elsewhere and by others, Moon/Mars ambitions of SpaceX does play a factor here (as SpaceX/Tesla have collaborated before on other projects in the past. The gigacasting alloy is one project. SpaceX sourcing Tesla motors and batteries for Starship development is another.) Developing autonomous humanoid bots is immensely valuable for space economy (LEO and post LEO). You won't be replacing humans as much as you'll be augmenting the workforce significantly.\n\nInstead of sending 1,000 humans to build a base, you can send 10 or 50. Each of them would oversee some bot group who'd be responsible for base building, clearing, connecting of materials and wires, etc. The hard *labor* would be taken care off by these bots, because exertion is an aerobic activity and lifting heavy things to put them together on Moon or Mars where every gram of oxygen and nitrogen is precious, would mean that doing all this heavy activity would require you to ship way more oxygen/nitrogen/water/food during the initial trip than you would otherwise. That mass which freed up by these bots, can then be repurposed for more structural growth/farming/nutrients, etc.  \n\n\nI think a lot of people are missing the forest for the trees and jumping the gun for this far off reality by thinking it'll happen tomorrow or the year after. Even if they manage to figure out to **print** the bot at scale, it still has to LEARN and TRAIN and UNDERSTAND its environment. It's taken Tesla approximately a decade to get to where it is today. Dojo will help accelerate that learning curve, but I have confidence that it's going to take Tesla the better part of this ***decade*** to do similar things with the bot and its own FSD style learning curve. If you want to be concerned about the bot and its broader market impact, perpend your expectations with a caveat of 2027-2030 and not sooner.

If they are not confident about demand, what about others who have even lesser pre orders ? Example - Lucid only has 17k orders. IMO  It will be obvious to market that no one wants a EV other than a Tesla. Will Toni Spaghetti shut his mouth then ? What’s the impact on share price when there’s literally unlimited demand and competition nowhere in sight. \n\n2) It’s pretty hilarious that Rivian is asking for transfer of technology even without committing for firm orders - that too from Samsung. Are they Fing out of their minds ? Samsung management would have had the best laughs of their lives.

The nutty big number. Ok, lets get calculating.\n\nI assume that profit for Tesla per year is:\n\n    profit = fsd_cars * usage_rate * (subscription_fee + distance_driven * ride_fee)\n\nThat equation is simple enough but lets put numbers on it. For simplicity, lets assume the Tesla fleet grows 50% per year and that there are 1 Mio cars FSD capable on the road today. Also all future cars will be FSD capable. Then we can calculate fsd_cars for 2030:\n\n    fsd_cars = 1Mio * (1 + 1.5 + 1.5^2 + 1.5^3 + 1.5^4 + 1.5^5 + 1.5^6 + 1.5^7 + 1.5^8) = 74.88 Mio\n\nSo we have anbout 75 Mio FSD cars. Lets say we have a usage_rate of only 20%. So that includes all services and all private people that put their cars to FSD use. So we have about 15 Mio cars that do FSD taxi service.\n\nLets say conservatively, that only people who let their car do taxi service is licencing FSD for $200 per month. Now that is very conservative as many people will licence it without FSD service and the price will be higher too. But lets go with these numbers.\n\n    subscription_fee = 12*$200 = $2400\n\ndistance_driven is hard to estimate. I have no idea how much utilization would be realistic. But lets say we have 100km of driving per day, or 36500km per year. I pulled that number out of my ass, but I think its going to be easily achievable. ride_fee is only the part that is profit for Tesla. So lets say Tesla charges 50ct per km, of which is half for the car owner and half for Tesla. So we have $0.25 profit per km. Then we have\n\n    distance_driven * ride_fee = 365*100*$0.25 = $9125\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n    profit = fsd_cars * usage_rate * (subscription_fee + distance_driven * ride_fee)\n    profit = 15Mio * ($2400 + $9125) = $173B\n\nThe result: $173B in profit, JUST from FSD. And we used conservative numbers. I would say even VERY conservative numbers. But thats $170 per share. Lets say without a split and a few % dilution per year due to employees and elons packages its going to be \"only\" $100 per share. Giving it a multiple of 20, its going to be $2000 per year share price in 2030.\n\n    FSD_profit_share_price = $2000\n\nAnd its going to grow with every new car, but will eventually asymptote towards 30Mio new cars * lifetime per car (assuming Tesla is limited to 30Mio cars per year).

The potash absorbs CO2 from the air, after which the liquid is piped to a second chamber and mixed with calcium hydroxide. The lime seizes hold of the dissolved CO2, producing small flakes of limestone. These limestone flakes are sieved off and heated in a third chamber, called a calciner, until they decompose, giving off pure CO2, which is captured and stored.

It's really tough to imagine that a key part of making that plan was:\n\n* Musk anticipating that they'd delay launching cybertruck to focus on existing models\n* that he'd make that announcement on the Q4 earnings call four months later\n* that the market would react to that news negatively\n* the negative effect would be bigger than whatever positive effect there was because of the financials, or that the financials would even be positive, they weren't even in Q4 at that point\n\nAlso, the price when they filed the trading plan was about $750, so even if Musk sold in this past week in the 850-950 range that would've been a big increase from 750.\n\nAlso, if Musk hadn't been selling last year, who knows where the price would be right now? Maybe it would've been higher before earnings, and even with a drop from \"bad\" news it would be higher than where it is now? Or maybe Musk's selling took a little pressure off of an overheated market and prevented a panic and correction? It's incredibly hard to predict what the market would do in these kinds of situations, or predict what would've happened if major events happened differently.\n\nIt seems like Musk wanted to get all the selling needed to pay taxes on his options done by the end of 2021, which means it was a probably primarily driven by tax considerations.

Pay for the house CASH.\n2. Get a loan and pay for mortgage.\n3. Invest in the S&P500 and pay for mortgage every month by taking the monthly payment from the S&P500 balance.\n\n# Here are the Factors :\n\n\\-Mortgage interest rate : 6% per year fixed.\n\n\\-Mortgage period : 15 Years.\n\n\\-Down payment : 20%.\n\n\\-Interest on my 100K if sitting in a bank account: 0%.\n\n\\-S&P500 average return :  10.5% per year.\n\n\\-Inflation rate : 2% per year.\n\n\\-Taxes on investment gains : 0%.\n\n\\-paperwork fees & all fees : $0\n\n\\-Property appreciation : 0%\n\n\\-Currency : $\n\n\\-Value = price - inflation rate\n\nHere come the numbers, I'm an idiot so correct me if I'm wrong please!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-If i go with option N°1: my total cost would be : $100K TODAY. Value =$100K since there's no inflation yet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-If i go with option N°2:  my total would be : 20K down payment + 80K principal + 41,5K interest=  $141,5K.\n\nSince inflation is 2%, in 15 years it would be 30% total, but because of the fact that inflation is gradual, the average inflation rate on 121K (principal+intrest) should be 15.83% after 15 years, so Value would be less hence, Value =  102,279+down payment of 20K= $122,279.\n\nSo in conclusion from the first 2 options, after 15 years paying cash would be a better option than mortgage, since even after factoring inflation I'd still be paying 22% more in value if i chose getting a mortgage.\n\nAnd without factoring inflation using price rather than value, I'd be paying 41.5% more on a mortgage vs paying cash.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow let's go with option N° 3 this one is  a bit more complicated for my monkey brain.\n\nThe plan is to invest 100K in the S&P500 index fund and every month I'd withdraw  $781.96 which is the monthly payment for the mortgage, my questions are:\n\nIs it better to pay cash or to use option N°3?\n\nCan the gains pay for my interest? or better yet, pay for the interest and leave a positive balance on my portfolio?\n\nIf i go with option N°3: my  total would be: 100K initial investment - 20K down payment  - 781.96 per month for 15 years  +10.5% per year (I used interest calculator) should be = (negative)  -$37,677.\n\nThe way i go this number is by calculating how much 10.5% per year would yield me if i invest $80Kand take out  $781.96 every month for 15 years. and the answer is  $79,177. Total yield paid. that's a total of 98.9% return in 15 years!\n\nMeaning i can pay the 100K principal + 41,5K total  interest and still have $37,677 hence the negative number in the last equation, i did not factor inflation in this case since if I did I'd have to factor it on the mortgage and the investment gains and they'd just cancel each other out.\n\nIf you wanna factor inflation on the remaining $37,677 , it'd be worth  $  30,141in 15 years.\n\nIf you wanna factor Taxes at 20% you'd still be able to pay for the interest and keep   $ 30,141 valued at  $ 21,099after 15 years of inflation.\n\n## Conclusion:\n\nOption N°3 is the best since you'd be able to pay interest for free & have a nice bag of cash afterwards, unless of course you're me in which case as soon as you buy $SPY the market will go into a recession and will not recover until after 15 years yielding you $0 and you'd have no house and no money since you sold the bottom the end.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPS: it's 4am and I'm an idiot who wanted to answer this question which kept me awake for 2 Hours i posted it here so i can be corrected if I'm wrong please feel free to call me names, i want to laugh a little is this red sea of death.", "id": "sfa0bq", "created_utc": 1643430910.0, "score": 27, "upvote_ratio": 0.69, "num_comments": 143, "comments": [{"body": "TLDR; Never Again\n\nA long time ago in a galaxy far far away, the bottom absolutely fell out of the stock market and the housing market.  As a mortgage broker, my job disappeared and I worked physical labor to get by.  I was pretty young and I spent everything I made as a broker, my lack of savings did not concern me, my property was appreciating, that was my savings, right?  Wrong.   Eventually, I gave up on paying anything but my housing payment, destroyed my credit with collections and chargeoffs, and worked some truly poopy jobs to keep the house and to keep living.  Never Again.\n\nAfter going back to school for a masters, I squared away the chargeoffs and collections and aggressively started paying off the house, because: Never Again.\n\nIn about 8 years I had whittled the mortgage down to a small amount and refinanced it to a 7 year mortgage at 2.5%, because: Never Again.\n\nI had rebuilt my credit, but I bought a new car with cash, because: Never Again.\n\nI did not finance anything, I bought everything with cash, and I also kept plugging away with extra payments on that 7 year loan while squirreling away a year's worth of money to live on, because: Never Again.\n\nThen COVID hit and I sold that house for ridiculously more than it should have been worth.  I could easily have gotten a mortgage for a very nice house, but: Never Again.\n\nI bought a decent place with cash and added even more to my arsenal of 'what if' money, because: Never Again.\n\nI truly hope that our economy never again suffers another event like that of 2008-2013ish, but if it does, I will have no bills and I will not have to toil at poopy jobs to cover expenses.  The money I invest is not the money in my squirrel fund and it is not the money I netted from the house, it is additional money that I can lose, because: Never Again.\n\nI was fairly sure I knew what the future would bring back then and if I could think about it without crying for how hard those years truly were, I'd probably laugh.  \n\nIf you can be liquid, please consider it, just in case, none of us know what the future will bring.", "score": 105, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you good Sir for sharing valuable lessons you’ve learnt over time!

{"title": "RobinHood $45 PT", "selftext": "Okay boys and girls. I’m going to give it to you dry, and keep it simple. Robinhood plunged off the face of the fucking planet to the depths of hell. Even from its IPO it’s down like -65% if you factor in the ATH of $85 the stock was down -90% when it hit lows of $9.94. I understand this company isn’t profitable YET. They also have a bad rep with the AMC & GME crowd but I could care less what people think who have been throwing money at a bankrupt movie theater chain and a brick and mortar gaming store. Although Q4 was ugly and guidance was lowered for Q1 and comps for both the first and second quarter are going to be tough due to year over year comparisons guess what? After a -90% decline it’s all priced in. The idiots shorting at $9 and $10 really thought this was going to a penny stock. That’s the beauty of the market it’s been pricing in a negative earnings for months before they released them. Everyone was left in awe as the stock reversed its -30% loss then proceeded to close green +10% \nNow the DD. If you look at the balance sheet. Almost no debt. 6B in cash, plenty to get them too profitability, and there’s too many things to list as far as projects they’re working on. What stood out to me is when they said they’re expecting to be profitable by year end or the very latest Q1 of 2023. I’m going balls deep here. This is going to be a year long play for me until they turn a profit end of 2022 or beginning of 2023. I’m playing shares just because of how volatile this market is, but leaps are cheap AF right now due to the epic plunge. Play it how you want but Friday signaled a pretty huge reversal. Also say what you want about Cathy Woods but she added another 2M shares.  She manages 60B in funds so I rather follow her then take stock advice from the Walmart restock workers here.
