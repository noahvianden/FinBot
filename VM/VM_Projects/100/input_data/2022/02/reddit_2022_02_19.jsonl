If you a an intelligent man, you would keep good and healthy relationship based on trust with your neighbors if you happen to be an elected president.\n\nSecond, nobody in Russia is afraid of NATO intervention. Because west don't have any incentive for it. Current western economics is build around open markets and qualified brains, not around raw resources.

Financial stocks are still basically at ATH. Energy stocks are up over 30% in the last two months. QQQ sold off 18% in a month, and then shot back up 10% in 3 sessions. That's a whippy fucking market.\n\nKeep in mind also, that a stock that has sold of 70% has more risk to the upside generally speaking. It could easily sell off another 70% from current levels, but it's statistically far more likely to come back up. The last thing you want to do is sell the dip. The S&P could close over 6,000 this year. The market \"funk\" could end at any time and rebound 10%, 15%, 20%. We could also keep drifting lower.", "score": 65, "replies": [{"body": "Quantitative tightening hasn't even begun yet. All of this is in anticipation of the Fed raising rates and shrinking its balance sheet. But what happens when the Fed actually does raise rates and shrink its balance sheet?!? No way we get close to 6000 on the S&P with a Fed that's tightening and sucking up liquidity. My feeling, unless the Fed pussies out and doesn't raise rates or shrink its balance sheet, is we're gonna see a bunch more volatility in the months ahead.

Just because they are ending QE doesn't mean they are tightening.\n\nKeep in mind the market is forward looking. If the Fed says they will raise rates 5 times in the next year, that's already priced in. When it actually starts, nothing will happen. If anything we'll probably see a rebound, because they won't actually do as many rate hikes as they are suggesting.\n\nInterest rates aren't directly related to stocks the way they are bonds. Just because interest rates go up, doesn't mean that stocks will go down. It's been that way in the recent past, but this is not necessarily the case. I think the reason the inverse correlation  is so strong lately, is because interest rates are simply just too low. When fixed income products are not a viable investment, it means that money has to go somewhere, and that ends up being in equities. Once interest rates come up to a healthy level, the money that would have been in debt securities flows out of equities into bonds. It doesn't need to be this way though. I suspect in a healthier market, there is much less of a correlation.\n\nLastly, the Fed is not the god of the market. The bond markets are way too big and too deep for the fed to control. They can exert a lot of influence over short term rates, but that's it. It seems like people think Powell is some kind of market controlling wizard with his finger on a button.

Hence why I recommend just letting your contracts come to their natural conclusion.

Sure, you've got some shit piles on, but I've always got at least one shit pile on that I'm working, selling options around, reducing cost basis over time.  That's just part of what happens, although it seems to have happened more than usual the past couple of options cycles.  (An ARKK position I have comes to mind).\n\nGiven that, I think it's more important than ever to keep an eye on both position delta and portfolio wide net delta and evaluate whether you want to be more directionally neutral here on a per position basis and on a portfolio wide basis than you would've for like the months and years leading up to all this sideways, indecisional whip.  \n\nIf you don't want to erect hedges directly on some of your individual positions (e.g., sell 25 delta call against at that 50 delta at-the-money short put that's currently being a pain in the ass -- it looked great one day and then shitty the next) because that would inject side risk into that play, consider doing something portfolio wide like a SPY Poor Man's Covered Put (buy the back month 90 delta put, sell the front month 30; net -60 delta) on strength to give you some of the short delta you need.\n\nI, for one, continue to sell broad market (SPY, IWM, QQQ) put in my IRA, but ***hedged*** with a short delta Poor Man's.  Portfolio net delta is still long; it's just not as long as if I were all naked short put.\n\nOn margin, I'm continuing to sell short straddle/strangle and then adjusting individual positions defensively (i.e., roll untested side on oppositional side test or on approaching worthless, etc.).  Even that, however, hasn't been the greatest.  I've adjusted and then gotten whipped the other way.  But since you don't know what this manically depressive market is going to do in any given session, you adjust mechanically to keep your stuff from getting overly directional.  Stuff gets broken.  It isn't fun, ties up buying power, but working off shit that has gone wrong is part of this game.\n\nI disagree that covered calls and/or short puts are, in fact, less productive here as a function of buying power effect.  If anything, they are ***more*** productive due to heightened implied volatility.  Naturally, this is a generalized statement.  IV may have collapsed relative to where it's been in individual names such that they are not as productive from a premium selling standpoint than before or (more likely what you're talking about) the underlying has collapsed in price to such a degree that you can't reduce cost basis effectively in shorter duration because you have too much ground to make up and the premium being paid is \"small\" relative to your cost basis, even though it's decent relative to the price at which the underlying is currently trading.\n\nJust my two cents, but long a static Johnny one lot (100)/long a -70 delta put (+30 delta) (or its inverse short a one lot, long a call isn't synthetically akin to a 30 delta dynamic short put (if that's the setup you're going for).  It's more like a monied covered call (buy a static 100 delta one lot, sell a 70 delta call against; net 30 long delta).  It's a picky thing, but I'd rather do the monied covered call, since your break even/cost basis would be better relative to what you're suggesting due to extrinsic in the short, with the disadvantage (if it is one) being that I would never strip off the stock aspect of a CC in AH and allow the short call to \"ride.\"", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": ">and allows me to close the position after hours\n\nDon't forget about Market On Close orders for options, if one is so inclined.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah, I don't think I'd feel too comfortable holding short positions on mega caps in general.\n\nI like mid caps that are in debt.

This is the same problem I noticed with TSLA through much of the 2010s, when many people on social media and Reddit said all kinds of things about Elon and Tesla being a \"scam\".  \n\n**1. With regard to Alex Karp's compensation**, consider the S-1 form filed with the SEC prior to the public offering: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520230013/d904406ds1.htm#rom904406\\_13](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520230013/d904406ds1.htm#rom904406_13)\n\nP. 177 details the alleged \"bonus\" that the WSB OP is complaining about.  Specifically:\n\n* On, **9/22/2009** Dr. Karp was granted options for 60,897,579 shares at strike of 0.103, with expiration date **12/3/2021**\t \n* On, **1/24/2011** Dr. Karp was granted 8,000,000 options for shares at strike of 0.85, with expiration date **12/3/2021**\t \n\n**Note that these options were granted a decade+ ago**, as the U.S. economy was coming out of the Great Recession.  At the time, Palantir was a struggling company with some modest success supplying Intelligence analytics software to the U.S. government, but much poorer outcomes in getting the private sector to adopt \"Metropolis\", its commercial platform. \n\n**At the time the options were granted, it was possible that these options would have been worthless.**  \n\nAlso note that Dr. Karp had to exercise these options by December 3, 2021.  Failure to exercise those options from more than 10 years ago would have resulted in the options just vanishing. \n\nDr. Karp did exercise all of these options in 2021, using a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan (same as Elon last November) which exercised options and sold shares for taxes about once/month.  For example: [https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001321655/64ca5523-16d6-41c9-8ff6-c40f17c7fbc1.pdf](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001321655/64ca5523-16d6-41c9-8ff6-c40f17c7fbc1.pdf)\n\n* He exercised options for a bit more than 3.8 million PLTR B-shares, and converted and sold about 1.9 million of those shares (the 50% needed to cover federal income taxes).  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2. Share structure:**  It is true that Palantir's share structure gives the Founders (Peter Thiel, Alex Karp, and Stephen Cohen) de facto control over the company.  Class F shares have 49.99999% of Palantir's voting power, and these are all owned by Thiel, Karp, and Cohen.  Their more or less permanent \"Class B\" shares, which have 10 votes, basically push them over 50% voting power.\n\n* Palantir's share structure was set up this way, because the founders wanted to reduce the chances of foreign, potentially adversarial investors seizing control of the company. Palantir was founded as a business that provides software services to organizations in the United States and its allies.  The founders want to keep it that way.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3. Palantir's business**:  It's real, and it's growing.  Latest quarterly report: [https://investors.palantir.com/files/Palantir%20FY%202021%20Business%20Update.pdf](https://investors.palantir.com/files/Palantir%20FY%202021%20Business%20Update.pdf)\n\nPage 16, showing **U.S. Commercial Revenue,** is the most important slide.  Palantir's current commercial software platform, Foundry, began deploying to customers in 2019.  If you look at revenue from customers who started to use Foundry in 2019, it goes from 19 Million that year, to 69 Million in 2020, and 102 Million in 2021.  Total U.S. Commercial revenue is doubling every year, despite being a small % of their overall 1.5 Billion annual revenue.\n\n* This is important, because it shows that Palantir is not limited to government contracts. Its commercial business worldwide is growing nearly 50% every year.  Commercial growth is the future of Palantir's business.  Palantir's software provides companies with the ability to see what is going on in their organizations and make better decisions in things like manufacturing operations and supply chain management.  \n* Customers who bought Foundry licenses are keeping those licenses and expanding use of the software.  The 2019 customers kept increasing the $ they spent on it.  The software provides real value to customers.  \n\nThere's a ton more information that I can easily convey in a Reddit post, but I encourage people to dig much deeper than an unsourced FUD post from WSB.  \n\n**PLTR is a risky stock**, and Palantir's business is at a much earlier maturity stage than TSLA, but I think it has great potential.  [The company has about 2.5 Billion in liquid assets, zero debt, and generates 424 million in cash flow](https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2022/Palantir-Reports-Revenue-Growth-of-41-for-FY-2021-US-Commercial-Revenue-up-102-YY-in-FY-2021).\n\nIn full disclosure, as of yesterday, somewhere between 1-1.5% of my portfolio is currently in PLTR, and I continue to accumulate small amounts of shares while market sentiment is poor.

There would be zero chance of a peaceful occupation of Ukraine, even if the Russians could force the Ukrainians to surrender, which they most certainly couldn't.\n\nFurthermore, the Russians wouldn't actually be willing to commit even a significant portion of their military to an invasion and occupation, and the Ukrainians would not settle for any other outcome other than pushing the Russians all the way back into Russia in the event of a full-scale invasion. The Ukrainians wouldn't stop at current informal borders either, the counter-attack to an invasion would result in the liberation of Luhansk, Donetsk, and Crimea as the Ukrainians would no longer pretend to entertain any diplomacy with Russia over disputed regions.\n\nBasically Putin isn't invading because that's literally the worst case scenario for Russia, but it looks like NATO isn't going to budge and Putin has put himself in a bad position because if he just withdraws his units now he's going to look weak.

The more ambitious the goal, the more force necessary to change Kyiv‚Äôs and NATO‚Äôs cost-benefit calculus.

It could also involve occupying terrain outside Kyiv and threatening the capital unless Russia‚Äôs demands are met.

This could include shooting down TB2 drones if they fly near the Donbas or targeting their airfields with long-range munitions. Russia could also declare a no-fly zone or announce that the Russian military would respond to any further Ukrainian artillery strikes in the Donbas with an overt response from the Russian military.

For example, fuel efficiency of cars will lead to increased mileage to a larger extent than visits to restaurants would be increased by a better energy efficiency at restaurants (e.g. for cooking, fridges, heating): Energy costs make up a smaller amount of total costs for restaurants and will therefore influence their prices to a smaller extent, and thus also not the number of visits to restaurants.\n\nThis entire cycle is meaningless if there is suddenly nearly endless energy and storage, which is rapidly approaching. \n\nTo me they sound like they‚Äôve hyper-focused on a [civilization below stage 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale), without looking past it.\n\nWe have unlimited energy hitting our planet every day, and as soon as we‚Äôre able to harness it, this rebound effect ends.

It is all designed to elicit a certain response and communicate to the enemy a certain posture.   Once more- all warfare is rooted in deception.

Like say that oil reserves are getting more difficult to get at.  You have to drill deeper, use more energy to pump less out, get it from an expensive process like shale or tar sands, etc.  The cost of oil must increase if the energy returned on energy invested decreases.\n\nThen there is the case where demand outstrips supply.  Let's say that some disease spread through the cattle population and specifically hit dairy cows hard.  For some time, milk will be produced in volumes smaller than the demand for milk.  Dairy will increase in price in the scenario.  This is the type of inflation that you are saying is happening.  More money is out there and it is chasing the same number of goods and prices are increasing as a result.  But the data we have flies in the face of that narrative.\n\nInventories are INCREASING, meaning that supply is outstripping demand.\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/business/us-business-inventories-increase-solidly-december-2022-02-16/#:~:text=Business%20inventories%20increased%202.1%25%20after,on%2Dyear%20basis%20in%20December.\n\nCorporate profits are soaring, indicating that the price increases are padding their bottom lines.  If costs were increasing and prices were increasing as a result of that, then profit margins would have stayed the same, leading to limited growth.  We aren't seeing that.  We are seeing profits wildly increase and this indicates price GOUGING.\n\nhttps://www.businessinsider.com/companies-pocket-largest-profits-in-70-years-amid-inflation-complaints-2021-12\n\nThere is a third option wherein companies are raising prices in an environment where the media is pushing an inflation narrative.  Nobody questions that a box of cereal is .50 cents more.  They sell 3 billion boxes a year and they make 1.5 billion more in profits and all of it was done in a backdrop of \"inflation.\"\n\nThe thing is, people will still be pushing this horseshit narrative about the money supply, when the evidence that gouging is happening is right in front of their faces.  \n\nI have news for everybody: you CANNOT have growth in your economy without an expanding money supply.  The population is growing all the time and their absolute wages are growing all the time.  The number of companies that exist and their total revenues are increasing all the time.  How is it possible to do all of that with the same supply of money that existed in 1980?  It's NONSENSICAL.  It defies even simple arithmetic.\n\nAt the end of the day, prices rise because somebody decides to increase prices.  The market doesn't do that.  People do.  Those people obviously understand that selling things for a higher price will make them more money.  Then they whine about inflation while posting record profits.  The fact that people can't or refuse to put this together is soul crushing.  It's not that complicated.\n\nThe entire narrative that more money debases a currency is not supported anywhere in the data other than the coincidence that over time there has been inflation and over time the money supply has increased.   There isn't some gold mountain worth X amount of value and every dollar that comes into existence shares an equal portion of the value of that mountain.  \n\nMoney is fiat.  It has value because it has demand.  It has demand because you have to pay taxes and the only thing accepted for your taxes is the currency of your respective country.  That's it.  It is written right on the front of every American bill.  There's no mystery here.  Only dogmatic bullshit spread by Austrian economics which has been thoroughly debunked.  The models don't work and if they don't work they aren't good models.\n\nWhat we can show is deflationary pressures on increasing the money supply.  If additional money is spent on investing into supply chains, infrastructure and production, the costs of doing business decrease and prices decrease as a result.  Even if they do not decrease in an absolute sense, they can in a real sense.  We have seen this happen for years.\n\nTo wind up this rant, there was a supply shock at the beginning of covid.  It was transitory, but dipshits kept pushing the narrative that it was due to something else.  Then companies began raising their prices and boom, the CPI jumps.  Now we have inflation but the underlying cause wasn't that something had fundamentally changed, it was that people began charging more for things.  The proof of that is in the soaring profits.

{"title": "Nobody Cucks the Zuck", "selftext": "Mark Zuckerberg sits alone in his office, trying to grasp what has happened.\n\nHe's used to the mockery, the roasting; it's been his entire life. He can deal with that. He knows what jokes smell like.\n\nBut Facebook? Meta? Up until now they were his shining city on the hill; his magnum opus; his life's greatest achievement.\n\n\"Largest single day loss in history...\" He mutters to himself, eyes glazed over, deep in thought, slowly swirling his shirley temple. His second one this week; somebody's not sleeping tonight.\n\nTim Apple, Muskrat, even that fking cyberboomer Buffett have all been roasting his ass on the daily. On discord no less, they could have at least flamed him on WhatsApp. Not to mention literally everyone in Europe calling his bluff and telling him to gtfo. Even the retards on wsb have been making üåàüêª bank off his misery.\n\nEnough is enough, he thinks to himself.\n\nHe flies into action. His heart is literally beating and he knows it. He loves it. What a rush! He's never felt so alive. Revenge will be sweet.\n\nDescending down the crystal staircase from his office, he makes his way to the past the ball pit and his flat warm rock towards the room he thought he'd never have to open. He never thought it would come to this but he knows that he has no other choice.\n\nHe approaches the door and licks his lips way too much in preparation of speaking the password:\n\n\"Smokin' deez meats.\" He whispers, wetly.\n\nThe door beeps in agreement, a low hiss fills the air as the door unlocks and slowly swings open.\n\nThe room is dimly lit, large and lukewarm; just the way Zuck likes it. And there, directly in the center of the room, an old PC waits patiently for input. The CRT monitor hums ever so quietly from beneath it's very 80's style dust cover; like some shit straight outta Alien.\n\nThere it is. His ultimate weapon. His Doomsberg Terminal.\n\nThere's no turning back now. He rips the cover off, sits down, and slowly types out the name of his first victim:\n\n\"Timothy 'Apple' Cook\". He presses enter.\n\nThe off-white 486 whirs into action, retrieving all Tim 'Apple' Cooks Facebook instant messages, every single one, from back before everyone got wise to Zucks plans of stealing personal data to sell oddly specific t-shirts to fucking idiots. He thought it would make him a billionaire, turns out spreading misinformation amongst the stupid bastards was much more profitable.\n\n(What's that? You thought those messages were deleted when you deleted your FB account? LMAO!)\n\nHe begins searching through the messages, looking for some juicy dirt so he can finally bob this Apple, and for good.\n\nIt's not long before he finds it:\n\n\\[ Tim Cook \\] : So I'm like, \"You're shitting me right, Steve? You're a famous BILLIONAIRE, you could get the best cancer treatment in the history of mankind but instead you're gonna get acupuncture and drink fking Jamba Juice???\"\n\n\\[ Tim Cook \\] : Mfers turtleneck on too tight or something, smh\n\n\\[ Tim Cook \\] : Anyway bb as I was saying, I need access to all ur pics so I can make sure ur not a pedo k thnx\n\n\\[ Some thotty \\] : So can you fix my Compaq or nah\n\nThis is what Zuck has been waiting for. By threatening to expose Tim Apple as a massive douche who also hates privacy (he shudders at the mere thought of the word) he can blackmail him into reversing Apple's pesky ad revenue ruining policy and regain his rightful place back in the top 10.\n\nHe leans back in his chair; revelling in his sheer brilliance. He feels like a big man, not even the biggest congressional booster seat in the world could make him feel this tall. He hasn't felt this good since he saw the Social Network for the first time and asian chick they cast as his future wife was like 1000x hotter than his actual wife and it was confusing but awesome.\n\nHe gets up to leave, he's hard af but he doesn't even notice, all he can think about is who his next victim will be.\n\nKetchup loving boomer Buffett?\n\nTie-dye hippie doofus Dorsey?\n\nPeter \"I'm not a nazi u are\" Thiel?\n\nNo.\n\nHe knows who should be next.\n\nThat autistic twitter tourettes south african retard.\n\n\"Musk\" He says. \"If only you could have known...\" He smiles, bigly.\n\n\"Nobody cucks the Zuck.\"\n\n*Fin*", "id": "swlvz9", "created_utc": 1645310334.0, "score": 1305, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 139, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|22|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|10 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=swlvz9)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=swlvz9)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Meta to rock bottom after this shitpost.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "It didn't need help to reach that...", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Jet boosters past terminal velocity.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "I love this fan fic erotica.
