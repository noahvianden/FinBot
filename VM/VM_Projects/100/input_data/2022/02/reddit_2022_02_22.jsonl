Also the cause of the GFC was less so a stock market bubble, but the floor coming out of the financial system. \n\nIn the years leading up to the GFC there was a bubble in homes for sure (though we’ve since surpassed those home price levels). This was driven by the fact banks were securitizing the mortgages they were writing, then selling them to institutions (for the more senior/ higher rates tranches) and each other for the lower quality/ higher yield tranches (because why keep your cash in overnight reserves at no interest when you can put it into higher yielding securities and then pledge to them as collateral on the repo market to get your cash back)\n\nSo you had this situation where all banks had money in each other (directly via pledging the mortgage securities as collateral or indirectly my investing in each other’s CDOs). Not only that they were each leveraged to the hilt  (I think lehmans and bear Stearns were both around 35x assets to equity) \n\nSo in essence you had (illustratively) Morgan Stanley who had money in Goldman, who had money in Lehmans, who had money in Bear Stearns. Then AIG went and sold “insurance” to all of them in case their counterparts defaulted. \n\nWell you can see what happens to the daisy chain when home prices dropped and suddenly hoomerz couldn’t make their mortgage payments. Two of Bear Stearns mortgage funds blew up, which eventually caused all of Bear Stearns to blow up. All of a sudden the money Lehman thought it had in Bear Stearns goes poof, so it blows up, which means the money Goldman had in Lehman went poof… all the while AIG is now on the hook to make these guys whole, but wait they never underwrote this scenario where they all fail so there is no money to cover the losses. That is the essence of “too big to fail” and systemic risk that caused central banks to step in and break the daisy chain (including forcing some shotgun marriages).  \n\nJust as with the dot com bubble, our leaders decided to plug this hole by passing Dodd Frank (which banned banks from using customer deposits for proprietary trading and added in a bunch of consumer protection to reduce predatory loan activity). We also implemented Basel III regulation basically tried to contain too big to fail banks by putting in more strict leverage limits, which as I understand it get more strict as their shareholder equity increases, which discourages banks from ever becoming “too big to fail” again.\n\nSo the same reason the 2008 bubble burst for different reasons than the 2000 dot com bubble, the next bubble will burst for a different reason because we spent the past 15 years plugging the holes that caused the last one.", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "who knows? maybe ask someone smarter than redditors", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Margin calls don't see whether you're holding good stocks or trash.

This can skew outcomes when looking at growth stocks and fast-moving upstarts. For instance, a company might have a sizeable CAPE ratio during the 10-year run-up to market domination. However, this aggregated EPS might not represent a realistic expectation for the company’s future short-term outlook as it plateaus. \n\nCalculating the Shiller P/E ratio can also be a minefield, since Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) have a tendency to change over time. As GAAP rules change, so do the factors that account for a company’s earnings. Going back 10 years to gather EPS and adjusted earnings may skew the ratio. Again, this is the problem with a backward-looking metric used for current and forward-looking purposes. \n\nFinally, using the CAPE ratio as a broad-market benchmarking tool can result in inaccuracies due to mega-cap companies. In cap-weighted indices, significant movement at the top can skew any P/E metric.

I shit you not, they did it.\n\nThis is probably going to be a long post.\n\nSo how the internet worked in the 90s was businesses without business.  There was no such thing as a \"secure transaction\" so the companies that did do ecommerce (like Amazon) were really small potatoes because no one trusted internet companies with credit cards.  So what was funding the internet?  Well.... real world companies.  They would pay for advertisers who would give them reach that was too good to be true.\n\nThe internet's reach still is too good to be true, but not nearly as much as back then.  The confusion came when old school business didn't understand internet advertising metrics like impressions vs unique views and clickthroughs vs engagement.  Let's say you are scrolling through Reddit and you see an advertisement load up.  You see it, and then you scroll down and see it again.  That's two impressions, but only one unique view.  In the virgin internet advertisers would tell old companies they'd get thousands of views.... which advertisers thought meant unique views... and not impressions.  Similarly you would get paid extra if someone clicked on an advertisement.  But not all clicks are engaging.  Pop ups and forced clicks could cause people to go to websites without actually wanting to... the advertisee would pay the advertiser for something that gave them no value at all.  Of course  geolocation was also another problem, Bob's Plumbing in Vermont has no use for customers in Canada.\n\nCPM in the 90s (the golden age of internet monies) was anywhere from $40-$200 CPM.  CPM stands for \"clicks per mill\" and is the metric for how people get paid.  In modern times the modern platforms go as low as $0.20 CPM to $20 CPM.... which tells you how bad of a crash it was.\n\nSo anyway the New York Times published an article just before the crash explaining how the whole of the internet is actually a giant scam that sucks money from the real world (kind of like how most people view NFTs and cryptocurrency) and puts it into a fake world that provides no real value.  CPM rates crashed for just about all websites.\n\nAlan Greenspan rolls around and decides at that point to raise interest rates.  This causes a huge liquidity squeeze on hundreds of websites that have never made a penny and had no path to profitability.... they were just sucking endless investments to keep the pool parties going.\n\nEventually DotCom company after DotCom company just kept running out of money.  Some of them sold for their patents, but most just faded into obscurity (The website [Pets.com](https://Pets.com) IPOed and nine months later it just died).

{"title": "I told you so… The Great Wheeze is here.", "selftext": "Back in September of last year [I made a call that what’s playing out now, would](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pwvrsi/the_great_market_wheeze_is_almost_upon_us/):\n\nThe TLDR being: inflation was going to run hotter than expected, bond yields would move up, stocks would have to come down, growth stocks would get destroyed and the fed wouldn’t be able to come to the rescue because inflation tied their hands. I suggested value, shorting bond yields and buying internationally. I predicted this would start soon and accelerate early-mid 2022.\n\nI named this upcoming event \\*\\*“The Great Wheeze”\\*\\* - a slow slump based on liquidity exiting. \n\nThe response back then was this was crazy talk. Inflation was seen as mostly transitory, it’d peak at 5ish%. Markets were pricing in a couple of hikes (now it's 7 this year). Stocks went on a big Santa rally, value was cheap, NASDAQ was firing on all cylinders.\n\nInvestors, hedge funds, central banks and more didn’t know what was up. But a kid from the bush did. Told you so 😎\n\n\\-----------\n\nFirst let’s have a look at some of the friendly things people had to say 5 months ago:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I wonder during how many bubbles throughout history has this theory has been suggested and has it ever once played out?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Ivy league economists: \"yeah we really don't know. Its impossible to predict a timeline for such things with any degree of accuracy. Here is a 500 page peer reviewed book to prove our points.\" Dude on reddit: \" I've figured it out! T minus 12 months. Guaranteed. Here is 2 paragraphs of garbage to prove my point.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>You have no idea what you're talking about and are probably watching too many YouTube videos. I don't know what I'm talking about either, so let's both shut up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>What an absolute joke of a post. You don’t even understand basic yield formulas.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Try WSB for starting your own meme, take your amateur analysis there as well. To everyone else, steer clear of anyone who claims \"certainties\" like this, **ALWAYS**. This guy is leaving out many variables which cannot possibly be predicted and is grossly over-simplifying something as complex as a year+ forecast.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>High inflation will not happen. The Fed doesn’t control it and its appearance is absolutely not a certainty ; that is what the market is seeing and you’re not.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>The inflation we are seeing now is purely aggregate demand based, mostly due to high demand and supply chain issues and shortages and the tell tale sign of this is unequal increases\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>You lost me at certain parts but I admire the confidence\n\n\\-------------------------\n\nSo anyway here’s what’s going to happen next. This is barring any major black swan. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zad1lu8xqbj81.png?width=632&format=png&auto=webp&s=e50112570ee03af62ab16a2a672006a5745eca58\n\n\\-----------------\n\nKey Themes for 22 and beyond.\n\nWe’re entering into a couple years of stagnant growth, shrinking liquidity, increasing real interest rates and declining multiples. **You can’t price in excess or draining liquidity**, liquidity is the tide that all ships rest on. \n\n**The economy is not strong** like Powell, Biden and much of the media crowd say. Blowout deficits and QE have temporarily plastered over underlying weakness. \n\n**Inflation will peak shortly**, but will stabilise higher than pre-COVID (4-5%) for an extended period of time (years). Interest rates will still be negative in real terms and so much cash is floating out there. Central banks will have to be more hawkish going forward, so if the market crashes they'll do less.\n\nAt the end of the day the Fed and other central banks are in a bind. They won’t be able to increase interest rates above 3-4% to actually fight it. Even if they could, it’d cause a recession. \n\n**So the only solution is for developed markets is to devalue their currency.** This means extended inflation in developed markets, strengthening emerging market currencies. The era of exporting our inflation to the USD hungry 3rd world is over. [You can already see EM currencies starting to edge up](https://au.investing.com/indices/msci-intl-em-currency).\n\n\\----------------\n\nHow to play it?\n\nFirst, **Russia won’t invade Ukraine**, Putin will consolidate his holdings in the rebel regions but won’t go as far as to get hit with real sanctions. A lot of fuss and then things die down. Russian stocks are getting crushed, this is probably close to the absolute bottom so load up on $RSX. Hold for 6 months and make 30%, $RUSL will do better.\n\nWith declining multiples and weak customers almost all assets are going to suffer. I think it’s going to be very difficult for the next couple years to do well in anything. \n\nIf a 30 PE company growing at 10%/year falls to a 20 PE; it will take 5 years to grow back to even. Rapid growth can negate multiple compression if your entry point is attractive enough.\n\nGrowth is going to get oversold, but be careful of what type of growth you buy as most will still struggle. Growth is the answer not value.\n\nEmerging markets are the place to find small, fast growing companies at low valuations. As the inequalities between rich and poor nations are arbitraged away it is a certainty that EM will outperform developed significantly in the long run.

{"title": "Backtesting the most popular investment strategies over the last two decades!", "selftext": "I have a confession to make. Even after all the [analyses and strategies I have created](https://www.reddit.com/user/nobjos/?sort=top), I allocate most of my investments to the S&P500 while keeping some part of it for the moonshots. I have told the exact same thing to everyone who has asked me personally for investment advice.\n\nBut as explained in this [fantastic article](https://ofdollarsanddata.com/the-problem-with-most-financial-advice/) by Nick, the problem with most financial advice is that it’s biased heavily towards your experience. I started investing in 2017 and have experienced nothing but a bull market (albeit the brief Covid-19 dip). But consider the situation of someone who started investing in 2000 or in the peak of the 2007 bubble. In both cases, it would have taken more than 6-7 years just to break even on their investments. I can’t even imagine waiting more than half a decade just for my investment to grow to its initial value, given the current market conditions.\n\nGiven that there is no one size fits all approach in the stock market, in this week’s analysis, I am doing a deep-dive into the various types of investment strategies, the returns generated, and their limitations.\n\nI should warn you now that this is not about finding the strategy that gives you the most returns. This is more so about finding what type of investment strategy fits you the best. While putting all your portfolio into crypt\\* might end up giving you a 10,000% return (which is fully viable for a 20-something-year-old with a small portfolio), having an 80% drawdown is not something a 50-year-old with a retirement account would be looking forward to.\n\nThe point I am trying to make here is that investing isn’t an absolute game, it’s a relative game. What fits you perfectly might be terrible for others. Your risk tolerance might be way higher. So I am offering you a choice:\n\n[All I’m offering is the truth. Nothing more.](https://preview.redd.it/djttp8bdzdj81.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=72279b8af4bf16dcdacff63120f80f5d514aa008)\n\n>*You take the blue pill, the story ends, you can close the page now and believe that DCAing into S&P 500 is your best bet. You take the red pill, you stay in wonderland, and I show you how deep the rabbit-hole goes.*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9vxcbcg5zdj81.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ff1c8397b104cdf30d5042a4ec90adbe5038f39\n\nLet’s start with the various types of investing strategies that are out there. Granted, this is not a conclusive list of the various types of investments, but I have tried to cover the popular strategies that are out there.\n\nBefore we jump into the results, now would be the right time to explain some concepts relating to how to analyze your investments objectively.\n\na. **Cumulative Return:** It’s the total return you would have made on your invested amount. Let’s say you invested $100 and over the next two years the investment went up to $200. Then the cumulative return is 100%.\n\nb. **Rate of Return (aka annualized return):** It’s the measure of how much your investment has grown or shrunk in an annualized format. This allows us to compare investments that are active across different time periods.\n\nb. [**Sharpe Ratio**](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/07/sharpe_ratio.asp)**:** Sharpe ratio measures your investment return while making an adjustment for risk. For example, two investors A & B generate a return of 15% and 12% respectively. However, if A took much larger risks when compared to B, it may be that B has a better **risk-adjusted return**. All else equal, the higher the Sharpe Ratio, the better is your investment.\n\nc. **Max Drawdown:** This is the maximum observed loss from a peak to a subsequent bottom of the portfolio. It is an indicator of the downside risk over a specified time period. A 30% max drawdown implies that your portfolio was down 30% from its all-time high at some point during your investment period.\n\n**A quick note on how the investments are made:** I am considering an equal amount invested monthly into every strategy (Since this is the most realistic way of investing for a large majority of investors and lump-sum investing returns are heavily influenced by the starting point) \\[1\\].\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/87uprhj5zdj81.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=99c2a247bb54400f0234217d968190395d666a92\n\n**SPY and Chill**\n\nI feel that this is one of the most common types of investment out there with a person investing an equal amount into SPY every month and holding on for a long time. The basic principle behind this strategy is that the stock market as a whole will keep rising over the long period as the national economy grows. Wealth creation would be possible by just tagging along with the index rather than trying to pick and choose winners within the stock market.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kkv55rsgzdj81.png?width=1233&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d896896d6e1ec867c40f2510eee145c537de63e\n\nAs expected, just investing in SPY gave an excellent annual return of 12.3% over the last two decades. On the flip side, since your portfolio is consisting of 100% equity, you would have experienced a max drawdown of \\~40% at one point (Around the 2008 crash). The fluctuations in the portfolio value are also captured by the low Sharpe Ratio of 0.62 which showcases that you are not adequately compensated for the risk that you are taking by holding 100% equity.\n\nIn most statistical tests, it is usually required to set a base rate - To see what is the “average” rate of success. The SPY’s rate of returns and risk is usually set as the benchmark because it accounts for the bulk of “safe returns”. Any returns outside this are usually accounted to an edge, the “alpha”, and finding that edge is what beating the market is all about. \\[2\\]\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g5j37cg5zdj81.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=a596a3ea3c417089e2585df91847c50d02cb6475\n\n**Balanced Portfolio**\n\n[50&#37; Stocks. 50&#37; Bonds. Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.](https://preview.redd.it/pmq1ss4izdj81.png?width=557&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff54e80e963ba1e2a63741d08a6a8acbfbf9ccfa)\n\nThis is the type of investment strategy where you are taking a balanced approach to investment. Having a 50:50 split on stocks and bonds would definitely impact your overall returns, but you can sleep better knowing that even in the case of downturns, your portfolio is well protected.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0n2fxe1jzdj81.png?width=1327&format=png&auto=webp&s=7f2857fa8e49866b95a1ffb166f2896fa05c76c7\n\nWhile the balanced portfolio did end up giving lower returns, it’s much better in terms of the max drawdown. Your portfolio would only have had a max drop of 14% when compared to the 40% drop experienced by SPY. Adding to this, the portfolio has an excellent Sharpe Ratio of 1.35 when compared to just 0.69 of SPY during the same period.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i9uzbavjzdj81.png?width=1074&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c5fb0c713992ab8f1c69c4d81419b697b4270e8\n\nWhat’s even more interesting is that the portfolio ends up performing better than SPY during crashes\\[3\\]. As you can see from the backtest, during the financial and Covid’19 stock market crashes, your portfolio would have done much better than the market. The 2.5% CAGR \\[4\\] you are sacrificing by not going 100% in SPY is rewarded in terms of a better portfolio during the tough times.\n\n>*Harry Markowitz, the father of Modern Portfolio Theory, himself preferred the balanced strategy though his models indicated a more nuanced split. His reasoning was that it allowed him to sleep better at night.*\n\n[Link to the balanced portfolio backtest](https://app.composer.trade/symphony/Vhhi0M0jPwArFBskS258/details) \\[5\\]\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xvnj7xg5zdj81.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c4f59cf4b939ae34c0a85e8fce4c710c13bec87\n\n**Diversified Portfolio**\n\nIn this type of investment, we are looking to get a piece of all types of companies. I have considered **an equal split (33.33%)** between Large-cap, Mid-cap, and Small-cap funds.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9mubz0elzdj81.png?width=1327&format=png&auto=webp&s=40e85cda2a6d4ad2adde1a4ee1a9b221b6498570\n\nThe proposed type of diversification lessens the portfolio risk (as can be seen from max drawdown) but at the same time ends up giving a slightly lower return than purely holding the S&P 500. If you consider the Sharpe Ratio, SPY performs slightly better as you would have had similar fluctuations holding a diversified portfolio while generating slightly lower returns.\n\nI expected that the addition of Small and Mid-Cap should have generated better returns than SPY, but my hypothesis here is that the heavy concentration of tech stocks in SPY (\\~25% now) pushed the rate of return higher than that of the diversified portfolio containing small and mid-cap stocks given the recent performance of tech stocks. This brings us to the:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Tech Enthusiast**\n\nAnother one of the common strategies that has paid out handsomely over the past few decades. In this, we are allocating 100% of our monthly investments towards Nasdaq-100 (QQQ). \\[6\\]\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mcddi21nzdj81.png?width=1336&format=png&auto=webp&s=f601e9070104eb263d15dbaa59e53105f9dffcf5\n\nWell, would you look at that! Over the last 2 decades, **QQQ has returned more than double the investment return of the S&P 500**. This can be attributed predominantly to two reasons.\n\n1. Tech stocks had an amazing run due to the advances in tech as well as the availability of cheap capital after the 2007 crisis.\n2. Our starting point (2002) is heavily biased towards QQQ. It’s the lull after the 2000 dot com bubble. If we had started the same analysis in say 1990, we would have had a very different result (QQQ dropped 78% from its peak compared to only a 46% drop in SPY during the same period).\n\nHaving 100% of your investment in one sector that performed phenomenally is bound to give stunning portfolio returns. Hindsight 20/20!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ogngegh5zdj81.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=369f61976e26408e095ff061031bae173dd4a4ff\n\n**Growth Seeker**\n\nHere we are only focused on growth. Our investments are towards companies that are fast-growing. Since we are taking a higher risk on these growth stocks, we expect a higher portfolio return over the long run which is exactly what happened over the last 2 decades.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/scesx2yozdj81.png?width=1332&format=png&auto=webp&s=7acd9d8aa45191844fc7d5cf7a84dedd9c603cae\n\nBut once again this can be closely associated with investing in QQQ. I had considered Vanguard Growth ETF as my growth fund and as of today, their top 5 holdings are Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Tesla. **We are in a very rare time period where the largest companies in the world are considered to be the ones that are growing above the market rate!** Adding to this, going 100% on a growth fund gave us better risk-adjusted returns than just investing in the S&P 500.\n\n**Buying the Dip**\n\nThe idea here is simple. In this type of investing, you would not invest in the stock market and keep accumulating your cash position waiting for a crash. While this is a risky strategy, the returns do justify that investing during a crash tends to give you the best return.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7rr21twpzdj81.png?width=861&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a75fd510135fe3ed1882c452e3a532814723953\n\nI had already done an extensive analysis on Buying the dip that highlights the limitations as well as the nuances around buying the dip that is a must-read in case you are trying to replicate this strategy.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/21cqpyh5zdj81.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=8bd2120aa029a185c1054bcb904ffb0b9b18cf69\n\nPhew! That was a lot to digest for sure. As I said in the beginning, this was not about finding an investment strategy that generates the most amount of returns. This was more about finding a strategy that fits you.\n\nMaybe you are still in the SPY and Chill bucket and want the simplicity associated with your portfolio. Or maybe you were swayed by the excellent drawdown protection of the balanced portfolio or the eye-popping returns generated by tech enthusiasts. Finally, you might want to dip your toes in the crypt\\* market after seeing the 10,000%+ returns if you have an above-average tolerance for risk.\n\nWe have barely scratched the surface here and there are many more strategies out there that we haven’t covered that might be perfect for you. The idea here is that there are much better strategies (both in terms of risk-adjusted returns and max volatility) than just investing in the S&P 500. It’s up to you to find one that fits you the best!\n\nIn the immortal words of Morpheus,\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/8pwiqj600ej81.gif\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lhcg9bj5zdj81.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c395d2c3d3c5ae3e0577f40ebad10214eee2841\n\nData used in the analysis: [**Here**](https://rows.com/market-sentiment/my-spreadsheets/untitled-spreadsheet-3-6FxZVmEYa4DNdVYzn4LTZx/live)\n\nLumpsum investment backtests : ([SPY](https://app.composer.trade/symphony/OV3ohHkJ4tKA6HqqSfle/details), [Balanced](https://app.composer.trade/symphony/Vhhi0M0jPwArFBskS258/details), [Diversified](https://app.composer.trade/symphony/aXiDzYzGFlraxOVfSXtL/details), [Tech](https://app.composer.trade/symphony/BOH7t4anTqXMBc2iA78F/details))\n\n**Footnotes**\n\n**\\[1\\]** For example, in case you are considering lump-sum investing, placing the starting point in the dot-com bubble (2000) would give vastly different results than if you consider your starting point as 2002. Case in point, [CISCO stock](https://www.google.com/search?q=cisco+stock&rlz=1C5CHFA_enIN981IN981&oq=cisco+stock&aqs=chrome..69i57.2312j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) still hasn’t breached its dot-com bubble value.\n\n\\[2\\] Though there are a few other factors now that are recognized as adding minor increases to the market returns - Such as value, growth, small-cap, etc.\n\n\\[3\\] Please note that this backtest is made using a lump-sum investment and not a monthly investment. It’s more for the purpose of an insight into how holding bonds can be beneficial in case of a crash.\n\n\\[4\\] While 2.5% CAGR does seem negligible, if you look at the cumulative returns, the 100% SPY portfolio gives 293% vs the balanced portfolio only returning 192%. That’s a difference of \\~100% on your returns! Yeah, compounding is a b\\*\\*\\*h when it works against you.\n\n\\[5\\] Please note that this link is for lumpsum and not DCA.\n\n\\[6\\] I know that QQQ is not completely tech but when compared to the 23% allocation towards tech in S&P500, QQQ has more than 70%+ allocated to tech.\n\n\\[7\\] The returns here are calculated using an investment period between 2014 and 2021.", "id": "synpkf", "created_utc": 1645536751.0, "score": 1248, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 146, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|81|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|286|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/px5nt4/should_you_invest_in_the_most_reputable_brands_in/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pttfma/should_you_follow_insider_transactions_i_analyzed/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n1t0yz/i_analyzed_all_the_motley_fool_premium/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n940ns/i_analyzed_9000_trades_made_by_us_senators_in_the/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nsvma5/i_analyzed_all_the_controversial_trades_made_by/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p9c0zc/onlyfans_the_prn_empire_with_no_prn/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/synpkf/backtesting_the_most_popular_investment/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mnho9j/i_built_a_program_that_tracks_mentions_and/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbtp0q/dont_paper_hand_gme_due_to_boomer_bots_real/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/og6wr4/does_index_inclusion_positively_affect_stock/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oawsxf/i_analyzed_last_15_years_of_news_articles_to_see/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qlscp1/can_wallstreetbets_beat_the_market_i_analyzed/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oq1mv3/an_unbiased_take_on_the_robinhood_ipo_the_good/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rvuzw8/should_you_listen_to_jim_cramer_i_analyzed_20000/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qqseif/what_is_the_best_time_to_buy_an_ipo_i_analyzed/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mtehdq/i_analyzed_all_700_buy_and_sell_recommendations/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ok4l9c/i_analyzed_the_performance_of_companies_in_the/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kl4fhj/one_more_stock_indicator_to_consider_before_your/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q9yeo2/why_is_simple_dollar_cost_averaging_still_the/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o70k70/i_analyzed_the_last_3_decades_of_stock_market/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/otb1wm/a_primer_into_payment_for_order_flow_pfof/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p0esdp/do_hedge_funds_beat_the_market_i_analyzed_the/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mikm42/i_built_a_program_that_tracks_mentions_and/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/njxv95/a_dd_on_inflation_how_it_affects_stock_prices_and/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ny6wpp/i_analyzed_3600_ipos_over_the_past_two_decades_to/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p4tjye/do_actively_managed_mutual_funds_beat_the_index/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/gallery/kl4ixe) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/s1c3r3/should_you_invest_in_sustainable_companies_i/) \n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=synpkf)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=synpkf)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "My portfolio is 100% TQQQ.

Plus with market direction neutral strategy you're betting on magnitude of the move instead on the direction of the move. Which i think it's way harder to predict. At least when bad data come into play. Signal to noise ratio is a bit too low.  \n\n\nI also tried out a dynamically adjust trailing stop loss. Effectively this mean each time you get stop out, the trailing stop loss % increases by a certain amount. And adaptive trailing stop loss so to speak. These give better result than statically defined trailing stop loss %. But the hyper parameters are really unstable, so end result could change dramatically if parameters change very little. So during forward testing and live deployment might not mirror the predicted result as closely compare to a more parameters stable algorithm.

In an upside case where the Switch 2 is released by March 31, 2023, **it is reasonable to expect 15% sales growth for FY 2023.**\n* Slightly lower operating and net profit margins resulting from increased advertisement spend and R&D, offset by cost efficiency of higher software vs hardware sales mix.\n* Dividend Payout of 40% of Net Income at low end of payout ratio for the past five years.\n\n# MULTIPLES ANALYSIS\n\n|METRIC|FY 2021|Est. FY 2022|Est. FY 2023|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|EV/Revenue|2.7|2.9|2.6|\n|EV/EBITDA|7.2|8.2|7.6|\n|Debt/EBITDA|No Debt|No Debt|No Debt|\n|P/E|13.3|15.7|14.3|\n|EV/FCF|8.2|10.9|9.9|\n\n**Assumptions**\n\n* Estimates for Revenue, EBITDA, Net Income, and FCF are shown in the above Financial Analysis\n* No debt issuance (no need when 61% of balance sheet is cash)\n* Enterprise Value assumes no change in stock price\n\n# Comparables\n\n***NOTE:*** *Nintendo's comps in actuality are PlayStation, Xbox, PC, mobile, and VR. However, for purposes of this stock analysis, it is not possible to conduct a comparable analysis specific to console, PC, or mobile, as well as video game unit sales (okay maybe it's possible but fuck that, I'm not doing all that work for you degens). That stated, I instead compare NTDOY to a select few companies that savvy, totally not retarded investors such as yourselves would be likely to compare NTDOY to including ATVI, EA, SONY, RBLX, and given certain parallels relating to its incredible brand loyalty and IP expansion strategy....DIS.*\n\n*Furthermore, I am leaving out certain video game stocks including TTWO, ZNGA, and several Korean video game centered stocks based on their significantly smaller size in terms of market cap and market share as well as relevant Chinese companies because apparently nobody wants anything to do with Chinese stocks (I don't blame you).* ***This makes the following analysis wide open to counterpoints so if you have wildly differing opinions, feel free to*** ***~~shove them up your ass, find the nearest cliff, and fuck yourself~~*** ***comment below.***\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9bj0o24o3ej81.jpg?width=1004&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=344e4419dcaff7bed15ce2edd896e2cf5f7d0aab\n\nNote the substantial discount that NTDOY trades at related to all multiples aside from P/B (which is quite close). RBLX's multiples are excluded from the means shown above because they're ridiculous and would result in excessive skew for the means. We'll now apply a blended multiples valuation to calculate a PT.\n\n# VALUATION\n\nLet's use EV/Rev, EV/EBITDA, P/B, and P/E as the key metrics for our multiples valuation. We'll average the comps based multiples (excluding RBLX) and 5-year historical averages for NTDOY for a blended approach. This actually results in a lower PT compared to the PT resulting from relying solely on NTDOY's historical averages.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|VALUATION METHOD|Blended Price Target|Applied Weighting|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|EV/Rev (3.8x avg)|$86|*25%*|\n|EV/EBITDA (13.7x avg)|$103|*25%*|\n|P/B (3.5x avg)|$87|*25%*|\n|P/E (21.6x avg)|$96|*25%*|\n|**FINAL PRICE TARGET**|**$93**|*100%*|\n\n# Multiples based Price Target: $93\n\nThis PT provides a potential 48% upside when accounting for the expected 2.3% forward dividend yield. Note that this is strictly a 1-year PT since the valuation will surely change substantially over time as Nintendo opens new theme parks and continues to capitalize on its IP expansion strategy. **That said, this is a very long-term hold for me as I firmly believe that Nintendo has yet to tap into its full potential which will likely take many years.**\n\n^(Whereas the development of Metroid Prime 4 will apparently take decades...)\n\n# RISKS\n\n* **Continued Semiconductor Chip Shortage (Moderate)** \\- Could result in lower than expected production of existing Nintendo Switch consoles or *temporary* delay (*note:* ***not*** *cancellations*) of major VG releases, Super Nintendo World openings, or the Nintendo Switch 2.\n* **Execution Risk on IP Expansion Strategy (Low)** \\- Poor sales from the upcoming Super Mario Bros movie could discourage the Company from furthering its push into cinema, resulting in limited lost opportunity relating to Nintendo's long term growth.\n* **Low Trading Volume / Short Selling Risk (Moderately High)** \\- Average daily trading volume is relatively low, ranging from 300k to 400k shares. Stock price performance may be hindered by rebalancing of sizable funds (wtf Cathie Wood) or heavy short selling volume (fkn Melvin). Note that this risk does not preclude the opposite from occurring where low volume or short covering pushes the stock price upward.\n\n# \n\n# TL;DR - $93 PT for 48% 1-Yr Gain (jk, I'm holding forever)\n\n* Pokemon, The Legend of Zelda, Nintendo Switch Sports and several other popular titles expected this year are actual money printers\n* Super Nintendo World theme parks + Cinema add substantial long-term growth opportunities\n* In recent years, annualized dividend yields have been around 2%. Nintendo has paid variable semi-annual dividends since 1985--hold in taxable account if you want to reclaim a portion of the foreign dividend tax as a tax credit\n* [Remember the DK Rap?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcP91tQ4ZSM)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSources:\n\n* [Super Nintendo World](https://super-nintendo-world.usj.co.jp/en/us/home)\n* [Review of Super Nintendo World - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/22339582/super-nintendo-world-review-theme-park-japan)\n* [Highest Selling Game Consoles - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_game_consoles)\n* [Highest Grossing Video Game Franchises - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_media_franchises#cite_note-628)\n* [Top Rated Video Games of All Time - Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/browse/games/score/metascore/all/all/filtered?sort=desc)\n* [Highest Selling Mobile Games - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_mobile_games)\n* [Nintendo Ownership of Pokemon](https://zenmarket.jp/en/blog/post/10040/does-nintendo-own-pokemon)\n* [Nintendo Owned Studios - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nintendo_development_teams)\n* [Nintendo Video Game Releases for 2022 Infographic - u/ieatdragonz](https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/spa9z5/nintendo_switchs_beginning_lineup_for_2022/)\n* [MSFT Wants to Bring ATVI Games to the Switch - IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-call-of-duty-activision-blizzard-games-nintendo-switch)\n* [NTDOY Financials & Guidance FY22 - Nintendo Investor Relations](https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2022/220203e.pdf)\n* [The Difference Between Nintendo & Its Competitors](https://www.thedrum.com/news/2021/06/03/how-nintendo-leveled-up-beyond-gaming-embrace-new-platforms-and-experiences)\n* [Melvin Capital Places $400 Million Bet Against Nintendo - TIME](https://time.com/5352805/nintendo-stock-short/)", "id": "syobd1", "created_utc": 1645538478.0, "score": 2970, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 392, "comments": [{"body": "30% on NTDOY, bought in when it was $58, the only green stock on my potfolio. 😂", "score": 584, "replies": [{"body": "200 years I've been saying it - it's a damn good company", "score": 294, "replies": [{"body": "And the sheer volume of text in your post certainly proves it!", "score": 194, "replies": [{"body": "It's all about the words to linkedin pics of execs ratio", "score": 111, "replies": [{"body": "I only buy when I see 10x as many irrelevant pictures of nobody execs.

All I'd say that maybe looks a little better is the sheer number of third party games made available through the Switch compared to previous Nintendo consoles (at least recent generations). They won't compete pound for pound on specs or anything like that with Xbox or PlayStation, unless they're considerably dated, but my experience has been games like Skyrim still sold pretty well with the added portability factor. Especially when you factor in commuting gamers who have long journeys to and from work on public transport, there's utility there. I've also been relatively impressed with the ambition to port popular online games. Doesn't always work well (lol, Apex Legends) but games like Rocket League were really well done and all that is quite a new space for Nintendo to start to explore, they're far behind the online gaming front but I think they'll naturally be sucked further in. \n\nTrue enough, I agree, but I suppose one of the things that comes from both the Wii as well as the development of the Switch (and the Wii-U as effectively a beta test for the Switch) is their innovation is still pretty game changing. A lot of jealous eyes from Sony and Microsoft watching the Switch for that portable/docked dynamic (which, from my perspective, was a pretty exceptionally executed idea and product) and the Wii likewise was just such a different concept and execution. I don't hold any position in Nintendo, but one of the detractors is that they often try weird shit that doesn't come off.

Compared to the PS1 and N64, from what I've seen of US and import titles - it looks like it had better 2d stuff but mixed on 3D. The other issue too with Saturn is that even tho is actually has a rather large library of around 1000 titles- only around 300ish saw a western release so you're really reliant on imports/translations to get deep into it. But it seems pretty good. It's not covered as deeply by western reviewers because it wasn't as popular - but it even had PC ports of stuff like Warcraft 2 and rare games like Mega Man EX 3/4. \n\nDreamcast was imo probably the best of its generation. It came out 1 year prior to the PS2 in 1999. It had a built in modem, a unique controller, a mini console as a memory card. It also lacked copy protection. Sega dropped it just two years later with poor sales and failing financials after tons of lost R&D and market share. PS2 quickly outsold Dreamcast even with its 1 year later launch. \n\nHad the dreamcast stayed in the market, we could have saw some really innovative games since it's 3d stuff looked incredible with the little time it was out and it was perfectly primed for the online revolution about to take place with Xbox that Nintendo and Sony wouldn't get in on until their next console release since the PS2/GameCube only came with ports for a sold separate modem. \n\nOverall - the Saturn and Dreamcast were both really good consoles that seemed to lack the right marketing and approach to investment to maintain the success Sega had with the Genesis.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I'll never forgive them for only translating 1 fucking disc of shining force 3 for the Saturn.
