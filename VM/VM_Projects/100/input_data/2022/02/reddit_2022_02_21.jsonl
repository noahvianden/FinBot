I would have approved it, but I guess you are saying you were worried it would get removed and didn't even try? Just go ahead and post and if it is removed, just send Mod Mail to have it reviewed ASAP.\n\nAbout your question: it's hard to answer without the entire context, but I'll make a guess here based only on what you wrote. It hinges entirely on what is meant by \"implied delta strikes.\" I'll give an example and you can tell me if I'm on the right track.\n\nSuppose ATM of XYZ calls is exactly 50 delta and strikes are $1 apart. Suppose the first ITM strike and first OTM strike are 5 delta away from ATM, e.g., 55 delta and 45 delta respectively. That's our basis for comparison. Now, if instead of 5 delta, the distance between strikes was only 2 delta, like 52 and 48, that would be considered \"narrower\". If they were 10 delta apart, 60 and 40, that would be considered \"wider\".\n\nAm I making sense so far?\n\nAssuming I am, the reason is as follows. Think of the distribution of delta as a bell curve, with the center (mean) at 50 delta and the tails going off towards 0 delta and 100 delta. High volatility makes the curve squashed and wide (because the stock can swing up or down $100). Low volatility makes the curve tall and narrow (because the stock can only swing up or down $10).\n\nNow it should be clear why your discussion partner said that as atm vol rises the interval narrows. A high volatility curve has to be spread out across the chain, running from $10 to $110, which means the interval between ATM and one strike up or down is a lower number, which we already defined above as narrower. A low vol curve is like a spike around delta, maybe only from $95 at 0 delta to $105 at 100 delta, so the interval is wider, there is more \"delta\" per $1 strike.\n\nYou can see this with arithmetic. If 0 delta is $10 and 100 delta is $110 (high vol), there is $100 difference between those tails and you need to fit 100 points of delta into that curve, so 100/100 = 1 point of delta per dollar of strike. But if 0 delta was $95 and 100 delta is $105 (low vol), there is only $10 difference between those tails and you need to fit 100 points of detail into that curve, so 100/10 = 10 points of delta per dollar of strike.\n\nSince 1 point is less than 10 points, the high vol case is narrower than the low vol case.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Hello, I hope everyone is well, how does the relationship work with respect to earnings and the increase in option premiums due to the increase in its volatility, when are the best times to buy calls or puts?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "There are no best times.  \n\nMany traders avoid earnings, both before and after, by a number of days.  \n\nSome traders play for increases in implied volatility value before earnings, some trade for its decline after earnings.

One is about all stocks in general, and two is about GME and other meme stocks specifically, since the answers are very different.\n\nFor normal underlyings, break-even strategies aren't usually a good idea. Your question is equivalent to, is it okay if I lose 6.5k as long as I make 6.6k? In other words, is it okay if I take on a very large risk and only make $100 in payoff after over a year? Even if we say worst-case risk is total loss of 6.5k (it's actually higher than that, since the short leg could blow up), a $100 return on $6500 is a measly 1.5% annualized. You can do a lot better over a whole year with a lot less risk. Now, if the probability of total loss is low and the probability of making many times $100 is high, it might be worth doing. Like even if you lose 6.5k, you stand to gain 10x that amount more than 50% of the time, it's worth it.\n\nFor GME and meme stocks in general, it's always a bad idea. The more capital you sink into a long delta, long vega, short theta position (a far expiration call), the more volatility you are exposing that capital to. That's not the most effective way to play volatility. Instead, consider shorter holding times, like less than 30 days, and defined-risk strategies, like vertical spreads. Vertical spreads net vega and theta close to zero, as long as you keep the spread width narrow. Or go pure gamma with a 0 DTE straddle or strangle.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I appreciate the response. Ill need to look into more some other strategies, I have liked the look of spreads they're quite appealing.\n\nBut I'm still kinda interested in this PMCC so I'll make a bit more specific And what my game plan is. Also note that this my risky/play money, obviously I don't wanna lose it, but it's not gonna hurt me if I do.\n\nI buy the leap I mentioned, I would sell around January of February of next year, my thoughts on GME is that it'll hold 100ish this year but I would set a stop loss at 90$ and my long position would take a hit of around ~3.2k. I'm fairly confident I can make that within 4-6 months.\n\nAlso, you mentioned you can lose more then the entry cost cause the short leg can blow up? I'm not following you there, my understanding of this is the short leg can't blow up because of the leap and my stop loss but rather just has a capped profit", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "What are the best books to learn iron condors and selling calls?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Books?

In November 21, the fed announced that it would begin tapering asset purchases in December. They did and have since doubled the rate of taper and stated that they will begin raising interest rates in March, once the taper is complete. So far, they've stuck to their word on this.\n\nMany market participants believe the fed will taper and perhaps even raise rates, but will then bail and turn the money hose back on if the market starts to tank. Recent episodes (over the last decade) did go this way. Personally, I believe that \"this time is different\".\n\nThe evidence for this is the rising inflation as reported in the [CPI](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=LWoe), PCE, PPI and other metrics. We have the highest inflation since the 1970's, by some measures. \n\nIf you then believe that the fed will actually do its job and fight inflation, the least you would suspect is that they will raise interest rates a decent amount through several rate hikes over at least the next year or two. If rates then continue to rise past maybe 3 or 4 percent, as was necessary with high inflation in the 70's and 80's, equity valuations will continue to fall (stonks will go down). Or, if the fed surprises the market with \"excessive\" tightening measures, it is presumed this would also potentially cause a significant crash.\n\nWithout the easy money support, you then fall back on actual fundamentals and valuations based on financial performance. The S&P 500 [CAPE](https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe) ratio (currently 35.59) has only ever been higher during the dotcom bubble. The historical average is around 17.\n\nSo my perception is that the bull run you described from the last 8 years was part of the low interest / excessive liquidity mayhem provided by the fed. I believe that era is ending presently due to high inflation. Without the easy money, i believe valuation multiples will continue to collapse. I think if you're buying the S&P at a CAPE of 36, basically your only prayer of profiting in the next decade or so (ignoring \"bear market rallies\" and other temporary events) is if the fed fully reverses their current monetary stance.\n\n[Current Market Valuation](http://currentmarketvaluation.com) is an interesting site for more info on the current market valuation.

The proper interpretation here isn’t necessarily that the S&P 500 will collapse by 72% from its highs. Rather, the implication is that investors should not expect durable, long-term S&P 500 total returns anywhere near 10% annually until valuations approach those norms. \n\n- if we examine the times in U.S. history when 10-year CPI inflation averaged even 4% annually, S&P 500 valuations at the end of those 10-year periods were always at or below their historical norms – on average more than 30% below those norms.\n\n- Low interest rates can certainly encourage yield-seeking speculation in stocks, driving their valuations higher, and their expected future returns lower.\n\n- Indeed, until the S&P 500 drops below about 2600, I would consider even a Treasury bond yielding 2% to be a higher-return, lower-risk proposition than the S&P 500. (I appreciate the boldness of a direct prediction here!)\n\n- Given that government deficits in the coming quarters are projected to contract further, the combination of smaller deficits and a diminished reservoir of household savings may place surprisingly strong downward pressure on corporate profits in the quarters ahead.\n\n- we should expect corporate profit margins to move inversely with real unit labor costs (unit labor cost/output price).\n\n- It’s clear is that Fed easing amplifies speculation. During the recent bubble, we learned the hard way that, faced with the novelty of zero interest rates, yield-seeking speculation can go beyond any historically reliable limit but it’s also important to recognize that even in recent years, Fed easing has not reliably supported stocks during periods when investor psychology has shifted toward risk-aversion.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah I love what Hussman has to say, and it all pretty much seems to be backed up by the statistical analysis.

The larger story is the failure of the JIT manufacturing and stock system (there's an argument that there are good and bad implementation of Just In Time systems for stock, and that's true, but they all have weaknesses like what I'm about to describe, but the difference is in how vulnerable the chain is in a change in interest).\n\nBasically, keeping a bunch of stock undermines business interests by driving up costs and keeping prices down, so pretty much every major supplier (not just in cars) uses a JIT (Just In Time) stock system that seeks to keep active stock as low as possible while still maintaining sales volume.\n\nThis works out great until something like a pandemic rolls along and cuts buying for 6-12 months and then you see a massive spike once the condition which caused the buying slowdown to turn around, which is exactly what happened in 2020. So the JIT market ses a downturn, cuts orders, cuts production, etc... then tries to scale up once demand comes back. In Capitalist Economics this is called \"market efficiency.\" \n\nNow if you're a profiteer, this is great because cutting supply and then seeing a huge demand increase gives you buying power. If you're a consumer or care about the health of the market or the country or the people, this sucks. But Capitalism doesn't exist to solve those other problems... just to make profit, so this is basically a great example of how Capitalism solves problems:\n\nIt doesn't. Problems are something other people solve. \n\nAnyway, since all the buying and ordering is happening in the midst of a gap-up in demand, in the JIT system the fact that demand gapped down is taken into account variably. If a car dealership, for instance, is convinced that it won't slow down, then orders remain up and car prices will remain up with it.\n\nBut the market for cars is finite, and right now the differential in used car prices (up 40+% year over year) is much greater than the price differential for new cars (up 12%). This has given people a pretty good opportunity to change out used cars at a premium for an upgrade if what they want is in stock. In May of 2021 I sold a 10 year old used car with over $5,000 in work that needed to get done for basically $8,000 in direct cash and incentives. In a normal market I'd be lucky to get $2,000 for that car, but they threw money at me just to get access to the used car because they could make another 50% off of it easy. The car I bought new is actually worth more now than it was when I bought it LOL.\n\nEventually that'll turn around and when it does, the JIT system will likely fail to reverse course quickly enough just like it failed during the pandemic, meaning that there's a period of time when orders will be up and inventories will likely be up in \\*some\\* sectors of the market relative to where they would have been in a normal market... so yes, expect that when the situation reverses, it'll probably be a disinflationary event.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Holy shit.
