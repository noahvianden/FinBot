I appreciate everyone's gracious answers yesterday when I asked why no one has created the ability to crowdsource options to effectively create nanos on everything. Unfortunately... all of the objections I heard just made it seem like a better idea to me. So beat down round 2 I guess. \n\n**# 2 questions:**\n\n1. Is this the right place to ask this question, or is there a better place?\n2. If this is an ok place to ask, then please shred my actual idea. :-)\n\n**# Idea: Crowdsource options the way people get together in an office pool to buy lottery tickets**\n\nYes, I do appreciate that I'm starting by using an analogy that screams stupid investor. But it's just an analogy that I thought would make it immediately clear what I'm proposing.\n\nThe idea seems really simple. You just get people who are interested in buying an option contract, but who don't want or can't afford all 100 shares. And go in to buy it together.\n\nThis TSLA contract https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA220211C00200000?p=TSLA220211C00200000 is $6,250 right now. If I could buy just 1 of those 100 options, it'd be 625. If I could buy 1/4, it'd be $156. \n\n**# Why Would I want This**\n\n**## Scenario 1 - Speculation**\n\n$6,250 is more than I'd want to risk. $156 puts it in the realm where I might change my mind though. \n\n**## Scenario 2 - Locking in Gains **\n\nI actually own a fair bit of TSLA. It's utterly stupid where the stock is IMO. The music surely will stop at some point, but I don't know when. If I could buy a put against the number of shares I own, then I could essentially \"reserve\" a buyer for the length of that option contract.\n\n**## Scenario 3 - Avoiding Losses**\n\nSame mechanic as above, but different motivation. Suppose I'm retired / retiring, and I want exposure to the upsides of this nutty market, but can't afford to lose my principal. I could use the same strategy of buying puts to cap my downside\n\n**# Problems**\n\n**## Exercising**\n\nThe main problem is just that you can only exercise the whole contract at once. Either everyone agrees that the contract is not to be exercised until expiration, or you set up some kind of voting mechanism such that once a certain fraction of the ownership wants to exercise, it is exercised. And then the disbursements are made.\n\n**## Liquidity**\n\nPresumably, once you get into the contract, you're kinda stuck with it til exercising happens. (see above). I guess you could try and sell your share to someone else or something, but that's more complicated and I haven't really thought it through. I think for just a small group, you'd either just work out a sale w/ someone else in the pool, or just deal with the lack of liquidity.\n\n**## Choosing A Specific Contract / Herding The Cats**\n\nSo there are lots of contracts for each ticker out there. And so there'd be some challenge in getting enough people interested in the specific terms desired to fill the contract. And then some mechanism to let the purchase \"fill up\" without having to go back and forth asking \"You still in at $X?\" Seems like a site where people could input an order and a maximum bid and expiration date would be able to sort that out though.\n\n**## Objections From Yesterday**\n\n1. I was told that I should not be undercapitalized to use options. But this solves that objection by reducing the capital put at risk to be in line w/ budgetary constraints.\n2. Who's backing the options - Well, there's a \"real\" option contract under this already. So it's already backed in the same way. It'd just be a matter of trusting whoever was administering things. I guess in an office pool you kinda know everyone. I haven't thought this through yet either, but it seems like a problem that's been solved countless times in other venues already. So just have to find one. Note: I'm assuming this would just include the buying of puts / calls. Not the selling. So margin requirements shouldn't be a concern. Money comes in and is used to buy a thing. And once it's sold, those proceeds are disbursed. \n3. You can do spreads of various types already. Fair enough. But these strategies cap your upside, are complicated, and frankly are just a lousy workaround for what looks like a market inefficiency. This isn't necessarily idea relative to being able to just buy 1lot contracts, but better than spreads.\n4. Expenses - The primary expense if this were an actual business would I guess being in the administration, and in whatever was required to guarantee that the administrator was going to do what they said they would do. But if this was just a friends thing like the office pool, I dunno it just seems like someone with a spreadsheet.\n\nThoughts?", "score": -1, "replies": [{"body": "Whatever you do be sure to get a good lawyer . . .", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "> If I could buy just 1 of those 100 options, it'd be 625.

The further out you go, the more expensive the call or put will be, all else equal.

Say you buy a call for $1.00 and want at least a 10% gain but don't want to lose more than 20%. That makes your profit target $1.10 and your loss limit is $0.80, easy. All that is left is the max holding time, for when you don't hit either your profit target or your loss limit. Holding too long costs you money, to theta decay and opportunity cost, which is why a max holding time is necessary.\n\nSo if you open a 30 DTE call, you would plan to exit at some DTE closer to expiration. According to our [When to Exit Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/pages/whentoexit), you can hold a long call up to 12 DTE, to avoid the worst part of the theta decay curve. If you haven't reached your modest profit target by then, you probably never will with this contract. That said, the higher the profit target, the longer you may have to hold. For example, if you want a 50% gain, it might make sense to hold until 4 DTE, the Monday before a Friday's expiration, but you risk losing a lot more to theta decay holding that long.

That would imply that the contract is in a down trend, since the last trade is above the bid/ask.\n\n> Is the 0.180 the premium for every single share or contract?\n\nAll prices quoted in an option chain are per share, just like with stocks.

There is no global authority stating the \"fair value\" of each contract, so that you can instantly know if it is over or under priced.

High IV suggests the market is overvaluing premium on the contract, low IV suggests the market is undervaluing premium on the contract.

I continued researching and I found out the direction things were going is that Intel missed smart phones blowing up, which Apple kicked off around 2007-8, so they didn't have a flagship chip optimized for mobile available to sell. \n\nIt takes about 5 years to go from R&D to mass production of chips. That meant it'd have been 2015-16-ish at the soonest before they'd have a competitive product if everything went well, and they'd had a not so great generation of processors recently. And then by mid-decade, smart phone processors would be more like commodities, and other companies' chips would be in 2nd or 3rd generation by then, so not a huge amount of money to be made. So Intel wouldn't be having another Pentium situation with smartphones.\n\nThe stock I bought, the price went down after that for a few months and then started rising again and I sold it when it came back to the price I'd bought it at. I learned a very good lesson about research before I get involved with a company and it didn't cost me much in the end.\n\nVerizon--I'm a long term customer of theirs and haven't ever had problems so I like them too. It's been on my shortlist for a few years. Looks like the stock has been largely horizontal the last several years.\n\nOn top of that I work at a utility and the utility industry is switching to smart meters. Smart meters communicate to consolidator-type equipment and those have cell modems inside them and send all the meter reading data back to the utility servers over cell data. That means other companies' data is moving thru telecom networks. Seems like the business idea is to build a network then fit as much usage onto it as possible and charge everyone tolls. There being more and more smart devices and cell connections all the time seems like this should be a gold mine.\n\nSounds like a good idea to get involved with--the thing about not being a prospector but being the store on the way the prospectors buy their equipment at. On top of this, it makes sense to me that eventually people's internet at their houses will be largely wireless back to a tower rather than running fiber everywhere, since the most expensive part of a fiber network is the service drop to each house so doing wireless off towers will be cheaper.\n\nIt turns out the cell companies don't own most of the towers, they just lease them from other companies. Additionally, utilities are starting to build their own private cell networks so the trend will be toward in-housing the wireless data in the next generation of metering infrastructure. On top of that, Starlink is going to eat into the wireless business to remote and rural locations.

So far Google has been pretty good about ads not coming across as obnoxious. \n\nMy attitude/philosophy with keeping all of my money tied in Google and Microsoft is that on paper they seem “risky” because it’s owning one stock. However, the only way holding just these two is financially risky is if they have an Enron-level situation that causes their share value to plummet.

{"title": "Why the FED is the only thing that matters!", "selftext": "I'm here to make sure you don't have a good night of sleep for the next several months. Macro economists like \"David Hunter\" have made bold predictions that we're going to see a parabolic melt up to SPX $6,000 at the end of this bull market run, and I'm here to tell you why that not only won't happen, but that we're about to see SPY, QQQ,  IWM enter a bear market.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst, we need to understand an assumption about the money supply. That is, there is NO money on the \"sidelines\"\n\nFor example:  If I hold cash in my bank account, that money is lent out to others from the bank which is exchanged for goods and services. That exchange of cash deposited in another's bank account which may then be used to purchase stocks, bonds, etc. The other party receives cash and places it in their bank account. (cycle repeats) \n\n If we can assume that all of the money is *fully invested* (see assumption above), then what matters is the *\"composition of assets.\"*\n\nWe see this happen already when money flows from one sector to the next. It can also happen between asset classes, like stocks to bonds or vice-versa. Over the last decade, it has been a free-for-all search for yield. The FED keeping rates near 0.00% has influenced investors to purchase risk assets like equities, trading cards, jpegs, leveraged ETF's, & other dogshit (and sometimes on margin). The point being, cash has been trash, bonds don't provide much % interest, and the only way to grow wealth was to yolo your whole account in meme stocks.\n\nNow that the FED has decided to shut off liquidity and begin rate hikes, there will be a huge shift in the *composition of assets* (not to mention, the money supply stopping/potentially reversing if the FED rolls off their balance sheet = growth in $SPX is gone). Safer assets like bonds/treasuries will have a higher % return with a lower cost of capital than growth stocks. Money will rotate from these risk assets to safer\\* assets. It's not a question of \"if\", but a question of \"when\", and with valuations so high, you'd think its probably sooner rather than later? Who wants to be left holding the jpeg bags? \n\nThis process will have a negative impact on the overall equity market, but it will more than likely destroy 0% returning assets, growth stocks, memes, dogshit companies, etc. \n\nSome may counter this viewpoint with: \"The Economy and company earnings are the best they've ever been!\" to which I would say, if a company is setting record profits today, is it more or less likely to post record profits next quarter?\n\nIf you don't believe me yet, think about how $120/bn month was printed since the Covid Crash Bottom and where we are now. Ask yourself, what happens when the FED isn't IN the market propping it up?\n\ntldr;  JPOW is the boogeyman that lives under bull's mattresses. The stock market is not the economy.

{"title": "TSLA and a tale of two boomers", "selftext": "Sharing my general investment thesis because I think looking at history gives a unique perspective that many people glance past when they’re diving deep into the weeds. For this example I am going to completely ignore financial analysis and look at the things which are more difficult to quantify. \n\n**Introduction** \n\nI know that many bulls agree that Tesla will be the biggest stock and most disruptive company of all time so let’s take a peek at the most recent example. I believe that Tesla is in a similar position today to where Apple was about 2-3yr after they released the iPhone (10-12yr ago).\n\nBefore we go comparing apples to oranges I’d like to argue that I believe they are really the same as they both disrupted established industries by using a strategy of combining great hardware with software expertise to reinvent an existing product.\n\nApple released the iPhone in 2007 into a crowded market filled with various cellphones which were sold by established competitors yet the products were mostly garbage. There was tremendous FUD by mainstream media and various hit-pieces about why Apple won’t stand a chance against the existing competition and how consumers won’t want a phone with a touchscreen etc. [https://macdailynews.com/2007/01/10/the\\_massive\\_fud\\_campaign\\_against\\_apples\\_iphone/](https://macdailynews.com/2007/01/10/the_massive_fud_campaign_against_apples_iphone/) \n\n**Competition is Coming**\n\nIn 2008 as the iPhone slowly gained popularity we began to see a shift from competitors where they decided to make smartphones to compete against Apple. The news rang loudly that they would catch up soon and crush Apple. Here is a slideshow deck from a quarterly earnings presentation by Nokia. [http://disruptiveinnovation.se/wp-content/uploads/Nokia4.png](http://disruptiveinnovation.se/wp-content/uploads/Nokia4.png) \n\nWe can see that they decided instead of using the Apple strategy of focusing all energy into making one really great product with high-margins they’d rather make a bunch of mediocre products with low-margins. GM is currently using a very similar strategy by promising to make 30 new EV models when they still haven’t perfected a single one yet (see Chevy Bolt). \n\nIn 2009 Tim (COO at the time) is interviewed about how there is a ton of competition coming with dozens of new phones coming out to catch up to them. His response is that “They’re still catching up with the first iPhone we’ve moved beyond that”. This is a very clear similarity of how the pace of innovation is what truly matters and that Tesla is in a similar point where competitors are trying to catch up with the original Model 3 while Tesla has moved far beyond that point in terms of product development for future releases. [https://techcrunch.com/2009/10/19/apple-on-its-iphone-competitors-theyre-still-catching-up-to-the-first-iphone/](https://techcrunch.com/2009/10/19/apple-on-its-iphone-competitors-theyre-still-catching-up-to-the-first-iphone/) \n\nAnother year or so goes by and the industry realizes that Apple isn’t just in the phone business but that they are also in the software business. They adjust their strategy with a reactive instead of proactive approach again to continue playing catchup. Notice that they finally included a touchscreen after claiming nobody wants one, and also attempted to do music/apps/etc. Legacy auto is currently at this stage now where they haven't really completed the first step of making nice EV's but are hyping up software buzzwords. [http://disruptiveinnovation.se/wp-content/uploads/Nokia10.png](http://disruptiveinnovation.se/wp-content/uploads/Nokia10.png) \n\n**A Cult of Personality**\n\nIn terms of the product ecosystem Apple has been noted as having a cult following of people who evangelize their products. This cult of personality has also rippled from their notably eccentric CEO Steve Jobs throughout pop-culture and through their retail investor community. We know that Wall Street hates unpredictability and likes things which are easy to analyze and fit into a certain category. \n\nTesla clearly mirrors this wild cult-like behavior from top to bottom, and arguably to an even greater extreme given Musk’s social media behavior. Both of these companies have been known for being the red-headed stepchild of Wall Street due to always thinking and behaving outside the box.\n\n**A Tale of Two Boomers**\n\nMany people say hindsight is usually 20/20 however I’d like to offer unique example of attempting to hone the skill of foresight. To present this I will offer a tale of two boomers I’m fortunate enough to know, followed up by a personal experience of mine.\n\nMeet Bob, he’s your average late 50’s guy that likes to watch CNBC and talks about movement in the DOW in terms of points instead of percentages. One of the coolest family members of mine, great guy with an interesting story. \n\nBob purchased $AAPL in 1993 for around $14 ($0.31 split adjusted) and sold it around 6 months later for $19 per share ($0.42 split adjusted) which was a modest gain for holding under a year. Obviously we can see that if he would have just held he’d be laughing all the way to the bank. However he is your average retail investor that buys random stock in random companies he doesn’t fully understand and hasn’t ever done enough research to develop the conviction to hodl.\n\nMeet Mike, he’s your average late 50’s guy that likes to play guitar and go fishing. His first job out of college in the early 1980’s would fly him around for work and he randomly got upgraded to first class free one day on a nearly empty flight heading from San Francisco to LA. He struck up conversation with two guys named Steve and Steve who thought he may have been wealthy since he was in first class and tried to pitch him on investing in their computer company named after a fruit. Yes that’s right it was Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak… He politely declined as he was broke and just recently graduated from college, yet reminisces of the pleasant conversation they had that day.\n\nSeveral years later he ended up getting an Apple IIC desktop computer and reflected on his conversation on that flight while he enjoyed using his new computer at work. Over the next few years he began to slowly pick up a few shares of Apple stock as he could afford to but he never had a huge disposable income as he was raising a family and working an average job. Over the next 10yrs through the ups and downs he continued slowly buying because he kept enjoying their new products. Many years have since gone by and his small position has grown into a sizable one which enabled him to achieve waterfront living in South Florida and early retirement. \n\nAbout 2 years ago Mike purchased a Tesla Model 3 Performance and when I asked him how he liked it he instantly began raving about how amazing it is. He also mentioned how it reminded him of when he got his Apple IIC back in the day. Mike even stated to me that he believes Tesla is on a similar path to the one Apple took and that he began converting some of his AAPL holding to begin accumulating TSLA after he got acquainted with the product.\n\n**Muh P/E Ratio**\n\nOne of the common things people say when analyzing a growth company is “The P/E ratio is too high”. P/E looks backwards at old earnings which is what should be used if you’re evaluating a boomer company with cashflows that aren’t growing much.  \n\nBy looking backwards instead of forward everything will look overpriced because you aren’t factoring in future earnings growth. Looking at only the P/E ratio has caused many people to miss out on the best growth stories of all time. Remember the articles when AMZN had a P/E of 1200 a few years ago? Bet you wish you bought then…\n\nForward P/E ratio and PEG ratio are the two metrics you should be using. I promised this post wouldn’t be about numbers so do a quick google search on these sometime. \n\nMaybe do some research on TSLA’s operating leverage and gross margins if you really want to dive deep ;) \n\nOnce you understand Forward P/E and PEG ratio you’ll see that TSLA is currently undervalued. \n\n**Conclusion**\n\nMany people have done great work on DCF models and attempting to value Tesla, but I believe that other factors are hard to forecast when looking further past a 5 year time horizon. I think that things will continue to surprise people and disruptive innovation is extremely difficult to quantify. \n\nMy general thesis is that TSLA in 2022 is similar to AAPLin 2009 but with a waaayyyyyy larger TAM, curious to see how things play out :)\n\nPositions: Literally all in on TSLA June 2023 $1000C's, January 2024 $1000C's and January 2024 $1200C's", "id": "sme854", "created_utc": 1644199222.0, "score": 361, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 423, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|187|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|3 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=sme854)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=sme854)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "When people start upgrading the model 3 yearly and buying their 12 year old a plaid for Christmas I'll reevaluate the comparison to Apple.

(*Congrats on the post-mortem brilliance. You guys are real fucking geniuses by the way.*)\n\nIn regards to the bear case, let’s suffice it to say that yeah, Facebook and ol Zuck could have a bad year or two.\n\nBut if you were ever going to stop yoloing dailies for a few days and actually take a long term position in your life, you’d be an absolute smooth brain not to try to scoop up some meta for your retirement.\n\nInstead of puking bullshit about forward P/E, Daily Active Users, revenue per users, time spent in app, and some subjective opinion about whether or not we are going to live with screens on our faces, let’s just talk about Mark.\n\nMy position is pretty simple. **Mark Zuckerberg is a once in a generation CEO and you are simply misinformed if you do not see it**.\n\nSure he may not come across as the most charismatic Chad out there, and he may not have funny tweets. Perhaps is sense of fashion is shitty. Maybe he does need a better hair cut. And he should probably get some more media training before he testifies in front of congress again.\n\nBut the man is a fucking super genius and has a proven track record of being ridiculously competent.\n\nHe is literally **on a trajectory to be the most successful human being in the history of American capitalism**.\n\nHe isn’t even middle aged, and he has already achieved as much as - or MORE than - every other billionaire out there.\n\nLet’s take a moment and compare the ages of some major achievers to Mr. Zuckerberg.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Elon Musk** \\- Age 50 - Sold PayPal at 30, started SpaceX at age 31 became CEO of Tesla at age 37\n* **Jeff Bezos** \\- Age 58 - Founded Amazon.com at age 30\n* **Warren Buffett** \\- Age 91 - Publicly listed Berkshire Hathaway at age 32\n* **Sundar Pichai** \\- Age 49 - Hired as CEO of Google at age 42\n* **Tim Cook** \\- Age 61 - Became CEO of Apple at age 50\n* **Steve Jobs** \\- Deceased - Invented the iPod at age 46, iPhones at age 52\n* **Bill Gates** \\- Age 66 - Released Windows 95 and took the PC world by storm at age 41.\n* **Jen-Hsun Huang** \\- Age 58 - Co-founded Nvidia at age 30\n* **Lisa Su** \\- Age 52 - Became AMD CEO at age 44.\n* **Mark Cuban** \\- Age 63 - Sold broadcast.com and became a billionaire at age 40\n* **JK Rowling** \\- Age 56 - Published Harry Potter at 32\n* **Oprah Winfrey** \\- Age 68 - Started Oprah Winfrey show at age 32\n* **Jamie Dimon** \\- Age 65 - Became CEO of JPMorgan Chase at age 52\n\nAs you can see, pretty much all of these people didn’t even start their path to major success until their 30’s or later.\n\nAnd I did not just cherry pick old CEO’s and famous people. This is the story for pretty much everyone who is ultra successful. I mean, look at the dinosaurs who have climbed their way up DC to run America.\n\nI digress.\n\n# Mark Zuckerberg - Age 37 - Founded Facebook at age 20. 1 billion users by age 26. Launched Meta at age 37.\n\nNewsflash fuckwads. Zuckerberg is young enough to be friends with Justin Bieber.\n\nIn terms of age, Mark Zuckerberg surpassed the business success of all those other leaders at an age when they were all still going to college parties and trying to get laid.\n\nToday, Zuckerberg is arguably one of the most important people on Earth, his company influences politics and global affairs to an extent that would have given Julius Caesar a 3-day hardon.\n\nFacebook is so big and powerful than American legislators are literally - and rightfully - afraid of it’s influence on your mind.\n\nAnd this was NOT an accident. I don’t care that the idea for his website came from those Winklefucks. Using the internet to have people interact and post photos with people was NOT a unique concept at the time. There were ENDLESS website and communities trying do this very same thing in the early 2000s. I remember, because unlike all you TikTokin zoomers, I was alive and there:\n\n* MSN\n* MySpace\n* Nexopia\n* Friendster\n* Hi5\n* Second Life\n* Photobucket\n* Forums\n* Chatrooms\n* AND MILLIONS OF SHITTY SEGMENTED ONLINE COMMUNITIES MADE IN HTML\n\nBut guess what? At the ripe old age of 23, Mark Zuckerberg saw the trend and built Facebook out from basically nothing. *His* website is the one that took over the world, *not* all those others that were trying and had limitless access to capital via the dot com bubble.\n\nHe essentially pioneered social media, which is now the dominant cultural medium in our world.\n\nHe did it once, and there's a reasonably good chance he can do it again.\n\nAnd all these little children in the world have spent the formative years of their childhood LIVING on screens. They will flock to a metaverse when it is developed.\n\nIf you look at a comparison in career between Zuck and Musk, **Zuck is pretty much at the life stage where Musk was when he was rich from PayPal and thinking about Tesla and SpaceX**.

The REASON FB was successful was because there was no stable competition. also that pioneered bit is factually false. Myspace was the groundwork for social media. It was poised to succeed but failed because of poor business decisions and stagnation, even with a MASSIVE jump start compared to FB. You try to downplay this by lumping it with all the other alternatives, but the point is that myspace was making many of the same moves facebook was, but was bogged down with those poor decisions squandering what should have been reinvested profits. They were faux competition which is why they fell by the wayside.\n\nThe reason it's so important that the Winklevoss twins started it is that all Mark had to do was not fuck up. he didn't have to succeed or push for any innovation. Just hire the right people and don't let any morals bog down his money chasing. Now, yes, that's certainly some good qualities for the CEO of an amoral multi billion dollar information hoarding empire, but it is not enough for someone to build a new empire.\n\nZuckerberg will likely succeed again, but not as unequivocally as he did with facebook and even that future success is uncertain. Zuckerberg has never had real competition to deal with. By the time anyone came to challenge Facebook he was already established. Because the social media industry was lightning in a bottle, there's such an astronomical unlikelyhood he'll EVER be the one to jump on an industry like this again. These past few years have been the first time he's had to go toe to toe with real competition, and now we see how well that's turned out.\n\nYou're focusing so hard on his age, but that's an indication that his success DID NOT STEM FROM FUNDAMENTAL EXPERIENCE OR KNOWLEDGE. It stemmed from the situation and opportunity, and while it shows he can grab opportunity when presented, it does not indicate any empire-building skills outside of the bare minimum which a surprising number of people have, they just lack the opportunity and privilege Mark had.\n\nAnd there is absolutely no way he is getting back into the social media game, his home turf, if FB stagnates out of the market. Social media is unimaginably fickle and success changes with the breeze as it inherently follows social trends and fads, which are temporary (another reason myspace found itself struggling as it had gone out of fashion, even with the same progressions). Betting on one CEO in social media would be like betting on a single number on a roulette table, there is nothing that number has that will make it any more likely than the other 35 to be hit.\n\nLong story short, Zuckerberg's age is a hinderence to your argument, proving he was a lesser factor than the other mentioned billionaires. He captured lightning in a bottle and has no proven *personal* track record of success, and betting on him is more akin to betting on his money and those around him. Still a better play than lighting your money on fire, but it's not remiss to shit on him in the long term and not expect FB, nor his immediate business ventures to thrive.

That is, an all in one communication platform that aimed to completely take control of online social communication, rather than individual niches such as friendster. Even blackplanet, the true origin of social media, was more limited in its scope on what communication it was aiming to provide. Myspace was the first platform to want it all which FB then chased and surpassed, something that has ironically fallen out of favor with social media platforms as front facing niche/trendy communication with broad socialization has become the big ticket (think tiktok, insta/snap, twitter, etc).\n\nIt had an absolutely huge leap ahead of FB.

By 2009 the loss was obvious and by 2011 myspace was become history.\n\nAnd as far as zuck, I still stand by that. Facebook has never undergone any radical redirection. it's stayed the course and added on logical additions. Any major addons have been preestablished companies like snapchat. That along with winklevoss being the original platform idealists means there's nothing there that indicates Mark actually looked into unique business strategies. I'm not saying he can't run a major company, obviously he can. But the idea that he can build a new company from scratch is, in my opinion, a big stretch.

Of all the times we’ve been doing poorly economically speaking, this is definitely not one of it, relatively speaking. The situation is shit for everyone. Tourism is not as big as a source of income as it is for Spain for example, besides, Florence is already packed with tourists (first hand informations), so it’s alright.

Sono però abbastanza sicuro sul fatto che l’Italia non avrà una crisi del debito nel breve termine, nel giro di un paio di anni. Ci sono troppi fattori che si stanno muovendo nella nostra direzione al momento. Che la situazione sia peggio del 2019 penso sia da dare per scontato, ma pure per gli altri è così, non siamo mica noi ad essere un’anomalia al momento, nessuno o quasi si sta riprendendo dal lockdown più velocemente di noi. I commercianti italiani sono stati disintegrati dalla pandemia, dal lockdown, e dal fatto che anche senza lockdown la gente bene o male va in giro meno, e lì purtroppo non ci può fare niente nessuno. Negli altri paesi la situazione è stata esattamente la stessa, con la differenza che partivano da situazioni di debito migliori, magari con meno turismo e meno piccoli commercianti o ristoratori/albergatori da aiutare, e quindi hanno potuto aiutare un po’ di più le categorie più colpite. Noi col debito alle stelle cosa avremmo dovuto fare esattamente? Anche lasciando tutto aperto, la gente mica ci sarebbe entrata come prima nei negozi e nei ristoranti, e già prima la situazione era poco bella. Mi dispiace ma i commercianti italiani si sono trovati in una situazione di merda e basta, possono essere incazzati con il mondo o con la vita, ma io in negozio ci vado meno di prima a prescindere da lockdown o meno, compro tutto online perché le cose costano meno, e francamente o i commercianti si adattano o sono destinati a chiudere bottega. Altrimenti si finisce come con Alitalia, a dare sussidi costosissimi a fondo perduto a una categoria perennemente in grave perdita, perché il mercato semplicemente è cambiato e devono adattarsi anche loro, è inutile voler sbattere la testa contro il muro sperando che un giorno cada, bisogna cambiare approccio o cambiare mestiere. C’è troppa gente senza un sito web, senza ecommerce, senza pubblicità, senza un pos nel 2022. Non scherziamo, prendersela col governo è la cosa più facile, ma il problema è ben più complesso, è proprio la mentalità e la struttura del paese a non essere adatta a un contesto globale. Mi dispiace soprattutto per i ristoratori e albergatori che avevano fatto grossi investimenti e si sono ritrovati con pochi clienti ed energia alle stelle (questa secondo me a breve si sistema), lì purtroppo bisogna solo sperare che la situazione torni alla normalità il prima possibile, anche se secondo me ci vorranno ancora anni per un recupero totale.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Draghi ha praticamente il potere assoluto, ma non ha colpe!

Idee diametralmente opposte su tutto a prescindere, e totale incapacità di trovare una mediazione. Il famoso tentativo di “cambiamento” dei M5S è stata la cosa più ridicola che si sia mai vista, si sono rivelati come (e peggio) di tutti gli altri, perché oltre all’attaccamento morboso alla poltrona che accomuna tutti i politici si è aggiunta anche la mancanza di esperienza e troppo spesso competenza. Ogni volta che l’opposizione vince le elezioni disfa regolarmente tutti i provvedimenti cardine del governo precedente, anzi sono proprio questi solitamente i cavalli di battaglia della campagna elettorale. Ti giuro, anche sforzandomi io non saprei proprio chi votare, sono tutti oggettivamente terribili per motivi diversi. All’Italia serve principalmente una cosa: STABILITA’ E CONTINUITA’. E col sistema politico esistente, con partiti che semplicemente vendono giornalmente l’anima per mantenere i propri voti, maggioranze risicatissime che fanno traballare il governo un giorno sì e l’altro pure, semplicemente non è possibile.

{"title": "$META yolo update. $65k (unrealized) loss porn so far.", "selftext": "Hi everyone. Figured I would post this update, mostly to show the variance in my investment approach. It's very large, and my investment style is not suitable for most. I frequently get very bloody... However it's within my personal risk tolerances & has to be expected when you catch falling knives with leverage.\n\nI woke up to a bloody morning on meta & logged into my account. I've attached a screenshot of the loss porn for everyone to enjoy. This will be the last FB update until I close this position (I'm still holding).\n\nI plan to continue holding for a bit. I paid for the time. I may stop out if it looks like it's going to continue going down. I still suspect a bounce sometime in the next few weeks, and it could very well hit high 200's within the next few months. Maybe I'm wrong and get zucked. \n\nSee you when I close. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/rNPnApH\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[EDIT] \n\n&nbsp;\n\nLots of comments / questions about my particular strategies / risk tolerances. It's really quite simple:\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI just buy ATM / slightly OTM leaps (ideally 1+ year, but I bought ~50 weeks for FB) on companies that have recently taken a nose dive, that imo the market has overreacted to. The leaps typically offer me ~5-7x leverage. Then, when / if it bounces (I buy leaps to give it a ton of time to do this), I sell and walk with my 50-100% profits. Usually things bounce within a few months. I buy further expiries if I think it will take longer. I only touch companies / industries that I am semi familiar with. I buy with the intention / view that the market has overreacted, and the companies shares will recover. IE: I just buy the fucking dip. In my views, interest rate hikes are already priced in. That caused the dip we saw in the broader market. Markets are forward looking. Go be a 🌈🐻 somewhere else. \n\nShort term it always ends up bloody. Nobody starts green when buying the dips. I use the implicit leverage offered via leaps to maximize upside potential - and I can't get liquidated / margin called. I use options to isolate the risk and define maximum losses in case I am wrong. As long as I am correct more than not, it pays off to use this strategy. I often throw ~10%+ of my portfolio into these bets, and as long as I win on average I can obtain some nice tendies.\n\nPlus, it fills my gambling addiction. I get to see a 1-5% movement represent 7-25% movements in my portfolio. It's kind of like an FD that doesn't expire for years (movements are not quite as large) - but I'm more than happy seeing +/- 10-15% daily movements. This DOES lead to large drawdowns, such as seen here.

The market isn't reacting normally anymore, and I've never gone through this kind of economic decline... A wise man knows what he knows and knows what he doesn't: and this market is completely unexplored territory for me. I cashed out and bought myself a few nice toys. I will, of course, look to re-enter the market and snag some good deals when the world is starting to look a bit better...  \n\n\nBut nevertheless you want my thoughts on Nvidia! So here we go.\n\nI think all tech stocks are taking a massive beating. There are many reasons for this:\n\n1) Tech underwent a correction\n\n2) The Russia/Ukraine situation affected supply of certain gases required to make chips. This might have affected the industry, despite AMD saying it wouldn't.\n\n3) The cost of a wafer has gone up by quite a bit. So, all high-end chiplets and chips are going to be way more expensive for tech companies to buy and make - Nvidia is not immune to this, look at their 40 series pricing...\n\n4) There is uncertainty with Taiwan/China. If anything happens to Taiwan then a huge percentage of the worlds supply of high-end chips are going to come to an abrupt stop. The company in question here is TSMC, who fabricate a lot of the chips large companies need to make their high-tech products.\n\n5) There is without a doubt a depression coming...\n\n6) The cost of oil is going to skyrocket, which affects import/export prices around the globe.\n\n7) Energy prices are also going up, which will affect things similarly to point 6.\n\n8) Everyone is scared of this bear market and are cashing out - like myself.\n\n9) Dollar exchange rate - this affects import/exports prices rather negatively.\n\nSo, with all this in mind, you have to understand that I think Nvidia is quite high-risk. There is too much going on right now that could affect these stocks. I know the price of Nvidia looks good just now, but I think it will get worse before it gets better. That's my personal opinion and why I cashed out. \n\nLet's look at the positives though:\n\n1) Nvidia is pioneering AI within gaming. Their AI technology is starting to really bare fruit and, as a PC enthusiast, I am extremely impressed with what they can do now. In conjunction with what we're seeing AI do elsewhere around the world, I think Nvidia is actually ahead of the game here - if AMD and Intel can't leverage AI to the same degree as Nvidia, then Nvidia's products are always going to be more premium. As an example, I simply won't buy AMD GPU because I want the AI technology that Nvidia offers. This was less of a factor during the crypto boom where hashrate was king.\n\n2) Intel entering the market, in my opinion, isn't going to affect Nvidia that much. Their GPU's are simply too under-developed to compete. By the time they catch up, Nvidia could easily have added the Intel-specific features to their line of products. So despite my earlier comment, Intel won't be relevant for some time. \n\n3) Nvidia are ruthlessly pricing out partners in the market. You might have heard how EVGA have decided to exit the GPU market because of Nvidia. Well, this is because Nvdidia are offering cards with excellent PCB/Cooling at a much cheaper price than what partners can offer. Essentially, it's starting to look like Nvidia are about to leverage their advantage to basically become the main dominant seller of GPU's, stealing the market share from Asus, Gigabyte, Pascal, MSI, Zotac, EVGA and whoever else I'm forgetting. $$$$$\n\nClosing comments:\n\n1) Point 3 above could backfire - we don't actually know how the industry is going to react to Nvidia's kinda disgustingly ruthless domination of the market. \n\n2) Until we know what AMD are offering to compete with 40 series, we can't predict how next gen is going to look. For all we know AMD has an ace up their sleave - they absolutely kicked Intel's ass in a few years, they might be catching up on AI technology\n\n3) Try to see Nvidia as an AI and software company. And then compare them to others trying to do similar things. The GPU component of their product line is going to become less important now that GPU mining is coming to a halt and team red and blue start to compete more aggressively for the GPU market. Nvidia's AI and software are going to become their prize goose. (And to be honest it's been this way for some time already)\n\nI personally, would just use all this as a basis for research. I honestly couldn't, in good faith, recommend anything when I've never experienced this kind of craziness in the market. But I do keep an eye on tech and these are some very good points to look into and hopefully you'll be able to decide whether now is good or not.

Nvidia has the better RT chips by a long mile and it also has much better AI. Nvidia's DLSS and Ray tracing pushes their cards to the next level. Like I said, AMD are definitely catching up but Nvidia does have an edge in the GPU market. For example, as an enthusiast, I would take an RTX 3080/3090 over an AMD card in a heart beat. Nvidia is also better with driver updates, AMD has improved 10 fold on that but again, Nvidia has the edge. \n\nListen, I'm not trying to say one is better than the other.
