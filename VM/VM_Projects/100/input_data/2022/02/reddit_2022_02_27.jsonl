Russia has also threatened Nuclear War, in raising the readiness to use its nuclear stockpile.  Further, Russia has surrounded and physically encircled Kyiv.  This, eventually will starve out millions of innocent civilians in Ukraine.\n\nFurther, in the middle of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Russia spoke with Iran, a country which routinely shouts \"Death to America.\"  Also, China's #1 grossing film of 2021 was \"The Battle at Lake Changjin.\"  Hundreds of times in this film oh, that I personally watched, Americans were being depicted as Nazi-like people. This was a state-driven, pre-conflict propaganda movie.  Everyone should see how 'the West' is being falsely depicted.  And today, we can see that Russia's main propaganda arm, while he invades Ukraine, is to 'denazify' Ukraine, which makes no sense because Ukraine's president is Jewish.\n\nReports now show China leaked U.S.-provided intel back to Russia.  Yesterday, North Korea tested an intercontinental ballistic missile.  Today, China spoke with North Korea, citing [a \"new situation,\"](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-xi-message-nkoreas-kim-vows-cooperation-under-new-situation-kcna-2022-02-25/) on the same day that Russia has threatened nuclear war.

If you need more, this bag is FULL.  Goes on everything.  Star wars, Marvel, really anything with a plot hole or story hiccup.  No character flaw too huge, no incompetent writer's room too stupid, for Handwavium(tm)!  \n\nI mean, really.  They could have had Phase 4 being \"Tony Dead, Cap old.  New heroes comming out of the woodwork as the world struggles to deal with all of the everything.  For the reals?  Farming would become huge.  Like, half the world is farmers, because everyone would be SO STUPID at it.  We would elect fifth generation farmers for everything, because they would then tell us how to not screw it up, because everyone who does kills people.  All that food would be carted around and we would be struggling to survive.  The heroes would be needed to stop crime that would try and stomp down on the new farming initiatives, because that's where the wealth would be, not money, per se, but value.  Crooks would try and take it, heroes would defend it, and over the course of years people would get back up.  There would be new governments trying to organize, old enemies would have to become allies or die (there should definatly be a few of those \"Too stupid to live\" types, that would be fun), and when survival is put on the line, we do.\n\nThen Boom.  Without warning, everyone is back.  That whole process shifts AGAIN.  Groups that have been fighting forever are shocked to see they are teamed up with their enemies and have to have THAT fight all over again.  Some people come back and see their group is just gone.  Too stupid.  Sorry.  Oh, hey, are you too stupid too...or are you going to learn a lesson?  Yes?  No?  Another fun story.  Mix in the 'old' politicians and illuminati types trying to get power back from the new in chargers, but like, they have no power?  They are people who were declaired dead, so, no money, their contacts were cut off at the knees, and they don't have the same pull they had just five years and a day ago.  They say 'jump' and people are like 'who the fuck are you?  You farm?  Then get the fuck outta here!'  \n\nAlso, the old heroes come back to the same thing.  The new heroes and villains are dealing with each other, and they are forced to question their place in everything.  Too stupid to live Part 2, the Stupidining.  Maybe?  It was a real missed opportunity.  Like, D+ wanted to put out a dozen shows, but didn't want to have fans saying \"Where's Iron Man during this?\"  Well, he dead.  Everyone struggling.  This guy/gal is the only one who could POSSIBLY help, and thank goodness they do.  Here's a few episodes of them (a relative nobody) helping against a villain or two (also nobodys), and then the last episode could be the Snap.  Everyone is back and things get topsy turvey.  What do these heroes do?  Retire?  Continue to fight?  What if they are legally sued for using a base that wasn't really theirs to use, and now the 'owner' is back and can make a solid case?  What if they can't but they have the resources to even take it to court a little bit, which would bankrupt the hero?  Will they fight it, can they?  Tune in next season when we do some viewer surveys and see which heroes are popular enough to get another season!  We are telling stories, but we don't fund loosers!  \\*Handwavium\\*  DISNEY OUT!\n\nOr something.
