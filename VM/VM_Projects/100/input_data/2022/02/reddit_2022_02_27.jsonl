Ukraine’s Defense Ministry said representatives for Ukraine and Russia have agreed to meet on the Ukraine-Belarus border “with no preconditions.”\n\nLast week, President Joe Biden reacted to the attack by announcing several rounds of sanctions on Russian banks, on the country’s sovereign debt and Putin and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. \n\nThe U.S., European allies and Canada agreed Saturday to remove key Russian banks from the interbank messaging system, SWIFT.\n\nThe Russian ruble was set to tumble at least 19% with banks offering it at about 100 rubles per dollar, according to Reuters.

Russia has also threatened Nuclear War, in raising the readiness to use its nuclear stockpile.  Further, Russia has surrounded and physically encircled Kyiv.  This, eventually will starve out millions of innocent civilians in Ukraine.\n\nFurther, in the middle of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Russia spoke with Iran, a country which routinely shouts \"Death to America.\"  Also, China's #1 grossing film of 2021 was \"The Battle at Lake Changjin.\"  Hundreds of times in this film oh, that I personally watched, Americans were being depicted as Nazi-like people. This was a state-driven, pre-conflict propaganda movie.  Everyone should see how 'the West' is being falsely depicted.  And today, we can see that Russia's main propaganda arm, while he invades Ukraine, is to 'denazify' Ukraine, which makes no sense because Ukraine's president is Jewish.\n\nReports now show China leaked U.S.-provided intel back to Russia.  Yesterday, North Korea tested an intercontinental ballistic missile.  Today, China spoke with North Korea, citing [a \"new situation,\"](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-xi-message-nkoreas-kim-vows-cooperation-under-new-situation-kcna-2022-02-25/) on the same day that Russia has threatened nuclear war. And finally, it should be noted that China spoke out in its \"support' of Russia during this situation.\n\nTLDR: We are already living in World War III and we are all failing to admit that.  Wake up and BET accordingly. \"The Great Reset\" in global markets will now occur. I'll be looking at the kings and queens of 'meme' stocks to see some particular fireworks there, as I see them now as the best companies with the highest level of support.  And, the value-at-risk (VaR) and volatility (Vol) coefficients (NSCC's capital requirements algorithm) will 100% trigger margin calls on hedge funds' egregious and illicit short-borrow position on meme stocks, which from the latest Bloomberg report shows that there are 8.6 counterfeit shares for every one real share.", "id": "t2y2yt", "created_utc": 1645996640.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.47, "num_comments": 181, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|53|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|26|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=t2y2yt)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=t2y2yt)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Time to have a pint and wait for all this blow over", "score": 151, "replies": [{"body": "To the Winchester", "score": 72, "replies": [{"body": "Dogs can't look up.
