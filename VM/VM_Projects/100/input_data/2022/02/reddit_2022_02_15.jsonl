He also met Bill Gates through mutual acquaintances, and they have been close ever since.

He touts Phil Fisher’s investment style of talking to EVERYONE AND ANYONE to find out every bit of information of a company. On top of that he has been relied on by national and global leaders for advice. Of course he would find out information along those conversations.

Syria was all over the media and everyone was waiting for Iran to get involved and send the price of oil skyrocketing. Russia got involved, stabilized Syria, awiped out all moderate “terrorists” along with the extremists; and while this was happening with the right hand no one was really paying attention to what the left hand was doing. \n\nThe fully armed militia standing around the streets of Crimea in plain green uniforms just happened to put Spetsnaz insignias on the day after they voted to join Russia after the declared their independence. They area had strong ties to Russia and didn’t play a major role in gas pipelines.\n\nThe main concern here is Europe pushing nato right up to Russia’s border. Russia can only flex its muscle in the winter when Germany is depending on Russian gas to stop their citizens from freezing and eastern Ukrainian marshes are frozen enough to move tanks over. But again, this comes down to gas pipelines \n\nThis is their 3 month window to flex to get their political objectives \n\n1. They won’t want Ukraine joining nato. 2. They don’t want military forces past Kiev. 3. They want access to Odessa which is like 90% Russian and on the western side of the country 4. They want pipelines guarantees and better carrier rates for their gas that goes through the Ukraine until their secondary pipelines come online \n\nWhat’s the bigger play in all of this? Latvia and Estonia. They joined nato and sit right next to Belarus with a puppet government. Russia wants friendly leaders in all of those areas and the last thing they want is nato troops and bases setting up on their border. Imagine China or Russia started building bases in Canada or Mexico. Now imagine the United States was pumping gas through pipelines in these areas.\n\nIf Russia can’t get their pipelines into Western Europe built or correctly regulated they starve. They are still an oil and gas country. Saudi Arabia has been over producing oil for the last decade to fight US shale oil projects and its held the price of oil under $100 a barrel. With the spike in global inflation, oil should be well past $150 a barrel. All of this saber rattling has driven the price of oil up to $80-$90.\n\nThe moment tanks roll into Kiev the oil market will double. That is the point the house of cards comes crashing down. If Russia does start a war and nato tries to get involved they shut the gas pipelines down in the middle of winter and Europeans freeze. They send the oil market spiraling into chaos and make it impossible to ship food to markets.

The one you have probably encountered many times in the wilderness of reddit or twitter. It goes like this:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Tesla's car sales will grow 50% annually for foreseeable future. Eventually reaching annual production rate of 20M by 2030. Source: [Technoking himself](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1310486616075579393)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Net margins will stay as high or even grow further from the latest 13.1% (Q4 2021). Commonly cited reasons are 4680, Gigacasting... maybe even Alien Dreadnought?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Tesla is a tech company. They will generate tons of revenue by selling software such as ~~Fraud~~ Full-Self-Driving, and might eventually launch their own marketplace (see AppStore).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Tesla is... *ETF**?* (cannot add a link to youtube video, but it is from solving the money problem)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Tesla ~~sex~~bot. Enough said.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet's start with an automotive sales part:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Say Tesla is such Gigachad^(TM) that it reaches 20M sales without reducing the prices or introducing the cheaper model(s). According to Q4 2021 Financial Report, current **ASP is $50.7K**, derived as auto revenue excl. regulatory credits divided by the number of delivered cars. Assuming 3% average inflation for the next 9 years (incl. current spike) the ASP in 2030 would be **$66.2K** (50.7 x 1.03\\^9)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* With **net margins of 13%** that would result in **66.2K x 20M x 0.13 = $172B net income**.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Eventually growth by 2030 will taper and converge to automotive industry average. As of writing, PEs of auto peers: Toyota - 9.64, Volkswagen - 6.88, Ford - 10.10, GM - 7.10, BMW - 4.75. But Tesla being Tesla, so we award an automotive **Tesla PE of 15**.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Tesla market cap by end 2030 is (drum roll...) **172B x 15 = 2.58T**. An absolute automotive leader with 20M sales at an average price of 66.2K USD, with outstanding operating margins (\\~twice the industry average), with PE 15 (approximately twice the industry average) will triple from the current valuation (or double from January 3's)?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Taking an average of 7% market growth leads to Net Present Value (NPV) of 2.58T / 1.07\\^9 = **1.4T\\*,** so *...* Tesla on January 3rd was pretty fairly valued? Although why would anyone invest in a single stock for a 7% growth versus investing into SPY?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* From the other angle, if you invest in TSLA now (market cap of 890B as of writing) it will return you (2.58 / 0.89)\\^(1/9) = 1.125 or **12.5% annually**. Not too shabby, but also anything but impressive in contrast to its growth in the last two years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut careful observer would remind me that we are talking about *Tech* company and not an *Auto* company. But before we go there... let's discuss what is wrong with the bull thesis above.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Chapter 2. Automotive market.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMany analyses that I have read address future volumes only from the perspective of the supply. Analyses argue that the ramp up of the existing factories plus the introduction of new ones can support 50% growth, eventually reaching 20M car sales by 2030. What they often fail to address is the total addressable market (TAM), which is in our case the EV market in 2030. To be clear, below we will include both plug-in hybrids (PHEV) and battery electric vehicles (BEV) as parts of the EV market. The main reasoning is that for a wide target audience PHEV covers 95% of all use-cases (daily trips within a city) with electric power, therefore creates a real alternative to buying BEV (what happened to me and my wife personally). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNo doubt the EV market will be enormous by 2030. In particular:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* EU proposes to ban new ICE cars by 2035 ([source](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/eu-proposes-effective-ban-new-fossil-fuel-car-sales-2035-2021-07-14/)). Citation: \"... if the EU raised its CO2 emission reduction targets to 50% by 2030, it would bring new fossil-fuel car sales across the bloc down to virtually zero by then... Brussels also proposed allowing plug-in hybrids to count as low-emission vehicles up to 2030 ...\". From this we can assume **EV penetration rate of a 100% in EU by 2030.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* China plans to transition 40% vehicles sales to so-called \"New Energy vehicles\" (that include plug-in hybrids, fuel cells, and battery electric vehicles) by 2030 ([source](https://www.autonews.com/china/china-explores-ambitious-goal-ev-sales-2035)). So **EV penetration rate in China of 40% by 2030.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* and USA target half of all vehicles sold in 2030 in US to be electric (also includes plug-in hybrids, [source](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/05/climate/biden-tailpipe-emissions-electric-vehicles.html)), i.e. **50% EV penetration rate for the US by end 2030**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* The rest of the World mostly do not have any plans for phasing-out Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) cars ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase-out_of_fossil_fuel_vehicles)). Anecdotally, when I visited my hometown of 300K population (in former USSR country) last winter I couldn't locate a single EV, whereas they are common in European city where I live now. We will make an assumption of **20% EV penetration rate for the rest of the world.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2019 automotive sales by region as a percentage of the global are as follows ([source](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/passenger-car-sales-by-key-region-2010-2020e)): China - 26.5%, EU - 25.3%, US - 18.0%, Rest of the World - 30.2%. By taking into account assumptions on regional EV penetrations rate, we obtain: 0.265 x 0.4 + 0.253 x 1.0 + 0.180 x 0.5 + 0.302 x 0.2 = **0.509 or 50.9% global EV penetration rate.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe next step is to evaluate total car sales in 2030. There are various forecasts, however most of them are in the same ballpark. According to ResearchAndMarkets ([source](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211014005505/en/Global-Automotive-Market-COVID-19-Growth-Forecast-2020-2030---ResearchAndMarkets.com)) global automotive sales should reach **122.8M units by 2030.** Worth noting that global automotive sales did not practically rise since 2016. Yet most of the research firms keep 2030 target by adjusting CAGR, which I personally find as an unlikely scenario. Especially with the recent inflation, chip shortage, supply chain and other issues.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNevertheless, by multiplying forecasted global automotive sales to global EV penetration rate we obtain **62.5M EV cars (PHEV + BEV) to be sold in 2030.** It is important to understand that this is a **bullish estimate rather than the base.** First of all, we applied a very rude global level calculation. To be more accurate we need to apply analysis on the regional levels. In particular, auto sales for the rest of the World and China are expected to grow much faster than in the EU region. Therefore, lower EV penetration rate of the former (20% and 40%) relative to the latter (100%) would result in the lower global EV sales by 2030 than we estimated. Second, it is clear by commentary of the experts and the press that the aforementioned phase-out plans are ambitious and can be taken as a stretch targets. Elon in 2020 himself believed that the global BEV market would only be 30M by 2030 ([source](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1310486616075579393)).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Chapter 3. Tesla's market share.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFrom [EV-Volumes.com](https://EV-Volumes.com), we can take the annual global EV sales for the past years. It's easy to estimate Tesla's market share from this graph:\n\n* 2018: 245K / 2082K = **11.8%**\n* 2019: 367K / 2276K = **16.2%**\n* 2020: 500K / 3240K = **15.4%**\n* 2021: 936K / 6750K = **13.9%**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot to raise an alarm, but it looks like Tesla's market share peaked at 16.2% and already started to decay. Two years is a bit short of a timeframe to make conclusions on the trend. But it is difficult to restrain yourself from making a connection between the loss of Tesla's market share and ramp up of Chinese OEMs, VW (id family), and wide range of PHEV from legacy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor 2030, in my most bullish view Tesla can at most maintain its 13.9% market share. Take into account the combination of increasing aforementioned competition and almost nonexistent roadmap of Tesla. To elaborate, Tesla has in production four models (two original designs from aesthetics perspective - head and tail lamps, bumpers, interior, etc.) - Model S/X and Model 3/Y. Cybertruck is expected to launch soon, however according to Elon himself, the target for CT is a mere 250K annual production.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nModel S/X is already a 10-years old design (except for the front facelift and an interior update). Model 3/Y's original design is 5-years old with no major updates yet. Given the 4-5 year median time between announcements and production of Tesla, we should not expect any new mass production model(s) before 2026. Especially given an already long pipeline of unfinished projects (Cybertruck, Roadster - niche product, Semi, etc.). By that time Model 3/Y would be 9 year old design (comparable to the current state of Model S/X).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe have observed firsthand what such aging without any major updates might mean for the sales. Since 2018 combined sales of Model S/X dropped from 101.5K to 24.4K in 2021 (it was going down consistently for all the previous years as well, so do not attribute overall drop just to a model refresh). It is not difficult to understand why. When someone buys a new car for $100K, that person wants to make sure that people around recognize it as a new car for $100K and not say 10-year old used one for the price of $30K.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo in order for Tesla to keep up the market share it needs to step up its game in introducing new models and doing major updates for existing ones. If people will start considering Model 3/Y to be rather outdated, the demand will fall off the cliff as we have seen with Model S/X. The fall of Model S/X can be attributed to the release of Model 3/Y. But unlike in 2017, there are far more alternatives now to the aging Model 3/Y as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDespite all that, let's consider Tesla will sustain its 13.9% market share through 2030. Recall our estimates on EV global sales of 62.5M in 2030 and we obtain **8.7M Tesla cars to be sold in 2030.** This is whopping **56.5% lower** than in the original bull thesis, and will respectively lead to a **TSLA valuation of 1.12T USD in 2030.** An **annual return of 2.5% (below inflation)** if you invest at current prices.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Chapter 4. ASP**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPerhaps for Teslanaires throwing $50K at a car is no big deal, but for most people said $50K is actually big money. If Tesla wants to sell 8.7M cars it needs to either (or preferably both) reduce the ASP of existing model lines or introduce cheaper ones. Especially given the aforementioned points on increasing competition, poor roadmap and aging line-up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n8.7M correspond to 7.1% of the total projected car sales in 2030. Only two brands (note, not manufacturers) had comparable market shares in 2020, namely Toyota with 8.5% and Volkswagen with 7.8% respectively ([source](https://www.statista.com/statistics/316786/global-market-share-of-the-leading-automakers/)). It is only logical to assume that the price distribution of Tesla cars should follow that of a Toyota or Volkswagen rather than, for example, Mercedez-Benz (3.1%) or BMW (2.7%). Neither Toyota Motor Corporation nor Volkswagen Group do not break down the sales and revenues by brands. We will take Toyota as an example as it only contains 2 major brands (Toyota and Lexus) in contrast to 5 major brands of Volkswagen (Volkswagen, Audi, Skoda, Seat and Porsche).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAccording to the latest [Toyota Financial report](https://global.toyota/pages/global_toyota/ir/financial-results/2022_3q_presentation_en.pdf) (Q1-Q3 combined) **ASP of Toyota car is 3.8M yen or 33K USD**, estimated by dividing automotive revenue of 23.3T yen by car deliveries of 6.1M. In reality these 23.3T yen also included financial services, and 6.1M deliveries also include Lexus, but it's a good enough approximation. Under the assumption that Tesla can dictate $5K premium for the same market share, **Tesla's 2030 ASP is $49.5K** (38K x 1.03\\^9) or **25% lower** than the original bull thesis assumption of $66K.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDeducting these extra 25% results in **TSLA valuation by end 2030 of $840B**, or **-0.7%** **annual return if you invest today**. See the discrepancy between these numbers and 3-10T valuations TSLAnalysts target for as soon as 2025? And they often claim that nothing other than auto sales are included in their models.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Margins.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne topic I will not touch in this post is net margins, as it deserves its own DD. For now we assumed the same margins in all of the cases. In fact, lower ASP (e.g. cheaper models), increasing number of service centers (to keep up with production), etc. would definitely put a pressure on margins. On the other hand Tesla investments in Gigacasting and structural batteries might (or might not) help to increase margins. Drawbacks of the latter two is lower (to none) repairability that would lead to higher warranties costs. As I said, the topic deserves its own DD.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Chapter 5. Share dilution or Twitter polls**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen we discuss the share price we should also touch such concept as *share dilution.* Even if Elon personally says enough and stops diluting shareholders via his out-of-this-universe bonus plans. Note that for the last 5 years alone number of outstanding shares increased from 0.8B to 1.12B ([source](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TSLA/tesla/shares-outstanding)), and to my understanding that might not yet include non-executed options of Elon (experts please weigh in).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDue to the expected high-growth, i.e. ramp ups of existing ~~factories~~ Gigafactories and introduction of new models, Tesla is unlikely to offer stock buybacks until 2030. And even if we assume that Tesla will not raise any more funds either, share dilution will still take place via employee stock compensations alone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA good comparison would be Amazon, unlike Microsoft or Apple who offer a lot of buybacks. For the last 7 years Amazon experienced an average share dilution of 1.1% ([source](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AMZN/amazon/shares-outstanding)). Needless to say this is a bullish target for a company in a more infancy stage such as Tesla. Applying average of 1.1% over the course of 9 years (end of 2030) brings **total share dilution to 10.3%** (1.011\\^9).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn top of that, Elon demonstrated that not only he loves to bonus compensations, he is open to sell them, i.e. increase the *float.* Which is in short to mid term is even more important for a stock price than outstanding shares as it increases the supply on the open market. But in shouldn't play a role in theory for the long term (again, in theory).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The results:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf I would want to invest in Tesla now, such that it returns me in average annually 10% (vs 7% average of SPY) and we apply:\n\n* our estimated target for market cap of **840B USD**, \n* and take into account bullish 10.3% share dilution, \n\nTesla should not be valued more than: 840 / 1.1\\^9 / (1.103) **= 323B USD today**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOr with the current number of outstanding shares: 323B / 1.123B = **287 USD per share today**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor Tesla bulls: before you say it's outrageous, note how this model still results in $TSLA current market cap equivalent of Toyota and way bigger than VW group. And all that due to the high expectations of growth alone. However, **expectations of high growth over the long timeframe involves a lot of risks, that we didn't even account for.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Chapter other product lines of Tesla:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs for the other product lines, it's difficult to judge them now as they are in their infancy. Solar installation seems to be dropping since the days of SolarCity ([source](https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2018/05/03/tesla-energy-storage-deployments-way-up-solar-slows-further/)). Since 2018 solar installations seems to be recovering and the energy storage seems to be increasing (source: latest quarterly report). However, it is clear from the financial statements that both of these businesses lose money already on the gross margin level. In particular, Tesla reported Automotive Gross margins of 29.3% and *Total* Gross margins of 25.3%.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow a company exactly calculates gross expenses might differ, but losing money on the gross margin is rarely a good sign. It often means that the costs of goods sold already exceeds the selling price. Think of it as Tesla spending $100 to buy solar tiles, another $50 for shipping, and $200 for labor to install it, whereas only sells it for $250 to a customer. On top of that there are operational expenses that include general management and accounting, engineers, marketing, their bonuses, office expenses, etc. that affect Operating margins.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe TAM of storage and solar by 2030 is debatable. It is clear however, that the biggest solar companies in the world ([source](https://www.investopedia.com/10-biggest-solar-companies-5077655)) have valuations of just few billions. So adding 100s of billions to Tesla's valuation based on Solar business is unreasonable. I bet the same holds for energy installation business.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Chapter Hype: Fraud Self Driving**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis one is the closest to my heart. Disclaimer, I work for the top automotive semiconductor company and contribute to automotive sensors for high-level autonomy. And by proxy, I also have some understanding of the post-processing side of things, what Silicon Valley folks refer to as Machine Learning, Sensor Fusion, Behavioral Planning, etc. So I could probably write the whole DD just related to this topic, but instead I will try to keep this chapter simple. No discussions on the strategy, sensor suits, architectures. We will only talk about simple concept - *disengagements.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSince Tesla doesn't share any statistics on disengagements of FSD, we can only rely on the videos coming from the OG Tesla ~~shills~~ beta-testers. If you explore the prairies of Youtube you will encounter hundreds, if not thousands, of FSD videos. At first, you would be even impressed. But we fellow investors should not mix emotions with raw numbers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter your careful research you would realize that (anecdotally) average disengagement rate is about 1 disengagement per 1-5 miles. Elon's statements on Tesla being on the path of marching nines is heavily misleading. If you think emotionally, a car driving all by itself for 1 to 5 mile is an impressive feat. And maybe it is, which is not an achievement of Tesla per se, but the whole industry since the days of Darpa's challenges and even before.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut if we think practically, we realize that 1-5 miles is too short of a distance. In average US driver drove 14000miles in 2019 ([source](https://www.kbb.com/car-advice/average-miles-driven-per-year/)). For the sake of the argument, let's say that not all FSD disengagements would have led to lethal accidents if not taken. Be it 10%... f\\*\\*k it, say 1%. That is still 1 lethal accident per 100-500 miles. Or 28 - 140 lethal accidents per year. Would you trust a system to drive you or your loved one home, if you know that the system will try to (or successfully) kill you every second week or even day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf Tesla reduces disengagement rate from there by 100, You still end up with 0.28 - 1.4 dangerous disengagement per year. That's where the big problem starts to appear. Since a car is NOT trying to kill you for 364 days in a year, you start to become complacent and that's where the first accidents will happen. After few lethal accidents people perhaps will become very cautious again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFast forward, Tesla reduces disengagement rate by another factor of 100. Now it's one lethal accident in 100-300 years! Tesla so far produced 2.5M cars with FSD take rate of 10%, i.e. 250K wild FSDs out there. And that results *still* in 830 to 2500 lethal accidents per year due to FSD.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd that is how marching nines looks like. When Tesla will fight against statistics as people will get more and more complacent. But we are long way from this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Chapter Hype: To be continued...**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI could also rant about 4680, Gigacasting, vertical integration. Especially on the last topic I have something to say from semiconductor perspectives (given Tesla's ambitions with FSD chip and DoJo). But all of these topics I might include in some other DD later on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Chapter History.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA bit of a detour into a history of stock market. I like to compare Tesla to C*isco*. Just like Tesla, Cisco was **the** ***stonk*** **in 2000**. Cisco actually was the **World's biggest** company by market cap with a valuation of 500B, adjusted to inflation - 800B. But that number makes no justice to what Cisco was. In 2000 the World GDP was about 34B vs 84B now (source: [statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/268750/global-gross-domestic-product-gdp/)), SPY was around 150 vs 470 now. So, Cisco price was equivalent to 1.25 to 1.5T of today's dollars.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd yet, market analysts did claim that Cisco still had a lot of room to grow. For instance, [this bloomberg article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/1999-09-13/cisco-could-be-the-safest-net-play-around) claims Cisco was the safest Net play back then. And another [nice fella from Credit Suisse believed](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/stories/2000/03/20/story2.html) Cisco will be valued at 1T in just a few years! 1T of 2000 dollars no less. Does such claims sound familiar? At the time of the article, 37 investment banks rated it buy or strong buy, and NONE sell or even hold! By the way, article was released on 19 March 2000. See how they almost perfectly timed the top?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBy looking at CSCO all-time chart you can see how the story ended. In 20 years the price haven't recovered to it's ATH. Add to that how much market has grown, inflation, and you will realize that the real returns are much worse than -28%. Nowadays Cisco is the real solid company with a current valuation of 230B and PE ratio of 20. The problem is it was just too overvalued and too overhyped around 2000. Was Cisco a part of the future back in 2000? Absolutely. But sometimes you need to ask yourself how much that future is worth.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt doesn't really matter whether Tesla is 1-5-10 years ahead of competition. What matters is how much that lead actually worth?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy conclusion results that the bullish target for TSLA is 287USD. I am not a financial advisor so only you yourself are responsible for you financial decisions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S. Fun fact, $TSLA is valued at approx. $890B / 2.5M = $356K per every car Tesla ever sold (it was $480K per car as late as January 3). When Hertz \"announced\" 100K order from Tesla, $TSLA jumped around $400K per every car. This creates an interesting philosophical question: didn't we just discover perpetuum mobile? You can buy a Tesla car from a wealth generated by $TSLA which in fact would increase the value of former even more. Could it be that all Tesla buyers are former or current $TSLA holders? khm....\n\nEdit: since many people are so kind to ask me to short Tesla, I just wanted to make clear I already shorted: [positions](https://imgur.com/a/EOz1rlC).

Your problem is that you assumed that Tesla would grow revenue 26% per year and profit 29% per year (much lower than what they are guiding for, but ok) through 2030 and still get a P/E of 15? That’s ridiculously low for that level of growth. AMZN P/E is around 74 ($3,100 divided by $41.91 EPS excluding one time Rivian stock gain) for lower levels of growth. And before you pull the “but it’s an automotive company” bullshit, think for a second. Tesla already has the highest net income margin in the automotive business and still expanding, has virtually no debt, and has been able to grow faster than any other automotive company. Nothing about Tesla’s business fundamentals says it’s a traditional auto, and it should not be valued as such. You will never see Tesla at 15 P/E this decade.\n\nYour other problem is assuming flat net income margin through 2030. Tesla has shown incredible and consistent operating leverage (meaning operating expenses grow more slowly than revenue/gross profit) hence their constant margin expansion over the last couple years. This is probably your most bearish assumption. \n\nOverall, your assumptions are just very, very bearish relative to the current reality right now.\n\nBy the way, your $287 price target represents a trailing 12 month P/E of only 59, and a forward P/E of <24.

Its difficult to judge then that their SW is good just because \"look their hardware is shit, but they still manage to do something\". Well so do Comma.Ai. they manage to do *something* even with a single camera. But disengagement rate, oh my. How could you say which SW is better: the one with disengagement of 1 per 5 miles but just cameras, or one with disengagement rate of 1 per 20000 miles (Waymo) but all sorts of sensors? Its just not quantifiable, whereas you somehow claim it is. Now, I am bringing Waymo and not car OEM because clearly OEMs are not as invested in the topic as Tesla / Waymo / Cruise bunch.

As a taxi service or other similar thing, there is a shot, but I view their solution as taking a machine gun to a cockroach.\n\nMy thesis for why tesla has the winning formula is very hand waiving, but I think an honest look at the industry with a pinch of optimism and its not far off. Essentially, assuming we agree there is no magic soul that gives humans the ability to reason (drive) \"good enough\", it is reasonable to believe a sufficiently trained AI can outperform given the same inputs and levers of control. By tesla choosing to forgo the obvious and expensive answer to the question of how should the car see, lidar, and instead working with what should be sufficient, regular cameras, they are approaching the problem of \"how can we use ai to solve our problem\" from a more wholistic approach, and will result in core competencies that compound more consistently over time.\n\nPerhaps a simplistic analogy, it's like learning methods to solve higher order polynomials from scratch rather than using your $100 graphing calculator. The $5 dollar calculator has all the tech necessary to calculate the answer, it just requires a more thoughtful interaction (understanding factoring/roots).\n\nSo, we look at the task of getting a computer to drive a car. For all of human history, we have deemed ourselves good enough. And we have objectively shitty hardware for the job (especially in that our interaction with the hardware is by definition subjective). We have some 100 degrees of meaningful FoV, with a lot of extra degrees in peripheral. We have reaction times to these inputs of the order of 100ms to 1s, depending on age/awareness/etc. And our precision/accuracy/repeatability in these input-outout interactions is on an even worse spectrum. The only people who can drive cars with near computer precision are F1 drivers and the like.\n\nFor tesla to get as far through the problem as they have, with cameras, they have mastered AI concepts that other competitors using lidar have 'skipped' over. While it may have cost them time, their early start cancels it out. And for having solved what they have, they are better for it. As the problem progresses and evolves they will retain skill sets and understandings that competitors paid their way to avoid. \n\nSo maybe the kid using the graphing calculator is way faster than the one on the dollar store one, but once the problem changes, even a little, the graphing calculator kid will be caught much more flat footed. And the self driving problem is changing every single day.\n\nSo you can see where the hand waiving is coming in, but for good measure, let's take a lay of the land. Musk, love him or hate him, is objectively special. Not only for being born into his lot of life, but for earnestly trying to understand these problems to their core. As a result, this one CEO is able to run multiple, successful, industry shaking companies (SpaceX imo is one of the most impressive companies in the world right now, in terms of ambition and execution). He is much closer to an engineer than a business man. His competition is led by people who are generally businessmen first in close contact with teams of engineers. While most of the time that difference shouldn't matter much, it's those edge cases where the guy at the top has to choose \"lidar, or cameras?\". Such a simple decision, one or the other, but the impacts are immense. To have someone at the helm who understands the ramifications of that decision, down to the linear algebra, will result in more sound decision making. When looking at the tesla range of cars, their design and packaging of all components echos their immense understanding of the task at hand. While other companies have departments quardening off volumes of space, \"chassis better not get near our air reservoirs! We need that space!\", tesla has engineers actually working together, \"hey, if we use an extrusion for this structural member we can actually use the internal volume as our resevoir!\". \n\nSo, when you take tesla as a whole, their execution, ambition, leadership, designs, etc... it just screams *big fucking brains*. Even seeing the progress they've made with the same self driving hardware package over the years is immensely impressive.\n\nI'll stop the wall of text here. Musk is exceptional at working with teams of engineers, especially compared to his peers. I would not want to bet against him at this point in time.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "  \nOkay, you took some freedom before to say that I have no understanding of ML / NN, etc. Some in this thread claimed that I am straight away stupid and work as a janitor (by the way, why would someone really insult the whole group of people like that, I have all the respect for janitors). So let me be a bit free now and say that the more I read your comments the more I am doubting your expertise in the area. Still, let me say that I understand where are you coming from, but you made very bold analogies which are completely unbased.   \n   \nYou made an interesting analogy with calculators (5$ vs 100$ graphic calculator) but for some interesting reason (given your experience no less!) you decided to compare or rather make an analogy of Self-driving problem with polynomial equation. Being an engineer as you are, you should know that not all problems can be solved in closed form. In fact many problems cannot. In this case neither student with 5$ calculator nor the one with 100$ calculator will be able to solve it. They would probably need to write a software and solve to some acceptable accuracy on a powerful machine. So when making such analogies how do you decide what sort of problem to select? Is Self-Driving more akin to polynomial equation or rather Navier-Stokes equation?  \nAnother frivolous analogy is of brain + thought process vs NN hardware (whatever that might be GPU, TPU, etc.) + NN. You really blew my mind when you explained to me that many tasks silicon chip performs much faster than human. I didn't know that, right? It's a well known fact since the days when (not even silicon based) computers replaced human computers. Yet, 50 years later most of work was not replaced by computers (although some did). Because as it turns out as we realize that computer can be much faster in solving some problems than humans some they cannot solve at all (coming up with mathematical theorems or writing poems, etc.). I know what gives you so much confidence. Recent advancements in AI makes it look like we are very close to human level of creativity, but it's a 80/20 fallacy where we see 80% result for 20% of work and think little left to reach the rest 20%. Don't take my words for it, listen to Yann LeCun or many other world experts on the topic.   \nBack to the topic, in your opinion \"Soul\" is the only thing that could possible hold NN not reaching human capability, e.g. in driving? And since neither of us believe in it means that NN will converge to human capabilities in driving or even more-so to AGI some time soon? The thing is we don't know full potential of NN and how close we are to the end of it (again, listen to Yann LeCuns analogy of mountain peaks. We might be reaching a first peak and only then realize there are peaks after peaks after peaks much higher than where we are now). Karpathy himself said you cannot compare artificial Neuron from NN to human brain Neuron. Human brain Neuron is much more complex. Many experts now come to conclusion that human neuron is more akin to a small neural net itself. And human brain contains 100B of such small neural nets, and 10\\^13-10\\^15 synapses in cortex alone (think of synapse as a weight between two neurons). While GPT-3 has 175B parameters. Yet, it's difficult to compare them apples to apples. But most importantly we do not understand how the processing in our brain really works. Not at all. Temporarily our brain works in a much complex way, for example, way more feedback loops within a net, than in your typical HydraNet of Tesla where they just apply some temporal filtering on the final layers or maybe even on the output.   \nIt's easy to simpify the fact that we drive only with our eyes which sometimes are not even that good from pure resolution perspective (again, no 1-to-1 comparison but my reply is getting long already). But the way Eye – Thalamus – Cortex interacts together in a much closer loop simply cannot be compared to a more straightforward camera – NN dataflow (where camera just spits out uniformly distributed images and send it to NN).   \nSo all in all, your long previous reply was of no essence at all. You made some frivolous analogies and absolutely unbased assumptions. You don’t know a) what sort of problem Self-Driving is (we are still finding this out), b) what sort of software and hardware architectures solving it would require. By making conclusion, Human drives with Eyes + brains therefore car can self-drive with camera + NN is such a non-engineer thing to say. Exactly who Elon is. Look at Tesla state now, in a clear weather somewhere in California they can drive without disengagements for 1-5 sometimes 10 miles (talking city miles, tired of people replying me with citingn100 miles highways with no disengagements). Add non clear weather, snow, rain, expand to other regions (India, China, etc.) with different rules, more chaotic traffic, etc. you will quickly see how far are they from declaring the problem solved. So I cannot, and that is what I emphasized many times in the reply, make any conclusions from what I see that they will EVER reach the solution given the direction they have chosen. Nor reach the conclusion they will NEVER reach. So anybody’s guess. But anyone claiming they are miles ahead simply don’t know what they are talking about.   \nBy the way, I skimmed your tribute to Elon but didn’t read it carefully since I don’t understand how that relates to our discussion.

A PE of 15 for a company with Tesla's margins is quite low.\n* You're using margins comparable to today for 2030, despite Tesla heavily investing in new factories without utilizing their economies of scale yet. I believe 13% is an extreme bear case for Tesla's margins in 2030, not a bull case.\n* You're forecasting the automotive market based on numbers during a pandemic and loads of supply chain issues. It's not reasonable to expect a 25% drop in annual sales just because the last two years have been troubled by lockdowns, logistical and supply chain issues. Especially with EVs becoming cheaper than comparable ICE vehicles, it's much more realistic to forecast a slight increase in sales compared to pre-COVID, to around 90-100M a year.\n* You're forecasting Tesla's market share based on a time period where they are building two new factories that will each build more cars than their two current factories combined. You say their market share probably peaked, but it very easily could be going up again once Berlin and Texas open up, as these factories will bring Tesla's installed capacity to somewhere in the 5M a year range as they ramp up.\n* You're comparing ASP's of ICE cars with EVs. That makes no sense, as EVs have much lower cost of ownership and people are willing to pay a bit more today to save a lot in the future. Especially when taking into account car leasing where you don't pay that extra amount up front but do enjoy the lower recurring costs. Factoring in inflation, I think $50K ASPs may be a little on the low end.\n\nTaking just these five points, if we forecast the automotive market to increase to 100M, with Tesla having a 18% market share with ASP's of $55K, margins of 20% and a PE of 20 (remember you said you were talking about the bull case, not a base case), we're already at 100M * 0.18 * 55,000 * * 0.2 * 20 = $3,960,000,000,000 or roughly $4T or about $4,000 per share.\n\nSo to say that $287 is a BULL target in 2030, even if you're just looking purely at the automotive business and ignoring everything else including their car software, is simply not realistic.", "score": 56, "replies": [{"body": "Nah i liked OPs analysis better.

I think 122M might be a bit on the high side, but 50% market penetration for EVs is an extremely low estimate.\n\nEVs are expected to reach price parity with ICE cars by next year. By 2030, they'll be $5-10K lower than ICE cars. Who in their right mind is going to pay $5-10K more to get a car that's more more expensive to drive, less safe, slower, requires more maintenance, has higher price depreciation, pollutes more, etc. etc.? Supply will undoubtedly continue to be the constraint for EV adoption this decade, but if you want to look at a bull case for EV adoption you need to be somewhere around the 80% range in EU/CH/JP/KR/NA.\n\nSo 80% of ~90M brings me to 72M EVs sold compared to your 50M.

As a gesture of recognition from the dark side, I want to point out two broad points that I think you're missing.\n\nOne, you're not recognizing the category difference between a Tesla vehicle and other vehicles. This leads you to putting Tesla vehicles into buckets where they don't belong. People that would normally buy nothing more than a used Prius are paying $30k-$40k more for a Tesla, without hesitation. Tesla's cars are in a different category the way the iPhone was in a different category from feature phones. But making this precise is like trying to pin down the difference between the food at two different restaurants. There's no real proper language for doing such a thing. If it's not obvious to you from just visiting Tesla's website, then you should regard it as a blind spot that you have. This blind spot is by far the biggest reason short sellers have lost so much money in the company's history.\n\nAnd to be clear, this doesn't have anything to do with the EV component. A car such as the Mach e, which is a great first generation EV by Ford, is not in the same category as a Tesla. Ford's next generation products will be better, and eventually Tesla's competitors will make something in roughly the same category as a Tesla, but it may take until 2025 or beyond. The timeline to watch is how long it takes the industry's software systems to shift away from the decentralized, outsourced, difficult-to-coordinate model to one which is more centralized and vertically integrated, something which is currently completely unnatural to the industry. As someone with an understanding of software, you probably understand the advantage Tesla has as a company which develops their entire software stack, vs an industry which regards components as impenetrable black boxes. Consider the implications of this for over-the-air updates, for example. Of course there are pros and cons to these different approaches, but the pros go to Tesla at this stage in the game.\n\nSecond, you're looking at Tesla in isolation and not taking into account large-scale issues that will affect the automotive industry as a whole. The current ICE industry sells cars at certain prices. These prices are based on a gigantic global machine called the auto industry. This machine requires certain volumes to function properly. If the ICE industry permanently loses say 20% or 30% of demand, this high-scale machine will have to down-shift to a lower scale, and it will do so catastrophically. The end result is higher prices. ICEs will become even more expensive than EVs, in a more rapid fashion than people expect. Automakers which have not leapt far enough into the EV world as the weight of their ICE assets drags them into the abyss will not survive. This is just one major problem facing competitors.\n\nAgain, kudos for laying things down in writing. I think you're way ahead of the game just by doing that. Despite the supposed financial literacy of short sellers, in reality many of them have just jumped from one piece of confirmation bias to the next, so it's good to see someone bringing clarity to their thought process.

Then use the anticipated news itself as a liquidity event. You may have heard of “buy the rumor, sell the news.” Plenty of examples from 2020 and 2021 of run ups in SPACs on LOI or “in talks” news only to get sold off when the DA and merger slidedeck are released.\n\nThe threat of raising rates really just creates the same sell off that raising rates would do, except since it’s heavily telegraphed, there’s a good chance the actual act of raising of rates itself will mark the bottom.\n\nWhy do I care then? Because anticipatory news gives not only a headstart to the players that figure it out early (the market would likely gap down from a surprise rate hike) but it also preserves liquidity for them to sell into.

High inflation (considered over 2% per year) can reduce future cash flow and the Feds reaction to it  by increasing interest rate makes it worse. \n\nFirst, Inflation increases the cost of projects and products independently. \n\nSay you are writing a software, building a pipeline, constructing a subdivision etc. Previously you used a 2% increase factor for calculation of 2nd year costs. Now that increases and it gets worse for longer term projects. So you either increase the price or keep the price and reduce your profit. \n\nThe law of supply and demand in economy says at higher prices, buyers will demand less of an economic good. As a result either your revenue or your profits will be reduced. \n\nTherefore on its own the future cash flows, the driving predictor of stock prices will be negatively impacted with inflation. \n\nSecond, Feds know that unchecked inflation can cause massive economic downturn and extended recessions. So they increase the interest rate to slow down rapid  inflation growth and that further increases the cost of production/operation a lot of which are financed. \n\nHistorically the stock market growth slows down or reverses with increased inflation.
