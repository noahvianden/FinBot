When investing, look into the history of the sector you’ll be putting your money into. As for the internal combustion auto, in the US at the onset of the era there were several hundred thriving producers of automobiles- by the 80s you had basically 4. The onset of the electric vehicle has seen a similar trajectory- especially in the era of the SPAC. The history tells us that a bunch of people are going to lose their shirts while a handful of folks lucky or diversified enough strike gold.\n\nIf you’re looking for a more sensible long-term approach you’ve got to look at the bigger picture around the sector. It doesn’t matter which of the hundreds of electric car producers ‘win’ to the mining companies who are supplying the rare earth minerals, copper, and steel that all of them will use as consumables in their process. Not to mention the copper required for a new charging infrastructure. Same for the tire manufacturers- which companies look best positioned to create the new rubbers of the next generation of vehicles, which ones are moving ahead on recycling old rubber and reducing the environmental impact of new rubber production- even if we eliminate fossil fuels the number of cars on the road is going to increase by a lot, and all of them will need tires. And every so often they’ll have to replace those tires with brand new ones. Which material science firms are best positioned to supply the new market with carbon composite body panels, upholstery fabric for interiors, plastics, adhesives, and fasteners for a post petroleum world. How about all the semi conductors we’ll need to make all the computer systems. How about those computer systems themselves, or the software IP that runs them- what about the companies that make the machines that make the machines to produce semiconductors, or cable, or stereo speakers? It’s fun to imagine you’re on a mythic quest to find the next Tesla- but the smart money looks at the historical data and tries to find common threads that make sense over time as the sector matures.

Even if they continue growing margins and grow to 10-20M EV sales per year by 2030, they won't justify a valuation higher than $1.5-3T by the end of the decade. So best case you're getting a 3x, but that's absolute best case. The real opportunity in Tesla is in robotaxis, Tesla Bot and AI in general.\n*  Legacy automakers: EVs are a negative for them. They can't produce them profitably yet, retrofitting existing factories to build EVs leaves them at a huge disadvantage to Tesla, and their balance sheets heavily rely on loans backed by ICE vehicles as collateral. If EVs continue do well, many of these companies will go bankrupt and the rest will have to go through multiple years of unprofitability. They're not investable until they get through that.\n* Start-up EV companies: These are not investable at all. They have yet to go through the two most difficult phases of a car company; ramping to mass production and getting to profitability. Both of these are almost impossible, as cars aren't profitable without economies of scale and a car company has trouble getting to profitability without the income that legacy OEMs have from service (having millions of cars on the road that need repairs). And the most important factor of all, unlike Tesla back in 2012-2019, they are not priced for bankruptcy, so the risk-reward is simply not there.\n\nSo ultimately, if you really want to invest in EVs, your only option is to go with Tesla. But that only makes sense if you're not looking for outsized returns or you believe they will succeed in the AI space.\n\nThe only real opportunity I could see that's still being overlooked is battery recycling.

The honeymoon from the Fed's money printing is over, at least for the common folk. We all got our stimmies, we rode the market up in '20-'21, but now a lot of us are left holding bags in ARK funds and the like. Institutional investors and Wall Street, I imagine, knew just when to enter and exit. Most retail investors didn't. It didn't help that there seemed to be common wisdom, unironically, that \"stocks go up\". People were bullied for daring to suggest that it's a good idea to be conservative, or that inflation might be transitory.\n\nWall Street is still riding the longest bull market ever, while retail investors are left holding bags in ARK funds and meme stocks, while at the same time are being hit by historically high inflation without accompanying wage increases. Just by browsing the comments around here I'm starting to see a pervasive attitude that this is all somehow unfair. And I agree with that attitude. It is unfair.I believe the Fed acted in earnest, and they truly believe that it was their job to put out the fires by using the money printer. I think it was necessary to begin with. But what I don't think was necessary was having the Fed be the only game in town. Why should American (and the world's) workforce be so vulnerable to lockdowns, recessions, and inflation while Wall Street enjoys the party of the century? It's not fair. And it makes no sense. Maybe we should be looking for solutions that help real people, and help the real economy.\n\nMaybe we shouldn't be afraid to ask why it's OK for people to go without health insurance, but it's not OK for Wall Street go without a bailout. Maybe we shouldn't be afraid to ask why financial markets in the USA haven't been able to function properly for nearly two decades without emergency monetary stimulus. Maybe we ought to ask why we put more value on the price of financial assets rather than on true, genuine innovation that leads to sustainability and prosperity for all.But we're not asking these things. Because the big guys who win elections, and their friends on Wall Street, don't care about them. They've made it through the past two decades swimmingly. Meanwhile we've had two bubbles burst, one of them leading to the greatest financial crisis in history, and a pandemic which has disproportionately hurt the common man. All of these things have left deep scars on the country and the world, yet we keep doing things like it's \"business as usual\". When are we going to wake up?\n\nI'm starting to feel a GME / Occupy style moment coming, where the common people band together and start to say that \"something is wrong here\".

Medicare pays based on a system called Relative Value Units (RVUs) which basically takes the amount of physician work, practice costs and malpractice insurance to determine the amount of resource used for each procedure.

The RVUs stay relatively static for a given procedure, while the rate per RVU is supposed to go up each year. This should provide enough to cover costs, but likely just barely for most practices. \n\nThe real kicker comes in when you realize that Medicare is funded through congressional appropriations, so I stead of actually paying those amounts they then apply a budget stabilization factor so that they can actually pay for all the services with the bucket of money they were given. As Medicare patients and procedures increase, the budget stabilization factor decreases paying less for the same work.\n\nThe difference is if you are Ina hospital facility, you are paid differently than in a practice, so the ability to generate profit is much greater. Therefore the best way to get a stable growing income as a physician is to switch to a hospital owner d practice.

All the transactions (left-hand side) have to equal the value of production (right-hand side).

What they did was assume that V is constant and ground in the habits of commerce – despite the empirical evidence which shows it is highly variable if not erratic. They also assume that Y will always be at full employment because they invoke flexible price models and assume market clearing – so they take Y to be fixed. This is a case of blind devotion to theory stopping the economist looking out the window and seeing regular periods when productive resources are anything but fully employment.\n\nBut with these assumptions – any child could then conclude that changes in M => directly lead to changes in P because with V assumed fixed the left-hand side is driven by M and if Y is assumed to always be at full employment then the only thing that can give on the right-hand side of the accounting identity is P.\n\nWhile first-year students struggle to learn this theory and think it is high science – it is almost mindless when you think about it.

The assertion that the real side of the economy (output and employment) are completely separable from the nominal (money) side and that prices are driven by monetary growth and growth and employment is driven wholly by the supply side (technology and population growth), rests on the assertion that the economy is always at full employment (quite apart from the nonsensical assumption that V is fixed)..\n\nAnyone with a brain could tell you that if business firms can respond to higher nominal spending (that is, higher $ demand) – either by increasing production or increasing prices or increasing both – and they cannot increase production any more (because the economy is at full employment) then they must increase prices to ration the demand.", "score": 0, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "Haha, the fed couldn’t give 2 flying fcks about the average person.

There is no inflation fairy that flits through stores at midnight raising prices, there are no magic market force pushing up prices with an invisible hand; there are only human decisions. That is why Economists can't tell you what has to happen to reduce inflation. Human decision making is slippery and they don't have the rules to predict it yet. They don't have first-principle explanations for any economic behavior. They are in worse shape than weather predicters were in 1750.

If our multilevel marketing approach to supplying products to customers means that a 0.5% increase in the cost of producing an item ALWAYS  results in a 5% price increase to the consumer, that won't be inflation, it will opportunism and we as individuals we learn to recognize it and decide accordingly.\n\nIn the first-principle view, the human-to-human decision act, fear is the primary player on both sided of the decision and the only always true financial prediction that can be made is that fear always makes things worse.", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "Well the thing is, there are many goods people cannot go without and, therefore, have no choice but to pay higher prices.

Raising interest rates also leads to higher interest rates in savings accounts which encourages people to save money instead of spending it. The current interest rates for savings accounts are laughable but if you look back during the 1970’s banks were paying 9%,10%,12% interest on savings accounts. Things like CD’s also start to have higher interest rates which leads to even more saving.\n\nAs more and more people save money, take less loans, use less credit cards the economy starts to slow down which cools off inflation.

Theoretically, raising interest rates helps reduce inflation, but I don’t see it materially changing anything for most people’s day to day lives. The exorbitant prices on consumer goods aren’t going away. The current system of CEOs managing to Wall Street will not allow it. Companies are expected to grow every quarter, price decreases since companies are expected to  grow every quarter, which is stupid and based on nothing other than greed. The guys in charge get the biggest pay out when stock is up, which encourages short-sighted decision making. Even if input costs go back down, companies can’t reduce their prices without simultaneously increasing volume demand by the same factor, just to stay flat to previous year.

This was already happening pre-Covid. There are only so much toothpaste or cars or computers or bananas that one person will buy. The only way to drive true demand is to grow population so that there are new people to buy things in our country, but that comes through increasing birth rates and/or immigration. Since our population is not growing, companies are driving “growth” on paper by: 1) reducing the amount of product in a package and charging the same price as the previously larger package (downsizing), 2) price increases and/or 3) planned obsolescence. Many companies are doing all of these at the same time. On paper, this shows sales and profitability growth for the company, but absolute volumes are still down. For example, the absolute number of diapers purchased in 2021 was down 3.2% compared to 2020, but dollar sales were up 0.9% (diapers did $36 billion in sales in 2021). The sales increase was from price increases and trading up to more premium products, which is somewhat being controlled by companies getting rid of value product offerings and focusing on premium, higher priced product offerings.

Graphics cards, Game systems and cars are more expensive because microchip are made in all of two countries that massively shut down at the start of the pandemic, cause a sustained shortage that lead to biding wars setting a new pricing standard. Everything from China is more expensive because containers are filled one way from the PRC to the USA, but there is little in this country that they want so $40,000 container ships have to be shuffled around, stacked in storage or recycled to get a few thousand dollars worth of goods to Amazon fulfillment centers.

{"title": "Russia could hit U.S. chip industry, White House warns", "selftext": "For those like me wondering why semis are getting hit particularly hard today.\n\nWASHINGTON, Feb 11 (Reuters) - The White House is warning the chip industry to diversify its supply chain in case Russia retaliates against threatened U.S. export curbs by blocking access to key materials, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nThe potential for retaliation has garnered more attention in recent days after Techcet, a market research group, published a report on Feb. 1 highlighting the reliance of many semiconductor manufacturers on Russian and Ukrainian-sourced materials like neon, palladium and others.\n\nAccording to Techcet estimates, over 90% of U.S. semiconductor-grade neon supplies come from Ukraine, while 35% of U.S. palladium is sourced from Russia.\n\nPeter Harrell, who sits of the White House's National Security Council, and his staff have been in touch with members of the chip industry in recent days, learning about their exposure to Russian and Ukrainian chipmaking materials and urging them to find alternative sources, the people said.\n\nThe White House declined to comment on the specifics of the conversations, but a senior official reiterated that the administration was prepared if Russia invaded Ukraine.\n\n\"Part of that is working with companies to make sure that if Russia takes actions that interfere with supply chains, companies are prepared for disruptions,\" the person said.\n\n\"We understand that other sources of key products are available and stand ready to work with our companies to help them identify and diversify their supplies.\"\n\nJoe Pasetti, vice president of global public policy at the chip and electronics manufacturing suppliers group SEMI, sent an email to members this week gauging exposure to the vital chipmaking supplies, according to a copy obtained by Reuters.\n\n\"As discussed on today's call, please see the attached document ... regarding Russian/Ukrainian production of a number of semiconductor materials,\" he wrote, referencing a summary by Techcet on C4F6, Palladium, Helium, Neon and Scandium from the troubled region. \"Please let me know if potential supply disruptions to any of them are a concern for your company.\"\n\nNeon, critical for the lasers used to make chips, is a biproduct of Russian steel manufacturing, according to Techcet. It is then purified in Ukraine. Palladium is used in sensors and memory, among other applications.\n\nThe Biden administration has threatened to impose sweeping export controls against Russia if it invades Ukraine. Russia, which has massed over 100,000 troops along Ukraine's border, denies it plans to attack.\n\nSome chipmakers have been reviewing their supply chains to scan for potential fallout from conflict in Ukraine. One person at a chipmaking company who declined to be named acknowledged that it has been looking into its supply of neon and other gases, some of which originate in Ukraine.\n\n\"Even if there was a conflict in Ukraine it wouldn't cut off supply. It would drive prices up,\" the person said. \"The market would constrict. Those gases would become pretty scarce. But it wouldn’t stop semiconductor manufacturing,\" he added.\n\nAccording to one power chip design startup executive, unrest in Ukraine has caused rare gas prices to increase and could cause supply issues. Fluorine is another gas that has a large supply from that part of the world and could be affected, the executive added.\n\nWilliam Moss, a spokesperson for Intel Corp , said the chipmaker was not anticipating any impact to neon supply.\n\nBut the issue is still concerning, because global chip supplies are tight and chip orders are only expected to pick up. Techcet estimates demand for all the materials will rise by more than 37% over the next 4 years, pointing to recent announcements by Intel, Samsung, and Taiwan's TSMC in Ohio, Arizona and Texas.\n\nNeon prices rose 600% in the runup to Russia's 2014 annexation of the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine, since chip firms relied on a few Ukrainian companies, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission.\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/technology/white-house-tells-chip-industry-brace-russian-supply-disruptions-2022-02-11/](https://www.reuters.com/technology/white-house-tells-chip-industry-brace-russian-supply-disruptions-2022-02-11/)", "id": "sq62oa", "created_utc": 1644604035.0, "score": 330, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 161, "comments": [{"body": "so buy the discount or wait ?", "score": 50, "replies": [{"body": "Your call, could be nothing.

You'll notice the charts have quite the steep fall, indicative of market panic. Lockdowns, an unknown virus. The business landscape suddenly became very unclear and ~~as such, there was a dash for cash. What this translates to is a credit crisis. The risk that no one wants to lend, and in a credit economy, this is disastrous. It means~~ the economy ground to a halt. If someone wants more in depth understanding of what it means to be a credit economy and how it works, I recommend watching this very famous but easy to follow video.\n\n[How The Economic Machine Works by Ray Dalio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHe0bXAIuk0)\n\nIn order to prevent this from happening, the Federal Reserve, also known as the lender of last resort, stepped in ~~to keep credit flowing~~ with looser monetary policy (EDIT: and in tandem with the Govt providing an extraordinary amount of fiscal stimulus), and without getting into specifics of how (a lot of different complex financial tools), they essentially \"pumped\" money into the economy (the real mechanisms are a bit more involved), providing support to financial institutions, households, employers, etc. Wrapped up under one giant umbrella, this would be called Quantitative Easing, or QE from the monetary side. The Federal Reserve also cut interest rates to spur on consumer spending and borrowing, trying to kickstart an economy that suddenly came to a standstill. As of this morning, the Federal Reserve is still injecting liquidity into the economy. This is part of the problem. Between the govt and central bank, they pumped so much money into the system to save it, which at the time was required, but the Federal Reserve have failed to put the brakes on QE, and system now has so much money, and it has for some time. Edit: Paired with fiscal stimulus, and low interest rates, the consumer had a lot of spending power.\n\nWhile this fiscal stimulus paired with monetary policy initially saved the economy, what ended up transpiring was that there were was too much money, chasing too few goods. In economics it's called Demand Pull Inflation.  Things were sold out. Good luck trying to buy a pool, or workout gear, this was very evident early on. The initial notion was that this would pass eventually as the world got back to normal. Except, a supply chain crisis emerged. Sometimes I like to laugh and think that the Evergreen Ship was the start of it all, but regardless, there was too much money, now chasing even fewer goods, and this supply chain crisis has persisted. There are some that think that inflation will taper off when supply chains sort themselves out, but the economy is dynamic, and there is more than one source of inflation. Edit: When supply chains sort themselves out, this is generally seen as deflationary, which is why the Fed used the term \"transitory\" so often in 2021. As supply chain issues have persisted, it hasn't been as transitory as they thought it would be. The long term projections are that this source of inflation will drop, but it still remains prolonged in the current economic environment.\n\nThis is where people were caught off guard with recent inflation readings, why is inflation still rising if supply chain induced inflation is transitory and the chain is working through its issues?  Well, long term, the supply inflation will be transitory, but as it stands, it remains, and this is where we introduce another source of inflation emerging called Cost- Push inflation. This is where inflation occurs because the cost of labor and inputs (raw materials for example) go up. These have been going on for a while, and no one really thought it was an issue, until now. I had inklings that this was happening the moment I saw a sort of mini workers movement occurring, with wages being driven upwards. And, due to the prolonged nature of these supply chain issues driven by a variety of issues, paired with a still very strong consumer, and now accelerating battles for labor at ever increasing costs, many companies are passing on the costs of inflation to consumers. It's why these companies have been able to post some crazy profits, Tyson Foods for example had a blowout earnings. It's because meat at the market is so expensive now. The average person experiences this at the pump, or rents increasing. So, to sum it up, We got here because a confluence of bizarre events, extraordinary fiscal stimulus from the federal government empowering the consumer to consume more, and a Fed that was slow to move on reacting to \"transitory\" inflation, and is still pumping liquidity into a market that no longer needs it, all with still very low interest rates still spurring on consumer demand. The American economy is super heated and needs to be slowed down.\n\nSo, where does that leave us? Well, supply chains will eventually sort themselves out this is true. But the issue is will it alleviate enough to offset the rise in inflation from other sources in the immediate term? The Russia-Ukraine issue has exacerbated the energy crisis, with Biden now considering releasing Strategic Reserves to help american oil supply and alleviate some of the pain felt at the pump. The Fed has to do something about insanely high inflation, but they are hamstrung on the supply side because, well, monetary policy doesn't solve that type of inflation. But, Cost-Push inflation is still happening, and overall inflation is still rising, so they now have to consider raising rates, not to fix supply issue related inflation, ~~but to crush demand, something called demand destruction~~  but to slow the economy down with interest rates. It's why this year will be so tumultuous. Because if done wrong, it can lead to a recession. Too much slowing too fast, and GDP will drop as consumers consume/spend less as they borrow less since rising rates makes it more expensive to borrow. There are technical definitions for a recession but the general idea is that GDP drops. And if GDP drops, then company earnings have dropped, and thus company stock prices drop as they are not as valuable. The market is forward looking, and that's why you're seeing such crazy re-ratings across the board at the slightest hint of where the economy and Fed will go.\n\nThanks for sticking around to read this. lol.\n\nEDIT: I didn't think this would gain this much traction, so I feel the need to convey that I generalized a lot of complex topics quickly and mostly just touched on some inflation stuff. In the bigger picture, interest rates and the Feds decision to raise or lower them have a profound impact on the economy, and there are two sides to the inflation story, one from the Monetary Policy side, and one from the Fiscal Policy side. I really do suggest people watch that video I linked , [duplicated here](https://youtu.be/PHe0bXAIuk0) . This video will help situate my post a lot better once you get a basic understanding of how money moves through the economy. I've no doubt glossed over some big topics, and probably forgot to mention a few others, maybe misused a term here or there, but I hope the broader strokes got through as the broad stokes was the goal.

Now, the same container runs $20,000.\nIf we take the average seafood item that is imported from Asia, roughly 10,000 cases could be in that container (it keeps the math simple anyways). So that meant our shipping freight was about $0.20 per case. Now, it is about $2.00 per case (a 900% increase). So if we look at the shipping freight, it is contributing $1.80 to our cost increase per case of the $5.92 that we've seen food cost inputs go up on an average case of food ($39.21 Nov 21 case price - $33.29 Nov 19 case price). So to put that into perspective 30% ($1.80/$5.92) is coming from just shipping price increases! This type of freight increases effects all of items across the board regardless of resin shortages, product shortages or other labor issues and that is before we account for the trucking freight! So you can have multiple inflation points. And this is just one case. Even if interests rates go down, you're not going to be able to lower the 30% increase in cost inputs. \n\nNow what happened?\n\nIt's almost a perfect storm. Companies borrowed to pay dividends or, more common anyways, share buy back programs because the cost of borrowing was so cheap (no interest really). So when a company needs money for projects, M&A or capital investment they look at their financing options like floating debt (bonds), issuing more shares (diluting investors) or other options which is commonly referred to in Corporate finance as the weighted average cost of capital (or WACC for short). Over 7,000 US publicly tcompanies traded are not profitable and many of them have way too much debt... And they don't have the cash flow to pay their debt if they suffer a sudden unexpected business interruption like the pandemic caused. So basically in March 2020, many famous companies you've heard of like Hertz, Boeing, Delta, United, American Airlines, McDonald's, 3M would have all gone bankrupt if they couldn't float debt. Without the Federal Reserve coming in and preventing a credit crisis... All these companies cash flows would have been insufficient to pay their debts. Between March and May of 2020, the Fed inserted 4 Trillion dollars into the economy... And this is before we discuss things like PPP/EIDL loans and the HEROES Act and the CARES Act. And the Fed just hasn't stopped. The problem is that the Fed believes the recession from the great financial crisis was a result of not acting fast enough and large enough. So they acted faster, instead of taking time to make a plan, and carpet bombed the economy with more money than it could ever actually consume... Which caused a banner year for housing prices and stocks. But meanwhile, nearly all of the fundamentals on these assets and companies had gotten worse not better... So why were they suddenly worth more? This set of circumstances is what we call inflation. Warren Buffett made the remark on the 2020 BRK earnings call in May that all the companies who went to the bond market to issue debt to survive owe the Fed a thank you note for saving their business.", "score": 39, "replies": [{"body": "Do you have any posts on how you are navigating this market with your portfolio?", "score": 8, "replies": []}, {"body": "Wow you’ve explained it so well thanks!", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "You're welcome", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Would be very interested to get your take on where all of this plus the supply chain/inventory issues will lead the housing market this year.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Well the supply chain issues are here for at least 2022 and probably Q1 of 2023. I don't see how they can be lessen any quicker. At this point, it is clear that for many things like medicine and chips, we need to recreate local manufacturing.\n\nAs for how it relates to housing, I'm not sure. I don't think anyone has a good answer for this one. I'll focus on the US. The US has the best systems available for loan attainment for large purchases, protections under the law and least risk of the assets losing value. You have two assets (the land itself) and the structure that sits upon it. The reality is also that the US has least protections for its citizens. Any foreign investor can buy without any trouble and the reverse is rarely true in reverse for most of the rest of the world without big corporations, significant power or huge levels of income (usually without loans). It makes things tricky since on a macro level, the US is already short 5 Million homes. And Airbnb has fundamentally changed the RE game since now an asset can have a high vacany rate if the higher rental income offsets it. However, the cost inputs for new construction have also changed. It now costs the same to build 2 houses in 2022 that it cost to build 15 in 2015 (labor, lumber, steel, copper etc have all gone up). In addition to the inflation and lower supply, the demand has increased from both foreign investors, hedgefunds and algo companies (even though Zillow failed, it is but one of many). Historically, RE is the protection against inflation as it used to be inversely correlated with the stock market. Although this has not been true for decades. Since it is now correlated with the stock market, and requires such capital investment and labor, one is left to wonder if REITs aren't a better outlet given their diversification which might protect from the office space situation as remote work takes over. I don't think anyone can predict the short term on real estate and so much of it is dependent on local areas (which can often be protected from greater macro factors). However, the interest rates will go up and those with adjustable rate mortgages may find themselves unable to pay even the small new ask. So I'd expect there always to be deals available if you're financial sound and on the lookout.

In its purest form, two things happen when a price increases: a seller decides to increase his asking price and a buyer decides to pay that price. If either doesn't happen, there is no price increase. \n\nLots of things can drive those decisions but the most active driver is fear.  \n\nLook at it from the seller's side - if the price he pays for whatever he is selling goes up, he is afraid that if he doesn't raise his price, he will lose money. He may decide that he can absorb that increase and not increase his price at all. Or he may feel he needs to maintain his income at the present level and increase his price by exactly the same amount as his price increased - penny for penny. Or he may see his competitors increasing their prices and be afraid that they will make more money than he will and increase his price even more. Or he may see the fear in the buyers and raise his price as much as the market will bear, fearing he will miss a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to get rich.\n\nBut I think the more powerful fear effect is on the buyer side. Buyers accept a price because they are afraid of not getting what they are trying to buy. The prospect of not having bread makes them very accepting of high bread prices. The prospect of not having gasoline makes them very accepting of high gas prices. The prospect of not having underwear makes them very accepting of high underwear prices.\n\nThe active word here is **fear**. In our present situation, both sides are afraid - the sellers afraid of not getting enough money for their sales and the buyer afraid of not getting that which they need or value highly.\n\nAny policy aimed at affecting those price decisions is ultimately aimed (in one form or another) at reducing those fears. \n\nAnd the fear doesn't have to local economic fears, any fear will do. When outside forces are lurking about, like Russia and the Ukraine or trucker protests or a rebel attack on an oil field, fear goes up and inflation goes up with it.", "score": 0, "replies": []}, {"body": "Repatriation of domestic profits.

Bond investors leave the bond market en mass in search of a safe return.\n\n2001-2007- the mortgage backed security markets is born.  The massive exodus of bond market money creates excessive demand for mortgage backed securities and housing market bubble.\n\n2008- the housing bubble bursts.  \n\n2009-2020- Tax money is used to rescue the banking industry.  The FED purchases the most toxic assets from the banks via TARP.  Ressesion seems likely.  The FED cannot reduce interest rates anymore because the are already at zero.  The FED initiates a buying program called quantitative easing, where they print money in order to make purchases in the bond and mortgage backed securities markets.  This program keeps substantial artificial buying pressure in these markets and keeps interest rates near zero, forcing all other rational investors to seak a return elsewhere.  (Stocks?) The FED has been accumulating these assets for this entire time so they hold a lot of assets.  What is $9M multiplied by 1M?  I think this is 9 quadrillion dollars.  This is the total assets held on the FED's balance sheet right now.  Again, this money, roughly 8 quadrillion dollars, has been used to purchase bonds and mortgage backed securities since 2009 when the program began.  \n\n2020- the pandemic hits and world governments purposely stop almost all economic activity.  The FED prints trillions additional dollars, on top of the ongoing printing for the quantitative easing program.  This emergency relief money, however, is distributed to businesses and citizens.  This money, unlike, the QE money, circulates in the free market and it is an unprecedented amount of money competing for scarce resources which have become more scarce since mandated economic shutdown.\n\n2021- most normal people see prices of everything increasing at an alarming rate.  The FED, financial media and political leaders, however, explain that this is transitory.  It will pass.  Additional emergency relief programs are proposed, some are approved others fail.  All money is printed by the FED, not collected through taxes.  This printed money is then distributed in the real economy adding to the inflationary spiral.\n\nDecember 2021- the FED formally acknowledges that this inflation is not transitory.  The FED formally announces plans to end quantitative easing \"and\" plans to begin removing assets from their 9 quadrillion dollar balance sheet.  In addition, the FED plans to raise interest rates fairly quickly over the next year.\n\nBreak\n\nSo here we are.

I studied a lot of monetary and fiscal policy at St Andrews:\n\n1. Huge increases in the money supply caused by:\n a) massive central bank asset purchases(Quantitative Easing); where they exchanged newly created reserves for government and corporate debt. This generated liquidity in markets improving the ability to buy and sell bonds\n\nb)low interest rates set by central banks (means it's very cheap to borrow) which encourages people who have lots of savings to spend, since they get low returns on bank deposits\n\nC)he purchases of government bonds gave governments nearly limitless amounts debt with very low interest rates, this meant they could spend insane amounts of money pushing citizens to spend since costs and programmes were giving them extra cash, meaning they keep the economy afloat\n\n2. When more money is chasing less goods inflation goes up; high money supply, low demand means good prices go up as people willing to spend more\n\n3. QE and low interest rates also helped push asset prices up (stocks and bond prices up; bond yields down as inverse to prices). This makes people feel richer i.e. more willing to spend on goods! \n\na) lots of spending in an economy means that companies will make more profit as consumers and other companies have lots of money. This makes their earning reports good, pushing up their stock prices\n\nb) credit is cheap, meaning companies can borrow more money to grow, and have to pay less interest on their debt. Increasing economy growth, pay workers higher wages, increasing wage inflation, giving workers more money\n\nC) extra money from government stimulus makes consumers want to invest, less things to pay for pushing up asset prices further. This in turn leads to greater expansion further pushing up expectations of expansion and good prices going up! \n\n2am in the UK so apologies if innacurate!

The second the increased unemployment ended it should have rectified if it was an issue, some states even ended it early and they still have worker issues. It's far more complicated than that.

The benefits were too generous and lasted too long.     The constant bashing on Twitter by Democrats(Warren, Reiche etc), the NTSB investigations, lawsuits....these do not occur in a vacuum.   They are all borne of the general hostility of Democrats towards Tesla.  A large component of market dynamics is psychological.  If people do not trust their leadership to make good economic decisions, they will be reluctant to invest.   Then there is the never-ending identity politics from this administration.   Everything is framed in terms of race/racial justice.  He was supposed to govern as a moderate but instead is causing division and animosity.\n\nAs to Ukraine.  Listen to the Q and A sessions with Macron and other people negotiating on behalf of NATO.  Russian Insight is a good resource on YouTube.  Putin does make some legitimate points.  Russia does not want missiles on his doorsteps just as we didn't want missiles in Cuba.  This is not to say I support or completely trust Putin, I don't.

Lol, fix news is saying it's not our issues and we shouldnt get involved and Ukraine must have some dirt on him. Trump was begging the g7 to include Russia again ffs. I understand you don't like Trump either but Jesus.\n\nAnyhow, politics is fucked, but remember what Putin has been doing already, invaded Ukraine, poisoning ex nationals, being abrasive in Syria, meddling in us elections.

NATO isn't keen on this.  \n  \nLong version: The European Plain means that everything east of Germany is basically undefendable since there's no natural obstacles, so Russia has historically (and understandably) liked to push its borders as far 'out' as it could.  With the fall of the Soviet Union, the borders were pushed further back (mostly East) than they've been in over a century.  \nRussia acts like a dick to its neighbours, and they're not keen on being client States to it again, so some joined NATO.  This displeased Russia greatly because now foreign troops can be on its doorstep which doesn't make Moscows military planners happy.  \nUkraine is the only European country that borders Russia (apart from Belarus, which is again almost a Russian client State) that is *not* in NATO (plus Finland which is neutral but is apparently starting to weigh its options), and it has a large ethnically Russian population (mostly west of the Dnieper River), so can be seen as the easiest location to push back against NATO.  \nProblem for Russia is that Ukraine has got its shit together (in a military sense) in the last few years and is potentially not going to be a pushover anymore (Russia can probably take out the organised military in a couple of weeks to a few months, but insurgencies are a thing, and even 200k troops isn't going to be enough to stop that) and individual NATO countries are supplying it stuff with \"This End Towards Enemy\" printed on them.  \nCompounding things is that Europe gets a lot (most?) of its gas supply (for heating etc) from Russia.  Russia needs that money almost as much as Europe needs the gas.  \n  \nWhat I *think* Putin actually wants from this in the short-term is not to actually invade Ukraine (or if they do it'll be limited to the south-east so they have a land route to the Crimean Peninsula), but to get some diplomatic concessions from NATO and the EU at large.

{"title": "Why Tesla investors need to believe in FSD - what will happen if FSD don't succeed by 2025", "selftext": "*The short version:*\n\n**To catch the wave of EV adoption I believe is coming 2025 - 2026, Tesla needs to announce 3-4 new gigafactories specifically intended for 25k car by next year at the latest so they can be up and running by 2025. Tesla needs to unveil the 25k car 2024 at the latest so they can begin production 2025. But since Elon is a rather risk inclined person we won't see this, instead Elon prioritizes a project like Tesla bot over the 25k car, he is leaving a near-certain profit to hunt a bigger uncertain profit. By focusing on both FSD  and the Bot Elon made the stock much riskier. I believe it would be much better balanced if 25k car took precedence over the Bot.**\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*The background:*\n\nAfter last conference call and after prioritizing the tesla bot over the 25k car, tesla stock became a stock with higher risk but also higher potential reward. Assume you are investing in a 5-year time horizon. You would at least hope for the stock to go up to 1600 by 2027 when you presumably cash out your investment. If Tesla FSD succeeds, meaning fsd reach level 4 automation, the tesla stock would surge above 1600 no doubt, especially if Tesla is first with level 4 automation. I dont think I need to write the enormous benefits if level 4 automation happens. With FSD tesla dont need 25k car because the demand will be near unlimited.\n\nBut what if FSD don't succeed? Then it doesn't make sense to invest in tesla here is why.  By 2027 Tesla main streams of profit would most likely be, energy storage, cybertruck, model 3 and model Y. Without 25k car I dont believe there is a demand for more than 3-4m cars. I expect following scenario to roughly play out:\n\nBy 2024 I expect the luxury segment (60k+) to be dominated by BEVs, but in cheap cars less than 30k, the BEV will only be a small minority 10-15% of all sales due to battery and chips shortage. However, by 2025 I expect the chip shortage to be solved at the latest, 30+ fabs will have begun or begin their construction 2021/2022 and most of these will produce wafers by 2024/2025. When it comes to battery cells constraints we have 50+ new battery plants that are coming online assumingly around 2024/2025 in Europe and US alone: [https://insideevs.com/news/517931/europe-plans-38-battery-factories/](https://insideevs.com/news/517931/europe-plans-38-battery-factories/) [https://electrek.co/2021/12/27/13-battery-gigafactories-coming-us-2025-ushering-new-era/](https://electrek.co/2021/12/27/13-battery-gigafactories-coming-us-2025-ushering-new-era/)\n\nSo 2022 and 2023 will be rather unimpressive EV sales for legacy automakers, but Tesla should see nice increase in sales in 2022, 2023 should be an exciting year for Tesla assuming no further delays of cybertruck. 2024 will be the year Tesla sell around 3m cars and also the year Tesla finally meet demand. Though we probably see good numbers 2024 for Tesla, but with no success in FSD, tesla bot, solar, Tesla growth is in jeopardy and I wouldn't be surprised if the stock is below 500 in 2024. Then we finally arrive to 2025, the year we will see a great supply of chips and batteries, the perfect year for mass adoption of cheap EVs. I project a big wave will come 2025 and 2026. If we compare the global BEV sales in 2024 with 2026 I believe we will see a double in sales in two years. Roughly I believe BEVs will do roughly 20% 2024 and at least 40% in 2026 thanks to mass adoption of cheap BEVs 18-28k.\n\nSince Elon is not prioritizing the 25k when can we expect 25k to be unveiled? Well Elon has said to make a compelling 25k car, Tesla need to work on the card diligently for 3 years. I think its fair to assume that Tesla started to work on 25k car seriously sometime in 2020 and dropped the project sometime in 2021. That leaves tesla with two more years of work before they can unveil the car. Tesla certainly wont begin working on the 25k car in 2022, they probably either will begin working on 25k car in 2023 or 2024. Lets assume they start working again on the 25k car sometime in 2023, this mean they will unveil the car at the earliest 2025 with production earliest 2026. Realistically speaking we wont see any real mass production until 2027. Tesla will miss the wave. the legacy automakers will share the cheap car segment between themselves 2025-2026 and as Tesla arrives in 2027 they will need to give up a sizeable chunk of that segment to Tesla. However Tesla would have grabbed a much bigger share if they arrived two years earlier. I believe if Tesla worked hard  they could have unveiled 25k car by 2023 with production already in 2024!

If we assume same capacity for 3 as Fremont and Shanghai of about 300k vehicles a year and use the 250k per year production target number for Cybertruck from the last earnings call, then the existing Austin building has base capacity of >1m vehicles once all equipment is installed. \n\nThen consider Berlin has only one of three planned assembly halls (3/Y/25k car?) completed on that site so far, also at 500k capacity. So if we do the bare minimum and x3 that number for the 3 and an unspecified future model then that site has >1.5m capacity once fully built out.

It seems you guys know better than the Tesla leadership because they certainly want to make model 2. A 30k model 3 would be the most selling Tesla by far, 80 percent of all Teslas would be the Tesla 30k. \n\nA much better idea would be to keep model 3 at least 40k and make 25k car. The 25k car would be Teslas best selling car by far outselling even a hypothetical 30k. You would sell more of an 25k car than a model 30k and you will make a bigger profit of a 25k than a model 30k car. If this doesnt convince you why you should make an model 2 car let me give you another strong argument. By making model 2 for 25k and keeping model 3 at minimum 40k.

Model 2 addresses far more of that market. \n\nTake my car for example. It's a dodge ICE, 23 years old, rusting, $1000 to buy, $2000 a year in gas, $1000 a year in upkeep.

There are millions like me. \n\nTesla has the resources to produce a prototype M2. It wouldn't have to be badged as a Tesla; it could have a new brand name or be offered as a joint venture with a legacy company or a chinese company.  It doesn't need 300 miles of range, 100 miles of actual range is plenty on most days. It doesn't need to seat 6; 2 people and a bag of groceries is enough. Fewer bells and whistles so fewer chips. So it can be smaller and lighter and use half or less the batteries at half the price while keeping high margins. It's a platform for a possible sale of $12k self-driving.  Maybe its not 10 times safer than the ice car it replaces, at least twice as safe would be an improvement. A Y spends most of its energy hauling dead weight around; this would avoid that. A smaller lighter car would need less batteries, so it could be smaller and lighter and thereby cheaper. If it's smaller and lighter, solar panels could add extra miles of range.\nAnd that's just the first year; subsequent years could improve. \nPrototype in 2023 and production in 2024 is possible, but tesla is known for delay so let's just say someday.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "The bot brings on a lot of talented engineers and AI expertise.\n\nThe bot isn't a distraction, it is a flywheel for FSD/Robotaxis (25k car)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "So many false assumptions here.

That's what I meant when I said they wouldn't be allowed to open the position to begin with. If they opened it in the way described, then they would never have been allowed to have buying power reduced such that the short is not cash-secured any more.\n\n>You still can’t lose more than the width of the spread. Must have a f up broker.\n\nI don't feel like you understand the risk in this scenario. This is not a problem with early assignment. They were liquidated on the day of expiry. This is pin risk, where you do not have the luxury of seeing if you can exercise the long option, and the broker is unwilling to take on the risk on behalf of the client.\n\nOP is holding a put credit spread at 840/845. If the broker ***thinks*** there is a chance that TSLA ends the day between those strikes, OP is obligated to purchase those shares with capital he doesn't have. The long put expires worthless so it doesn't matter. Since OP doesn't have enough capital, broker liquidates for them before they can get into a situation where they have a large negative cash balance.\n\nNow add to it the scenario where TSLA drops after hours, to whatever, say 800. Because TSLA closed above 840, there is no automatic exercise of the long option you're relying on as protection. A savvy trader might look at the after-hours movements and call in to exercise their long as a protection (since they have an hour and half after market close to decide to exercise), but the broker doesn't know if OP will do that. Therefore, a trader caught in that position can absolutely lose more than the width of the spread.

Schultz.\nFor automakers, this year’s Super Bowl might as well be called the Electric Bowl. \n\nStartup electric vehicle brand Polestar today confirmed it will run an ad in the game that is already filled with spots from Kia, BMW, General Motors and Nissan—which are all pitching EVs with expensive celebrity-filled ads. There is even an electric vehicle charger maker in the game: Wallbox, whose Big Game ad doubles as its first-ever TV commercial in the U.S.\n\nNever before have so many auto brands spent so much money advertising vehicles with such small market share—EVs only accounted for 2.6% of new vehicle sales last year in the U.S., according to Edmunds. But the Super Bowl marketing onslaught is indicative of a tipping point in the EV sector, which is poised to finally begin creeping into the mainstream after years of hype. Automakers have billions of dollars riding on it. GM alone has said it plans to pour $35 billion in electric and autonomous vehicle development through 2025, while debuting 30 new EVs globally, with two-thirds available in North America.\n\nWith that kind of investment, brands must start generating demand—lots of it. And there is no bigger stage to do that than the Super Bowl, which draws about 100 million American viewers from all corners of the country. \n\n'The race is far from over'\n\nOf course, Tesla—the biggest EV player with an estimated 65% U.S. market share—scoffs at such paid advertising, as it continues to set sales records fueled by word-of-mouth marketing often powered by its attention-seeking CEO, Elon Musk. But traditional automakers and startups see an opening, and marketing will play a critical role as they seek to dethrone Musk.\n\n“Despite Tesla's significant head start on the competition, the race is far from over,” Jessica Caldwell, executive director of insights at Edmunds, said in an email interview. “Automakers are eager to imprint their EV messages on the mind of the American consumer while there is ample market share to be earned, and there are still few better places to commence an awareness campaign than the Super Bowl.”\n\nEdmunds, which provides car shopping information to consumers, forecasts the EV market to grow to 4% this year.\n\nWith their Big Game buys, legacy auto brands are going Hollywood, using casts of big-name celebs to entertain the masses, while subtly pushing messages that their new fleets of EVs—many of which are just hitting the market—match, if not exceed, the performance of gas-powered cars.\n\nBMW is calling on the power of Greek god Zeus, played by Arnold Schwarzenegger, to push its new iX SUV, which hits dealerships in March. The 60-second spot, which comes from Goodby Silverstein & Partners and will air in the first quarter, portrays the weather god and sender of thunder and lightning growing bored with retirement in Palm Springs, California before he perks up when his wife Hera, played by Salma Hayek Pinault, gets him the electric BMW. The lightning-filled spot ends with a new twist on the German luxury brand’s classic tagline—The Ultimate Electric Driving Machine.\n\nBMW was among the first brands to push its EV ambitions with a Super Bowl ad, running a spot in 2015 for its i3 hatchback. It starred Katie Couric and Bryant Gumbel, flashing back to 1994 when the then-\"Today Show\" hosts struggled with the concept of the internet. The spot then flashed forward as the duo pondered the improbability of electric cars—specifically BMW’s i3, which was considered a pioneering EV at the time.\n\nBut the sales needle barely moved for traditional auto brands in the ensuing years, with dealerships dominated by combustion-engine cars bought by people who remained skeptical about EVs because of their higher price tags and so-called “range anxiety”—the fear the cars can’t get you where you want to go on a single charge.\n\nMarketing obstacles\n\nThose concerns remain hurdles. A recent survey from global consulting firm AlixPartners found that just 10% of U.S. consumers would be willing to pay 25% more for an EV than a gas-powered car. Also, 32% of “moderately and very likely” U.S. EV buyers called public charging availability “critical” to the purchase of an EV. \n\nPublic and workplace charging units in the U.S. would need to grow from about 216,000 in 2020 to 2.4 million by 2030 to support 26 million electric vehicles on the road, according to a report this past summer from the International Council of Clean Transportation. The report notes that there were 1.8 million EVs on the road at the end of 2020, while basing its estimates on a forecast of EV sales representing 36% of all vehicle sales in 2030.\n\nThat type of demand could be coming, despite years of sluggish EV growth. AlixPartners’ survey found that so-called “battery electric vehicle believers”—those very likely to buy a battery-electric as their next vehicle—have more than doubled in the past two years, from 11% to 25% globally and from 5% to 19% in the U.S.\n\n“The EV market is inevitable—it’s a question of when, not if,” Mark Wakefield, global co-leader of the automotive and industrial practice at AlixPartners, said in an interview. “You’ve seen China explode, you’ve seen Europe explode, and so the automakers look at the U.S. as a market that is maybe not there yet but it’s going to get closer to its inflection point,” he said. Automakers are spending “hundreds of billions on electric vehicles so they need to have demand for these things.”\n\nGM began pushing its EVs in last year’s game with its “Everybody In” campaign that aims to democratize EVs.  This year’s ad from McCann stars Mike Myers reprising his Dr. Evil role from the “Austin Powers” movie franchise. \n\nA teaser released Wednesday flicks at the range anxiety issue by promoting the automaker’s proprietary Ultium battery platform, which the company has touted as enabling the construction of a range of EVs at different price points, including some that can get in excess of 300 miles on a full charge. In the video, Dr. Evil suggests they can get “one million” miles, in reference to his classic movie line.\n\nThe Super Bowl spot is expected to make a reference to how EVs are environmentally friendly. “The younger audience is extremely purpose-driven and it’s important to understand the connection to that,” GM Global Chief Marketing Officer Deborah Wahl said in an interview.\n\n“When we go to this EV world we want to make sure that it is equitable and inclusive for everybody,” she added, noting that GM’s EVs cover a broad prive range, from a $30,000 Chevy Equinox expected in 2023 to six-figure Hummer EV that began sales last year.\n\nHalo effect\n\nBut Super Bowl marketing is about more than plugging specific EV models—automakers see the ads as a corporate image play. \n\nIt is a “halo that helps us drive desirability for the entire BMW brand,”said Uwe Dreher, BMW’s VP of marketing for North America. “This is the hot topic right now because it helps you in regards to creating awareness for your electric lineup. But it also helps you, of course, from a positioning point of view. Electric cars are seen as something that defines the future, something that exists with lots of innovations, and these are all beautiful themes and areas we want to be associated with at BMW.”\n\nThe perception plays extend well beyond Super Bowl Sunday, including on channels geared at younger buyers. \n\nKia—whose Super Bowl ad plugs its new electric vehicle, the EV6, by introducing Robo Dog, a plug-in puppy that chases the EV6 in search of a charge—is accompanying the spot with a range of digital marketing. That includes what the brand calls its first-ever TikTok integration featuring a video of the electric pooch.\n\nPolestar, a Swedish premium electric vehicle startup, is countering the gimmicks with a no-nonsense ad that promises “no stunts, no surprises, no supermodels … no puppies, no monkeys, no babies,” according to its teaser. The brand, which has ties to Volvo, plans to launch one new electric vehicle per year in the next three years, starting with Polestar 3 in 2022.\n\nLeaning into search ads\n\nBut the task of converting the awareness driven by the Super Bowl campaigns into actual EV purchases will require more diligent, tactical marketing. Because most EV buyers are first-time EV buyers, they thirst for educational information—much more so than regular car buyers.\n\n“When it comes to electric cars you have to provide much more information on your own website,” said Dreher. “You don’t want people to Google these things and end up on other third-party websites.” \n\nAs a result, BMW spends a lot of money on search advertising, in hopes of luring shoppers to a special EV hub on its site that includes visuals and information aimed at overcoming range anxiety. One section promotes the iX as getting 324 miles on a single charge below a map showing the distance between Los Angeles and Las Vegas as a 270-mile trip.\n\nBMW collects first-party data at the site that is used to retarget potential buyers with more personalized marketing on social channels. “We want to keep them in our ecosystem,” Dreher said. “Because they will have tons of questions.”", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "> “When it comes to electric cars you have to provide much more information on your own website,” said Dreher. “You don’t want people to Google these things and end up on other third-party websites.”\n\n👌", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "“Please don’t google our EVs”", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Also a good take 🤣", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Hah!

When taxes are adjusted to offset the increase in aggregate demand, deficit spending is not inflationary. \n\nRemember, taxes and the raising of interest rates act as the brakes on the economy; spending and expansionary monetary policy are like the gas pedal. The \"debt\" has little impact on our situation, because the vast majority of our debt is denominated in dollars. The Treasury Department, in cooperation with the Federal Reserve, could wipe out that debt tomorrow by issuing a flood of new dollars. The inflationary effect of such an action could be countered immediately by contracting the supply through interest rates and taxes.\n\nA balanced budget is fine, but that is a much better plan when the economy is healthy, standing on its own two feet, and producing growth independently. In times of crisis, recession and recovery, deficits aren't just good for the economy, they're necessary. Government spending is what drives the economy when it collapses, and it is paid down later through currency manipulation which has the effect of taking the training wheels off. Government debt is very different from consumer debt. It's not like balancing a checkbook at home. The entire system revolves around controlling the money supply. \n\nTo solve this inflation, I think it is prudent to examine what the actual effects of this inflationary period are. It has boosted wage growth at the fastest rate in recent memory, it is stimulating growth due to the large amount of currency in the system, and it is filling up the holes left by COVID. The cause is more supply disruption than it is deficit spending. Many goods and commodities are in short supply and therefore soaring in price, not because of an actual shortage, but because of labor shortages, which are indeed transitory. This means prices will normalize over time as COVID becomes less disruptive. If the Fed decides to raise rates aggressively, they risk choking a fairly healthy economy that has just started to stand on its own. That could cause a severe recession that would rival the GFC.
