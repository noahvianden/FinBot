China needs to know that their economic prowess in cheap labour can be turned off causing their billion people population to rise up quickly.\n\nThis is the only play, and I’m surprised US and EU are playing nice to save a few million Europeans (not saying that they shouldn’t be saved, just the cost of not doing a strong punitive action will be much higher and still will impact the millions they are trying to save now)\n\nFYI some posters below (just like when posts about Russia possibly will invade) are posting “xyz does this all the time”. Obviously China does this to Taiwan all the time. If you can see that thr fucking world is operating on a war footing right now, or can’t fucking open your eyes, stop posting that or telling me I don’t know the history of China / Taiwan history.

The planned rate hikes are intended to fix our inflation problem. Russia invading Ukraine and the associated sanctions that will follow are an additional inflationary shock (check commodities markets on wheat right now, for example). The magnitude of the effect is debatable, but this leans towards making inflation worse, so the read-through is an increase in the necessity of rate hikes, not a decrease. \n\nThe only way the war results in fewer hikes is if this hits the economy so hard that the Fed gives up on fighting inflation to save employment and retirement funds. PCE data from this week don't indicate imminent recession, so the Fed is going to hike.

The implication of this technical 'bounce' is that it should be transient and short lived. Do you think this will be the case and we'll see the downtrend continue or is it probable this could be a sustained level?", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "I'm not going to bullshit you here, the answer is nobody knows. The reason spreads are wide enough to drive a truck through right now is because very few players are out there actually trading this market. Those that are active are trading on very short timeframes, because a news headline can torpedo your position at any moment. Forget about predicting what the market is going to do in a month or a week. We barely know what's going to happen in a few hours. \n\nFace-ripping rallies in correction or bear markets are nothing new. They happen all the time, at least partially because of the negative gamma structure in dealer hedging that happens whenever stocks are trending down. You are correct, they usually blow over in a couple of days and stocks resume on their way down. This happens because dip-buyers, or retail, or some of the more adventurous family offices hop on these gamma squeezes for a day or two, some take profits, and then exit. They either run out of money or risk appetite (the overall macro picture is unchanged and remains negative, after all) and eventually after the bounce has overextended, anyone left in the long trade is left holding the bag. \n\nUnless, of course, the big institutional boys decide the correction is over and step in to buy. Fund managers are like lemmings. They all mostly buy the same stuff at the same time, and the reason is pretty simple. Over a long time horizon, the market generates pretty good returns. The easiest way to beat the market is to buy indices with leverage. Why take the risk of picking individual stocks? If you're right, your performance isn't that much better, and if you're wrong, people will call you an idiot and you will no longer be managing their money. At least if you are in the same trades as everyone else, when you lose money it isn't your fault, you can just blame it on the market. \n\nWhat this means is that professional fund managers are all on the sidelines right now, waiting to buy the dip. You don't want to buy too early, because then you get caught in a bull trap and lose a bunch of money. However, if you buy too late, then your returns don't look as good as someone who bought the same stuff, but a day earlier. So, there is a price where basically FOMO starts to hit. If a short-term squeeze can push the price up far enough, fund inflows will turn a bounce into a bottom. \n\nI think we are still very far from triggering fund re-leveraging. [This data](https://i0.wp.com/heisenbergreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/SPXGammaDeltaFeb232022.jpg) is a few days old, but you can see that gamma doesn't flip positive until SPX 4500, at least. \n\nIf this squeeze continues to pump next week, to the point where gamma flips positive, I think we may see some real buying. Sustained follow-through on this move will be the real tell. Before piling into a long trade I'd want to see SPX break out over 4600. Do I think that's likely to happen? Not really. I have a small long position to ride this squeeze until the wheels fall off, wherever that is. If the market breaks out convincingly above that 4600 level, I'll add more. If the rally stalls out there or at any point before, then the bear market is back on and I'll be loading puts for SPX 3850.", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for the informative response.

{"title": "DWAC to the Future: Thoughts on TruthSocial & TTMG+", "selftext": "**Introduction**\n\nSeveral months ago I was faced with a question: \"Is a Trump-backed internet/social media company worth more than $5B?\" That easily went into my Yes stack. So, I awakened from my slumber, sold GLD, and went in on DWAC at 40, 50, and 60. The stock rose, the stock fell, and with the launch of TruthSocial, it has now risen once more. Given that I am already quite ahead, I decided to take a closer look at a much harder question: Is DWAC/TMTG worth more than $20B? For the reasons set forth below, the answer is yes.\n\n**TMTG Business Structure**\n\nTMTG has two currently announced product lines-- TruthSocial, a Mastadon-based social networking platform and TMTG+ a streaming service. The world is not exactly short on either social networks or streaming providers, but due to the unique market niche these products fill, and other factors, there is good reason to believe they will succeed and produce substantial revenues.\n\n**TruthSocial**\n\nWhen TruthSocial launched I was wait-listed briefly, and then made it in. The content would not surprise anyone-- it is largely anti-Biden and pro-Trump memes, criticisms of liberal politicians, anger/outrage over Covid policies, and then a small subset of QAnon conspiracy bullshit. But while the content was unsurprising, the level of engagement is shocking. The people who are on this platform are really on it. The level of activity is just wild. These guys are extremely enthusiastic (fanatic?) about the product and the community. Currently I have about 1k followers and everything I post gets attention. There is no plague of bots and these are definitely real people. Why is all that relevant from a financial perspective? **ARPU.** \n\nTwitter has an ARPU of about $17. This is going to be many times that just based on activity and zealousness. The demographics also skew towards married family heads / retirees. These are people who have significant expenditures and are big consumers. They also have extreme brand loyalty/support (i.e. the MyPillow guy on Fox). This user base is perfect for monetization. \n\nThere are also significant headwinds from a growth perspective. Trump's twitter had about 89M before it was cancelled. During the coming election season, this will be the one place to go to follow or critique his tweets. Explosive growth is not going to be an issue, it is definitely going to happen, and will be spurred further as news organizations start reporting on Trump's mean truths.\n\nThe very worst case I can imagine for this business would be half a twitter. The reason is not about widespread adoption, but about monetization. Assuming this hits 80M (1/4th a twitter) active users with ARPU of about $60 (I think this is a low number), that's $4.8b revenue right there and easily justifies a market cap of at least $14B. Leaving about $6B to go.\n\n**TMTG+**\n\nThe West is in the middle of a very large culture war. The thing is, only one side of that war has media representation. New shows on Prime, Netflix, Hulu, HBO, Disney+ all basically espouse the same values and are catering to the same ideologies. Nearly every new Netflix show thrusts woke-culture upon its viewers and the others are not much different. \n\nThere is a very large portion of the world that is not onboard with the woke agenda. They are extremely tired of having only the alternative viewpoint represented. Further, all opposing views in entertainment have been met with cancel culture. When is the last time you saw Religion portrayed positively? Where are all the LGBQT villains? \n\nIt is very difficult to make it through any new show without facing a moment of cringe where progressive themes are forced through (Stranger Things S3, Bathroom Scene). Frankly, people are tired of it. But, any alternative viewpoints risk massive consumer and employee angst (see Dave Chapelle). So, only a minimal amount of this content will be endorsed, even if it is overwhelmingly popular. Flatly, the cultural conversation is mostly a monologue when it comes to media.\n\nJust at launch, you can assume that at least half of Trump voters would pick this up, trim that number a bit due to joint households/sharing, and you get about 30M subscribers within the US. Trump is also popular with a subset of Canada, the UK, the EU, and LatAm-- so conservatively, a minimum user-base of 40M sounds about right for a worst case scenario. At $10/m, that will make $6B/yr. And that is worst case. As we enter a political season, engagement is likely to spike. \n\n**Tech Stack**\n\nThey have also announced a tech stack product. That is too speculative to value at this point and given their relationship with Rumble, I will simply leave this value out of the calculation. It presents tremendous upside.\n\n**The Downside Risks**\n\nThere are some downside risks that we should factor in:\n\nA significant amount of shares are currently off the market. Once the merger completes, there will be a lot more shares available. For those looking for a lower risk entry window, that will be the time to get in. However, keep in mind that it is not in anyone's interest to flood the market with TMTG shares, as they would be lowering the value of their own assets, which would take a long time to clear market if they attempted that strategy. This risk may not materialize.\n\nThe platform/growth stalls. Doubtful since Trump has a following and there are at least a few million people who are properly understood as borderline insane. But, there is a risk that the ARPU does not deliver. However, consider that FOX News advertising slots sell at huge multiples of CNN slots, and you'll see whatever user-base is there, they are a huge opportunity.\n\nThe merger is somehow blocked. This would have been possible if Biden was a popular president or if there was stronger democratic control of the SEC. At present, it does not look likely.\n\n**The Headwinds**\n\nWe are heading into an election that will function as free advertising. It will also create \"exclusive\" access to Trump's post, which are popular content with both sides either for support or outrage.\n\nThere is an extremely loyal fan-base, mostly family households, with money, who will put it towards platform advertisers and subscriptions solely due to political beliefs.\n\nThe global \"right-ist\" movement identifies with Trump and so there is geographic reach.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAnnual revenue of at least $10.8b is very achievable. At a multiple of 7 (standard for Streaming platform/social network valuations) That gets us an imputed value of $75.6B. Current purchase price confers about a $16-20B valuation. So, currently it is risk discounted by about 75%. That is a very attractive proposition.\n\nEntering after the merger might be the best opportunity. Short term options are too speculative and I would expect volatility to create losers. Reasonable LEAPS post-merger close also seem like a great play. Alternatively, Rumble is a less risk, less reward play.\n\nAlso, while I am here, for those that ignored me on TTCF-- It is down 50% since I advised getting out. I told you so. It is not going to get better so get out while you can.\n\n**tl;dr** \\- Trump supporters are really easy to monetize and there are a lot of them.

His involvement with this company probably goes as far as putting up the capital and saying some words.\n\n\n4) The algorithm knows that people respond to things that invoke anger, and it seems like a lot of Trump's fans are pretty angry already.

Once the conflict is gone, the boringness will ensue and even the most diehard will eventually forget it exists.\n\nCase and point, I was just banned by the DWAC sub because I posted things that went against their narrative.  Priceless that those who are most likely to throw out the term snowflake are actually the biggest snowflakes themselves.  Took longer than I thought though!\n\nAlso, on TMTG, let’s take Gina Carano as an example.  She was massive and on the verge of having her own show on Disney.  Now she is gone.  Unless TMTG creates an alternative universe of talent where dickhead actors can survive, I don’t see much of a threat to the current leaderboard.  And this “wokeness” nonsense continues to astound.  At some point it will incorporate anything that has an actor who’s an off shade of white.
