Problem is it will expire worthless way more than 50% of the time.  This is what's known as a bad exit strategy and the reason most people lose at it.\n\nThe other option is to let it expire ITM (or just execute it), and depending on how much money you have in your account and what broker you are with, they will execute the option for you and you'll get the stock at your strike price (which will be lower than the current price since the call was ITM).

Anytime you own a contract (buy to open), you decide the fates.. you can execute anytime you want (provided it's not a European style option), even if it's a terrible idea, and you can close it (sell it) anytime you want. The only problem with selling is there has to be a buyer that wants it. This can be another trader like me or you, or it can be a market maker (usually this is a person that just runs a algorithm, or a bot). MMs will only buy your call if they have a reason to. So there's no guarantee you'll ever be able to sell that call back. The other downside is that if you buy a call, you're usually gonna pay either the ask price, or at least close to it.. and when you sell, you'll only get the bid price, or close to it.  Sometimes this bid/ask gap can be wide on options that aren't trading a lot so you'll usually take a loss to the market makers if you are trying to scalp pennies on a trade like that.\n\nIn your example of a stock going from 100 to 50, you definitely wouldn't be able to sell that $1 contract back because there would be no one to buy it, unless you got really lucky and some guys cat jumped on his keyboard and hit the buy button for that particular option at the same time you tried to sell it.. and even then, market makers would probably snatch that up ahead of you.\n\nOh one other thing I forgot.. if you are on a broker like Robinhood that $1 call will only cost you $1. But if you're on Tastyworks or something, it can cost you up to 3 bucks to buy that (or more if it's OTC), and then more to sell.  So keep in mind your broker can have different fees for doing trades.  I have a couple different brokers including Robinhood and I've never seen this mythical \"bad fill\" thing that Robinhood supposedly has. I only trade low priced stocks on RH though so maybe it happens more with higher priced stocks.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "But IF they bought my shitty call for half the stock price, I’d get $0.50 back? Am I understanding that right?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "No, it doesn't go down at the same rate that the stock does. The reason is because the value of the option is based on the likelihood of the price of the stock meeting the strike price when it's OTM (when it's ITM, it has what's called intrinsic value and it can never be lower than that value, or it never should be). So for example, if a 110 call option (OTM and 1 week dte) is worth $.01 when the stock is at 100 dollars, that means almost no one thinks the price of the stock will be at or higher than 110 in a week.  If that stock now goes down to $90 the next day, people tend to think it will keep going in the same direction it was going, which is down. So now 110 is even less likely so people aren't willing to pay $.01 anymore, no one will even think about buying it at that point, and that's from only going down $10.\n\nA good example of how the price changes is to look at how the value of a call option changes when it's ATM (at the money).  I'll use a real world example that actually might be a good trade right now: TREX $100 call Feb 18 for 1.45-2.00.  It's only 16 DTE so I'd probably never do this, but this is just an example. That means if you got it at the midpoint, you'd spend around $175 for that call, and the price of the stock is $95.84 right now.  If it goes up to $100 tomorrow, that call would go up a lot in value because you can see the 95 is at 3.60-4.50 (which is about the difference between the current price and the call option), minus a little bit of time decay since it's would only be 15DTE then. So the option would now be worth about $410 just from the stock going up $5. And every dollar it goes up after that point will add 1$ to the value of the call (which would be $100 gain each time), so it goes up 1 for 1 after it hits the money.  This is why ITM and ATM calls are much better when it goes up.  They are higher risk too though, because they cost more, and whether it's worth that risk or not is very situational.\n\nI just want to reiterate that these plays are generally not good. You're basically gambling that a stock will go in a certain direction and at least a certain amount in a certain amount of time.. which is 3 things working against your bet.  If you can stick with $1 trades, you won't receive a lot of damage but you'll be tempted to go closer to ATM and further out because you'll say things like, \"oh man if I only bought 2 strikes up I would have made xx dollars\".. if you fall to those temptations, you'll start to lose a lot.  If you can keep a level head and realize any gains you get were a crap shoot and you can lose them just as easily, you'll be fine.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you so much for the super detailed explanation.

The typical thing people do though is just sell the call option to someone who wants to do this with it, or someone who thinks it could go higher during the lifetime. In this case there would be $50 of intrinsic value in the call option, meaning you should never sell it for less than $50 (which translates to $5000 when you actually sell it since it's selling for $50 per share and there are 100 shares in a contact).", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "So do I have to buy all the shares in the contract?

So, why would people take huge financial risk to invest in a non-profit, where the best case scenario is at best a return on initial investment and no profit. And let’s not forget about inflation (why we are talking in the first place), which means that you’d get less than your money back. What is the incentive for people to invest? The vast majority of investors are every day people who have invested in a pension fund, do you think these people want to put their money in a non-profit with a high chance of it going to zero?\n\nThen finally you have to understand that it is a lot harder to organize resources and capital efficiently and effectively, and to take financial risk, than it is to take a job as an employee where you have a supportive structure and take much less risk. Back to Elon, do you think he doesn’t do actual work? Do you think the leadership of companies just sit around and get paid? There is a reason those people are so carefully selected and it is because of their skills and work ethic. A lot of them are workaholics and sacrifice other aspects of a personal life for their jobs. That doesn’t necessarily mean that they are great people and the most benevolent, you won’t hear me say that. But it makes sense that those people are rewarded because they have the rarest skill and work ethic. \n\nNow, is the difference in compensation between CEO and employee fair? We agree that it certainly isn’t. In the 50s a CEO made 20x average employee salary, and now it’s beyond 200x. I don’t think that is right and I’m not here to defend it. What I am trying to express is:\n\n1. It isn’t black and white. You can’t just oversimplify because you find it easier and are threatened by the idea of changing your world view. But people live and learn and grow and in the words of Ali “a man who thinks the same at 50 as he did at 20 wasted 30 years of his life”.\n\n2. The system isn’t perfect, but it is better than almost anything there has been (economically it was better in the 50s but technically the same system). And it is a lot easier to make a change that makes the world worse than it is to make a change that makes the world better. Entropy is the natural trend, so we need to be careful what changes we make and we have to be careful to watch for unintended consequences which historically have been hugely important.

They lost money and potential customers by doing that, but they were too racially prejudiced to care.\n\nCapitalism is the private ownership of the means of production. Coops allow workers to own it rather than wealthy executives, it's inherently socialist.

What is it", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "There are several fundamental problems facing PYPL that are scaring investors away.\n\n1) PYPL was already extremely richly valued last year, trading at over 50x 2021 and 2022E EPS. When valuations reach that range, you're priced to perfection. In other words, investors expect that management will deliver excellent earnings, but that sentiment can turn on a knife's edge. This is extremely common with growth stocks; companies that still show room for large percentage growth rates will retain their high multiples because investors have better certainty that management can hit those long term targets. \n\nAny time you see a young, small/mid cap (or even large cap growth) company with a PE >35x, you should assume that investors are implicitly counting on earnings 3-4 years out more than they are current or next year earnings. This is also why tech companies were hammered in January because of Fed rate hike risks; it puts more quantitative and qualitative risk to the likelihood of lofty earnings coming true. And similarly, richly valued companies that show slower long term growth rates will send investors packing. Netflix is a prime example of this.\n\n2) Management floated the possibility of buying Pinterest last fall, which made zero strategic sense. Maybe they thought that they could turn it into an exclusive PayPal-driven marketplace? But PINS has been a money losing stock for years, and PYPL was ready to put up an offensively dumb $40 billion purchase price (funded in no small part by a lot of new PYPL shares!) to get it. \n\nIt took a shareholder revolt to convince management not to buy it (and for good reason. PINS is worth less than half that purchase price today...). Issuing stock for a money-losing business is a terrible prospect as a shareholder. You're going to be both diluted and also rewarded with a money-losing business, so you can't expect any accretion either. It made management and the board look extremely dumb.\n\n3) They're now in the penalty box for reporting bad earnings and guidance. Going into earnings, PYPL was still trading at >35x next year's EPS and about 24x 2023 EPS (per BofA estimates). Now, earnings have been revised far lower than expected, prompting investors to reset their valuation multiples. As an equity investor, you have to pay close attention to the earnings multiple you're buying into before putting in your purchase order. Even though PYPL has dropped significantly from its 2021 highs, it still carried a very rich valuation because earnings were falling alongside the price, meaning that the multiple wasn't compressing down as much as you probably expected. Before last night's release, the Street was estimating about $5.21 Non-GAAP EPS, which put its closing price multiple at ~33.8x ($176). Now, management comes out with a lower EPS guide of $4.68. That commands a higher implied multiple of 37.5x, assuming no change in the stock. At $131, that same multiple is now 28x. \n\nBut after fucking up earnings for two quarters in a row, and lowering both near- and long-term guidance, how trustworthy is that $4.68 estimate? This management team wanted to buy Pinterest at all-time highs and has very clearly misjudged the macro environment and the company's growth prospects (Schulman saying that PYPL focusing on making its existing userbase more engaged, rather than acquiring new users is a great signal of this) - all in the span of 4 months. How do you trust anything that they say? How do any of these actions make you confident that they'll hit their targets? Sure, PayPal as a company is still making a growing cash machine, but what's to keep management from sticking its dick inside the cash machine and fucking up some critical parts? \n\nThat's the major reason why PayPal is tanking today. Investors are souring on the current management team. They haven't demonstrated a clear vision of what PayPal can offer in a post-EBAY world, and until they can prove that they're a permanent post-pandemic player in the very competitive payments arena, their stock will continue to pressure down. Even after earnings expectations have reset and the stock's trading at 28x 2022 EPS, I have little confidence that these estimates are achievable. \n\nIf they say $4.68, I'm going to expect $3.85 - 25% risk factor to account for their bad track record. And if I'm expecting $3.85 and willing to pay 25x earnings for that, then this is worth $96 in my view. Not $131.\n\n^(Edited some wording)", "score": 495, "replies": [{"body": "This is the most intelligent thing I’ve read on one of these stock subs in the last 6 months.", "score": 153, "replies": [{"body": "Hey, now! r/ValueInvesting and r/Investing have their moments.", "score": 23, "replies": [{"body": "thanks drew brees! always figured you were a value investor", "score": 12, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I felt dumb reading this", "score": 9, "replies": []}, {"body": "Every once in a while", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Venmo is the 2nd most used app. Venmo and Amazon to have a deal soon.", "score": 16, "replies": []}, {"body": "Thanks for this very informative write-up", "score": 14, "replies": []}, {"body": "This guy analyzes!!", "score": 25, "replies": [{"body": "And, he's clearly not Drew Brees", "score": 10, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Wouldn't PayPal acquiring pintrest be an easy way to establish themself as a shopping platform?", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "Strategically, yeah, but paying $40 billion means that a Pinterest acquisition would never be accretive to earnings, unless PayPal was earning at least $10 billion in Free Cash Flow every year.

These usually contain a ton of useful information - press releases, SEC filings, company presentations, links to investor calls, sometimes call transcripts, etc. The presentations are great supplements to the SEC filings, all of which you can find on:\n\n2) [The SEC EDGAR database](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html). Type in the company ticker you're looking to research, and the website will return with *all* of that company's SEC filings. By law, public companies must disclose an annual report (Form 10K), quarterly reports (10Q - almost always 3 filed per year), press releases & significant new agreements (Form 8K), and shareholder proxy statements (Form DEF14A). You can also access insider share transactions (Form 4...I usually ignore these because they're like 90% company management selling their stock options to get paid) and large institutional investor positions (Form SC13's). Companies that are about to launch an IPO will file a S-1 filing. This is a total, comprehensive digest of the entire business, its risks, opportunities, and current structure. When the company prices its stock the night before it begins trading, it'll file a 424B3 or 424B5 report - considered the final IPO statement.\n\nI always recommend new investors take their time with 10K's, 10Q's and IPO filings. They are very dense, and contain a lot of boring legalese, but they are the absolute gold standard when it comes to understanding how a company ticks. Before buying a company's stock, you *must* digest the entire 10K first. Start there, and fill in the rest with the other sources.\n\n3) Your brokerage's research reports, if they have any. I like Morningstar, personally, because their reports are written for retail investors and are very easy to digest. Be forewarned that these reports shouldn't be your sole guide. I use them to see a bull/bear case against my own thesis, or if they see a particular detail/angle that I missed. ***Research analysts' price targets are never right***, but their real value-add is in monitoring the industry, keeping abreast of its trends, and offering some read-throughs about what the company is up to. You should use the reports to either supplement or challenge your own investment thesis, not as an oracle to auto-follow.\n\n4) Traditional media outlets - Wall Street Journal, NY Times, Financial Times, The Economist, sometimes CNBC. WSJ is the gold standard for domestic business news. Very deep journalistic bench, very plugged into the industries, and always coming out with insightful stories. I read the WSJ daily. Financial Times is excellent for international markets, and The Economist has great in-depth foreign policy/international economics reporting. Media sources I tend to avoid include YouTube, Twitter, anyone talking about charts/technicals, and anyone saying to buy or sell a particular stock. I do watch CNBC/Bloomberg TV occasionally, but only to take in investors' sentiments about macro trends. I ignore the stocks they hawk and only really focus in on their macro commentary.

Has posted some profits since becoming public,  \nyear 2020 had a gain in cash position. Overall, the company I feel is fairly valued  \nbut down side risk is still present with rising rates. 4/10 most of the pain is  \nover but more isn’t impossible.  \nAdvisorShares Cannabis ETF (MSOS) – Dude weed lamo. But really  \nETF play isn’t bad, weed play is. 6/10 probably will get money back, more  \nlikely not.  \nBeyond Meat (BYND) – Love the concept, fear the financials.  \nAs consumers look towards more environmentally responsible consumption BYND has  \na wonderful product line to satisfy that need. However, I can’t look past the  \nfact they haven’t had a consistently profitable year and the fact that losses are  \naccelerating as quarters go on. I want to believe in this company/stock as I  \ntruly do believe it’s a solid product. 4/10 hope to see financials improve.  \nArk Genomic Revolution ETF (ARKG) – Another ETF play, looks  \nto focus on bonds? Can’t get an honest read on it but its price is still way  \nhigher than it was 3 years ago. ?/10 I think overvalued only because line is  \nhigh.  \nPalantir Technologies (PLTR) – Yeah, this one is toast… Lost  \nnearly 1 billion dollars in 2020 with 3 quarters in 2021 also losing at least  \n100 million dollars a quarter. Along with this halted production due to lack of  \nsales is also very concerning. Still above IPO level… 9/10 pray they get bought  \nout or consumer taste change.  \nPayPal (PYPL) – Last earnings hurt a lot. While prospects due  \nlook gray in the future, it’s PayPal I believe that most recent earnings  \nreaction was way overkill. Large downward movement worthy, but not losing over  \na quarter of the company’s value worthy. 2/10 it’s PayPal, just hold/buy more  \nif able.  \nSquare (SQ) – Largely down due to PYPL, though lack luster profits  \nmake me uneasy. Price to Earnings is 116.0 as of this evening. However, revenue  \nis sharply increasing which is always a good thing. I personally wouldn’t hold  \nthis one, I think growth stocks just had their bubble busted. 5/10 fast revenue  \nis a big plus, all else is largely negatives and shows a lot of downside potential.  \nArk Innovation ETF (ARKK) Oh Cathie, it’s been a rough month.  \nI have a bias here; I hate actively managed funds. While 5-year returns are fantastic  \nit seems that the ETF has poor diversification to offset high volatility in their  \nlineup of stock picks which I see as troubling as market risk appetite wains with  \nthe threat of bonds rates increasing. 7/10 (biased) actively managed funds  \ntypically underperform relative to the general market, I fail to see why ARKK  \nis any different.  \nCorsair Gaming (CRSR) – Profitable with steady revenue  \nincrease. You goofed up on one thing, recent IPO. 3/10 IPO looks to be the main  \nthing messing this one up, profits are also lagging but really overall solid  \nfundamentals.  \nArk Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF) – Another actively managed  \nfund… Fintech has taken a brutal beating which has caused this section of ETFs  \nto suffer. Fintech is new to the market so as easily as this has come down it could  \neasily shoot back up; I remain optimistic for its future. 4/10 Let’s hope Robinhood  \nisn’t the largest holding for this fund.  \niShares Global Clean Energy (ICLN) – war has hindered this  \none. As oil/natural gas price climb fossil fuel companies have more attractive  \nreturns taking away funds from this fund. However, rising prices are a double edge  \nsword. As prices rise so does general energy prices, increasing the demand for  \nother energy sources to supply.  2/10 passive  \nETF plays are they way to go, clean energy will also make a come back in the coming  \nyears.  \nDisney (DIS) – It’s Disney, it’ll take a while to recover  \nbut it will happen. 1/10 time in the market beats timing the market.  \nSofi Technologies (SOFI) – Bank charter looks promising.  \nWhat doesn’t however, is Joe Biden's debt relief program. A lot of SOFI’s  \nrevenue currently comes from student interest debt which the president has been  \nforgiving. I’d like to bring back to attention the bank charter.

The appeal of MMOs happens to be exactly why so many people avoid them; it's not for everyone. It never has been or will be.\n\nWhich is why, if you bothered to read what I wrote, Meta will take elements of what worked in MMO's and apply it to normal applications in its metaverse. \n\n>You claim it's revolutionary and not entering a saturated market, but also claim that there's at least two companies working on developing direct competition; i.e. entering a saturated market.\n\nMicrosoft and Apple have either not released a proper VR headset equivalent to Quest or are still developing it, that's not a saturated market. \n\n>You seem to think that being like consoles, MMOs and gaming marketplaces means all of those audiences, but that's not how people work. The subsection of each of those groups who uses all of those things is the audience susceptible to using the meta verse; i.e. you're not adding the fractions you're multiplying them.\n\nWrong, the world Zuck's building is an environment where eventually all those niches can be filled in different parts of its metaverse infrastructure. \n\n>That's why Eve Online, which appeals to so many different people is actually played by so few, and the meta verse is the same.\n\nNo it won't. \n\n>Facebook is paying to market to a billion people with a product that only a few thousand would actually dedicate time and money to.\n\nYou're basing that on no exponential development of its VR/digital products over a 10 year timeline.\n\n>This is an MMO with a AAA advertising budget and billion dollar development plan, the uphill battle to reach profitablity here is insanely steep.\n\nGood thing it's not then. \n\n>Most MMOs fail and go bankrupt right out of the gate because they can't get a big enough active and concurrent user base, and Facebook is spending a ton more of development of this than most MMOs, so that's an even steeper uphill battle.\n\nMeta develops infrastructure for the metaverse and can licence that hardware/software to developers of thirdparty software or hardware. \n\n>Stop deluding yourself into believing this idea isn't a wildly risky and ill-conceived endeavor.\n\nI understand you hate Facebook and Zuck which is fine, but to write off this conception of the Metaverse is foolish.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "This has nothing to do with opinions about Zuck, this about understanding markets, speculation and hot air.

Biden Can't Bring Himself to Say It — and Musk Has Noticed\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-02-02/tesla-who-biden-can-t-bring-himself-to-say-name-angering-musk](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-02-02/tesla-who-biden-can-t-bring-himself-to-say-name-angering-musk)\n\nFull article:\n\nBy Dana Hull and Jennifer Jacobs\r  \n\r  \nPresident Joe Biden calls himself a union guy and a car guy, and he’s embraced electric vehicles as vital to his economic and climate ambitions.\r  \n\r  \nBut there’s one U.S. car company he won’t talk about: Tesla Inc., the world’s most valuable automaker and the global brand most clearly associated with EVs. \r  \n\r  \n“I meant it when I said the future was going to be made right here in America,” Biden said in a tweeted video with General Motors Co. chair and Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra on Thursday. “Companies like GM and Ford are building more electric vehicles here at home than ever before.”\r  \n\r  \nThe tweet didn’t go unobserved by avid Twitter user and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. “Starts with a T. Ends with an A. ESL in the middle,” he replied.\r  \n\r  \nAt every opportunity, Biden hails progress Ford and GM have made toward fielding an electric fleet. But his ongoing and obvious snubs of Tesla -- a source of mild intrigue within the administration -- have sparked increasingly exasperated public reactions from Musk, the world’s wealthiest person and the CEO of both Tesla and SpaceX, which has government contracts with NASA and the U.S. military. \r  \n\r  \nMusk tweeted after the White House event Thursday with Barra and Ford CEO Jim Farley, to which Tesla was not invited, that “Biden is treating the American public like fools.” He added that the president is “a damp sock puppet in human form.” Over the weekend, he egged on fans who started an online petition asking the president to “acknowledge Tesla’s leadership in regards to electric vehicles.” \r  \n\r  \nIn 2021, Tesla delivered over 936,000 cars globally. GM sold nearly 480,000 EVs last year, mostly in China. In the U.S., the company had to recall its electric Chevrolet Bolt because of risk of battery fires and sold just 26 EVs in the fourth quarter -- 25 Bolts and one electric GMC Hummer pickup truck.\r  \n\r  \nUAW Support\r  \nThere’s no real mystery behind Biden’s antipathy toward Tesla, according to a person familiar with the president’s thinking. The president has long enjoyed the support of unions in his political campaigns, including the United Auto Workers, and while Tesla employees enjoy generous pay and benefits including equity in the car maker, Musk is hostile toward unions and company workers aren’t organized.\r  \n\r  \n“Fighting for their right to steal money from workers!” Musk tweeted Nov. 10 in reply to news about an ongoing federal corruption investigation of UAW officials.\r  \n\r  \nWithin Tesla, there is a feeling among some executives that all of this is just politics: Biden will never win Texas, where Musk now lives, while Michigan -- home to Ford and GM -- and UAW support is key to Democratic victories both in upcoming midterm elections and in 2024.\r  \n\r  \nEven some Biden aides say they wish the boss would warm to Musk’s company. “Bums me out as a satisfied Tesla owner,” one said. The White House officials who spoke for this story all asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue.\r  \n\r  \nLast fall, after a White House event promoting electric vehicles that excluded Tesla, Musk said Biden is “biased” against the company and said his administration “seems to be controlled by unions.” \r  \n\r  \nMusk has also belittled a key Biden policy: the president’s proposal to reinstate a $7,500-per-car tax credit for EVs and eliminate a cap on the number of vehicles from any one manufacturer that are eligible for the credit. Tesla hit the limit on the original EV tax credit in 2018. \r  \n\r  \n‘Can This Whole Bill’\r  \nBiden’s proposal, though, comes with an anti-Tesla twist: consumers would be eligible for an extra $4,500 if they buy an EV assembled by union workers. \r  \n\r  \n“Honestly, I would just can this whole bill,” Musk said of Biden’s “Build Back Better” legislation in December, shortly before Senator Joe Manchin, a key West Virginia centrist, killed the measure by withdrawing his support. \r  \n\r  \n“Tesla has done extraordinary things for electric vehicles and that’s a big part of why the whole industry now knows EVs are the future,” White House spokeswoman Emilie Simons said in a statement to Bloomberg News.\r  \n\r  \nShe noted that Tesla has “benefited greatly” from EV tax credits in the past. “But, unfortunately, their CEO has suggested an opposition to new EV tax credits,” she said, without using Musk’s name.\r  \n\r  \nSimons said the Thursday event at the White House was for business leaders who support Build Back Better. GM’s Barra recently became chair of the Business Roundtable, a lobby group in Washington that, like Musk, opposes Build Back Better. But Barra has said she personally supports the measure.\r  \n\r  \nMusk didn’t respond to an email requesting comment for this story.\r  \n\r  \nTesla, founded in 2003, makes fully electric cars at its factories in California and Shanghai. The company moved its corporate headquarters last year from Palo Alto, California, to Austin, Texas, where it has completed a new factory that’s larger than the Pentagon.\r  \n\r  \nTesla has about 10,000 workers at its factory in Fremont, California. The UAW, headquartered in Detroit, has made various attempts to organize workers there with little success. \r  \n\r  \nOther purely electric vehicle companies, including Lucid Group Inc. and Amazon-backed Rivian Automotive Inc. are also non-union -- and Biden hasn’t said anything about them, either, according to a search of his public remarks at Factba.se. Like Tesla workers, employees at Lucid and Rivian also enjoy stock options as part of their compensation packages.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": ">Even some Biden aides say they wish the boss would warm to Musk’s company. “Bums me out as a satisfied Tesla owner,” one said.

Problem is, he's been the target of three decades of organized and disorganized hate and disinformation campaigns.\n\nSome had slightly valid roots.  He was notoriously mean to employees during his epic hedge fund run.  But that was co-opted by rich enemies when his fund was beasting the market with 24-27% returns at a time when their 10-12% had been considered \"good\".  After making generational wealth and degrading his own health, Cramer literally recognized himself as a villain, and made a conscious mid-life decision to stop and recast himself entirely.  He wrote columns calling himself a villain of Wall Street, and a seminal book in which he confessed to being a \"Street\" addict.\n\nAfter about 15 years of utter dominance, his ego took him into trying to become a billionaire journalist-mogul.  Timing, plus those enemies, slaughtered his ambitions.  His startup gave him staggering paper wealth, while his actual hard assets got drained.  The stock went from $80 to 80 cents in the dot com crash.  Surprisingly, it was one of the few to actually survive that bomb out.  It recovered in more modest form and he actually kept it going until last year.\n\nThat brutal lesson forged him.  He left the industry and committed to be a self-styled educator and exposer of the corrupt but legal practices of Wall Street.  He protected millions for himself so that he would never have to actually work for rent again and pivoted to books, news, blogs, radio, and tv.  It was a reversion to who he was growing up.   \n\nTurns out that aggressively exposing the attitude and slimy practices of billionaires gets you some powerful enemies who aren't constrained by silly things like truth in how they fight.  He was the first and only media figure to name and shame individual CEOs and lambaste them all day, every day.  He ran a \"wall of shame\" and ranked the daily highlight who was the worst of the worst.  That set up another decade of organized disinformation.\n\nThe next army of hate and deceit was conscripted by an infamously deceptive saga with The Daily Show.  That brought in another army of well meaning but badly bamboozled amateur haters.\n\nNow under attack by multiple well-funded armies, by the mid 2010's, a political and conspiracy-driven cohort joined in.  Then his accurate assessment of Elon Musk's psychopathy and securities fraud added an even bigger faction of haters.  \n\nFast forward to the video game retailer events of a year ago.  He congratulated the acolytes on busting the shorts and begged them to cash out at $400, which has turned out to have been a spectacularly good call.  No matter, they misperceived that as an act of war, and added their numbers to existing armies.\n\nNext up came the Reddit bro's.  And the fans of the defeated politician trying to violently overthrow our democracy.  \n\nAnd just when you thought there were any more large bands of easily brainwashed zombies that could be programmed to go after him... he dared to state the scientifically and economically correct point that our economy can't recover until we defeat the pandemic.  Cue that anti-reality mob.  \n\nHe's besieged by mostly bad and/or brainwashed people from all over.  There's little chance of fact or objectivity to be seen through all the tear gas they throw.  \n\nAnd particular to this sub, it's cruelly ironic.  Cramer is the one and only Wall Street personality who has *ever* had any respect or offered any comfort to small time, individual retail investors... the so-called home gamers.  The people here who waste their energy spreading disinformation.  \n\nHe's the one who made what happens here possible, and believed there could be a path around institutional smugness and false control.  He's the one who explained that it's not actually that hard, and that a committed and disciplined student can manage their own money and can create wealth for themselves.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "That was an interesting \"History of Cramer\" lesson", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I didn't really emphasize that narcissism has been a consistent driver in everything he's done and still does.

He breezed through academics and had his pick of careers, but always wanted to be some kind of truth teller, a journalist, a documentarian, something like that.\n\nHis law degree and talent for rhetoric would have made him a rich lawyer. But he leaned more to low paid pursuits like reporting.  He had his pick of jobs and he chose the top job at the top financial firm in the world at the time.  And he excelled there.  So much so that when he set off on his own, wealthy clients followed.  \n\nHe rightly attributes a lot of success to others, especially Karen Cramer.  She was adept where he was weakest: self awareness and technical objectivity.  Since splitting with her, he had to adopt certain tools as crutches for what she provided and which he lacks.  To this day, he still relies on others for technicals which he can't comprehend himself.  And a large portion of his market sentiment (manifested as the \"picks\" that critics are obsessed about) are cheated from technical RSI charts that he, to this day, purchases in antiquated paper form and pores over weekly.  \n\nAt the hedge fund, his inherent insecurity and uncontrollable narcissism drove him to work harder and longer and more ruthlessly every day.  When you end up succeeding at everything you try, it's understandable how the narcissism can be reinforced, and his the insecurity tells that enough is never enough.\n\nToday I think he sees himself as the only pundit who puts individual retail investors first.

{"title": "AMD Yolo Update - <24 hrs after position was opened.", "selftext": "Hi everyone. Been several requests for an update to the call options. This will be the last update until I exit my position. To answer the question: It's up ~$240k usd since open & at the time of the screenshot (<24 hrs). I have no intention of selling today - I bought jan 2023 calls (leaps) because I believe that AMD is going to continue climbing. I will 💎 👐 this for a while.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFAQ: \n\nWhy only 240k? I thought calls meant 🚀🚀🚀. 100%+\n \n- These are leaps. They expire in a *LONG* time & I bought the day before ER, so the premiums were expensive. The gains are not near as large as shorter dated options. Leaps behave a bit differently than short term options. I personally treat these as the same thing as running ~4-6x leverage long on AMD - with the benefit that I cannot get liquidated if the price moves against me.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIV crush?\n \n- Leaps are not as susceptible to IV crush as shorter dated options. This is partially because we will see 3 more ER's before these options expire, leading to very similar market conditions that we just experienced. IV will be high before all those ER's too. This lets me continue to hold them, without worrying too much about decay. I tentatively plan to exit before next ER, market conditions pending.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAre you selling today? Lock in gains?\n \n- No lol. I'm holding for at least 1-3 months. Let the winners ride. My thesis has not changed. I will post an update to WSB's when I exit, but none before then (for my AMD position). I suspect we will see AMD continue to climb, and I hold my targets of $140-160 within 3 months.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThesis?\n\n- It's really not that complicated. The company's still growing like crazy. I have been following AMD for some time, and based off rumors that I was reading into I suspected that they would crush ER again. They overdelivered. AMD's been in a non stop bull run for the last few years to match the company growth. Why would it stop here? It just dipped & (in my views) the market overreacted. It was the perfect opportunity for any bull to buy (Cramer was... RIGHT?!?). I view AMD like I view Tesla. Don't bet against Lisa. Don't bet against Elon. You won't win. I don't believe that $160 was the top, but rather a side effect of macro conditions (everything dumped) combined with people taking massive gains (it hit $160 fairly quickly). $100 was the bottom - it hit it *very* quickly and lots of paper hands got worried and sold. I don't believe the macro market will continue dipping (We have already bottomed for the next ~3 months) which gives me a few months of room to grow these leaps. I may reconsider when interest rates start going up.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhy leaps? Why not shares?\n\n- Leaps give me cheap access to leverage, which is what I am using them for with my AMD investment. If it hits ~$160 within the next quarter, shares would net me ~50% returns, whereas leaps will be ~300%+.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf you think it's going to hit $160 within the next quarter, why not buy options with a closer expiry?\n\n- Leaps are a bit of a hedge. It's true that they don't gain value as quickly as shorter dated options. However - *IF I AM WRONG* and the share price plummets, I can keep holding. I am often wrong in the short term. I believe in my thesis, and that they will hit ATH's by EOY. My targets are sooner, but sometimes the markets disagree. Leaps let me have the option for either to occur. I am long term bullish on AMD, and would be okay if they dipped 5-10-20%. I'd just keep holding. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhat do you do for work? How did you get this money?\n\n- I am a software engineer. However, the majority of my money has been made via my own high risk investing. My investment style is not suitable for most people. My primary investments are into leaps as I like the leverage they offer.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nNext play?!\n\n- Nothing right now. I'm just going to sit on my current portfolio for a bit. Likely just wait for a good exit on AMD.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[EDIT]\n\nI closed the position: \n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/snzefu/sold_amd_bought_intel_how_retarded_am_i/\n\n&nbsp;\n\nPosition update: https://imgur.com/a/sU7LT06", "id": "sisjsp", "created_utc": 1643818526.0, "score": 134, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 100, "comments": [{"body": "I am following this mofo.

People OP sold those calls to are gambling not only on volatility staying high, but staying high bc the price moves in the right direction. \n\nYou're not just factoring change of the underlying share price, but *rate of change*. Think back to math and physics, velocity is the derivative of position over time. Hence why options are known as derivatives.\n\nIf Google price had slowly and steadily climbed to 3k over months or years, the rate of change would be low, and Implied Volatility and therefore options premiums would reflect that. \n\nBut Google hits 3k by jumping 10% in a single day? That means there's a higher likelihood of a further large move in either direction equally quickly.\n\nHow does one take advantage of this? Right now, both calls AND puts are expensive because of high IV triggered by the stock split news.. They are likely to drop in price soon due to volatility falling back down, since GOOG is typically not a volatile stock with massive daily swings, unlike say TSLA. \n\nSo, rather than buying options, I'd recommend *selling* options on GOOG today, with the expectation that the share price won't change too drastically after today, IV will drop, the options you sold would become cheaper and you can buy them back for less down the road. \n\nFor example, you could sell both a single call and a put for Google at $3000 expiring Feb 18, and get paid a total of ~$14.6k for both. If by Feb 18 GOOG s under 2850 or over 3150, you'll end up losing money.

He was a driven salesperson, convincing other companies to bundle SoftKey’s products with their own and later licensing software from other firms, which proved more cost-effective than internal development. O’Leary also had an appetite for acquisitions, and snapped up many other software firms. By 1995, the company had taken the name of one of its acquisitions, The Learning Company (TLC), and relocated to Boston. By then, it was focused on educational software for kids. In 1998, toy company Mattel made a US$3.8 billion offer for TLC.\n\n>The purchase was disastrous for Mattel. In the third quarter of 1999, management projected a $50-million profit for its TLC division. Instead, management revised forecasts to project a loss of between $50 million and $100 million, sending Mattel’s stock crashing and wiping out billions in shareholder value. O’Leary was pushed out of the company six months after the deal closed.\n\n>Shareholders filed a class action lawsuit against Mattel, alleging TLC used accounting tricks to hide losses and inflate quarterly revenue. The defendants, including O’Leary, denied the claims. Mattel settled in 2003 for $122-million.\n\nThat was just his first shitty money losing business, who knew you could bankrupt your way to the top… ahh capitalism…\n\n[https://archive.canadianbusiness.com/blogs-and-comment/kevin-oleary-conservative-leadership-bid-business-record/](https://archive.canadianbusiness.com/blogs-and-comment/kevin-oleary-conservative-leadership-bid-business-record/)", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "that is scary, but proves to the world that success is not measured by how good something is but how it is presented.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Yup, basically the Trump, fake business man, from Canada.

O’Leary’s role was primarily about marketing (he didn’t have a licence to manage money), and his name recognition helped bring in clients. The vision was his, however, and he wanted to offer products to retirees and Baby Boomers in search of yield after the federal government’s crackdown on income trusts. Further, his co-hosting duties on The Lang and O’Leary Exchange gave him access to CEOs, politicians and fund managers, helping to generate broad investment ideas, he told Canadian Business.\n\n>The notion that some of the world’s top financial minds are spilling secrets to O’Leary in the dressing room is one that has garnered skepticism, notably from Mark McQueen, who operates venture debt company Wellington Financial in Toronto. He is a prolific blogger, and O’Leary is one of his favourite targets. “Kevin O’Leary is a fantastic television personality,” he says. “I’m not sure what that has to do with picking stocks.” McQueen created a mock portfolio on his blog of 15 dividend-paying stocks to compete with the first fund, [O’Leary Global Equity Income Fund], when it launched. As of early April, McQueen’s basket of stocks was up 16.7%. OGE units were down 11.4%.\n\n>O’Leary said that year the company had more than $1.5 billion under management. By 2015, the figure had dropped to $800-million. (In this, the company is not alone; many fund managers have been hurting in recent years.) Canoe Financial, a company chaired by fellow Dragons’ Den alum Brett Wilson and possessing roughly $3 billion under management at the time, announced a deal to acquire the investment assets of O’Leary Funds in October 2015.\n\n>O’Leary hasn’t left the investment business entirely. He and O’Brien now operate O’Shares Investments, which provides a small suite of ETFs.\n\nLol, you literally could have been a money and thrown a dart at any dividend payer and over the last 13 years made triple your money at least… this guy was losing money… lol.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "He also gambled his money away in his 20s.
