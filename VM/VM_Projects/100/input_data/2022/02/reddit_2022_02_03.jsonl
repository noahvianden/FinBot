{"title": "Facebook's disastrous results are bad news for Snap and other companies that risk losing billions of dollars from Apple's privacy changes", "selftext": "Facebook's disastrous results on Wednesday show how a privacy crackdown by Apple last year is having a longer and larger impact on the digital \nadvertising industry\n, with billions of dollars due to be lost this year alone. Snap, Twitter and Pinterest may be next in line for a hammering. \n\nApple's iOS 14.5 update in April let users opt out of tracking by apps and disrupted how many tech companies target and measure ads. \n\nDavid Wehner, Facebook's CFO, said on Wednesday that the company expects to lose $10 billion in 2021 due to the ongoing impact of these changes. This is more than the expected financial impact Apple's moves had last year on Facebook, Snap, and Twitter combined. \n\n\"It's a pretty significant headwind on our business,\" Wehner said. Facebook's stock plunged 23% in late trading after the results, which included a big miss on revenue from its metaverse segment, Reality Labs.\n\nInvestors are now bracing for similar financial carnage at rivals such as Snap, Twitter and Pinterest. Shares of those 3 companies dropped 17%, 8%, and 9%, respectively in after-hours trading on Wednesday. \n\nSnap took a big hit last year, saying in its third-quarter results that Apple's alternative ad tools did not work as well as anticipated. The company missed revenue guidance and its stock has steadily fallen in recent months. Like Facebook, before the new privacy controls rolled out, Snap had said it would be able to avoid a serious financial hit. Snap reports fourth-quarter results Feb. 3.\n\nLast year, Twitter CFO Ned Segal said the company saw a \"modest\" impact from the Apple changes in the third quarter, noting it was \"lower than expected.\" Twitter reports next on Feb. 10. \n\nPinterest has said it expects \"varying degrees of impact for advertisers on audiences, measurement and reporting, and conversion campaigns.\" Pinterest's earnings report is due Feb. 3.\n\nDuring a conference call with analysts on Wednesday, Facebook's Wehner took aim at Apple for its deal with Google to have that search engine be the default on its devices. The executive suggested this arrangement creates an \"incentive\" for the iPhone maker to treat Google better than Facebook and other digital \nad companies\n. The impending launch of iOS 15 will create even more of an impact, he added, along with new data privacy regulations in Europe.\n\n\"There's a clear trend where less data is available for personalized ads,\" Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's founder and CEO, said on the call. \"We're rebuilding a lot of our advertising infrastructure so we can continue to grow and deliver personalized ads.\"\n\nSuch rebuilding will take time. COO Sheryl Sandberg said the business impact will \"moderately\" increase in the first quarter of 2022, and then continue through the year. The company is still receiving \"less granular\" conversion data, or information about what ads result in a user making a purchase or taking another action. And it's coming on a \"delayed basis,\" she said. Measurement of ad targeting and reach is still taking a big hit. \n\n\"It's very much a multi-year effort to rebuild our ad targeting,\" Sandberg said.\n\nIt's a different tone than the company took for much of last year. Facebook previously said it was working to \"mitigate\" any impact. Sandberg said in July it was \"on us to keep making the case that personalized advertising is good for people and businesses.\" Wehner mentioned the use of Facebook's own Aggregated Events Management for ad targeting, saying the goal was to \"even improve performance with less data.\"", "id": "sj93o8", "created_utc": 1643860297.0, "score": 405, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 173, "comments": [{"body": "Imagine if Google also Implements Apples default data restrictions for Android, the social media stocks will burn hot red!", "score": 73, "replies": [{"body": "I don't think it'll happen because Android doesn't rely on cookies, but this is a good eye opener. \n\nInvesting in a social media platform is just a weird concept to me.", "score": 22, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "I have no response, because i don't know. \nI simply believe that google uses your searches to gather information, whereas facebook uses cookies, which are becoming more protected.

{"title": "Why FB is investing so heavily into VR (if it isn't obvious by now)", "selftext": "They have no control over the OS right now. iOS (Apple) and Android (Google) can do whatever they want at the OS level.\n\nWithout control at the OS level. FB can't do the following:\n\n* Create an app store and charge 30% for transactions like Apple and Google does\n* Control its own destiny. Right now, Apple and Google control FB's destiny just as much as FB itself does. Ex: Apple deciding to take away app tracking. Android could do it eventually as well because Google now knows less tracking drives more advertisers to Google search.\n* Market its own products and services over Apple and Google's. For example, Youtube is preinstalled on Android and Apple's app store ads compete with FB's.\n\nFB is hellbent on having its own OS and controlling its own destiny in what they think is the next mass-market device: VR.\n\nFB is early in the VR push. It's early because it wants a seat at the table when VR is mature. But being early is expensive and they're not guaranteed to beat Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, or some Chinese/unknown company.\n\nThat's why FB is willing to lose $10b/year on VR. Do I think it's the right strategic decision? I don't know. Am I surprised that they're willing to lose $10b/year on VR? Not at all. Not one bit. I think Zuckerberg, with his full control, would drive Meta to bankruptcy before giving up on it.\n\n**Additional commentary:**\n\nWhile I think Zuckerberg truly believes in the \"metaverse\" future, I think the recent push into VR is somewhat fueled by the inability to innovate inside FB. Think about it. When was the last time FB launched a hit app? Whatsapp and Instagram were purchased. The best IG features were copied from Snap (Stories) and Tiktok (Reels). Besides the traditional social media apps, people are also spending more time on other networks like Reddit, Discord, Twitch, Clubhouse. FB can't innovate.\n\nThey've built a culture of optimization, not creation. Because of this, they can't make something to capture the attention of the younger generation. As we all know, each generation has its own set of social media apps because kids don't want to use the same social network as their parents. FB will eventually die out because of this lack of innovation. The \"metaverse\" is kind of like Zuckerberg's hail mary. If he can create a platform, he can be the Apple or Google by controlling the OS. He won't have to worry about a new cool app that steals users away from FB/IG/Whatsapp because that app will be on his own platform.\n\nLet me ask you this: if TikTok was invented by Facebook, would they still go all in on the meta verse right now?\n\nDisclaimer: I don't own any FB stocks. I actually dislike the company a lot and wouldn't buy their stocks out of principle.

When it comes to XR, I predict a lot of the metaverse will run on WebGL technology not game engines such as Unity and Unreal (they may compile to WebAssembly but the metaverse will live on open platforms).

I dumped them in November after I decided to dump all of my tech and growth stocks completely.\n\nFew points.\n\n(1) No one was talking about FB on this subreddit before because they weren't a topic before.  No one is currently talking about Suncor and the oil and gas industry (which is booming super high), but it would become a topic if they crashed tomorrow.  A company has to become a centerpiece of discussion in order to really have that kind of a discussion on a place like this that largely focuses on popular content and flavors of the day.\n\n(2) Facebook VR and AR has always been very divisive among investors.  Early allegations of digital \"groping\" really hurt them.  People have different visions of what VR should be used for.  Digital sex... is going to be a thing regardless of Facebook decides to support it or not.  If they're really going to be creating their own ecosystem what people want is something like Reddit that is largely unsanitized, but is moderated.  If I want to treat a person like a total piece of shit it's totally fine at /r/RoastMe.  If I want to see nudie ladies there's a place for that.  If I want to share my interest in gardening, there's a place for that.  But it's all moderated experiences to gatekeep people from experiences they don't want to have.  And I think, that's a challenge for Facebook VR and problems they're having.  If they're too moderated they'll have low adoption.  If they're under moderated you're going to have situations where children will get digitally groped.\n\n(3) Facebook's value stayed high because it's user count and activity has stayed stable.  This is the first time that Facebook's user count has gone down.  That has some pretty dire consequences long term.  This has also created division (and thus discussion) on Facebook's future.  People who are holding are convinced that having a unique Meta ecosystem will mean Facebook can hold more of its revenues and won't need as many users to thrive.  They also think that Meta will overall attract more users who will spend a larger share of their revenue towards this group of companies.  On the other side, investors who maybe joined the sell off (or have held and want the direction of the company to change) don't see a future for Meta and Facebook's own ecosystem and instead feel like there's a leadership problem.\n\n(4) It's pretty rare for top voted comments on this subreddit to be like \"I was totally wrong\" or to have one that has a great amount of insight into a stock.  Typically redditors are buying stocks based on trends and then getting burned by not selling quick enough.  I have pulled almost 70% of my (previously invested) money out of the market.

Generally I find I need to buy in bulk for it to work out as well as my local supermarket for items less than £10. Things like kitchen sponges I buy in a box of like 100 which works out about the same as what we'd pay in a supermarket without the hassle of actually having to go to a supermarket.\n\nI'll also add their customer service is great. There has been a couple of times in the past where I've returned unboxed electronics because I've brought the wrong thing and they've asked absolutely no questions, given me a full refund as well as coming to collect the return from my door for free.

Here are the results.\n\nEarnings per share: $27.75\nRevenue: $137.4 billion vs $137.6 billion expected, according to a Refinitiv survey of analysts\nAWS revenue: $17.37 billion expected, according to StreetAccount\nIt is not immediately clear if the reported earnings per share are comparable to analyst estimates.\n\nAmazon is wrapping up a rollercoaster earnings season for mega-cap tech companies. Netflix shares were hammered late last month after a weak subscriber outlook spooked investors. Upbeat earnings from Apple, Microsoft and Google parent Alphabet in recent days suggested the season could end on a high note, but then Facebook revealed stagnating user growth, which sent its shares plunging and dragged down other social media stocks.\n\nAmong the top tech companies, Amazon was the worst performer last year, with the stock rising just 2.4%. It’s down 16% so far in 2022, as investors rotate out of the sector on concerns about inflation and rising interest rates.\n\nAnalysts expect Amazon to record year-over-year revenue growth of just under 10% for the fourth quarter, which includes the peak holiday shopping season. That would be the first period of single-digit growth since the third quarter of 2017.\n\nProfit is projected to plunge to $3.68 per share from $14.09 per share a year ago. In recent quarters, earnings have cratered and sales growth has decelerated as the company navigates a slowdown in the pandemic-driven e-commerce bump, global supply chain constraints and labor shortages.\n\nAmazon has been ploughing profits into physical expansion, with Jefferies analysts estimating the company opened 350 new facilities in 2021. It also hiked wages to an average of $18 an hour to lure workers and has increased incentives, offering signing bonuses worth as much as $3,000 in certain markets.\n\nIn some cases, the labor shortage forced Amazon to reroute packages over longer and costlier distances to facilities with enough staff to handle them.\n\nCEO Andy Jassy, who succeeded Jeff Bezos at the helm last year, previously warned that Amazon would take on “several billion dollars” of extra costs in the fourth period because of the headwinds. Amazon said its operating profit could be as little as zero.\n\nWall Street will be paying particularly close attention to Amazon’s first-quarter guidance, as investors try to model how much additional pressure the company expects from inflation and supply shortages.\n\nWhile its core retail business faces clear challenges, Amazon is leaning on other divisions, including its profitable cloud-computing unit and fast-growing advertising division. Analysts expect Amazon Web Services to post revenue growth of 36% from a year ago.\n\n“Amazon’s growth, similar to most other e-commerce companies, decelerated all through FY21, and the market is concerned about that continuing into Q1, maybe Q2, with uncertainty on where growth rates normalize beyond that,” Guggenheim analysts wrote in a note to clients late last month. “Q1 guidance will be in focus this week, and the bar seems quite low, but more important will be any hints as to where sales and margins can go from there.”", "id": "sjudiz", "created_utc": 1643922438.0, "score": 169, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 120, "comments": [{"body": "Went up 15% or 450ish a share in 5 minutes after close.", "score": 87, "replies": [{"body": "Was priced by funds to have WORSE earnings than it did.

The algo pushes such random things but it knows what I might like and interact with, without pushing a full feedback loop. So discovery of whatever is very much alive and people love that. Content creators with no followers can get the spotlight because of the engagement they get on the one post, but won’t get a boost otherwise based on past performance. It’s a new roll, and reset more than not, so engagement behavior must be demonstrated again and again, pushing people to new ideas and techniques. Thus drive a very creative process to capture peoples eyeballs.\n\nThis is innovative, and honestly a BIG THREAT to $FB.

If you agree with Tony Seba's RethinkX report on agriculture, then it'll be an extremely sharp S curve as traditional animal farming goes bankrupt and is almost entirely replaced by fake meat.\n\nIt's looking more and more that - also similar to Tesla - they are going to take a larger chunk than people initially realised.\n\nBeyond do patent their IP AFAIK.\n\nGross margins for BYND are \\~30%.

Because the goal is to make this be what meat is today, if there are no advantages to the product (since they try to replicate meat succeeding 100% to taste like meat would be on par) then fake meat will be what meat is today, and you can apply similar margins. These companies trade at like 0.8x sales, so $70B revenue would translate to $54B market cap. Now there is some growth remaining there, so maybe that goes to $80B or something like that in 2030. \n\nAt current valuation of $3.75B that seems like a pretty good risk/reward but they need to grow the revenue base from about $500M to $70B in 9 years, I am not sure how much capital they have and how much dilution or debt they'd need to take on.

Took it to service for alignment, then had the steering wheel centered, and finally after digging online I think I found the issue - there is no steering returnability.  Meaning if I turn the wheel left or right the car will continue to drift that way until I correct.  This makes driving on the freeway particularly exhausting because you're constantly having to course correct because the car isn't doing it naturally.  This is an issue with other vehicles as well if the steering mechanism has a bolt too tight, for example.\n\nSo yesterday the lead mechanic at Tesla Service sat with me as I showed him and he drove the car as well.  He said the car drives normal, and that when I accelerate it makes the car go straight again.  That is absolutely not true.  Frankly, I think he had no idea what he was talking about and just wanted me to leave.  I have a M3 as well, so I know how the steering should feel.\n\nLong story short, should I take my MY to a third party mechanic?

He also said Teslas have internal computer diagnostics which would show if the steering was off.\n\nIf they don't even think there's a problem or keep thinking its something else it's kind of hard to feel like they're going to figure it out.\n\nMaybe I need to try a few other service centers instead of the Torrance one.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "dang man, I'm sorry to hear that..

Went in a second time to service to have them center the steering wheel which I had read on forums was an issue.  They centered the steering wheel.

You can find the release [here](https://ir.system1.com/news/news-details/2021/System1-Reports-Preliminary-Third-Quarter-2021-Results/default.aspx). \n\nTo give a summation on guidance, they **increased revenue guidance for the full year 3.5%**. They **increased adjusted EBITDA for the full year by 1.8%**. Their **net income YTD is 45M**, and 21M in the third quarter alone which represents an almost 100% increase in net income increase. They also released an analyst presentation.\n\nFor some highlights:\n\n* Revenue was up 47%\n* Gross profit was up 72%\n* The company will maintain the rule of 40 which means top line or bottom-line growth YoY combined exceeds 40%, and will do so for the foreseeable future.\n* Advertising revenue through Owned and operated properties as well as affiliates, and AV subscription revenue\n* International Expansion which has been relatively untapped, and inorganic acquisitions which they can monetize through their RAMP platform\n* Isn't affected by Google or Apple privacy moves\n\n**Valuation:**\n\nThis is the latest investor [presentation](https://s27.q4cdn.com/320020032/files/doc_presentation/2021/09/System1-Investor-Presentation_vF.pdf).\n\nThe outstanding share count, including sponsor shares and earnout shares but excluding warrants, is 132.4M shares outstanding (Slide 39). You can find warrant count in SEC filings, but I don't want to write a long write up today as I need to go do things today.  YTD net income is at 45M, which means YTD EPS is at .3436, which means that over 3 quarters the company has a Price to earnings multiple of 28.98. I'm going to be blunt and say that Q4 will be a beat, and that **net income will come in at around 23-26M.** This would mean, on the low end, 68M in net income. **This translates to projected full year EPS of .5135 cents, and a price to earnings ratio of 19.396 on the low end of guidance.**\n\nNow, one of the uses for the cash once the merger happens, will be to pay down 176M worth of existing debt. If you scroll down to the Q3 Earnings release you can see the Adjusted EBITDA reconciliation, and specifically interest expense which sits at 12.4M. Existing debt is currently at 317M (Slide 7), and they intend to reduce that by 176 or 55.52%. **This would mean an interest expense decrease of roughly 6.88M.** While i expect cash to be deployed for inorganic acquisitions, that's fine. \n\nFurthermore, restructuring and other charges include onetime charges which won't be seen again. Though I expect once the merger goes through, they'll report the onetime expense of 55M. \n\nLook at page 30-33 of the analyst presentation they released Nov 5 which can be found [here.](https://s27.q4cdn.com/320020032/files/doc_presentation/2021/11/System1-Analyst-Day-Presentation_vFinal.pdf) They address TAM and potential growth trajectories. \n\nFinally, their FCF (Adjusted EBITDA which is operating profit excluding share-based compensation, D&A, and non-recurring expenses) is very strong as they are in the advertising and subscription-based space. It sits at 90M with YoY growth of 123% and margin at 15.2%. Consider the fact that this is still a company that is growing at break neck speed, and you have a winner winner, chicken dinner here.

Like back in July 2019 when Facebook agreed to pay a $5 billion settlement as part of an FTC investigation? The commission found that Facebook was responsible for a range of privacy missteps that violated a prior consent decree (for OTHER illegal behavior) Facebook signed with the FTC in 2012. \n\nThe $5 billion was more 200 times larger than the second-largest fine that the FTC has ever imposed (yet critics argued that the commission still did not go far enough). \n\nOk…but at least maybe he took ownership of that? Nope. Also that same month, the SEC also imposed a separate $100 million fine on Facebook for issuing misleading statements in connection to the Cambridge Analytica scandal, (including initially giving off the false impression that the company had not found any evidence of misconduct). \n\nAnd before you say “well how much did Zuckerberg really have to do with that?” Keep\nIn mind there have been at least two lawsuits by pension funds that claim Facebook massively OVERPAID the FTC to personally protect Zuckerberg (remember how the $5B settlement was 200x greater than anything the FTC had ever levied?). \n\nHow so we know that Facebook overpaid the FTC to protect Zuckerberg? Two reasons\n\n1) Facebooks lawyers estimated the FTC fine would be $107m. \n\n2) the initial draft complaint the FTC sent to Facebook had personally named Zuckerberg. The final complaint was settled for 50x the $107m and - what do you know - left Zuckerberg out of the final settlement, protecting him from being personal liability for “failing to oversee privacy at Facebook.” This also protected and advert from being deposed. \n\nAnd there’s a whole laundry list that in almost endless of similar shady shit Facebook does to manipulate its users. \n\nLike, remember the time [Facebook manipulated its users feeds to make them more depressed?](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/30/technology/facebook-tinkers-with-users-emotions-in-news-feed-experiment-stirring-outcry.html)\n\n> In an academic paper published in conjunction with two university researchers, the company reported that, for one week in January 2012, it had altered the number of positive and negative posts in the news feeds of 689,003 randomly selected users to see what effect the changes had on the tone of the posts the recipients then wrote.\n\n> The researchers found that moods were contagious. The people who saw more positive posts responded by writing more positive posts. Similarly, seeing more negative content prompted the viewers to be more negative in their own posts.\n\n> Although academic protocols generally call for getting people’s consent before psychological research is conducted on them, Facebook didn’t ask for explicit permission from those it selected for the experiment. It argued that its 1.28 billion monthly users gave blanket consent to the company’s research as a condition of using the service.\n\nBottom line, Facebook is company run by a shitty pair of people (Zuckerberg and Sandberg). \n\nThey aren’t trying to make the world better in any way. They are simply trying to mine data and extract as much value as they can. \n\nAnd maybe you say “cool, I like making money and fuck people who are dumb enough to use Facebook”.

{"title": "Amazon 🚀🚀🚀", "selftext": "Amazon earnings per share at 27.75. Rev at 137.4. Was at 17.37.\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/03/amazon-amzn-q4-2021-earnings.html\n\nAmazon reported earnings after the bell. Here are the results.\n\nEarnings per share: $27.75\nRevenue: $137.4 billion vs $137.6 billion expected, according to a Refinitiv survey of analysts\nAWS revenue: $17.37 billion expected, according to StreetAccount\nIt is not immediately clear if the reported earnings per share are comparable to analyst estimates.\n\nAmazon is wrapping up a rollercoaster earnings season for mega-cap tech companies. Netflix shares were hammered late last month after a weak subscriber outlook spooked investors. Upbeat earnings from Apple, Microsoft and Google parent Alphabet in recent days suggested the season could end on a high note, but then Facebook revealed stagnating user growth, which sent its shares plunging and dragged down other social media stocks.\n\nAmong the top tech companies, Amazon was the worst performer last year, with the stock rising just 2.4%. It’s down 16% so far in 2022, as investors rotate out of the sector on concerns about inflation and rising interest rates.\n\nAnalysts expect Amazon to record year-over-year revenue growth of just under 10% for the fourth quarter, which includes the peak holiday shopping season. That would be the first period of single-digit growth since the third quarter of 2017.\n\nProfit is projected to plunge to $3.68 per share from $14.09 per share a year ago. In recent quarters, earnings have cratered and sales growth has decelerated as the company navigates a slowdown in the pandemic-driven e-commerce bump, global supply chain constraints and labor shortages.\n\nAmazon has been ploughing profits into physical expansion, with Jefferies analysts estimating the company opened 350 new facilities in 2021. It also hiked wages to an average of $18 an hour to lure workers and has increased incentives, offering signing bonuses worth as much as $3,000 in certain markets.\n\nIn some cases, the labor shortage forced Amazon to reroute packages over longer and costlier distances to facilities with enough staff to handle them.\n\nCEO Andy Jassy, who succeeded Jeff Bezos at the helm last year, previously warned that Amazon would take on “several billion dollars” of extra costs in the fourth period because of the headwinds. Amazon said its operating profit could be as little as zero.\n\nWall Street will be paying particularly close attention to Amazon’s first-quarter guidance, as investors try to model how much additional pressure the company expects from inflation and supply shortages.\n\nWhile its core retail business faces clear challenges, Amazon is leaning on other divisions, including its profitable cloud-computing unit and fast-growing advertising division. Analysts expect Amazon Web Services to post revenue growth of 36% from a year ago.\n\n“Amazon’s growth, similar to most other e-commerce companies, decelerated all through FY21, and the market is concerned about that continuing into Q1, maybe Q2, with uncertainty on where growth rates normalize beyond that,” Guggenheim analysts wrote in a note to clients late last month. “Q1 guidance will be in focus this week, and the bar seems quite low, but more important will be any hints as to where sales and margins can go from there.”", "id": "sjug3v", "created_utc": 1643922625.0, "score": 347, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 160, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|4|**First Seen In WSB**|11 months ago\n**Total Comments**|19|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=sjug3v)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=sjug3v)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Retail traders got smoked.

In October of 2000, the Fed Funds rate sat at 6.51%.\n\nAt the same time, you see a market that is seeing an aggregate rise in real wages through the 90s, but under the surface those gains were largely felt by high tech workers, with the lower and middle segments of the economy not seeing the same gain rates by any reasonably margin. You also had certain middle class sectors such as the manufacturing industry seeing escalating pressure due to capitalism globalizing manufacturing labor. This was creating a flood of people into retraining for certain disciplines like medical coding, legal support, nursing, etc, putting some downward pressure on those wages over time.\n\nMeanwhile you have overall inflation increasing at that time, but living expenses like housing saw significant increases, as did education costs.\n\nIn other words, what you have in the 2000s isn't a bank capital liquidity crisis, but rather competition for liquid capital that had been going to the market, which was fine as long as the market was going up, but didn't work when it was in decline, resulting in a liquidity crisis nonetheless.\n\nThat may sound like it rhymes with right now and some of the stanzas in the macro sense look similar, but under the covers the wage gains now are largely being felt by the lower segment of the economy, which stabilizes liquidity in and out of markets because the breakdown of lower and middle class capital expenditure pressures almost all corners of the market, but where you have rising wages you can avoid that squeeze.\n\nBut most importantly, the current run-up in the market exists in a context where the Fed increased M2 by >42%, is still adding to the ledger, has no begun taking any out, and where it will take probably close to a decade to pull all of that money out of the bank reserve system.\n\nIn other words, the selling that's going on right now has nothing to do with a squeeze in the capital addressable by the market and everything to do with the standard indicators being unreliable (like the yield curve) because of the Fed's actions and people are trying to extract money out of the market in expectation of a liquidity crisis that isn't actually happening.", "score": 25, "replies": [{"body": "Great write up. Do you think a liquidity crisis will happen this time around? You've taken the position that it's not happening now, but will it?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks and great question... honestly, I don't know.\n\nMy predilection is to say that as long as the wheels don't come totally off the bus, we'll be fine. The banks have done an OK job this time around of not releasing all of the capital, but the question in my mind is really about how much the Fed's actions will influence the credit markets.\n\nIf debt generation potential dries up because uncertainty about how quickly the Fed is going to pull back capital, then you could ostensibly see a tightening of the overall capital liquidity in the economy as inflation eats up capital. If it continues releasing capital quickly enough to keep up, then we should be fine, but at a cost.\n\nThere are also a couple of other concerns, such as the geopolitical situation (not so much Russia/Ukraine or China - though those are concerns - but rather the fundamental problem of regime destabilization among Western superpowers, specifically in the United States where an anti-spending regime could crash the credit of the United States intentionally, which would effectively obliterate the bond market and the stock market and liquidity of the country would go with it.\n\nAssuming that doesn't happen, deflation is still a potential problem.\n\nThe data currently shows elevated consumer spending, debt generation, and demand over the past year/year and a half... but over 2 years it's just trending at baseline. That means that people are still spending roughly what they were before the pandemic.\n\nLet's say all the data's right and the monetary policy hawks have been grasping at ideological straws and it's not the liquidity sitting in banks causing inflation but rather mostly the effects of the pandemic and short-term thinking regarding YoY and QoQ economic data clouding people's judgments, and once the pandemic effect ends (virus goes endemic and low-mortality and confidence returns) then you have potential deflationary forces. What if the car market settles out and all those car orders that car dealerships made thinking that the glory days would never end... just end up filling up car lots and crash the average price of a car through a glut?\n\nBut oh wait... all kinds of other industries are doing that, too, or artificially constraining production like OPEC+ is doing and eventually everything will catch up...\n\nWhat if we're leaning into fighting inflation when the economy deflates?\n\nThat's how you get a liquidity crisis.\n\nOr perhaps banks give in to investor demands in order to drive their margins up and begin releasing more of their excess liquidity faster?\n\nThat would actually create a spending and debt boom. Then we'd have an actual spending-driven inflationary bubble on our hands.\n\nBasically, the future depends on people not overshooting what needs to be done to keep the rudder of the economy stable.\n\nSo far, everything I've seen in the policy suggests that they're aware of this risk, so I think we're gonna be OK assuming the geopolitical state of the globe or Western nations doesn't take a total shit.", "score": 20, "replies": [{"body": "How in the hell you gained this knowledge?

That the Fed is behind the curve and could tighten more without negative consequences and this will not derail the bull market.\n2. That the 2024 election might spark a Civil War in the United States.\n3. That on the long arc, we're in the middle of a cycle where Western hegemony is fading and being replaced by Eastern Hegemony.\n\nOn #1, I'm 50/50. I think the Fed is only behind the curve if you consider their role to be to fight inflation and the ultra-wealthy like Dalio tend to be monetary policy hawkish in angle because of the fact that they're already made their money... so I think it's very easy for people to come out now and declare the Fed \"behind the curve\" because of inflation and the jobs numbers... that's a \"safe\" thing for people to do... but I don't think it's true from the perspective of QE as a risk reducer for the pandemic. I actually think the Fed is moving at the right schedule.\n\nI do agree with him that the bull run will continue overall and that the things the Fed are doing don't change the fundamentals of the market to the extent people think they are.\n\nOn #2, Sociologically it's hard to see how the political divides in the United States are healed. Dalio's perspective is grounded in solid historical patterns and dynamics, but his bias again infiltrates his position to some extent, at least in what I've read. I think for moderates it's very easy to \"both sides\" extremism and Dalio's position falls into that hole, which probably produces a darker view of reality on some level, but at the same time on the ground things are very different. On the ground, right-wing extremism (which I studied in my college career in part by infiltrating a hard right group in the Northeast and studied the methodologies of fascist attempts to change the Overton Window and the tactic of expansion into the mainstream through that) has been growing in the United States since the 1980s and to some extent we've already been in a cold civil war from the right-wing perspective for a long period of time... the left, meanwhile, is behind the curve and only now just waking up to the shift in overall sentiment... so to present this solely as an expansion of extremes is somewhat wrong IMO.\n\nI do think what's happening now will destabilize the country, but that's because that's always been the plan for Fascists in America and it's very easy to destroy and very hard to build in our system, so they have a homefield advantage when it comes to American regressive reactionary tendencies. If you tell people that the government should be disbanded and all the minorities should be put into reservations (a common extremist right-wing framework) you'll get admonitions in favor of serious conversation if it's framed in exactly the right way... if you suggest that we should have universal healthcare or education, you get told you're crazy. There's a malady in American thought that absolutely lurches us towards further conflict.\n\nNow keep in mind civil war looks a lot different now than it did 150 years ago... I suspect it'll be less fighting in the streets and more extreme versions of what is happening now... and that can definitely impact the market.\n\nOverall, the effect of destabilization will be negative for the market IMO.\n\nOn #3, yes, in large part because the process I described above has eroded the Western Alliance backing on which Western Hegemony emerged in the post-war era. But also because of the generally superior overall economic outcomes that have been experienced in the East either through population, policy, or ideal placement. China will eventually eat our lunch on tech. I think if we could hold it together, we could maintain, but the West holding things together is a dubious assumption IMO.\n\nHaving said all of that, as far as the market is concerned, there are lots of negative predictions that never fully come to pass. Crises are averted or the impacts not as extreme... so the advice for playing these scenarios remains the same: Markets generally go up crises aside. Only play what you can afford to lose, and leverage up over time. Maybe keep a closer eye on all of this and leverage down in high risk periods. There are lots of people who sat out the market due to fear (I was one of them on occasion) and it's generally the wrong decision.
