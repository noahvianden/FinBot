Where were we?", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "You may have your fill of answers by now, but the clearest answer is the likelihood of the Fed raising rates quickly seems a lot less likely today than yesterday. \n\nMonetary policy is essentially the accelerator and brakes of an economy. Easy policy (low rates) encourages lending and risk taking. Stimulates the economy and markets typically go up. \n\nTightening, or raising the Fed funds rate (just know this is ground zero for interest rates on basically everything from CDs to mortgages) is like tapping the breaks.  If things get too hot, then it can be bad too. Inflation is the best example of this, too much money chasing too few goods. Raising rates makes taking risks, using leverage etc becomes slightly less attractive, encouraging saving and slowing everything down. \n\nThe goal is to get the balance right, and it’s really hard. Bull markets are often ended because of these moves. But slightly higher rates gives the Fed tools to stimulate the market in the future. \n\nBecause of COVID, stimulus, and whatever else you want to chalk it up to, the market is too hot, inflation is going nuts and look at something like home prices. Too much money chasing too few goods. The market is like a child and doesn’t love easy money (even if historically it is still really easy) becoming a little more expensive. \n\nHigher rates are not bad for all stocks, banks for example benefit. In this part of the cycle cyclical stocks and value have out performed. These companies can make money lending or have more stable balance sheets (over simplified but it does the trick). \n\nWhat did well today is important, it was growth. The stuff that has been underperforming since rates have come into focus.  Growth stocks LOVE easy money. Anyway that’s what spiked because bad stuff, geo political tensions and the will of Washington to use policy to navigate this mess all means rates probably go up slower. Therefore the market rallied especially after hearing Biden’s tone.  It’s confusing but the longer you pay attention the more it will make sense and there is a reason people say ‘Don’t fight the Fed’.  Monetary policy is very very important.\n\nTLDR: The market can be odd and at times will go up on bad news and down on good, jobs numbers are a good example. That’s what happened today.

Never have been. For the better part of a decade I refused to invest my money anywhere else other than my job's 403(b) plan (to be fair, it was a fixed, guaranteed 7% APR so it really was not the worst place to park my money) and my Roth IRA TDF. In 2018 I traded my condo in NYC for a house in Florida and came out with a $100,000 net gain after all was said and done and put that money into a brokerage account in another TDF. This was my circuitous way of illustrating how conservative I am with my money because I very much subscribed to the \"slow and steady wins the race\" mentality. Still do.\n\nThe other pertinent background piece of information (I swear this is all leading somewhere) is that I've always loved performance cars and have driven/owned the gamut of them from Toyotas to Subarus to Audis to BMWs.  All this is to say that I kind of sort of know cars. Or at least, I know how to drive them and I know the feeling I get when I drive a really nice one. Don't know shit about the internal workings of any of them.\n\nIn 2019 when I was in the market for a new car I had my eye on the new Supra, but decided on doing a little (a lot) more research before dropping $50,000 on a new car. That's when I decided to look into Teslas (I'd visited a Tesla showroom back in 2013 in Los Angeles and absolutely fell in love with the Model S, but it was way out of my price range) and I totally went down a Tesla Youtube rabbit hole and stayed up for nights watching videos and reading forums that expressed both negative and positive sentiments on Teslas. Fortuitously, around this time my sister-in-law was getting married in Baltimore and there was a Tesla dealership near where she lived that would allow me to go and test drive one.\n\nAnd so I did. And then I placed my order for a black-on-black 2019 Tesla Model 3 Performance that same day. I waited one month for delivery and I swear that was the longest month of my life. But when it finally came all I can say is that this is the car that I'd been waiting for all my life and that's when I decided that Tesla was the future. I even jokingly told my wife that \"if Tesla isn't the future, then it's a future I want no part of.\"\n\nBy 2020 after about 9 months with my car, my conviction in Tesla was never stronger and I decided to make one of the largest financial decisions of my life: I bought $100,000 worth of TSLA. Since then, Tesla has grown exponentially, even more than the insane prediction of a CAGR of 50% YoY (which, just as a reminder, has never been done by any car company in history before, which further reinforces our collective notion that Tesla is more than a car company) that some very prominent (read: loud) Wall Street analysts were extremely dubious about.\n\nBy late 2020 I became a paper millionaire at the age of 34 and I attribute much of that to my conviction in Tesla. I know that days/weeks/months like this fucking suck, but I think we all need to keep one thing in mind: Tesla fucks. They revolutionized the car industry and they're on track to revolutionizing a lot more than that. As risk-averse as I am, I believe it's a lot riskier to not invest in what I believe to be the company most worthy of being the largest company in the world. And if I'm wrong, at least I fought the good fight. I want to live in a world where sustainability is prioritized, where every car is autonomous, and where my wife and I can both retire comfortably while we're still relatively young. And these are the reasons why I'm holding on to TSLA even when the world is imploding. Because when all is said and done, as long as the world is still around, the only path I can see for Tesla is continued domination.\n\nTLDR: These red days/weeks/months are just blips.

Nasdaq 100 futures declined 2.5%.\n\nMeanwhile, oil prices popped, with West Texas Intermediate futures trading 2.9% higher at $94.79 per barrel. Global benchmark Brent jumped 2.8% to $99.50 per barrel and briefly touched the $100 mark.\n\nThose moves came as Russian President Vladimir Putin said Moscow would launch a military action in Ukraine. Shortly after that announcement, NBC News reported that explosions were heard in Kyiv.\n\nPresident Joe Biden condemned the attack, saying in a statement that “the world hold Russia accountable.”\n\n“Russia alone is responsible for the death and destruction this attack will bring, and the United States and its Allies and partners will respond in a united and decisive way,” Biden said.\n\nThe news came after another downbeat market session on Wall Street, as traders grappled with the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict.\n\nIn the regular trading session, the Dow dropped about 464 points, or 1.3%. The S&P 500 fell 1.8%, moving deeper into correction and ending the day about 12% from its Jan. 3 record close. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite lost 2.6%.\n\nStocks have struggled recently, as the prospects of tighter Federal Reserve monetary policy have also dented investor sentiment.\n\n“Market volatility is normal, but the truth is that the decline we have seen so far is much less than might have been expected,” said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial Network. “That is due to the strength of the fundamentals, which should continue.”", "id": "t017hi", "created_utc": 1645675223.0, "score": 960, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 234, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|29|**First Seen In WSB**|5 months ago\n**Total Comments**|2879|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|5 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=t017hi)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=t017hi)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Crypto market fallling hard too", "score": 362, "replies": [{"body": "What does Matt Damon say in the commercial where he compares speculators buying crypto to the Wright Brother's first aircraft flight? \n\n\"Fortune favors the brave!\". \n\nAnd then I lost all my money.", "score": 182, "replies": [{"body": "Well, you took financial advice from Matt Damon, so...", "score": 54, "replies": [{"body": "How do you like them apples 🍎", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "What if I told you that all those crypto ads are put up by whales trying to exit slowly, and get Main Street to buy it up so they can sell the top", "score": 19, "replies": [{"body": "Then i would ask for proof of that statement.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "This is making that recent South Park ep all the more hilarious", "score": 8, "replies": []}, {"body": "You were bold enough", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "It’s fallen and has had its pants ripped off.
