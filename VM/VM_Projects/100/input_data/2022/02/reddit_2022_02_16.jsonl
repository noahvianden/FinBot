Next I invest into gold and silver because they fluctuate opposite to the market (in a way, dont take this as the whole story it's just simplified).

You probably need to stop playing around with options and just buy and hold companies you believe in.

All you can do now is move forward the right way. For what it's worth I lost a large amount of money with options many years ago. Looking back now it was probably the best thing that ever happened because it taught me not to get arrogant and to appreciate how easy it is to lose money in the market if you don't manage risk. Long-term so long as you learn from your mistakes you may view this experience positively.

You read and understand international news, inflation, economics, politics, and the effect these forces have on a stock.   \n\n\nThen you'll do much better.   \n\n\nYou also need to invest in a company where if the shares fall by almost half, you can shrug and say it'll comeback and be absolutely certain in your conviction.. so that you can sleep at night with such a large investment.   \n\n\nIf you don't do any of this, than you should stick to ETF's.   \n\n\nLast point.   \nIf you think that all you have to do is work hard to get the money, then you're dreaming. Once you get the money to invest, you have to work about twice as hard to keep it, and 3x harder to make it grow.   \n\n\nOnce you have money.. everyone else does what they can to take it from you.

At best you might call it ‚Äútrading‚Äù, which again, is not actually ‚Äúinvesting‚Äù. It is speculation. But you were trading options, which expire because they are not stocks, they are speculative contracts that require certain spreads over certain periods of time to be valuable and that become less and less valuable as they approach their expiration dates. Stocks do not expire, and options are contracts providing you with an ‚Äúoption‚Äù to invest maybe, with leverage, but they are not ownership in the underlying stocks until you exercise. If you exercise only to sell, then again, it was mere speculation, not investing. \n\nPeople use the term ‚Äúinvesting‚Äù loosely, which is inaccurate. Speculating and gambling are close cousins. There is possibly some greater predictability with speculation, but it depends what assets you speculate with and the predictability of prices relative to knowable factors. Given the timing, there was great volatility because the future was extremely uncertain, which increased unpredictability. So it appears to be a great time to speculatively gamble on price movements and if one is accurate, you can both make and lose a lot of money. In your instance, if you had realized that you were not buying actual good assets at a discount but time sensitive speculative contracts, you might have quit when you were ahead and preserved your lucky gains. But no one told you you were speculating. They sold you ‚Äúinvestments‚Äù, apparently, or so you thought. But it was speculative gambling. Everyone has to learn somehow. I‚Äôd look for opportunities to buy really discounted real assets on the next cycle that have potential to come back reasonably quickly, and see how you do then. Brokerages want to keep you trading, but find something that is appreciating and will appreciate a lot eventually and dollar cost average into that asset, even an ETF or index, and you buy more when it‚Äôs down when you dollar cost average your pricing. Sometimes your up, sometimes your down, but over time, you‚Äôre up. Don‚Äôt buy expiring ‚Äúinvestment contracts‚Äù. You have no control over that and you maximize your transaction costs and taxes.

The acquisition significantly advances Intel‚Äôs IDM 2.0 strategy as the company further expands its manufacturing capacity, global footprint and technology portfolio to address unprecedented industry demand. \n\n...\n\n>Tower‚Äôs expertise in specialty technologies, such as radio frequency (RF), power, silicon-germanium (SiGe) and industrial sensors, extensive IP and electronic design automation (EDA) partnerships, and established foundry footprint will provide broad coverage to both Intel and Tower‚Äôs customers globally. Tower serves high-growth markets such as mobile, automotive and power. Tower operates a geographically complementary foundry presence with facilities in the U.S. and Asia serving fabless companies as well as IDMs and offers more than 2 million wafer starts per year of capacity ‚Äì including growth opportunities in Texas, Israel, Italy and Japan. Tower also brings a foundry-first customer approach with an industry-leading customer support portal and IP storefront, as well as design services and capabilities. \n\n\nDisclosure: INTC shareholder\n\nedit: added a section from the press release\n\nEdit 2: I realized I should also disclose than I am an AMD and AAPL shareholder for the sake of transparency.", "id": "stusw7", "created_utc": 1645014764.0, "score": 482, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 104, "comments": [{"body": "As a holder of intel leaps this seems like good news.

{"title": "Google announces privacy changes to Android that will limit user data", "selftext": "[https://blog.google/products/android/introducing-privacy-sandbox-android/](https://blog.google/products/android/introducing-privacy-sandbox-android/)\n\nSummary:\n\n* It's a response to Apple's IDFA change that screwed FB\n* Google had to do something because it doesn't want to look bad and Apple has been touting its change as a user privacy benefit\n* Google's change is less drastic than Apple's, which was announced without giving any developers notice, and without any options\n* Google will focus on limiting the granularity of the user's data available to ads and aggregate more data instead of showing user level data\n* Advertisers will still have data, just less of it, and in more aggregated form instead of individual\n* For example, Google itself will now scan the user's app usage patterns and create an interests profile of the user. An interest could be stocks or pizza. Then Google will share these interests with advertisers. This means Google now controls that data, instead of a company like Facebook that collected this data themselves. This gives a ton of power to Google.\n* Google's change will roll out in 2 years\n* It's more advertiser-friendly than what Apple did\n* But it's still a net negative to ad companies like FB, Snap, etc over what is there today\n\nOne very important thing to note is that Google learned from Apple's change that without cross-platform tracking, advertisers bought more search ads instead because the user's intent was more direct. This led to more business for Google. I [highlighted it here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/sjkieh/why_fb_is_investing_so_heavily_into_vr_if_it_isnt/) why Google was salivating at the thought of doing this on Android too, in order to drive more ad business to its search and weaken Facebook.\n\nFacebook has been renting the penthouse in the Apple Condo building and the Google Condo building. It was a good life. But now the owners of the buildings, Apple and Google, want to take the penthouses back.\n\n**Quick overview of how Apple and Google screwed FB:**\n\nEach user has a unique ID on iOS and one on Android. For example, mine might be 696969.\n\nMany apps use Facebook's ad services. In order to use FB's service, they have to add some Facebook code to their app to track conversions. For example, if I saw an ad for Robinhood on Instagram, I go download the app, I open the app, the little Facebook code on Robinhood will send a message to Zuckerberg HQ that user 696969 has downloaded the app. This allowed advertisers to know how effective each Facebook ad was. Now advertisers have no clue.\n\nIt just so happens that this tiny piece of Facebook code will also know that user 696969 opened this app at 7:02 am. And a finance app at 9:00am. A game at 10am.  And so on. Facebook stores this data and starts building a profile of me, even outside of FB, Instagram, and Whatsapp.\n\nBesides ads on IG, FB, and Whatsapp, Facebook also had the Audience Network. If I made a free app, I could show ads from Facebook and split the revenue with Facebook. Previously, Facebook knew exactly who you were even on 3rd party apps because my ID 696969 was still visible. This allowed Facebook to continue to show relevant ads to users. Not anymore.\n\nOn iOS, FB has no real way of knowing who is who anymore because it doesn't see 696969 anymore. FB is left on its own. Well played, Apple.\n\nOn Android, FB won't see who 696969 is anymore, but FB can request a profile, such as interests, of this anonymous user. But it's now Google that is the one creating a profile of me, and then sharing it anonymously with Facebook. It's a power move by Google. Google is saying to FB, \"you eat what I give you son\". Well played, Google.\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "stzcql", "created_utc": 1645027241.0, "score": 1533, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 159, "comments": [{"body": "Good move by google . \nLong term wise very negative to snap in my opinion.", "score": 334, "replies": [{"body": "this does nothing really, they still getting all the data.  they just gotta go through google.", "score": -55, "replies": [{"body": "Imagine if Facebook was in a desert and has to rely on water from Apple and Google. \n\nApple said, \"Sorry, no more water for you.

FB's sales, operating income, and cash flow not only increased YOY but accelerated, meaning the percentage increase in those keys metrics from 2020 to 2021 was greater than 2019 to 2020. FB was able to do this despite the fact that Apple implemented the IDFA change in spring of 2021. How is FB able to do this? I suspect that FB's e-commerce business is starting to take off. This is a bit anecdotal, but small business owners I've met rely on Instagram and/or Facebook to connect with customers. A florist told me that she couldn't possibly run her business without Instagram as it essentially is her storefront. It draws in customers that she couldn't attract otherwise.\n\nThe privacy change in Android is not as drastic and will not be implemented for at least two years. That gives FB, and other app developers, plenty of time to work on a solution. Also, FWIW, Google said that they will be taking their time in implementing the change to ensure that businesses and developers have the tools to succeed on mobile.\n\nAs for metaverse, it is too early to say whether the massive investments will ultimately pay off, but the beginning signs are promising.

In other words, your valuation of 220-230 is irrelevant tomorrow since you're not buying or selling tomorrow.\n\nMy guess at 275 (which isn't looking good) was based on the fact that next quarter's guidance is so high. I estimated that people were expecting to see 7.7B in revenue, so the 5% beat would push all future projections, and thus the stock price, up by 5%.

The withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan was catastrophically poorly managed. This was a debacle for a president who had advertised in the election campaign with his many years of experience as a foreign policyman. But now, in the crisis surrounding the Russian march on the border with Ukraine, Biden and his team have done an astonishing amount right under the circumstances so far.\n\nAt least the story of the great chess player Putin, who trickes the West with a cool smile, no longer works quite as well. Because Joe Biden and his advisers have shown that they also master the game quite well.\n\nOf course, the crisis is far from over. Putin can still attack or do other crazy things. But there has never been a big war so far. Unlike the occupation of Crimea in 2014, in which Washington was caught cold, no green males without sovereign signs have appeared on the uniforms so far. These are in themselves successes of the Americans.\n\nWhen it comes to war and peace, the mood gets heated\nThe fact that negotiations continue and not shooting are due to an American double strategy. Biden has relied from the beginning to prevent Putin from invading or even smaller military actions with a mixture of massive sanctions threats and offers of conversation. Biden is ready to talk to the Russian president in person on a regular basis and patiently look for solutions to the crisis. He makes concrete offers for talks about arms control. This path has proven to be right so far.\n\nAt the same time, Biden has managed to revive NATO, this aging alliance. He and his diplomats have created a fairly stable rejection front against Moscow through tireless speeches, ranging from London to Ankara. Without a doubt, Putin had bet on quarrels in the Western alliance in his game, but the alliance is surprisingly firmly together.\n\nThis also includes Biden capturing the Germans. Putin's obvious calculation of using the departure of experienced Chancellor Angela Merkel for his purposes has not worked. After some back and forth, the new Chancellor Olaf Scholz has clearly committed himself to the common line with the Americans against Russia. And even if Scholz continues not to say this openly, Putin will have to assume that the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline is actually dead when he invades Ukraine.\n\nBiden also took Putin by surprise quite skillfully in information policy: The Americans are constantly disseminating information from their intelligence services about the alleged plans of the Russians in Ukraine. This should put Putin under pressure. Normally, it is Putin who confuses opponents with information (and disinformation). But now he and his staff are constantly forced to respond to claims from Washington. This takes time, nerves and restricts the scope to come up with your own tricks.\n\nPutin hasn't achieved much so far\n\nOf course, everything can also be very different. Russian troops are still stationed around Ukraine and ready to battle. Putin remains unpredictable and dangerous. But so far Putin has found a lot of strength, moved gigantic troop contingents - and has not really achieved much yet.\n\nYes, he is being talked to again about Ukraine and Russian security concerns. The Minsk Agreement may be revived. Putin is at the center of international attention. But that's it. Officially, there are no concessions from the USA so far. Not one of Putin's main demands regarding NATO eastward enlargement has been met so far - they are so far-reaching that he could not expect them.\n\nThe Western-oriented government in Kiev is still in office. There will be more talk. In the end, this could mean that everyone has to make compromises. Kiev could refrain from joining NATO for a certain period of time. Judging by Putin's big goal of being in charge again in Ukraine, this would only be a small gain for an allegedly so big strategist.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "So Putin gets to finish and make oodles of money off Nordstream 2 and also gets further guarantees that Ukraine will not join NATO, and that no missiles will be installed on his border.

The average interest rate over the last 3 or so years is around 3%.  $400k mortgage balance at 3% interest is $12k per year in interest.

That would still only get you to $17k for home interest and Student Loans.  Unless you are giving massively to charity, or have huge medical bills, you aren't getting to $24k in deductions.\n\n*edit to add:  the SALT deduction is currently capped at $10k for a married couple.  So I suppose if you max that out at $10,000 (pretty reasonable for a home owner in a state like California with property and income taxes), max out the student loan interest deduction at $5,000 (this means two loans of $50,000 at 5% interest), and pay at least $10,000 in home mortgage interest (a $350,000ish house at 3%), a married couple would benefit from itemized deductions.\n\nMy bigger point is that the Home Mortgage interest deduction alone doesn't give a break unless you are carrying a loan much larger than the average home mortgage.

A few percentage points isn't going to be enough to slow this roll.\n\nMortgage rates are already up a lot in a short timespan and pricing in the upcoming Fed fund rate increases. However, the rate of price _increases_ in a lot of areas has only gone up as potential sellers get locked into holding their bags or face massive payment increases, reducing supply further. Wages appear to be keeping pace for now, which means there is little risk that people buying in at seemingly inflated levels can't keep up with the payments. Municipalities have little incentive to jack up property taxes to the point that it forces lots of people to sell.\n\nThere are only a few catalysts I see that could cause prices to come back down. The first and most direct one is inflation (or something else) starts undercutting the economy. Sure, lending standards are supposedly better than ever, but they're also approving folks at much higher DTIs than the historical norm. This means a small disruption to those owners' income could cause a lot of them to miss payments. If this income disruption is wide-spread enough among home owners, that's a lot of delinquent mortgages all at once.\n\nThe other and more subtle, but probably longer-term catalyst I could see is that all of these lenders and mortgage holders reach an inflection point where all of the low-rate loans people now have after the 2020-2021 record-low interest rates (not just new buyers, but sooo many people refinancing as well) eventually get overwhelmed from inflation increasing servicing costs. Eventually it could become unprofitable to hold and service these mortgages if high inflation continues for several years. There are some fringe theories getting thrown around inside of the financial world that at some point in the next decade financing companies are going to start offering cash up front to buy off lendees' financing in return for them taking on higher-rate loans. If mortgage servicing stays in the red for too long, the finance world could face a reckoning.

Sure maybe a couple of apes who bought straight OTM with 0DTE make a few but the real people making money are the people who are running the show. In fact, this whole page which is dedicated to sticking it to the man only allows you to post large cap stocks thus increasing the value for those who already are millionaires while the average retail investor just loses their life savings. This page has turned into the opposite of what it is. Soon the American people will realize that and soon SPY will crash as once the middle class recovers this will go down. It‚Äôs not the rich that control the people. The people control the rich. We‚Äôre their number one source of income. So one day, maybe not today, or the next, but one day, mark my works, the middle class will rise again. If fact, I bet this post gets no love because it‚Äôs not a loss/gain or some BS DD that causes you to YOLO your portfolio into some overpriced POS corporation.", "id": "stsz1w", "created_utc": 1645008321.0, "score": 2, "upvote_ratio": 0.51, "num_comments": 104, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|19|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|29|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lzphsb/dd_on_gild_new_fda_approval/) \n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=stsz1w)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=stsz1w)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Positions or broccoli up where the sun dont shine", "score": 27, "replies": [{"body": "![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275)", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "A crashing economy is a buying opportunity.", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "Exactly", "score": -1, "replies": []}, {"body": "the puts gang has arrived", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Ok you had your rant.

So instead of crushing voters, corporations and the government through interest payments, they will choose to accomodate borrowers over lenders, to prolong the timeframe before a recession ensues.\n\nTo actually fight inflation, the Fed would have to increase the FFR above the monthly increase in inflation.0.25% would do little, if inflation increases by increments of 0.5% (7% -> 7.5%)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vzvm5c85s7i81.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=97f617b1ed2ced25dad376078c980ac6d7654a34\n\nProducer Price Index / Producer Price Inflation is also up 9.7% YoY since January, so there is still a lot of headroom for inflation to go up further, since producers are still tied down through contracts, inclduing futures and are eating to some part into their losses.\n\nFor comparison the cost of steel has gone up 80%, labour 15%, packaging 100% and oil 40%, transportation 45% for domestic products and 85% overseas.\n\nOnce these contracts expire though, we should expect inflation to reach double digits. So while on the surface the Fed will act as though they will tackle inflation, they already chose inflation as tool to deflate the economy, since increasing the federal funds rate/deflation (going below 2% inflation) would be much more servere, with all the dollar denominated debt gaining more value and thus driving the economy into a recession anyways.\n\nIn relationship with futures this would mean\n\n[Futures Expiration Dates](https://preview.redd.it/kxjegiz1q7i81.png?width=1192&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc63966f040f9c93b31a14cf65090776a8750712)\n\nthat in march prices for consumers will go up further and with prices, inflation will go up.Probably the reason why the Fed chose March to hike rates,\n\n[FOMC Meeting to hike Rates](https://preview.redd.it/g54xqco0r7i81.png?width=891&format=png&auto=webp&s=b0295a5baf07c97ade3000ea30f52daa71bfc7ea)\n\n3 days before futures expire & 5 days after the CPI release, giving the Fed at least another month, before consumers, analysts and the media receive this data.

They collect data off of the back of other foundations, hence why those foundations cutting off the tap fucking amputated the stock.\n\nMetaverse is supposed to be that shift. It's their ONLY foundational data aggregating platform available to them, that being VR. Except VR is a niche platform that OP is 100% right has no appeal to the target audience they'd need to want it.\n\nFB got its market cap because investors don't understand how data aggregation works, and assume all data entry points are the same. They're not. Apple and Google have data access at the top layers. Those top layers support their mid layers, and those mid layers and top layers attract users to their lower layers. FB only operates at the mid to low layer and has nothing to retain the users nor expand into the necessary top layers.\n\nThis crash into reality is why they were the first on the chopping block. But they're not the last. Every. Major. Tech. Stock. is overpriced. They've delayed returning to pre-covid levels, and they're trading a decade+ out. There is no fundamentals that can justify that on a company that isn't a rock solid startup.\n\nThe entire tech industry has acted as a safe harbor for the post covid bubble deflation. That harbor has now closed into a handful of top level stocks like Google and Amazon. This is a 1-1 repeat of the dotcom bubble and stocks like Dell. The next step is the catalyst to break those top level stocks that topple the whole beast (in 2001 it was a minor correction that death spiraled. this time I expect the fed hike and resulting correction to repeat this).\n\nThe companies are different. Cisco has been replaced with Tsla, Intel with Google... Ok, microsoft is still the same lol. Amazon with Oracle. The behavior is still the same trend and history says the drop is gonna be hard. Maybe not as hard as dotcom. 50% of nasdaq I can't see (maybe from the covid bubble ATH), but I can easily see a 20+% crash.", "score": 0, "replies": []}, {"body": "Zuckerberg going all in on the Metaverse is a 1000X bigger red flag than anything in this post.
