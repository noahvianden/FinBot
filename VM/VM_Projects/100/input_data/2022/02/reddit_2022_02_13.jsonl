The 80s Apple made computers no one wanted.  End up 'giving' them away to schools so I could make a little green turtle draw a star. Steve Jobs was a con artist.   Pixar was the first thing Jobs was involved with that actually was successful.  Even tho it was going bankrupt till the day Disney released 'Toy Story'.  Jobs almost sold Pixar but at the last second, he realized 'Toy Story' was going to be a hit, so he put Pixar up for IPO so he could cash out on unsuspecting investors.  I think its funny that the product that really set Apple apart was the simplest idea.  In 2001 portable MP3 players.  They didn't create the technology.  They didn't produce the music.  It was pretty genius to start iTunes when they did.  So, their best idea was to create a Napster but actually pay the artists.  It was only obvious; they were trying every way to redo the iPad to transform it into a phone.  \n\n  Once again very little new technology.  Reverse engineering, stealing engineers from the competition nothing new.   6 years nothing new.  Finally in 2007 they come out with the iPhone.  They made it seem revolutionary.....  but it wasn't.

Apple is a cruel cruel company.  They pay all the execs the same ridicules salaries.  I would say Apple is one of the biggest ongoing scams of all time.  How on Earth are investors ever going to make a profit?  Apple makes phones for dollars and sells from for a $1000.  All money goes back into the company.  Is Apples .22 cent dividend how you're going to get rich?  Warren Buffet bought his Apple shares in 2016.  Around $24 a share and has since done a 4 to 1 split. So compared to today's price Buffet paid $6 a share for his holdings.  So, yea it makes sense for him to hold forever.  Anyone who gets in at these ridiculous prices will get burned.  Alot of opinion but a lot of truth in here too.\n\n  One contradictory fact is I have extreme faith in the S&P 500.  It is designed to be able to withstand the ridiculous swings and balance the price by adjusting the holdings.   S&P 500's top holding is APPLE.  That would make you think it would be going up but once again this isn't a new holding.  Apple has been a major holding for S&P since 2011.  They got the shares for nothing compared to today's price.  When you see the S&P 500 reconfigure the fund to lower exposure to APPLE that will be a sure sign to sell as fast as you can.

If you don't think their theme park business is that critical to their overall success, then I suppose don't worry about this potential threat.\n\nThe threat that I'm talking about is probably 15 to 20 years away from reality, but I'd be shocked if there wasn't a sharp decline in theme park attendance starting in about 10 years and progressively moving downwards.\n\nHere's why.... Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality are only going to get better and better and better. One of the huge breakthroughs with virtual reality, is going to be the combination of the virtual and physical, in local entertainment centers. Think Laser Tag for the year 3000. \n\nThe reason people will fly to Orange County or Orlando Florida, is because that's what you need to do, to have a really amazing theme park experience. But imagine 20 years into the future, when every large metropolitan area will have VR Megacenter Entertainment Parks. You can pay a $55 fee and enjoy a 45 minute adventure in an Indiana Jones like world. You'll physically be walking through this world, touching real objects with your hands. Feeling sensations of hot and cold, smelling various smells, etc, etc. All of this will be augmented with amazing VR visuals that will borderline on hyper-real. Better than reality. Not just being equal with reality, but actually better.\n\nYou don't have to go to any airport, or book a week at any hotel to do this. You just have to maybe drive 25 minutes from where you live, to wherever this new VR Megacenter is located. There will probably be multiple business in same metropolitan areas competing in this arena. for example, if you lived in the Seattle area, there would probably be 4 or 5 of these megacenters scattered all around that general area. You won't even be limited to one of them.\n\nNow, sure, you could still go to Orange County or Orlando and get possibly an even better VR/AR experienced that is brought to you by Disney, but if it's only 5 percent better, will it be worth all that drama? I'd say no, it won't be worth that drama.\n\nNow, the big question of course, is.... is Disney well aware of this existential threat to their park business, and yes, they're very aware of it. In fact, they  had an investment in \"The Void\", which was basically one of the very first attempts at having one of these VR centers. The VOID was a failure, primarily due to bad timing with Covid. Also, the VR tech just hasn't progressed fast enough for this to happen.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that Facebook has NEVER licensed any of their VR games for use in VR arcades. At one point I was interested in going into business with a small VR arcade, and I looked into licensing Oculus Quest headsets, as well as access to their Oculus store. I was told by a Facebook representative that they are working on it, and it will be ready soon. This was almost 4 years ago now. To this day, they've never come up with a system for VR Arcade operators to use.\n\nMy new theory is that Meta will actually get into this business themselves. The reason that they're not going to license this for 3rd party VR arcades, is because they have much bigger plans. Maybe someone at Meta has thought of this in the same way that I'm thinking of it, and they think this could be a huge potential growth area for them. They could make these large Entertainment centers built around VR and AR. For both fitness and entertainment. Instead of allowing a company like \"The VOID\", to use their software and hardware, they will simply develop their own \"VOID killer\". \n\nWho could have possibly imagined that Facebook would enter the theme park business?

Just imagine the potential! We could hang out at the Star Wars cantina, role-play as one of the Avengers, or hire Mickey Mouse as our kid's math tutor.\n\nMoreover, I predict Disney will actually expand its physical footprint around the globe to create a bunch of mini-Disneylands that will offer the kind of VR arcade experience you mentioned.

{"title": "A long comment I think deserves to be a post, to see the reactions of people to my thoughts that Apple stock is a turd.", "selftext": "  I think Apple will be the hardest hit on this next crash. Apple isn't doing anything new. They don't actually create anything.  I don't see many haters of Apple but let it be known I am one!  The best part is people who are making the real money, will make money all the way to the top. Then they hit the switch and they make money all the way back down to where they want it.  Their growth only looks like 30% yoy because they didnt do anything for so many years.  Apples total assets are only $329 Billion. The market has this one really f'ed up at  $2.7 Trillion!!\n\n \\-\n\n>Apple isn't doing anything new. They don't actually create anything.\n\nCan you elaborate?\n\nSure,\n\n   They don't own factory's that make the components for the phones.  They don't own factories that assemble the phones.  They don't own mass areas of land or skyscrapers downtown. They rent the highest price space for their stores.\n\nI think it's absolutely insane how people think Apple has been successful.  The movies make things look a lot better than it ever was.  The 80s Apple made computers no one wanted.  End up 'giving' them away to schools so I could make a little green turtle draw a star.  Steve Jobs was a con artist. Pixar was the first thing Jobs was involved with that actually was successful.  Even tho it was going bankrupt till the day Disney released 'Toy Story'.  Jobs almost sold Pixar but at the last second, he realized 'Toy Story' was going to be a hit, so he put Pixar up for IPO so he could cash out on unsuspecting investors.  I think its funny that the product that really set Apple apart was the simplest idea. In 2001 portable MP3 players. They didn't create the technology.  They didn't produce the music. It was pretty genius to start iTunes when they did.  So, their best idea was to create a Napster but actually pay the artists.  It was only obvious; they were trying every way to redo the iPad to transform it into a phone.\n\nOnce again very little new technology.  Reverse engineering, stealing engineers from the competition nothing new. 6 years nothing new.  Finally in 2007 they come out with the iPhone. They made it seem revolutionary..... but it wasn't.  But it was a 'sexy' phone that everyone wanted.  They created artificial demand.  So now for 15 years, they have done nothing in my opinion.  Apple does not help people. Apple is a cruel cruel company.  They pay all the execs the same ridicules salaries.  I would say Apple is one of the biggest ongoing scams of all time.  How on Earth are investors ever going to make a profit? Apple makes phones for dollars and sells from for a $1000.  All money goes back into the company.  Is Apples .22 cent dividend how you're going to get rich?  Warren Buffet bought his Apple shares in 2016. Around $24 a share and has since done a 4 to 1 split.  So compared to today's price Buffet paid $6 a share for his holdings.  So, yea it makes sense for him to hold forever. Anyone who gets in at these ridiculous prices will get burned.  Alot of opinion but a lot of truth in here too.\n\nOne contradictory fact is I have extreme faith in the S&P 500.  It is designed to be able to withstand the ridiculous swings and balance the price by adjusting the holdings.  S&P 500's top holding is APPLE. That would make you think it would be going up but once again this isn't a new holding.  Apple has been a major holding for S&P since 2011.  They got the shares for nothing compared to today's price. When you see the S&P 500 reconfigure the fund to lower exposure to APPLE that will be a sure sign to sell as fast as you can.  Buffet could have the same effect if he let it be known he is selling.  I'd say just sell before everyone else does.\n\nBottom line, Apple has assets of $329 billion and divided by 16.323 billion shares 20.15.   So, of the share price of $168 about $20 of that is covered by something real and physical.  This isn't important but it's something to see.  Market Cap of $2,700,000,000.  Haha!

How this wasn‚Äôt caught earlier on is beyond me. Zillow still doesn‚Äôt seem to know what kind of a ride it‚Äôs in for. Q4 results with forward guidance were very optimistic and seemed to downplay the very serious issue of its current inventory. 2021 created a very volatile period for housing with aggressive buyers willing to place bids significantly over asking price. Zillow played into this game purchasing homes at overvalued prices outbidding others. A direct quote from the Q4 shareholder letter:\n\n*‚ÄúWe‚Äôve made significant progress in our efforts to wind down our iBuying business ‚Äî selling homes faster than we anticipated at better unit economics than we projected. The wind-down process is running smoothly and efficiently, and we expect it to generate positive cash flow. We feel even more confident today that exiting iBuying and eliminating the housing market balance sheet risk to our company and our shareholders was the right decision. We remain focused on continuing to grow our core businesses as we deliver innovative new ways to help our customers move.‚Äù*\n\nA very quick change of attitude from just 3 months ago in the Q3 shareholder letter: \n\n*‚ÄúBecause of this price forecasting volatility, we have had to reconsider what the business might look like at a larger size. We have offered sellers a fair market price from the start of Zillow Offers, while also being clear that the business would only become consistently profitable at scale. We have determined this large scale would require too much equity capital, create too much volatility in our earnings and balance sheet, and ultimately result in far lower return on equity than we imagined. This home price forecasting volatility has also contributed to significant capacity and demand planning challenges, exacerbated by a difficult labor and supply chain environment, leading to our announcement 1 two weeks ago to suspend signing new contracts through the end of this year. We judge future significant volume volatility to be an impediment to ramp a scaled operation, and any interruptions in the supply chain like we‚Äôve recently experienced could result in increased holding times, further increasing our exposure to volatility‚Äù*\n\nZillow recognized its mistakes in Q3, and downplayed them or even avoided addressing the real issues at hand in Q4 in an attempt to please investors, and it worked. \n\n \n\n[Median days on market increasing by the month.](https://preview.redd.it/pxyf88ynklh81.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=c4b3b09b875fcbad05203a5b706411f17ed08f4c)\n\n[Number of home sales dropping](https://preview.redd.it/rhjphizpklh81.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=565ae0dd0270b0d5c20915480f1ef800dd929178)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Active listings quickly dropping](https://preview.redd.it/hyux7rasklh81.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=31d1f0417d1120c17b666f6a54d3bbeba73bf24f)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Median sales prices declining‚Ä¶slowly for now](https://preview.redd.it/m4n0zsutklh81.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ac6921a043ea9d2ed337a508b9b679e9143dbd5)\n\nSo how is Zillow planning on getting rid of over 10,000 homes in a hurry AND provide positive cash flow when there are fewer buyers, fewer sellers, and homes are stuck on the market for longer. The 8,000 homes sold in Q4 brought negative returns of about 7%. The overpriced homes purchased in Q3 at the pinnacle of the housing market paired with incoming rising rates and significant drop in home prices is bound to have drastic effects on future earnings and balance sheets as time goes on. Current home prices are in a downtrend but appear to be flatlined due to a lack of homes of being sold on the market. There is no demand or supply keeping the price steady where it is.
