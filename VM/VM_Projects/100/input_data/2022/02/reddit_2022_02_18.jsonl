On the other hand he's still working, and trying to create a great product.  Also he's acting not reacting, moving in the pretense not a emotional based past tense.

It climbed to 97 before quickly tumbling into the 60s.

FB can build a profile of people logged in to FB and Instagram, but Google knows everything you do on Android and Chrome, so if you use one of those two platforms Google knows everything about you and chances are your ads are being served to you by Google on one of those platforms, which makes their targeting that much better.\n\nFB wants to do the same thing with the metaverse.

Took me over a year to learn charts enough to recognize basic candles. But I like Chart Guys a lot. It’s a YouTube channel that has some free instructional videos that helped me recognize things better. Watch “Introduction to Technical Analysis For Beginners” for a baseline lesson. But you should learn how to set stop losses and other types of protection as well. Your broker and YouTube have plenty of info on this.\n\nThey do daily videos and it’s all free. \n\nAlso, you need to learn basic option strategies once you understand basics on charts. Covered calls and cash secured puts are fantastic ways to grow your account with limited downside. Now understand options can literally ruin your life if you are clueless. So DO NOT trade them unless you practice in a paper trading account on a good broker. From there, look up YouTube videos and STUDY.

Yahoo is choosing to report it as a percentage, without doing you the favor of including a percentage sign.\n\nBe aware that sometimes calculating equity by multiplying book value per share \\* shares outstanding won't get you the answer commonly used. The surprise jumps in when a company has minority interests. Minority interest is subtracted from total equity to get total common equity, and it is total common equity that is used to calculation book value per share... because the shareholders don't have the minority interest.\n\nIf I remember correctly, the normal convention for calculation total debt / equity is to use total equity and not total common equity. With companies without minority interests, they are the same number.\n\nAnnoyingly, I don't see anyplace where Yahoo is reporting total equity. So, it seems that calculating total debt / equity off Yahoo data may be rather challenging.\n\nGoing to the financials on Yahoo and using common stock equity from their Financials / Balance sheet page... ( for example, with DIS: [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DIS/balance-sheet?p=DIS](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DIS/balance-sheet?p=DIS) ). (And, be sure to get on Yahoo's quarterly display, or you'll be looking at annual (and out of date) balance sheet numbers by accident.)... Yahoo lists common stock equity of  89.8 billion. Yahoo lists total debt of 54.13 billion. And, on Yahoo's statistics page they report total debt/equity for DIS as 52.25, which is the exact same format as what you're seeing for the company you are working with.  But 54.13 / 89.86 is 60.24, and Yahoo reports Disney's d/e is 52.25. The missing piece to the puzzle is minority interests, which aren't there on Yahoo's list of balance sheet items.\n\nTime to upgrade from Yahoo to EDGAR. Still free, but a lot more info and a lot fewer errors as well. Here's the latest quarterly report from Disney on EDGAR: [https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1744489/000174448922000059/dis-20220101.htm](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1744489/000174448922000059/dis-20220101.htm)\n\nYou find that, by the way, by visiting the EDGAR company search page ( [https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html) ).\n\nDisney's quarterly report leads off with the income and balance sheet numbers. Looking at the equity section of the balance sheet, there is a line item for noncontrolling interests. That's another word for minority interest. Also, in the case of Disney, we need to check above the start of the equity section for that line for redeemable noncontrolling interests. That is typically also considered minority interest. We add both of these to the shareholder's equity, to true-up total equity to 103.6 billion. That's our denominator. 54.13 / 103.6 = 0.5225.\n\nMaybe more than you wanted? But, you are on the right track, and Yahoo is just confusing.\n\nCheers!", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "This is very helpful, thank you very much. I will check EDGAR for sure. It seemed very odd to me that Yahoo doesn’t show shareholders’ equity anywhere, making me do the calculation manually every time.

Thanks again!!", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I don't want to complain too much about the Yahoo data. I actually appreciate what Yahoo is doing, and I'll use them sometimes when I want to take a quick first glance at a company. I'd format their data a tad differently, and I'd ask for fewer errors, but amongst free sources of public company financial data made super quick to look at, they are about as good as it gets.\n\nEDGAR is the gold standard, but the vast majority of investors don't take the time to navigate it. And, when you are looking directly at the quarterly reports on EDGAR, you have the extra work of pulling up each quarter individually, as well as watching out for an manually adjusting for items that can be easy to miss, like Disney's redeemable noncontrolling interests. Whatever data provider Yahoo is using is doing some of that work for you. And, Yahoo is serving it up free to you, subsidized by its ad revenue.\n\nAnother free source I like for a quick check on things is finviz. But, looking the the finviz page for Disney ( [https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=DIS](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=DIS) ), while they present Debt/Eq in the format I think is more natural, as 0.60, their number doesn't match my manual calculations off Disney's quarterly balance sheet.\n\nSo, Yahoo gets points for more correct data on this round.\n\nIn the end, though, all of the free sources for financial data, and even almost all of the paid sources as well, have issues, and it is good practice, if you want to get into fundamentals and are up for putting the time into it, to pull your numbers from the company filings at EDGAR whenever you get serious about a company.

Some companies didn’t.\n\nSo some companies’ share prices are lower or flat, but valuation or premium you pay for a share is higher. Some companies’ prices are higher, but the company actually outperformed and the valuation has become more attractive even with a higher share price.\n\nEx.

I'll use Intel (INTC) as an example.\n\nINTC rocketed in the dotcom boom with its share price increasing from \\~$20 to a height of $75. Once the dotcom bubble burst, it's share price dropped to \\~$40, almost 50% off highs. From there, it proceeded to drop to $30, staying in that range for a few months, before dropping to $20, almost 75% off highs.\n\nIf you had bought the stock at this point, you would have seen it grow again to $35 a share in a few months (not bad) before it plunged to new lows of $13-14 a share. Buying at that point, you would have ridden the stock back up to $35, before it dropped yet again. For the next few years INTC would go up and down, but in a downward trend, until it finally bottomed at \\~$12 a share in the 2009 financial crisis, almost \\*a full decade\\* after the dotcom bubble burst.\n\nToday, INTC trades at $45 a share, not far off from its price after the initial dotcom burst. Think about the opportunity cost of holding a stock like INTC through the decades.\n\nA few things to take away:\n\nIs INTC a cherrypicked example? Absolutely. Other stocks rebounded extraordinarily well from the dotcom crash, like AMZN, GOOG. How confident are you that the stocks you're considering are the next AMZN and GOOG and not the next INTC? What features of the stock or the company led to your conclusion? Have you done the research you need to do to make an intelligent hypothesis?\n\nWas INTC untradable? Absolutely not. If you had bought the stock at $13 a share, you could have sold at $35 a little more than a year later. That's a stellar return. But do you have a system that will let you capture these types of moves and avoid riding the roller coaster back down? Do you have a price target grounded in reality?

There's just a bunch of weird narratives like \"AAPL = safe\", \"NFLX = bad\".

Sure, they didn't have the strongest earnings, but it was *that* bad either...\n\nFB has an incredibly strong balance sheet and about 20% YoY growth, but has dropped from 30 PE to 15. AAPL also has an incredibly strong balance sheet but has relatively flat growth, yet AAPL has only dropped a few percent. You can't explain moves like this with a fair repricing in my opinion. Especially not when people are buying trash like CSCO left, right and centre because it has a low valuation. I don't own FB, but I also don't understand how anyone can say FB is expensive or a bad buy while buying stocks like CSCO for safety.\n\nNow, if it was the odd stock then sure perhaps you can point to some narrative behind the moves, but we're seeing this same discrepancy play out across the market. Literally every stock is jumping 25% up or down on relatively minor earnings beats and misses. And those that beat are being pilled into for safety. To me it looks like highly emotional buying of perceived safety coupled with selling of perceived risk. The AAPL safety trade is almost a meme at this point to the point people will getting extremely defensive for simply suggesting it's overvalued.\n\nI've not seen this before so I'm not sure exactly what's happening, but the conviction at which I'm seeing people mock Cathie Wood and dismiss growth stocks despite this cohort of stocks being priced at their lowest relative valuations in years while buying stocks trading at ATH's despite rate hikes reminds me of how value investors used to be mocked here while stocks like SPCE were seen as obvious good long-term holds.\n\nNormally whenever I've seen this sub become very convinced it's right about anything, it's completely wrong.

{"title": "$DKNG + $ARKK - Cathie Woods has LOST IT!!", "selftext": "I personally find it absolutely frightening the way the interview yesterday unfolded on CNBC with Cathie Woods. Valid counterpoints were made to her investment strategy that were basically undeniable, and she blew smoke and quoted statistics and tried to make it sounded like she was absolutely competent.\n\nCathie Woods getting into $HOOD has to be the ABSOLUTE bottom for her funds. That stock is an absolute dumpster fire, the worst stock I can think of owning (off the top of my head). $DKNG + $ROKU being the two latest dumpster fires she's hoarding. She's going on about her 5 year strategy (funds won't exist in 5 years I hope for everyone else's sake) while selling Twitter when she bought the position in Nov. '21.\n\nI have five premises here:\n\n**1)** Cathie Woods is NEVER wrong. Even when she's wrong, she's not actually wrong, the MARKET is wrong.\n\nThis reminds me of a person who buys a lottery ticket and claims it's the winning ticket, before the numbers come out. Well, the numbers finally do come out and not a single one match! Hah! You're wrong!! Well, the ticket holder digs in deeper, instead of acknowledging his failure, he instead says that the numbers are the winning numbers, however, the lottery draw was rigged. It will be investigated and the true winning numbers (on his ticket) will then be drawn, and he will be a millionaire. You have to understand there are people throughout history who will deny the truth until their death, creating their own alternate reality, and **these people are the most dangerous people of all.**\n\n**Cathie Woods reminds me of a near perfect mirror image of Elizabeth Holmes with Theranos.** Elizabeth Holmes was extremely well spoken, and she absolutely never waivered publicly in regards to her thoughts on performance, the company, the future, etc. She had people believing against their better judgement because of how charismatic she was. **Avoid these people!**\n\n**2)** She's a money grabber!! Look at that expense ratio!! .75!?! I could see that being justified if you took a yearly or monthly draw of .75 annualized based on total returns of the entire fund since the beginning, never taking draws when the funds are in a loss territory. You think she's going to do that?\n\nShe's also STARTING NEW FUNDS!!! Her flagship fund has nothing but bagholders, and she wants to start NEW FUNDS! The gall!!!! She's cashing out on her image before it blows up in smoke. She'll be relaxing on a hand-built super-yacht, rest assured, when it's all said and done.\n\n**3)** This follows a bit of #2, but she has absolutely no personal risk, except for the future income stream if her funds shrink into nothing. Her management fees are locked in whether you lose 99.999% of your money with her. It's her money, forever. Car salesmen are compensated on sales. They are paid if they successfully sell a car (make the fund above-market gains). The callousness of getting paid regardless of fund performance is to me, ruthless.\n\n**4)** I remember, after losing quite a bit on the buy-button-removal fiasco with $HOOD related to $BB calls / $BB stock price being in the WSB discord telling people my story. The ones who actually believed I could have lost that much money decided they would fix me. \"Just invest in Cathie Woods $ARKK. She's the kingmaker! You just don't know what you're doing. She will carry you across the finish line.\" Must have been 20 people in that chat room and all agreed.\n\nHowever, I had a quick look at $ARKK's holdings and realized that at that time, February 2021, every stock she'd invested in had gone moon-shot and to make it worse, they all looked like pretty ridiculous stocks to me at the time. Well, after voicing my opinion, I was mocked heavily to the point I began to question my own decision making.\n\nPoint being is that someone who has so much charisma, is so well spoken and sounds knowledgeable (Elizabeth Holmes again) are ultimately the ones who convince others to drink the Cool-Aid. They stop thinking rationally about the investments; it becomes cult-like. Be extremely wary when people don't heed your counterpoints regarding stock trades; if they aren't open to obvious holes in their logic, they aren't thinking rationally.\n\n**5)** Finally, she's a religious fanatic. Now, for full disclosure, I am a Christian as well (apologies for bringing up religion), however, she takes it to a dangerous level. I don't care how good my surgeon was, but if I was about to undergo surgery, and my surgeon said he's \"fulfilling the will of God\" by operating on me, I'd be off that table before he finished the sentence. She named her fund after the Ark of the Covenant. Have you guys read what happened to the priests who touched it to prevent it from falling to the ground?!\n\nMoney isn't created in a vacuum. In the stock market, there are winners and losers. If you win, someone else lost, for the most part. I don't necessarily want to get into M1 creation by FED pushing up money supply, etc, but basically, if your fund is beating inflation, you took the money from someone(s). How can that be the \"will of God.\" Chuck, I know you're my best friend and all, but you have to give me your house and sign over the deed. It's the \"will of God.\" God told me!\n\n**TL;DR: Be scared of Elizabeth Holmes #2, Cathie Woods.

When everyone universally believes something is a bad trade you can bet that trade is generally going to be miss-priced considerably. This is why legendary investors advise buying into fear and selling greed. When fear is high assets are generally mispriced to the downside, and when investors are overly confident assets are generally mispriced to the upside. Now, investors like Buffett and Benjamin Graham would probably advise you buy and hold blue-chip companies with low earnings multiples during these periods, but Cathie invests in growth tech and right now growth tech is historically cheap and universally hated. If there was ever an incredible buying opportunity for these stocks in the last several years, it's probably now. Why? Because now seems to be the absolute worst time to go all in on growth tech. Cathie Wood for all her flaws is the only investor in the market right now with the balls to actually disagree with the sentiment and buy. This is precisely why she won so big in 2020-2021. When everyone thought TSLA was going bankrupt Cathie Wood was getting mocked for saying it was going to $4000.\n\n* Secondly, I really don't think it makes much sense to judge Cathie Wood's performance on a year-by-year basis. She clearly doesn't give a crap about what happens in those kinds of time frames so if she's not investing for returns this year, why judge her on them? The reason I'm pointing this out is because it's entirely possible inflation concerns are gone by the end of the year and the FED begins to ease their hawkish stance. If we're currently overestimating how high inflation will be for the duration of 2022 and then how high it will remain in the years to follow it's possible this whole rotation into value has been an overreaction. Perhaps the FED won't be as aggressive as the market fears and perhaps growth stocks shouldn't be trading at their lowest valuations in years and will actually recover quite well over the next 2-3 years. From 2021-2025 she may not beat the market, but from 2022-2025 there's certainly a chance she will. What we know for sure is that when everyone was buying ARKK at all time highs last year it was a huge mistake. Now it's down 60% and is so hated that everyone is shorting it there is a chance now is the time to buy.\n\nBut who knows.

This implies that Tesla made one million 4680 cells JUST in January. This means well over 10k Model Y annual run rate. \n\nExciting isn’t it! Well, I’m just getting started. What if I told you that picture was taken in the first few days of January. How would I know this? Well, let’s take a look at the picture Tesla used in the Tweet.\n\n[2. If you look at how the sun is reflecting primarily off the corner of the glass and shadows on the left of the picture, you can tell the trajectory of the sun (which is lower in the winter and gradually gets higher in the summer). This trajectory, as evident in the glare on the glass and shadow formation, is most evident in the first few days of January. As a best guess, I would pinpoint it to January 3rd.](https://imgur.com/a/izpkW85)\n\nWhat is even better is New Years holiday falls in between Jan 1 and Jan 3,  meaning AT MOST Tesla had two days of production to produce 1M cells, implying roughly a 150k annual Model Y run rate.

In this picture you can clearly see a man closing his right eye while a woman has fully shifted her posture away from the Jan 3 sun pattern](https://imgur.com/a/i8odWNa)\n\nNow I know you saying “sure the sun pattern makes complete sense but how do we move this theory from 99% accuracy to a clear-cut 100%?”\n\nLook no further than bullet point 4.\n\n[4.

A relic of the cold war. Made up of European countries and the US. Original mission to protect Europe from Soviet incursions and keep the Atlantic free and clear. Now, its purpose is less clear but lets just say it mostly exists for the same mission with Russia as its primary threat.\n\nNow, these mostly wealthy European countries and the US have no interest whatsoever in a massive global conflic, any kind of goals of conquest, nor do they have any ambition or taste for a bloodbath offensive strike into Russia. I can't even imagine the scenario now, that would make them the aggressors. Throw in the nuclear threat and its even less likely. The economic loss and turmoil and lives lost makes this an unfathomable option. Russia has to know this, and yet..\n\nRussia on the other hand, has a weak economic situation right now despite the vast wealth of resources the country has. They have a deep rooted, insane paranoia and fear of invasion due to the horror and disaster of the Eastern front in ww2. So from their POV allowing Ukraine to join Nato is a threat they cannot allow, even if they should know intellectually the West has no interest in invading them.\n\nMy thought is, what does anyone gain from Ukraine joining Nato? Why not deny them membership?\n\nIf they join Nato....They would be antagonizing Russia, a much stronger nation. They would get the paper shield of protection from Nato, but if the Ukraine was a Nato member and invaded by Russia, I highly doubt Nato would come to their defense, its just too risky and too dangerous to escalate into ww3.\n\nNato gains nothing from it either, they gain a weak ally and antagonize Russia. They will lose a lot of prestige if they let Ukraine join and then do nothing as they are attacked.\n\nSo while it would mean capitulating to thug Putin and Russia, I don't see how any other move is possible than coming out and declaring Nato will not have Ukraine join and Nato is out of the Ukrainian sphere of influence.\n\nThoughts?", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "There's a lot more to it than just this.

Simple. To stop literally exactly what's happening now and what has happened in the recent past. Russia has already taken control of 2 regions of Ukraine - Donetsk and Crimea. Joining NATO would stop that happening. And the key here is that its not theoretical, Russia has actually done what Ukraine is scared of so no one can argue thats an unfounded fear. It literally just happened in very recent history.\n\nAs for your assertion that NATO wouldn't come to the aid of an alliance member, that seems like a wild unfounded guess. The entire premise of Nato is an attack on one is an attack on all. You can't just decide that \"yeah but its Ukraine, so who cares\". That would erode the entire foundation of the alliance.\n\nSo Ukraine wanting to join makes perfect sense. They want to be free of threats form Russia. Why would NATO want them? That one's less clear, I think the argument is to provide another buffer state between Russia and the major European powers but its pretty debatable how useful that is. I think for NATO its more about demonstrating the supremacy of their cooperative strategy versus Russia's unilateral one. But of course on the flip side allowing Ukraine in would antagonize Russia which isn't on anyone slist of priorities.\n\nAt the end of the day its all a bit of a moot point because NATO doesn't allow members to join if they are currently engaged in conflict.

They have watched as the West has marched right up to their doorstep and plopped down missiles right on their border. It's lunacy to think Russia would not treat NATO as hostile with such an aggressive military expansion and posture.\n\nPutin is pissed that he might lose Ukraine to Europe and he's not wrong, he's worked hard to keep Belarus under his sphere only to find it will be useless if he loses Ukraine and the southern buffer between NATO and Russia.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Exactly.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "There was no formal agreement about eastward expansion.

{"title": "There Won’t Be A War In Ukraine Because Russia Already Won", "selftext": "These are the opinions of a person that comes from a culture very similar to that of Russia and you Westerners need to start understanding just how different we view things. \n\nRussia’s objectives was never to start an open conflict with Ukraine, it was to increase its influence in the region, particularly amongst the states that once formed the Soviet Block and due to the utter buffoonery of the United States, Russia’s plan is a bigger success than it could ever have hoped for. Let me explain. \n\nYou see, unlike the USA, Russia and other eastern countries don’t view open conflict as a preferred solution. Why? Because we don’t treat war as a business model. We prefer cleaner, and longer lasting options. Just think about it, Russia has nothing to gain from going to war and almost everything to lose. Just look at their investment into the Nord Stream pipelines and how their GDP is dependent on oil and LNG exports and you know I’m right.  \n\nThe biggest mistake America and its Western allies always make time and time again with Russia and China is to think that conflict will always be a militaristic one, but in reality, trolling and subversion can have a far greater impact than any army ever could, and Russia, just trolled the fuck out of the US. By moving part of its army close to the Ukrainian border and acting somewhat hostile but not hostile enough for it to trigger open conflict, Russia was able to get a knee-jerk emotional response from the United States. This came in the form of rapid deployment of troops and the supply of armaments, but most importantly, it caused warmongering rhetoric from the current administration. And this, is what Russia really wanted. \n\nYou see, Ukraine was always concerned about Russian aggression, but never concerned enough to cause widespread panic amongst its populace, and believe it or not, they are more focused on domestic and economic issues rather than Putin’s shenanigans. This is because unlike the 2014 annexation of Crimea, Ukraine’s current government is fully in control of the country and Ukrainians are more united than ever, so the prospect of a full-scale Russian invasion that will result in the deaths of millions will always be a microscopic one. \n\nBut that is not what the US thinks. The US, thinking that conflict can only ever be solved through who has the most guns, immediately started beating the war drums and Joe Biden even went as far as to create a literal fucking date for the invasion which was originally this Wednesday before moving it to this Saturday. This kind of rhetoric is carried by the corporate media for the entire world to see and spread and fear and panic amongst global investors. That fear and panic got so fucking bad, it literally ends up causing the Ukrainian economy to go into freefall, costing the country untold billions of dollars’ worth of damages every day. It has now gotten so bad; the fear being spread by US media is now doing more damage than the actual Russians. Don’t believe me? Check out this chart of the Ukrainian Hryvnia to the USD. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1e0baseu4ii81.jpg?width=1084&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=aaf2c294d93911d58ba750b13f4e75a235a49b88\n\nWant more proof? David Arakhamia, the leader of Ukraine’s parliament said the following: **\"There is always a threat from the outside. But! Remember the escalation last spring? Today's situation is no worse than that - it's roughly in the same range, Why is the Western media making such a big deal out of it? It's hard to say,\"** **Arakhamia remarked. Any surprises can be expected from \\[Moscow\\], we must be ready for anything, but not amplify panic.**\n\n**This is diplomat speak telling the US media to shut the fuck up.** \n\nNow for the icing on the cake, even the Russian Foreign Ministry put out a statement, asking Western media outlets to put out dates of which Russia will invade Ukraine so that Russian diplomats can schedule their vacations around it. They are fucking laughing at you. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wsojif1v4ii81.jpg?width=1090&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3782d65f605dc599c79f9a96d7fab034ef943587\n\nDon’t even make me get started on Ukraine’s own president trolling social media by posting that he expects an imminent invasion later this week, which he later clarified to be a joke designed to target the fear mongering caused by the US media. \n\nNow you might be asking yourself, why does this make Russia the winner? Because it damages US credibility and causes its allies in the region to question the ability of the US to protect their interests. Right now, the United States is causing panic that is crippling Ukraine’s economy and all Russia has to do is to say to the Russian population how justifiable its military exercises are because of how radical the West has become. Meanwhile, Ukraine and Russia are already hammering out a diplomatic solution without the US at the table. The Ukrainian president already heavily hinted that they will not be joining NATO, saying that a NATO membership is akin to “having a dream” and Russia in turn is openly supporting recognizing the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, both situated in eastern Ukraine as independent states, which mean Russian backed rebels will finally stop fighting Ukrainian troops. This would mean that not only, will Ukraine probably never join NATO, Russia just secured another buffer zone against the west via the formation of two new independent countries. Countries, that Russia almost have complete control over. \n\nWhat’s more is that other countries in the region are openly seeing the damage the US is causing and are most likely privately questioning whether or not it’s a good idea to get the US involved in their affairs if Russia decides to become aggressive again in the future, and they will. Why? Let’s say you’re Lithuania, a NATO country and Russia starts doing their ‘military exercises’ along your eastern border. You can call in the US, but if you do, chances are, the US is going to cause far greater economic harm than Russia ever could. So what are you most likely going to do? Call in the US and watch as their media tanks your economy or just sit down with the Russians and hammer out a diplomatic solution so you both keep chugging along and tell the US to fuck off if it pokes its head into your internal affairs? It’s not a hard decision. \n\nIn summary, this is death by a thousand cuts. Russia is going to keep on chipping away at the faith ally countries have both in NATO and the US until they view these two things as borderline obsolete. So, without firing a single shot, Russia can eliminate, through time, NATO and American influence in the region all the while forming its own deals and alliances until it is once again the biggest player in that region.\n\nAnother aspect as to why Russia has already won that is not discussed nearly enough is the imminent signing of the new Iranian nuclear deal. Ali Bagheri Kani, Iran’s lead negotiator just publicly stated that they are close to a deal with the US and that a signing is just days away. This info, combined with Biden’s recent statements that they are working hard to lower prices at the pump can only mean one thing: Iran is going to start supplying the United States with oil. Iran, in case you people don’t know, is one of Russia’s closest allies in the middle east. So as Iran is supplying oil at the pump, Russia is going to start whispering ideas into Iran’s ear, trying to use them as a middleman in order to push Russia’s agenda into Washington via shady lobbying dollars. \n\nAlso, on a side note, Iran selling oil is really going to piss off the Saudis since they are sworn enemies. This matters a lot because Saudi Arabia, via an agreement in the 1970s, has agreed to trade their oil exclusively in USD, meaning the USD is NOT a true fiat currency, hence we can print so much without real consequence. This means the US needs to find a way to placate them. This would most likely mean the US will have to take part in additional wars in the middle east to help the Saudis expand their influence, so hooray for that. \n\nOne last thing, don’t count too much on shale, Biden’s ban on drilling on federal land just got lifted in December and its unclear how fast US production can pick up. Apparently, betting everything on the multi-trillion-dollar BBB plan with inflation running rampant thinking the country can just seemingly transition to green energy is not the smartest thing to do. \n\nhttps://energyfuse.org/biden-abandons-plans-to-curtail-drilling-on-federal-lands/\n\nIn conclusion, you Americans need to understand that a large chunk of the world doesn’t think the way you do.

None of this is gonna tell other border states not to bother with the US. Quite the opposite. It shows that the US won't hesitate if Russia starts prodding their border like they have been Ukraine. That they'll take the threat seriously and not listen to Russia's BS like \"yeah guy's, we're totally deescalating rn, nvm the fact that we have only moved a train's worth of easily redeployable tanks and supplies\".\n\nEdit: figured I'd throw this in here. 1-spelling fixes. 2- you wanna know wht the other border states think if all this? Here's a quote from Estonia's PM.\n\n>We have all lost our independence to Russia once, and we don’t want it to happen again. We understand what is at stake here.\n\nThey're taking Russia's threat fucking seriously. \"A culture very similar to Russia\", what is this BS? Do you actually live near or in eastern Europe. If so, actually get an opinion on the situation from them. Because, as you can see, they take Russia as a serious threat and support the US and Nato holding Putin accountable for threatening to plunge them into war.

I don't even know where to begin in disassembling such buffoonery but here goes:\n\nPutin sold gas extremely cheap to mobster Dmytro Firtash in Ukraine from the Russian state owned gas company Gazprom. Firtash sold that gas on to Ukraine and Europe for a huge markup. Firtash used the money to corrupt politics, buy out businesses in Ukraine, and install people in power sympathetic to Russia. Firtash also kicked money back from the sales to Putin and his Oligarchs in various ways so they could profit from the state owned Gazprom gas off the books.\r  \n\r  \nTrumps later campaign manager Paul Manafort worked in Ukraine to revamp the image of Viktor Yanukovych. Yanukovych was a politician, crook, and Putin puppet. Manafort helped to get him elected as leader of Ukraine and Firtash provided the money for him to do so. So basically Manafort and Firtash helped install a Putin puppet leader in Ukraine with discount Russian gas proceeds. Something Manafort himself would repeat in the US years later. Yanukovych proceeded to steal about 1 billion from the people of Ukraine. So basically Russia was in full control there.\r  \n\r  \nYanukovych was ousted as leader of Ukraine during their revolution in 2014. He refused to sign agreements that would bring Ukraine closer to the West and the people had grown tired of his corruption. He fled before the Parliament could vote to impeach and replace him. Once a new president was chosen they wanted to go after corruption and much of that was in the gas industry that was funding these Russian puppet leaders and corrupt businessmen.\r  \n\r  \nBiden’s son Hunter got a job at one of the major gas companies in Ukraine (Burisma) and Joe worked towards prosecuting corrupt officials there. They were going after the politicians and funding behind the corruption more or less. Biden/Obama administration could get nowhere because Firtash had bought out the judicial system including Viktor Shokin the head prosecutor of Ukraine. Biden threatened to withhold 1 billion in aid to Ukraine unless Shokin was removed as prosecutor, Ukraine of course quickly did so.\r  \n\r  \nThis opened the door for the corrupt politicians and business owners puppeted by Russia to be prosecuted. Firtash got arrested on an unrelated bribery charge and he wanted a stay of extradition to the US from Trump. To get it he offered Guliani manufactured dirt on the Bidens and sent two men on his payroll Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman to accomplish it. Parnas and Fruman were in the states funneling dirty Russian money to Republican politicians.\r  \n\r  \nThey all ended up getting caught because the whole quid pro quo phone call got leaked. So the whole thing was because Firtash wanted revenge against the Bidens for dismantling his corrupt empire that let him buy out everyone in Ukraine. Guliani tried to paint it as Joe Biden got the prosecutor fired in Ukraine because Hunter was corrupt and Joe didn't want him to be investigated. In reality the prosecutor was fired because he wouldn't investigate criminals because he was bought out by Firtash and Russia.

I compiled a list:\n\nhttps://pastebin.com/3bLn7CAA\n\nThese false claims were amplified in the west by a network of pro-Kremlin twitter influencers. The aim of this of course is to protect the Syrian government from accusations of responsibility for any future Chemical weapons attacks.\n\nIn 2020, an investigative journalist infiltrated a pro-Kremlin network, by pretending to be a Russian intelligence officer, \"Ivan\". He convinced a member of a pro-Kremlin disinformation network, the [Working Group on Syria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_Group_on_Syria,_Propaganda_and_Media#Controversies), Paul McKeigue, to reveal its inner workings and it's close relationship with its Kremlin handlers.\n\n[How an Email Sting Operation Unearthed a pro-Assad Conspiracy—and Russia’s Role In It](https://newlinesmag.com/reportage/how-an-email-sting-operation-unearthed-a-pro-assad-conspiracy-and-russias-role-in-it/)\n\nFurthermore, researchers at Cardiff University tracked a sophisticated troll network that had infiltrated online news websites, posting pro-Russia and anti-Western comments.\n\n[How a Kremlin-Linked Influence Operation is Systematically Manipulating\nWestern Media to Construct & Communicate Disinformation](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/2551849/final-report.pdf)\n\nI don't think people realise just how sophisticated and extensive all this is.\n\nSo this pattern may predict Russia's future plans, a potental false flag gas attack or conventional attack that their multichannel propaganda outfit will focus on and amplify (Lavrov at the UN, their Military repeating the lies, news stories on their State controlled TV and news websites, various Kremlin-Bots and Kremlin supported western \"experts\" and Think Thanks on Twitter, ~~conservative~~ print media, and online platforms repeating the Kremlin's line).\n\nTL:DR: Russia will use a false-flag as a pretext to invade Ukraine. It will either be some faked chemical weapons attack, or some attack on Russia (perhaps separatists) using cadeavors as the bodies.IDGAF what you wrote because clearly the state news in your area is feeding you some BS. The Western World has chosen the route to declassify a ton of information to demonstrate that we have the best signals collection in the world and to get into Putin's decision-making process. This is in all efforts to prevent an invasion which the West will declare as a victory...many will see this as the West was wrong all along and an example of the way they spin the news, but I'll reiterate...Putin's been looking to invade since Ukraine used the TB-2 drones to attack Separatist artillery positions last fall and we've got the intelligence to back it up", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Holy shit.

Russia relies heavily on US technologies and auto parts as well. The US’s credibility with NATO doesn’t really change anything in a way that would ever harm the US enough to benefit Russia economically or militarily. If the US stops exports to Russia, sure China will pick up the slack, but that will just put Russia under China’s thumb. But again, the whole issue of SWIFT, would make it VERY difficult for Russia to trade with anybody BUT it’s neighbors, most of which, aren’t particularly wealthy countries. Strategically, The US has very little to lose economically from disagreements with Russia, and Russia has a lot to lose. As long as the US can disincentivize Russian military action, it wins economically and militarily, and if it can’t, it still wins, because the US economy can, and tends to benefit from war. That’s just speaking from an economic standpoint.\n\nFrom a military standpoint, the US defense budget is over double the combined defense budget of all NATO countries, and contributes 16% of the total NATO budget, the UK is around 12%. The US also aids it’s allies with additional funding for their militaries. Member states of NATO are not only afforded security because of their other members, they are also afforded security FROM them as well. The US as a world power has the economic and military power to continue to look stupid sometimes and still retain its allies. Basically, they’re the bank and the security guard. Keep in mind too that the UK and the US have very similar outlooks and vested interests economically and militarily, and they sit atop the mountain in both regards. Those two countries make up a huge percentage of the worlds GDP and military spending. NATO is a beneficial organization to be a part of, and the member states are very aware of that, even if it’s members do some dumb things once in a while. \n\nIf Russia’s strategy is to act up to make the US “look dumb”, they might want to rethink their inks. The US has never cared much about their optics because they don’t have to. It has the money, the might, and has made the deals with so many non-NATO countries, to basically get away with whatever dumb shit it might end up doing.  the US has intertwined its economies so deeply with its NATO and non-NATO allies, that there is really no way to  get away from the US financially, without tanking their own economies. Does anyone really think the US cares about optics? They regrettably and embarrassingly, literally threw 20 years and trillions of dollars worth of war, away in 15 mins, just a few months ago, and didn’t even flinch. and their NATO allies didn’t say much. \n\nWhile Russia was busy with communism as the isolated USSR, they wasted precious time they could have spent forging allies across the globe and expanding their economy. When the iron curtain fell in the early 90’s, Russia was already 50 years too late to the party. \n\nI dunno, think Russia is gonna have to do more than just make the US look stupid, it does a great job of that on its own.\n\nBut what I take away from OP’s original post is that Russia is attempting to start some sort of passive aggressive propaganda proxy war between the US and its NATO allies. Russia, knowing the power of propaganda, should realize that the US and NATO consume and distribute their own propaganda, and have for quite a while. The US has fed its citizens and allies a steady diet of propaganda just the same as Russia has. And yet again, the amount of money that the US has and can spend on propaganda at home and abroad, is significantly greater than what Russia’s capabilities are. Credibility doesn’t play much of a role in propaganda either, and Russia of all countries knows this. If credibility played a role in propaganda, FOX, CNN, MSNBC, BBC would all cease to exist.\n\nAll of that being said, the US isn’t actually that cold and calculated, it’s just young and dumb sometimes, but it does want to see the world accept democracy because it makes the world a better and safer place for all of us. And it encourages cooperation. The world desperately needs cooperation right now.", "score": 0, "replies": []}, {"body": "A stunningly clear explanation of Western Buffoonery (pigeons playing checkers) vs Russia/China (brilliant minds who have read and understand Sun Tzu) playing chess.

At first the idea will be you will let your car go out and Uber for you when you're not using it. After all, a [personally owned motor vehicle in the US has on average a 5% utilization rate](https://usa.streetsblog.org/2016/03/10/its-true-the-typical-car-is-parked-95-percent-of-the-time/). That means for this piece of equipment you bought, this capital expenditure, it sits idle 95% of the time.\n\nSo now you start sending your car out to rideshare for you while you're home, while you're at work, etc. Instead of a 5% utilzation, maybe you can get it up to 25%. It's paying your car bill and you're *making* money. That's great!

After all, why should you? They have the capital, the credit, and the lobbying to be the only way you can commute unless you want to take the bus/train from now on.

Think of it this way, NYC back in the 1970 was a crime infested ghetto, but the early bird who bought a house there repair it up. 50 years later, once it's gentrified, it's most expensive neighborhood. So if you really want a house that will go up in value with buying with little money, you pretty have to take a risk buying and fixing up sht house that no one else want and improve the neighborhood enough that it will lure in gentrification.  \n\n\nOr you can apply for a builder apprenticeship to learn how to build a house. Course program is usually 3-4 years. Then become a general contractor and build your own house at cost. And sell your other house to corporation so the more asset price inflate, it actually benefit you. People complain that they cannot save up enough money 30 years to buy a house, maybe consider just learn how to build a house in 3-4 year instead and build a house in 1/5 of time.  \n\n\nOr you scan mls site constant and watch out 24/7 for irregular listing that pop up every 6 month that's 20% below market value.

Can't really expected a house to fall effortlessly onto your hand. So it's really depend which resource advantage you current situation have.  \n\n\nThere are also more creative solution out there to buy expensive house for cheap that sacrifice other type of resource beyond just labor, time and money.  \n\n\n1) buy a house for 20% below market value by agreeing to let the existing family to continue live in house while you move in. Essentially 20% will act like the rent for the existing family who's now living in your house. So this way they don't have to worry about finding another overvalue house to live in and get to enjoy the rise in asset value without worry about finding replacement. And you get to enjoy lower price. People want convenience and speed more than price. You'll be surprise how well and how often this works out. You do need to share your living space with an existing family, so privacy is sacrifice  \n\n\n2) Find an investor to buy a multi-family house, then rent out and airbnb the spare room to pay for mortgage and just enjoy the common living space. This one is actually pretty common, one thing rich people want more than money, it's ability to not having manage asset and monitor every little thing. So they can focus their attention on other activity that makes them more money. So in this case, you'll be buying the house, maintain it, make sure to keep it's always full of tenants, effectively doing an apartment manager's job but getting paid in the ability living in a bigger house.

Home Price relative to incomes is insane.  The people are buying now are millennials who have been fucked out of homeownership for nearly two decades and want to start families and own real estate, and the loans are basically free. (Free money = HUGE red flag) So in essence banks are giving shitty loans again…(30 year loans at WAY below inflation) But banks are getting a golden deal because the FED is buying all of their trash loans.  \n\nThere’s only two ways this can play out. \n\n1.a. Inflation gets out of hand.  Asset prices will skyrocket initially but if the cash that is created does not reach homeowners, homeowners will be forced to sell to get the cash they need to live.  This will crash the market.  At the same time banks who get the privilege of offloading their shit loans to the fed will have a field day and buy up everything.  This is where I believe OPs scenario of renting forever will come into play.  Cause right now real people are buying.  In order for the rent forever scenario to play out you have to get people to sell to banks.  Also I don’t think we can keep going on current pace without a major correction because home price relative to rent (even for a free loan) wont make sense anymore.  The banks still need wage slaves to pay rent and there is a limit of how high this can go.  They need another crash to force more people out.  \n\n1. B. Inflation gets out of hand and there is enough or excess cash created that reaches homeowners, the value of the dollar will plummet because everyone has dollars.  This will cause all sorts of crazy problems.  Demand for gold, silver, Bitcoin will surge.  My opinion is that This will likely cause a revaluation of certain home prices relative to other real assets and incomes. Since this ratio is way out of wack at the moment, I think the housing market in cities will plummet, but demand for homes with land will go up. \n\n2. Interest rates go up.  This is self explanatory.  All asset prices will plummet.  \n\nTLDR.  I think we will see another crash and what we are seeing now is a massive bull trap.  7% inflation (real inflation way higher) yet 30 year loans at 3-4%.

I do want to add a bit of color to one of their statistics.  \"First Time Homebuyers: 30%- an all-time low.\"  Please note that this is not by choice.  This is not evidence of lack of individual demand.  OP's point is that potential first-time homebuyers are being squeezed out by these very corporations being discussed, as well as by over-regulation.  \n   Not too long ago, in my area we could build and make profit off a \"starter home\" in the $225,000 range.  Now, with the price of land, materials, etc, you'd have to sell that same house for $300,000 just to break even.  So, the business model of building even \"modest\" houses requires building larger and larger homes.   \n  When I was a kid, everything was 1/4 acre lots.  Every hundred feet I rode my Huffy, I passed another house.  Now it's minimum 250-foot frontage and 2 acre lots.  So, more money for the upfront costs of land, longer driveway, more sitework, etc.  Every cycle of the building code requires more excessive insulation and energy efficiency, to the point that houses are so tight they need a mechanical air exchanger to let the house breeze and let moisture out.    \n   So you add all these things, plus the surge in material costs, then put these nascent families up against corporations in a bid for the few houses that come on the market, and the OP is right, you're never buying a house.   \n   A post I saw yesterday summed it up best.

That crash was caused by inflated housing prices and subprime mortgages - they were giving mortgages out to people with no doc loans, and no ability to pay them.  And when the house values dropped, they couldn't even sell them to get out from under so they went to foreclosure sale - which in my state at least, is a cash auction - regular people can't do that. \n\nHow is it spillover?  Well - \nHousing prices went so low that people who could never afford to buy real estate for cash suddenly could.  They turned them into rentals and had a good rental market because of all the new tenants caused by foreclosures.  This allowed the investors to buy houses quickly.  When the market returned, they were able to sell the houses for a HUGE profit, and then reinvest the cash into buying more rental properties.  There are now a lot more real estate investors buying up property.  Some actively go overseas to raise money from foreign investors.  \n\nNow, at the same time this was all starting, you had a whole bunch of people with now ruined credit because of the foreclosure on their record.  Some have never recovered.  Also, because of the subprime mortgage disaster - it is harder to get a loan.  You also have a lot of available housing owned by the new real estate investors, and that is their business now, so why would they give it up?  \n\nAnd NOW, well people can't afford the houses in this inflation and new construction is just not feasible with the supply chain issues and cost of materials.  And people who lost everything with the foreclosure of their homes and then had to pay rising rents have not been able to save.  \n\nFor a while - HUD tried to only market their foreclosures to owner occupants for the first 90 days  - but people had not recovered from the crash enough to take advantage of it, so investors scooped them up after the 90 days.  And you can't force private individuals to turn down better offers in favor of owner occupants.  Plus, the issues with FHA and VA loans?  Those are a PAIN.  And if the appraiser notices anything, they will want the seller to fix it.  Sellers don't want to deal with that, but then the buyer can't get the loan.\n\nThere are sooooo many issues that are at the core of this problem.   There are already taxes to be paid on rental income and investors do not get tax breaks on property taxes, but it is a businesses, so business expenses are write-offs.

So much money they had to find new places to put it (for housing there were always investors but it has escalated massively).  These wealthy individuals know that these market bubbles are due for a correction which is already underway, so a lot more money is pouring into buying up housing.  I agree one way to try and address this is through taxation.  Buying up existing single family homes or condos as an investment should have a higher tax burden.  Keep the tax write offs for people living in their own homes, but for investors you could use the homes appraised values already done for property tax purposes to charge a capital gain on investment properties on an annual basis.  Otherwise they could avoid this tax by just not selling.  Counter that with a lessor tax burden  for investments in new housing which would improve supply and put a further damper on prices.

By the time I listed it after I’d moved for my new job there were only 5 houses available in the entire neighborhood, 3 of which hadn’t even been built yet and were already being sold, and my 40 year old fixed-up house ended up selling for as much as those not done yet new homes sold for and in the entire city there were less than 200 homes on the market at that time and that was a year ago as of now.\n\nSo it’s not like there were a bunch of houses in that neighborhood sitting empty and already snatched up by investors. There were a bunch of wooded lots that hadn’t been built on and “developers” came in and started buying them and building and selling brand new houses on them which drove the prices up and people who had lived there for decades started selling their houses and things went crazy.\n\nThe first buyer’s financing fell apart for my old house and someone who had seen it but didn’t make an offer in time was under contract on another house in a different neighborhood and dropped that deal and jumped on mine the day the first guy’s loan fell apart and we changed it back to active. Just 3 weeks later they went to closing and moved in 2 days later and they’ve been there all year.\n\nThey paid about double what I bought it for 4 years earlier (and I had also moved into with it still in need of work). \nGranted it was much nicer by the time I was done with it but I did the basic stuff it needed, documented everything, was truthful about all I’d found and all I’d done and what they might consider doing down the road, and they loved what they saw and they’re happy to have it and I’m happy for them.\n\nI’m not an investor or a flipper. \nI didn’t want to leave that house but I needed a new job and couldn’t find one in my field anywhere in and around that area so I had to move out of state.\n\nIf housing is unobtainable where you live then maybe it’s time for a change of scenery.\n\nThere are tons of cities that I can’t afford to live in as a renter or as a buyer.

There is definitely a housing shortage (in certain parts of the country).\n\nYou have to be careful with your analysis.  Sure, as you state, when expressed as percentages housing stock has grown faster than population.  But when you express the data as actual numbers you will see by your own numbers that population has increased by 39 million, while housing units have increased by 19 million.  By that math, there are 20 million more new people than there are new housing units.  \n\nBut it's more than these numbers. You don't just match one house to one household. There is the matter of affordability. One new unaffordable house does not just get occupied by one household in need of a place to live.  \n\nThis begs the question: why isn't housing more affordable? \n\nShort answer: not enough supply.\n\nLong answer: zoning codes in many major metros have not been updated in decades. Furthermore, many cities add significant fees and permitting requirements to developers as a way of generating revenue.  This means that a profit-driven developer needs to charge higher to make a return on investment.  So the properties that do get built are high end properties that are not often affordable (absent tax incentives and such). \n\nSo how do we solve this? A couple of ways.  City zoning administrators need to update zoning code to allow for smaller and denser developments. Residents need to get used to smaller developments. Everyone needs to realize that luxury housing stock still adds to the supply of overall housing, and therefore moderates the price of older or less luxurious housing stock.  \n\nAlso, renters could theoretically unite under an anti-rent banner, similar to anti-work, I suppose.  The risk here would be that they might end up living on a friend's sofa or in a camper van or on the street.
