{"title": "Serious question for Retail Tech Investors", "selftext": " So I've been thinking, Is the reason that the majority of retail traders are so overleveraged tech stocks is because that's all that they know? Obviously new things are exciting. But the majority of the USA work force today are likely office workers. And they know how Microsoft, Apple, AMD, etc work cause they use those products everyday??? And they are okay buying those growth stocks at very high valuations. But as a blue collar guy I have never bought heavily into any of those tech stocks with what I thought were nose bleed valuations. And I've always bought stocks that I can understand. That's why I own stocks like $CLF, $BP, $KMI, $WNC, $GT, and other manufacturing & commodity stocks. And I am not against tech as I am fine buying & holding stocks like Intel that are used in everything that have cheap valuations.\n\nBut my question is, do we all have bias based on the bubble we live in?

For example, if you want to own a lot of risky stocks it probably makes sense to have some of your portfolio in very stable names to reduce potential volatility to more manageable levels, but if you're young and own a few large-cap tech stocks the benefit of diversifying into other sectors to reduce volatility is going to be limited.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I think that maybe there's a bias, but Tech stocks have been the biggest market cap companies for a while now, and many older folk are the majority investors in these companies anyways. \n\nAlso, it seems naive to say that because I consume tech that I know how any of the companies or tech itself works.

The year-over-year forecast of 7.2% is the highest since 1982 and is up from 7% in December.\n\nCore inflation, excluding food and energy, is expected to rise 0.4% in January or 5.9% year-over-year, according to Dow Jones. That compares to a monthly increase of 0.6% in December and a year-over-year pace of 5.5% in the final month of last year.\n\nCPI is key for the markets since inflation is seen as a direct trigger for the Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes, and economists are basing their forecasts for the central bank on how much they think inflation will slow from its rapid pace. The Fed has made clear it will fight inflation, and it is widely expected to raise interest rates multiple times this year, starting with a quarter-point hike in March.\n\n\nEDIT: Link has been updated", "id": "sp6qce", "created_utc": 1644499976.0, "score": 2917, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 530, "comments": [{"body": "UPDATE: 7.5%", "score": 1033, "replies": [{"body": "Doooooooom sell everything!!!!", "score": 299, "replies": [{"body": "He sold?

It gave me the feeling that, of the \"acceptable\" yearly wage inflation, maybe 2-3%, the available increases have gone mainly to the top, almost hiding in the average.\n\nI think the effects of that trend only compounded to become truly significant recently, and events such as 2008 have the ability to sweep the leg of the lower wage earners while those with assets can capitalize on the situation. It seems the average worker, and as a result the world, has been cheated out of deserved wage inflation, and has set up our economy to be anything but resilient.\n\nIf the lower wage earners had seen the moderate growth, they would likely have better savings than now and better ability to withstand rate increases as it effects their daily life. This alleviates some risk of the \"too much rate hike too fast and recession/depression\", as the working class would have a buffer.

Essentially, prices will rise when you start hitting constraints that prevent increasing output sufficiently to meet demand. Constraints can occur in capital, labor, or raw materials. \"Capital\" in this sense just means physical investment in things like machinery and equipment. \n\nOne of the constraints we are seeing right now is in labor markets. Unemployment has fallen quickly to 4%, the numbers of continuing claims for unemployment insurance are hitting lows we haven't seen since 1970, while the number of job openings is at record highs, and about double what it was only 7 years ago. \n\nBut there are also some constraints in some raw materials, as well as some intermediate goods (like some parts for automobiles), as well as some supply chain issues also helping to limit the ability of supply to sufficiently expand to meet demand. \n\nOn the demand side, we had fairly high levels of fiscal stimulus even before Covid hit, with a deficit of nearly $1T in 2019. That jumped to over $3T in 2020. And it didn't improve much with the new administration, it was $2.7T in 2021. That's over 11%  of GDP (the entire output of the U.S. economy). \n\nAs for monetary policy, the Fed, after inducing a significant recession in 1981, with an effective federal funds rate that hit 20%, in order to stem double digit inflation, the Fed for the following four decades generally erred on the side of being tight, rather than loose, leading to decades of falling inflationary expectations and long term interest rates. Monetary policy has been looser over the past decade, but despite that, the Fed still consistently missed it's 2% inflation target to the low side, and the 10-year treasury yield hit a record low of only 0.55% at the end of July 2020 (and actually 0.52% on 8/4).  \n\nSo I think the Fed actually wanted inflation to run a little hot here, given how hard it is to change those longer term expectations. But they can't have wanted it over 7%. Typically, if the Fed Funds rate (a critical short term rate) is much less than inflation, monetary policy is stimulative. To have it still at zero, with inflation over 7% is very stimulative.

For example, imagine that a person holds a belief that left-handed people are more creative than right-handed people. Whenever this person encounters a person that is both left-handed and creative, they place greater importance on this \"evidence\" supporting their already existing belief. This individual might even seek \"proof\" that further backs up this belief while discounting examples that do not support this idea.\nConfirmation biases impact how people gather information, but they also influence how people interpret and recall information. For example, people who support or oppose a particular issue will not only seek information that supports their beliefs, they will also interpret news stories in a way that upholds their existing ideas and remember things in a way that also reinforces these attitudes.”\n\n\nNo where in my post does it say or do I show any evidence of only wanting to hear good news about NVDA….

If they start aggressively enough it could allow the market to do most of the work for them without the need to actually raise rates significantly and potentially trigger a recession.\n\nI have no academic background in economics though so I might be wrong.

The worst inflation in U.S. (or maybe just 20th century U.S.) history came in the 70's largely off of oil crises because of OPEC embargoes. It was unprecedented. \n\nRaising rates tempered far worse inflation in an environment with no rule book back then by doing what's it's supposed to, increase the cost of borrowing.

Not sure what you're premising that on.\n\nMore harm than good? How exactly? You don't give any explanation as to why that's the case. What's the good being done, the bad, and why does the bad outweigh the good.\n\nGenerally, interest rates are raised because they do more good than harm, though it is undeniable they do some harm. But that is kind of the point. An overheated economy needs some cooling down, which naturally comes with some negative externalities. In order to deal with stagflation Volcker crushed inflation first, driving the economy into recession, then eased rates to allow it to grow.

{"title": "The End to the Madness is Coming Soon! 🐻🐻🐻", "selftext": "So for those of you who really want to know what's going on...here it is. I implore you to actually read this even though it's long. It will be very important to see what happens over the next couple years (or even months):\n\n\\- Our Fed is either lying or is completely feckless/ignorant about the inflation situation. I think they are lying because they don't want to incite panic. There has almost NEVER, I repeat NEVER been a time in our history when inflation has been calmed by a Fed Funds Rate below the inflation itself. In most of our history, the Fed Funds Rate has always been HIGHER than inflation, particularly during times of high inflation when the Fed needed to calm it. So to think, a hike of .25% is going to get the job done against what is now 7.5% inflation and counting is absolutely comical . A complete joke if we're being honest  😂😂😂. They will have to raise rates MUCH faster and quicker than they've said. Which brings me to point #2.\n\n\\- The Fed may genuinely THINK inflation will come down on its own when supply side issues are resolved, and the labor market isn't as tight, blah blah blah. Guess what? The Fed of the 1970s said the exact same thing. Instead of admitting responsibility (the historically loose monetary policy is probably 90% of what caused this inflation), they will look to other causes to save their own asses. Well the Fed 100% perpetuated this inflation. The only way they will get it to come down is by doing what the Fed finally did in the late 70s/early 80s and that was to hike rates SO ridiculously high (it peaked around 20%), that inflation was finally defeated. By the way the inflation at that time maxed at just under 15%, so the Fed Funds rate was hiked Well above that to quell the inflation problem. Think of what 10% Fed Funds rate within a year would do...well that brings me to my next point\n\n\\- Bonds will take an absolute epic shit. Followed by the biggest stock market crash in our market's history. Short either of these with LEAPS and you will make lots of money. If you're able to time short term moves even halfway decently, generational wealth is on the table. People will argue \"but the stock market did fine in the 70s and 80s. Blah, blah, blah.\" Firstly it was a very different situation. They weren't in the most overpriced market in history by almost every fundamental metric (and not just stocks, remember we're in an \"everything\" bubble with bonds, real estate, internet money, etc. even trading cards!). Secondly, they didn't have a global pandemic that still threatens a potential recession. And lastly, the market of the 70s and 80s actually had a massive period of negative \"real returns.\" It was one of the worst performing markets in history when accounting for the huge inflation that wiped away the nominal returns. We may see one final run for stocks in the next couple months, but the big crash is coming and there's no way around that.\n\n\\- Lastly, I would like to emphasize the severity of the situation, not just in the US but globally. Every country is experiencing high inflation, because EVERY country instituted this ridiculously loose monetary policy when the pandemic happened (I really am shocked how they all could be so dumb...did they actually have to take economics classes to get their degrees? Unfortunately, it became a \"they're doing it, so it must be okay if we do too!\" situation). The UK has already rate hiked twice and this hasn't done shit to slow down their inflation. They are also seeing what we will likely start to see here (or maybe already have): A price wage spiral. When inflation increases, workers start demanding higher salaries to compensate for the money they lose to inflation. Well, businesses have to pass those increased salary expenses back through the sales of their goods and services, thus creating a loop of price increases and higher inflation. If you don't believe me, google \"Andrew Bailey, pay raise\" and see what pops up  😂😂😂. He's essentially the \"fed char\" of England's central bank and is facing huge backlash for asking workers not to ask for pay raises. As hilarious as it is, his request would probably help slowdown inflation but we can see there is no way that's going to happen and if Powell says that here, he will look just as bad as Bailey.\n\nTLDR: In short inflation can only be stopped by one thing at this point. Not supply chain issues being resolved, not the pandemic going away. Fast and furious rate hikes which will ultimately crash the \"everything bubble\" we have had building for the last 13 years. Enter those short positions and get ready for some fun fellow bears 📉📉📉🚨🚨🚨🐻🐻🐻 But epic buying opportunities will manifest at the end of this, so be ready to scoop up your favorite equities at insane discounts!\n\nTLDR 2: Short everything!

Thirty years later the median family income was $59,938. We'll round that up to $60k. So you need to 6x your money just to tread water. \n\nWhat do we need to get wealthy then? At least 20x that annual total to even begin to crack feeling wealthy. Think about it, if median income is $50k a year, twenty times that is only one million. If you have one million dollars right now are you wealthy? No, not really. It's better than not having a million dollars, but you're still working with that amount.\n\nSo, we take our current median household income of $67,521, as of 2020, we assume it will essentially 6x by 2050, giving us a median income of $405,126. Historically minimum wage is around a third of median household income. So in 2050 a 16 year old flipping burgers will be getting paid over $125k a year. You'll need at least $8.1million to just barely feel as rich as somebody with exactly $1.35m does today, which is better than not having it, but still requires working to cover your bills.\n\nBe honest with yourself, are you really on track to even have $8m? To be actually wealthy, as in not needing to work and able to live off your money, you probably need at least three times that. Raise your hand if you're on track to have $24 million in the next 28 years.\n\nETA - Minimum wage being six figures is the part that really matters. If you come up a bit short, and have say $5m in thirty years which sounds like a lot now, it's going to go real fucking quick when you have to pay six figures just to your lawn guy, maybe double that for skilled nursing assistance, etc. The median home price tends to track within a certain range of the median income so you're paying taxes on a home valued in the millions, even though it's the same shitbox you live in now just with 30 years of wear and tear on it. This is why old people tend to be broke even if they've been putting some money into the market every year. 10% of their 1970 wage was a few hundred bucks.
