{"title": "Meta isn't going anywhere", "selftext": "Meta falls by 33% and lo and behold, like clockwork this sub is filled with high IQ geniuses explaining that facebook is finished, that Zuckerberg is going to end up selling metaverse handjobs behind a metaverse dumpster for meta money in the near future, that this is it, this time facebook will be replaced by x y or z competitor. Here's why that is insanely stupid:\n\n**Instagram and facebook are the best place to spend money on ads, the only competitor that comes close is Google/Youtube.**\n\nIf you want to grow a business or start a side hustle, a couple hundred bucks gets you massive exposure to whatever target audience you want. You are basically given the power to put a billboard on the front door of anyone who you think might be interested in your product. Other social media sites offer this, but not even close to the same scale as meta does, instagram/facebook gets you exposure to every demographic in the world. Other social media sites, like snapchat, or tik tok, are limited to a specific demographic, such as young people, and there are significantly less options for your ad types and metrics around the ads.\n\n**Metaverse**\n\nIt's kind of amazing to me how someone will have faith in Elon Musk building economically feasible transportation to Mars but not in ZUCC taking over the VR industry with an ambitious MMO.\n\nI mean just the word \"metaverse\" was brilliant, ZUCC could have just made an \"MMO\" like Amazon tried to and called it such, but instead he made people believe he is coming up with something different and not just a rehash of any of the number of online chatrooms that involve created avatars that have come and gone since the 90's.\n\nThat's what ZUCC does, he might not have invented social networks, but he made them into what they are today. Likewise he didn't invent \"metaverses\", but if there's someone out there that can get the average person wearing a VR headset and performing all their social functions virtually without ever leaving their houses like some sort of dystopian nightmare, it's the ZUCC.\n\n**It is literally impossible for Facebook to not grow**\n\nFacebook has 2.89 billion users worldwide. Instagram has over a billion users worldwide. The global population is 7.75 billion. At 3.89 billion accounts, somewhere in the ballpark of half of the entire human population uses a meta application.\n\nKnowing that, I can understand being skeptical of Meta being able to capture more ad revenue from it's users. But if you think facebook is going bankrupt, or even that it won't grow at all, when it's already consumed close to half the earth in it's social media cesspool, you are literally retarded. Several continents would have to be destroyed to seriously harm Meta's userbase.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, I don't know if I am going to buy Facebook just yet, I don't know what it's fair valuation is right now. It could be that this is a fair correction. But on a fundamental level, it's definitely as solid as any tech giant is, and any moron here spouting drivel about how this is the end of Meta is a clown, Facebook and Instagram will not only exist in 50 years, they will likely be several times as big.", "id": "snzuw6", "created_utc": 1644367351.0, "score": 44, "upvote_ratio": 0.61, "num_comments": 107, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|19|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|419|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p4nsuz/ups_is_the_next_gme/) \n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=snzuw6)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=snzuw6)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Have you heard of LIGMA?", "score": 33, "replies": [{"body": "No what’s LIGMA", "score": 17, "replies": [{"body": "Ahh, I'm glad you asked, sir.\n\nLIGMA balls Lol \n\nAlso Loopring ImmutableX GME Microsoft Apple", "score": 30, "replies": [{"body": "Instructions not clear.

Of course I could just be wrong but I'm trying so hard to see how I could be wrong and just can't. \n\nOkay so here's the data. Note: I don't know what the formula is for seasonally adjustment so I'm using unadjusted values. The YOY figure that everyone cares about anyway is unadjusted so this should be fine\n\n&#x200B;\n\n||*CPI Index*|*Month to Month Change*|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Jan 21|261.582||\n|Nov 21|277.948||\n|Dec 21|278.802|.307% |\n||||\n|Jan 22 (at 7% YOY)|279.893|0.391%|\n|Jan 22 (at 7.3% YOY)|280.677|0.673%|\n|Jan 22 (at 7.4% YOY)|280.939|0.767%|\n|Jan 22 (at 7.5% YOY)|281.201|0.860%|\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOkay so if we only have 7% inflation y/y then the month to month change is only .391%. This would be too low. Even without doing real surveys, you can tell the month to month change is going to be much higher than before because you can see prices accelerating all around you.\n\nThat's anecdotal but my proof is in energy prices. If you look at last month's cpi report energy prices were actually lower because we had omicron significantly bring down energy prices. Look at any graph of oil / natural gas futures and you can see the month of December was lower than November which was a total anomaly completely due to omicron causing a mini crash in all markets. That means the last inflation report *should* have been even higher but energy prices actually brought it down. \n\nAs we all know energy prices sharply recovered in January to almost record levels but this means the January report is going to have 2 months worth of energy inflation baked into one. Energy is a big component of the cpi figure so I think the y/y change is going to be at least 7.3 but more likely 7.4%.\n\nI also don't really think the market is pricing this in. Money has moving in as we hit a lot of oversold indicators but with inflation this high, I think 4 rate hikes is guaranteed. There is most definitely a disconnect in the markets right now because the fed funds futures market is absolutely pricing in 4 rate hikes which means the 2% that we have on the 10 year yield is very valid. However stocks are most definitely not being priced according to the 2% 10 year yield. \n\nIf you look at historical SP 500 multiples, when the 10 yr is at 2% the multiple is at 20x. We are currently at 23-24x. That means that historically, we are overvalued by \\~15%. There has been earnings growth as we can see from the earnings season so far but multiple compression is just such a bigger component of prices. I think when this inflation number comes in plus the fed minutes next week, the repricing of assets that we had in January will continue. \n\nI think it's far more likely that we quickly drop to 'regular' p/e ratios rather than coast at the same price for a year or two while earnings catch up.", "score": 505, "replies": [{"body": "Great post.

{"title": "SONO will go down after earnings tonight — $10k in Puts", "selftext": "SONO reports holiday earnings tonight. They will be reporting “Q1 2022” earnings but it will be for the period ending December 31st 2021 so don’t get confused—They are reporting Christmas sales for 2021 but it’s reported as “Q1 2022.” This quarter is always their biggest quarter every year by far. \n\nSince IPO, SONO has posted roughly 9% annual growth. However, they just posted 30% annual growth from $1.326 billion in 2020 to $1.717 billion in 2021. That is a big jump… Clearly COVID boosted their holiday and general sales from the stay-at-home effect. \n\nManagement knows this boost in demand was brought on by COVID, and so do analysts. However, both management and analysts keep reiterating that this boost in sales from COVID is here to stay and the company will continue to grow. In the words of a Morgan Stanley analyst: \n\n*”Sonos undoubtedly benefitted from secular tailwinds brought about by COVID, however we wouldn’t characterize recent growth as “pull forward” as much as an acceleration of trends”*\n\n[Morgan Stanley ANALysis](https://imgur.com/1nEJcU2)\n\nThis is coming from Morgan Stanley, 5th largest shareholder of SONO, and if we exclude BlackRock and Vanguard, their 3rd largest shareholder. So take their ANALysis with a heavy pinch of salt. They are here to sell you designer SONO bags. And so is management. \n\nManagement has given an aggressive guidance of 12-16% growth for 2022. Now remember, every fiscal year for SONO kicks off with holiday sales. For fiscal year 2021, they kicked off holiday sales in 2020 with $646 million in revenue—a record quarter. This quarter is huge for this company. It sets the tone for the rest of the year. \n\nHowever, this year they guided lower for holiday sales due to supply chain issues, yet, they continue to pound the table that there is huge demand and guide higher overall. They’re telling us they will earn record revenue numbers for 2022 with around 12-16% increase, while guiding lower on their busiest quarter? Really? Something stinks…\n\nCan we see softened demand over the holidays? Absolutely. And it’s not pretty. \n\nWe can check 2 places. Google trends for the terms: **SONOS Speaker, SONOS, and Speaker,** shows huge spikes in these searches for the past 5 years around Christmas time like clockwork. This year? The spike is muted big time. See spike 5:\n\n[Google Trends shows extremely muted spike for Christmas this year](https://imgur.com/fq4dZHx)\n\nAnd to confirm this, we can look at Best Buy Q3 earnings and holiday season outlook. SONO’s depends on channel partners for the vast majority of its sales… Best Buy is SONO’s largest retailer and accounts for 14% of total revenue according to SONO 10k form. So when Best Buy speaks, you best listen. \n\n[SONO 10k](https://imgur.com/Bmkb4BK)\n\nHere is Best Buy CFO on their Q3 2021 earnings call:  \n\n*”I would say some sales probably got pulled into October similar to last year as a lot of the narrative in the media and supply chain constraints worried consumers…As we talked about last year, we saw strong results in October. The sales moderated, and they started to pick back up in January… we’re starting November flattish sales”*\n\n[Best Buy Q3 2021 Earnings Transcript](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/11/23/best-buy-bby-q3-2022-earnings-call-transcript/)\n\nBest Buy guided a weak holiday season and the stock reacted with -15% haircut overnight. \n\nSo Demand is down across the board this holiday season for electronics IN GENERAL as consumers bought gifts much earlier in the year due to the media ramming supply chain issues down consumers throats and fears of shortages. Demand is also down in general as COVID lockdowns start easing—less people are sitting inside and wanting to up their theatre systems, computers, speakers, etc. \n\nHowever, management at SONO tells us there is no demand issue whatsoever, that they will continue to grow, even with a decrease YOY in holiday sales—their biggest fucking quarter. WTF!\n\nI call bullshit. \n\n**The play:**\n\nDo not buy 2/11 or 2/18 puts. IV is way too high for these expirations and some negativity is baked into the stock meaning you need a big miss and removal of guidance for a big drawdown (I think this is possible but why take the chance on these options?)\n\n**My position: $10k on 3/18 25p’s**\n\nIV is low. Spread isn’t outrageous you can get a mid fill. Minor movement down in stock price will still give good gains 20-50% whereas the February puts will be toast without a big drawdown. \n\nIf we get a big drawdown these will still hit multiple times. \n\nIf no movement we can get out with our money back versus February options you are done. \n\nI am confident stock will slip after ER—by how much I’m not sure. So go further to March to prevent IV crush. \n\n[Position Screenshot](https://imgur.com/aKVBCXW) \n\n**TL;DR: SONO will show weak holiday demand and might even adjust their guidance lower. Stock will tank tonight**\n\n*Disclaimer: not financial advice, do your own research, I eat crayons", "id": "som108", "created_utc": 1644435763.0, "score": 60, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 176, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|55|**First Seen In WSB**|4 years ago\n**Total Comments**|69|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/som108/sono_will_go_down_after_earnings_tonight_10k_in/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l37ccg/bb_weekend_due_diligence_confirmation_bias/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l37h18/bb_weekend_due_diligence_confirmation_bias/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l37ktg/bb_weekend_due_diligence_confirmation_bias/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kibjkc/bb_insider_trading_unusual_options_activity_on/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9mms6/bb_updated_dd_please_deleverage_hedge_or_take/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lrl4aa/amt_earnings_play_tmrow_cheap_options_priced_for/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/se630b/get_your_lottery_tickets_bb/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qvil6b/i_think_its_about_time_gme/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qvipqa/i_think_its_about_time_gme/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/akzgqd/short_tu/) \n**Account Age**|4 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=som108)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=som108)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "He shots he does not score….", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Broooooo that fuckin candle is burning your whole house down at this point i bet.", "score": 71, "replies": [{"body": "![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)", "score": 21, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "You poor stupid asshole.", "score": 53, "replies": [{"body": "He's got till 3/18?

The play is still on the table, since $DIS is pretty beaten down but the company is strong, and reopening is actually happening this time. Beautiful looking chart, price rebounding from the 200 week MA on a reversal candle, and there is confirmed trend reversal on the daily (it's now showing a higher high and higher low). Holding out my shares for a while, but god damn what a fucking entry.\n\ntl;dr analysts don't know shit, they got outplayed by a dumbass with Google search trends.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: HAHAHAHAA IT ACTUALLY WAS THE DISNEY+ SUBS THAT SURPASSED EXPECTATIONS, AS PER: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/disney-earnings-q4-2021-175844858.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/disney-earnings-q4-2021-175844858.html)\n\nYOU CAN'T MAKE THIS SHIT UP. 11.8M NEW SUBS VERSUS ESTIMATE 7M.
