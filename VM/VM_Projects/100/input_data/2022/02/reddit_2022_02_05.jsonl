{"title": "Amazon Prime's price increase will result in an increase of ~$4 billion in annual revenue for Amazon", "selftext": "Amazon Prime rates are going up for US Customers on Feb 18th. **What that means for Amazon's revenue generated from Prime memberships?**\n\nAmazon had \\~151.9M US Customers in 2021. And its projected to have \\~157.4M by end of 2022. The annual price increase: $119 > $139, will generate an additional $3.8B in revenue\n\n(151.9M @ $119 = $18.07B | 157.4M @ $139 = $21.87B)\n\nBut, only half (48%) of subscribers pay annually. 52% of Prime Subscribers in US who pay monthly (with relatively high loyalty - 97%), their rates are increasing from $12.99 to $14.99, resulting in the following numbers:\n\n(78.98M @ $12.99 = $12.31B | 81.85M @ $14.99 = $14.72B)\n\nAn increase of $2.41B in revenue from monthly members.\n\nAdjusting the annual numbers a bit. For the annual subscribers (48% of total US customer), the updated numbers look like this:\n\n(72.91M @ $119 = $8.67B | 75.55M @ $139 = $10.50B)\n\nWhich would result in an adjusted increase of $1.825B from annual subscribers.\n\nThus, Amazon will generate an additional $4.235B ($2.41B+$1.825B) in revenue as a result of this price increase.\n\nThe higher rates for monthly members, an increase of $24 per year, versus an increase $20 for annual members could see a migration of some monthly members to annual membership.\n\nAnd, maybe that is what Amazon is trying to accomplish here. Remains to be seen if higher monthly costs will cause monthly subscribers to churn or convert to annual subscribers\n\n**TLDR**: Same as title, the increase in Amazon Prime prices will result in an increase of \\~$4.235B in annual revenue for Amazon from Prime memberships.\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-prime-fee-rise-180-175155725.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-prime-fee-rise-180-175155725.html)\n\n[https://backlinko.com/amazon-prime-users](https://backlinko.com/amazon-prime-users)[https://reuters.com/business/media-telecom/amazon-hikes-prime-membership-fees-us-2022-02-03/](https://reuters.com/business/media-telecom/amazon-hikes-prime-membership-fees-us-2022-02-03/)", "id": "slh5fj", "created_utc": 1644096323.0, "score": 218, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 115, "comments": [{"body": "Or maybe subscribers, like myself, who have already seen what little good content there is, will be prompted to cancel membership", "score": 327, "replies": [{"body": "I just canceled mine, also my brother is going to cancel his in the coming weeks before renewing his account.", "score": 67, "replies": [{"body": "Just cancelled too!", "score": 41, "replies": [{"body": "About to cancel mine.", "score": 27, "replies": [{"body": "I am canceling for sure when renewal time comes.

{"title": "Am I the only one who thinks the market got FB and AMZN wrong?", "selftext": "If we delve into the earnings reports for both companies, almost 80% of Amazon's EPS came from it's stake in Rivian as of Dec 31 (which at this point is now much lower). They would have missed earnings without Rivian, and they missed revenue estimates (during a time of 7% inflation, that's actually pretty bad). In addition, their profit margins and FCF decreased. FCF was actually negative, to the tune of $-9 billion. \n\nLets compare that to Facebook/meta. Facebook's advertising income grew 20% YoY, and their VR segment grew by 22%. They beat revenue estimates but missed EPS by 4%. However, they only missed EPS because of a $3.3 billion loss in their VR segment. Without that loss, they would have easily beat EPS by over 20% as well as beating on revenues. Their FCF and profit margins also increased YoY. \n\nIf we compare guidance between the two they both reported disappointing guidance of only 2-8% growth in Q2. However, Facebook is valued at ~17 PE currently while Amazon has a PE of ~59. \n\nSo two companies with equal growth rates - however FB has increasing profits and FCF while Amazon has decreasing profits and FCF.\n\nThe only thing I can think that explains this is that the market is completely discounting FB's VR investment and not expecting any profits from this segment, ever. This makes no sense because their VR segment is already making over $2.2 billion in revenues per year (with an appstore that brings in high profit margins) while their losses in VR will slowly decrease as their research & development matures. \n\nIn contrast Amazon has a good AWS business that has 40% annual growth and good margins. However this is heavily offset by a generally low-profit to unprofitable retail business. I'm a little worried about this because other companies that have a high-margin platform/software business combined with a money-losing retail/hardware business (ROKU, PTON) have also been heavily overvalued in the past and fell sharply when they posted even a slight miss in ER. \n\nDisclaimer - I have positions in both FB and AMZN", "id": "skvnqm", "created_utc": 1644027918.0, "score": 246, "upvote_ratio": 0.77, "num_comments": 279, "comments": [{"body": "I think the same as you.

Whilst I entertain the debate of retail investor vs machine I prefer to be ruthlessly pragmatic.\n\n**This is what I use:**\n\n* Trading - Alpaca and [composer.trade](https://composer.trade/).\n* Market intelligence (Openinsider. com , Whale Wisdom, Fintel, EDGAR, S-1 Fillings, etc.)\n* Macro sentiment tracking (I use awario and Feedly. com to track and distill social media mentions for keywords, influencers, regulators, geopolitical info etc.) For a free version of this you can   use Google trends and a keyword tracking recipe [Zapier.com](https://Zapier.com).\n\n**Relocation:**\n\n* Relocation might be something most of you wouldn’t probably consider, however having no kids and working in a globally distributed team, etc, I find myself in a position where I could make this a reality.\n* I’ve been considering getting a second citizenship in either Montenegro, Georgia (Country), or Jamaica (CIP terms to be announced at some point this year).\n\n**That is it ladies and gents.**\n\nYour turn.

{"title": "Facebook, you either hate it or...hate it", "selftext": "I always knew that the average investor was too lazy to question the truthfulness (or accuracy) of the information available out there and run a quality check but the recent debate on Facebook made me realize that the average investor is even lazier than I thought.\n\nIn the last few days I read so many posts and comments about the Apple's privacy changes and their impact on revenue of Facebook. For many, the best days of Facebook are behind the company.\n\nIt's interesting how this issue comes up almost exclusively in discussions about Facebook, when among all companies that generate revenue from online ads (hey there, Google), it is the best positioned one in order to handle this change. Why? Because the feature **requires app developers to ask for permissions before they track people's activity across apps or websites they don’t own in order to target advertising to them** and Facebook, given the nature of its business, **still has access to an enormous amount of high quality data**.\n\nIt's obvious that Apple's feature does not allow Facebook to harvest data as effectively as it did before, but you know, you can deny Facebook permission to track your data across apps or websites it doesn’t own as much as you want but if you then log in on Facebook (or Instagram, for that matter) to write a post about how good the Big Mac that you had for lunch was, you're still providing Facebook with a mountain of valuable data.\n\nBefore Apple launched its new App Tracking Transparency feature in iOS 14.5, Facebook had complete control of its game. What about now that this feature is available then? Apple global smartphone market Share is about 30%. Of that 30%, 86% of iOS devices are running a recent enough version of the software to be presented with ATT prompts, according to an October report from AppsFlyer. Of the people who see the pop-up, **38% are still opting-in**, and 62% are opting-out. Being 100% the global smartphone market share, **only about 16% is using the feature**. Yep, the days of Facebook are definitely numbered.\n\nOne of the posts that really stuck with me was the one arguing that now it's just about iOS devices but pretty soon also Android will follow suit. What makes you think that Alphabet, whose revenue is mainly derived from online ads, is rushing to provide Android users with the chance to \"opt-out\" if they don't want apps and websites to track their data?\n\nAlso, to all those people who hate Facebook so much that can't help but write about how much they hate Facebook on every other social media (which, by the way, do exactly the same thing that Facebook does, just on a smaller scale), don't you find it a little hypocrite to hate that much Facebook for doing what it does with your data but have nothing to say on the companies (and I guess that only few would not make it in this list) that exploit those data to aggressively push for their products (hey there, Apple)?\n\nIn all fairness, Facebook is nothing but a scapegoat, the real issue is the society in which we live.", "id": "slgzux", "created_utc": 1644095923.0, "score": 985, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 333, "comments": [{"body": "I run Facebook, Google, and Microsoft ads for my small business.

If we take a step back and understand the system, we know that it is mostly a NN-based perception stack with a C++ heuristic planner. It is also likely they are spending more time working on the perception part still. Most of their discussion is around perception. This means that most of the changes to behaviour we see are likely from changes to the perception stack. It has been my understanding that they are mostly still working on 3D positioning accuracy over time.\n\nMost of the disengagements were where Chuck thought the car didn't have enough time to complete the manoeuvre. There was one on the right turn, and maybe 2-3 on the left turn. If FSD can see the oncoming car, and has high certainty of its trajectory and speed (one car on the road, and going straight on a highway), why would a heuristic planner drive right in front of it? This doesn't make any sense. The heuristic planner would have a very strong core framework to prevent collisions.\n\nIt seems to me that the more likely reason is that Tesla turned up the aggressiveness in 10.10 because the 3D perception stack is more accurate, and combined with the minimal traffic made some manoeuvre's that Chuck wasn't comfortable with, even though they were 'safe'. If the road was 'busy' and it was doing the same thing, I would agree that there was more of a regression.

This would remove all of the perception failures from your 'is the human right' dataset. \n\nThen you are left with the computer had X trajectory but the human cancelled it. Would that trajectory have been safe? I think in most circumstances this should be quite easy to model. You know what the car is capable of in terms of manoeuvring. You also know the 3D model of the world. You also know (mostly) what all the other cars did (this won't cover situations where your actions materially affected other road users' behaviour). If you assume that FSD's failed manoeuvre didn't affect the other car's trajectories, then you can basically just run the scene in a simulation, and see if the FSD's planned trajectory would be safe. \n\nThe complexity I think would lie in the situations of interaction where it's unclear what the cars would have done if you didn't attempt to interact with them at that moment.

It's because people got a bunch of free money and spent it and now it's gone.\n\n- supply chain resolves, flooding the market with an oversupply of goods when demand is waning. Companies suffer so stocks suffer and employment suffers. \n\n- the correction to the hyperinflation becomes an overcorrection leading us into a rapid recession\n\n- the Fed changes the rate, frequency or amounts of rate hikes and balance sheet tapers (Powell said they didn't know what they were going to do for sure when asked about a possible .5% rake hike and another Fed rep said it was entirely possible last week).\n\n- yield curve inverts\n\n- inflation continues to climb and wages continue to climb, creating a feedback loop that creates the most insane inflation you've ever seen\n\n- several large or mega cap companies fail in the market just like Netflix and FB did. This drags all index funds down because those companies are overweighted in the indexes. Passive investors freak out and sell their shit (which happened at record amounts in Jan already)\n\n- Bitcoin crashes or gets all fucked up from the controls the U.S. government is currently deciding on implementing asap\n\n- everyone finally sees how fucked up China's real estate market and stock market has become and it crashes the global market (same as what happened here in '08 - real estate market crashed here and took down every stock market in the world).\n\n- U.S. housing market crashes (it's beyond inflated and projections just came out saying that it may \"soften\" which is what they say before a crash)\n\n- energy prices continue to rise, cutting into the profitability of every company and causing people to have less disposable income causing a recession\n\n- the record high leverage in the stock market comes out of the market via margin calls and because people are broke with inflation then recession.

The dot.com crisis was due to the frenzy into tech fueled by venture capital companies that were financing startups by anyone of Indian descent who graduated from Carnegie Mellon University and their counterparts.  Unfortunately, not everyone well versed in computer science is capable of both inventing a technology and executing a viable business plan.  It was a sector bubble.  And sector bubbles always burst.  They don't crash the entire market and have a limited, albeit negative effect on the economy.  The banking crisis was precipitated by Bush signing the Community Reinvestment Act into law, leading to no doc loans and helocs at 125% of equity.  Banks need 2% to cover their costs and Reserve Requirements, so they can lend out the rest.  Many people opted for adjustable rate mortgages and were unable to make the payments when the adjustable rates rose.  Most probably couldn't qualify for fixed rate mortgages at the time.  Citibank and Merrill Lynch were failing due to foreclosures.  Bank of America bought Merrill Lynch and was failing only because of the purchase of Merrill Lynch. The other 3 big banks had solid balance sheets and were not in danger of collapse.  However, since a run on Citibank and B of A would have plunged the country into a depression, Barney Frank called the CEO's of the 5 major institutions and negotiated them accepting the blame in exchange for Tarp money.  The government reneged, and the banks repaid the Tarp money in advance.  Bernanke then chose to model the zero rate environment after Japan, which everyone knows was a dismal failure for Japan and for the US. This failed monetary policy led to zero long term rates, effectively forcing everyone into the market.  This, along with an increasing influx of money from 401K, Roths, IRA, and 403B made for a stellar bull market over the long term and unprecedented in history.  Nobody wanted a correction on their watch.  Then came Covid and the vast, unsustainable money printing problem which has led to an astronomical and untenable deficit.  To raise interest rates would mean the US government would be responsible for paying the debt service on the deficit, which it cannot do with the current tax revenue.  The only way to reduce this staggering debt would be to devalue the dollar.  That's done by increasing inflation and making the dollar worth less.  Now, do you have enough info for you term paper?
