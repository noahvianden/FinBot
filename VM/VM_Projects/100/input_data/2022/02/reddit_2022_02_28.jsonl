If it stays at a similar share price, that contract will be worth less each day(thus making you a profit).  A professional trader will buy back that contract on Tuesday or  Wednesday for $1,700 or $1,200  - making  $600 - $1,100 profit. \n\nThen sell another contract and repeat.  \n\nAgain, the number 1 rule - DO NOT let your shares get exercised and ideally, don't own the same contract anywhere close to expiry.   \n\n\nFurther example, based on the scenario above.  You sell a contract brining in $2,300 premium.  on Wednesday the share price has increased to $814. You now but back that contract ... given the time decay, it may only cost you $2,400-$2,500 ( could be slightly more)  Then immediately sell a $820 for the following Friday bringing in $2,500.

A covered call locks those shares up in the contract until expiration or when you buy the contract back. So if you write a 30 day contract at $12 and the next day SOFI rockets to $20, there's not a thing you can do about it. The shares locked up in the contract are not yours to trade.

The #1 advisory at the top of this thread is to simply sell your long option instead of exercising it. You make more money this way.\n\n>$6350 / 100 shares = $63.5 per share of TQQQ ... this is my break even point meaning any time between now and 1/19/24, if TQQQ is above $63.5, I am making money if I exercise the option, get my 100 shares of TQQQ, and immediately sell back those 100 TQQQ shares at that price ($63.5).\n\nThat is true, if you exercise, which you should not do.  If you exercise and then immediately sell the shares, you only get the intrinsic value of the option, that is, the difference between the strike price and underlying spot price.  But the option is worth more than that.  It has extrinsic value on top of its intrinsic value.\n\nIf you're just selling the option, TQQQ doesn't have to be at 63.5 for you to make money.  The option can increase in value because of an increase in TQQQ, or an increase in volatility, and you can sell the option for a profit.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "> If you're just selling the option, TQQQ doesn't have to be at 63.5 for you to make money.

Suppose we have 10GW of renewables installed on this grid as well. Its a nice sunny day and the renewables are generating their full 10GW at 1pm. This means the country only needs an additional 5GW of electricity! Your base load was just cut into half thanks to the renewables. So if you want nuclear to do base load, you can only have 5GW of it. Any more and you'd have to shut down the reactor during the day, which is terrible for nuclear reactors. And this gets worse the more renewables you install. If the country installs 20GW of renewables instead, there won't be any baseload at all.

Solar panels can be disconnected/reconnected as needed.\n\nYou could do this yes, but not without nationalizing the entire grid and changing the entire way it works. Right now, the way the grid works is that the price of electricity dictates what sources come online. So at 5 cent per kwh the coal power plants come online. At 10 cents the nuclear power plants and at 20 cents the gas peaker plants for example. The grid operator keeps raising/lowering prices until the demand is exactly balanced with the production. The reason different powerplants come online at different price points is due to their varying operating costs, with the low operating cost powerplants coming online first.\n\nSo how does this work on a grid with nuclear and renewables? Well, renewables don't burn any fuel and are literally free energy. Their price point hovers around 0 cents per kwh. This means that unless the price of electricity goes negative, they will always want to deliver to the grid. A nuclear power plant has a low operating cost, but it can't compete with free. So yes, you can disconnect the wind and solar etc to keep the nuclear power plant chugging.

But during the 1930s, the U.S. government and the media began spreading outrageous lies about marijuana, which led to its prohibition. Some headlines made about marijuana in the 1930s were: \"Marijuana: The assassin of youth.\" \"Marijuana: The devil's weed with roots in hell.\" \"Marijuana makes fiends of boys in 30 days.\" \"If the hideous monster Frankenstein came face to face with the monster marijuana, he would drop dead of fright.\" In 1936, the liquor industry funded the infamous movie titled Reefer Madness. This movie depicts a man going insane from smoking marijuana, and then killing his entire family with an ax. This campaign of lies, as well as other evidence, have led many to believe there may have been a hidden agenda behind Marijuana Prohibition.\n\nShortly before marijuana was banned by The Marijuana Tax Act of 1937, new technologies were developed that made hemp a potential competitor with the newly-founded synthetic fiber and plastics industries. Hemp's potential for producing paper also posed a threat to the timber industry (see New Billion-Dollar Crop). Evidence suggests that commercial interests having much to lose from hemp competition helped propagate reefer madness hysteria, and used their influence to lobby for Marijuana Prohibition. It is not known for certain if special interests conspired to destroy the hemp industry via Marijuana Prohibition, but enough evidence exists to raise the possibility.\n\nAfter Alcohol Prohibition ended in 1933, funding for the Federal Bureau of Narcotics (now the Drug Enforcement Administration) was reduced. The FBN's own director, Harry J. Anslinger, then became a leading advocate of Marijuana Prohibition. In 1937 Anslinger testified before Congress in favor of Marijuana Prohibition by saying: \"Marijuana is the most violence causing drug in the history of mankind.\" \"Most marijuana smokers are Negroes, Hispanics, Filipinos and entertainers. Their Satanic music, jazz and swing, result from marijuana usage. This marijuana causes white women to seek sexual relations with Negroes.\" Marijuana Prohibition is founded on lies and rooted in racism, prejudice, and ignorance. Just as politicians believed Harry J. Anslinger to be a marijuana expert in 1937, many people still believe law enforcement officials are marijuana experts. In reality, law enforcement officials have no expert knowledge of marijuana's medical or health effects, but they do represent an industry that receives billions of tax dollars to enforce Marijuana Prohibition.\n\nBefore the government began promoting reefer madness hysteria during the 1930s, the word marijuana was a Mexican word that was totally absent from the American vocabulary. In the 1930s, Americans knew that hemp was a common, useful, and harmless crop. It is extremely unlikely anyone would have believed hemp was dangerous, or would have believed stories of hemp madness. Thus, the words marijuana and reefer were substituted for the word hemp in order to frighten the public into supporting Hemp Prohibition. Very few people realized that marijuana and hemp came from the same plant species; thus, virtually nobody knew that Marijuana Prohibition would destroy the hemp industry.\n\nBolstering the theory that marijuana was banned to destroy the hemp industry, two articles were written on the eve of Marijuana Prohibition that claim hemp was on the verge of becoming a super crop. These articles appeared in two well-respected magazines that are still published today. The articles are:\n\nFlax and Hemp (Mechanical Engineering, Feb. 1937)\nNew Billion-Dollar Crop (Popular Mechanics, Feb. 1938)\n\nThis was the first time that billion dollar was used to describe the value of a crop. These articles praise the usefulness and potential of hemp by stating \"hemp can be used to produce more than 25,000 products\" and \"hemp will prove, for both farmer and public, the most profitable and desirable crop that can be grown.\" Marijuana Prohibition took effect within one year after both these articles were written.", "score": 4, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "ty", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "henry ford built a car body out of hemp based plastics in the early 1900's, its body panels were extremely durable and didnt dent easily, like a saturn. \n\nhttps://th.bing.com/th/id/R.f3b8b0f574f9cfc9e8ffaf16dd93e51a?rik=mbQ2HC%2fNlk8o5Q&riu=http%3a%2f%2fhempvictorygarden.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2017%2f01%2fHenry-Fords-1941-Car.jpg&ehk=a64aapt5vC0yHPjMDJNUnsVBDruKmz%2foqx5yc%2bOusdU%3d&risl=&pid=ImgRaw&r=0", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "I don't trust anyone with bing links", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anyauto.com.au%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F03%2FFord-Hemp-Car.jpg&imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anyauto.com.au%2Fhenry-ford-built-a-hemp-car-that-ran-on-hemp-fuel-80-years-ago%2F&tbnid=6SszF0FwCYGTzM&vet=12ahUKEwiF4P6C9KL2AhXFIzQIHSJ6A2UQMygBegUIARCaAQ..i&docid=HfRqNYxsdumMRM&w=1200&h=800&q=ford%20hemp%20car&ved=2ahUKEwiF4P6C9KL2AhXFIzQIHSJ6A2UQMygBegUIARCaAQ", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "i thought that plastic saturn body panels were notorious for cracking and becoming misshapen", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "we hit saturns with so many with soccer and basket balls back in the day.   only high heat and extreme cold made the body panels susceptible to outside influences.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Except you want cars to dent in certain spots, or else the passengers are not going to have a great time.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "that would be a crumple zome my man, they didnt have that shit in the 40's.  this is for cosmetic dents, soccer balls, baseballs, not crashes with other 3 ton 1/8\" steel bodied cars.  think before you speak.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Yes I know it‚Äôs called a crumple zone, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm saying that you want to have them, and the fact that Ford made a car out of hemp in the 50s/60s doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs a viable material for car manufacturing today.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "they didnt know what they were back then so it was of no concern then.  its absolutely viable since we've seen steel framed cars, with crumple zones, like a fucking saturns, we could build metal space frames with all the cool technology and crumple zones and wrap that in a hemp plastic shell.  i dont get why this is so hard for you to wrap your head around.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Once again, I‚Äôm aware of the safety standards in the 1950s, but you obviously have a serious reading comprehension if you can‚Äôt see the point I‚Äôm getting to.\n\nAlso, if you want to pay out of your ass for cars we could definitely produce them the way you‚Äôre proposing.

Sure, if you ground the marbles up into a powder then injected them into the ground water you would create all sorts of problems, but your marbles aren't in the open, they're encased in steel caskets and feet of reinforced concrete. \n\nNow take these marbles that are surrounded by feet of concrete and steel then store them in a rock mountain miles below the ground and thousands of feet above the water table. ***BUT WHAT IF THE MARBLES SOMEHOW GET INTO THE WATER TABLE?*** \n\n-_-\n\n\nThe fact is soluble byproducts of all sorts of manufacturing in the world are far more deadly and a risk to our safety and environment than transuranic high level wastes. Heavy lead from mining can last hundreds of thousands of years and cause all sort of health problems, but you never see the same level of concern with it that nuclear byproducts get.\n\nReprocessing is the other huge elephant in the room that people either don't known about or don't understand. The fact is because of reprocessing methods you can take high level transuranic waste and convert it into another type of material that can be re-used for power once again, and it's final form is a lower level waste. France has been practicing this recycling of high level waste for nearly 50 years with great success, but the US has failed to adopt this stance because it's expensive and we like money, we also have a shit ton of space to store these dry caskets of high level waste.\n\nFissile Nuclear power isn't prefect, but it's easily the best alternative power source we have if we want to be serious about preventing climate change.\n\n*If anyone would like to learn more about nuclear power, nuclear waste, coal power, or fission power I highly recommend the Illinois Energy Professors channel on youtube, he makes amazing content that anyone can understand!*\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnxksKmJa6U", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "Ths problem is that putting the waste in the air hasn't been a good solution either.

This history has motivated Germany to start plans to move away from nuclear energy as early as the 90s. However, their nuclear phaseout following Fukushima is not out of line with most countries globally. Simply put, cost to replace aging plants with new ones, or to upgrade old plants in order to extend lifetime and fix \"blindspots\" of the sort which caused Fukushima is too high compared to renewables. As a result, Germany's oldest reactors were shut down very quickly. Some of these reactors had many issues. The decision is political, of course. But not without strong merits. Krummel, for example, had short circuit problems leading to fires in 2007 and 2009. It was already offline at the time of Fukushima and still awaiting repairs and clearance to return to operation. In other cases (Isar-I, Isar-II, Phillipsburg-I, Phillipsburg-II) the accelerated timetable wound up identical to the original end-of-operation plan.\n\nSpeaking generally, to maintain Germany's pre-2011 levels of nuclear production they would have to have invested heavily in new plants. It was not a matter of just keeping things open for (relatively) low cost. Germany instead decided to stake their future on renewables. That decision, so far, is looking incredibly prescient. Only on reddit is one of the most successful renewable energy campaigns seen as a failure. In the intervening decade renewables have dropped in cost by a huge factor (\\~10x for solar, \\~3x for wind).

Millions of households are to receive more compensation for solar roof systems.\nBy Stefan Schultz\n02/28/2022, 10:32 am\n\nThe traffic light coalition is pushing ahead in the expansion of renewable energies. \"With many measures, we will achieve a 100 percent electricity supply with renewable energies as early as 2035,\" wrote Oliver Krischer, Parliamentary State Secretary in the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate on Twitter on Sunday evening. \"This not only benefits climate protection, but also makes us independent of Putin's gas, oil and coal.\"\n\nIn the environment of the ministry, it is said to SPIEGEL that an amendment to the Renewable Energy Act (EEG) with initial goals and measures for accelerated expansion has been completed and went into coordination with other ministries last Friday. Until now, full coverage was not planned until 2050 at the latest. Initially, the S√ºddeutsche Zeitung had reported this.\n\nThe expansion of the corresponding plants is to be significantly accelerated. Wind turbines with a capacity of 100 to 110 gigawatts are to rotate on land by 2030, 30 gigawatts of power are planned at sea, according to a cornerstone paper on the law, which is available to SPIEGEL. In addition, there are solar systems with an output of 200 gigawatts, about four times the current stock. These targets were already in the coalition agreement.\n\nIn addition to pure goals, the ministry is already planning the first concrete measures to advance the expansion:\n\nAccording to ministry circles, the funding rates for solar systems on private roofs are to increase overall.\nThe controversial \"breathing lid\", which lowered the support the more the market boomed, should be abolished.\nAs announced, solar systems on fields will soon receive funding. The plan is that planting continues under the modules and that the plants provide shade for the plants.\nCitizen projects for wind or solar parks are to be partially excluded from tenders in which project developers struggle to build green electricity plants at the lowest possible funding rate.\nAs announced in mid-February, the areas that the federal states must identify for solar systems will be increased by about nine percent.\nThe federal government will also gradually enter into so-called contracts for differences, according to SPIEGEL in the ministry. Similar to the EEG, a minimum proceeds for each kilowatt hour are guaranteed here. If, on the other hand, electricity prices rise sharply, operators must reimburse revenues beyond an upper limit. First, this is sought for solar open space systems, it is said. Later also for offshore wind turbines.\n\nThis is intended to stop the price usury in the green electricity sector. Consumers have been promoting the construction of green electricity plants for years by discounts on their electricity bill. In the current energy crisis, plant operators are doing the business of their lives - at the expense of customers.\n\nHowever, a simplification of the so-called repowering of wind power locations on land did not make it into the present draft of the ministry - although the wind associations had pushed for it in particular. Repowering replaces older smaller wind turbines at the same location with larger more powerful ones. According to the association, this could drastically accelerate the energy transition. The ministry states that they would have liked faster implementation at this point, but could not anticipate the necessary changes to construction law. And these were still running.\n\nIn the renewable energy associations, Krischer's push caused some irritation. The EEG amendment has so far been for the 7th. March, it says to SPIEGEL. A technical discussion with ministerials and dozens of association representatives is still planned for this Thursday. Now you can find out the details of the law in advance from the newspaper. \"What's that all about?\" asks a representative of the association.\n\nHowever, as announced, the green electricity surcharge for electricity consumers will be on the 1st. July abolished. The corresponding draft law, which is available to SPIEGEL, requires energy suppliers to pass on the savings completely to consumers. Simultaneous price adjustments for another reason are not permitted under the law.

They also allow arms and hands to be used as normal freely without bulky sleeves getting in the way - so fine for indoors and working ,with no sweaty pits (and it's a body drying heat too).\n\nBest of all: at 0.1813 Euros per kilowatt-hour to recharge: (even with 80% efficiency) my x6 powerbanks (0.6 kwh) cost only 0.13 Euros per day - replacing my heating costs before of 2.35 Euros a day (or about x18 less) - saving 2.22 Euros \n\nI spent less than 200 Euros investment which returned in savings after only 90 days first few months use.\nSwiched my supplier to renewable sourced and happy to suck up the extra costs - still paying way less over all, never cold and can sleep a little better at night not buying anywhere near as much fossel fuels.\nHarm reduction works.\n\n(1) https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-20339-9_3", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Also especially if you live in an Altbau - it's important to make sure your building skin is actually well insulated.

Adding positions or actionable advice makes posts that much better. \n\nHowever, requiring them makes the sub feel like a 24/7 infomercial.\n\nAnd that's because a much better heuristic of post value is the quality of the discussion in the body or comments.\n\nIt's entirely fair to do a bunch of research, or post some market moving news, but not find an investable idea yourself. That has value, and if you do the groundwork, users will chime in and find a way to make money off the situation.\n\nFinally, a quick word on politics.\n\nIt's really hard to separate politics from markets, they are fundamentally intertwined. In volatile situations like right now, that line becomes even more blurred.\n\nIt certainly doesn't help that the whole world has become military strategy experts overnight.\n\nA priori we have no idea whether a thread will produce quality discussion, or end up like r/politics.
