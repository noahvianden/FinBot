{"title": "The coming crash isn't what you think. It's already here.", "selftext": "Going full ADHD on this so bare with me.\n\nThe market is going to separate the wheat from the chaff when it comes to tech/growth plays.  The tech bubble didn't kill tech, it purged the weak and rewarded the strong.  \n\nAny debt laden companies will be on the chopping block as the only option for them will be higher interest borrowing or share dilution.  Plays like Amazon/Google/Apple/MS will also experience volatility but at the end of the day they can easily scale their pricing with inflation.  In fact one could argue these companies will do better in a high but steady inflationary landscape.    Pricing can be changed instantly and capital expenditures such as infrastructure (renewable power generation, servers, etc) will seem relatively cheap. \n\nThink of it this way... if we experience 15% inflation for the next 3 years that compounds to a 52% increase in the price of goods.    A stock would have to increase in price by 52% to break-even in terms of relative value/buying power.  \n\nThat said a crash can go two ways.... \n\n1) Traditional low inflation 80% great depression type crash.\n\n2) 3+ year high inflationary period where stocks run flat due to interest rates trying to supress the snowballing inflation.  Don't count on 15%+ interest this time around.  The US would immediately default.  The Fed will likely begin increasing rates too tepidly which will further push the pain  down the road.\n\nI'd argue the 2nd crash is much worse and is almost certain at this point.  It reflects a lack of faith in monetary policy/control and a permanent loss of wealth for the nation.  Since decoupling the USD from gold the USD has steadily seen it's buying power eroded.\n\nWhen the market crashes it's not going to sell off entirely.  Crap meme stocks will be purged from existence and boomer companies like oil, infrastructure, renewable energy, REITS with equity financing, commercial reits and commodity plays will all rally to what will seem like astronomical heights.  It's already happening.  \n\n1)  Housing prices are going crazy everywhere.  Partially due to supply constraints and immigration but also due to input costs and people starting to panic.  They are starting to realize if they don't get into the market now they never will.  Buying an overpriced home now will seem cheap in 3-5 years when we start to hit big inflation numbers.   \n\n2)  Energy stocks up 20%+ in the last 3 months.  Wait until Russia screws with Ukraine and China pushes on Taiwan as the US is busy watching Russia.\n\n3)  Companies with cash are using their war chests to acquire companies.  Sony/Bungie.  Microsoft/Activision/Blizzard.  AMD/Xilinx.  Nvidia/ARM.  This is just the beginning.  It's costing these companies 10%+ of the buying power annually to keep cash. Shareholders will demand they use it or give it back in the form of  share buybacks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Stick with best of breed tech, buy the biggest house you can afford and lock in for as long as you can (or refinance and take out some of that new found equity and invest it into dividend plays to pay off your mortgage for you) and buy boomer stocks.", "id": "sk0o1n", "created_utc": 1643938637.0, "score": 1836, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 841, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|2|**First Seen In WSB**|10 months ago\n**Total Comments**|1|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|5 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=sk0o1n)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=sk0o1n)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I too believe all the markets will either go up, down, or sideways.

I have been trying to communicate this to so many but people believe that a 08-09 crash just is inevitable and that they will be able to buy whatever they want in the next year or two… I 100% could be wrong but just don’t see that. I think people that keep their mortgage will be just fine if they can handle the inflationary increase of everything else. Those that try to sell peak bought homes will be the ones in a possible mess. Especially ones that knowingly paid well more than appraisal value for their homes. I don’t understand the whole home price soaring due to inflation for the next 3-5 years. I could understand if we weren’t in a rate increase environment that this could have potential. If the price to build a home is going to inflate higher than normal (compared to last 10 years) and interest rates are going to increase to possibly levels higher seen in the last 10 years, I see new construction builds slowing tremendously. Which causes a whole lot of things to slow down, noticed I said slow down not crash. Also note I am not saying market… market and economy separate items. Market valuations I believe will crash, due to the 10 year raising which I would say the majority of investment returns is compared to.  The economy though however I believe will potentially chug along. I think the Fed is going to keep it calm or attempt to. No great upside and no great downside, just hold it…. And I mean for a while… over a span of years of basically nothing. Valuations I think will be the best place to make high return investments due to the valuation adjustment and then the fear of loss of return driving a sell off. Also note, the market is not what is was in the past decade. They control sell offs and will shut the market down to cool it off (implemented post ‘08 crash). The fed can also feather rates to gradually control the sell off. No crystal ball for me here but I think we will see an attempt for stabilization over the next 3-5years. Balancing inflation but still balancing people not losing their ass in the market.

While increasing prices is nice, not being able to deliver product is extremely detrimental. Additionally if prices continue to rise many consumers will be priced out and supply lines may catch up too late. Cash will likely be used for these production improvements rather than buybacks or acquisitions. Growth is going to have a difficult time here when capital expansion is expensive.\n\nCompanies with the pricing power (advertising based revenue, consumer durables who’s supply is rather generic, essential business software, financials) will reap the greatest benefits as their suppliers have no choice. Companies like Nvidia, may be forced to plateau prices to keep demand high, as suppliers negotiate increased prices. This Nvidia for example will have its hand forced to expanding production lines.

We’ll have stagflation which is a death sentence for economies. Eventually prices will fall due to low demand and oversupply so some new equilibrium will be reached. So, no home prices or any other asset class can’t keep going up at the same rate unless peoples’ wages are matching/exceeding that rate. For example, the mortgage system has a built in limit. It won’t allow for people to borrow more then their DTI ratio. It’s why higher mortgage rates will lead to lower home prices just like higher rates lower valuations in equities. Homebuilders will feel the squeeze because their subs will still be demanding higher rates in the short term and customers will be demanding lower pricing due to affordability. Now, one could argue that’s the reason PE firms, like Blackcock, are buying up starter homes in the hopes of renting them out because they’re not subject to the same DTI limit and aren’t worried payback period (similar to REITs). This would effectively create a barrier to entry for any non-homeowners. But once things stabilize and subs stop demanding as high of prices due to lower demand, homebuilders will begin building again and increase the supply of homes. Of course there will still be people effectively locked out of homeownership, but that is inevitable. I’m sure there will be some type of government intervention with the goal of 100% homeownership, like the Clinton mortgage policy (the beginnings of the housing crisis).\n\nI do agree that this next crash will purge the weak.

{"title": "Zuck's going to make me a millionaire", "selftext": "[https://imgur.com/a/hMrRqrj](https://imgur.com/a/hMrRqrj)\n\nBest asymmetric play in the market right now.\n\nReduction in users is problematic and the loss of revenue from AAPL's privacy changes introduces headwinds, but the rout that FB has taken these past two days  suggests that there will be no way to manage either of these two issues. Today's dump is a continuation from yesterday, largely based on the negative news articles about how yesterday's loss was the worst in financial history. Basically, FB's loss yesterday was overdone, and today's drop is hysteria.\n\nFB will not get to ATH over the next two weeks, but I do expect it will approach previous support levels (roughly $300). Even if it gets to the mid-zone between the two previous resistance zones ($275, between $300 support in 2021 and $255 support in 2020), then the 2/18 $245 call shown above will still yield a 5x.\n\nThe news cycle next week for FB will be \"FB mounts rally after facing worst daily loss in financial history\". It may only regain a third to a half of the $323 to $234 loss, but even this puts us at a share price of $265... which would be a 4x on the 2/18 $245 call.\n\nHonestly, I think this play is a 5 bagger in the next two weeks. A run back to $325 would make me $1,400,000.\n\nEDIT: After being down 30% and up 28% at various points through the day, I ended up flat.

No one wants to admit this but the real way you win in the markets is to give up on “being right”. Options are supposed to hedge your bets. Are you short? Buy calls in case you’re wrong. Are you long? Buy puts in case you’re wrong. Long stock but not expecting much growth for the next few months? Write calls to make income and hedge losses. Want to own stock but don’t like the price? Write puts to make income and hedge yourself from inflation/opportunity cost.\n\nOptions are part of a strategy of investing, and investing is a strategy of patience, timing, research, and 90% crystal ball/pray the company isn’t retarded.\n\nThat being said, save up some cash, buy some stock, and avoid options. But the worst thing you can do right now is get scared out of the market.\n\nAlso, get the fuck off robinhood. Not only do they sell your data and orders/cost basis info to prolific short sellers (citadel), they design the GUI so you overreact to everything.

I don't even know why I am buying this, other than that I smell blood in the air. I'm an ape with a very large risk tolerance, mixed with a bit of a gambling addiction.

I hope it isn't loss porn, but OP will deliver if that's the case. Everyone loves some loss porn. People were upset I waited until after close before posting my AMD position, so here's META before close.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThesis: Netflix saw a bounce from $360 to $460 the week following its faceplant. Meta just experienced the largest single day wipeout of shareholder value in history [0]. I suspect we will see a similar bounce with META, which will be my exit. I am going to exit these positions before their next ER, regardless of performance since I don't know much about FB or META. I am just blindly buying the fucking dip, with leverage.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[EDIT] A bit more info for a thesis for people joining late. Meta announced during it's ER that it has ~$38.8 BILLION of free capital sitting around that it has allocated for share buybacks. I guarantee [1] you that Zuck's ego is a little hurt by this drop. He will likely do everything in his power, including deploying some of this capital (especially at this cheaper price) to buyback shares, which will prop the price up.\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[0] https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/03/facebooks-232billion-drop-in-value-sets-all-time-record.html\n\n[1] There is no guarantee of anything happening. This is my opinion, and if you lose money by blindly following my position, you deserve it.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nYes, this is a different brokerage than my other yolo's. They are on Questtrade (AMD, Intel & Baba). I diversify where my capital is. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhy leaps?\n\nAs per my AMD yolo, I am buying quite a lot of time. I don't plan to hold these leaps until expiry, or, to be honest, even more than a few weeks. I am buying super far dated expiries to minimize the time decay I experience. This gives me cheap access to leverage (~5-6x) without having to worry too much about the options losing value over time. This is why I like using leaps, and most of my trades involve them. Typically, options lose ~1/3rd of their value with ~1/2 the time left to expiry. If I am only planning to hold for < 1 month, these will likely lose < 4-6% of their value due to time (guessing). For the leverage they offer, it's a worthwhile tradeoff for me.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/AHsLPpG", "id": "sknjc2", "created_utc": 1644006787.0, "score": 236, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 196, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|13|**First Seen In WSB**|4 months ago\n**Total Comments**|484|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|4 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=sknjc2)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=sknjc2)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Good luck retard hope you triple it", "score": 108, "replies": [{"body": "I'm exiting well before a triple ahaha.

In short, the antiquated cookie-based tracking will be going away and this is something that ad tech industry has known for a while. \n\nGoogle being the smart group that they are is actually driving innovation in this field by looking into technologies like FLOC to still drive marketing revenue and ad spend while better respecting the user and creating a more sustainable business model for the future.

Their entire ad stack is built on sharing platform (FB, Insta, Messenger, WhatApp) data and targeting those audiences via device ID directly in other apps. \n\n* If a user doesn't give the Facebook app access to their IDFA, they can't match that user in other apps using the Facebook Audience Network SDK, even if a user gives those apps permission. (Social app opt in rates are 1-2%, mobile gaming is 20-40% depending on subgenre) \n* If a user DOES opt in to share with FB/Insta/etc. they ALSO have to opt in to share with the other apps. For an advertising platform, it's effectively a double opt-in. \n\nAs an advertiser, you can still target device IDs where known, and you can also act like it's traditional TV and look at app demographics to target. Standard demo stuff. It's \"dumber\" than it was, and one side effect is the pendulum has swung from \"Wow this ad is so creepy I was just thinking about that!\" to \"I'm not a woman, why am I seeing a menopause medication ad?\" It is undoubtedly more privacy safe though.\n\nA few other players have been flagrantly flaunting Apple's rules about Fingerprinting, especially on the UA attribution side (because SKAdNetwork sucks) and in some cases using the IDFV to create user profiles to target and retarget. This works for more vertically integrated companies because they also have apps to get installed, and they essentially steal \"partner\" campaign data to optimize their own campaigns. If Apple ever actually does crack down on this, expect a couple of publicly traded companies to collapse very quickly. \n\nThe IDFV is useless to Meta because it's only good for their own apps. Someone like Zynga can have the same IDFV across multiple GAMES, but Meta already knows who you are because they require a sign-in to work, and any apps using the FAN SDK get a DIFFERENT IDFV from those apps, since they aren't owned by Meta, making the data useless for everything except frequency capping (which many don't even use it for that, which is why you get the same ad over and over and over again).\n\nApple's changes kinda sucked if you were an ad-supported app developer, but they weren't the end of the world.
