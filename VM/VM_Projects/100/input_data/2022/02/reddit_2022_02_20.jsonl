Prices have been fairly reasonable when you adjust for growth and interest rates. The problem is interest rates have been so low and now may need to raise so quickly it's quite possible this is just the start of a long, more severe bear market. If you just assume the 10y will be going to 1.5% then we would need the S&P500 to fall at least another 10%. And that's just 2.5%, were it to go to 3% you would be looking at 20-30%.\n\nThen you have to consider slowing growth and recession risk. Not only will interest rate increases require multiple contraction, but they raise the chances of an economic slowdown and perhaps even a recession. In a worst case scenario where earnings contract a drop 50-60% drop on the S&P500 wouldn't be crazy.\n\nAnd recession isn't the only risk here. Obviously we have the ongoing developments in Ukraine. While Russia invading Ukraine in itself probably wouldn't have much economic consequence there are lots of things that could happen in the way of supply-chain issues and sanctions that could hurt, especially within specific sectors of the economy.\n\nWhat really bothers me is how this has all been playing out though... I've never seen specific segments of the market get hit so hard while other stocks like AAPL are doing fine. With AAPL near ATHs there is no way the NASDAQ can recover. You would have to assume almost every stock apart from AAPL is going to bounce back. I don't see that happening. The alternative is that AAPL demands an even higher multiple but I don't see that happening either. My guess is that the safety trade is next to be hit and that will play out next month. First low-quality growth was hit last year, then high quality growth towards the end of last year, then various low-conviction names like FB and NFLX started to get taken out and that just leaves the high quality stocks like AAPL. I personally I think AAPL should be trading closer to 22 PE and if I'm right you're looking at a 20-25% drop for AAPL and the S&P500 would likely follow.\n\nI don't know what the bull case even is. During the COVID selloff my go to was that the FED would step in and that's what happened, but the FED can't step in now. In fact, they have no choice but to do exactly what the market doesn't want them to do and raise rates. In 2018 we saw far more severe drops in valuations and that was just from the FED reducing the balance sheet. This time they're likely to reduce the balance sheet and rapidly raise rates. And if the markets don't like it, they're not going to be able to do a U-turn like in 2018 unless financial conditions really deteriorate. And if that happens your stocks are likely to already be down 30%+.\n\nI'm not sure what number I am. There was no bubble, but inflation not being transitory has now completely changed the game so we probably need to go quite a bit lower. If we don't see signs of inflation peaking soon, or if it actually gets worse, it's going to be brutal. At that point the FED will probably have no choice but to shock the economy into recession to combat inflation.\n\nWould be keen to hear if anyone disagrees with me, or what the bull case is for a recovery.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Russian Sanctions would ease the global chip supply issue (taking a year or more off the supply chain and inflation related recovery) while likely increasing oil/gas prices and adding to short term inflation.  \n\nInflation being as it is was obvious even in 2020 to somewhat like me—you think the FED didn’t also know it?

There is currently a shortage of doctors in the vet industry. Due to rise in cost of vet school and poor income to debt ratio. This makes it harder for them to open their own practices. The mindset has shifted from being a practice owner to working for corporate entities.  . Mainly expansion is happening via corporate entities and private equity purchasing existing practices and expanding them to meet consumer demand. Why is this important …… \n\nIdexx main revenue stream is via selling in-house lab equipment for clinics and hospitals. Unless there’s is continued growth on the practice owner side i.e new practices opening I feel idexx’s sales will slow. You will have places upgrading equipment over the next few years but I think they will slow as the contracts are typically for 5 years. Also, 1 analyzer can support a hospital of five - ten doctors. In years past those doctors may have opened 5 clinics and separately purchased 5 analyzers….. additionally their margins on ref lab are shit compared to sales of diagnostic equipment. \n\n\n \nIn summary my concerns for idexx \n1) less new opening practices compared to prior years past will lead to reduced sales of in house hospital diagnostic equipment the majority of revenue comes from equipment sales thus over long term slowed growth. \n4) increased competition due to Acquisitions and redirected business to feed their own associates entities. Ie vca and ANTECH. \n\nThus, although a healthy company which will remain profitable and I don’t think they are going anywhere.

{"title": "Rocket is gonna crash", "selftext": "Rocket ($RKT) reports Q4 earnings Thursday, 2/24 after market close.\n\nThey are the largest mortgage originator in the country. And they are about to have a really bad year.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI expect earnings to miss. And Q1 guidance will be horrible. \n\n# Looking back at Q3\n\nFrom their press release:\n\n* 88.0B closed loan origination volume\n* 3.05% gain-on-sale margin (GOSM)\n* 49.6B retail with GOSM 4.47%\n* 37.7B partner with GOSM 0.78%\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Q4 2021 guidance\n\n* Closed loan volume of between $75 billion and $80 billion.\n* Gain on sale margins of 2.65% to 2.95%.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo they guided lower volume and lower margins. The lower volume is not surprising due to seasonal trends (I think every single lender projected lower Q4 volume).\n\nBut the lower margins are interesting. This is probably due to increasing competition for less volume, combined with increasing wholesale market share (with lower margins).\n\n# Mortgage servicing rights (MSR)\n\n* Unpaid principal balance at the end of Q3: $521 billion. These are becoming much more valuable with higher rates.\n* They haven’t been growing it as fast and aggressively as some competitors, but still it is an impressive amount. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Q1 guidance\n\nHere’s where it gets interesting. \n\nVolume is quite low across the industry. Refinances are down over 50% (see below).\n\nSo how much will this plummet in refi volume affect Rocket? They don’t release their purchase numbers, but let’s try to predict:\n\nUWMC estimates Rocket has 88% refi (source: UWMC November investor presentation available at [https://s26.q4cdn.com/976831745/files/doc\\_financials/2021/q3/UWM-Holdings-Corp-3Q21-Earnings-Presentation\\_Final.pdf](https://s26.q4cdn.com/976831745/files/doc_financials/2021/q3/UWM-Holdings-Corp-3Q21-Earnings-Presentation_Final.pdf) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nRocket had only 27% purchase in 2019, well before the huge refinance boom, as disclosed on their S1.\n\n [https://www.housingwire.com/articles/rocket-delivers-record-volume-in-q3-but-execs-are-tight-lipped-on-purchase-v-refi/](https://www.housingwire.com/articles/rocket-delivers-record-volume-in-q3-but-execs-are-tight-lipped-on-purchase-v-refi/) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn their Q3 earnings release, Rocket proclaimed “Q3 2021 represented Rocket Mortgage's strongest purchase closed loan volume in company history. Our purchase volume grew 70% over Q3 2020 levels.”\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTotal volume from Q3 2020 and Q3 2021 were nearly identical. Yet purchase volume increased 70%. \n\nTo give Rocket the benefit of the doubt, let’s assume they had 12% purchase in Q3 2020, before the 70% growth they cite, and a full year before UWMC estimated Rocket with 12% purchase mix. \n\n* Q3 2020: 89B\n* 53.5B retail\n* 29.6B partner\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**If 12%/88% ratio:**\n\n* 10.7B purchase in Q3 2020\n* Add 70% and you get 18.2B purchase in Q3 2021, now 21% purchase\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**If 15%/85% ratio:**\n\n* 13.35B purchase in Q3 2020\n* Add 70% and you get 22.7B purchase for Q3 2021, now 26% purchase\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Another issue for rocket in Q1: Rate lock problems\n\nMortgage rates are rising exponentially. A rate lock in January may be significantly lower rate than the rate at origination a few weeks later. Longer times to close could have a big impact in Q1. It’s likely we won’t see any effects of this until Q1 earnings though. \n\n# Other data to support this\n\nloanDepot ($LDI) projected Q1 volume to drop by 8%-30%, and a huge drop in gain-on-sale margins:\n\n[https://s27.q4cdn.com/834830848/files/doc\\_downloads/2022/01/LDI-Q421-Earnings-Call-Transcript.pdf](https://s27.q4cdn.com/834830848/files/doc_downloads/2022/01/LDI-Q421-Earnings-Call-Transcript.pdf)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow let’s look at the publicly available mortgage data (h/t u/lymondfc).\n\n**VA data:** [https://www.benefits.va.gov/HOMELOANS/Lender\\_Statistics.asp](https://www.benefits.va.gov/HOMELOANS/Lender_Statistics.asp)   \n\nALL\n\nTotal Loan Amount\n\n* 3rd Qtr: $103,822,920,824\n* 4th Qtr: $92,468,433,277 (10.9% decrease)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRocket\n\nTotal Loan Amount\n\n* 3rd Qtr: $7,319,511,113\n* 4th Qtr: $6,214,143,673 **(15.1% decrease)**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**FHA Data:** [https://www.hud.gov/program\\_offices/housing/rmra/oe/rpts/sfsnap/sfsnap](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/housing/rmra/oe/rpts/sfsnap/sfsnap) \n\nALL\n\nTotal Loan Amount\n\n* 3rd Qtr: $85,650,768,830\n* 4th Qtr: $75,879,038,007 **(**12.9% decrease)\n\nRocket\n\nTotal Loan Amount\n\n* 3rd Qtr: $6,479,459,993\n*  4th Qtr: $5,461,202,656 (**18.5% decrease)**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nVolume down 15.1% and 18.5% in both data points. Let’s take the average, down 16.8%.\n\nThat makes $72B volume, clearly missing guidance. \n\nYet **even if we assume high end of guidance, $80B Q4 volume, it's still a mess:**\n\n* 21% purchase: $16.8B\n* 79% refi: $63.2B\n\nUp to:\n\n* 25% purchase: $20B\n* 75% refi: $60B\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne month ago, when rates were even lower, MBA estimated a 50% drop in refinance volume from a year ago. Surely it's higher than 50% now. Mortgage rates have risen dramatically since then.\n\nSources: [https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/21/mortgage-refinance-millions-of-borrowers-just-missed-their-chance-to-save-.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/21/mortgage-refinance-millions-of-borrowers-just-missed-their-chance-to-save-.html) \n\n[http://www.freddiemac.com/pmms/](http://www.freddiemac.com/pmms/) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/di4t1gi881j81.png?width=1632&format=png&auto=webp&s=7885082cd5d9a69beb8254881c604b2699085d4b\n\n# Putting it all together with only a 50% drop in refinance volume\n\n**Q1: $48-$50B total origination volume**\n\nThat’s a 33%-38% drop from Q4 projected volume. \n\n**Q1 2022 volume likely will be Rocket’s worst origination volume since they did $40.1B in Q3 2019, down over 50% from $103B in Q1 2021.**\n\nEven if they hit their high end of guidance for Q4.\n\nEVEN WITH VERY CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATES of refi volume drop. \n\nThis is lower than pre-pandemic levels:\n\nQ4 2019: $50.8B\n\nQ1 2020: $51.7B\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMargins are dropping too.\n\n# TL;DR\n\n$RKT will miss earnings and issue horrible Q1 guidance due to plummeting refinance volumes.\n\nRocket will have a rough year.\n\n# Positions\n\n$RKT 50 9/16 12p", "id": "sx84h3", "created_utc": 1645382631.0, "score": 134, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 141, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|13|**First Seen In WSB**|10 months ago\n**Total Comments**|336|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q4zsek/uwmc_is_now_way_undervalued/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qx9car/uwmc_interesting_developments/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q5a5f5/uwmc_ready_for_liftoff/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qx9kgp/uwmc_ready_to_pop/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/sx84h3/rocket_is_gonna_crash/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/obcr17/uwmc_is_waaaay_undervalued/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r0qk1s/uwmc_dropping_hints/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nwdhqt/uwmc_dd_insider_purchase/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/obe3bz/uwmc_is_waaaay_undervalued/) \n**Account Age**|5 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=sx84h3)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=sx84h3)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I sold my entire rocket position a while back when I placed an offer on a house and the seller declined because the lender was rocket mortgage.", "score": 73, "replies": []}, {"body": "Long term bag hloder checking in.\n\nPain.
