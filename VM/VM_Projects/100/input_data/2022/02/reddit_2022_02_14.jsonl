So the $100 strike call you bought is now worth $5 and the $101 you sold is worth -$4 (because you sold it, it would cost $4 to buy back). Add those two numbers together and you get $1, which is the width of the spread. Since you paid $.40, deduct that from the $1 value of the spread and your net profit is the expected $.60.\n\nIt doesn't matter how ITM the spread is. Plug in different ITM values for XYZ, like $109 and $120, and the value of the spread will still come out to be $1.

It can be, if the stock ends up between the strikes instead of both legs being ITM. But using the prior example, if a $100/$101c spread expires with XYZ at $105, that is not a problem. Yes, the short call will be assigned, but the long call will be exercised by exception. The assigned call must deliver 100 shares and receive $10,100. The exercised call must deliver $10,000 and receive 100 shares. So you see that each leg cancels each other out and you net $100 differences, which is exactly the $1 width of the spread.\n\nNow all that said, because of that risk of the stock ending up between the two legs, you should not hold a spread through expiration.

Early assignment risk increases around the ex-dividend date of such underlyings, so be careful to exit or roll before an ex-dividend date.

And just like it would be if I sold the entire business, it will be sold at a price buyer and seller agree upon (which, at a starting point, will be the value of my company now, plus a premium based on projections for the future).\n\nThose interested in owning part of my company should have a pretty decent idea how much that stock is worth because they've done the math. Why would they buy if they're not going to get a paycheck from the earnings? Because they want to do what I did. I took one lemonade stand, turned it into 500, and sold a part of my ownership for a huge profit. They want to buy into a company with 500 stands, watch the company grow to 1000, 10,000 stands, and sell at some point in the future for a profit. Large investors may even get some measure of control over the company's destiny by controlling board seats or commanding voting power at shareholder meetings.\n\nCan prices get out of whack with the intrinsic value? Of course! There's a lot of wiggle room when it comes to forecasting the future part of a valuation. Remember, any buyer isn't only interested in how valuable the company is now, they're also interested in how valuable it could be in the future. A world war, to use your drastic example, would certainly create headwinds for the lemonade industry (lemon shortages, perhaps?) and cause people to see less potential in my company--hence a drop, even if my earnings was spectacular last quarter (stock prices are forward looking). On the flip side, forecasts could be sunny: no war, lemons are hot on tiktok. Whatever the book value of my business now, investors are calculating their return based on what they expect the value to be in the future. \n\nThat value can of course get completely absurd based on speculation and there are countless examples of that, but that's exactly when a smart investor either sells or refuses to buy. Will a lemonade stand business really ever make enough money to justify a $100 Billion valuation? No? Then sell that or don't buy it.\n\nBut to call Berkshire a scam really is embarrassing for a number of reasons. It shows everyone here that you have no idea even how to do the basic math of valuing a business, which is pretty fundamental to anyone who truly wants to understand the stock market. If you did the math, you'd likely realize that Berkshire's stock valuation is actually quite low compared to what you'd expect it to be, given conventional means of company valuation. By some measures, the sum of Berkshire's parts is actually worth more than its stock price *right now*, which could make it a good buy... if you think they'll continue to get bigger and more valuable in the future. A \"cheap\" valuation for a solid company is usually--but not always--a good investment. (My guess is that some hesitation about Berkshire's post-Buffett future is baked into the low valuation at the moment.)\n\nHopefully some of this is sinking in. Stocks have value because companies have value. The value of a company goes up, the price will go up. The value goes down it will go down. Outside factors can throw the stock prices off-- that's usually a time to buy or sell or hold on for dear life until things settle. None of this means stocks that don't pay dividends are scams-- dividend stocks can display the same irrational behavior.

It's pretty sad to see but luckily there are some who were able to give you legitimate answers", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Apologies for the long post but here's how I understand it.\n\nIn investment theory, the value of a business is based on the cash flows the business can produce discounted back at an appropriate discount rate. Practically though the future isn't perfectly knowable but people try to make predictions on the cash flows. Some predictions are more probable and plausible than others. For example, it is reasonable to expect that a company like Coca-Cola will continue to make similar amounts of cash as they did in the past given their relatively long history of business performance in doing so (from selling more volume of soft drink and raising prices). It is less reasonable to expect that a company with barely any assets, lots of debt and no history of positive earnings to be able to produce cash in the future (it may in the future but the probabilities based purely on the information given don't look too good).\n\nIf however things do go perfectly with the valuation, the business would earn the exact cash flows made in the valuation and the value of the business would increase at the discount rate (as would the share price). However as the future is unknowable people can have different estimates of the cash flows and there can be disagreements on what the discount rate should be. As such valuations can span a very large range. \n\nHowever, as investors are probably mostly humans they may and generally do suffer from biases and irrationality and these will factor in their valuations. As such many valuations can be extremely optimistic or extremely pessimistic. There is a range of valuations however which are reasonable based on available information. In the short run the competing valuations can send the share price to fluctuate, sometimes wildly. Not to mention the distortions added by other market players such as technical analysts, market manipulators, large institutions buying and selling, speculators, people wanting to sell stock to use the money elsewhere, etc. Over the long term though, the stock price does trend towards the range of reasonable valuations. Sometimes this can take years.\n\nShares are fractional ownership interests in a business and as such a shareholder is entitled to the earnings, cash and assets of the business. If shareholders wanted to access these they could band together and force management to pay a dividend, or sell the assets. Generally though they don't exercise their ownership rights since 1. the shareholders would need a combined majority stake in the business 2. organising and convincing enough shareholders to join in can be a lot of effort 3. shareholders may believe that management will be able to re-invest successfully to produce more cash in the future and hence increase they company's value 4. shareholder's simply can't be bothered to exercise their rights among other reasons.\n\nWhen Berkshire reinvests their profits in places where more even more cash can be produced the company directly becomes more valuable. The share price may not immediately reflect this because the majority of investors being human (mostly) can take a while to process this fact as well as there being distortions caused by non-fundamental analysts.\n\nThe goal of Berkshire is to increase the value of the business on a per share basis. They do this by investing in profitable ventures such as companies which generally have stable earnings, are able to earn high returns on invested capital and are selling at a discount to what they believe is a reasonable valuation (this is to safeguard against possible errors in calculation and adverse events that may occur which can reduce the value of their investment). As Buffett has demonstrably shown over decades that he is capable and successful of achieving this goal, by being not giving out dividends, he will have a massive cash pile ready to be deployed should outstanding investment opportunities arise, increasing the value of the business and hence over time, increasing the share price.\n\nAn investment operation is one which promises safety of principal and an adequate return. Operations not meeting this requirement are considered speculative. Berkshire assuming it's not selling at an expensive valuation, promises safety of principal due to the stability of the underlying businesses, and promises an adequate return from the underlying companies growing their profits and from stock prices reaching their underlying value (as Berkshire buys when the stocks are on discount).\n\nHopefully this helps.\n\nDisclosure: I own shares of Berkshire Hathaway Class B stock.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "I guess you know nothing about investing or you haven’t managed a single business in your life.\nI would suggest reading some books about value investing.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Sounds like you don't know the answer to his question since you didn't answer it.

You can take this two ways since ETFs were not around when that research was conducted, either you can add up the holdings of the ETF toward your diversification total, or you can treat it as a single stock.

Or maybe absent is the wrong word, because they are present in another form. \n\n1) **Crushing and humiliating military defeat**. Obviously this hasn't happened in a literal sense. But we are now two decades deep into a steady erosion of American geopolitical hegemony. Diplomatic influence is at perhaps an all-time low. Military strength remains largely unparalleled, but the nature of war has evolved past the point where that necessarily carries as much weight. Mutually assured destruction amongst nuclear-armed superpowers means that military conflict increasingly decomposes to proxy wars in developing nations. The US strategy in places like Syria and Ukraine is driving a wedge between Western interests and those sovereign states. The geopolitical center of gravity is shifting more and more each day to a multipolar state of affairs. Personally, I would view a multipolar state of affairs to mean that the US rapidly loses its current position (more on that below). \n\n2) **Lost status as global reserve currency**. This has been slowly and proactively in progress for quite some time, even if it has yet to come to fruition. As you probably know, the status of global reserve currency ultimately boils down to the petrodollar (hence our obsessive neo-colonial presence in the Middle East and support of Saudi Arabia) and global banking / the ability to exert sanctions on noncompliant nations. The petrodollar system has been jeopardized for some time, and continues to be eroded. The central narratives in American mainstream media against Iran and Russia are predominately related to enabling the US to continue throwing its weight around in international energy markets. The shift to renewable energies and electric vehicles is also very nascent but represents another force that threatens this strength. As it relates to the banking system, the 2008 financial crisis was a critical stress test, where the response effectively kicked the can down the road (and in my view is almost entirely responsible for the current predicament, even if it can be pinned more explicitly in the near-term on one-time fiscal stimulus excess, as if that compares to a decade and a half of quantitative easing).

One can rebalance that porfolio and put it in more conservative income generating assets and make even more money.  If there was a significant reliance on QYLD, they would have gained very little, or even lost total portfolio value.  Maybe one wouldn't care.  They will live for 20 years in retirement, die, and give their estate to their kids.  Maybe they don't care if they start off with 5M and it goes to 6M with a large investment in QYLD vs 10-12M if they diversified more.  Doesn't really make sense to me.\n\nFor instance, since COVID crash, QYLD has returned 12% and NDX returned 100%, including the recent drawdown of 15% over the past few months.\n\nI suppose I can see some value of QYLD in retirement or primary income generating portfolios but even then it's suspect at best.

These gains came despite the fact that the war overlapped with a bear market (2000–2002) and the associated deflation of the dot-com bubble burst.”\n\nRegardless with all the tailwinds of a strong economy + TSLA executing like a boss - we’re gonna be likely doing fine in the next several months!", "score": 7, "replies": []}, {"body": "Bullard with his SPY puts doing his magic.", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "Elon totally throwing Dave a bone here…", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "![gif](giphy|l0IybYgZM9izvdsTm|downsized)", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Timely gif coming off that joke of a commercial by GM!", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Greenlight Capital's David Einhorn, who has a history of betting against Tesla, just disclosed a new bet against the Elon Musk-led company.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "🌰 Still squirreling about accounts receivable I bet", "score": 5, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "So did Elon [solve world hunger or what?](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/elon-musk-gave-more-than-5-million-tesla-shares-to-charity-after-teasing-possible-donation-to-fight-world-hunger-11644885144?mod=mw_latestnews)", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "I thought back when he was selling shares that it would be a totally Elon move to donate like a billion towards solving world hunger… but if he really did give $5 billion that would be the boss moves of all boss moves!", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Fuck Russia.\n\n![gif](giphy|ovdh7odWsjwys)", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "Lol, Ukraine telling western leaders not to spread\npanic.

{"title": "Federal Reserve Emergency Meeting 11:30AM ET today; Russia Ukraine Geopolitical Crisis; Yield Curve dramatically flattens", "selftext": "**\\*\\*\\*\\* Latest Update on Emergency Meeting \\*\\*\\*\\***\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-short-term-rate-futures-pare-back-odds-fed-inter-meeting-move-2022-02-14/](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-short-term-rate-futures-pare-back-odds-fed-inter-meeting-move-2022-02-14/)\n\nMarkets gave a 30% chance of a rate hike on Thursday / Friday before the March meeting. Now it has shrivelled down to a **2% chance,** after comments from multiple Fed officials late afternoon Monday.\n\n**\\*\\*\\*\\* Update on 11:30AM ET Meeting \\*\\*\\*\\***\n\n**>>> Good news - no press release was released.** [https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/boardmeetings/20220214closed.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/boardmeetings/20220214closed.htm). **This means the meeting was considered a \"normal\" board meeting and not a real \"emergency\" meeting.**\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\* **IMPORTANT EDIT ABOUT EMERGENCY MEETING \\*\\*\\*\\***\n\nAs per further investigation and clarification from commentors, today's meeting is a **planned board meeting**. [https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/boardmeetings/20220214closed.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/boardmeetings/20220214closed.htm). A **Press Release will most probably not be made**, as Jan 18, Jan 14. Dec 6, Nov 16, Nov 15 all did not have press releases. (Checked via Wayback Machine). So, this is **90% NOT AN EMERGENCY MEETING**, as what I previously wrote. **If they decided to release a statement, then it will become an emergency meeting. Let's hope not :(**\n\n**By convention, in every meeting, they discuss if they should release details to the public - let's hope this time they DO NOT release anything to the public, and leave it as a normal meeting.**\n\nObviously during the meeting the board will discuss the issues I set at below:\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nHello everyone! Sorry I didn't update you all on my predictions for what the Fed will do in Janurary and my inflation forecast - was a tad bit busy - apologies!\n\n1. Every year February, new seasonal factors for inflation are calculated, causing rebalancing to affect inflation numbers. Used cars (40.5% v 37.3%) and energy prices had larger seasonal factors (though it decreased from 29.3% to 27%), whilst food prices this time again increased (7% v 6.3%).\n2. The Fed will have an ~~emergency meeting~~ (officially an **expedited meeting**) TODAY 11:30AM. They planned this late Thursday afternoon. According to [https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/boardmeetings/20220214closed.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/boardmeetings/20220214closed.htm), they're discussing: \"Review and determination by the Board of Governors of the advance and discount rates to be charged by the Federal Reserve Banks.\" Ie they'll be discussing what to do with interest rates. **NOTE**: **Some of you have said this is a planned meeting** **~~- this is incorrect. The next meeting is March 15/16.~~** **HOWEVER, it is TRUE that a board meeting is held every Monday -** [**https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/boardmeetings/meetingdates.htm**](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/boardmeetings/meetingdates.htm)**.** **~~However, NO PRESS RELEASES are made after each meeting - except today's one.~~** **\\*\\*\\* It's possible a press release might be made, but unlikely\\*\\*\\*. See** [**https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm**](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm)**.** The official terminology is a \"**closed board expedited meeting**\", which is not the same as say the COVID emergency meetings, ~~but is still considered an \"emergency\" meeting, since it is outside of the normal schedule.~~\n3. The Russia and Ukraine crisis seems to be more elevated, causing the US to speculate based on intelligence any attack is imminent in the following days. US and Russia talked on Saturday to no avail; France met with Russia Friday; Ukraine has requested an emergency meeting with Russia in the next 48 hrs, and other countries are quickly trying to resolve the situation through diplomatic means.\n4. The yield curve has flattened dramatically. The 10 year yield and 5 year yield are nearly the same number, and both are extremely close to the 30 year yield. The 2 year yield somewhat recovered a little on Friday, but 1.5% is awfully close to 1.955%. The 3 month yield also shot up to 0.338%. Fast flattening generally indicates extreme fear a recession is coming due to excessive Fed action.\n\n~~I'll write up a larger post in the near term on my analysis!~~\n\nIn general, I haven't done too much deep analysis, but presumably:\n\n1. **\\*\\*\\*\\* Important edit: The Fed will discuss these issues, but will most likely NOT release a press release. \\*\\*\\*\\*** The Fed's meeting will be **inconclusive**. The Fed's dual mandate is price stability and full employment, coupled with other secondary goals of GDP growth etc. Powell will most likely cite Russia and Ukraine's geopolitical crisis as a \"wait and see\" issue - ie like last time Omicron was a \"wait and see\" issue. **Oil, gas, defence related commodities, food etc might go up in the short term, due to stockpiling etc, pouring further fuel to the inflation flame**. However, the Fed will probably wait and see if diplomatic solutions can be made, and leave a final decision to the March meeting. They also know the yield curve has dramatically flattened, and any fast rate increase may tip the already fragile and fearful economy into panic mode. **According to even bearish critics, a rate hike in this meeting is extremely unlikely**. A possible scenario is QE stopping earlier by 1 month, which seems possible.\n2. Russia and Ukraine is complicated. Russia is in a tight spot after Putin's comments on **nuclear war being more likely** if Ukraine joins NATO: [https://youtu.be/RJXwLzII278](https://youtu.be/RJXwLzII278) (Bulletin of the Atomic Scentists ie Doomsday Clock). Both US and France's meeting seem to not have worked. Presumably I'm guessing, after these comments, Russia's WW2 generals had a hard long talk about what will happen to Russia, and what next steps they can do to stop a nuclear confrontation. I suspect some top level officials are already preparing to shield Putin away from using the nuclear launch codes in the future, similar to General Milley's actions toward Trump. However these are speculations. **Recently, satellite imagery from WSJ** and other journalists [https://youtu.be/7Hu5FErz1js](https://youtu.be/7Hu5FErz1js) show around 130,000 troops stationed. This shows some concrete evidence after Russia asked in the UN Security Council meeting if there was any evidence on the 100,000 number. The US will probably release further evidence this week. The US speculated based on intelligence Russia will invade anytime. I suspect Russia knows about **WW2's Operation Bodyguard and the Normandy Landings**, in which the allies purposely gave disinformation to the Germans. The US/EU knows Russia knows the EU and US knows this, which further complicates matters. I suspect intelligence was via spys, and Russia is frantically trying to find these spies. In general, Ukraine seems to want to quickly forge a diplomatic solution with Russia, since the US is hesitating on direct physical involvement. Presumaly, Ukraine and Russia will amend the Minsk Agreement in collaboration with the EU, and possibly install an increasing buffer zone (ie Russia moves troops 10 metres, Ukraine minuses troops etc etc). **I suspect this will drag on for some time.**\n\n**~~\\*\\*\\* On Emergency meetings:~~**\n\n~~It is TRUE that a board meeting is held every Monday -~~ [~~https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/boardmeetings/meetingdates.htm~~](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/boardmeetings/meetingdates.htm)~~.

This 99% won't happen. Putin is just mad because NATO said they wouldn't expand and then they farted in his face and expanded.

This is why you won't make money on the fed meeting or Russia, regardless of the outcome.\n\nLet's say Russia invades Ukraine after the fed announces a 6% rate hike. Ok, then what?

For example, ordinarily the government could reduce their spending to reduce aggregate demand, but due to the pandemic they are trying to pass BBB, which is the opposite of reducing spending. Alternatively, to curb consumer demand, you could raise taxes. That's pretty much always a bad move politically, but it's especially bad before midterms. Raising taxes is a double whammy for consumers, who have to deal with increasing prices at the same time. \n\nBasically, shit is fucked\n\nSort of unrelated - this is also why Biden can't cancel student loans, even though he ran on it as part of his campaign and now is getting killed for not doing it. Pausing student loan payments during the pandemic was a sort of mini-experiment where you could see what would happen to that money if people didn't have to give it to the bank, and people went out and spent it, because nobody gets paid enough.

{"title": "Inflation Is Already Worse Then The 1980s", "selftext": "Hi retards, i'm sure most of you are familiar with this, but the CPI has undergone massive changes over the decades, to the point people question the validity of the model for inflation specifically. Originally, like 1980s, the CPI was determined by comparing the price of a fixed basket of goods and services spanning two different periods. Now, the basket of goods can be changed rather frequently, and has been seen more as a cost of living index within the United States. As we saw in 2021 where they removed poultry and a lot of other goods from the CPI basket.\n\nHowever, if we were to plug todays numbers into the 1980s CPI formula purely looking for an output of cost of goods between two periods. We get [this](https://imgur.com/a/Dmhsqrx), note that this chart only accounts up until December 2021, the CPI has only gotten worse since then. One thing is certain, the Central Banks are dancing with an unknown fire with regards to monetary policy. The outcomes of which absolutely nobody can forecast, but it does look grim for the average consumer.\n\nOn an anecdotal point:\n\nI have a family friend that runs a small hole in the wall pizza joint in a strip mall. They are entirely family staffed by the big Italian family so don’t feel the brunt of labor shortage, more so only cost of goods increases. In 2015, their slices were priced at 2 dollars. In 2019, they increased prices to 2.50 a slice. Last month they just increased prices again to 4 dollars a slice. Obviously this is a single data point, but experience can be telling.\n\n🏳️‍🌈🐻 checking out", "id": "sshj5b", "created_utc": 1644863184.0, "score": 1035, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 295, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|15|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|141|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|5 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=sshj5b)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=sshj5b)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Eh, I'm only down 26% overall in my account.

No, economists haven't changed their perspective that the oil crisis was a major factor in the 1970s inflationary curve. Frankly, to suggest that it wasn't would be completely absurd. It very obviously was.\n2.

Economics tells a completely different story where cost dynamics are fundamentally multi-variate from various angles in the trade. The argument that it's solely a monetary policy issue basically suggests that all other factors are due to that policy, and while it's true that all of these factors interact, putting monetary policy above all of the other factors is a subjective belief, and not a reflection of how economies actually work. \n\nIf the world worked the way you suggest, the entire economy would fail to function as it does... and none of my models would ever work... but they do.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Here is a summary of the 1970s for you: https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/09/1970s-great-inflation.asp  \"Central bank policy, the abandonment of the gold window, Keynesian economic policy, and market psychology all contributed to this decade of high inflation.\"\n\nSo because you're a macroeconomist, somehow that makes you an expert on the subject?

You can expect production to start to gap up then when it becomes clear that keeping prices high is hurting volume sales and that will promote increased production in order to maximize return.\n\nIn other words, by the time the summer comes around the primary factor impacting CPI reporting will likely see a price drop, and the relative year over year costs will start to become relative to 5% inflation in June of 2021 rather than 1.4% in January of 2021.\n\nIn other words, for inflation to remain high, prices would have to start increasing DRAMATICALLY for inflation not to go down, while the rate of inflation is actually decreasing.\n\nThat will give the Fed cover to slow the rate increase curve being priced in right now.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "You are truly lost", "score": 0, "replies": []}, {"body": "I would rather have low inflation.
