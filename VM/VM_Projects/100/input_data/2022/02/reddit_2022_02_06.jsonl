{"title": "\"F\" - Ford $50 Price Target!!!! , TSLA - $500 Price Target!!!!", "selftext": "**Product Line**\n\nTesla have limited product line when it comes to EV’s, their most popular one model 3 and Y whereas Ford has better product line both in Consumer and Commercial including MachE, F-150 lighting and commercial EV vehicles. Ford is racing ahead in the commercial EV line and already has contracts with Walmart and others. Ford has the capability to deliver the commercial vehicles in 2022 -23 to businesses. \n\n**Margins**\n\nTesla’s biggest strength is their margins -Gross margin – 30%, Net Margin- 15% - 17% .Ford has lower margins (Gross – 15%, Net -8%) because they have lived in the old ICE (Internal Combustion Engine) world of lower margins However that’s changing and will change the path of Ford history of margins. The new blood in Ford has learned to focus and reduce the margins from Tesla itself and they are working to reduce cost and increase margins. Most likely they will take margins to next level in 2-3 years. \n\n**Valuation & Market Share** \n\nThe most controversial point that has jaded the most of us. Tesla has 900 billion valuation vs Ford’s barely $79 billion valuation. Given that Tesla’s revenue of 2021 - $53 Billion vs Fords $136 billion revenue. Ford being veteran and a value stock with dividends has been given lowest multiples of PE , Price to share for years because people never  thought that they would change or start a new product line, That’s changing now!! \n\nTesla has 70% market share in EV market and Ford with 5% but that’s about to change drastically. In a matter of couple of years Tesla will loose their ground in EV landscape and Ford will increase its market share to over 15% with their aggressive line of EV’s \n\n·**Moat**\n\nTesla had the moat with its manufacturing batteries, EV’s and automation. With time and effort that’s diluting and other auto manufactures have been able to manage to produce EV’s and batteries and eventually they will reach to automation as well. Ford is in the best position to beat Tesla in terms of higher quality EV, batteries and automation. \n\n**Marketing**\n\nTesla resonates with urban people and millennials which is good but Ford being 100-year-old firm comes with huge brand name and solid loyal customers. Fords new line of EV marketing and advertising has already done excellent job and proof is that they have over 270,000 orders within an year!!\n\n **High Interest rate Environment** \n\nWe are moving in high interest rate environment with global rate increases. Tesla is still labeled as growth stock in portfolio baskets and Ford has value stock label for decades. Ford has been rewarding shareholders with dividends. This high interest rate environment is better for Ford and Tesla will see winter. \n\n·**Team**\n\nLast but not the least. Obviously, Tesla has proven for years being a solid team of technologist and path breakers under musk leadership. Ford’s new CEO Jim Farley is best CEO ford has got in over several decades. Jim has clarity of vision and can execute that vision with smart and effective decisions. Within period of an year or so, he has taken steps to transform Ford to be a New age Auto manufacturer", "id": "slndrm", "created_utc": 1644113717.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.5, "num_comments": 144, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|27|**First Seen In WSB**|10 months ago\n**Total Comments**|50|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/slndrm/f_ford_50_price_target_tsla_500_price_target/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qlql2u/buy_aapl_by_eod_11042021_to_receive_the_dividend/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pub4pk/asan_super_short_candidate_with_handsome_puts/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mqq3cw/cp3_ai/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qlqnv2/buy_aapl_by_eod_11042021_to_get_the_dividend/) [x](https://i.redd.it/v45nbyd7oji71.jpg) [x](https://i.redd.it/n08nace2pji71.jpg) [x](https://i.redd.it/ojci00jmoji71.jpg) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pf479l/told_you_so_hood_will_fall/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pf49n0/told_you_so_hood_will_fall/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mu5fgk/prqr_has_over_300_upside_go_long_prqr/) \n**Account Age**|11 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=slndrm)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=slndrm)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I believe your name says it all friendo..", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "You missed an extra 0 on TSLA...

Signing up new customers for a pricey luxury service is expensive. Building the brand and infrastructure to provide a service people want is expensive -- and it might not even work. PTON's growth is slowing but it's an established, known entity that has proven it works. Not to mention these are generally high income customers who are potentially very valuable to an acquirer. It's not unreasonable to think the discounted value of those customers alone is worth a $8B price tag.\n\n>The brand name itself is linked with controversy, death of Mr.Big, on screen death on billions , lawsuit with luluemon, mismanagement and improper treatment of employees.\n\nNone of this has much relevance to the brand value.

There isn't some secret playbook Amazon, Apple et al are working with here -- this is pretty basic business logic understood by anyone with capital markets experience.\n\n>Besides why wouldn’t Amazon just wait for the company to bleed? Isn’t it already bleeding like it’s suffering from hemophilia? Any company would just let PTON bleed and then take it over no?\n\nOnce a company is priced in a reasonable range for acquisition, someone has to make a move before a competitor does. They could all wait for the stock to bleed more but then it becomes a fruitless game of chicken where the losers could have won if they had capitulated earlier.

I’m not sure when disposable diapers were invented but that person was a genius, my parents were great, but if you’re mentioned diapers, you regretted it lol. Wherever the discussion is about wealthy people I always think about that. You were rich if your could afford a service to clean your diapers, your are poor if your only has 5-8 diapers.  It simplifies things until of course disposable diapers were invented. This is the same, people want to invent a new diaper, whether it’s called FB, Apple, etc they invented stuff that people bought because NO ONE wants to hand wash diapers lol.

{"title": "How Tesla has conquered EV Batteries whilst the 'competition' struggles ...", "selftext": " ***How Tesla has the best Electric Vehicle batteries 🔋 on the market, and they've successfully secured their supply of these batteries for the foreseeable future. Something Competitors HAVEN'T done....***\n\nThe Battery quite literally powers the entire vehicle, it is thus not strange that for the average Electric Vehicle the battery accounts for ***50%*** of the production costs! Despite the market not knowing how to react to Tesla’s 4Q earnings call, there was some hidden gem hidden in the recent news that most people simply aren’t understanding. It is something that is going to be a key factor in determining which companies survive the future in the Automotive industry, and Tesla has already secured their place. Let me tell you….\n\n**Why are batteries so expensive and important?**\n\nThe future of Electric Vehicles will be constrained by the amount of available high-quality batteries, Elon musk himself even said in a 2018 tweet that:\n\n“Tesla vehicle production is limited by total battery output.”\n\nThis is still true in 2022 and will continue to be the case for the foreseeable future, until battery production meets the demand for Electric Vehicles. Batteries are so important because they account for such a large portion of the vehicles cost, but why are they so expensive? This is mainly due to the materials that make up the battery, due to the fact that the batteries need to be rechargeable the batteries use lithium-ion or sometimes also Nickel batteries.\n\nThe components that make the cathode (such as nickel, lithium or even cobalt) are the most expensive. This is because they need to be mined, processed into high-purity chemical compounds and THEN they’re set-up to be used in the battery. Although over the last few years battery prices have dropped 81% since 2013, their scarcity remains an issue\n\nThe demand for electric vehicles is simply out-pacing battery production. So you better hope your favourite car manufacturer has enough batteries to supply their vehicles. Unfortunately, this isn’t the case. Yet Tesla has positioned themselves not only to have the best performing batteries with the new 4680 batteries, they’re also continuously securing contracts for long-term supply of raw materials and batteries to power their 50% YoY volume growth for the fore-see able future.\n\nBefore you continue, Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my independent research and work!\n\nTesla has ensured that they are limiting the battery constraints for volume production whilst competitors are stumbling around the in the dark. Just look at the Fourth Quarter comments (below) made by “major-competitor“ Ford compared to Tesla’s comments regarding their battery capacity.\n\nNow let me talk about those 4680’s I mentioned and recent developments that have made Tesla’s battery supply even more robust.\n\n**4680’s & New Contracts - Tesla’s Battery advantage**\n\nTesla announced on September 2020 in their Battery Day conference that they where making the new and improved 4680 battery cells. These are currently being built in California but soon will also be built in Texas and are being supplied by Panasonic to help scale Tesla production. What is the importance of the 4680 cells for Tesla vehicles?\n\n· Changing from the currently used 2170 cells to the 4680s will increase range by 24% \\*\n\n· 5 X reduction in electrical path means you will be able to super charge faster\n\n· The thermal management of the entire battery pack is improved so the cell cooling will be much more efficient\n\n· The dollar costs per kilowatt hour should be reduced by 50%. That is an estimated decreased cost of production of about $7,000!\n\nOk so now you understand how important the 4680 battery cells are and that battery cells will be the main constraint for the production of future electric vehicles, let’s have a look at how Tesla is securing their battery supply.\n\nSecuring these batteries, and specifically the 4680’s is a crucial step that Tesla wants to complete to ensure they maintain the biggest market share of the entire Electric Vehicle industry. Elon Musk said in 2021:\n\n“So in Texas, we’re building the Model Ys with the structural battery pack and the 4680 cells, and we’ll start delivering after final certification of the vehicle, which should be fairly soon.”\n\nSo Tesla needs to be able to supply their cars using the 4680s really quickly and at a pace such that the batteries aren’t a bottleneck for production. The 4680 is also incredibly important for 2022 and 2023 when production of the Cybertruck will start.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe 4680 cells will provide the Cybertruck with the needed strength and power to move the huge truck around. Just recently Tesla purchased a large order with Panasonic to increase their supply of 4680 cells, Panasonic CFO Hirokazu Umeda said:\n\n“Tesla has put in an extremely strong request for the 4680, so when we are actually able to deliver the 4680, we plan to put top priority on Tesla. We’ll first prioritize supplying Tesla once the verifications are complete.”\n\nMeanwhile competing auto manufacturers are struggling to provide any significant amount of Electric Vehicles and will continue to struggle and face the brink of bankruptcy whilst Tesla continues to grow volume production just as fast, or faster than the EV adoption grows at.\n\nThis partnership and many similar to it will allow Tesla to pay the lowest amount per kwH for their battery cells because they have generated long-term relationships with their providers and continuously focus on reducing the cost of the battery.\n\n[Support my independent work and checkout similar articles](https://theteslafolder.substack.com/p/how-tesla-has-conquered-ev-batteries?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo2NDkwODA3MiwicG9zdF9pZCI6NDgyMTg2NzAsImlhdCI6MTY0NDA5MjI2OCwiaXNzIjoicHViLTY0OTk4NSIsInN1YiI6InBvc3QtcmVhY3Rpb24ifQ.O4MgcoIHQipPS1QtqBicjVfwjROTXqyzwcyMh7CE1Mo)\n\nTLDR Key-Take-Aways\n\n🔋 “Tesla vehicle production is limited by total battery output.”“\n\n💰 Introduction of the 4680 cells could decrease cost of production by about $7,000\n\n📏 4680 cells could increase range by 24%\n\n✍ Partnership with Panasonic could secure batteries for an additional 400,000 vehicles", "id": "sm5eth", "created_utc": 1644176318.0, "score": 149, "upvote_ratio": 0.73, "num_comments": 165, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|6|**First Seen In WSB**|1 month ago\n**Total Comments**|9|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|6 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=sm5eth)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=sm5eth)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "You really took this much time to do a DD on TSLA?
