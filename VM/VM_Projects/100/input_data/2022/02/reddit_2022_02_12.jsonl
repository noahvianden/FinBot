But the good news is these are temporary events. After 1-2 years, we'll find a way around Russian chokehold on these key materials, and inflation will probably be slowed. While that's happening, covid is still subsiding and innovation continue it's relentless march of driving productivity forward.\n\nTo be clear, **I'm not saying to buy the dip right now.** But I'm tempted to start a \"eat ramen\", \"get a third job\", \"cancel Netflix\" regime for myself to start preparing as much as possible to start buying mid or later this year.\n\nThese semi stocks are becoming the new FANGS, and this upcoming dip this year might be the best chance to buy them before they rocket into FANG status.\n\nOK here's the cons in my theory:\n\n* China could still be a ticking time bomb. Most experts say their lockdown strategy is not viable for Omicron. Could be their supply chain is a lot more broken than we realize. Plus that real estate problem is still ongoing and their president is kinda insane.\n\n* The Fed could freak out and raise rates too quickly, putting us into a recession.\n\n* Some industry reports say oversupply of semiconductors could happen as early as 2023.\n\n(Disclosure not investment advice and I'm long on NVDA AMD QCOMM MRVL TSM and maybe Int)", "id": "sqvm4k", "created_utc": 1644684312.0, "score": 1769, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 621, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 2709, "replies": [{"body": "And I sold at $14 üò≠", "score": 731, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 641, "replies": [{"body": "On a percentage basis that's hedge fund returns lolol", "score": 324, "replies": [{"body": "That's way better than hedge fund returns.

Fill the saucepan with cold water about halfway, maybe just under for a large saucepan. Put it on the stove and set it to max heat. Add a pinch of salt to make it boil quicker. Keep a vague eye on it and turn it down if it might bubble over.\n3. Put a dribble of oil in the frying pan (make a splodge about 2 inches / 10cm wide) and turn the pan up to a medium heat (if your stove has numbers 0-9, probably go for 5, if you have numbers 0-4, probably 2, basically the middle number).\n4. Put the onion and beef in the frying pan. Remove any plastic/paper film from the beef if there is one. Try not to get raw beef on your hands or the countertop if you can avoid it.\n5. Wash your hands. Eating raw beef can make you ill. Not as bad as raw chicken, but still worth washing.\n6. Break the beef up with a wooden spoon or spatula or something (basically anything that isn't metal because metal will scratch the non-stick coating on the pan).\n7. By now, your water is probably boiling. You'll know because you'll see lots of tiny bubbles. Grab some spaghetti and wrap your index finger and thumb around it. If it's a correct-sized portion, the tip of your thumb should land roughly at the smallest knuckle of your index finger. Take your portion of spaghetti, snap it in half, and put it in the saucepan.\n8. Stir the beef every so often until it is brown all over.\n9. Put the pepper and a tin of tomatoes in the frying pan. Squeeze about a third of the pur√©e in (or if you have passata, pour about a quarter of the passata in).\n10. Pour a bit of the herbs into your hand. Chuck 3-5 pinches of them in the frying pan.\n11. Turn the frying pan down to a low heat (basically a quarter of max). Wait until the spaghetti has boiled for 10 minutes. Stir the frying pan a bit in the meanwhile.\n12. Turn off the heat for the saucepan and drain the spaghetti. Serve the spaghetti on a plate.\n13. Turn off the heat for the frying pan. Serve a quarter of the bolognese on the plate. Serve the rest of the bolognese into 3 containers. Let the containers cool on the side while you eat your meal. When you've finished eating, pop the containers in the freezer (you can't put them in while they're hot because it would warm up the freezer too much).\n14. Next time you want to enjoy some spagbol, just take one of the containers out the freezer, defrost it in the microwave and boil some spaghetti to go with it!", "score": 27, "replies": [{"body": "$MCD just dropped 4% thanks to this post.

Here's a [link](https://www.npr.org/2022/02/09/1079338002/russia-ukraine-europe-gas-nordstream2-energy) showing the relative dependence of Russian natural gas of various European states. It seems unlikely that Russia will fully cut the flow, for the obvious economic reprecussions, however the pipelines in the Ukraine could be disrupted or destroyed in the case of an invasion. In that scenario, gas and by extension, energy prices in Europe will likely rise dramatically in the short term.  \n\n\nThis will likely cause European nations to attempt to wean themselves off Russian energy in the long-term, they could do this by importing more petroleum products from countries such as Australia or the middle eastern states. In the long-run, I expect the European powers try to become more energy independent, like France's recent [announcement](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/10/france-to-build-up-to-14-new-nuclear-reactors-by-2050-says-macron) of building additional nuclear reactors.

Eg when we ran to $1200 the first time, that was a monster run, and I didn't even come close to danger, just kept rolling up and out, and made a profit on every roll due to the volatility.\n\nAnyway, i think the last part is key, you just need to be disciplined enough to roll when catalysts happen.

I am a member for about 10 years i think. It's main interaction section is a public forum. Old school but very effective in distributing spaceflight related information and getting involved.\n\nNSF also had a closed payed membership section that a small fraction of people subscribe to and that pays all the bills. I am a member there for a long time too. Something has to pay the servers and i am glad they use a membership instead of advertising. The closed ares contains information that is later distilled into news articles. So you get a view behind the scenes. And it's fantastic, as you can talk to very knowledgeable persons. There as well as in the public forum. There is a guy who worked approximately 100 shuttle missions. There are people from NASA, SpaceX, Bigelow, ULA, many rocket nerds. A strong mod team holds the crowd in check. The strong mod team is the main reason this site works so well.\n\nIf you want to find payload manuals on any rocket, you will probably find it there. Documents related spaceflight that are not exactly secret but you can't find anywhere else. It's a fantastic model and a glowing example how media could work!\n\nRob, i whish you all the best with it. Look at NSF and if you copy the strength, you will do good.

In addition to that, if you start selling lower priced vehicles, your demand for the higher ASP vehicles drop. More models also adds more complexity, having less models makes it easier for Tesla to focus on existing models and accelerating their competitive advantage over other EVs. Not only in terms of margins but also in terms of the design iterations on the fewer models.\r\n\nNow this doesn't mean that Tesla won't ever sell a 25k model, but as it currently stands it makes no sense for Tesla to do so.

No! I grew up in Europe and forever have we been fearing the Russian invasion, that never ever happens. You know how many times Russia ‚Äúalmost‚Äù took over? Yes, never since the collapse of the USSR, to the contrary, the NATO is Inching closer to Russia, then Russia inching towards us, and we are effectively surrounding Russia on all sides.\n\nRussia is powerful, but can never, ever win against the NATO, it‚Äôs completely unrealistic. Anybody who believes that Russia starts a serious war against the West has completely lost touch with reality. Not even the fucking COLD WAR turned HOT. So stick your anxiety pills up your butthole and relax.\n\nAnyway, how can you make money with this? Looking at the reaction of the market today, it‚Äôs evident, that the entire stock market is completely retarded for contracting due to some White House announcement that‚Äôs obvious distraction from the actual problems. Coincidence that record Inflation numbers are coming out, and they push the same ol Russian shit?\n\nThe way to make money is by believing that they will remain irrational, and betting on it.\n\nI made most of my money through Oil, because I knew that environmentalist were gonna shutdown oil supplies, when demand is steadily going up = Oil go up. But people were shorting Oil because Tesla was growing??\n\nOnce you understand how retarded the world is, you‚Äôll make money.\n\nThe smart thing might be to sell Gold, because fed will raise rates, then bearish for gold and commodities right?!?\nAnd buy Puts?!?\n\nRemember to smoothen that brain surface. \n\nThe Fed has constantly been lying about inflation being transitory, why would they tell the truth about raising rates significantly? \nThey are NOT going to cause a recession during an election year, Powell is basically part of the Biden administration.

Y'all gonna preach that inflation is super fucking high and money is devaluing quick af and also say it's fucking unsustainable that market is up 120% in the last 2 years or so.  \n\n**If it's the currency losing value quick, isn't it unsurprising that the market is going to perform good?** I mean, it's an alternative value holder to currency.\n\nLet me show you a smooth brained example. **Say you are a farmer like 1000 years ago, and you buy a cow for 10 gold coins.** Now, let's say your retarded kingdom faces an inflation so high it causes the price of the cow to go up 1 gold coin each year. Now, after 10 years, your cow is worth 20 gold coins! Did you make money? Fuck no, it's just that gold coins lost value and cows did not.\n\n**You wouldn't fucking talk about \"the imminent crash of cow prices\" if everything went up in price just because the cows did too.**\n\nAnd for those of you who think inflation isn't real? **Two years ago, I bought a cheeseburger at McDonald's for 1‚Ç¨, now it's worth like 1,40‚Ç¨.** I would also buy a protein shake at my local gym for 1‚Ç¨, now it costs 1,40‚Ç¨. The kebab place I frequented would cost 2‚Ç¨ per kebab, now it's like 2,90‚Ç¨ or some shit. \n\n*If you look past the March 2020 dip, we are only up some 42% at the SPY ATH. Going back to the previous cheeseburger / protein shake / kebab example, those prices are also up some 40%.* This is irrefutable proof that it's not actually market going up, but currency going down and market adjusting. \n\nSo saying \"this growth is unsustainable\" and \"we are in for a correction\" is fucking retarded if you think stocks only go up (which they do) since in theory, stocks have gone up 0% in the past 2 years (going back the the previous cheeseburger example). **Unless the prices of cheeseburgers also correct down, I don't see market correcting itself by a huge margin. If you think stocks only go up, that is.** Which you do. \n\n**This is obviously not financial or investment advice.** If you didn't gather it from the cow example, I'm fucking retarded.

Consistent with the Scenario Design Framework, under the severely adverse scenario, the U.S. unem- ployment rate climbs to a peak of 10-3/4 percent in the third quarter of 2022 (see table A.5), a 4 percentage point increase relative to its fourth quarter 2020 level.11 Real GDP falls 4 percent from the end of the fourth quarter of 2020 to its trough in the third quarter of 2022. The decline in activity is accompanied by a lower headline consumer price index (CPI) inflation rate, which quickly falls to an annual rate of about 1 percent in the second quarter of 2021, and stays at that level for another quarter before gradually rising to 2-1/4 percent by the end of the scenario period.In line with the sharp decline in real activity, the 3-month Treasury rate remains near zero throughout the scenario. The 10-year Treasury yield immediately falls to 1/4 percent during the first quarter of 2021 and stays there through the first quarter of 2022, after which it gradually rises, reaching 1-1/2 percent by the end of the scenario period. The result is a gradual steepening of the yield curve over much of the scenario period.\n\n\\*here's the answer on the rate hike, though... likely conservative using the word gradually. monday will be telling of what gradual means.\n\nthe test is all about finding the weakest money masseuse and cutting off their hands. they look at wha their losses may be in a 'severely' adverse situation, doesn't look great.\n\n>Changes in supervisory stress test results across exer- cises reflect changes in‚Ä¢ firm starting capital positions;41‚Ä¢ the scenario used for the supervisory stress test;‚Ä¢ portfolio composition and risk characteristics; and ‚Ä¢ models used in the supervisory stress test.Under the supervisory severely adverse scenario, the aggregate CET1 ratio is projected to decline to a minimum of 10.6 percent before rising to 11.2 per- cent at the end of nine quarters (see table 3). In the aggregate, each of the five capital and leverage ratios declined over the course of the projection horizon from their levels in the fourth quarter of 2020, with levels in the first quarter of 2023 ranging from1.0 percentage point to 1.8 percentage points lower than at the start of the projection horizon (see table 3).\n\nnow we're getting to the meat and bones of this bullshittery:\n\n>Projected LossesThe Federal Reserve projects that the firms as a group would experience $474 billion in losses on loans and other positions in the aggregate over the nine quarters of the projection horizon.These losses include‚Ä¢ $353 billion in accrual loan portfolio losses;‚Ä¢ $4 billion in securities losses;42‚Ä¢ $86 billion in trading and counterparty losses at the 12 firms with substantial trading, processing, or custodial operations; and\n\n[not cool](https://preview.redd.it/if8ymgw9hfh81.png?width=526&format=png&auto=webp&s=37b0d66c9c694435a2e954985c61eae5858e7301)\n\njust to me this seems like a lot of money, and though this is a severely adverse situation they're describing its in my opinion in reality it's already much worse.\n\n[phenomenal risk management table shit](https://preview.redd.it/ytv0rypchfh81.png?width=1108&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9f8f04e1cff46bc24be9271c7a18dc100de8f13)\n\nthere are a ton more tables under these that get more specific on each firm and the primary source of their losses. it's pretty interesting stuff considering everyones head in the sand in spite of these glaring issues which have painted them into a corner.
