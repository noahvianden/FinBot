FB needs Apple, Google, and other websites to allow tracking of cookies for effective ads. If ads aren't effective, companies will quit paying and we are seeing that now.\n* Meta has put in a TON of money into the Metaverse and for the metaverse to be successful people need to come back form work/office and put on an oculus headset essentially until they go to bed. After lockdowns, I feel people need more face to face connection and would seek that rather than metaverse connection.

As of Monday, the stock is down about 31% year to date.\n\n> The news of Foley stepping down comes ahead of Peloton’s fiscal second-quarter results, which are set to come after the market closes on Tuesday.\n\n> Peloton told the Journal it expects to cut roughly $800 million in annual costs and reduce capital expenditures by roughly $150 million this year.\n\n> The company also said in the report that it plans to wind down the development of its Peloton Output Park, the $400 million factory that it was building in Ohio. It said it will reduce its delivery teams and the amount of warehouse space it owns and operates.\n\n> William Lynch, Peloton’s president, is also expected to step down from his executive role but remain on the board, Foley said in an interview with the Journal. Erik Blachford, a director since 2015, is expected to leave the board. And two new directors will be added, the Journal said: Angel Mendez, who runs a private artificial intelligence company focused on supply chain management; and Jonathan Mildenhall, former chief marketing officer of Airbnb.\n\n> Roughly a week ago, activist Blackwells Capital — which has a less than 5% stake in the company — sent a letter to Peloton’s board urging Foley to quit his role as CEO, and asking the company to consider selling itself.\n\n> Reports have since circulated that potential suitors could include Amazon or Nike. However, Foley along with other Peloton insiders had a combined voting control of roughly 80% as of Sept. 30, which would make it practically impossible for any deal to go through without their approval.\n\n> Foley, 51, founded Peloton in 2012.

Is it the CEO, or the investors, or a combination? I think it's a combination. A blind man could have seen that the growth of PTON was due to people not being able to go to a gym and that this was always going to be temporary. If the CEO and the rest of the executive at PTON thought otherwise, they were fools. If investors, and I'm not talking about people buying 100 shares, I'm talking the fund managers, didn't see this for what it is, they should be out of a job as well. All this stock was ever good for was catching it at the right time in the early days of the pandemic and selling after doubling or tripling your money. I have owned a Peloton bike for 5 or 6 years now and I was not foolish enough to buy into the idea that this growth was limited for a number of reasons, the smallest being the pandemic. I think the cost of the bike and the monthly fees are bigger inhibitors than people being stuck inside for the better part of a year. \n\nThe other nail in their coffin is remote work. I initially purchased my PTON bike because of my schedule. I used to get up for work between 4:30 and 5:00 AM, to catch a 5:30 train to NYC, and then get home around 6:00 PM. Last thing I wanted to do was get changed and go to a gym at the same time everyone else was, then eat dinner at 8:00 PM. So I got the bike. But I've been working remotely for going on 2 years.

The market for peloton going forward is for the people who realized the time they gained by not going to the gym (travel there, change, shower) and will keep using the bike (or whatever they’re doing) at home. Spend that time with your kids or doing whatever else. Remote work also makes it easier for a lot of people to exercise, over the lunch hour or whenever it may be so they may actually be harder to keep. \n\nThe other market is people who want a premium spin class regularly but don’t want to spend $25 three times a week to attend in studio. Peloton works out being cheaper. \n\nFor me it’s a convenience product that is more premium than some of the other home fitness alternatives.

The social-media company is set to announce its earnings on Thursday.\n\nWood’s flagship ARK Innovation ETF dumped 3.66 million shares of Twitter on Monday, while the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF sold more than 280,000 shares, according to the asset manager’s daily trading updates.

She was facing two full weeks alone in the nearly 6,000-square-foot house she bought with her ex-husband in the 1990s.\n\nThen she felt it.\n\n“Wham,” Ms. Wood said last year on the “Jesus Calling” podcast, which is centered on the devotional writings of the best-selling Christian author Sarah Young. “I really feel like that was the Holy Spirit just saying to me, ‘OK, this is the plan.’”\n\nThe plan was for Ms. Wood to use her experience as a tech investor to build a new kind of money management firm — optimized for the social media age and embracing a level of transparency that was radical, at least on Wall Street.\n\nTo do it, Ms. Wood had to quit her job and put her personal wealth on the line at the age of 57.\n\n“Most of my friends told me I was nuts, and yet I wasn’t listening to them. I knew that I needed to follow God’s will for me,” she told a Christian ministry organization in 2016.\n\nThe article pointed out something interesting, her \"tendency to present her investment decisions as near certainties was unusual.\" She seems almost too confident on how the future is going to unfold, from what I've heard of her talks. That kind of conviction sounds confident and phropethic There is something about her zeal that seems otherworldly.\n\nCompared to most fund managers except Ackman and a few others, making so many appearances on CNBC and elsewhere puts her more in the limelight, and more subject to scrutiny.

{"title": "Consumer debt totals $15.6 trillion after a record-breaking increase in 2021", "selftext": "Consumers ended 2021 with record levels of debt, leading into a year in which interest rates are expected to rise substantially. Total debt at the end of the year came to $15.6 trillion, an increase of $333 billion in the fourth quarter and just over $1 trillion for the year, according to data released Tuesday from the Federal Reserve’s New York district. The quarterly rise was the biggest since 2007, and the annual gain was the largest ever in records going back to 2003. The increases came ahead of a period in which the Fed is expected to start jacking up interest rates as it looks to tamp down inflation running at its fastest pace in nearly 40 years. Markets expect the central bank to start hiking rates in March and to enact at least five increases this year totaling 1.25 percentage points. Fed interest moves are directly tied to the prime rate that consumers pay for many forms of debt, including credit cards and adjustable-rate mortgages.\n\nA large chunk of the debt load increase came from mortgages, which saw balances rise by $890 billion for the year and $258 billion in the fourth quarter, to nearly $11 trillion. Mortgage originations for the year totaled more than $4.5 trillion, a new record. Credit card balances increased by $52 billion in the final three months of the year, a new quarterly record that brought total debt in that category to $860 billion. Owning to the rapid gain in prices, auto loan balances rose by $90 billion, or 6.6%, to $1.46 trillion. New auto prices rose 11.8% for the year while used vehicles soared by 37.3%, according to Labor Department data.\n\nOne area that saw little increase was student loans, which edged higher by just $20 billion for the year and actually declined marginally in the fourth quarter. Forbearance programs, though mostly expired, are still keeping balances and delinquencies in check. New York Fed researchers saw the rising-rate environment could affect household cash flows as borrowers adjust. Those who locked in at low mortgage rates, for instances, are likely to be reluctant to go out and buy new homes with rates moving higher, while those who ran up credit card balances could be constrained as financing costs increase.\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/08/consumer-debt-totals-15point6-trillion-after-a-record-breaking-increase-in-2021.html", "id": "snp3rt", "created_utc": 1644339829.0, "score": 336, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 197, "comments": [{"body": "Jesus Christ, what are you guys buying?", "score": 184, "replies": [{"body": "People are buying too much house and too much car.

So, unless they pay additional toward their principal or they refinance to a shorter term, the refinance has the potential to be more costly in the end.

The in-depth tesla investor probably spends 20+ hours out of pure interest. There is a lot of difference from a regular 9-5 job and doing something out of interest. The difference lies in they haven´t watched 100 hours’ worth of Elon musk interview to fully understand Elon and how genuine he always is, they don’t have the time to see drone flyovers to see how quickly development happens at new factories before they are already done, they don’t listen to Munro awe over the cars, they don’t know the difference in culture and priorities between Legacy and Tesla. Most of all they don’t understand how fanatical most Tesla customers become once they own a Tesla. Tesla is a real 21st century company, comparing tesla to any other company misleads you more than it helps.

{"title": "Meta's market value plummeted by 1.5 trillion. One of the reasons is that it can't beat TikTok?", "selftext": "Recently, Meta announced its first financial report after its name was changed, followed by a \"Tragedy\" in which the share price plunged by 26.39%.\n\nUnder the share price collapse, Meta's market value evaporated $237.6 billion.\n\nAccording to the financial report, Meta's revenue in the fourth quarter was US $33.671 billion, a year-on-year increase of 20%; The net profit was US $10.285 billion, a year-on-year decrease of 8%.\n\nIn fiscal year 2021, Meta's \"reality labs\" business had an operating loss of $10.193 billion and a revenue of $2.274 billion.\n\nThroughout the weak performance of Meta in the fourth quarter, there are three main reasons.\n\nFirst, the privacy policy changes of platforms such as Apple and Google have a huge impact on advertisers' income.\n\nOn April 27, 2021, Apple IOS 14.5 was officially released, accompanied by the strongest privacy rules in Apple's history. Under this privacy rule, if the app or company wants to stay on the IOS system, it must study its own attribution scheme and cooperate with Apple's skadnetwork for technical docking.\n\nAfter the introduction of the new privacy policy, advertisers face two challenges. First, the accuracy of advertising positioning decreases and the cost of advertisers increases. Second, it is difficult to measure the effect of advertising.\n\nThis also means that under the shackles of Apple's new privacy policy, many of Meta's revenue businesses will also be affected to a certain extent.\n\nSecond,  Metaverse‘s business is still in the money burning stage, and its contribution to Meta's income is limited, which will even drag down the development of overall performance for a long time.\n\nZuckerberg also warned of this situation. In July 2021, Zuckerberg mentioned in his vision description of Metaverse that \"in the next three years at least, Meta's  Metaverse business needs long-term capital investment, and the possibility of profit is very small, which will compress Meta's profit space and put pressure on meta's cash flow.\"\n\nThe release of the four seasons newspaper mentioned that Meta's \"Metaverse\" strategy is in continuous loss. The development department realitylabs had a revenue of less than $2.3 billion in 2021, but a loss of more than $10 billion. It is the loss of this department that has dragged down Meta's overall profitability.\n\nThird, the growth of Facebook users in Meta's traditional business stagnated, facing the impact of competitors represented by tiktok.\n\nAccording to the financial report, Facebook has 1.93 billion live users in the four seasons, a year-on-year increase of 5%, but lower than the 1.95 billion expected by the market; Monthly live users reached 2.91 billion, a year-on-year increase of 4%, lower than the 2.95 billion expected by the market.\n\nIt can be seen that the growth momentum of Facebook's number of users is obviously insufficient. An important reason is that short video products seize the users of traditional social products.\n\nAmong them, TikTok poses the greatest threat to Facebook. Zuckerberg admitted on the earnings conference call that \"TikTok is such a powerful competitor that it can continue to grow at a fairly fast speed on the basis of having a large user base\".\n\nRich Greenfield, a partner of lightshed, a consulting firm, said frankly that meta is facing a life and death threat from TikTok.\n\nIn fact, the \"catch-up\" between TikTok and Facebook began as early as 2017.\n\nIn November 2017, byte beat acquired music, which Zuckerberg spent six months still unable to reach Ly, accompanied by musical More than 200 million users of the ly platform, as well as the accumulation of technologies, products, operations and other capabilities, are all incorporated into TikTok.\n\nThe rapid trend that TikTok has maintained since its launch has also triggered frequent \"provocations\" by Facebook.\n\nDuring the sale of TikTok in 2020, Zuckerberg repeatedly \"instigated\" TikTok to the local regulatory authorities that there were various unsafe vulnerabilities and data disclosure behaviors, so supervision should be strengthened.\n\nAt the same time, when tiktok fell into the dilemma of \"blocking\", Facebook quickly increased its investment in instagram and launched reels, a short video function with 15 seconds or 30 seconds, copying the short video playing methods and functions similar to TikTok, waiting for the opportunity to seize the market.\n\nHowever, in this battle after battle, tiktok still strongly maintained its top position in the industry, and even jumped to the top of the global list of popular mobile app downloads.\n\nLast September, TikTok announced that its global monthly active users had exceeded 1 billion, and it took only four years to achieve this feat. Facebook, as the global social overlord, spent eight years.\n\nAccording to the mobile app report for the fourth quarter of 2021 released by sensortower, TikTok's download volume ranks first in the world of mobile app, maintaining an overall leading position in 2021.\n\nTo sum up, Meta is indeed in danger and in a dilemma.

No, I’m trying to get you to back up your original claim as I have said repeatedly. I made no claim to any effect other than the person I replied to was suffering from recency bias. You came in with a demonstrable false claim that I asked you to back up. Was I aware of the answer before asking? Of course, I’m coming from a place of legitimate debate based on actual performance, intention, and do so in relation to other fund managers in similar scenarios and time frame. That is how comparisons work. Oddly enough I do still live with my mom, or rather she lives with my family in our on-property guest house we like to call  “The Casita.”  Credit where credit is due to you there I suppose. \n\n2. No. You can’t claim to skin when it was the literal first sentence. Furthermore, This is recent bias just like the last one. Performance is obviously an indication of success, but sure there are other factors. Leveraged ETFs and managed funds with a history of over performance are not equal with regards to risk. You could achieve equal risk with a 3x ARK fund, but again not the same. As such, they are not worth comparing just like it’s not worth comparing the returns of a fund manager versus those of a retail investor. Retail investing is easy; hard to beat Buying and holding top 5 companies in and year out. It is also not fair to compare to closed funds because they do not suffer from AUM inflow/outflow issues and forced restructuring (clearly relevant considering the only reason you are even making this claim is due to 2021 performance).  It is worth comparing her to other active fund managers in the same bull market. This is what is referred to as a “fair comparison” in that all things considered, the playing field is equal. \n\n\n3. You mentioned goalposting earlier. I have asked, from your very first comment, that you simply back up your claim that she is gambling who makes her picks based on the Word of God and that any donkey could do it in the same market. That’s what I then, and continue to now ask you to back up. You said it. You said any donkey could do it yet you haven’t provided a single example of a fund manager doing it in the same environment she is in. I went on to acknowledge, with full understanding that leveraged QQQ ETFs beat, but that’s not what you said. You said any donkey could do it, so clarification was necessary on what you are claiming any donkey or human could do. Since closed funds and private investments are not the same environment in which she works, you should have understood this from the get go since it was your claim. \n\nCathie is not a laughing stock, but she is a target. No one except for specific fans like perennial winners especially when they dominate (See Bulls, Patriots, Yankees, etc). Prior to her massive AUM increase her funds matched/beat even those leveraged ETFs and private funds you are referring to, but in a significantly more difficult environment. Either way your comparisons are invalid, or at best inaccurate due to misunderstandings of market processes. \n\n4 Bonus question - What were you referring to when I said I was learning finance?

For example current car chips are using a decade old tech, which is also why Intel is repurposing the fab in Ireland to produce car chips and encouraging car companies to advance to smaller size chips.

That is wrong. TSMC wanted a **deposit** from Intel in advance (makes sense since Intel is a fab so they might tell TSMC later that they don't want it and manufacture it themselves). **But** that happened in **December 15th, 2021** (3 months ago) [link](https://www.techpowerup.com/289937/tsmc-wants-payment-in-advance-to-give-intel-access-to-3-nanometre-node)**.**\n\nOn the other hand, Intel and TSMC already had an agreement for the production, before any payment and before specifics were really discussed, in **January 27, 2021** (a year ago). About 11 months before any talk between Intel and TSMC regarding 3nm deposit payment [link](https://www.gizchina.com/2021/01/27/tsmc-will-manufacture-3nm-chips-for-intel-in-the-second-half-of-2022/).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>intel doesn't even have the tools to make 20a - and won't - for years.\n\nHmm, are you aware that Intel 20A release is due in Q3 2024? Not start of work but actual finish and ability to manufacture with? That is in 2 years and 4-7 months that process will be ready to manufacture. A process that is superior to today's TSMC 3nm process.\n\nAnd if you think that is a long time to make a deal, I'll go back to Apple and point out a simple **fact**. [Apple ordered 3nm chips from TSMC](https://www.mobilescout.com/smartphone/news/n117304/apple-places-orders-tsmc-for-3nm-chips-mac-2022/) in December 24, **2020.**\n\nI'll repeat - Apple ordered **non existing** chips **2 years in advance**.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>qualcomm's ceo immediately refuted pat's claim (days later) during their conference call and merely said that they're open to it and excited to see 20a.\n\nYeah.. No. That was not what he said. I actually listened to all last 3 earning calls of Qualcomm just to find out exactly when he said it and what exactly he said.\n\nFrom Qualcomm Q3 2021 earnings call -\n\n>**Cristiano Renno Amon** \\- QUALCOMM Incorporated - President and CEO  \n>  \n>Thanks for the question. Look, it's actually very simple. Qualcomm, we're probably one of the few companies that, given our scale, is able to have multi-sourcing at the leading node. We have 2 strategic partners today, which is TSMC and Samsung. And we're very excited and happy about Intel deciding to become a foundry and investing in leading node technology to become a foundry. I think that's great news for the United States fabless industry. We are engaged. We are evaluating their technology. We don't yet have a specific product plan at this point, but we're pretty excited about Intel entering the space. I think we all determined that semiconductors are important and resilient supply chain is only going to benefit our business\n\nThere was absolutely nothing in that earnings call about Intel 20A. Qualcomm CEO said - **We are engaged. We are evaluating their technology. We don't yet have a specific product plan at this point**\n\nIn other words they are talking, Qualcomm would not have any interest in processes up to Intel20A because TSMC and Samsung offer 3nm already. So they are talking about specific processes, obviously, but they do not have a product plan yet to put for that process.\n\nWhen Intel talked with TSMC about 3nm in January 2021, they did not have a product plan either. Gelsinger wasn't the CEO yet and didn't display his production plans yet. When it was leaked by TSMC that they will produce 3nm for Intel, Intel didn't have a product plan nor was the deal closed yet. Sounds familiar?

It has had 2 major mutations in 18 months alone already.   There already are 4 Omicron mutations of concern.  An Omicron infection for a boostered individual usually results in mild symptoms.   Not necessarily so for a two shot individual.  For an unvacinnated moron, you could end up in the box or jar, depending on a lot of factors.  BTW, 2,000 Americans died today of covid.  I know a few people-- unvaxed of course, who bit the bullet in the last few months.  Do you?\n\nThe next mutation may well be more deadly than Omicron.  Omicron's mildness surprised scientists, they expected the opposite.  The mRNA vaccines are safe and real world tested, billions of people have succesfully taken them, and they are readily adaptable.  We will need yearly boosters, and the pill is no substitute.  Every week new studies are being published that a bad case of covid results in brain function impairment, and there is building evidence that the same may be linked to early onset alzheimer's.  Some studies have found that even a mild case of covid results in the virus remaining in vital organs AND the brain months after recovery.  Most Americans are unaware of potential long term risks--- in a few months they will be WELL aware.\n\nBiontech and Pfizer now possess the single most profitable vaccine/drug in history.  Orders are secured for 2022 that will match the whopping revenue announced today.  Biontech announces at the end of March, it will make $20 BILLION IN 2021.  IT'S CURRENT P/E is around 5.  If it's share price falls much lower, it's book value will equal it's cash horde.  Makes no sense.  But It's pipeline is a 5 year play.  You apes play options, you aren't playing in the same stadium.  Biontech will have marketable cancer treatments, humanity changing treatments without a doubt within 5 years.\n\nSure Americans believe the pandemic is over.  Wall St squid have driven the Vax stock share prices into the toilet, but Biontech is making billions and will continue to do so, as the yearly boosters roll up.  Wall St loves growth though, and no doubt revenue will decrease in 2023, but not as much as is being predicted by the squid.  But it won't matter, because growth will be negative, so the street will continue to punish, unless the virus storms back, which it may well do.  \n\nThe accepted truth is that the pandemic is over.  It ain't over, it's in a lull, but no one cares anyway.  Facts and revenue and profits don't mean much to the SP when people are sick of something. But in the end run value will prevail, especially when SP gets overwhelmingly oversold.  Biontech is definitely oversold because no one recognizes the now proven potential of mRNA technology.  It just saved millions of lives didn't it???  mRNA technology will change medical science in a humanity changing way much sooner than the public understands-- the Wall St Squid know this, they are laying low, it's their secret.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "A buyout rumor would never happen.

Do you really want a horse hit answer from a 17 year old retard?\n\nManagement gets authorisation from shareholders to issue new shares, this means for example if there's a total share count of 100, they may be authorized to issue another 400 shares to a total of 500 shares. \nThey would sell shares either in a direct placement with an investor or publicly. \nFor the existing holders of the 100 shares this means that they hold now 1/500th of the company per share instead of 1/100th of the company per share.\nThe effect is called dilution. Effectively it reduces the intrinsic value per share (however for example if a company grows FCF by 100% per year and issues 10% new shares per year, the net FCF per share still goes up significantly and the stock price will likely rise despite the dilution = the overall value grows quicker than share count, hence share value increases; obviously the opposite happens if dilution hits a contracting company, then the value per share is decreased exponentially)\n\nFor the price the company gets for these shares it really depends on the market. For example if the company issues shares into a falling stock price, they do increase downward price pressure while during a rally the market may a sob the new stock without negative impact on the stock.\n\nMany companies have an pre-authorized potential of shares they can issue. For example, PLTR started at ca. 1bn has diluted to 2bn to date but has approval to issue another ca. 20bn shares.\n\nOn the other hand AMC pre squeeze had ca. 125m shares outstanding but had approved 500m. During the squeeze they have issued all shares possible to raise cash and avoid bankruptcy. When they requested shareholder to to issue more shares after that (to repay debt) the shareholders(=Apes) denied this request, thus the share count is still ca. 500m\n\nThe company (=management) needs shareholder approval for share issuance because it obviously directly affects shareholder value.", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "I appreciate the proper explanation.

What's ca?\n\nThanks!", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "There can be very good reasons for a capital increase.\n\n1. If the company has very good investment opportunities but not enough funding it makes sense for shareholders to inject more capital to accelerate the business. As long as the ratio between dilution versus value gain is positive, I.e. A doller diluted means more than one dollar value gain, this is a net gain for everyone.\n\nThis is the typical startup or exponential growth situation where a company cannot fund its growth through operational cash flows and isn't yet able to raise debt at reasonable rates.\n\n2. If a company is in distress and needs cash, especially if it cannot raise debt (at reasonable rates). Shareholders here may agree to dilution as the alternative is bankruptcy which normally means total loss for equity. Less severe Situation may arise where a company would be severely hurt if it cannot raise more funding so the benefit outweighs the downside for shareholders.\n\nPrime example is again AMC. It was severely overvalued in 2021 and management asked for increase in equity which would have enabled repayment of all debt for a ca. 25% dilution. Rationally shareholders should have agreed, because the benefit of being debt free would have out weigted the downside of the dilution. Especially as the stock value fell by more than 50% in the meantime, I.e. The shareholders have missed the opportunity to raise cash at far superior conditions.\n\nIn the end a issuance of shares makes sense for shareholders if net benefit > dilution. \n\nObviously there is a misaligned between management and shareholders here. Management ALWAYS wants more cash while shareholders should be critical if that increase in cash really boosts returns or whether management is just \"lazy\" in exploring non-dilutive alternatives(or just want to pay themselves a nice fat option package)\n\n500m = 500 million", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "How can the government print trillions of dollars and dilute your dollars worth?", "score": -1, "replies": [{"body": "I mean.

If you own 100 shares of FB and sell a Jan 2023 $250 covered call, you receive \\~$22 in credit (x100 shares), and it has a **delta** of 0.44 (more on this later). Now, one of 2 things will happen if you keep the play till expiration:\n\n1. FB is above $250 at expiration, so you will likely be forced to sell your shares (called away) for $250. You get to keep the $2200 you received initially, plus the profit from your purchase price to $250. Assuming you bought at $220, you make $3000 + $2200 - commissions. The stock only went up 13.6% but you made 23.6%. Not bad, huh?\n2. FB is below $250 at expiration. Congratulations, you keep your shares **and**  the credit. If FB is $220 at expiration, you got $2200 (10%) for a net move of $0. And with the $2200 credit, you got 10% downside protection for \"free\" (by staking your shares as collateral). If FB goes down to $200, you're not worried because you spend $22000 on shares and then got $2200 back, so you only paid $19800 for your shares in a way.\n\nNow if you sell a naked call and collect $2200 without the underlying shares, your risk is theoretically limitless, as the call seller must deliver on their promise. So if you wrote a $250 call and FB is trading at $300 on expiration, too bad. You will have to buy the stock for $300 and deliver it to the buyer for $250. Sure, you got the $2200 initially, but you had to spend $30000 on shares and sell them for $25000. Even with the credit, you're out $2800 :(. Of course if the stock doesn't hit $250 on expiration, you get $2200 for your risk.\n\nEnter our friend Delta, with a value of 0.44. This means that for every dollar the stock moves up, the value of that call you sold increases by $0.44, along with other factors that influence options price. So you can either short 44 shares of FB when you write the call to place downward pressure on the stock, or you can sell a put with offsetting -0.44 delta to remain delta-neutral. Let's say that's the $220 Jan 2023 put (-0.43 so close enough), which will give you $3100 in credit, so you're up $5500 to start. Now if you have to deliver the shares at $300 for $25000, you have your $5500 credit to at least break even.\n\nBut Delta increases the closer the underlying gets to the strike (thanks to its buddy Gamma). So as FB runs up to $250, or past it, you'll have to short more shares to keep your risk delta-neutral. And if you did the sold put, you'll want to buy it back to close it for quite a bit less than the $3100 you paid, since the delta of that put has crept towards 0 and the time value of the option has also decreased. Then you'll sell another put corresponding to your delta risk on the sold call at that time. Depending on how ugly the situation gets, you may have to do this multiple times. \n\nTL;DR: Someone selling a naked call has to short the underlying shares to keep downward pressure on price, or sell a put to offset their potential risk, and adjust as their risk increases.", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "🙌🙌🙌🙌", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Thanks for the responses - I see you’ve already helped folks.
