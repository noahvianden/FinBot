In 2022, they have a chance to come close to that production growth again(possibly exceed). Their revenue growth should be even higher (higher ASP due to more expensive environment + more S/X sold this year).\n\nThey tripled earnings last year and should double them this year (last year they tripled because their 2020 earnings were very low, this year they will double because their 2022 earnings will be high, if that makes sense).\n\nTesla has a chance to become the most profitable US headquartered automaker in 2022. \n\nSo looking at their P/E ratio, they are at currently at 151.5 trailing 12 month P/E. However trailing twelve month isn‚Äôt a great metric for someone growing so quickly. In 2022 they produced 180k cars in Q1 and 305k cars in Q4. Growth that rapid isn‚Äôt accurately modeled with TTM metrics because we are already so far ahead of where we were 12 months ago. \n\nSo instead using the forward P/E and estimating earnings of $11B in 2022 we have a P/E ratio of 75.8.  Looking forward to 2023 we should have pretty extreme growth due to the ramp up of new factories. That 2 year forward PE becomes something like 34x (probably lower) in my modeling. \n\nAs we are anticipating continuing enormous growth, that number is ridiculously low. Look at other tech company PE ratios and then look at their growth rates. You‚Äôll see there is no comparison.\n\nKeep in mind Tesla is making cars which cost 50x an iPhone with almost iPhone margins, in a market that is not saturated but only a couple of years old.\n\nAlso look into PEG ratio.

What risks did I overlook? Is my criteria above too risky or too conservative?\n\nYou can get 30% *average* (more than your 20-30%) by buying and holding UPRO.  You're probably taking on more risk than buying and holding UPRO too, so your strategy could be better when it's not beating index funds.  Best of all, with buy and hold you can get LTCGs which is nice when your account size is larger or you have a high 9 to 5 income.  It's also less work to just buy and hold.  Brokers will auto do it for you, so you can have it auto setup with a paycheck deposit so you don't even have to look at it.  Less of that dopamine thrill, but a lot more relaxing.\n\nMy advice: Only trade options if you have alpha.  The best alpha an options trader can get is the same alpha found in value investing.  Learn how to identify what stock is good and bad based on what company is good and bad.  Eg, COIN's initial statement to investors was blatant like, \"We're a scam, but here is our offering.\" level of obvious.  Anyone who had any basic level of value investing skill would have seen this and would be, \"This is a great time to short COIN at its IPO or wait a month and then sell calls against it until it dies.\" milking it.  Or HOOD, less obvious, but same sort of deal.  Or AMD, looking at the company's offerings when the Zen 2 came out made it obviously bullish.  Options lets you leverage seemingly anything up.  Only use options when you're sure of a direction and you can only be sure of a direction with value investing skills on companies or macroeconomic skills on the larger economy.\n\nLETFs will only let you level up index funds.  Though if you don't have the value investing alpha, index funds will pay you better in the long run, so again LETFs win if you don't have alpha, doubly this time.\n\nIn short, if this is the best you got, buy and hold UPRO.

It's where insurgencies can really thrive and a large, overwhelming conventional force loses its effectiveness due to social factors and the general makeup of the combat space.  Precision guided munitions and a foot presence becomes essential for rooting out resistance without collateral damage that can be used to further embolden and recruit for the insurgency force.   It's an entirely different form of combat and there are totally different strategies to approach it from. \n\nRussia has had plenty of opportunity to study and learn from afar how America's handling of this phase of combat has evolved.  There have been some incredibly painful lessons learned and some incredibly effective techniques developed that are unique to the modern battlefield.  They require  strong leverage from community relationships, Intel, and technology.  All things that by all appearances Russia is lacking in right now.  The only other feasible option is to go all out war, and to give the citizens warning and time to evacuate so only combatants are left within the battle space - but that's a tricky one to pull off in terms of avoiding an international humanitarian crisis and the political fallout with the way information passes these days. \n\nI expect we see a pause after it has been clearly established that Russia has Kiev dead to rights and some attempts at negotiation from this point.

I was in the Putin won't full scale invade and NATO won't militarily retaliate  camp because the costs would be too high for both sides.  Turns out I was half wrong and maybe half right.  \n\nThe longer this drags on for Russia the higher the costs become.   I don't understand it because it could be argued that technically NATO has already lost in that they wanted Ukraine to join and when the pressure was on they didn't step up militarily to defend.  This could have led to a shift in the perception of the NATO alliance and also resulted in Russia annexing eastern Ukraine- a win by all accounts for Russia.  I believe that outcome is still possible, but day by day it seems to slip further away.\n\nWhen I step back and reflect on my opinion of the circumstances I think I underestimated Putin's ambitions and overestimated Russia's ability to modernize their military.  It honest to God looks like the same military that I trained to fight mechanized battle against in the Fulda gap, and I had just assumed they'd learned from their own conflicts and from observing US Conflicts.  I would have thought that they would have invested in technological advancements but I guess I was mistaken. \n\nI still don't put it past Putin to either satisfice or pace and lead for a more obscure outcome, or to just have another trick up his sleeve, but going back to the beginning I'm 90% that this is where we find ourselves.

If NATO decides they have the opportunity they could push hard. The only trump card Russia has in this is their nukes. I really hope we can somehow take advantage and disarm them.

I'm not saying you should go away and read it since it's a moot point now. But that kind of analysis I think has a lot of value. He's the equivalent of the physio saying, *if you do the marathon this weekend you stand a very good chance of damaging your ligaments*.\n\nThere are a lot of variables at play, it's totally probabilistic, but it's probably the best epistemology we can get, all things considered.\n\nAnd you know, the Iran/US one is a good point, because Rob Lee wouldn't be the guy to go to here.

That Vladimir Putin, Russia‚Äôs president, can back his imperial ambitions with nuclear arms has taken a shooting war with¬†nato¬†off the table. Economic retaliation is the weapon of choice. One obvious move would be to cut Russian banks‚Äô access to¬†swift, a messaging network used by 11,000 banks in 200 countries to make cross-border payments. Some Western governments favour pressing the co-operatively owned¬†swift¬†into cutting Russia off, but others do not. For now the measure remains off the list of sanctions outlined by the West. Why the reluctance?\n\nThere are three reasons. Start with the impact on Russia. The Kremlin has been bracing itself for the possibility of being cut off from¬†swift¬†since 2014, when America floated the idea as punishment for the invasion of Crimea. Exclusion would trigger capital flight and a run on firms and banks reliant on foreign funding, but coping mechanisms would soon kick in. Russian banks and their foreign partners would use other means of communication. And transactions would migrate en masse to¬†spfs, a Russian alternative to SWIFT that is not nearly as ubiquitous and sophisticated, but still usable.

Cutting Russia off from¬†swift¬†could make it harder for international buyers to pay for its energy supplies; it could also prompt Russian retaliation.\n\nLast, using¬†swift¬†as a weapon against Russia could hurt long-term American interests. America holds sway over international finance thanks to the dollar‚Äôs dominance and its pre-eminent role in global settlement systems. Further politicising¬†swift¬†would give China an incentive to bolster¬†cips, its rival to¬†swift¬†for cross-border payments in yuan. It would also help China court any country with uneasy relations with America looking for alternatives. It already counts some big foreign banks as members. By late 2021 it had a daily average volume of transactions of 310bn yuan ($50bn)‚Äîwell behind¬†swift‚Äôs estimated $400bn but nearly double the volume of a year before.\n\nOther weapons of economic disruption are at hand.
