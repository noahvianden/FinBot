{"title": "What Actually Just Happened To $AMD", "selftext": "Since most of you don't seem to be getting it, I'll explain.\n\nThere's a month old rumor that AMD was diversifying its manufacturing by adding Samsung fabs to the mix.  The contract amendment they just announced is very likely confirmation of that rumor.  And it's a good thing for AMD.  I say \"likely\" because it *could* just mean they're going to use TSMC more.  Either way, it's still good for AMD.\n\nAMD has a Wafer Supply Agreement with GlobalFoundries that locks them into building most of their products in GloFo's fabs.  In exchange, they get better prices and yield guarantees.  Basically this allows GloFo to absorb the cost of ramping a new production node, because they know AMD is going to keep coming back for more business.\n\nHowever, that presents problems if they max out GloFo's capacity.  The new deal, which cost AMD $100M in cash (split over four quarters) and $235M in a warrant granted to GloFo's sister holding company, allows them to \"step out\" with another fab to increase production volume.\n\nThere's one and only one reason Lisa Su would pay GloFo $335M to gain access to third-party fabs, and it's not because AMD is about to go bankrupt.  It's because AMD is about to exceed GloFo's production capabilities by producing tons of Polaris, Zen and Vega chips.\n\nThe stock price may be a roller-coaster ride for a while, but this is great news for the long term.  I'm looking for the nadir to buy a ton of calls.\n\nAnd, by the way, if you think this means AMD is going bankrupt, please explain why GloFo accepted most of it's payment in a stock warrant and why that warrant has a value of $235M with a $5.98 exercise price.

This supposed \"power efficiency\" only exists when comparing performance-per-watt with DX11 games.  Compare with DX12 (the platform AMD has been designing for for the better part of a decade now) and it vanishes into the ether.  This is a difference of architecture, not the lithography used, plain and simple.\n\n> (The process size is of course a bit of a misnomer but still) and regarding a niche product, that would be the better scenario if GloFo is indeed having issues as I would rather the niche product be the one with issues then a mainstream product such as zen, and being this late in the game it is very unlikely that zen will be switched to Global Foundries.\n\nIDEK what you're trying to say here.  Zen is being produced at GloFo.  There's no \"switching it to\" them.  This allows them to plan for capacity elsewhere and even spin up production while keeping costs in check.  And this rampant speculation about \"issues\" with GloFo's process is made up of pure fanboy delusions.\n\n> Also AMD very well could pay that price for Vega if they are trying to push market share in the higher performance GPU market, and that is largely the current plan, increase market share.\n\nAgain ... what?  They could pay what price for what reason?  Speak English, man!\n\n>  Of course it doesn't let them plan to screw GloFo, but if they are having issues with the GloFo process that would not exactly be planned.\n\nNow it's just obvious you don't understand the WSA.  If there were problems with GloFo's process, it was already addressed by the WSA and wouldn't need this modification.  Prior to this modification of the contract, AMD only paid GloFo for minimum yields.  So if GloFo's process wasn't delivering acceptable yields, AMD got reductions in the price of wafers to make up for it.\n\nThere's nothing but good news for AMD in this.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": ">They can plan to soak up every bit of GloFo's available production capacity and fill their excess demand with orders from Samsung or TSMC\n\n\nThat was already allowed for since the original agreement in 2009, no need for a new agreement.\n\n>This supposed \"power efficiency\" only exists when comparing performance-per-watt with DX11 games.\n\n\nI was having difficulty finding any benchmarks that isolated power consumption with DX 12 but notice this(https://www.techpowerup.com/reviews/AMD/RX_480/22.html) where the 1080 only consumes 3 more watts under general gaming and 20 at maximum.

My comment was purely in respect to why they would be paying for the privilege(*edit: the privilege to produce chips elsewhere even when GloFo may have the capacity to produce the chips*), and actually I was ruling out issues with zen here, as if they were having issues with GloFo there would be delays while switching to TMSC, which there are not.\n\n\n>They could pay what price for what reason?\n\n\nfor the privilege to produce Vega chips at TMSC as apposed to GloFo. ie they are paying money so that they could produce Vega chips at TMSC rather than GloFo in order to produce a higher quality chip that competes with Nvidia's high end chips to take back market share.\n\n\n>So if GloFo's process wasn't delivering acceptable yields, AMD got reductions in the price of wafers to make up for it.\n\n\nIt appears this was an amendment in 2011, whereby they only pay for good chips.

I concede I was misinformed on this point.\n\n\nEDIT:\n\n\n>process is made up of pure fanboy delusions\n\n\nI prefer AMD, I use an MSI r9 280 and if you go through my subs you will notice I am subbed to r/amd and r/AyyMD/ if anything I'm an AMD fanboy that is worried for AMD's future.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "No, the agreement didn't allow that, at least not in the same way.
