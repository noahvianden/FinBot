{"title": "I was once straight. Hear me out.", "selftext": "WSB,\n\nI suck dicks for a living from my home. You can call me a \"professional faggot\" if you want I guess, but I would never label myself that way, I'm just someone who's managed to survive his autistic journey and make it to the 'consistent dick-sucking' stage. For transparency sake, I'll say this right now, I'm not straight. I'm 24 years old and my liquid assets total only around 600 tendies. I keep a modest dildo collection of 260 and withdraw any rusted cocks at the end of the month over that number. I've survived my faggot journey and I was able to achieve consistency using my 260 dildos to pull out 100-110 dicks per year from my ass. It's not a huge amount and I'm sure many of you store more dildos than me, but with my 100 tendies allowance I'm able to live comfortably, provide for my autistic children, and spend 3 hours per day 'working' and the rest of my time doing activities and hobbies I enjoy (sucking dicks). I go rimming a lot. My tendie asset size grows every year thus slowly but surely I take more and more dicks with each new year. I increase the amount of dildos I allocate for anal self-stimulation (how many dildos I can keep in my asshole) by 5% every 6 months or so.   \n\nNot too long ago (maybe ~5 years back) I was once like many of you. I had a tiny dick, and I blew homeless guys in back alleys hoping for big black cocks and once in a while sucked a few good dicks but it seemed like I always ended up sucking AIDS-ridden lepers for 50 cents a pop to make ends meet. For some reason back then I could never achieve consistency. \n\nI would suck dicks based off ads in dirty bathrooms or what other people told me, I would suck dicks based off free drinks or the promise of a Big Mac, I would cup the balls, but my methods were always random, and as a result my consistency was always random.\n\nI'm writing this post because a week ago I decided to visit WSB again for the first time in a very long time and see what was going on. I was seeing faggots making the same mistakes I used to make, having the same issues I used to have, people taking micro dicks with chlamydia, and for what? There's no reason any of you should suck sub-par dicks if you can take the time to plan and learn how to suck them properly.\n\nHere are a few things I learned over the years that helped me achieve dick-sucking nirvana and that could help some of you out as well.\n\n1. Always cup the balls. Why would you ever suck a dick without cupping? That's your shield, your one and only defense against the millions of faggot whores out there trying to take your money. Your ball-cupping should be wide enough to fully grip the entire sack, but tight enough that should your man begin to convulse with pleasure you can keep a tight grip. It hurts when you're sucking that dick and he just won't come, but more often than not, your ball-cupping will get you out early if you're pressed for time. Remember Lance Bass, for example? Because of well placed ball-cupping I was able to convert him from semi-straight to fully gay. **I cupped his balls based on the length of his balls and sack. Multiply testicle length by 2 and use that as your primary cupping width.** If sack length goes more than 300% beyond testicle length (typically this will be 100-200% for most 'normal length' cocks) there's no need to baghold the testes, just cut it and move on to the next one.\n\n2. Learn how to take a dick like a fucking man. If a faggot ever tells you he's never sucked a dick - RUN. Run as fast as you can in the other direction. They're bullshitting you. No dick is perfect, and you will taste bad ones, exactly in the same fashion that a butcher has to pay for his meat, or a farmer has to pay for seeds. However your good dicks will outnumber your bad dicks vastly if you learn to cup balls early and let winners run (using a trailing stop of course).\n\n3. This is the most important one. Relax the jaw to deep throat. I want you to think about a snake. There’s a saying that “if you want to suck a dick like a champion, you need to guzzle that shit in the back of your throat.” This has a lot to do with practice. A dick won’t fit every single time, every now and then you'll have to surrender to a customer who won a genetic jackpot, had a couple Viagra pills, or forgot to groom his giant bush. **But a dick-sucking faggot is an extremely profitable business, so where’s the money come from? Well it comes from deep-throating. A faggot doesn’t need to deepthroat every time to make money, it just needs to deepthroat most of the time** - say 55-60% of the time. This means that across a large enough sample size, across all the faggots, a faggot whore will still come out on top, because their edge in deep-throating allows them to keep more profits than they lose.  Your dick-sucking should be meticulous and consistent much like OP's mom. You chose an edge (whether it’s licking the tip, tickling the balls, or swirling your tongue) that you know gives you a high probability of winning, and you take that edge, **with the same exact position size and entry method every single time. If you are disciplined enough to do this, and if your deep-throating is truly an edge in dick-sucking, then you will see a slowly increasing customer base.** You will lose some customers, but across a large enough sample size, doing the exact same sucking with the exact same position over and over will result in consistent and reliable profitability from the faggots. \n\n4. Take on the right dick size. Aim small, miss small. **One of the biggest mistakes new faggot whores make is taking on dick sizes too large for their mouth and throat.** Think about it, would you rather suck 10 NBA player dicks for $5,000, or 10,000 normal-sized dicks for $100,000? Sucking 10 NBA player dicks for $5,000 leaves no room for error. It’s all or nothing. Every dick that goes against you will cause an emotional response that can cause you to abandon your plan and bail out of a good dick-sucking early. Meanwhile, sucking smaller dicks for less money per dick to get the $100,000 account is stress-free because your dick size is small compared to those gargantuan 10-inchers, and if the dick is disease-ridden you are not affected as severely by the loss. Remember to choose your dick size appropriately so that as discussed above, your edge in deep-throating has enough time to work itself out over a large sample size. **The last thing we want is you to vomit on a famous dude's dick because it's too huge.** Recommended dick sizes differ with every person, I have seen people trade with extremely conservative numbers such as 4.5 inches of total dick per faggot, all the way up to the bigger risk takers staking 6.5 or 7.5 inches on a single dick. Do the math and figure out what dick size works best for your situation.\n\n5. Always collect cash up front. Before you even think about locking yourself in that back room, you should already know 1. Why you are sucking this dick? 2. Is this a rational reason to suck this dick and does it yield a high probability of cash pay? 3. What is my entry strategy, am I relaxing the jaw first and going straight for the deep-throat or cupping the balls, or both? 4. Does this dude have any warts or open sores around his shaft? 5. What will be my cash-taking strategy, and how much do I expect to make off this sucking? Will I collect it all up front, or do I trust him with half? At what length of time will I give up finishing him? Dick-sucking without a plan can have devastating effects and introduces human emotion and impulse into the equation. When it comes to sucking dicks, human emotion and impulse are two extremely detrimental things. If we blow dudes with a pre-determined plan we limit our chances to horrible STI situations and poor dick experiences.\n\n6. Don't over suck. Sucking too much can hurt you more than you know. As faggots it’s crazy to think that realistically, 70% of our day is spent waiting for pants and briefs to unfold, and 30% is spent actually initiating the dick-sucking, deep-throating, or cleaning up the cum. Some days we don’t take any dicks because we don’t see any good dicks in the field. **Your best chance for success is to pick 2 or 3 frequent customers and wait patiently for them to show themselves on your doorstep. If you don’t see a good dick you like, don't accept the offer, simple as that.** And when a good dick setup does occur, you should already have a plan for how you’ll be sucking that dick. **Dick-sucking should be boring like factory work. If you want entertainment or thrills, go to Disneyland.**\n\n7. Your job as a faggot should be first and foremost to protect your mouth and throat from possible damage and loss, only once you have done that can you begin to think about making any money in the dick-sucking market. If you end up remembering just one thing after reading all the information, please remember this quote: “Amateurs focus on slobbering giant knobs. Professionals focus on taking average dicks with perfect form.”\n\nOver the past few years I've literally done the same dick-sucking setup over and over: The Marilyn Monroe executed on Daily or Weekly sucks. Mastering my setup and taking it with the exact same dick size every time, the same deep-throating, and cash pay up front has allowed me to see a steadily rising revenue curve with only the minor draw-downs due to my infatuation with dildos and tendies. If your 1 chosen setup doesn't appear in a customer, just don't suck that day. You don't have to suck dick every single day to be a successful faggot.\n\nSuck dick with the same amount of effort each time no matter how confident you feel \"this time\" or how good the shaft looks right now. Chose whichever setup works best for you, I personally use the Marilyn Monroe and do it over and over again. If your setup is truly an edge in customer satisfaction you'll see a steadily rising revenue curve over time, and you too can achieve dick-sucking nirvana. **Remember: Ignore the homophobes and follow the money.**\n\nIf you want a good book or two to read, these 3 have helped me vastly in developing myself into a consistent faggot:\n\nBall-cupping for Beginners - Mark Douglass\n\nDisciplined Sucking - Mark Douglass\n\nMastering the Deepthroat (2012 version not 2005) - John F. Carter\n\nI realize many of you are on a budget or just starting out your faggot journey, you can easily find Mark Douglass' books for free in PDF form online. John Carter's book is around $40 on Amazon, but it is easily worth it's weight in tendies.\n\nGood luck.\n\nEdit: Buy NVDA", "id": "53p4gz", "created_utc": 1474399564.0, "score": 3863, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 288, "comments": [{"body": "Jesus.

But a casino is an extremely profitable business, so where’s the money come from? Well it comes from probability. A casino doesn’t need to win every time to make money, it just needs to win most of the time - say 55-60% of the time. This means that across a large enough sample size, across all the jackpots, black jack 21’s, and royal flushes, a casino will still come out on top, because their edge in probability allows them to keep more profits than they lose.\"\n\nI'm not going to post the link but you can google that block of text and find his newsletter, which is where 80% of it comes from, minus the bullshit intro about being a professional trader.\n\nGodspeed.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "That is some top tier knob gobblin analysis buddy.", "score": 10, "replies": []}, {"body": "[MAKE HIM A MOD](https://youtu.be/ok5FsgkybrE?t=44)", "score": 8, "replies": []}, {"body": "Holy shit this is gold.
