So to a company like a Ford or a BMW, teams working on EV are not treated as \"business critical\".  \n\nThis may affect the prestige of working on those teams, the engineers that they can attract from within and externally, the amount of capital that they choose to expend, how they react to setbacks.\n\nFurthermore, they may not have the internal engineering expertise to do EV and/or are in the process of acquiring that talent so there is a hurdle that they have to overcome to catch up.  And it's not just the engineering; it's also the marketing, design, infrastructure design (retrofit or build new factories, new lines), new suppliers, etc.\n\nFor Tesla, it's EV or bust so all of their operations are focused on that paradigm.  From how they hire engineers, whom they hire, how they structure their teams, etc.  The paradigm difference can't be ignored as it affects how the people within these companies operate.

Any other trades that happen on the market day to day are between investors/traders. \n\nAs to the impact it has on the company, that tends to be very little. CEOs often get bonuses for a high stock price and stock option packages are very common for many positions. CEOs also have to fear getting fired by their shareholders when the company doesn't turn out to be a great investment. Since CEOs have to report their performance once per quarter, this is widely seen as encouraging very short term focused behavior.\n\nAlso, companies tend to borrow money to fund their operations. Having a big market cap can make it easier to borrow, though lenders aren't blind and will evaluate the company's health themselves. Last but not least, a higher price means that the company can get more money when they issue new shares.
