People are kicking around historical Shiller P/E averages, but there is no reason to think that average is the \"correct\" average and any upward deviation means a bubble.  To the contrary, I would expect the overall P/E ratio to increase over time as more money flows in to capital markets.  We've had a tremendous flattening of access to capital markets in the last several decades.  \n\nCheck it out:[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/D9ZxZXX.jpg)\n\nI plotted the historical Shiller P/E back to 1900 and then also a 20-year trailing average starting in 1920 and then applied a simple linear trendline to both.  Note the long-term cyclic nature of the 20-year trailing average, but note also that it is trending decidedly up.  Also note the upward trend of the P/E, and how sharp deviations above that trend do indeed tend to correct quickly (e.g. 1929, 2000).  The graph actually cuts off a little bit before 2016, but we are actually right around the long-term trendline right now and still a bit under the trailing 20-year average.  In any case, you can clearly see that, despite the longer term ups and downs, the P/E is clearly headed up.  A much better metric for \"over valued\" might be measuring the divergence of the shiller P/E from the trailing 3,5, or 10 year average, as this will give some context to the number, relative to data that includes pre-industrial market prices and earnings. \n\nThink about this: 50+ years ago, only rich \"sophisticated\" people had substantial sums invested in the market.  Nowadays, pretty much every white-collar full-timer has a 401k.  Combine that with massive increases in societal wealth and living standards and you have more people putting more money into capital markets.  Why *shouldn't* the price of those things go up, relative to their historic earnings?\n\nAlso: you can't just look at stocks in a vacuum.
