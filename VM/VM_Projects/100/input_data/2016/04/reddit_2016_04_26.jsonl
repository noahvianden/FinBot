I realize your hard work and hard-on for this company and it's possible growth. I also sat through the mundane pep rally that was supposed to make us, well informed (thanks to you) investors, all warm and fuzzy about their future outlook. What I can't get past, and in your famous words, \"time will tell\", is that they're hiring their own sales force to 'educate the doctors and patients' on how their product should be used. Like it's an alien fucking concept?! I get that Sanfri screwed the pooch. I get that their big announcement was talk of a future expansion globally to appease the doomsayers and an initiative to provide an education to those, state-side, who already have a negative opinion of the product. What I didn't hear was a relevant plan for either of those things to take place. An additional 50-70 Mannkind employees in the US' largest markets? Another group of pill slingers walking into doctors offices after the Sanfri rep, or whoever else has the bigger tits just left, trying to peddle another product that ALREADY FAILED? Are these the managers they said they were hiring? Where does the training come from? Where is the training conducted? Travel expenses for 70 people state side add up. Who foots the bill for that? Tax write off? How much are they paid? Is it competitive? It could spell disaster if their reps are met by the other drug reps that say, 'you make HOW MUCH?! Shit girl, we make TWICE that, you're getting fucked'. THAT is your bottom line. THAT is what sells your product. Yea, cut out all of that, put together a Super Bowl ad and rake it in. Have a few reps to 'educate' on how to use a fucking inhaler or, put out a fucking memo to the doctors, FDA, pharmacists, etc on how to use it and sell your shit. People today don't want an EDUCATION on how to take their drugs. They want to take their drugs, feel better, know that they're safe for the next however long and repeat. I'm fucking long on them only to get myself out of my pride for dealing with this shit and I may buy more tomorrow to average down depending on where it goes. Butt, FUCK this is a God damned gamble of the highest order.. /u/xbonerdetective, you're an asshole, go fuck yourself, and I hope you're right. I hope May 9th brings something better than bankruptcy.
