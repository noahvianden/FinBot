Autopilot has not hurt Tesla yet, but the thing is that lawsuits could have happened and still have the potential to happen. Lawsuits are expensive, even if you win.\n\nInsane/Ludicrous speed is perfectly achievable by other luxury automakers. BMW, Lexus, Mercedes could easily build an electric motor that does the same things as the Model S. It's a real risk to Tesla. The only reason these companies haven't done so is because it's a losing proposition right now.

By doing so, Tesla can claim that they turn a profit on every car sold.\n\nHowever, as I am sure you'll agree, that is an unrealistic scenario.
