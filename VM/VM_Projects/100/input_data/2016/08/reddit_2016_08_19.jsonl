Such an offering even 20% lower priced will generate large returns. You must remember Intel has huge FAB costs and they can't bribe OEMs anymore like they did in the early 2000s with Athlon64/x2. They have to play by the rules. They also have share holders that expect dividens and certain returns they can't just go slashing prices willy nilly. AMD is much more nimble now.\n\nAll Zen has to do is be competitive not beat Intel. Even a small 10% market share in CPU will push AMD with it's relatively small open shares (700m AMD, vs 4bil intel) to 20PPS.

Their GPUs are not winning Nvidia hand over fist but they are competitive now, coupled with cheaper Freesync monitor vs G-Sync and Vulkan+DX12 wins the RX line has been solid in sales. Licensing now with China is also bringing in much greater funds with the allowance of more IP work. Lastly Apple is eyeing the RX line for their computers and Vulkan is their best hope of bringing gaming to Apple. If AMD can be competitive with Intel in offering Apple might just maybe maybe consider Zen over Intel. Apple CPU win is purely speculative as Intel may just undercut the shit out of AMD but it's possible if AMD can pull off a ZEN/RX APU that makes Intel CPUs with Intel HD look like a joke! Apple consumers don't care much about the CPU as was evident with the POWERPC lines. Apple however is looking for more margins to keep their crazy stock price up.\n\nFINALLY AMD has the ability to compete with Nvidia on the deeplearning side of things. AMD GPUs from a hardware perspective are stronger than NVIDIA. however the software drivers suck for AMD on launch.
