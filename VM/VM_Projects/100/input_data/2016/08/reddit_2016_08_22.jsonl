So ... uh ... duh?\n\n> I'm just not sold on it. The big zen chip everyone is talking about is still likely going to be behind intel on performance.\n\nDo you have a point?  AMD doesn't need to take the performance crown, though their 32c server beast certainly has the potential to do exactly that in the market that matters the most.  All they need to do is bend down the price:performance curve.  Major customers have been going to such desperate measures as trying to build ARM servers to stop Intel from raping them with high margins, and they'll gladly buy AMD to fuel competition in that sector.  And how is it, exactly, that you've calculated what's \"likely\" given that the only actual benchmark we've seen shows them beating Intel's current top of the line CPU in IPC?\n\n> Everybody is gushing about how it's 14nm while ignoring that intel has had a 14nm chip since 2014 and is supposedly going to 10nm next year.\n\nWho's everybody?  No one (except EE nerds) gives a shit about the lithography used.  The only thing that matters is performance and power draw.  And Zen has demonstrably closed those gaps.  Maybe 10nm will change that in Intel's favor, but given the not-very-impressive gains from going down to 14nm, I'm not convinced.  How much you gain with each node reduction reduces logarithmically.\n\n> It's similar with GPUs, nVidia is still king on performance, and looks to stay that way. Just look at pcmasterrace, they almost all have nvidia chips.\n\nYeah, 'cause PCMasterRace is representative of the average GPU buyer.  Did you even read these idiotic arguments before you repeated them from whatever Nvidia porn blog you were jerking off to pictures of Jen-Hsun Huang on before you came here?  Again, who holds the performance crown doesn't make shit's worth of difference to the stock price.  AMD gained GPU market share in Q1 and started turning a profit on their GPU segment in Q2 which doesn't count Polaris revenues.\n\nSo, let's tally it up:\n\n1.  Consistent Semi-Custom wins, continuing into the present quarter with both major consoles re-launching (guaranteed Q3 revenues, might as well be money in the bank) and an unannounced mystery project.\n2.  GPU sector growth (both professional and desktop) from previous product lines, bolstered by Apple using AMD GPUs exclusively, combined with the recent release of a brand new GPU line that they're still struggling to keep on the shelves and the highly likely \"rumor\" that Apple is eating it up (based on a design win from last year).\n3.  Limitless potential to scale into high margin HEDT and server markets with Zen, with the deck quite literally stacked in their favor by the last five years of Intel's monopoly, bolstered by far better iGPUs than Iris Pro and a single, scalable design that keeps fabrication costs low.\n4.  Well positioned to be a player in a very \"hot\" emerging market:  VR.\n\nThe only negatives are a large debt ($2b, vs $1b cash on hand) and shitty fundamentals graphs due to the last 5 years of sucking.

After the release it turned out that the CPUs performed marginally worse on release than their previous lineup of CPUs.\n\nTo add insult to injury Intel's Sandy Bridge architecture came out later that year and smashed Bulldozer to pieces in benchmarks. AMD was almost entirely kicked out of the server and datacenter market after that happened. The consumer market has followed suit as well. AMD processors simply cannot compete with Intel's processors. \n\nBack around when this happened AMD had a stock price almost identical to what it is now. After release it plummeted. This time it's even worse for AMD since they spent so much on their new architecture. AMD hired a bunch of moonshot engineers, like Jim Keller, to rebuild their CPU architecture from the ground up for Zen.\n\nIBM and Intel dominate the professional market now, and the consumer market isn't much better for AMD.

It'll be worse than what happened with Fiji, especially if Nvidia rolls out a 1080 ti just to curb stomp AMD for the fuck of it.\n\nWe all know Zen isn't bulldozer in terms of a performance flop, if it was the company would have kept the project under wraps and soaked the R&D blood, since if they released another bulldozer the company would just straight hang itself. The problem is that because their market share and prospects are so much worse than they were around the time of Bulldozer that they *absolutely cannot make mistakes*.

He probably has minimum payments to make on 9K every month.  But none of this factors in margin maintenance.\n\nEvery time his stock drops below initial investment in a time period, he has to match 25% of up to ~4K on a margin call.  If he doesn't pay, no biggie, the broker sells enough shares to meet the margin call (but he's \"loo-zing\", not \"winning!\").  He kind of wants to get out as soon as he can, rather than keep risking margin calls.  \n\nHe's looks to be punching out soon after this october, when earnings reports get released.  If AMD numbers looks good, the stock price will rise.  (And the margin call is pushed off, or he can reduce his margin.)  Also, the new Zen chip gets released in Q3 or Q4, and Sony(?) has already committed to purchase Zen chips.  (For the initial run of its new console platform.)  Short term, everything points to the stock price moving up.\n\nDepending on when he plans to punch out (say 40%), he should definitely be in the black.  But if he gets greedy, and figures to ride it all the way to 100% of his initial investment, he risks never seeing that number, and losing to the point of 0% gain, or going rockbottom, and have 9K to pay off after 21 months (but the initial investment getting wiped out months earlier in margin calls).\n\nHere is his problem.  Look at AMD's 5 year price [history](http://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMD).  He bought at close to AMD's highest valuation in 5 years.  There hasn't been a significant drop in price all year.  \n\nSo when does he punch out?  If he rides the dragon, he can crash and burn real bad.  If he plays it safe, he makes a significant profit, but The Man (& perhaps Man Jr.) takes 36% of that.  (If he can hold off selling for 12+ months, the bite is reduced to 15% capital gains tax.)  But a 40% accrual is only $2.98x1750=$5215.  And then the federal gov't takes a ~36% bite out of that.  Its not yolo money.  You can't even buy a good 32' sailing yacht with that; more like a 21' daysailer.\n\nIt seems pretty reckless to make that kind of bet, given the potential downsides.  But short term, it looks like a sure $3.3K.  Long term looks good too if he bails soon after october 2017.  He keeps 21% more profit, and the stock still looks good to double his original investment.  But he bought the stock high.

I respect your move because it takes balls, although you're an idiot, at least you're the brave kind idiot who is too stupid to be afraid rather than the cowardly kind who is too stupid to be brave.  \n\nIf you have options trading capability, my recommendation is to sell monthly calls against the stock. The $9 strike for AMD @ October is currently trading @ $0.43. You can sell ~10-12 against your 1750 shares, keep the rest floating. It will at least protect you from some downside risk, if you close out the trade @ 9 by October, you'll have made ~25% of your investment, if AMD goes down, at least you'll mitigate some of the losses by 5% on 1000-1200 shares. \n\nIf AMD floats somewhere between 7-9 then you collect the premium at the very least.\n\nWhat's your exit point? If you're really smart my advice to you is to sell the covered calls, and use the premiums to buy ATM puts... Unfortunately AMD doesn't have November expiry... Which is bullshit looks like the next month after Oct is Jan 17, but the premiums aren't exorbitant considering how volatile the stock has been.. The 7 dollar strike puts are good, your max loss will be capped @ ~1000 or less if you sell the call as well for $9... then if it hits 9 before Jan, you can exit the position and walk away with (1.5*1750+17*43-17*90) = ~1800, or 18% gains, which isn't bad at all, and makes it a safer bet. If AMD falls below 4-5 I think you'll get margin called and wiped out... Of course you can ignore my advice because hedging will eat into those AMAZING YOLO GAINS WHEN AMD ROCKETS TO 20 BUCKS BY END OF THIS MONTH DUH. \n\nThis will turn it into a stupid, yolo investment that can ruin you for life or a relatively secure bet that will allow you to sleep at night with a 20-40% upside if you continue to sell calls as the stock is rising up.\n\nI don't know much about the stock though besides the fact that it was trading under $2 earlier this year.
