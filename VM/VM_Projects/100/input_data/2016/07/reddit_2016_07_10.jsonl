You grow up in that environment, you go to a school where the majority of teachers don't care or worse, are substitutes who don't care and don't know the subject to boot. Your nom gets cancer. You \"graduate.\" You get a shitty job in retail making $10/hr. Now despite your shitty life you just happen to be motivated. So you work hard, you get promoted. You now make $13/hr. You are now 21. Your mom dies. There's no money, she had no insurance no house etc. You need an apartment, quick. After health insurance and taxes you are making 1200 a month. You find a shithole apt in the ghetto with a roommate for 750, (375 each) You eat cheap shitty food but still groceries for yourself are 160/mo. Gas averages out to $50/mo. Electric 20. You have a shitty prepaid phone 30/mo. You needs car to get to work. 200/mo. You are young, you need full coverage due to loan, 200 month. You have to go to the laundrymat 30 month. You have to put gas in your car $80 month. So you are at 1145. $55 left over without ever investing in 401k and getting to take advantage your company match, or investing in stock through an ESPP, without having a single beer with your friends to reflect on your crappy life, without wifi to play video games, without cable etc, without even yet furnishing your apt. with out any other unforseen problems happening.

You go hiking. You fall and break your ankle. Even with insurance you end up with over 10k in medical bills. You miss work. Fortunately you have std but it only pays 2/3 of what you make. You lose your part time job. You get a credit card to get you through the 3 months out of work.... You default on your car loan and it gets repo'd ... Your credit score goes down to 550. And so it goes. This is how real life works for poor people. They don't have time to sit and just think about making life better.
