But if I'm confused by the market, it's probably not the market's fault. I just don't know what else, specifically, to think is going on here.\n\nOne trading paradigm I've read about in some older books is that you don't watch the news, you watch the market's reaction to the news. To give an example, if something terrible happens to a company in the news, but they keep trading strong despite this, that shows the market has assessed the fundamentals of the company and found them compelling. If something great happens to a company but its stock declines or continues to decline, that means the company is not actually doing well. Basically, the idea is that the value of information gotten directly with any specific piece of news pales in comparison to the value of all the rest of the information that can be estimated by watching how other market participants react to that news.\n\nUsing this paradigm is kind of like being a blind man who has adapted to see via echolocation. When using this concept you would try to understand market activity by figuring out what sound waves rebound against, rather than listening to their specifics. It's a little bit like the idiot strategy of just betting on trends, except that you only do so when the trends exist despite news that seems counterintuitive for the trend's existence. Events in the news are significant because they tell us that traders are paying more attention to a certain stock, not because they tell us everything about the stock we need to know to predict its price direction.\n\nAnyway, I don't know how much I believe in this paradigm, but it would say that if Netflix suddenly does badly in a way that seems like an unreasonable reaction to the news, that's a sign something else relatively more hidden is going wrong with the company. Even if this isn't the right answer, I still think something more is probably going on here than me inexplicably being zounds smarter than the rest of the market. The opposite happens a lot more often.\n\nIf you feel strongly that a bounce won't happen, though, can you explain why?
