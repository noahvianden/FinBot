My AMD play was 3 times as many calls as puts, both at $5 strike. Sold 1/3 of the calls yesterday (too good to pass up a chance to lock in some profit), so now I have twice as many calls as I do puts. My reasoning is if AMD beats, it'll have limited upside, if it misses it will go in to free fall. So my break even on that (not including the calls I sold yesterday) would be for the puts get 100% profit or the calls to get 50% of the profit. Tomorrow, I will sell my calls fir hopefully more than a 50% profit, but probably hold the puts (I'm planning on them expiring worthless so if AMD drops later before my expiration, I still can squeeze a bit more out of them, adding to my profit, since I've already basically realized them to be worthless). \n\nLook up ratio spreads, strangles, straddles, etc. \n\nIf you own a stock or are shorting it, you can buy/sell options to hedge as well.
