{"title": "WSB, what have you learned since you started following WSB?", "selftext": "Saturday night is the BEST time to post about stocks...\n\nPersonally, [sometimes the hard way,] I've learned:  \n\n1) If I want to short something, I will only short it if I expect it to drop *this week*.  If I think the time horizon is further than 1 week, I am better off holding the cash and waiting for the drop to re-enter a long position.  \n\n2)  'tis better to react to market overreactions than to try to predict market reactions.  The reality is these motherfuckers don't always react rationally.  And on top of that, their irrationality can cause you to do the opposite of what makes sense, to protect yourself.  e.g. You bet long on positive ER, and market reacts by dropping the price, so you sell out of fear, only to realize the price rebounds after a day or two.  Shit is crazy.  Be patient and wait for the crazy.  Recognize the crazy.  React intelligently to the crazy.  \n\n3)  Estimate what the market has already priced in vs. the probability of it happening.  E.g. Brexit and every ER ever.  If the market fully expects one result and therefore you expect no market reaction to it occurring, than you should evaluate the low-probability bet relative to the expected payout.  Example 1) If 80% of people expect AAPL to have shitty earnings after they just reduced guidance in a low-activity quarter, the likelihood AAPL misses guidance is lower than 50% because they had just taken the opportunity to reduce guidance last quarter.  No product launches = predictable forecast = AAPL is going to hit their guidance.  Go long.  Duh.  Example 2) Everyone expects Bremain i.e. the S&P goes up sharply prior to the vote, maybe short that shit because if Brexit, than huge drop.  If Bremain, than nothing changes.   \n\nThese all seem like no-brainers, but I guarantee MFers make these mistakes all the time due to biases.  \n\n\nWhat have you learned?", "id": "4vfdhw", "created_utc": 1469934143.0, "score": 142, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 169, "comments": [{"body": "As much as I suck at trading/investing, there are people a lot worse than me", "score": 180, "replies": [{"body": "My initial investment was $200 (broke college student).
