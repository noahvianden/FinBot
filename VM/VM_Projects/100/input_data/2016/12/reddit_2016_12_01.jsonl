{"title": "$FNMA & $FMCC - Best Execution Strategy & a Crash Course in Capital Structure", "selftext": "Ladies & Gentlemen -\n\nYesterday, /u/keepwinning provided you with an excellent thread on $FNMA. He also provided you with excellent DD 30 days ago. Had you followed his advice, you would have gained 150%. Over the last 30 days /u/keepwinning and I have had some excellent conversation on how to trade this.\n\nIn good /r/wallstreetbets fashion, no one followed his advice. Instead, /r/wallstreetbets waited for the news, a 40% one day gain to ask, \"Should I buy tomorrow at the open?\"\n\nI am hear to help answer that question for you by explaining [capital structure](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalstructure.asp) and best execution.\n\nThere are three types of equity securities with the GSEs. The Senior Preferred, Junior Preferred, and Common Stock (listed in order of hierarchy in the capital structure). If the common stock is worth $0.01 when the dust settles (Trump makes a deal or court rules favorably in one of the many cases) then the preferred is worth par value. The Senior Preferred is owned by the government along with warrants.\n\n/u/keepwinning [post](http://imgur.com/a/KJfY8) shows he holds many of the preferred securities on $FNMA and $FMCC. The preferred securities offer a *safer* trade, with lots of upside and lots of room to exploit strange pricing differentials. \n\nI [sold out](http://imgur.com/a/25rGC) of the $FNMAS yesterday to move into the $FREJP.  The $FNMAS have a $25 par value while the $FREJP have a $50 par. The $FNMAS were trading at $8.29 while the $FREJP were trading at $11.25. I paid $3 for $25 more in upside. There are other reasons I am choosing to hold $FREJP over other preferred securities but that not relevant to this post.\n\nI may look to consolidate my position further into $[FNMFO](http://www.quantumonline.com/search.cfm?tickersymbol=FNMFO&sopt=symbol). This preferred security has a par value of $100,000, a redemption value of $105,000, and embedded call option for 1060.3329 shares. It trades between $20,000 and $25,000 (19% to 24% of redemption value). Comparing this to $FNMAS or $FREJP and we see that these trade at 33% and 22.3% of par, respectively.\n\nTherefore, the question of to invest or not moves from, \"$FNMA or $FMCC between $4.00 and $6.00?\" to \"Is $FNMA and $FMCC worth at least $0.01? If so, what's the maximum upside across **all available securities**\".\n\nWe can discuss and debate what the best way to trade this is  but there are so many unknowns. What if the warrants are cancelled? Common Stock to $150. What if preferred stock is converted into common stock for a restructuring? Dilution of common but par value of preferred. What if...? What if...?\n\nI have no probabilities to assign to this and that makes me want to move more into $FNMFO since I know the preferreds are \"money good\". I receive all of the benefits of the preferred security, have a redemption value larger than par, a 21.2% dividend yield (should this be restored), and an embedded call option (strike is really between $18 and $23 at this price point) should there be a massive move upwards.\n\nYou need to answer some of these questions for yourself to decide if you want to make the investment. Once you decide to make the leap then there are many ways to trade this event driven investment.\n\nLast point to all the RH users... Was saving $7.95 on a trade worth missing out on a once in a generation trade? Move to a real broker. You will think through your buys and sells and can YOLO like a real WSB subscriber.\n\nHotlinks: \n\n1. [GSELinks.com](http://gselinks.com/)\n2.

There are many people who had their whole retirement fund in F&F pre crash and the government has taken all of it and then some, all under the pretense of we're protecting the people from another crash.
