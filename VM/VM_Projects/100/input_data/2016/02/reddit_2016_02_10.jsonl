They're really just mental shortcuts that are useful when looking at stable businesses, but less useful when looking at businesses that have the potential to grow a lot.\n\nDid you know that when Google first listed in 2004, it was on a PE of 65-70x that year's earnings? The stock is up 14x since then.\n\nOn to Apple, the issue people are grappling with is whether their current profitability is sustainable. They made $18 billion in profits last quarter, which is more than any other company in history ever. The bulk of their profits come from the iPhone, and people worry that it's mature. It's also the type of product you need to convince people to buy upgrades for every few years, which is different than other business models where the recurring income is more predictable.\n\nThis year growth will be minimal because they're cycling the iconic launch of the iPhone 6 which is tough to match. How will the iPhone 7 towards the latter half of this calendar year (next financial year - they're September year end) compare? The iPhone 6 likely had a lot of switchers who wanted a large form factor phone. Perhaps that won't happen again.\n\nThe other market concern is what's happening with replacement cycles. If the differentiation between subsequent iPhone models lessens over time (as has happened with PCs in general), then there's less need to upgrade, and the average upgrade time can extend out. If that happens, revenue can fall since your business model is selling product, in which case maybe you're not on 10x but you're on 11x or 12x... and if revenue and profits are falling, maybe that's not an appropriate P/E.\n\nApple is also so big now that it's very hard for them to launch another product that moves the needle. Apple Watch? Doesn't matter. Apple Pay? Doesn't really matter either.\n\nSo they're the sort of things to consider, and the sort of things Apple bears would be worried about. My personal view is Apple is reasonably cheap here and adequately reflects those risks.\n\nAs for Amazon, their opportunity set is considerably different. Where Apple watchers are considering whether they've peaked, Amazon watchers are considering just how big their opportunity is. \n\nOn the retail side, the typical Amazon bull argument is to forecast increasing sales for 5-6 years and then assume they get back to a normalised margin once they achieve greater scale, in which case future profits can justify what you're paying today (and if they do that, a one year forward P/E isn't all that relevant).\n\nOn the AWS side, we're in a world where many incremental workloads are going to public hyperscale cloud providers where Amazon is king. How big can that get? It has the potential to swallow a significant amount of IT budgets around the world, and it seems to be a business where only 3 companies will be able to do it at real scale.\n\nSo what's that worth... good question, it's hard to tell, but with that framework you can begin to understand why someone would view $224 billion for Amazon (market cap) as cheap while viewing $527 billion for Apple (market cap) as expensive.\n\n", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Because everyone is long.

Around 70-80% of the turnover is generated with the sales of the iPhone.\n\nBuying an Iphone (or an other product of Apple) is not cheap. Apple gains a strong premium on the sale of its products. This results in very high margins (http://financials.morningstar.com/ratios/r.html?t=AAPL&region=usa&culture=en-US). \n\nDespite the positive elements mentioned above, some investors do worry. Some analist say that Apple needs a new blockbuster to boost sales. Yet, this is not expected in the near future. Therefor, it makes sense that analyst expect a flattening of the sales growth.\nIs this a disaster? No! Apple has strong fundamentals. In addition it pays a generous dividend. \nYet, the decrease in growth is worring the markets. Some analyst did overestimate the growth power of Apple. Also, I guess that some people need to cope with the idea that Apple is moving from a strong growth company to a solid mature company.\nIn addition, many short term traders are coming into the stocks who anticipate a further drop.
