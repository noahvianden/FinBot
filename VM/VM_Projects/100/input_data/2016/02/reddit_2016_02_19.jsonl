{"title": "For the noobs: Switch from Robinhood to Ustocktrade", "selftext": "Ustocktrade - An Alternative Trading System\n=\n=\nLink: https://www.ustocktrade.com/\n\n=\n\nDisclaimer (Personal opinion):\n\n=\nOk before you big money stock option elite give me crap for posting something like this, this is NOT for you. Y'all good where you are. But I thought those who have a little fund, less than $5000, college students, folks with new experience, broke people, Robinhood users, Loyal3 retards, may be interested in this?\n\nWhat is Ustocktrade?\n=\n\nIt's some weird alternative trading system (ATS) created by Tony Weeresinghe who has been involved in the development and implementation of stock exchanges around the world. He has provided IT solutions to capital markets in more than 60 sites across 5 continents, including the one used today by the London Stock Exchange Group. London Stock Exchange so you know at least he knows his shit unlike the noobs at Robinhood. How an ATS works is it essentially tries to buy and sell stock not through a broker but directly from institutions. Yes, many of you probably didn't know this but there is a big market where people just exchange stocks directly and avoid the whole broker shit. It matches buyers and sellers directly.\n\nMy experience with it:\n\n=\nIt feels exactly like any other broker except for one thing: An ATS does not have to follow the PDT rules set by the SEC, so your funds settled T-0 as often as you want to. You heard right, you can essentially yolo your whole cash fund in a single stock in the morning, pull out, yolo it somewhere else. As much as you like without being flagged for pattern day trading. So I've been using this for the past month or so and I want to share my pros and cons with those of you who are like me. You were probably on Robinhood and are now considering switching.\n\nPros:\n=\n-$1 commission for T-0 trading\n\n-It fucking shows bid and ask!!! Unlike Robinhood you can now see the price at which buyers are willing to buy and sellers are willing to sell!\n\n-No PDT rule applies\n\n-Banking transfer in and out is free and takes 2 business days\n\n-Supports all stocks traded on NASDAQ and NYSE, now including ETFs, ETNs and stocks under $1\n\n-Has a web platform + iPhone app (Android in private beta right now!)\n\n-No minimum balance\n\n-They approve anyone within 24 hours. I told them I was a student they opened my account within hours.\n\n-Free real time quotes and a little news\n\n-The real time graph shows you were you bought and sold if you did at all. Something even ThinkorSwim only added recently.\n\n-Has a little trade school where you  can basically paper trade.\n\n\nCons:\n=\n-~~NO ETFs, ETNs, OTC stock, or NYSEMARKET stocks are supported right now! So if you play stuff like NUGT, TVIX, UWTI, DWTI, SPY, etc you won't be able to trade it here.~~\n\n-Bad account overview. Unlike Robinhood you won't see a graph of how your gains moved over the day which is straight up dumb. I tried to look everyone but I couldn't find anything so you really just have to remember with how much money you started with.\n\n-Same applies to account statements which are not detailed at all and are posted in pdf the day after.... No way to see P/L in a single place. You will have to do the math yourself. Instead they give you a fucking pie chart like why would I even care.\n\n-NO shorting, no stop limit, only stop loss called \"Get Out\"!\n\n-NO extended hours trading!!\n\n-NO options/futures/forex trading either!!\n\n-~~NO trading of stocks under $1. They will be displayed but you cannot trade them.~~\n\n-No advanced research tools, technical voodoo or any of that fancy stuff. You will have to find that yourself. But it now has provides some news from partners.\n\n-~~Execution is not always shown instantly but it happens at the set price.~~ Execution has improved.\n\n-Maximum buy execution cannot exceed $10,000. But, sell is unlimited. This was designed to keep institutions out. \n\n-It is unclear whether your funds are FDIC insured or SIPC or insured at all. It seems there is no requirement for this on alternative trading systems because they are dark money pools.\n\nNeither Pro or Con\n=\n\n-[Customer service?](https://twitter.com/Ustocktrade) I don't even know they have anything like that. Honestly the only time I have ever called any customer service is to change my commission structure or an accidental short which should be a nonissue here. But you can always ask their Twitter account and they usually reply.\n\n-$1 a month membership fee.\n\nScreenshot:\n=\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/tJo73Wi.png\n\n=\nI expanded one tab on each of the tickers to show you what they look like. You can of course expand all the tabs at once.\n\n=\n**Price chart** shows you the real time, Day, Month or Year chart. \n\n=\n**Strategy** is where you can see all the triggers you want to program, be it alerts or trigger stop loss or trigger order at a certain price. \n\n=\n**Transactions** shows you pending orders as well as executed orders of the day.\n\n=\n**Corporate actions** I have never seen this thing do anything yet. But, my guess is this is where dividend announcements and reverse splits or dilutions show up.\n\n=\n**News Feed** just gives news from StockTwits and TheStreet related to the stock ticker. It's a new platform and I guess they will add more quality news in the future.\n\nConclusion\n=\n\nWho is this great for?\n\nAnyone with a small yolo budget who really wouldn't see a big dent if they split up their funds. You can go $500 into one stock on one day, sell and then do the same thing somewhere else on the same day, multiple times, as long as you have money. If all you do is play stocks and specifically earnings, dividends etc, this is it. If you are the type who feels 100% confident that a stock will blow up tomorrow and you want to roll over your whole fund from one to another, this is the one. Ustocktrade's mission even says that it was designed for young adults who don't have the funds to get access to the way big traders trade.\n\n=\nWho is this not designed for?\n\nElite traders who rely on perfect execution, elite traders who need ETFs, ETNs, options, and forex, elite traders who buy and sell more than $10,000 worth of shares in a single transaction, elite traders who short, my message is: If you are already spoiled and don't mind paying $7-10 commission where you are, this is not worth it. But, if you are a Robinhood trader with a relatively small fund and you have other means to find DD, technicals, etc, this is better.\n\nDo I recommend it? Fuck, I use it. It feels just like any broker. Switched from Robinhood to TDA margin to Robinhood and now Ustocktrade, and have been playing stocks with this ever since. I think the most important thing here is T-0 trading and the presence of bid and ask which already make this 5x better than Robinhood because you are not left in the cold about how big the spread between the two numbers is and you can pull out whenever you feel like it and re-enter at a lower point instead of averaging down like some fool. **I'm here to answer any questions I can answer about my experience**. I will be the Ustocktrade guy of wsb, just pm me or reply here if you want to switch. And no I didn't get paid for this. Could care less. I just think Robinhood users deserve more flexibility.\n\n=\n\n=\n\nLink: http://ustocktrade.com/\n\nFAQ: http://ustocktrade.com/faq\n\nTheir philosophy: https://www.ustocktrade.com/the-cainan-foundation/\n\n\nFAQ:\n\nQ: Since it's an ATS, are the stock prices different than displayed at other brokerages?\n\nA: No, I cross checked with any broker I can find and they display the exact same prices at the exact same time. Bid and Ask. They say they show NBBO and it feels exactly like any other broker.\n\n=\nQ: Any hidden fees? Where's the catch?\n\nA: No catch, the founder is some type of philanthropist who believes that college students could pay for college by stock trading (hey, why not?). The costs are covered by the $1 commission.\n\n=\nQ: Do I have to lie during sign up to be approved like the other brokerages?\n\nA: Nope, like I said they encourage college students to sign up. Jut pick student and don't worry about the other income crap.\n\n=\nQ: What is PDT?\n\nA: PDT or Pattern Day Trader rule is a rule set by the SEC that says any margin account (T-0 settlement) can only do 3 day trade round trips in 5 business days unless the account is more than $25,000. But, this rule only applies to the traditional definition of a brokerage. What this guy did here, because he's smart is design a brokerage that does not fall under the definition so you can yolo the crap out of it without getting in trouble.\n\n=\nQ: How does that affect taxes?\n\nA: Hmm I honestly don't know. I would think no matter how you got the stocks you would still pay capital  gains and be eligible to write off losses.\n\n=\nQ: Should I use a more informative platform and DD along with this?\n\nA: There is no other way to do it. This broker is barebones. You will have to find other ways to analyze the stock. This platform is just for buying, selling and keeping track where it is. Nothing else.\n\n=\nQ: Can I transfer my Robinhood shares to Ustocktrade?\n\nA: That's called ACAT. Ustocktrade offers a free transfer in. However, Robinhood does not support any form of ACAT right now: https://support.robinhood.com/hc/en-us/articles/203583765-Broker-to-Broker-Transfers\n\n=\nQ: Are there other ATS's around or is Ustocktrade the only one?\n\nA: Well, I am only familiar with Ustocktrade as the only one accessible to regular people, but here is a list of all the others, maybe you find something: https://www.sec.gov/foia/ats/atslist0116.pdf\n\n\n**Edit 1:**\n\nUstocktrade now supports ETFs, ETNs and stocks under $1.

Since you can't short you can only play great ERs. Like do the most insane research you have every done for a stock ticker. \n\n1. Fundamentals: How much is the company in debt, what are the companies plans, are all these things already factored in, what do previous quarter results tell you about where the company is going, how is that industry sector doing overall, how much of the product that the company is selling are people using (has it increased or decreased)?\n\n2. Technicals: How did stockholders respond to the last ER. For that I look at Google Finance which shows you an annotated chart for a year or so and you can see how stockholders tend to react. Then I look at where the company was at the same point last year (2015) and the year before (2014) if there is any data. If they are the same or lower, it won't matter how good the ER is, it's still bad news and people will sell.\n\n3. I grab those shares at the most oversold price you can imagine. I am not even going to buy ANYTHING that is already above the 3 month average. The stock price has to be really far below what it is trading on average. You have some opportunities for this a week before the ER AND on the trading day right before ER because that is usually when the stock is the most volatile.\n\n\n=\nHere's an example. \nI have been playing WYNN last week. \n\n1. It's a resort known to be in Las Vegas and Macau. Great financials. From the reviews of consumers I hear a lot of them absolutely love to go there. Apparently it's one of the best hotels in terms of pricing and service. Their revenue has increased according to their SEC filings and forecasts. Debt is more than manageable. Ok, fundamentals are great.\n\n2. The past ERs have caused this thing to rise to extreme heights over a multi day period but never really crossing past $70. Something worth nothing. But, overall institutions and people react positively to good ERs and buy in. Ok, good technicals.\n\n3. The average is around $65-70. But the whole oil crash caused it to drop to the 50s last week. which is way oversold. I knew the average for this was between $65-70 and a good ER would help it bounce back in that region. I also knew there was an ER on Thursday afterhours (or Friday morning? I forgot) so all I had to do is get this thing in the 50s. Lucky for me it was very volatile before ER so I was able to pick it up for $57. Bought $500 worth of it, sat down. Next day the stock was $69, sold. Knowing that it never usually goes past $70 I was happy with $69 but I forgot one thing from my own DD. A good ER usually results in a multi day rally which is exactly what happened. That stock went up to $75. Oh well. Still gains.\n\n=\nPlease! PLEASE consider fundamentals and technicals and always buy oversold because this won't always be the case and a good ER usually will cause the tock to go up and then sharply drop. You don't want to be one of those people who bought it at the highest point the day before because that point already factors in good news. But, what Ustocktrade allowed me to do is to do this on a regular basis with a smaller amount of money. I used to have $4000 on RH just so that I always have $500 on a given day. Now you see from my screenshot I barely have $1000 and that's all I need to play the same game without having to wait for these stupid funds to settle.

That's how ATSes work. They are self-contained and rely entirely on people who decide to use them, meaning you willingly segregate yourself from the entire market that would otherwise provide mass liquidity and volume. There is no way around that fact.\n\n- /u/GoldenChrysus", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "I've lurked for a long time, but felt I needed to respond to this.\n\nHow different is Ustocktrade to other ATS’s and execution venues in the USA\n\nI have been involved in developing Matching system for ECN’s and Exchanges. I now work with a large \n\nexchange venue in US. I have never met the founder but have heard so much of him. My sales executive \n\nalways mentions how difficult it is to win when this guy is involved in the sales. When the London Stock \n\nExchange regain their market share from 40% to 65% we were amazed. When we spoke with a technical \n\nperson of a global Brokerage he mention in a staff meeting the CEO mentioned this is the only guy who \n\nwant to understand his clients. He mentioned when he came to meet with him his introductory question \n\nwas what I can do to help you make money. Which is quite different to other exchange executives come \n\nto meet him. So knowing this about him from the time he launched Ustocktrade got me inquisitive \n\nhere’s what I found\n\nI got one of my friends who is a serious investor to create an account with Ustocktrade.\n\nHe called me the next day and said he I can trade on Ustocktrade, this got me puzzled where other \n\nbrokerage takes 3 days we could trade the next day. I went to his place as I was on vacation we decided \n\nto trade the same symbol with his broker and Ustocktrade, it was BABA, We looked at the market data \n\nof the indicative (as you know this is not the actual price as we exchanges execute in micro seconds) \n\ntrade price, the bid and offer it was almost the same or very close. Scrutinizing the market data the BID \n\nand OFFER quantities displayed was like a large exchange. This got me confused a little bit more how \n\nthey can have people sending orders of that magnitude, when I went into a bit more detail I found out \n\nhe is showing the market data from the exchange venue he is getting.\n\nThat’s the 1st difference, In an Execution venue we displayed only our data, what is called the order \n\nbook which has all the quotes, level 1 is the top of the book, and level II is the whole book. So \n\nUstocktrade is not showing their order book but showing market data from the venue they are getting \n\nthe market data, like any other brokerage not like an execution venue.\n\nThe order got executed immediately and got a better price on Ustocktrade. Wow how did this happen? \n\nSo I called one of my friends in the exchange and asked him to take a look at the report that mentions \n\nwho made the price in the market at that time on BABA (sparing all the Tec details). He said Ustocktrade \n\nthis got my inquisitiveness to another level, I started to dig further then I found out Ustocktrade \n\nmatches on UTP data, that is the best National Bid and Offer of the whole market, all execution venues \n\nVERY CLEVER\n\nThis is the 2nd Difference, Execution venues executive on their order book Ustocktrade executes on the \n\nNBBO. This is the reason they without fear show the NBBO on execution as they are making sure the \n\ninvestor gets the best price in the market. We also saw price improvements.\n\nThis is the 3rd Difference, They match at mid-point of the NBBO. This is done most by Dark Pools e.g.; \n\nUBS where the big banks and Brokers, Hedge funds get price improvement. He is giving the same \n\nfunctionality to retail investors.\n\nThe 4th Difference is the same day settlement, He has used all his experience in clearing and settlement \n\nsystems he build and integrated it to give same day settlement to protect the investor.\n\nTechnical Architecture-vice a beautifully designed system, Kudos to Ustocktrade", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "your formatting made me physically sick", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "you seriously need to fix the formatting. this is the fucking ugly.
