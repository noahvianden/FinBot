{"title": "$TSLA and the problem with all of you", "selftext": "I always see a lot of chatter about Solar City and the Chevy Bolt from you all when discussing TSLA. I'll briefly address why neither matter before telling you why you should dump your life savings into Tesla: SCTY adds little *product* value and nobody cares about the Bolt.\n\nNow, lets jump into it: You jabronis think TSLA is all about the cars or the acquisitions it makes. While they are both contributing factors, Tesla is really a *technology* company, with it's largest asset being *data*. This is how the valuation is derived. The second Tesla begins licensing its tech, TSLA stock will skyrocket. For those who think more long term, Tesla could integrate native advertising within its platform. Being that TSLA is currently sitting at $197ish, there is plenty of room to make huge gains.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n$200+ by end of week (read, Wednesday)\n\n$220+ by end of 2016\n\nQ4 $300+ by end of 2017 lol\n\n**Edit:** First call = true.\n\n**Edit:** Second call = true.\n\n**Edit:** Third call = true.", "id": "584h36", "created_utc": 1476805454.0, "score": 38, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 97, "comments": [{"body": "Partially right.\n\nThe data is an enormous advantage over Google - they have thousands of cars in production just slurping it up.

So they will have the hardware, they'll have the software, and they'll own the automotive space.\n\nI'm not talking like hey they'll be a player, they will be the Apple of the space.\n\nMeanwhile they'll own the battery tech, charging network, and solar network. You know what we call that? That's an energy play boys and girls.\n\nThat's right. Musk is going to be the next Carnegie and Rockafeller. No one cares about your high PE ratio.
