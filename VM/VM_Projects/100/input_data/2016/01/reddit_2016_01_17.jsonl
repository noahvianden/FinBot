{"title": "Hey its World_Chaos and I'm doing an AMA @ 7pm Eastern!", "selftext": "**[The post that made WSB and me go viral... I'm sorry about the plebs.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/419ieg/new_to_rwallstreetbets_here_are_some_resources_to/)**\n\n**How the AMA will work:**\n\nI will start answering questions at 7pm Eastern. I will answer the top 25 questions so go ahead and leave and comment and then upvote the questions that you want answered the most. If I have extra time I will answer more questions but I feel like this method will filter out the \"What are options can you please give me free money\" type of questions. \n\n**About me:**\n\nHey its me World_Chaos. Yes it's true I'm a senior in High school and it all started because money has always been my passion since I was little. It was my passion so much that my father taught me how to swim by throwing coins at the bottom of the pool. He told me that I could keep the coins if I could dive down and get them. This fascination transferred over to middle school when we played stock market games on MarketWatch with friends and in class. From then on I just started to immerse myself into the world and finance and learn as much as I could by; watching shows like Fast Money and Mad Money, listening to podcasts, and constantly staying updated with the news. I trade everyday and when I'm at home I watch the markets on two screens. No, I am not just trading daddy's money I started off buying and selling Ipads by getting a lower price on the [gift card exchange](https://www.reddit.com/r/GCXRep/comments/2za21w/uworld_chaos_2nd_gcx_rep_profile/) for Amazon gift cards then selling the Ipads on Ebay. I took these profits and started trading leveraged ETFs like SPXS, SPXU, UWTI, DWIT on robinhood and then moved over to options on Fidelity. I had amazing success of turning my 3k profit into $15k that eventually my parents and other friends gave me access to their accounts. I've been trading options for a long time and used to post on wallstreetbets but then just kept to myself. Here are some examples of my other posts. [1] (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/38iogh/so_i_sold_the_all_the_puts_for_216k_sorta_weak/), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/389o6s/yolo/), [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/3iavqu/watching_shanghai_slowly_drift_below_3000_as_a/), and [4](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/396gfk/more_yolo_on_spy_correction/).\n\n\n\n**Why do an AMA?**\n\nThe reason why Im doing this AMA is because I've gotten a lot of PMs recently and I've started to get sick of answering the same questions. Some funny examples of the PMs are:\n\n*\"I just got $10k from someone and I want to start trading and shit. Have any advice?\"* \n\n*\"do you think i could make enough pay off my $9,000 car loan?\"*\n\n*\"I'm a junior in college. I need to make at least $1000 quickly, and gambling with options seems like the best option.\"*\n\n*\"Feel free.. to tell me to fuck off - Just curious if you have a game plan or thoughts for next week?\"*\n\n**Whats my play on Tuesday?**\nHonestly no idea it all depends on how the futures look and how these Iran sanctions go through and how Asia looks. So one big mess that I can't tell you till it actually happens. Thats why I'm all sold out and sitting on cash ready. \n\n\n**NOW!!!
