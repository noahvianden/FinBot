Research and development expenses were $5.1 million for the first quarter of 2016, a decline of 45%, compared to the first quarter of 2015, primarily due to the reduction in force and closure of the Paramus, New Jersey facility in 2015 and the transition from development to commercial activities. General and administrative costs were $7.4 million for the first quarter of 2016, a decline of 30%, compared to the first quarter of 2015, mainly due to the reduction in force and closure of the Paramus facility in 2015 in addition to reduced professional fees related to strategic planning activities incurred in 2015 and lower non-cash stock compensation expense. Product manufacturing costs for the first quarter of 2016 were $7.5 million, an increase of 300%, compared to the same quarter of 2015, due to underutilization of the manufacturing facility and loss from foreign currency exchange of $2.4 million related to purchase commitments.\n\nThe Company's portion of the loss sharing under the Sanofi License Agreement was $5.5 million for the first quarter of 2016. The total amount owed to Sanofi is currently $68.8 million, including accrued interest of $2.8 million.\nThe net loss for the first quarter of 2016 was $24.9 million, or $0.06 per share based on 428.9 million weighted average shares outstanding, compared to the net loss of $30.7 million, or $0.08 per share on 398.9 million weighted average shares outstanding in the first quarter of 2015.
