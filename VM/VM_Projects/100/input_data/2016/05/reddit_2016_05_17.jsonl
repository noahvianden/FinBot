Interestingly, I left out Bloomberg research cause they aggregate a bunch of garbage and polish it up and call it \"due diligence\". Bloomberg is company that aggregates real time information and they are good at that, but their research is subpar for my experience. If you really want BB research for a stock let me know otherwise I'm sticking with the investment banks. \n\n\n---\n#RULES\n\n1. **NO fucking Penny stocks**, noone covers this garbage.\n\n2. I will not be posting full research report, only the high level summary found in the beginning. Shit is time consuming to screenshot 20 pages from each place for each name.\n\n3. Sensitive information such as contact for analysts will be blacked out. \n\n4. Don't fucking PM me asking for research. \n\n5. **GET ON THE TRUMP TRAIN OR GET RUN THE FUCK OVER**, don't a be a fucking cuck\n\n6. Top 10 up voted names will get priority, then I will see if I can get to the rest.\n\n7.  ONE NAME PER COMMENT\n\n----\n\nNot everyone covers the name you are looking for, but I'll do my best.
