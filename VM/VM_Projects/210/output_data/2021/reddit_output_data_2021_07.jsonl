{"title": "I built a program that tracks mentions and sentiment of stocks across Reddit and Twitter! This week's most discussed and top growing stocks!", "selftext": "This post is in continuation of a series of posts I made in the previous weeks. The response I received was amazing and a lot of you were asking for continued weekly updates. I have also added the Week-on-Week stock price change due to popular requests. \n\nHappy Independence day to all of you! S&P 500 hit a new high (1.7% WoW increase) following Friday’s strong job report (U.S. economy added 850,000 jobs, the most in 10 months). This marks S&P 500 rise for the 7th straight day, the longest winning streak since last August. Even though the market had a strong rally, almost all the popular stocks took a significant beating in the past week.\n\n**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/3q1rkh0my6971.png?width=1034&format=png&auto=webp&s=0a33ca58866f42a1a9368919fd3e785ce5b96da4)\n\nThis is the first time where all the popular stocks except SPY ended in red the same week. This week's stock returns also illustrate the need for effective diversification of your portfolio!\n\nWISH continues to be the most discussed stock, but its sentiment took a significant beating following the 17% drop in the stock price in the past week (dropped to 4% from 46%). The best performing stock on the list was BlackBerry which almost recovered all its losses following the company’s earnings report. A newcomer to the top 10 list is Virgin Galactic following the announcement that its next spaceflight test will carry founder Sir Richard Branson.\n\n**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/3aliegymy6971.png?width=1221&format=png&auto=webp&s=02872056dc3f6f07f18357a616698dae9429ec56)\n\nAbove is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media.\n\n**Micron Technology($MU):** MU released its [Q3 quarter results](https://investors.micron.com/news-releases/news-release-details/micron-technology-inc-reports-results-third-quarter-fiscal-2021) on June 30th, beating both revenue and EPS estimates. Even though the company had strong quarterly results, the stock tumbled 5% following the earnings due to raising capital expenditure forecast. Investors believe that this is just a minor blip as the company has reported impressive revenue growth of 36% (YoY) and a gross margin of 42% and MU can expect strong demand from the data center, PC and graphics, mobile markets.\n\n**Virgin Galactic($SPCE):** SPCE had a wild week with the stock jumping 23% on Friday after the company announced that its next spaceflight test will carry Richard Branson. The launch is expected to take place on July 11th and marks an attempt to beat Jeff Bezos after he announced that his company (Blue Origin) will have its first passenger spaceflight on July 20th. SPCE stock, in general, had wild swings this year with the stock climbing above $60 in February and then falling as low as $15 in May.\n\n**Vuzix Corp($VUZI):** VUZI is considered to be at the forefront of the wearable smart eyeglasses industry. The company was generating discussions as it gained almost 8% mid-week before dropping down. Investors seem to be extremely bullish on the stock as reflected by its sentiment. The stock has experienced very large swings this year with it starting at $8 in Jan and rallying up to $30 in April before dropping down to its current level of $17. Still, the stock is up 109% YTD.\n\n**Paysafe($PSFE):** Paysafe is a payment platform that enables payment processing, digital wallet, and online cash solutions. The company is trending as it had recently announced its partnership with Microsoft and is now enabling online cash transactions on Microsoft Store. Adding to this, the company also announced an expanded partnership with FOX Bet.\n\n**NIO Inc($NIO):** Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer NIO has now climbed more than 20% in the last month. This strong rally is generating more discussions about the stock. In addition to this, analysts’ recommendation has also become more bullish for the stock with Citigroup‘s Jeff Chung issuing a price target of $72 from the current $50 level. This is predominantly driven by the company’s excellent shipment volume, with NIO confirming they have delivered 8,000+ vehicles in June and 21,896 vehicles for the entire second quarter.\n\n**Honorable Mentions:** ZIM Integrated Shipping($ZIM) got a boost in mentions following [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oakw8w/zim_pirates_of_the_zimmabean_dead_mans_dd/) excellent Due Diligence that was posted on wallstreetbets which showcased the company is a good long-term play. Intellia Therapeutics($NTLA) was also trending following their announcement that they have successfully corrected a hereditary disease ATTR amyloidosis, with a single infusion of CRISPR, a programmable gene-editing tool. The stock jumped 50% on the news but dropped down to a 15% gain over the last week.\n\nThank you for reading and hope you enjoyed this week's analysis! \n\n*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor*", "id": "odjp8j", "created_utc": 1625402538.0, "score": 966, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 201, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|49|**First Seen In WSB**|6 months ago\n**Total Comments**|166|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mtehdq/i_analyzed_all_700_buy_and_sell_recommendations/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oawsxf/i_analyzed_last_15_years_of_news_articles_to_see/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n940ns/i_analyzed_9000_trades_made_by_us_senators_in_the/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o70k70/i_analyzed_the_last_3_decades_of_stock_market/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kl4fhj/one_more_stock_indicator_to_consider_before_your/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/njxv95/a_dd_on_inflation_how_it_affects_stock_prices_and/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mikm42/i_built_a_program_that_tracks_mentions_and/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mnho9j/i_built_a_program_that_tracks_mentions_and/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbtp0q/dont_paper_hand_gme_due_to_boomer_bots_real/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nsvma5/i_analyzed_all_the_controversial_trades_made_by/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n1t0yz/i_analyzed_all_the_motley_fool_premium/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ny6wpp/i_analyzed_3600_ipos_over_the_past_two_decades_to/) \n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Could you do a comment on Clov please?

Methane is a much more potent greenhouse gas than Co2 - it has a stronger effect and dissipates quicker. Over the timescale of 100 years, 1 kg of Methane is equivalent to \\~ 40kg of Co2 and over a smaller timescale of 20-30 years it's much more than that. Cutting methane emissions wherever possible has a massively disproportionate effect on whether or not we will be able to prevent a tipping point / avalanche effect in the next decade(s) or not. The effect is so strong that burning methane gas (which produces Co2) would have a negative carbon footprint (when compared to releasing it into the atmosphere)\n\nMethane emissions from meat production, particularly from ruminant animals such as cows, are extremely high and dwarf any other food production or transport cost by a significant margin (transport emissions for goods are generally not that high, because you can transport so many products at once that the burden on any individual product is very low. Transport emissions are mainly from transporting people).\n\nFor comparison, if you had to drive 100 miles (and back) in your petrol car to buy a kg of any meat replacement instead of a kilosteak, you would have a smaller carbon footprint than when eating the steak.\n\nNow that's the consumer end, let's look at the production: Animals need feeding and they're not sustaining themselves off grass alone. Food production needed for animals is insane. It varies depending on the animal and region, but 20kg of food per kg of meat is on the conservative side of things. This food needs to be grown like most other food, and producing 20kg of food - even if it is low quality animal food - creates significantly more emissions than the production of 1kg of high quality human food.\n\nLand requirements are also massive: Land requirements for both the food production for cattle and the cattle themselves are **the** reason for the destruction of the amazon rainforest, being responsible for some 80-90% of the deforestation. A common myth is that illegal logging is responsible for the rainforest destruction, but they only make up some 2-5% of the actual loss. No, the amazon rainforest is burned down in huge areas to use the extremely fertile soil for animal food or grazing lands (burned rainforest lands are extremely fertile and quickly become grasslands).\n\nLastly, as some other people here mentioned, there is an environmental component as well (water requirements). It's not a factor when the meat is produced in a wealthy nation, but most of it comes from poorer regions, where water is scarce and necessary for the survival of humans - or their farms at the very least. Oftentimes this means buying the only wells in the area and building a fence around them (or exhausting them), so that the people living in the area can no longer sustain themselves and become refugees. But at least the companies do a nice charity dinner for poor children in Africa once in a while, isn't that nice :)\n\n**tl;dr** Ethical points aside, meat (particularly steak) is extremely bad for the climate and worse than pretty much else you can do by several orders of magnitude.

The geofenced lidar approach is not scalable anytime soon. Equipment is to expensive to be a mass market product and it takes way too long to map the whole world. It also means you have to re-map everything once in a while because streets change, there's construction and new streets all the time, meaning your HD maps are outdated and not reliable.Tesla will have a universal solution way before they even mapped a fraction of the roads.\n\n2/ Why would it be safer? Lidar and geofencing are used for localisation, not for car behavior. Localisation is basically solved now with vision only, rendering lidar pretty much obsolete. How save an autonomous car drives is based on the neural net model and behavior solution, not on the sensor suite.\n\nAbout safe car behavior:\n\nDriving a car autonomously is basically impossible to program explicit, there's to many variables in traffic, therefore only an implicit machine learning algorithm will ever serve as solution. Neural net models are trained and improved with massive amounts of data and supercomputers. Tesla has about 100x the amount of (real world) data to the next competitor and one of the most powerful supercomputers in the world.\n\nThis means Tesla can improve their car behavior tremendously faster than anyone else. When they want to train a certain aspect of traffic they can just contact their Tesla fleet on the streets and will have 100s of videos of a situation they need in no time.\n\nI really don't see how anyone would catch up to Tesla. The gap to the next best solution to FSD widens with every month passing, they don't come closer. I also can't imagine some unannouned company having a better solution in a secret lab, again, because of the massive fleet and data Tesla has, used to debug the software and train the model. 1 month of public testing a software is worth more than probably 2 years of closed lab testing. That's why I don't think there is a company which can pull a surprise competitive technology.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Look, I'm a Tesla Bull and investor so I don't need to be schooled on how FSD is a better more universal solution.  That was not my point.  Obviously a universal solution (if it makes it to market in time & is safe) will be far superior and likely more scalable.  But I was trying to get you to think about other complications.... \n\n1/ You say Geofencing / Lidar is less scalable and much more expensive.  Then I guess you'd have everyone believe that Google and all these other corporations are just completely clueless and insane right?  You'd sound like a pretty diluted and brainwashed Tesla Fanatic.  Which I suppose is fine because they do make fantastic cars and technology but no solution is without complications... Not even FSD (as we see that few people using it can drive like a normal human being without being totally on edge about edge cases).  Firstly, Lidar and Geofencing are actually quite scalable (or can be made scalable relatively painlessly).  Waymo or other types of companies are already covering major parts of San Francisco and similar cities.  They basically build a nice large van that carries multiple people extremely safely from point a to point B.  You speak of construction & new streets etc as if these are big monsters... Look, existing navigation systems can already easily find detours so there you go... There's a very inexpensive and easy way to solve any reported or planned construction.  They can simply Detour the damn thing... By no means is an entire remapping (as you suggest) required!  So a bit of an exaggeration on your part to assume that due to \"construction\" or similar developments, that every inch of a city needs to be remapped.  All they do is at the click of a few keystrokes, reprogram their guidance systems to Detour it.  So this renders your argument moot!\nTo say they're not scalable is also a bit exaggerated because if you have a big van or bus like vehicle carrying dozens of people, it's actually far more cost effective and scalable than individual cars, and don't for one minute assume that Tesla is not concerned about some of these realities they're facing.  This may in part also explain why last year (2020)....retail investors and investors in general were far more Gung Ho and diluted about your Universal Solution than they are today (hence the extremely flat and anemic stock price for half this year).   People are not stupid they know what's practical and what's not and many aspects of FSD are yet to be trusted by the larger masses except for the Yuppies who have paid 70k plus dollars to buy their brand new Tesla with a large flashy screen on it to glue their eyes to while the car goes and pulls a deadly surprise move! \n\n2/ You say Lidar and GeoFencing are used for \"localization\" and not car behavior.  This is partly true in that FSD is capable of \"learning\" new situations based on the vast amounts of video footage and subsequent labeling of objects it can do when said data is fed to the neural nets (and as you correctly point out, it's constantly improving).   But localization was never intended to teach car behavior.... In fact in that approach, learning is not a requirement because many of the unknowables of driving are reduced to much simpler calculations.  In fact, Lidar and Geofencing (while not universal nor as visually sophisticated as FSD) are a far simpler means of routing a vehicle extremely safely and predictably through particular streets and areas of a city... And Lidar is able to actually see many objects for blocks around the vehicle (not just what's visible to the camera lense).   So this notion that you seem to be positing so positively... That Lidar and Geofencing cannot be used for driving / transportation is just flat out false... Its already happening and working successfully and extremely safely.  I'd love to hear of one news report about a Geofenced Lidar enabled vehicle killing its occupants or others outside.  I have never seen anything mentioned as such \n\nAt any rate, like I said.... I'm overall a Tesla fan and Bull (and my portfolio is 100% Tsla).  But I'm not so diluted that I will make myself believe there is no other possibility of first mover advantage for consumers using the Lidar approach because if (and this is not likely but there's definitely a chance).... That if the many competing companies using the Geofenced and Lidar approach manage to grab a large enough part of the market before Tesla FSD catches on... \n\nThen what we might see happen is that Tesla owners and Robotaxis will may possibly not have as huge a market share as we are projecting.  Again, I'm talking about major metropolitan cities where a Bus or Van can easily help carry dozens of people every hour, to and from the major points of the city or even from a nearby bus stop to their work and back.  Notice I am intelligent enough to realize that FSD would still be far more scalable and cover more areas... But I am saying that the revenue of so called Robotaxis in major metropolitan centers may not be as great (or a monopoly) like we may be expecting.   And if you're gonna say that 100% of all future mankind transportation will definitely (by necessity be from Tesla Robotaxis)... I'm afraid you're mistaken.

{"title": "TSLA is still Undervalued", "selftext": "Tesla Stock still has huge growth potential.\n\nListen up fellow apes. I will try to make this short and simple.  I believe TSLA is headed towards a $2T Market Cap.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**PE Ratio**\n\nThe PE Ratio measures current share price relative to its per-share earnings. This reflects how much an investor is willing to pay for earnings.\n\nFor a company not rapidly expanding, a normal P/E ratio is around 20:1. The average PE for the S&P is something like 15.\n\nWe have all read about TSLA having an insanely high PE ratio in the past. That was before they started making over $1B per quarter.\n\nNow the PE ratio is lower, but still very high.\n\nTSLA is currently around a PE of 112 for forward earnings. The stock costs \\~$650 per share. And the earnings per share were $1.45 for Q2.\n\nSo 650/ (1.45 x 4 quarters) = A forward PE of about 110.\n\n(I am multiplying by the most recent Q2 and assuming the earnings are the same going forward for the sake of simplicity in this example)\n\nAnother way is to take annual earnings and the total market cap of the company. Their recent earnings were about $1.14B in Q2. So assume $4.56Billion for the next year.\n\n$622B market cap / 4.56B annual earnings = PE ratio of \\~135\n\nThis is with them making around 200,000 vehicles per quarter in Q2 2020. Or an annualized rate of just over 800,00 vehicles per year. Just doing an average of 1.14Billion / 200,000 gives us about $5,000 \"per car\". This ignores the energy sectors and software, solar, etc. Just a point of reference for an average.\n\n**Future**\n\nDoes anyone expect Tesla to be standing still for the next few years?\n\nOf course not.\n\nWith Berlin and Texas coming online, Tesla may reach 900,000 cars this year. In 2022 they will likely be well over 1.5million cars per year.  So let's assume that by 2024 they are making 3 million cars per year.\n\n3,000,000 cars x $5,000 per car = $15Billion per year in earnings.\n\nHow about with $8,000 per car?\n\n=$24Billion\n\n$24Billion x 30 = $720Billion Market Cap\n\nHow about a PE ration of 50. Since this seems like something investors have had no trouble tolerating over the life of TSLA's stock.\n\n$24B x 50 = $1.2T Market Cap.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet's try that again for 2028\n\nAssume 6million cars per year and profits of $12,000 per car as efficiencies ramp up across all sectors.\n\nThis gives an annual earnings of $72B.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n((-Again, this sort of ignores the energy sector, software potential, etc.\n\n\\-Just the $10/month that Tesla charges for premium connectivity will become a high margin revenue generator. Around 2023 or 2024 Tesla will have about 5million cars on the road being charged the monthly cost.\n\n$120/year x 5,000,000 cars = $600,000,000 per year in mostly profit.\n\n\\-The Supercharger costs to other Automakers could also become a huge revenue generator. ))\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**A PE ratio of 30 on $72B is $2.1T**\n\nThis would be a stock price around $2200 per share.\n\nIf Investors are willing to tolerate a higher PE, then the Market Cap could hit 2T much sooner.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Other Notes**\n\nIt is worth considering that if the stock gets into the Low $1,000s, Tesla may split it again. When it was announced last time there was a massive increase in the stock price before the split. It went from the low 1,000s to the mid $2,000s. The Mid $2,000s would be a Market Carp \\~ $2T.\n\nEdit: No matter what you think about 'FSD', it should be easy for everyone to accept that once Tesla gets FSD approved in a single jurisdiction, the stock will also jump through the roof. It doesn't matter if it will be in 2022, 2023, or 20XX, etc. I left that out since it is a whole separate discussion. And is not needed for my math of a $2T market cap.\n\nDon't listen to me. Ignore my assumptions. Invest in Banana futures.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fxvjbopra5e71.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2f7562c3ea2991c9e9c8de406b1d76d40d9780cf", "id": "otwk5v", "created_utc": 1627561887.0, "score": 195, "upvote_ratio": 0.69, "num_comments": 208, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|4|**First Seen In WSB**|5 months ago\n**Total Comments**|54|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|6 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.14477409422397614}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 155, "replies": [{"body": "Petition for Cathie to start an onlyfans:", "score": 71, "replies": [{"body": "All proceeds go to Tesla shares. infinite money glitch.", "score": 32, "replies": [{"body": "I’m getting a raging nostalgia boner reading this DD and comment thread.", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "I was thinking the exact same things. people called them crazy when they said this at 8-900 pre split.

(That number also inlcudes plug-ins and hybrids electrics). While the global EV market has been booming, Tesla has not been able to keep up. Its global market share has dropped from 29% to 11%. This means that not only has tesla not been able to keep up with demand, but that competitors are eating away at its dominance. With companies like Ford and Volkswagon saying they are going hard into the EV market, Tesla has some major headwinds. Your estimate of 3 million cars per year by 2024 assumes several things:\n\n1) TSLA can do it (how many years did it take to get its first factory to 900k again?)\n2) If TSLA goes back to its 29% market share, 3 million cars would assume a total market of above 9 million. That would be a 300% increase in three years, or a 45% annual compound growth in the market (much higher than what we have been seeing).

One-thought bears in this case are missing that the primary fundamental is spending, and while excess spending can be a problem when there's a supply problem, all of these supply issues are short term in nature.\n\nAll of the crashes people cite happened in the midst of spending or confidence retractions, and the market goes green two days after it goes red now because of these fundamentals... fear is overpowered by greed when gain is present.", "score": 27, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "But what you've done is distill lots of complex dynamics into a simple position, that's different... and your TA is based on a pattern/breaker rationale, not a belief. :)", "score": 5, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.05221429839730263}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.014822582714259624}, {"body": "I hate this idea that supply chains can just be fixed.
