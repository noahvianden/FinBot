{"title": "Apple TV Plus and Paramount Plus reportedly discussing cheap bundle plan to take on Netflix", "selftext": "https://www.techradar.com/streaming/apple-tv-plus-and-paramount-plus-reportedly-discussing-cheap-bundle-plan-to-take-on-netflix\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), two of the world's most underrated streamers have held talks about creating a cost-effective bundle to put a stop to Netflix's dominance of the streaming landscape. People familiar with the discussions reportedly told the WSJ that Apple TV Plus and Paramount Plus aren't just looking to end Netflix's reign as the world's best streaming service. Per the US outlet's sources, the duo are also said to want to offer their services as a joint enterprise in a bid to save people money. Indeed, the two companies are believed to have had meaningful dialog about offering said bundle at a cheaper price than subscribing to both streamers separately – a deal that would surely pique the interest of customers operating on a budget.\n\nIf the WSJ's report is correct – the outlet is keen to stress talks are still in the early stages – the potential bundling of Paramount Plus and Apple TV Plus into a single package could have a big impact on the wider streaming industry. For one, the world's eight biggest streamers have all raised their prices over the past 12 months – some, such as Disney Plus and Max, have done so twice in less than a year in the US. That's placed undue pressure on people who are subscribed to multiple services, with many forced to choose which one (or, at a push two) to stay with as the cost of living continues to bite.\n\nThe bundling of Paramount and Apple's platforms, then, would be seen as a significant move. Like their rivals, the pair have increased their subscription fees in 2023 – Apple TV Plus' major price hike was particularly irksome to me – and, while each one has some great content to offer customers, their back catalogs aren't on a par with Netflix, Prime Video, or even Hulu. Apple TV Plus' library only consists of first-party (albeit mostly terrific) offerings, while Paramount Plus doesn't have the strength in depth from first and third-party perspectives to compete with the world's most popular services.", "id": "188i79a", "created_utc": 1701453708.0, "score": 421, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 120, "comments": [{"body": "The slow march of streaming becoming cable continues…", "score": 134, "replies": [{"body": "Confused as to how 2 streaming services discussing a cheaper combined plan = cable?", "score": 15, "replies": [{"body": "The people who say things like this fear eventually you'll have to buy bundles because the services won't be offered individually anymore (and therefore you'll have to pay for all the services to get the one you want, like with cable)\n\nNo streaming service has actually done this supposed step two though", "score": 41, "replies": [{"body": "That's not the real thing to fear IMO, it's streaming companies pricing themselves in such a way that just buying one of them makes little financial sense.\n\nFor years people wanted a la carte for cable packages to only pay for the cable channels you wanted.

{"title": "US Retail Group retracts claim that half of inventory loss was due to theft", "selftext": "[Per this article.](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/dec/07/retail-theft-losses-inventory-nrf)\n\nI've tried reporting on this fact here many times.  Deceptive companies and entities with agendas have been wildly embellishing claims of crime as the reason for their performance problems.  \n\nTarget (TGT) is a prime example.  In PR and commentary, they kept falsely implying theft as the cause of shoddy results.  But their dry and raw financial results showed theft was minuscule and that the real causes could be linked to executive ineptitude and poor decision making.\n\nTarget was not alone in this, as others used this false smokescreen.  And it was broadly picked up on by naive and complicit media and civilians.  Those who pushed this false narrative knew (correctly) that the more simplistic and salacious fables about caravans of thieves running through lawless cities would get traction, and that only a few of us would actually read the data and recognize when a big lie was being spread.\n\nFor those interested, shrink is not theft.  Shoplifting is actually only one small part of it.  Shrink encompasses many things, most of them fully under the operational control of the executive management team.  When management makes the choice to cut jobs and mishandle returns, the corresponding cost is higher shrink.  When management decides to use crappy packaging or the lowest bid shipper, that drives up shrink.  Buying shoddier perishables that have to be discarded... more shrink.  The examples go on and on.\n\nSo when their shrink balloons, it's easy for them to exploit false social narratives and pretend their poor decisions and poor results weren't management's fault... it must be because of \"rampant\" theft, because they and most people think the big shrink number means theft.\n\nOne exception has been the plain speaking head of Costco (COST) who has mocked industry peers for using this trick.  He outlines that theft is only up an insignificant amount, and that any retailer who actually *did* have a theft problem could easily have mitigated it in a variety of inexpensive ways.  Of course since the theft excuse wasn't authentic, that's why they didn't do the mitigation measures, belieing that they knew their PR excuses were deceptive.\n\n$COST CEO's most recent commentary is that their own most commonly stolen items are paper towels, toilet rolls, bottled water and watermelons.  And that they took measures to reduce that by having a segmented \"under the basket\" focus at checkout.\n\nThe same Costco CEO has debunked other myths around inflation, labor and cost pressures.

If you're the VP operations getting paid $2.5 million plus stock options, isn't it kind of your job to (a) deduce that and (b) solve it?  After accepting your cause determination, then I, as VP Operations start rolling in a new restricted exit layout with every location we refresh.  Have a turnstile or a corner.  Have a receipt checker or security staff.  These are the fixes executives are supposed to come up to justify their fat compensation.  Of course that all assumes theft is actually as big an issue as they say...\n\n> But I agree that stores should not use this as an excuse because the amount actually lost is a small fraction of their business.\n\nAgree.  They allow the exaggerated impressions to persist to disguise other problems.  \n\nDuring a 1.5 year period, WMT nearly doubled while TGT crashed.

At least the majority of that percentage, anyway.\n\nSo... it was transitory... just... macroeconomically (meaning over years) transitory, not \"clickbait news cycle\" transitory.\n\nI still don't trust them entirely, but at the same time if anyone was looking at the data and the capital in the system and the overall dynamics, it was possible to see this outcome and pattern... we just had to ignore fear-oriented biases and think about the patterns, and the bear fearporn was very tempting if you didn't constantly reassess with that data. And people were very happy to attack people who didn't sell those bear theses.\n\nNow we have the next 6 months to get through, which I think may be one of the more dangerous periods because this is when people are looking for something to break... but at the same time we have to remain optimistic because the Fed Put is back, and the market will react to that until we can see it doing otherwise.

If their intent is self-serving, why would they change the data to make it look like their actions had LESS effect.\n\nThis is the opposite of what happens when corrupt oligarchs manipulate data in regimes and situations where that kind of thing happens in a non-transparent way. They typically change data to make themselves look better, not less effective.\n\nBut we don't need to rely on basic logic for this assessment, because the idea that tightening cycles take up to 18 months to show demand destruction isn't a new concept, it's baked into the dynamics and always has been and shows up in every tightening cycle that exists in the past for a very simple reason: Consumers and businesses don't change their behavior until you reach a restrictive stance AND they start to feel that restriction, which means you need several months of increased debt spending before it slows anything.\n\nWe're not just savages clawing around in the muck (well, most of us, anyway) where nobody understands anything.

The math most of them were using would have failed a 3rd grade math quiz. Almost none of them knew how to do a google search.\n\nAnd in the end, it didn't have a huge impact. The change you're referring to was just bringing the data from 2 years to 1 year of a bucket and bringing it a little closer to now, which is more valid.\n\nAnd that was public information... for months... and all you needed to find it was a simple google search. And the implications, while not entirely possible to predict with precision, could easily have been predicted within a range, and it was a far tighter range than people were assuming, which was proven true when all of the conspiracy theorists were wildly wrong about the outcome and the people who did research were correct.\n\nPeople on this sub, when something happens that doesn't conform to their assumptions and wants, assume that if THEY don't understand something, then NOBODY can and it must be a conspiracy.

One of the main problems we have is:\n\na) there is as much people working without legal contracts (so no taxes being payed upon their income) as people that do have legal contracts. This makes for a society where only half of the working class has to pay for every penny the government spends in all of the things I listed above via taxes. As governments realize they are not getting as much money they need to pay for all this variables, they up the taxes, which results in even more people going into the non legal contract sector (their employer and them won't pay any taxes, which results in the pay being a little bit more than if it was all legal).\n\nb) governments spend more than they have and incur in printing or borrowing money from global emergency funds, which lowers the value of our currency, producing inflation and making everyone poorer month by month.

{"title": "$Wix is gonna be a monster pick in 2024, and I am going to continue going all in", "selftext": "In this post, I am going to use some actual logic and reasoning, some anecdotal evidence, and some degenerate logic to appeal to everyone as to why this is gonna be my #1 pick for 2024.\n\nLet's start with some degenerate logic for you guys: Wix is based in Israel. They've been getting attacked for 100 years and still managed to become a tech powerhouse. Intel just announced a multi-billion dollar investment there, and they're gonna win this War on their terms no matter what some mamby pambys crying on social media do.  When they win: Bam. Rally. So buy in for the \"Israel won the the war\" rally, coming soon.\n\nActual Logic and Reasoning: Wix is a leader in a growing and important space. There's some easy transitions into some big markets, and the area of 'no code' websites and tools are becoming a growing part of basic e-commerce sites and most low hanging fruit. Sure, there will always be complex tools needed custom built from professionals, but most restaurants, e-commerce stores, personal brands, news outlets, media brands, and anything of the sorts is where Wix shines.\n\nI am a writer, have a few of my own companies, SEO professional, news, data & analytics, ran some stores, etc. I've used and built with WordPress, Wix, and custom stacks (react), and have used Shopify, Squarespace, and GoDaddy. Basically, I've used all the options in some capacity. Wix currently has a 43% global website builder market share AND GROWING.\n\nRight now, I think Wix is quickly becoming the #1 overall option. As far as investing goes:\n\nShopify is at a forward P/E of 73, and Squarespace is at 31. Wix has a P/E of 23 and still largely depressed stock price after their fall from grace duringthe 2022 crash. (like Zoom and other stay-at-home stocks.)\n\nAs far as the competitors, I've used them all and the advantages between them are quickly fading. Wordpress used to be the 'default CMS' and #1 option for SEO. Now, in my experience, Wix is better for SEO. Let's break it down:- Shopify:  Tends to be the go-to for the e-commerce side of the house. It has a few advantages, like built-in warehousing and some other key features. But largely falls flat on many things outside of this. Wix is making some quick headway here and has apps, services, and other options here for users to build out.\n\n\\- Wordpress: Wordpress used to be the go-to CMS for anyone looking to write blog posts or news. It still is in many ways because its an 'open-source' solution. You can develop on the WordPress program to let users publish on, for example, a custom-built website that's not WordPress. But for anyone with a casual blog, or even a semi-professional basic news site, Wix is more than enough. Wix has an open source program called Velo now to compete with this anyway that I know a lot of people use. I have top-ranked stories published through Wix, and my Wix site has done better SEO-wise than many WordPress sites I've used (I know, for example, backlinks play a huge role in this, but it's just something I've discovered.)  I don't know anyone that uses Wordpress for e-commerce.\n\n\\- Squarespace: It used to be top of the line, then they just gave up.  It's like the budget option that everyone starts out with then abandons because it's terrible at everything.\n\nHere's some key points of growth for Wix:\n\n\\- Payment Processing: You can now use Wix as a payment processor. They take 2.5% and that can QUICKLY add up when you've got millions of websites around the globe. As they keep taking market share, and become a more legitimate option for medium-to-large companies, that could add up quick. It's cheaper than competitors by like .3%, so makes it easier to switch. They're already getting involved in integrating POS devices so people can use Wix to process payments in physical stores as well. So now, they can get in physical retail stores of all the companies on their list.\n\n\\- Newsletters: Everyone has a newsletter now. It's exhausting. I have like three. Wix gives you all the features everyone else has and more because you can integrate it all in one. Lots of people would, for example, use Mailchimp, Beehiiv, or Hubspot for their newsletters AND THEN have several other services for hosting their website, accounts, etc. Wix has a paid newsletter service now, which means people will now launch a website + a newsletter on their site all in one. It maxes out at about $60/month for unlimited email sends. Convert a few hundred thousands users there and you're looking at some solid rev growth of pure profit.\n\n\\- Velo: For people that want that all-in-one solution that Wix offers but using a more open-source and custom solution, Wix launched Velo. Wordpress isn't the only opensource CMS option now, and you can build out some impressive options with the site.\n\nPosition: 500 shares (on margin, for the degeneracy.) I'd buy calls.... but there's not enough volume which sketches me out there a tad.\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "18rzsdx", "created_utc": 1703680714.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.41, "num_comments": 115, "comments": [{"body": "This is the most idiotic DD I've ever read.
