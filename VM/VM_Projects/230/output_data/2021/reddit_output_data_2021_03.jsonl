As an open community, WSB happily welcomes as many new people as we can get but I’m concerned about how that’s changed the dynamic of the subreddit. Before the rise of GME, WSB was a space where everyone was free to discuss various ideas, share DD and gains/loss porn, and post memes about ANY STOCK they liked or were interested in. Even when popular stocks like Tesla and Palantir came about, they never 100% CONSUMED the discussion diversity of the sub.\n\nNowadays, you come on the sub and literally ALL you see is content related to GME. I personally don’t mind all the GME banter, however, what I do mind is the fact that are tens of thousands of other stocks and opportunities yet many people on the sub act like GameStop is the only company that exists. Too many times have I seen a user on the sub post about some investment idea and get immediately shot down and called out for allegedly being a hedgie or shill trying to lift the focus off GME. \n\nAT THE END OF THE DAY THE GOAL OF INVESTING IS TO MAKE MONEY. WHILE GAMESTOP💎🙌🏿 IS A GREAT VEHICLE TO DO THAT, IT IS NOT THE ONLY MEANS OF MAKING MONEY IN THE STOCK MARKET.\n\nWhile I am saying all this, there really isn’t any real way (that I can think of at least) to remedy this issue and this post probably won’t get the publicity and visibility that it needs to make a change. However, I want to make sure my thoughts on the matter are at least out there. Long live diamond hands and power to the player but please remain OPEN MINDED.

Something you have to be aware of if you do that is the downside of your shares might be more than the downside of the S&P 500. You'll have to buy higher leveraged puts, or just more puts to offset your losses, depending on how hard your bullish stocks will be hit during a correction. Growth stocks for example get hit much harder than bluechips.\n\nExample: If your holding shares of a bunch of small growth stocks and a market corrections occurs, S&P500 may pull back 20% and your growth stocks may pull back 70% in that same time frame. You'll have to manage your leverage and risk accordingly. You'll need to get more out of your S&P500 puts to offset your growth stock losses. This all depends on what you have in your portfolio.\n\nSomething else to think about is how to minimize your loss on your insurance puts. The plan is to have those puts incase of a market crash, and most of the time they'll expire worthless. By buying specific puts, instead of letting them expire worthless, you can sell them before expiration and re-coup some of the value, to buy another round of puts with. Of course the intention is to lose money on these puts, and just have them there incase of bad times, but you also want to lose the least amount of money on them, and still have them be able to serve the purpose they are there for, if needed.

But the issue is when the stock goes down that you are invested in because it won’t affect the Margin money, only your money. So here is an example of how it can fk you really bad. You take your $2k, and your margin $2k and buy Tesla with it. So you have $4k in Tesla. Half the money is yours, half is margin, and all the gains belong to you. When Tesla goes down, your margin always stays at $2k, so if it goes down 25%, your $2k takes the full 25% of $4k hit. So 25% of $4k is $1000, your $2k loses $1000, and margin does not lose anything.

I don’t mean to preach, but thought maybe my own bad choices and struggles might help you feel better about yours. \n\nI gotta say, not two years ago I was homeless, living out of a car I still had payments on in order to not get it repossessed and avoid the repercussions to my credit score and my finances in general if I were to miss a payment, etc. that would leave me in an even deeper hole. \n\nI had just left an upper management position with a company because of conflicts with business ethics that I didn’t see as just. Packed up all my things, quit my job, and left the state. Even then, I was sleeping out of my office because my former alcoholic roommate tried to slit my throat while I was asleep in a drunken rage. I worked 90 hours a week, got addicted to prescription amphetamines, had no life but work. \n\nI had a decent salary for the first time in my life, after starting literally from a janitor, working my way to director of operations in the span of 4 months. I was dedicated, hard working, and to be honest, I had only taken the job in the first place to avoid starving on the street.\n\nI was never given much of an opportunity in society’s workplace, because in all honesty I am a convicted felon for distribution of cocaine in my younger years, which was what I felt I had to do at the time to get out of the poverty I was born into, my goal was to be a successful investor in stocks and real estate, and attempt to live a cleaner life that I could accept and not be deeply depressed about.\n\nI started investing, chunks at a time, and made a lot of little mistakes, or had just a bit of unlucky timing that I really couldn’t avoid, and sometimes because I didn’t have the knowledge I wish I had at the time when I made many.... many life choices that have left me with nothing, over and over again. But I am still investing, and I didn’t give up, I hit my face off the pavement so many times, but kept faith in myself and my goals in life.\n\nYou learn, with trial and error and with practice. You will always make mistakes, but without them you can’t gain knowledge that you need to improve.\n\nI got in right before a big market adjustment, saw my entire life’s savings drop 80%. I bought those “dips,” thinking I could at least average down, but then it dips and dips and dips again, and you are stuck thinking about how you wish you would have waited til that next dip, or the next one... damn. How crazy that one day, or in some cases waiting an hour or missing an opportunity because this time you decide to wait, and it was the wrong move... fuck!!! Fuck!!!!\n\nHere is the thing though. Every great investor has had to survive a crash, several actually. Every great investor has failed, has had regrets, and has analyzed every decision they did make as well as all of the scenarios they could have chosen. \n\nYou can dwell on that shit, or roll with it. And with this game, there is no time to dwell. Sometimes you just have to suck it up and hold til it comes around.. and sometimes that takes longer than we would like, probably most of the time. But if you look at the market, and you zoom out on the chart a bit, you’ll see that stock has went up and down before, and unless you picked a dead beat company on a whim with no DD and research, you should be hopeful that it will come back around. It always has. Look at powerhouse companies like Apple, or Tesla right now as it has sank tremendously from the all time highs of not so long ago. But, Apple, Tesla, hell even GameStop came back around from next to nothing. You will come back from it too. If you are out of funds, set some limits that you would be happily to sell at and go figure out other things in life that bring you happiness.\n\nThe days are long if you watch the ticker every second, and it’s hard not to when you are down big, believe me. But have faith in your choices if you made them with confidence originally. ARKK getting hit heavy right now from the tech sell off... and because it is based on innovation and the success of new technologies and ideas, there will be some volatility... but don’t hate yourself because you got in at a bad time. 6 months earlier, you’d be fat and happy on a pile of tendies from ARKK, and this conversation with yourself probably wouldn’t have happened. But what’s to say if you had done that, you wouldn’t have gotten over confident, and pissed it away on something else? Things happen, for reasons, or maybe just because, but when they happen you better be willing to learn, and accept it for what it is, because it ain’t gonna change after it’s done. \n\nThis is a test of your resolve, and I feel that if you have enough awareness to understand what you could have done better, and what you have done wrong... and wanting to improve, well, that is a fantastic start. \n\nIt’s hard to hold and forget, impossible to me. Because I am thinking about how I can improve for the next time I get an opportunity, and in my life, opportunities are rare and when you fuck one up it is the worst. So I’m not saying forget it, I’m saying, understand that all you may be able to do right now is wait it out, but that provides you an opportunity to evaluate what you want to do next, in the market and in life, and i am feeling bullish that you will be able to overcome this, probably multiple times, and likely will have some great advise to give the next generation of investors. That is gain. That is gain in life, which is far more valuable than any stock. So stay strong my friend. Get excited about your next attempt while you wait, and try to spend a little more time working on other parts of yourself that you have the time for while you are waiting to get your money right again. Don’t give up. Don’t forget, but grow. You can always gain every day, regardless if your stocks mirror that. That is your choice, and I repeat, I am bullish for your future.\n\nBe proud of yourself for the attempt. Taking some losses on an ETF is a lot better investment than YOLOing on drugs and going to prison. You are smarter than you probably think, and to reach out shows wisdom, not weakness. Be proud of that, and keep your chin up. Things can literally always be worse, and in a year or two, you’ll be saying yeah, I made a bad call back in early 21, but i turned it into a lesson and from that, became a better investor, who gets better and better at realizing what, when, where, and why to make certain moves. \n\n\nI’d imagine you’ll be comforting some kid who just lost on a reasonable ETF from unfortunate timing, telling him or her the story about how you went from panicked, depressed, and uncertain to become a much better investor, and you’ll have the gains to prove it. \n\nJust hold and forget it you’ll be saying, with a chuckle, remembering back to how those words were so hard to hear at the time.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you.

They convert motorized vehicles into one of two configurations: \n\n\\- XL Hybrid -  25% MPG improvement, 20% CO2 reduction \n\n\\- XL Plug In - up to 50% MPG improvement, 33% CO2 reduction\n\nImportant to note: **they currently are developing full-electric conversions of fleets**, which will improve their revenues greatly once completely developed. \n\nThey also develop and implement EV charging stations. XL currently has the largest charging station deal in U.S. history - they are implementing 1,000 EV charging stations in New York City at UBS Arena (NYI rink). The CEO also stated they have a number of other deals like this in the works just a week ago. \n\nThey have a blue-chip consumer base, including **Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Canada Post, Verizon, FedEx**, and much more!\n\nSome significant shareholders include Blackrock, JP Morgan, and Hudson Bay Capital. \n\nThe current price-targets range from 30-58, that implies a 2.5-5x return from its current levels ($11.90). \n\nThere revenues are expected to grow over 100% every year to 2024. Particularly, there **2024E revenue is $1.4B**. The company currently has $**400M in cash on-hand**, which gives them lots of cash to help in there endeavour to grow significantly. \n\nIMO: **a short-squeeze is imminent**, and we are gonna make those losers over at Muddy Waters cover their short position before the weeks out. \n\nGLTA!", "id": "m20zhf", "created_utc": 1615392589.0, "score": 586, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 224, "comments": [{"body": "👍 \nI bought in for the ride to a new all time high!\nWe can do this! 🌎🚀", "score": 62, "replies": [{"body": "To the fucking moon🚀🚀🚀 my fello tard lol", "score": 48, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.09247413277626038}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.21426253020763397}, {"body": "Been buying for weeks and averaging down.

This is not some vague Chinese company but an American one, meaning their directors would risk real prison time for something like that.

{"title": "Why I think $GME is still bullish and going to moon", "selftext": "Fellow apes, I know many of you, me included, have been through some tough days and hours. Many of you might even have stopped eating crayons or worse: sold your $GME stocks with huge losses. \n\nI want to use this chance to tell you that not all is lost. Nothing is lost (until you sell in fact!). Of course I have no idea what I'm talking about - I'm really no one to trust in financial advice, so be aware. \n\nBut still I am using all these fancy indicators and am wondering why everyone is complaining. Trends in stocks need corrections, that's basic DOW-theory. And how much do they correct in general? A 0.5 Fib-retracement correction is very usual in almost all trends. They even sometimes correct a fib-retracement below. \n\nSo when you're looking at my chart now (very fancy, colors!, buy!) you will see that we're pretty exact around that retracement now. Furthermore price tried to go under EMA50 but directly went up again to the exact position of EMA50. Where are we now?  Correct, almost at EMA50 but NOT below. This is a hell of a support and we're not letting it fall below my fellow apes!\n\nFurthermore EMA100 and EMA200 are still showing upward movement, which is also good. \n\nLast but not least MACD aims for its zero-line and might turn positive. You ask when? Hm, if you look at the MACD trend it might be soon! \n\nAs you can see, from my perspective everything is still fine. For disclosure, I'm stuck in the upper 300s in GME, and I won't sell before we reach at least four digits! \n\nTL:DR: Trend is still fine, EMA50 is holding like a son of a bitch and we should see some upward movement soon. I like the stock and you should like it too. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[My technical analysis on $GME](https://preview.redd.it/rwn267m02un61.png?width=2091&format=png&auto=webp&s=09182b5399332de89d5a0db97254e1762fad8278)\n\nEdit: Some of you have pointed out we shouldn't put dates on our analysis and I must say I agree. Although I see a very good chance of upward movement soon, we shouldn't link this to today or Monday.

GME went from being the most mentioned by like more than 3x to less mentioned than RKT and a few others while it was steadily trading low so I’m pretty confident it will do the same and even less as things settle down. \n\nAll that aside, it’s also not ridiculous to believe that this could become recurring behavior for GME over the next few months.

Think about customer service. Think about who the customer is.\n\nWalk into gamestop. Walk into Pet Smart. Walk into Best Buy. Walk into Target. Ask yourself what could be better and why things are the way they are. Could we do better?\n\nWhen you’ve mastered customer service, willingness to pay increases.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9muytpqzpoo61.png?width=1401&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef5ee3353d240709a49a6a3faafeb7986a5ac1b8\n\n# Purpose\n\nDisclaimer: Don’t use this DD to confirm your bias as a means to make silly choices. Use it as an opportunity to learn you dingus!\n\nSome of you folk may remember the DD I wrote about Cloudflare and serverless computing back in May 2020, but most of those posts were written far less seriously and lacked professionalism. To be frank, I was surprised by the hunger for knowledge and I really enjoyed debating some of the rather brazen people here.\n\nWSB has grown and in my view, our committed analysts tend to BTFO Wall Street analysts. We have on-the-ground experience as laborers, customers, and digital-natives that they often filter out of a privileged ignorance.\n\nPart of this is also due to the fact that I believe that investing in securities will become increasingly complex yet accessible for a typical retail investor which will either result in isolation OR incentivize cooperation.\n\n* Does the average retail investor really understand the core regulatory influences in investments like Square, PayPal, or even rob-the-hood? **(Square DD Complete)**\n* How do we compare social media? **(Pinterest DD Complete)**\n* What really is customer service? **(You are here)**\n* Are we familiar with new international trades that increase Mexican-Texan manufacturing? **(Kansas City Southern DD in Revision Mode)**\n* Is the average retail investor familiar with the network models that govern software like Fastly and Twilio? (**Google DD in Progress)**\n* Do we understand incentives vs. bias? **(Roblox DD in Progress)**\n* How knowledgable are we of fashion trends that make Nike and Foot Locker valuable? **(You are here)**\n* Is an average retail investor familiar with competitive types of manufacturing processes when they invest in technologies like AMD or GE?\n\nAt the end of the day, I am an educator and I believe that the goal of education is to engage a reader into a deeper curiosity or discussion, so that’s why I’m sharing my writing. I’m not here to convince you that this stock is even a good choice - but to explore the economics behind it.\n\n# First Phase: Real Estate\n\nWalk into Best Buy. They do some things right, and they do some things wrong. Want into the gaming section of Target. Notice the activity levels in the region, but think critically of the real-estate afforded to it. How does it affect your experience?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hsbr69iatoo61.jpg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=da613414e26bae76282c1cde1b93bd6c4a4c27f8\n\nUltimately, a floor design is a subset of customer service and sale intentions. A location that sells furniture and diet pills may not service customers the same way a place that sells gaming culture (stream, cosplay) and gaming devices products. GameStop will predictably close down smaller shops, while expanding the size of others to produce an alternative service. Gamestop will no longer be a convenience store aisle, but rather an area for culture.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8wzo5ehztoo61.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e321d639c41825f50b999e3fe8c9f68e55222caf\n\nThe reason for this is clear. Gaming is **BIG** where many players will win. Gaming expands multiple culture vectors. Movies, cosplay events, entertainment parks, meta-verses, sold out arenas, cafes, midnight releases and home development. If you have an industry where people WILL wait in line, you have a goldmine of an industry.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rfg1hnt9voo61.jpg?width=573&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dc610af0af2faa9d17217a1836ac0ffd2991f271\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wl15qmicvoo61.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=57fb1c160657525a45861611f5a8b335aa6544a0\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Second Phase: Customer Service\n\nYou as a dear millennial, or parent of a millennial, understand that gaming is larger than life, and that experience will never fundamentally change. Ryan Cohen understands this. It is the core of an American market, much like Chewey’s targeting of pets. What Ryan cohen seeks is to breech the American household rather than to compete with the likes of Amazon or Target. Ultimately, Cohen is a proud student of Jeff Bezos. This is a stated fact by himself.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mkbo52yswoo61.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fd04ea2474c5e72666b9ca5f01cd2d96d590bbc6\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5a1qcru48po61.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a8fec7d952782ffd663b399dd72361576d86fb9b\n\nAsk yourself:\n\n\\- What if a parent wants to buy a high-grade computer setup for their child? Is it reasonable to assume that a 54-year old mother will understand the differences between AMD and NVIDIA graphics cards?\n\n\\- What services can Gamestop capture to produce economic value for streamers, cosplay, and e-sports consumers?\n\n\\- What products exist beyond Corsair, Logitech, and other big-name products? Do small manufacturers produce good value products that customers may love?\n\n– Can things like Legos, Roblox, Minecraft, and Nintendo find themselves in the same space?\n\n\\- Is it possible to have GameStop create integrations with services like Unity, Steam, Roblox, and other digital services? How rapidly could GameStop capitalize on successes like Among Us or other sectors like child-gaming?\n\n\\- Can GameStop capture bigger sports and sports-betting markets?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/33q7ksn7voo61.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d4042e97ce8df20e5be17824c532d1e3dfb2eace\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Summary\n\nDespite GameStop being in a meme state, it was quite obvious that the organization was undervalued relative to the larger American or global gaming market. The company stagnated and had a weak formula for success in a rapidly evolving retail sector. I personally believe that Gamestop has the potential to sustain beyond 20-30B market cap if it operates and succeeds strategically. The first step was to have leadership that understands the larger-than-life nature of technology and culture, which it has achieved. The next step is transforming the companies space to properly service its customers and products. The final step is to overhaul the customer service to increase engagement, satisfaction, and to put the “custom” in customer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zhm3ea7h2po61.jpg?width=850&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9ccf471f1e8269b636349fce6ac57bd81ee77872\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Naruto: Believe It!](https://preview.redd.it/0himvwbl8po61.jpg?width=760&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7b8b60a889c0debf8c37c69b5cddc1517c0c53df)\n\n[https://media.nichegamer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/09182715/Reggie-GameStop-03-09-2020.jpg](https://media.nichegamer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/09182715/Reggie-GameStop-03-09-2020.jpg)", "id": "mb585a", "created_utc": 1616469163.0, "score": 2068, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 225, "comments": [{"body": "I recently shopped at gamestop, went in there with a blank slate and I am not much of a gamer. \n\nWhat I love:\n\n.

Instead of being these small game shops you see every few miles or so, they're huge community centers where you go to hang out, socialize with others, and completely immerse yourself in the *shared experience* of gaming culture. Would arcades lend to that experience? Sure! It's definitely something they should consider, as I said, but I think they need to get incredibly ambitious here and go for broke. Turn those small mall shops into the huge multi-level storefronts you have to pass through to get to the rest of the mall.

{"title": "You're making a mistake if you sell your Tesla shares today.", "selftext": "I'm posting this because Tesla is down today and I know a lot of you probably sold. I'm here to help guide you back to the light and hopefully get you to buy back your shares before we close today.\n\nI want to start off by saying a lot of people have been freaking out over the past few weeks because Tesla's market cap is higher than other car manufacturers COMBINED. A lot of people think Tesla is overvalued, but I want to dispel this anti-Tesla heresy by making an analogy:\n\n**Tesla is making the iPod and other manufacturers are still making the SONY Walkman.** \n\nIt is true that as far as a \"cars made\" Tesla has produced fewer \"cars,\" but the product Tesla is making is superior. These types of arguments are illusory because they don't compare apples to apples - they're just trying to put an idea in your head.\n\nInstead of selling your shares - you should be buying more right now. I am not a Tesla cultist in anyway. I'm just point out that the people who are taking a dump on Tesla are intentionally misrepresenting arguments in order to persuade you into agreeing with them. A lot of big money sold Tesla before this move down and I guarantee you they're short the company. They want you to sell and then cover only to buy when it dips into the 500s again.\n\n**How to exit a stock without letting your emotions guide you:**\n\nIn all honesty the best piece of advice I can give is to have a check list when you sell any stock. I know a lot of you are like, WhAt'S aN ExiT StrAtEGy? I know a lot of you hate charts so I won't even try to talk about a moving average. But what I will say is this:\n\n1. Ask yourself if you still like the stock.  If it's yes then go to 2. if no, then sell. I don't care why you like a stock, just have an honest conversation with yourself.\n2. Ask yourself: Do I need to liquidate these shares because of an emergency? If yes, then liquidate. If no, then hold. \n3. Has GME gone under $100? If yes, then sell all TSLA shares and buy GME.

VW has been involved in electric vehicle research and small scale manufacture since the 1970s, they never did was Tesla did for lack of money or will. What they were counting on was second mover advantage, a historically successful strategy if you look at how Japan took on global manufacturing. Tesla has created the market that VW is waiting for, and now VW is coming for it's 20-30% market share. \n\n\"You severely underestimate the power of Tesla's brand, their huge investments in charging stations, and their added focus on selfless driving.\"\n\nNo I don't, Tesla has a great brand. That will successfully allow it to survive and maintain substantial market share however it will never have the type of global dominance that it's current market valuation requires. Meanwhile, VW is trading at a discount. \n\nThe point on charging stations and self-driving is just moot. VW has it's own research on self-driving cars and will have built 18,000 charging stations in the next 4 years and there's already 224,538 charging stations in the EU alone. So that's not a competitive advantage which is going to transfer to Tesla in the European market. This entire situation isn't about whether Tesla's a good company, or whether it'll survive. It's about whether it's market valuation can be sustained and whether other companies are comparatively undervalued. \n\n\"When people in China are buying EVs, they don't have VW on their mind\"\n\nAgain, VW has just invested a huge amount in Chinese production capacity last year and are planning on rolling out this year. Plus, they're already a household name in China through their various subsidiaries and historically have had a huge market share in the ICE cars market (sold 2.6m cars in China in 2020). There's a McKinsey China Auto Consumer Insights report (2019) which shows that 70% of Chinese consumers prefer German automobile companies to other brands. There's a strong  preference there for German cars, and it'll translate once VW enters the market with gusto this and next year. \n\n\"Neither do most EV buyers because Tesla is the face and rightly so. You only got upvoted because you're just throwing numbers and links at the end when your whole argument is garbage.\"\n\nThen debunk my argument. I'm getting upvotes because my argent is cogent and put together, all you have is put sentiment and I'm willing to be the reason why you're so het up is because you've been trying to find out a way to discredit my figures, and have failed. \n\n\"But they're \"poised\" to get beat by VW this year, says a retarded German VW fanboy.\"\n\nOne, never call me German again. I'm a Lancastrian. Two, if it soothes your ego to call me a fanboy sure, but I'm not emotionally connected to VW.\n\n\"Did papa Elon fuck you?\"\n\nInteresting. When you lose arguments do you often resort to homosexual fantasies? \n\n\"I can't imagine being such a retard that I'd bet against him after billionaire funds have lost money doing the same thing\"\n\nThey made the mistake of shorting Tesla, not a good idea considering it's investor profile is pickled brain apes.\n\n\"it's hilarious how much focus you're putting on European market as if it's bigger than the US\"\n\nShall I quote you the Motor1.com headline \"Europe became the worlds biggest plug-in electric car market in 2020\"? If you look at the raw statistics, sales of plug in passenger cars hit 1.4 million in Europe last year. Oh, and the biggest company in that market is VW followed by RNM.\n\n\"European carmakers are more reliant on the American market than American carmakers in Europe.\"\n\nErm, no. Can you back that up with an argument or are you just going to continue dribbling shit out of your lips like a perverted geriatric with a scat fetish? \n\n\"When Tesla has economies of scale and start producing sub $25-$30,000 EVs, no one will give a shit about VW\"\n\nStill dribbling shit I see. Newsflash, any mass manufacturer can get economies of scale! And VW has far more capacity ready to converted and built. \n\nIn short, your brain is smooth as a pearl but not half as shiny.

This is in relation to their vehicles manufactured (not necessarily delivered), which is a function of Gigafactory construction speed, and production line ramping.

I mean this is pretty basic vehicle engineering. Do you think apple would release a product where the components weren't even relatively straight??\n\nHowever, the battery tech in a Tesla is what sets it apart. But for how long? It's clear the entire industry is going electric, so can Tesla stay fashionable enough to stay relevant for long enough to start building actually decent cars? I fear that when the other OEMs have similar battery capability, which really isn't far away, the only thing to keep people buying Tesla's is the brand image. The other selling point is the ADAS capability, but other OEMs are just skipping level 2/3 until they can go balls to the wall with level 4 (when laws allow). \n\nIdk where I'm going with this, but unless Tesla can sort out their build quality, I fear they will be overtaken by traditional OEMs very quickly.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "My $43k Toyota Tundra has horrific gaps on both sides on the front panels.
