They work on contingency, or getting a percentage of the winnings if the lawsuit is successful, typically 25% or so.\n\nFor example, suppose (1) someone was injured on my company's property, and (2) the injured person sued my company for $100,000, and (3) then they won the jury trial against my company (for the purposes of this example, set aside insurance settlements, which is often what happens).  If the injured person and attorney agreed to 25% contingency, the attorney gets $25,000 as their payment.  If the injured person had lost the lawsuit, the attorney would get $0.\n\n>\n\nWhat exactly would they be compensated for?\n\nThe attorneys in the Tesla case argue that they saved Tesla's shareholders from massive dilution of shares.   Tesla would have eventually had to issue hundreds of millions of new TSLA shares (more than 300 million) to Mr. Musk upon exercise of the options.  The attorneys say they should get approximately 10% of that savings, or 29 million shares, and that dilution of 29 million shares is better than dilution of 300+ million shares.\n\n>because that would be even way more outrageous than elons comp package.\n\nIt is outrageous.  The problem I have is that this situation was entirely foreseeable on Tesla's part.  Anyone with even basic experience with corporate matters would have immediately seen the conflict of interest and fiduciary duty problems -- these were obvious, not some obscure thing.\n\nTesla's board played the whole compensation deal like they were above the law, and some ambulance chasers exploited Tesla's incompetence to maximum effect.  The board fucked this up, and they should pay for it personally, not Tesla's stockholders.\n\nPeople like Robyn Denholm cashed out hundreds of millions in TSLA stock for essentially being stooges and brain-dead rubber stampers on behalf of Musk.

Not to mention that UK/France would have to further build out their own arsenals. \n\nLike I said, proliferation is a terrifying and horrific idea. They are not easy weapons to develop and produce. It can lead to a runaway arms race that puts the whole world at greater risk for war with much higher stakes.

It provides a huge portion of the funding but the joint operations as well as strategic command and control are just as important as the equipment. Europe proliferating nuclear weapons would just provide more fuel to the fire as it creates even more uncertainty about command and control of those WMDs. Also, you think France and the UK will enter a nuclear engagement if Poland gets invaded? Not a chance unless there's a mutual defence pact like, I dunno, NATO. Impenetrable strength comes from resources and resolve of the collective, not the individual state.\n\nIf Trump wins and NATO is disbanded, Europe is in trouble no matter what. That is why there is a lot of talk about Russia waiting until a possible Trump second term. I don't see NATO going away, but I see Trump trying to minimize it in order to de-legitimize it. This may force European countries to pick up the slack and increase their defence budgets but under no circumstances should each European country have their own nuclear arsenal. Each country already has their own conventional forces to defend against a conventional invasion, but nuclear war is a completely different game. It is literally impossible to \"win\" a nuclear engagement.  All the nuclear-armed nations know this and it is the reason for the launch-on-warning policy employed by the US and the dead-man's hand used by the Russians. If one nuke is used in combat, they will all eventually be used by definition of these policies and the world literally ends as we know it.\n\nIn a perfect world, NATO waits out the Russian oligarchy and maintains a forceful front in Eastern Europe until the Russians collapse yet again under the mafia state. Russia can't and won't last forever in its current form, but strong partnerships and alliances like NATO will. The ultimate goal is to enter into a disarmament phase long term to eliminate or at least minimize to an acceptable level the ramifications of a rogue nuclear weapon being used.\n\nNATO didn't disappear under Trump V.1. It won't under Trump V.2 if it comes to that. The stakes are too high and even Trump and the Republicans wouldn't be able to pull that off.

How did that improve access to EVs?

Elon even talked about Tesla's necessity to pivot to micro controllers instead of chips during the massive chip shortage lest they be unable to deliver any cars at all. Furthermore, Tesla couldn't make enough cars at this time to satisfy demand (no other car manufacturers could deliver cars at this time). So as they detailed multiple times on earnings calls, they had to use price as a demand lever.  Being able to deliver cars at all during this period was indeed beneficial towards the transition to sustainable energy as no other manufacturer pivoted as smoothly as Tesla.\n\nAlso, Tesla cut prices drastically as parts shortages and shipping costs disappeared and demand started to wane. They made huge improvements to COGS on all their vehicles in this time and still managed to maintain positive margins while trying to reignite demand. Ironically, the IRA with its EV tax incentive also helped stimulate this demand and we seem to be seeing a resurgence in Tesla's sales (and hopefully margins).\n\nNext, Elon himself has said that the they dug their own grave with Cybertruck as it's incredibly difficult and expensive to produce. They've done a good job mitigating this by roping the simps and uber-rich in to buy the Foundation Series. But by your logic, Tesla never should have conceived a product that is initially so cost prohibitive to produce.\n\nTesla has also open-sourced a lot of its patents with respect to EV production, including a how-to guide for other OEMs to transition to a more efficient 48V architecture. This doesn't necessarily contribute to Tesla's bottom line, but it does encourage the adoption of more efficient techniques by other manufacturers and with it, the transition to sustainable energy.\n\nI wholeheartedly disagree with your assertion that a mission statement is just a platitude.

{"title": "Why I'm playing TSLA puts today", "selftext": "Guys, we have an insane earnings week and I just wanted to put in my two cents for TSLA today. \n\nHere’s what they're expecting:\n\n* Earnings per share: 62 cents expected\n\n* Revenue: $24.77 billion expected\n\nJust for comparison:  A year ago, Tesla reported 91 cents of EPS and sales of $24.9 billion. First and formost, I'm getting a put spread. Not puts. IV is just way too high for just puts. Spreads reduce the IV and focuses more on the underlying. But why puts? The stock actually PUMPED hard last earnings. Well, let me explain. \n\nLower sales volume and vehicle prices are behind the expected decline. Tesla delivered about 444,000 vehicles in the second quarter at an average realized price of $42,500. A year ago, the company shipped about 466,000 vehicles at an average price of about $44,000.\n\nThere's really no indicators telling me that they're doing better as a constant decline in sales will probably continue well into 2025. Just look at the headlines. Musk's cybertruck is a complete failure. The tesla semi is a dud. The tesla roaster isn't out and will never be out. And his other projects? Hyperloop, solar panel shingles? All busts. \n\nYea I'm expecting a >10% drop today. TSLA 7/26 240p is just a bit too expensive for an earning play, so this is why I'm getting the spread. Buying the 240p while selling the 225p (same exp) seems like a smart choice to me. I can grab the spread for 477 bucks right now at the time of writing. Meaning, if TSLA drops as much as I expect today, this spread should profit over 3x.

So the question is, when it comes to your capital investments, your AI R&D, your AI engineers, how do you make allocation decisions among these various ventures and how do you make Tesla owners comfortable that you're doing it in a way that really benefits them?

You can't just order compute -- order GPUs and turn them on, you need a data center, it's not possible.\n> \n> So I want to be clear, that was in Tesla's interest, not contrary to Tesla's interest. Does Tesla no good to have GPUs that it can't turn on. That South extension is able to take GPUs, which is really just this week. We are moving the GPUs in there and we'll bring them online.\n> \n> With regard to xAI, there are a few that only want to work on AGI. So what I was finding was that when trying to recruit people to Tesla, they were only interested in working on AGI and not on Tesla's specific problems and they want to start -- do a start-up.

I think it’s overblown, but this is the first time in a very long time that anyone is even legitimately trying to take market share from Google. If they take just 5-10% of market share, that will materially impact Google’s earnings. In my DCF calculation, I drop Google’s search growth down a lot, and I still get a strong range of investment outcomes for the business as a whole. So I’m not concerned.\n\nThe third reason is their earnings I guess. Capex spend was higher than people want, and YouTube Ads growth decelerated. They addressed that the reason for this is because more users are paying for premium. Both of these “bad” things are positives to me. I like that they’re getting more revenue from premium, and I like that they’re spending on capex.

It has bounced lately but it's still down over the last year, last five years and is flat for the last twenty years.

The iridescent, slender Zyndari greeted him with a mix of awe and revulsion.\n\n“Welcome, Elon Musk,” Zephar, their leader, intoned with barely concealed contempt.\n\nElon waved dismissively. “Yeah, yeah. Let’s get this over with.”\n\nThey paraded through the vibrant markets, the air thick with exotic spices and underlying tension. Elon sneered at a Zyndari child offering colorful fruits. “Freeloaders, even in space,” he muttered, kicking the basket aside. His eyes roved over the child, wondering what their bones might look like.\n\nThe child’s eyes filled with tears, while Zephar’s gaze hardened. Without a word, they proceeded to the grand council chamber. Negotiations were brutal, Elon’s demands issued with the subtlety of a sledgehammer.

His latest tweet, a vile tirade against another marginalized group, ignited outrage on Earth, and he relished the chaos.\n\nThat evening, Nira, an alien servant with translucent skin, entered bearing more wine. Elon’s lecherous gaze crawled over her, making her shudder. “You know,” he drawled, “I could get used to this service.”\n\n“I am here to serve, Mr. Musk,” Nira replied, her voice trembling.\n\nElon laughed, a sound devoid of humanity. “Of course you are.”\n\nAs he drained his goblet, his smirk faded.

I apologize, that was a dick move on my part. \n\nI have a 20 bagger in Tesla right now. For a while it was a 30 bagger. I’m in my 30’s and back in 2019 I put two years of my company bonus into the shares at that time, after around 9 months of owning a Model 3. At the time that investment was ~$40,000. Today, when combined with my company 401k and pension, it’s an order of magnitude more than enough money for me to retire.

Having the experience of actually owning the product helped me cut through the noise. \n\nAnyway, back to the point. I’m keep this brief, and I would love your thoughts. I see seven major growth opportunities on the short/medium term radar, in no particular order: \n\nOptimus - Production experience/AI. Humanoid robotics play.  The product has the potential to be attractive in the labor market (a very large market) by replacing dangerous/boring tasks leading to unprecedented efficiency and cost savings. Big market. \n\nRide share services - Tesla has a low-cost, massively-scalable, generalized solution for autonomous vehicles. In the past they’ve said they need more compute and more video data. Now they have both. And they’ve rewritten their software stack to feed vision as a direct input to a control based neural network. Ultimately will lower costs and increase safety of getting around. Big market. \n\nEnergy - Huge market & profitability. The stationary energy storage market is projected to experience significant growth in the coming years, driven by factors such as increased renewable energy investments, global expansion in the electric vehicle sector, and regulatory changes requiring energy efficiency. It’s a marketing expected to conservatory grow at 25% CAGR for the foreseeable future. Tesla has a competitive hardware product and bundles it with best in class software. Just look at the growth in their energy business. It’s on track to be larger than the automotive business. Big market. \n\nCompact - High production capacity. Lowering costs using their unboxed production method they are going to dramatically expand their TAM. They will be punching down market and I think they will do well. \n\nDry cathode - Reduction in costs. Significant advantages over a wet cathode battery in terms of production costs and factory space savings.  Eliminates the need for solvents, reducing the energy consumption and costs associated with solvent recovery. Also eliminates a significant portion of factory space. \n\nCybertruck - Capable offering in the electric pickup truck market. They’ve said they are tracking for profitability by the end of this year. Hitting growth phase. Big Market.\n\nSemi - Capable offering in the commercial trucking market. Expected to ramp production in 2025. Big market.\n\nYes I do see a few growth opportunities ahead.

The street is valuing the stock on that plus revenue and earnings from auto sales (the biggest chunk), which are flat to down, and likely to have a tough couple of quarters. \n\nSo in the near term, the stock is likely to drop further if auto revenues are not good, which is likely. \n\nIn the long term, we haven't seen a rollout of Tesla robotaxi yet. Will it work? Will it run into regulatory and legal issues when there are inevitable mistakes? Will they try to roll it out too fast with too little human intervention, or roll it out slowly - risk versus near term revenue - risk of first-mover self inflicted black eyes.\n\nThere is a lot of risk with FSD and robotaxis, and the software is not ready yet for fully autonomous. There has been another delay of the rollout to October. Will it be ready by then? Will it still be making mistakes? Can they get the software stable and keep it that way?\n\nElon has a history of delivering, but not on anyone's schedule.\n\nSo the street is factoring in current known problems with demand and revenue with the risk of FSD being very late, underwhelming, and other problems that can occur on the way to doing something no one has ever done before.\n\nThe TL;DR is that there is a good chance that TSLA stock will drop further, and perhaps a lot further if the auto sales crater for a few quarters. Might be a good time to pick up some shares cheaply, until Tesla can show that they have a high-profit, ready to roll robotaxi service. \n\nIf you pay attention and understand what is likely to happen, you can reduce your risk ahead of the street. I don't think they understand this stuff or how big it CAN be. I say CAN because it doesn't mean WILL be. There are still risks, and FSD has been going on for a long, long time without being quite good enough. \n\nThe analyst is right though.

I appreciate the friendly competition, good sir, and I thank you for taking the time to  summarize the first google result for \"meta earnings expectations\" for us here in wsb. But unfortunately for you, your wife's boyfriend and I will be riding these puts to fuckin Valhalla.\n\n\"CPMs are up, that's bullish\" is such an oversimplification and I get it, it makes a lot of sense when you have no actual understanding of the ads platform. Increasing prices should be a good thing, but charging too much can be bad for a business if you end up pricing out a huge chunk of your customers which is my whole argument. At the end of the day, CPMs are a vanity metric that generally don't affect decision making internally at companies. All that really matters is your return on ad dollars. CPM up 19% is still a loss if overall spend is down 25%\n\nAnd there are a lot of reasons CPMs could be up. You'll often hear meta reference the ever growing number of users. But here's the thing, when you run an ad campaign optimized for conversions, your ads aren't being shown to every single user on meta. The reality is, probably 80% of metas users are broke as fuck and never buy shit. Nobody but fuckin temu and microtransaction mobile game developers advertise to this audience.\n\nThat means meta derives most of its revenue from the other 20% of users who actually convert and who are the reason people like me spend so much fuckin money on meta. Well guess what, good sir. We're in a recession. The consumer is weakening. Karens all over the country have less disposable income to spend on my drop shit, hand crafted European textiles. Only your wife's boyfriend can afford my high end cum rags at this point cuz the dudes *fucking* ***loaded***.\n\nSo this pool of buyers, that last year was 20% of total users, may be 15% of users this year. CPMs are a supply and demand metric. This means it's not necessarily demand driving up prices, it could also be a lack of supply. If CPMs are going up due to weakening supply of converting users, aka facebook customers are having to pay more for less, the reality is that facebooks customers just start spending less because they can no longer afford to acquire customers at the increased cost. I guess I didn't clarify in my original post, but our facebook spend is down almost 30% YTD and its a similar story for many of the members of my fake network of wannabe entrepreneurs.\n\nMETAs a beast of a business. I started my company at 23 with 10k and pretty much no experience, and over 6 years have grown it into a business doing 9m in revenue. And of that 9m, Zuck keeps 40-50% of it while I get to keep 10% or less. That's a great fucking business. But there's thousands of people with similar stories, who make up a huge chunk of metas annual revenue. These people almost all unanimously agree that meta has been completely fucked up this year. Some have stopped spending entirely, some are still growing, but most that I know of are flat or down. Once my puts print, I'll roll half of them into META shares because its a great long term hold. But Metas core product is failing right now, you know, the one that generates all the revenue. Advertisers are spending less.

{"title": "CrowdStrike shares plunge 11%  on report that Delta may seek damages ", "selftext": "CrowdStrike shares fell tumbled 11% on Tuesday to their lowest level of the year following a report that Delta Air Lines hired prominent attorney David Boies to seek damages from the security software vendor.\n\nCrowdStrike fell $28.98 to $228.83 as of early afternoon trading. The company has now lost one-third of its value since July 19, when a historic outage of Microsoft systems, caused by a software update from CrowdStrike, knocked numerous industries offline, including airlines.\n\nLate Monday, CNBC’s Phil Lebeau reported that Delta hired Boies, chairman of Boies Schiller Flexner, to seek compensation from CrowdStrike and Microsoft. No suit has been filed, Lebeau reported, and Delta didn’t respond to a request for comment.\n\nDelta is handling over 176,000 refund or reimbursement requests after almost 7,000 flights were canceled. The outages cost the airline an estimated $350 million to $500 million. \n\nThe Department of Transportation said last week that it’s investigating Delta due to the widespread flight disruptions and service failures.\n\nBoies is known for representing the U.S. government in its landmark antitrust case against Microsoft and for helping win a decision that overturned California’s ban on gay marriage. He also worked with Harvey Weinstein, the imprisoned former Hollywood mogul, and Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes, who is currently serving a prison sentence for defrauding investors.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/30/crowdstrike-shares-plunge-11percent-on-report-that-delta-may-seek-damages.html", "id": "1eg3dei", "created_utc": 1722370291.0, "score": 1738, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 315, "comments": [{"body": "Wait til all the other airlines hop on this one", "score": 755, "replies": [{"body": "Wait until every single business jumps in on this", "score": 444, "replies": [{"body": "Even if the terms of service hold up in court (which I don't think they will), CrowsStrike simply can't afford to fight half of the Fortune 500 in court at the same time.
