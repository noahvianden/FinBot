You can't compare Tesla's EV sales to ICE sales because at that point, you're negating the fact that Tesla spent over a decade of hard work that other automanufacturers refused to do. From 2004-2016, these automanufacturers didn't take EV seriously. Now, they're playing catch up. \n\n* Margins for EV's are higher. Particularly, Tesla has the highest gross margins in the business with their upcoming 10K expected to show 28% gross margins. \n* Tesla leads in battery innovation with the lowest cost per kwH. Most expensive piece of equipment in an EV is the battery.\n* Tesla giga stamping is revolutionary for auto-engineering. Reduces costs significantly and results in an easier manufacturing process. Sandy Munro talks about this and how he and other auto engineers have been pushing for 1/2 piece chassis for some time but that the legacy automanufacturers were resistant to change.\n* Too much concern about P/E from amateurs. Just 18 months ago, their P/E was negative. 12 months ago, it was 1,200. They ended last year with a P/E ratio hovering around 330. By the end of this year (2022), their P/E is expected to hover around 120. You might be thinking, 'but that's still too high.' Fair. What I will ask of you is to please name me an EV maker that is profitable selling EV's because again, if you refuse to acknowledge that EV =/= ICE sales, you are lost in this entire discussion already. No amount of data I show you will ever convince you if you think the production of EV's are the same as ICE. \n* One simple fact of statement is when GM, Ford, Volkswagen, Volvo, and other car manufacturers tell you they plan on going fully EV by 2030-2040, it should tell you just how serious this EV transition is. What they won't tell you is that many auto manufacturers are going to end up going bankrupt or be consolidated.\n* People keep saying it is baked in. Based on what? You have no data. Show the data. Saying it's baked in without any data can be said about any stock. In the corporate world, try telling your boss, \"Man, it's baked in already\" with no data. \n* Tesla scaling has been on some revolutionary shit. Their Shanghai factory opened just two years ago. It's now pumping over 500k EV's per year. Again, what RoPrime12 fails to mention, whether intentionally or ignorantly, is that Tesla's manufacturing process is significantly more efficient than other car manufacturers because EV's require fewer parts (average is 25 moving parts compared to thousands in an ICE) and because of their giga stamping and heavy use of robotics and AI, the efficiency of the manufacturing is something to behold. Plus, since Tesla manufacturers many of the parts themselves instead of outsourcing like the legacy manufacturers, they have a much better supply chain control.\n\nI didn't even mention their software advantages, supercharging network, or the fact that that Tesla (as well as GM) don't offer any federal tax credits in the USA but Tesla continues dominating the EV sales in the USA.

At that point you might have half or more of the market be EVs, but the other big automakers will be in the EV market in a much more serious way.  Tesla will almost certainly be facing very stiff competition unless they can make a much better vehicle or have a much better price.  Both will cost them in profit margin.  Tesla will get more price efficiencies but so will other manuifacturers,  These efficiencies totally normal for auto manufacturers, but prices do not drop because they have to keep making the cars better to compete for market share.\n\nSomeday I think Tesla might hit about 10 million in sales (out of roughly 100 million globally) which will make them an auto giant.  But to put it in perspective that is \"only\" about the size of Toyota today, and Toyota's market cap is only about 250B.  So if Tesla wants to grow into even just their current valuation they are probably going to need to get most of their value from things on top of EV sales.  Even if we're generous and assume they can be double that and get 20 million in sales that's still a long way from their current valuation.\n\nAnd that's where I have trouble with Tesla's valuation.

Software businesses like Facebook can double sales because they just need to add more capacity in data centres. For a car manufacturer, it’s infinitely harder as they need more land, raw materials, tooling, staff etc etc. \n\nBut you know what? The crazy mofos always seem to pull it off. Tesla shorts lost more than US airlines in 2020.\n\nSo I agree that there are huge challenges. I agree it seems unlikely given what other auto manufacturers can manage.

All of ARK’s other ETFs, including the latest, ARK Transparency (CTRU)—launched in December—are also deep in negative territory.  \n\nGrowth stocks fell on Wednesday after the latest minutes from the Federal Reserve’s December policy meeting were released, suggesting that the central bank’s rate increases might be earlier and faster than market has expected. \n\nInvestors were spooked as Fed Chairman Jerome Powell shifted his tone to emphasize the risks of inflation—after months of describing rising prices as “transitory”—as a new Covid-19 variant is rampaging across the country and causing supply-chain disruptions.\n\nThe S&P 500 lost 2% in the last two hours of Wednesday’s trading, growth stocks within the index tumbled 3%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped 3.3%. \n\nBut the ARK ETFs were some of the worst-performing funds amid Wednesday’s decline. Besides ARK Innovation, ARK Genomic Revolution (ARKG) was down 7.1%, ARK Fintech Innovation (ARKF) dropped 6.6%, and ARK Next Generation Internet (ARKW) fell 6.2%. Other groups of growth stocks, such as blockchain, cannabis, clean energy, and technology, were also deep in the red. \n\nWednesday’s loss was just the latest stretch of ARK funds’ year-long struggle. ARK ETFs were some of the best-performing funds in 2020, soaring an average of 150% as the pandemic accelerated the adoption of many emerging platforms and technologies that companies in its portfolios own.\n\nSince peaking in February 2021, however, the funds have been tumbling downhill, shedding much of their gains from the year before. Rising inflation has made the future cash flow of growth-oriented innovation firms less valuable today, and investors were seeking returns from safer corners, such as cheaply traded cyclical stocks.\n\nWith the Fed’s hawkish pivot, it looks like the volatility in growth stocks and ARK funds will continue. But if inflation can be somewhat contained following the Fed’s tightening policy in 2022, innovation stocks might embrace some rebound—though that won’t be anytime soon.", "id": "rx3i2u", "created_utc": 1641437674.0, "score": 654, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 326, "comments": [{"body": "With investing there's never any patience from the masses.

The federal government looks increasingly deadlocked, and the Fed is displaying its monolithic tendencies by committing to numerous rate hikes and to monetary tightening in the face of an economic slowdown. The slowdown is apparent in the most recent economic data and in the simple fact that there was a significant consumption binge even during the pandemic despite supply constraints and the resulting high prices. Once the binge cools off, slowdown begins. That time is now.\n\nIt's an easy 20-30% down from here if the Fed carries through with its plan and proceeds with rate hikes in the face of a slowing economy. China has sensed this and warned against excessively tight policy in the West, since any resulting recession will shrink export demand while China itself is struggling economically.\n\nI'd expect the Fed to reverse policy quickly once it realizes its mistake, I would guess after about six months or so. But, before that, I'm expecting a sudden economic contraction and financial market chaos similar to what happened in 1920, after the last great pandemic and the end of the first world war.\n\nIf you think the bubble/tech/meme stocks are cheap now, expect some major bargains should this scenario come to pass.\n\nFor now, my suggestions: dollars, gold, eventually bonds, consumer staples and utilities for short-term trades on dips.

That rapid recovery of the overall American Economy results in 1 thing: inflation. To combat this, they will raise rates and cause multiple corrections and even bear traps.

The Federal Reserve is responsible for the rates specifics and the Government is responsible for the overall economy so keep that in mind. They are doing whats best for the economy and in turn whats best for their jobs. They only cut supply off because of inflation. If the supply chain was stronger, the Fed would never have raised rates. It is in their best interest for a steady growth in the stock market with as little inflation as possible without deflation.

In fact, banks have been parking $1.5 trillion at the reverse repo facility.  When they raise rates they'll pay higher interest on the reverse repo.  So it's free money to huge banks.  The $1.5 trillion is also proof that they've printed way more money than necessary to support the economy.\n\nPartly devil's advocate again - probably one of the reasons they've done so much QE is that if they didn't buy the bonds, there's a chance that nobody would (at least not at these yields).  That would mean that unless politicians can agree to balance a budget, deficit spending will 1) pull money out of private investment and 2) raise market yields on bonds, stocks, real estate...  basically crash everything.

Well I imagine that things like appreciation or other outside factors can keep the balance sheet growing faster or keeping pace with the reduction of the purchasing rate.However more importantly none of this is that big a deal since these smooth brainers still don't understand that real rates are continuing negative, possibly quicker than any proposed hikes, so money is actually probably still getting easier and looser and not tighter despite the fake appearance.

Again I haven't personally check this myself but it seems to be the disconnect you may be having, or maybe what I'm saying is nonsense though I'm not sure why it would be.\n\nI agree with inflation however from the prospective of a bond investor and the government they really don't seem to care.

One of the most uncomfortable professional experiences we have ever had was watching him eviscerate Jeremy Siegel of Wharton (Stocks for the Long Run) in a debate. Jeremy Grantham won the debate, but the performance of stocks has probably resembled more closely the long-term expectations of Jeremy Siegel.\n\nFor those who didn’t see Jeremy Grantham’s press appearances last week, he is predicting that we are at the end of a superbubble in stocks, bonds, real estate and commodities.

This is based on a return of valuations two-thirds of the way back toward norms.\n\n \n\nWe don’t debate his conclusion that there has been bubble-type behavior in markets since the pandemic. But we would describe them as occurring more in sub-asset classes than in the broad markets. Areas such as money-losing IPOs, meme stocks, cryptocurrencies (e.g., those created as a joke and gaining billion-dollar-plus market caps) and high growth speculative stocks have all inflated and then had rolling deflations. As noted in the equity commentary above, the broad technology sector doesn’t appear to be in a bubble. For the broad stock market to be in a bubble that will deflate like Jeremy G. predicts, one or two things will likely need to occur: (1) A crash in the economy; or (2) A big jump in interest rates. We don’t see either across the tactical (12-month) or strategic (5-year) horizon.
