{"title": "$TSLA National Adopt A Bear Day - 2023", "selftext": "Once upon a time, there was a CC bear named John who loved investing in TSLA. He was an experienced trader and had a good understanding of various trading strategies.\n\nOne day, John came across an opportunity to write a covered call option on TSLA. He decided to sell the call option as he thought the stock price was unlikely to go up much further. The premium he received for selling the call option was a nice boost to his portfolio.\n\nWeeks passed, and the stock price remained relatively stable. However, John started to hear rumors about a major product announcement by the company that could send the stock price soaring. He dismissed these rumors and felt confident that he had made the right decision to write the covered call option.\n\nOn the day of the product announcement, John was shocked to see the stock price skyrocketing. It was up by over 50%, and he had missed out on huge upside potential. He realized that he had underestimated the market's reaction to the news and had made a costly mistake.\n\nJohn felt frustrated and disappointed that he had missed out on such a big opportunity. He had believed that he had a good understanding of the stock and the market, but he had been wrong.\n\nJohn learned a valuable lesson about the stock market that day. He realized that even experienced traders can make mistakes and that it's important to stay informed about the companies in which he invests. He also learned that sometimes, it's better to hold on to a stock and not write covered call options if there's a chance of a major announcement that could significantly impact the stock price.\n\nFrom that day forward, John made a commitment to stay up-to-date with company news and be more cautious when it comes to writing covered call options. While he missed out on a huge opportunity, he gained a valuable lesson that would help him make better investment decisions in the future.\n\nJohn's name was change in the interest of privacy.\n\n\\-----\n\nThese guys need some love. They come out on red days and are fearful on green ones. They sign up for the free money and become bitter when the premium isn't worth the squeeze.\n\nAdopt one today. Take them under your wing and give them the precious guidance that only bulls know.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s4mxoiwik5ra1.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dfac2e78be1213883be40eb4c2f8e25029eb00d3", "id": "1287rlf", "created_utc": 1680314424.0, "score": 52, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 311, "comments": [{"body": "[Tesla tweeted](https://twitter.com/Tesla/status/1642162058258001920): Cybertruck crash test https://t.co/MIhJbxLXuP", "score": 17, "replies": [{"body": "![gif](giphy|xT0Gquis7l8OwC2hRm|downsized)", "score": 9, "replies": []}, {"body": "Still got good CT shots, not even mad!", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Also crash testing means sales are coming", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "Are you implying this thing is real!?", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "![gif](giphy|RTfIwAFTKf9HDOI0cL)", "score": 5, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "![gif](giphy|U1aN4HTfJ2SmgB2BBK)", "score": 9, "replies": []}, {"body": "This is hilarious.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "🤣", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "![gif](giphy|a8DfVAblirrOg)", "score": 5, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "![gif](giphy|MwOuiiTfWfWgM|downsized)", "score": 8, "replies": []}, {"body": "Good to see them working on that", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "What would happen if a Cybertruck crashed into another Cybertruck?", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "atomic detonation", "score": 7, "replies": []}, {"body": "The Earth would flip on its axis.", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "It would create a black hole.", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "dude wtf, ban", "score": 4, "replies": []}, {"body": "The original is better", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "April fools is a tradition that needs to die", "score": 17, "replies": [{"body": "💯", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "yeah hate april fools", "score": 4, "replies": []}, {"body": "TSLA bought 10 billion worth of dogecoin", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Why?

Many of my investment principles are Boglehead in origin -- meaning that I stay on course and stick to the plan through up or down volatility. \n\nElon's decision to purchase Twitter, and the chaos that ensued in 2022, has made me re-think the wisdom of my plans.  \n\nI didn't sell when I was up 200x, and I didn't sell when TSLA plunged 75% from ATH.  I stuck to my plan, just like the late Jack Bogle (founder of Vanguard Group) had advised for decades.  \n\nThe fundamental question for me now is whether I want to keep sticking around with TSLA.  It's not fun to stomach 75% drop in asset value that was 80% of my portfolio, just because Elon decided to have fun with Twitter without any regard for Tesla shareholders, and our do-nothing board was silent.  \n\nPoint (3) of my plan is that I rebalance when the asset allocation becomes uncomfortable, and I am reaching the point where I have no trust that Elon won't do something stupid again.

They literally couldn't shut my group down if they wanted to stay in business.  The business also continued to be profitable through the recession.\n\nNow that I'm retired, I find that without job or business income, I am more concerned about portfolio fluctuations.  2022 wasn't a practical problem for me, since I exited 2021 with close to a decade's worth of living expenses in cash.  \n\nHowever, I don't want to be in a situation 10 years from now where I don't have steady cash flow, but am still 10-12 years out from collecting Social Security, and can't withdraw from IRAs without major tax penalties.

Sometimes a bear market comes without a recession (1987) and the recession that follows (1991) has no bear market at all. Sometimes a recession comes with no accompanying bear market (1980) until it double dips (1981). Sometimes the market just trades sideways (1953). Sometimes the market keeps chugging along despite a recession (1945).

You would have sold low at inversion in 1989, bought high at un-inversion in 1990, and still experienced the full dip from the recession later that year. This goes back to my other comment about the yield curve having no real correlation to the timing, depth, or length of market downturns.\n\n**It's also not just one example. The yield curve is not a consistent predictor of anything related to the stock market:**\n\n* Look at the double dip recession. The 10-3 first inverted in late 1978 with the S&P 500 around 96 and pretty much stayed inverted for 3 years. The market continued to rise for 2 years (up to 140) before *finally* beginning to drop in late 1980. The 10-3 un-inverted around Aug 1981, but the market didn't bottom for another year, around Aug 1982. That bottom was still well above the 1978 market when the inversion first occurred.\n   * Takeaway: the inversion could happen *years before* there is any real market impact and the market 'bottom' could be well above where it was when inversion first occurred... there is almost no way a 10-3 DCA timing strategy comes out ahead in that recession.\n* Look at 2000-2001... 10-3 yield curve un-inverted in Apr 2001 and the market continued declining for another 2 years.\n   * Takeaway: the market could continue declining for *years after* the un-inversion occurs... a 10-3 DCA timing strategy could have come out ahead, but are you going to continue buying into a declining market when your inclination is to try to time it?\n* Look at 2006-2007... the yield curve inverted in summer 2006 and un-inverted around May 2007, while the market continued climbing until December 2007.\n   * Takeaway: the inversion and un-inversion could both begin and end while the market just keeps chugging along upward... a 10-3 DCA timing strategy would have sold low, bought high, and felt the full brunt of the recession, just like in 1990.\n\nSo you have four recessions in the last 45 years (ignoring 2020 because that was primarily COVID-related) and every single one of them followed a different pattern in relation to the timing of yield curve inversion, recession, and market declines.

But that 'bottom' was higher than when the inversion first occurred. Not exactly helpful in either case.\n\nThe other big issue is timing. In 1974 the un-inversion occurred pretty much right as the market reached a bottom. In 1981 and in 2000 it un-inverted while a decline was actively happening, but over a year before the bottom was actually reached. In 1990, 2007, and 2020 it un-inverted well before the decline even began.\n\nI'm not saying there isn't a pattern. I'm saying the details are so wildly variable that there is nothing really actionable.\n\nThe 10-3 is currently inverted. That doesn't tell us much unless you somehow know the answers to the following:\n\n* *Will the market begin declining before or after it un-inverts?* 1974, 1981, and 2000 say before. 1990, 2007, and 2020 say after. 1978 says it won't decline at all.\n* *If it declines before the un-inversion, how long will it continue after un-inversion?* 1974 says it will stop declining immediately. 1981 and 2000 say it could take years.\n* *How long will the downturn last?* 1978 says it won't decline at all. 1990 and 2020 say it will be months. 1981 says it will be about a year. 1974, 2000, and 2007 say it will be multiple years.\n* *Will the bottom actually be lower than what we saw before the inversion?* 1974, 2000, 2007, and 2020 say yes. 1978, 1981, and 1990 say no.\n\nSo basically we know nothing. If it's like 1978, we don't start declining until 2025 and the recovery happens swiftly in 2027. If it's like 2020, we have a flash decline this year and are fully recovered in a matter of months. If it's like 2007, we will un-invert this year and have the grandaddy of all crashes sometime in 2024, finally recovering in 2029.

But see here:\n\nhttps://www.statista.com/chart/28401/annual-returns-of-the-sp-500/\n\n“Historically, back-to-back down years are a very rare occurrence, as our chart shows. According to Macrotrends.net, the S&P 500 has only seen consecutive years of negative returns three times since 1957, in 1973/1974 and in 2001/2002/2003 with returns getting worse in the second (and third) down year on each of those occasions. Since 1957, the S&P 500 has ended the year in the red 18 times including 2022. On 14 occasions, the index returned to growth the next year.\nAnd while history might point to an upbeat 2023 – on average the S&P 500 gained 15 percent in years following a negative year”", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "2 problems with this:\n\nFirst, why 1957?  That’s not many data points on a yearly chart.   As you pointed out elsewhere, it’s arguable that we should even go back before 2020 when discussing the current market regime, but if you’re gonna use a yearly timeframe, more data points is better.\n\nSecond, that 5% figure is ignoring Bayes’ Theory of probability.  It’s equivalent to saying, “the coin was heads last time, and the odds of two flips being heads are only 25%, therefore the odds of this next flip being heads are 25%.”  Obviously that’s not true.  The odds are still 50%.\n\nSimilarly, if the odds of any given year being down are about 25%, then the odds of down years happening twice in a row are 6% (0.25 x 0.25).  Which roughly matches your 5% number, given the small sample size.\n\nBut that doesn’t make the odds of a down year, once you were already down the year before, 6%.  The odds would still be 25%.\n\nAnd in fact, going back to 1970, there were 12 down years through 2021 and 3 of those were followed by another down year.\n\nAnd 3/12 is, unsurprisingly, 25%.\n\nHowever this is the simplest and crudest possible statistical study.  If you want more realism, your model would need to look at valuations, economic conditions and many other things.\n\nAt present there are positive and negative indicators, and you have to figure out which lead and which lag, and which are correlated vs just being random noise.\n\nMy opinion, based on zooming very far out and on subjective synthesis of everything I can find, is that broad US equities are not likely to have meaningfully positive real returns over the next 5-10 years.\n\nSimilar to the conditions under which SPX failed to produce positive returns in >10 year periods following 2000 (~13 years), 1967 (~15 years), and 1929 (~25 years).  And none of those periods started with overall real asset valuations (across equities, CRE, housing and bonds) anywhere near where they are now.\n\nThis isn’t what I want to be the case, but to me desiring something doesn’t mean living in fantasy land and cherry-picking positive-appearing metrics.\n\nI have no idea when momentum stops and mean reversion kicks in.

Its stupid.\n\nBTC on the other hand has no such quibbles, and it says it doesn't pay a dividend. But, it does allow you to send money to people overseas without paying duties, it allows you to not have to worry about inflation, and it can be used as collateral for a loan. That last part is important, because you can take out a loan of two seperate stable coins against your btc and place them in stablecoin pools to generate a 5% yield, while servicing the loan costs 1-2%. Tada, now your btc is paying dividends of around 2% per year.\n\nRegardless, btc has more inherent value than the majority of non dividend paying stonks, and if btc can crash 90%, the stock market sure as hell can. The only reason it hasn't, is cause the boomers would lose their collective minds if it did, and jerome powell has been given the printer from hell to print money to pamp the market up. But he didt hat the last few years, and now the powers that be are giving him the frowny face, and he has been having to raise interest rates.\n\nThe boomers are gonna get liquidated and die penniless, like they should, cause they have been sucking the money off the economy like ticks draining a cow.

Commodities peaked second half of 2022 then had a broad steep decline but have been up recently off their lowers and appear to be moderating once again.\n\nSo Tesla's BOM/COGS should be lower in 2023 vs 2022 (on average) as commodities deflation makes its way through the income statement. And this should help offset some prioce reductions.\n\nWhat i think is interesting is to look at Sandy Mundro and Associates' estimates from 2018 vs 2022 here: [https://insideevs.com/news/632506/sandy-munro-tesla-price-annihilate-competitors/](https://insideevs.com/news/632506/sandy-munro-tesla-price-annihilate-competitors/)\n\nIn 2018 they estimated the COGS of a Model 3 LR at $33.6k. In 2022 they estimated  Model Y LR COGS at $39.4k, which is $6k higher. Even though the Model Y is 10% larger than the Model 3, it doesn't need 10% more materials so the COGS should be roughly the same all else being equal.\n\nSo if Tesla reduced COGS by 30% vs 2018, today's M3 RWD would cost around $22K to produce in 2018 commodity prices... which is insane when you think about it. It also shows that commodities inflation is probably responsible for a more than 50% or $10k rise in COGS.\n\nBut as i pointed out above, those commodity prices are coming back down and they still have a ways to go before reaching 2018's prices. When they do, Tesla recaptures all of that margin which could be potentially massive. What's unclear is how quickly commodity prices flow through the income statement. I'm certain there's a lag, how much though? I don't know. But what i do know is if (or when) commodity prices settle back to pre-pandemic levels, Tesla's margins will reverse higher - much higher.", "score": 73, "replies": [{"body": "Unfortunately commodity prices are coming down due to the coming recession, which won’t be good for car sales.", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah but if you can lock in some long term contracts then that’ll help Tesla into better years", "score": 11, "replies": []}, {"body": "Thought we had a recession already?

Might be a certain indication for the long run but nothing more", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Maybe not but we can infer a signifcant impact to COGS from inflation based on Mundro Associates 2018 estimates, 2023 Average COGS deduced from income statement, and the very interesting chart Tesla provided in the Q1 earnings report  indicating a 30% reduction in COGS on an adjusted basis. \n\nPlus, these long-term contracts are renewed over time at new prices, and/or typically have adjustable clauses for force-majeure type events (like COVID). During COVID it's also probable that a number of suppliers for materials and/or parts were unable to actually meet their contractual obligations due to shutdowsn which could have forced Tesla to buy some things at spot prices from other suppliers who could deliver.\n\nAnyway, it's interesting to note that in the Q1 report Tesla highlighted higher materials, commoditites, and logistics costs on YoY basis as a negative impact to revenues/earnings. This is notable because if you look at spot commodity prices you'll notice most commodities peaked in the second quarter of 2023 and (as i pointed out above) are 20-40% lower today on a YoY basis. Yet Tesla's COGS are higher YoY. This is the lag i'm talking about. Clearly the materials in cars being made today were paid for or bought at higher prices than last year. And those higher prices are almost a year ago now.\n\nSo going forward, it's likely that COGS will decline from materials deflation. But it will take time for that to impact the income statement. We're already seeing some impact though on a QoQ basis, and they said we would see more next quarter. And I imagine this will probably continue well into next year if commodities continue deflating to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nFocus on the chart Tesla provided. They said they cut COGS by 30% on a Model 3 on an inflation-adjusted basis. This means if commodities return to 2018 prices, Tesla's COGS on a China-made Model 3 would probably be around $22k (assuming Munro's estimate is relatively accurate).", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Great comment.\n\nBut why the assumption that commodity prices will go back down to 2018 prices? At first glance that seems no different than assuming house prices will go back to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nSome commodity inflation came from disrupted supply chains. But some of it also came from money printing. And some of the prices in EV specific materials (like lithium) could continue upwards due to EV production and competition.\n\nHave you done enough research to say which factors are dominant in this case?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I think there's too many specifics to really thuroughly research and make a definitive conclusion.\n\nBut if you zoom way out, in my opinion at least, i believe most of the \"inflation\" during the pandemic was directly the result of forced shutdowns. Forced shutdowns of factories and production caused supply shortages of everything, from materials, to commoditites, to micro-chips. And at the same time the ultra-low interest rates and free money from government stimulus programs helped to prop up demand for products and services, especially for finance loans for homes and cars. Work from home orders in particular drove up demand for computors/laptops which worsened the chip shortage (but this was also a non-recurring event).\n\nBut this wasn't a natural shift in supply or demand, it was artificial. The \"norm\" was pre-pandemic, and that is what i believe we will be returning to. Of course, there are \\*some\\* materials like Lithium or Nickel which have (as a result of increased EV production) seen real demand increase since 2018. And prices on those materials may be materially higher until supply catches up. But i also believe there is plenty of supply of those materials in the earth, and supply will catch up to demand.\n\nLook at Lithium for example, it's allready closer to 2018 prices than it is to it's 2021-2022 peak. Similarly, more new Nickel mines are being opened rapidly in Indonesia and this isn't the first time Nickel prices have been this high. In 2007 and again in 2011, Nickel prices were as high or higher than today but look at where they ended up a couple years later. So i doubt this time will be any different.\n\nAnd i guess i have one last observation on inflation and the growth in money supply due to all the stimulus. You know, alot of people like to parrot this idea that inflation was created by all the new money pumped into the economy by the government, but if that were the case, then why didn't all the stimulus from 2009 keep materials and commodity prices permanetly higher? Alot of metals (like Nickel, Aluminium, Steel) bottomed out during the recession in 2009, peaked a couple years later in 2011, but by 2015 they were back to their 2008 lows.\n\nSo, i think it's pretty clear the money supply doesn't control commodity prices as much as supply/demand does, which is in turn controlled by interest rates/economic conditions. In 2009, commodity/materials prices bottomed due to what was a severe recession, high unemployment, etc which severely depressed economic activity (home building, car buying etc). The FED dropped interest rates and pumped a bunch of money into the economy. Economic activity ecentually turned up, and as a result demand for commodities recovered and so did their prices. But dropping rates to near zero doesn't permanently increase demand, it's like a sugar high. Everyoen tries to take advantage of it all at once at the start, and then once everyone has got their loans and bought cars/homes, it doesn't matter if rates are near zero... demand eventually trails off. And that's what you see in commodity prices.\n\nWhat's interesting is that the FED didn't start raising rates until 2016. So despite the fact that interest rates were basically held near zero from 2009-2016, you had this boom bust cycle in commoditites which was probably due to supply and demand. First a lack of demand during the recession, then a spike in demand thanks to record low interest rates (the sugar high), and then finally following the spike in prices was probably a spike in supply and/or a dip in demand which brought prices back down.", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "2018 is when they were first ramping model 3 production (not getting economies of scale) and only producing in California (significantly higher labor costs).
