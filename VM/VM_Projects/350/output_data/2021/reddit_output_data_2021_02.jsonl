It's February 2020 and Tesla raised a secondary at $2 billion. Let's also remember the Tesla narrative at that time. For most of 2019, Elon vigorously stated that he had no intention of raising capital. Wall Street kept asking and he kept replying \"NO!\". And yet he ended up doing so... Many investors were puzzled and couldn't understand why the company would do that. Now, let's also remember the broader narrative at the time one year ago. Democrats were trying to impeach Trump and oh that virus going around in China is just the flu. One month later, the entire world went into lockdown over Covid-19. People started mobbing stores to buy toilet paper and the Pope was giving prayer in an empty Vatican. Now investors began to realize why the $2 billion secondary happened and why it was a good move. Having extra cash during an economic crisis is a good idea. Come to present day. Trump is getting impeached again, more stimulus is coming, the vaccines are coming and we're going back to normal. And why the hell did Tesla invest billions in Bitcoin?\n\nI am by no means an economist. All I know is that the money printers worked like crazy last year and yet all we have gotten so far are zombie companies and stonks. But let's just imagine the Tesla board making this decision to buy Bitcoin. Remember, $1.5 billion is a lot of money. They're looking at the future and trying to make moves for the benefit of the company. Without delving too much into Bitcoin, the only serious reason I can see them purchasing this much Bitcoin is as a hedge against inflation. Why don't all companies do this? Well, Bitcoin is a new concept and companies will have a tough time explaining to their investors. Boomers simply don't understand it. Tesla investors are a bit different. They are the black sheep doing a Naruto run down Wall Street.\n\nThis is just a hunch.

Instead ... they are silent, and there were only price target upgrades.\n\nAlso note the serious bifurcation of price targets: there's the cluster of very low $300-ish price targets, and the $1,000-ish price targets. This kind of polarization of Wall Street consensus is very rare for megacap companies like Tesla - I'd say it's unprecedented. Usually the price targets are ***much*** more tightly clustered.\n\nThis means, as a practical consequence, that if one of the ~4 remaining bearish analysts capitulates and boosts their price target, that will result in the capitulation of all the bearish clients they had influence over. 1 out of 4 is a 25% catalyst.

The mods of this community are distracting from the issue for why nearly every core member of this sub has joined the new one.\n\nI did not start the exodus. I was literally surprised by it.

They left because they are upset with the way that the mods govern this community, handing out bans for minor things and being pretty controlling. \n\nAt the beginning of this entire phenomenon I did request that they make several of the core users who left mods so that we can countermand corinthian And others. That was a poorly thought out request, because Its not like the core users are somehow in charge. \n\nI think the best solution is two fold. First, for the mods here to hold elections using a website that allows for public displays of poll information. Allow folks to run, allow them to state their case, because clearly this community needs more input from its users as evident in the current schism. \n\nSecond, I encourage the mods to go over to the new sub and talk to people about why they are dissatisfied. \n\nI have messaged with corinthian and others a few times and they keep on mentioning that somehow I caused this breach because I want Memes/ gifs. It is true that I was one of the demands I put out there at first, but I realized that that‚Äôs just my personal want, not what‚Äôs best for the community, what‚Äôs best for the community is a snap election and whoever becomes a mod can make some new rules.\n\nWhile moderation has never really been a democratic thing, there is absolute precedent for popular discontent to lead to leadership changes within his sub.

The instinctual value would be 50%, but due to the amount of lurkers that should be discussed.\n\n2) Making a secret-ballot format on the internet is a terrible, terrible idea. Otherwise we'd end up with /u/Moddy-Mc-ModFace. No offence to them. This offers the potential worry of people being targeted for their choices, but we could also try to set up something where only subscribers are capable of voting, but past that it's unknown.\n\n3) Brigading would remain a real threat, as often happens to subreddits in times of confusion. Probably the easiest way to remove this threat is to require anyone being voted for must have a history of subreddit interaction.

{"title": "Fintel's constantly changing stats for AMC", "selftext": "I've been following fintel's reports for quite some time - way before I knew about AMC and GME.\n\nTheir reports have been quite accurate, but recently I've been noticing some shady activity that has made me raise an eyebrow.\n\nTo preface, I am usually not a conspiracy person myself. Even with all the weird movements this past week, I would not like to shout \"market manipulation\" until I'm completely sure there's something going on. Ironically, all this shady changes have been happening right before dissemination day (02/09/2021).\n\nThe first one I would like to point one is the one that makes the most sense to me:\n\nMy screenshot (02/05/2021):\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/laf5lci10fg61.jpg?width=1072&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a6849c1c430c3d2878213a1ee7dfc87b2eaba47b\n\nCurrent report (02/08/2021):\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xk8hlhj30fg61.png?width=453&format=png&auto=webp&s=b8aba006b33a4b703ca7eee7ed856f553a80dc98\n\nThe short volume ratio dropped drastically (twice). The second time it dropped is what you can see in the second image - i.e. the current report on Fintel. For the first drop, unfortunately, I don't have an image to prove it. But, what I do remember is that for the 3rd of February the percentage was 53% rather than 27%.\n\nRegardless, what you can notice is that there is a noticeable change. This one I'm willing to blame on \"updating data\".\n\nI presume short volume is not as simple to track as most of us believe and there is probably a large number of elements that can either spoof a system into believe that the numbers are much higher.\n\nHowever, one thing that we can notice is (if this were true) how often Fintel updates their stats. My screenshot was on the 5th of Feb, and the current one (8th of Feb). This shows that Fintel has updated their stats twice in the span of 3/4 days.\n\nRight, where things start to get fishy is when we look at the historical values of short volume over the past year.\n\nMy screenshot (02/06/2021):\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gmcdpj160fg61.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c0ee6ebdc7c597af71e347af5e07492fcb73fb9d\n\nCurrent report (02/08/2021):\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uildby970fg61.png?width=890&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe9284081630cd1b25087b0fe69abaa112e7eaf3\n\nAs you can see the first screenshot I had taken shows that during there was a higher short volume in February compared to prior months. This was after the first correction that I had mentioned previously (the one I don't have a screenshot for).\n\nIn April of 2020, in the first screenshot the average short volume was recorded to be about 45% and now it's showing it to be above 85%. And February of 2021 is showing to be one of the lowest short volumes.\n\nI get the short volume being updated regularly for day values. But for historical data? Especially with such a huge change? And all of this came out a few days before dissemination day?\n\nThere was a person on Stocktwits who claimed that he got his subscription cancelled, automatically, after reaching out to Fintel to ask them why are their numbers changing so rapidly and so often.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ld1mxyo90fg61.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a4774a3d9b9e2766576004cc50666ac9d5cfbcff\n\nHere's the email he received.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s04tukbb0fg61.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=812fbfea028d41767684ceef6e2c7eb65a87d5d7\n\nAgain, there might be a lot more complexities behind short volume calculations. But all of this seems like more than a coincidence.\n\nThoughts.\n\nP.S I'm not a financial advisor just a smooth brained ape who doesn't like what he sees.\n\nP.S.P.S I'm still holding strong!\n\nEdit: A lot of people were asking what does this mean. It doesn't mean anything per se. It just shows that there is some odd movement happening with Fintel's platform. One of the top comments pointed out a conversation he had with Fintel:\n\n\"Thanks so much for reaching out to Fintel with your concern! You are right. Given the recent market activity we wanted to implement more data sources as a check, to gain a richer overview of stocks. Given this, we have revised some historical numbers. We announced this in the Welcome Group and on those pages. Sorry the message wasn‚Äôt up for longer - I imagine that was super confusing. We will replace it again. I imagine many subscribers did get to see it.\n\nAre you certain the chart isn‚Äôt updating? That is an automated process. I appreciate you writing in so I could clarify. I‚Äôll resolve your ticket but I‚Äôm still here if you reply.\"\n\nI mean, this is possible. However, why now? Why after a year do they decide to go ahead an say \"oh yeah, let's update these statistics so we can show more \"accurate\" measurements to our users\". Ya know?\n\n**Also, there might be a light at the end of the tunnel: Borrowing fees for AMC went up by 1% (currently sitting at 4.47% from the previous 3.5%. Usually an increase means that more people are borrowing shares to short.**\n\n**Edit X2:** A fellow ape showed me that someone else over at the r/RubinoffButtChug69 made a similar speculation.\n\nHis post ([link](https://www.reddit.com/user/RubinoffButtChug69/comments/lfdcv1/fintel_changed_their_short_volume_data_after_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)) also points out that **Apple's stock has not been effected by any of this.**\n\nAnd for all of you **asking about GME - the same post points out that GME also suffered from this. It's short volume got lowered by 50%.**\n\n**\\*\\*\\*UPDATE\\*\\*\\***\n\nThis beautiful ape tweeted at Fintel referencing this post\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w4seq03r6cg61.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=24808432116a21e6764ac9d1508faab3e26cd2c3\n\nThis is their response:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ft0xrjbt6cg61.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=54c3cb8e783953cd2b62f069245e282e4efd86d5\n\nSo their excuse is a \"programming error\". Fine, let's say that that's true for the daily short volume, right? But for the historical values of past months compare to February?

{"title": "Using math, I came to the conclusion that APHA options is a better investment than TLRY options.", "selftext": "At the time of this post (Feb 10, 2021, post-8pm) APHA closed at $28.15 and TLRY closed at $67.80. With the upcoming merger (around May, right?) where APHA will be worth 0.83 for ever 1 TLRY share, that means, should both stocks trade sideways from now until the merger, APHA will be worth around ($67.80 x 0.83 = $56.27). So......if that's the case, that means if you buy the highest OTM APHA leaps ($35c, which is selling at $11.60 which is $1160/contract at the time of this post), and APHA/TLRY trades sideways until the merger happens, APHA will be worth $56.27, which means it will be over $20 ITM of the $35c strike price. And if you bought those APHA at $11.60, which means the break even is at $46.60, you will still be ~$10 ITM, which, for every one contract you buy, is $1000 gainz since the delta will be at 1.00.\n\nThis ALMOST seems like a sure thing. Why not a sure thing? Well, as the merger date gets closer and closer, there is a chance that TLRY will slowly start decreasing in price and/or APHA will start increasing in price to reach an equilibrium. Assuming a bearish stance, imagine APHA trades sideways the entire time and remains at $28.15 until the merger, and TLRY decreases in price to become the same price as APHA (ie: $28.15). which means APHA will be worth $28.15 x 0.83 = $23.36. Therefore, those $35 c strike price leaps will be OTM by ~$11. With the $35c strike price having a delta at .6868, that means a loss of 68.68 x $11 = $755.48 from your $1160 $35c leaps investment (it'll probably be more since I'm not taking gamma into consideration).\n\nIf you wanna be bearish and don't want to risk losing $755.48 out of your $1160 investment. for a $75.548 / $1160 = 65% loss on investment, then this post is not for you because you worry about the loss more than the reward (which should not be that case since we have no problems seeing GME shares waaaaay in the red while diamond handing those shares. ) Perhaps you should step away from weed-stops because there may be a chance the stocks for both TLRY/APHA crash like weed stocks crashed in 2018, which may leave your options expiring worthless.\n\nHowever, my thought process is that TLRY/APHA SHOULD not crash soon (not unless it rallies too high too quickly and people think those stock are in a bubble about to pop and wanna cash out their profits before they fell so they won't be left bagholding and start selling which'll cause the stocks to drop which will/may cause panic selling from newbies here in WSB wanting to cut their losses ) before the merger (ie: Democrats are in power and speculation is good that weed will become legalized, and thus, further rallying) which means buying APHA leaps may be a good choice.\n\nAm I mathing correctly?\n\nMy positions before I get banned.\n\nhttps://ibb.co/pngSqjy\n\nhttps://ibb.co/fpVczf1\n\nhttps://ibb.co/z5XcJ9r\n\nIf you click on my profile, you'll see that I bought 100 contracts of TLRY at 0.77 a month ago. I've since sold 75 contracts of them as the stock rallied so I could use the profits to buy leaps in other stocks and APHA. Man, had I held till now, I'd be able to sell those contracts for $346k. Oh well, gainz is gainz.\n\nHere's a screen capture of the APHA contract I yolo'd into using some of my TLRY profits.\n\nhttps://ibb.co/2MPH6bK\n\nLook at those dates. I bought APHA leaps options the day before this post, and the morning of this post. Anyway, who's ready to lose money yolo'ing into weed stocks like I did?\n\nTLDR: APHA seems like a good choice moreso than TLRY since those Dems are in power and there is good speculation play with the legalization of weed.", "id": "lhbbqj", "created_utc": 1613012439.0, "score": 844, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 323, "comments": [{"body": "> With the upcoming merger (around May, right?) where APHA will be worth 0.83 for ever 1 TLRY share\n\nI think you got that backwards, so all of your math was based on what looks like an incorrect assumption.\n\n\"Under the terms of the Arrangement, the shareholders of Aphria (the \"Aphria Shareholders\") will\nreceive 0.8381 shares (the \"Exchange Ratio\") of Tilray for each Aphria common share (each, an\n\"Aphria Share\").\"\n\nhttps://www.m-x.ca/f_circulaires_en/210-20_en.pdf\n\nThat's a prelim Canadian adjustment memo.

Anyway, here's my take on TLRY:\n\nWhy are the options on these weed tickers so expensive?  Because market makers have priced in the possibility of an explosive move in the near future.  This is reflected in implied volatilities exceeding 300%.  For reference, implied vol on AAPL is between 20-30%...even during earnings the share price of Apple doesn't bounce around too much.  Everybody knows it's a solid company with a reliably predictable amount of annual growth.  Market makers have no reason to expect a big surprise with Apple, and as a result the price tag for APPL options is relatively cheap.  In WSB parlance, they're cheap because it's unlikely that a YOLO play on AAPL calls will yield heaps of tendies.  More likely than not, you'll be holding FD's. \n\nEssentially, buying calls or puts reflects a conviction that the price movement will be larger than what the options market makers have baked into the price tag for the option.  In technical terms, going long an option (held through expiration, not scalping intra-day price changes) is only profitable if realized volatility exceeds implied volatility.  Historically, options are overpriced -- implied volatility is larger than realized volatility.  Retail traders can exploit this discrepancy by selling options instead of buying them.  If realized volatility is less than implied volatility (ie the price movement is less than what market makers have baked into the cake), the option expires worthless and the seller keeps the premium.   \n\nSo right now, options across the board for weed names are expensive.  How would retail traders potentially capture an edge?  One way is to sell out of the money puts.  20 - 40 delta depending on your risk tolerance.  I sold TLRY $40 strike puts with Feb 19 expiration for $500 and the same strike for the March 19 expiration for $1100.  My worst case scenario for the Feb 19 puts is that the price drops below $35 and I get assigned shares.  Which I'm ok with -- even at a loss -- because I believe the price will recover in time and I'm willing to bag hold.  For the March 19 expiration, I'm ok as long as the price of TLRY trades above $29.  If the share price trades above those values, I make money.  If they trade at or above $40, I keep all of the premium at expiration.  You could trade the higher strikes for even more premium...but the risk is higher.\n\nNow, if the price of TLRY blows sky high, I can close out my puts since the price of the puts will drop since they become even more out of the money.  I may be even so inclined to roll the puts to higher strikes to collect more premium.  \n\nIn the event that the price falls, say to around $45-50 range, I believe I can still collect a good percentage of the total premium even way ahead of expiration due volatility crush.  If the hype is over and the price of TLRY stabilizes, the implied volatility of the options will plummet, probably below 150%.  When that happens, the options become much cheaper.  If I want, I can close out my position and collect a portion of the premium --  I'd still be leaving some money on the table because I'm closing prior to expiration (I won't get all of the $500 or $1100), but I'll bank a decent chunk of it and eliminate assignment risk in the process.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for the explanation, I really think thetagang is the way to go, I just need to dial in my strategy based on risk tolerance and start cashing in instead of trying to time buying calls and hoping that I‚Äôm on the right side of the IV.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5689473152160645}], "tickers": ["aapl", "aapl"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.11390668898820877}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5421667695045471}, {"body": "and APHA just wiped 50% of my profit when the market opened.", "score": 5, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4370048940181732}, {"body": "Redo the math after today lol what is it at now", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "I think 0?

While I like $SPCE, I have a few questions.\n\n- Why do you predict $SPCE will acquire Boom? Boom is in a fantastic position and yes, while a lot of the components of the XB-1 are built by Branson/Rutan's company, the Boom guys don't need a buyout. They have their own funding and they have plenty of ties to Lockheed and the Skunk Works on their board. I think it's far more likely you'll see them slowly gobbled up by lockmart. Yes, they're collaborating with Virgin on the Airliner but believe me, commercial applications for quiet boom tech pales in comparison to the defence sector. Not like Lockmart can't throw more money at the problem than Virgin can.\n\n-Regarding Space launch, what about LauncherOne makes it succeed where Pegasus failed? Is there a large enough market for 10 cube sats at a time? They currently have a single White Knight Two, which they aren't using to launch LauncherOne. StratoLaunch is a competitor that has the Roc, it's got a MUCH larger payload capacity than SS2 and Cosmic Girl, but the market isn't there for them, why is it there for $SPCE?

(I'm ignoring the very high latitude polar regions for now - very low population and Starlink will cover them anyway.)\n\nIt's much, much cheaper to expand Starlink than to expand existing intercontinental fiber networks.\n\nFor this reason it's also much faster to expand.\n----\n\n**2)** Starlink is the ideal mobile network data carrier.\n\nStarlink enables 'self-contained' cellular mobile network macro and micro-cells. The ~5 msecs short distance latency is still perfect for voice or data networks.\n\nIndividual cells on the ground can be installed in low cost areas, and they don't require a connection to existing fiber networks. They don't even require an electricity source in more remote locations, if backed by solar power and overnight battery backup.\n----\n\n**3)** Starlink allows the breaking of urban Internet monopolies. (!)\n\nWith cable Internet being a monopoly in most of the US, they are ripe for disruption even in urban centers.\n\nIf Starlink is able to allocate its own frequency spectrum, and can be used to create urban mobile cells, then they can offer broadband internet to customers even without a Starlink receiver. The 'last mile' monopoly can be broken via mobile networks.\n\nThis can scale Internet services to arbitrary densely populated urban centers as well.\n\nI expect Starlink's frequencies to be a big fight for this reason ...\n\n----\n\n**4)** Starlink access increases the value of non-urban real-estate.\n\nWith Covid removing the corporate reluctance from work-from-home approaches, and moving more of the entertainment industry (movies, etc.) online, the physical location of about ~50% of the workforce in modern economies can be anywhere in the country or even on the globe.

A small but wealthy minority might prefer to move to scenic locations, if broadband Internet connection is given.\n\n----\n\n**TL;DR:** The quadruple forces of superior scaling & coverage costs, the ability to compete with terrestrial Internet services even in urban centers, and the economic value-add of democratizing Internet access to remote locations will be a powerful force IMO.\n\nThe end state will be that IMO a couple of space Internet constellations will cover all communications requirements of Earth, and terrestrial fiber becomes an obsolete hindrance to a legacy network that new construction projects will skip.\n\nThat's a couple of decades out still.\n\nAnyway, many of these economic forces are short-term in nature, and thus the Starlink IPO will be a very nice opportunity for long-term investors to enter into this disruption process. ü§†", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.029199371114373207}, {"body": "Haha, you triggered a favorite topic of mine - Starlink constellation physics & economics, and I had some time to spend on this as well. ü§†\n\nHere's my abbreviated Starlink thesis (split into multiple comments):\n\n#**Starlink Internet advantages, physics:**\n\n**1)** Starlink has a fundamental long distance latency advantage:\n\n- Speed of light in the overwhelming majority of fiber is 70% - it's 100% in space. So even in a straight line Starlink has an advantage.\n- But fiber is rarely laid in a straight line. \n- Fiber loss requires periodic repeater-amplifiers which add to optical latency. Starlink line of sight laser cross-links.\n- Fiber can in principle hug the curvature of the planet closer and create shorter connections - in practice fiber links are much longer.\n\nTo give a practical example that should be beneficial to fiber networks: the New York to Frankfurt Internet connection is almost straight line, on the bottom of the Atlantic.\n\nYet actual practical ping round-trip times are ~88 msec:\n\n> https://wondernetwork.com/pings/New%20York/Frankfurt\n\nWith Starlink, if we assume the long-term ~350 km altitude of their orbits and a reasonably dense network of 10,000+ satellites, then the estimated line of sight Starlink distance between New York and London is:\n\n    (350 km + 6,440 km + 350 km + 50 km) √ó 2 = 14,380 km\n\nThat's with 5 hops and a ~50 km positioning fuzz, because the constellation won't be 100% dense.\n\nIf we estimate low-latency equipment of <10Œºs at each hop, and a speed of light of 299,792 km/sec, then we get a photon propagation Starlink round-trip latency of:\n\n    14,380 km √∑ 299,792 km/s  = 47.96 msec\n\nIf we add in the 5 hops of 0.01 msecs each, we get to around 48 msecs latency - almost twice as fast as a fiber optical connection of 88 msecs.\n\nBut New York and Frankfurt are two financial centers, where 90% of the distance can be crossed on fiber optical cables laid in an almost straight line at the bottom of the Atlantic, i.e. they are connected via almost line of sight fiber connections.\n\nLet's take two less optimally connected first-world capitals, say Helsinki to Taipei:\n\n> https://wondernetwork.com/pings/Helsinki/Taipei\n\n373 msec best-case ping latency.\n\nWith Starlink (I'll spare you the calculation details), it's 58 msecs (!) - more than 6x faster.\n\nThere are even less optimally connected capitals - say Buenos Aires to Shenzen, or Wellington (NZ) to Mumbai - both above 500 msecs today.\n\nSo for long-distance Internet backbone connections - **even if you live within an urban center**, Starlink is the superior solution.\n\nThe break-even point between Starlink and terrestrial fiber connections is somewhere around ~700 km distance.\n\n----\n\n**2)** Data Center distance advantage:\n\nMost Internet users interact with some sort of datacenter - Google servers, YouTube or Netflix, placed near population centers.\n\nIf we check the density of say Google's data centers, we get such a map:\n\n> https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/locations/\n\n90% of the world population is actually outside the 700 km circle of all Google data centers - **even if they live in urban centers**.\n\n----\n\n**3)** Data center location advantage:\n\nThis is a longer-term advantage, but if you think it through then it will make sense for SpaceX to put data centers into space:\n\n- infinite energy source (solar),\n- no weather impact,\n- perfect global distribution of resources by way of orbital mechanics.\n\nIn this case the break-even distance circle to the nearest data center is reduced to around ~350 km. Even fewer people live within 350 km of the Internet data centers they are using, especially if we factor in fiber network layout inefficiencies.\n\n----\n\n**TL;DR**: on the physics side, Starlink is essentially unbeatable in terms of offering low latency global Internet infrastructure. All large carriers will be using it, and I believe developing countries will prefer to connect to Starlink, not just because it's much, less expensive, but also because it gives them a superior connection on equal terms with everyone else - the \"democracy of orbital mechanics\".\n\nIt will be **fiber** that will be a niche in the long run: for short distance communication between specialist projects that need to be connected via a public fiber network.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["nflx"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.09887488186359406}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2509697675704956}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.01937023177742958}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5730908513069153}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4942433834075928}, {"body": "Talking about the guy who predicted the banks to fail and the fall of the housing market in 08", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "And the gamestop squeeze iirc", "score": 7, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.024207964539527893}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.23124049603939056}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.44679200649261475}, {"body": "Before or after the split lol", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.141846165060997}], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "I feel like most people on these subs seem to think it'll go up forever. -\\_- I definitely think it's okay to stay in your position if you got in early but I wouldn't enter into one now.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "That's an executive summary of the last 10 years of the AAPL and AMZN bear theses: \"overvalued\", while not properly estimating growth potential.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "In 2010 AAPL had a pe ratio of 17, tesla has one of over 1000, dont even try to compare these two.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "> In 2010 AAPL had a pe ratio of 17, tesla has one of over 1000, dont even try to compare these two.\n\n**1)** Just to demonstrate how silly your P/E valuation argument is: early 2016 Amazon GAAP P/E ratio was **482** and it was trading at $550.

For now they're currently impossible with today's battery technology (the batteries are just too heavy and don't have enough juice), but that doesn't mean that new technology & improvements to existing technology won't make it viable overtime.\n\nThere's a practical limit to how much thrust you can make with a propeller/ducted fan. If the propeller spins too fast the tips will go supersonic and the shockwaves will put a lot of strain on the propellers. Electric GA aircraft are feasible if we find something significantly better than lithium-ion, but large aircraft won't move past combustion engines in our lifetime.\n\nAdoption of electric GA aircraft will also be much slower than cars. First of all, the pace of technology in aviation is significantly slower. The C172 was first made in the 50s and are still being made today. I've flown C172s built anywhere from the 60s to the early 2000s and they're about the same. Certifying an aircraft with the FAA takes years and costs insane amounts of money, so we're still flying the same aircraft our grandparents learned to fly in. \n\nIn addition to this, the incentive to move to electric planes isn't as strong. Electric cars can make up for the lower energy density of batteries compared to gasoline with regenerative braking. Planes use drag to bleed off kinetic energy, so the amount of energy that can be recovered is much lower. At oshkosh 2019 I talked with the representative of a company that converts aircraft to electric. They had the ability to recapture some power from the windmilling propeller, but I asked them how much energy they could recover, and they said 'not much at all, but the propeller is going to windmill, and the energy is there'. They seemed like they had a strong vision but they had a lot of practical and legal issues to sort out.

{"title": "Exposing Sundial growers, ticker SNDL", "selftext": "UPDATE Feb 23, 2021: **I told you it would drop,** but I'm still going to spend a lot of time reading their next financial reports, because all this news about how much money they have is absurd. I'm skeptical, but even if it's true, being cash heavy isn't always a good thing.\n\nAn example of a good cash heavy company is Southwest, LUV. Why? Because they've proven to have a good business model. Nobody hates Southwest, and even their competitors fear them. They have a position of security that none of their competition has. It will drop, but that's gonna be my sign to buy more. With Sundial? They are cash heavy is a commodities business that has revenue which has been dropping YoY, QoQ, DoD, etc. Their cash is not from any profits, but from speculation of profits.\n\n**Thus, I expect it to keep dropping in price, and I expect them to put up another bad quarter.** If that's not the case, I'll gladly eat my own words.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease put up with my smooth brain analysis, here. Like many of you, I consider myself a connoisseur and producer of modern aut. I am autist in my own right, and as such I have spent hours looking over the shady financial reporting of this shady company.\n\nOf course, I am in no way certified to give financial advice to anyone. I am simply concerned that this company, if it is really fraudulent, is going to destroy investor's savings, and I think it's only fair that I express these concerns.\n\nI'll try to keep this concise, and not miss any details, because there is a lot going on here, and it really does get complicated.\n\nFair warning, my decision has been to invest in some put options on February 11th before the price started dropping, and it's up to you whether you want to as well. I give no advice on such an investment, but I personally think I made the best choice, and I know for a fact that their financials do not add up, so this is more to call attention to anyone who might be convinced to invest just how bad of a decision that would be...\n\nHere are some reasons:\n\n**A. OBVIOUS SHILLS**\n\nI won't name names, but obvious shills like [u/Masternewworldorder](https://www.reddit.com/u/Masternewworldorder/) have been trying to pump up the stock price through a social media campaign and ride the coattails of the GME debacle. I would not just simply post this guy's name on here if I had any other way to show how all 18 posts on his account are about hyping Sundial using the GME fiasco as a model for doing so. He even mentions GME, calling SNDL the \"next\" SNDL. To you, buddy, if you're doing what everybody knows you're doing, and the SEC finds out, you and those you work for or with will probably be arrested. Not only that, but his page clearly breaks a few rules on the sub. Pump & Dump most likely, advertisement, market manipulation, etc.\n\nIf you're just riding the hype wagon, you should really choose another company to hype up. If I'm correct in my math, they don't have the funds to operate through the quarter, nor can they get a loan to continue operations. I'll discuss their lies about their debt at the bottom of the page. I'll just say for now, it's my belief that they are either doing a pump and dump, or using share capital to have enough cash that they can file for bankruptcy and walk away with cash and hand.\n\n**B. DISGRACEFUL FINANCIALS**\n\nFinancial reports must comply with a ton of SEC and FTC laws about documents that they have to file. This is to protect those who would wish to invest their money so as to be protected from the sort of activities that would destroy them, and any trust in the stock market that they had. Maybe I'm cynical, but that last part is the most important. SEC wants trust, because then they have a functional system.\n\nA company that is traded on an American stock exchange must fulfill certain requirements regarding their financial reports, that usually allow for an exception in the case of international filers, but Canada is very similar in this regard, though perhaps notable from this stock, that's not the case at all \\[1\\]\n\n1. Their most up to date report shows **$500 million** in share capital with **$70 million equity.** (I believe that's Canadian $)\n2. leveraged against the share capital is a **$500 million** accumulated deficit, up **$140 million** from the year before. Coincidentally, their **debt** obligations are **down $140 million** from the year before as well. This suggests they are using issued stock and general market manipulations to pay off their debt. They say that the issuance of more stock is for a few things, depending on which report you read. I can't find them all, but trust me, [https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&CIK=0001766600&type=&dateb=&owner=include&start=0&count=40](https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&CIK=0001766600&type=&dateb=&owner=include&start=0&count=40), it's in here somewhere. They say it's for purchasing of new properties, or maybe operation activities, but they never clearly state that they are paying off their debt with the new stock. I don't know if that's illegal or not, but it's definitely untrustworthy.\n3. For the 9 month period from January 1st, 2020 to September 30th 2020, they had **$12 million in revenue**, which cost them **$10 million to sell**, but they also lost **\\~ $20 million to inventory obsolescence**, and **$60 million to asset impairment**. As an investor, I would like to know why that happened, but their reporting makes absolutely no mention of it in their section **Risk Factors** on all **F-3** filings \\[2\\]. They may not have to include that, but again, you should really be given the opportunity to find out, and any company acting with the foresight to know stockholder trust is important - any company who wants to succeed - will make these things abundantly clear.\n\n**C. LETTER FROM THE AUDITOR**\n\nThis is the icing on the cake, and which verifies to me that there is so much more going on here than I could even understand. The auditor is paid by the company to look at their financials thoroughly to see if the condensed info meets standards, and fairly describes the company's information to the potential stockholders.\n\nThis auditor has time and again given them the same letter more or less, stating that their financials show that **the company has been acting in breach of their debt covenant**, which is the most evidence of a serious issue here. They also say that various other issues in Sundial's reporting gives them concern that **the company should not, and probably will not be able to continue operating** the way that they are \\[3\\]. This is all I need to know, really. And why any speculative raise in their market capitalization on the stock market gives me serious concern about the current state of our economic system. It's examples like these which destroy investor confidence, and lead to seriously tough times. Shorting this position is **not just profitable**, it's necessary to **save the soundness of our economy**, in my opinion.\n\n**D. SUSPICIOUS REASONS FOR FULFILLMENT OF DEBTS**\n\nIf securities on an exchange are linked to the equity of a firm that goes bankrupt and cannot operate, then all that money goes out of investors hands, and into the hands of debtors, or is liquidated and given to the preferred stock holders.\n\nLuckily for the executives and majority shareholders of Sundial Growers, Inc, they have a tiny little clause hidden in one of their reports which says that all liquidated funds must first be given to preferred stock holders before any is given to issued common stock traded on any exchange \\[4\\].\n\nThis is important, because they have clearly stated that **they can issue indefinite numbers of preferred and common stock**, and that **preferred stock gets first right** in the case of liquidation. Essentially, they can use the extra stock issuance to dilute costs and trick investors into thinking **EPS** is getting closer to that **above 0** marker (total earnings continues to drop further every statement), while also separately securing any cash left by issuing more preferred stock to themselves upon liquidation so that you, the investor, **get absolutely nothing** while they get any proceeds from going bankruptcy, possibly even millions.\n\n**E. WHAT IS THE NAME OF THE COMPANY EVEN**\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1766600/000110465920114508/a20-32923\\_1sc13g.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1766600/000110465920114508/a20-32923_1sc13g.htm)\n\nSome guy named **Ryan Dunfield**, who is mentioned nowhere else in their financials, received 25,000,000 shares in preferred stock for absolutely zero dollars in cost to him, well, actually, it's that Ryan Dunfield gets **25 million share**s,\\[redacted company name\\]**,**\\[redacted company name\\]**, and 1920576 ALBERTA LTD** all get shares as well. However, these are 3 companies of which **Ryan Dunfield is the president and/or CEO**. Ryan Dunfield got **1/10 of all stocks** available, not to mention voting power from these stocks, without paying any money for them, This was filed very recently too, It was filed after the last known financial report on September 30th. I haven't calculated all of the other people's issuance of preferred stock either, but this is definitely suspect to me. These sorts of dealings are **being done all the time by this company**, but they drown out the sec filings by naming **every single filing under the exact same document name**, so it's damn near impossible to keep track of any of it.\n\n**F. NUMBERS DONT ADD UP**\n\nIt's also convenient that they just issued common stock to fill the company with cash, and actually **did away with all of their debt.** If that is to be believed (sorry, I can't find any proof in their filings), then they are a rarity among companies to have done so **and maintained a $600 million cash reserve**. Not to mention that the **$500 million accumulated deficit**, **the $100 million total debt** and **accounts payable**, along with a **$90 million operating loss** all is somehow accounted for by **$18 million in financing income** (stock issuance I presume) before September 30th of last year, and supposedly **$100 million in stock issuance** if you read any related news, and less than **$200 million in illiquid assets**. Honestly, I don't know how these numbers can turn **$20 million cash into $600 million cash in 3 months**.\n\nHowever they managed to pull that off this year, I'm pretty sure that they will continue to leverage this as a deficit against their Share capital. If that's the case, they now have **$600 million share capita**l with **$690 million in deficit** leveraged against that.\n\nI'm not sure if anyone is aware of this, but if you owe a bank money, you can't simply say \"Sorry, this isn't actually a debt, it's a deficit\". It doesn't work that way, and **reporting it that way is serious fraud**. They may not actually be prosecuted for this fraud, but it still exists, and it is damaging to those who would invest in it.\n\n**G. SHOW THE INSTITUTIONS AND THE SEC WE CAN HANDLE OURSELVES**\n\nThe institutions have not invested anything in this company, and I suspect it has everything to do with their financials. I bet you if a company with a large amount of institutional ownership operated the way this company does, then the SEC would be their to protect the institutions so fast.\n\nInstead, it's left up to the little guys, who don't have enough money to pay Treasurers from the shady San Francisco political bubble $800k in speaking fees, to fend for themselves. We all take the most risk in the market because we're targeted by scammers, immeasurably larger competition, and indifferent regulators. In my opinion, this **short position against Sundial would be exactly what we need to show regulators what it's like to do their job.**\n\nBy the way, I'm pretty suspicious about the timing of this sudden increase in cash, given that I'm pretty sure tax season, and financial reporting season are very soon.

What I'd like to know is why they would not market the deal they made with Ryan Dunfield? \n\nI don't know who that is, so he could be fully above board, but during this quarter, SEC filings show they definitely have made a deal with him where he received 10% of all common stock available and received voting rights. He can't be too happy about the shelf offer. \n\nCommon stock which, by the way, was offered at no par value. Or was it $.83 per share? I can't remember which was the official one. They were both on the same document, but the no par value was on the official document filed with the SEC. Of course, you could ask me to find it, and I'd be at a loss, because every single one of the 100s of documents, each with 5 or so documents attached, is called a 6K - a general filing from an international company.\n\nYou know you for a fact, if you've ever seen an SEC filing, that all the best companies are loaded up to their tits in debt anyways. If a company is debt averse, or maybe unable to actually receive a line of credit, it's a really bad sign.\n\nBy the way, and I said this in my DD, check the letter from the auditor. First off, they've got him written in there as an \"expert opinion\". They had to file correspondence with the SEC showing they asked him if that was okay. They knew very well that his opinion would keep serious investors away for a good reason. Let's just say Warren Buffett certainly is not investing in this company, and I'm even thinking it's probably got more to do with pushing illegal marijuana sales into America and abroad with their special \"unaudited\" balance sheet.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I'm really not seeing anything too suspicious in the reports.  The Ryan Dunfield is kind of weird but thats about it.  Looks like he is a hedge fund CEO in Alberta.  Did you miss that Sundial is a 50% owner of PathwayRx who just got a 1.1B (with another company) govt grant?\n\nWhen I say I don't see anything suspicious keep in mind I am speaking in context to the cannabis sector.  I think you are trying to apply your DD to the market as a whole.  That is ineffective and useless IMO.  You can't compare a cannabis company to Microsoft and say the former looks suspicious.  All cannabis companies are pretty sketch under the hood.\n\nHere is the big one you are not taking into consideration....\n\nDuring the time frame of all the filings you are reviewing, Sundial was positioned to provide inhalable products DURING A GLOBAL PANDEMIC OF A RESPIRATORY DISEASE.  Of course they took a major hit.  Every single company in the sector did.  Sundial is pivoting towards non-inhalable means of consumption because that's what the market wants.  It will take time to recover most likely.  DO NOT DISCOUNT COVIDS AFFECTS ON THE SECTOR.\n\nWith that being said, of course a cannabis company is going to be more risk that a Microsoft or Apple.  We all know that right?  Cool.  Carry on.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "I'm not trying to apply to whole sector at all, I think that would be bad to do.

In which case, it can't be too hard to see why someone would be suspicious of their financial dealings, and how they decide to make money.\n\nAnyways, did you see the historical volume in call options expiring on Feb 19th? It spikes on January 28th, a day before the they announced a new stock offering. It's not even about success at this point, there is serious evidence of an artificial gamma squeeze.\n\nWhat I'm saying is that SNDL's price was modeled after what happened with GME.

Accumulated deficit - this is simply it's carried forward losses since inception. There's nothing untoward about it. Read the cash flow statement and accompanying notes. Not all the debt was paid by way of share issue, $45m was through the assignment of debt to Bridge Farm on sale of it's investment. \n\nThe prospectus definitely talks about the company's indebtedness and one of it's stated use of funds is to reduce it through the issue of shares. There's nothing illegal about this. \n\nB3. i) Revenues to Sept 2020 - you're looking at the wrong column. \n\nii) Inventory obsolescence - this is in the notes, it is only a provision and very likely related to the fact cannabis has a shelf life. They are provisioning it for what they could sell it for.\n\niii) Asset impairment - again, it's in the notes. It relates to an internal assessment of on of its cash generating units. Their calculations are based on estimated future cash flows and a subjective discount rate, they believe the book value is more than what could be recovered if the asset was sold at 30 September 2020. However, the method they used was value in use, which is pretty subjective as one of the inputs is a discount rate. Pick and choose the discount and the impairment would be +- $10m at each 1% interval\n\nC. Audit report - yes, the going concern assumption has been addressed in almost every one of their reports. The debt covenant they breached was that their earnings couldn't cover interest expense at a level set by the credit providers. However, they've raised plenty of cash following prospectus, the debt problem is essentially no longer an issue. I'm sure the audit opinion for the financial reports at 31 December 2020 will be miles different.\n\nF. Cash balances - there is nothing about this point that makes any sense. Neither one of the things pointed out have anything to do with each other. The only comment i'll make here is that the total raised in the last 6 months, together with restructuring of some of it's businesses and cash receipts from their own debtors, was able to repay debts, cover operating losses etc.\n\nG. Preferred stock - this is common, and not an issue, they aren't trying to hide anything. Preferred stock also receive dividends ahead of commons. But the downside is they usually don't have voting rights as is the case with SNDL. They may rank ahead of commons in liquidation but they rank behind other creditors, so if the company goes down the toilet, they'll likely be in the same boat with the commons.\n\nI'm in under $1 so the volatility above $2 isn't an issue for me.

Huge stock offerings leading up to times of massive liquidity injections and the suspicious and absurd options plays right before the company releases some news leads me to believe this could very well have been the company shorting its own stock by selling overly priced and wildly out of the money options leading up to the shelf offering in February.\n\nThe second thing is, do they even have the potential to raise very much in price anymore?

{"title": "Thetagang Does NOT Mean You Aren't Taking a Massive Risk", "selftext": "I see a lot of new posters here talking about how they are a former WSB user, lost a lot of money, but now have outsized gains \"due to Thetagang.\" They then proceed to show CSP or even Credit Spread positions on tickers like AMC, TSLA, RIOT, PLTR, TLRY, etc. These users are still taking on massive risk. Let me explain.\n\nThe standard thetagang strategy is selling out-of-the-money puts on a ticker the user would not mind owning. By definition, these puts are less than 50 Delta meaning as the stock increases the strategy will profit at a rate of <50% of the underlying movement (this decreases as the stock goes up more). However, you still have all the downside of the stock. This means if we get an extended downturn or even a prolonged pullback, you are open to all the downside of these uber-growth stocks that **historically perform the worst in the bear market**. \n\nThetagang tends to reduce volatility on a given underlying at the expense of some returns. However, if you are targeting at +200% IV underlying, you should still expect a very high portfolio volatility. That works great when we have the longest raging bull market in history. However, if this thing turns down, you are going to be stuck holding WSB style loses with no ability to sell calls anywhere near your cost basis.\n\nAll I'm saying is you need to pay attention to the underlying and understand how you would feel if the stock shit the bed. If you don't have a plan for your meme stock dropping by +50% over the next year, you probably should reconsider your strategy.\n\nI personally have allocations to CSPs on GME. However, these are:\n\n1. Way OTM\n2. A small percentage of my portfolio\n3. A stock I would not mind owning if it cratered to $20, $10 or even $5 over the next 2-4 weeks.\n\nAgain, I'm not saying don't do these strategies. I'm just saying please be aware you can still have WSB style loses with thetagang.", "id": "lj1oht", "created_utc": 1613227165.0, "score": 808, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 335, "comments": [{"body": "Lol this was made for the fellow who was bragging about selling GME 60p 2/5.

The 28 strike is trading (as of this writing) at -0.2953 delta, with a premium of 3.05 (last traded), so we choose that as our target. We can sell four contracts at this strike, given our decision to commit to $11,200 (4 \\* 100 \\* 28  = 11,200). We collect a premium of $1,220. Our buying power is reduced to $8,800. We have a \\~10:1 risk/reward ratio (because we need to be prepared to lose 100% if PLTR drops to zero and we get assigned).\n\nNow lets try it with PCS. We look at the spreads and decide to backstop our 28 sale with a 26 buy. A single contract spread is selling for $0.93 (midpoint of 0.77 and 1.09 as of this writing). Since we have 11,200 to play with, we can sell 104x 26/28 Mar21 PCS for a net credit of $9,672 with a max exposure of 11,128. Our risk/reward ratio is 1.15:1. Our buying power is reduced to $8,872.\n\nBoth scenarios have about \\~62% chance of max profit, and both break even around the $27-ish mark. The PCS scenario obviously produces more potential profit.\n\nBut there are additional benefits to PCS. First, lets assume we want both PCS and CSP to provide the same amount of premium. We'll limit the PCS play to $1,220 premium collected. This means that we'll be able to sell 13 26/28 Mar21 PCS for $1,209, with a max exposure of $1,391 and the same 1.15:1 risk/reward ratio. Additionally, we incur a hit to BP of only that $1,391, which means we still have $18,609 in BP remaining after the trade.\n\nWhy is this important? It means we can put 7or 8 similarly-sized plays in action for the same $11,200 we intended to commit at the outset. The intelligent choice would be to put in motion plays across widely-diverse segments of the economy. While the benefits of diversity should be obvious, I'll explain it anyway -- it means that for the CSP, I have to be right 100% of the time to make money. Who is right 100% of the time? For the PCS, with 7 plays in motion at once, I only have to be right 57% of the time. Given that the probability of any profit with the PCS as described above are 67% (taking this from the Power eTrade screen, btw), the odds are in my favor that no matter what PLTR does, I am not likely to lose money over all of these plays.\n\nSo, you ask me, \"what would ScarletHark do?\" It should be obvious what I would do, and I turn the question around to you -- what would YOU do?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "So you prefer PCSs to CSPs?

If the underlying is at or below the strike price at expiry, the contract is exercised and you are now the proud new owner of 100 shares of XYZ, at the strike price.

At first, it made no sense to me, because it seems so clearly irrational to assume you can perfectly time the market despite every piece of evidence - and just logic - telling you that you almost certainly cannot do so over any significant time interval. \n\nHowever, I will say that it's exciting to buy and sell often, especially in this bull market. It feels like you're ***making*** money in a way that unrealized gains sometimes can't/don't, just because the latter is simply a number on your screen with uncertainty, while the former involves taking a real profit. It also feels like you're doing something smart when you profit off of things in the short-term. So - it is obviously irrational, and I'm still surprised most retail investors on here don't care to acknowledge these facts, but the psychological explanation for why this happens is at least rather clear.\n\nBut as someone who also enjoys that level of engagement and excitement, here's what I would do to keep things fun and interesting without fooling myself into thinking I can time the market: keep at least 80% of my money in long-term holdings (not necessarily safe ones - I admittedly take an aggressive approach with growth stocks after careful DD involving lots of sell-side research reports and my own analysis), while using the other 20% for options. Now, on its face, this seems absurd - why would the person advocating for long-term, safe investing advocate for 20% in options? Because LEAPs, 6+ month ITM or ATM calls, and even selling OTM puts allows you to increase your possible returns using less capital up-front. Obviously, the trade-off is more risk, but I personally love this strategy.\n\nSay I have $10,000 to invest. If I put all of that money into 10 different stocks, then besides perhaps my paychecks, I'm not going to have any fun, nor will I be able to chase any new ideas, unless I want to be the (wrong) retail trader who just buys and sells every time a new idea comes around, losing out on the power of the market by trying to time it over and over. If you keep $2,000 for options, while keeping the $8,000 invested, you can buy ITM calls that, roughly, allow you to achieve 80-90% of the same gains as the underlying equity with only 40-50% of the capital invested. LEAPs are even better for this, because with OTM LEAPs, although your risk is far higher, the amount of capital you need to put in is extremely low compared to the reward. Basically, instead of essentially playing with large portions of your account by convincing yourself it's a good idea to trade often, just acknowledge that as a casual retail investor, you likely will lose more money the more often you trade, and keep the vast majority of your money invested for the long-term, barring any changes in the company or ETF that you are uncomfortable with. But with the 10-20%, knock yourself out with options, but not options that'll \"get you rich quick\" like on /r/wallstreetbets \\- instead, with options like LEAPs, especially deep ITM calls, where your time horizon is still long-term enough that you're not just gambling (multiple months out, ideally 6+ months from expiration) but the inherent risk allows you to control more of the underlying equity than you would be able to otherwise, allowing you to invest in comparably more companies or ideas because you need less capital in order to do so.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5561725497245789}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.551677405834198}, {"body": "Just because it‚Äôs difficult to do doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not a viable solution.

{"title": "Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning February 22nd, 2021", "selftext": "Good Sunday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning February 22nd, 2021.\n\n# **Stronger economic data could power stocks that thrive in a rebound in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/19/stronger-economic-data-could-power-stocks-that-thrive-in-a-rebound-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n> A decline in new Covid infections, along with improving economic data and stimulus hopes, could boost stocks that flourish in a resurging economy in the week ahead.\n*****\n> In the past week, expectations for a strong economic rebound helped boost interest rates.\n*****\n> While the broader stock market was choppy, sectors that do well in a rebound ‚Äì financials, airlines and industrials ‚Äì stood out as leaders. This is known as the reflation trade.\n*****\n> Those stocks gained at the expense of growth and technology, down 2%. Strategists expect that reflation trade to continue as signs suggest that the economy could make a sharp comeback.\n*****\n> The S&P 500 was down 0.7% on the week to 3,906, while the Dow was up a tiny 0.1% at 31,494. The Nasdaq was off 1.57% for the week, to 13,874, with the decline in tech. Apple, for instance, gave up 4% on the week.\n*****\n> The big event in the week ahead is testimony from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who delivers his semi-annual testimony on the economy before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday and the House Financial Services Committee Wednesday.\n*****\n> He is expected to discuss the increase in interest rates, as well as concerns that inflation could begin to take off.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs going to have to acknowledge that the data is improving and the virus situation is improving quite materially,‚Äù said Mark Cabana, head of U.S. rates strategy at Bank of America. ‚ÄúIt is going to be hard for him to sound as dovish as he has been.‚Äù\n*****\n> But Powell is expected to continue to emphasize that the Fed will keep rates low for a long time and maintain its easy policies to help the economy.\n*****\n> # Improving forecasts\n> Economists this past week ratcheted up tracking forecasts for first quarter gross domestic product, fueled in part by an unexpectedly sharp jump of 5.3% in January retail sales.\n*****\n> Goldman upped first-quarter growth to 6%, and Morgan Stanley said it was tracking at 7.5% for the first quarter. Economists linked the surprise gain in retail sales to stimulus checks sent to individuals under the last $900 billion stimulus program approved by Congress in late December.\n*****\n> The Biden administration has proposed another $1.9 trillion Covid relief package. That could come before the House of Representatives in the coming week.\n*****\n> ‚Ä≥[Powell‚Äôs] going to stick to the script. The script is lawmakers need to continue to provide support for the economy. He‚Äôs going to be supportive of the administration‚Äôs effort to get a big package through,‚Äù said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody‚Äôs Analytics.\n*****\n> # Key data during the week\n> Earnings continue to be important. There are more than 60 companies reporting, including Home Depot, Macy‚Äôs and TJX.\n*****\n> Key economic reports dropping next week include durable goods on Thursday, along with personal income and spending data on Friday\n*****\n> The Friday report includes the personal consumption expenditure price index, which the Fed monitors. The market is on the lookout for signs of rising inflation.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúI think the boom is going to start sooner than most people think,‚Äù said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA.\n*****\n> He said the stronger economy is helping drive Treasury yields higher, with the 10-year hitting a one-year high of 1.36% on Friday. Keon said the vaccine rollout is helping the outlook, as is the slowing spread of the virus.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúI think people were expecting a second-half boom, but I think the second quarter is going to be very strong, as people change their behavior,‚Äù he said.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúThe caution when it comes to savings and not going out, that‚Äôs going to go away sooner than we think,‚Äù Keon said. ‚ÄúRight now, you might see a 10% GDP number in the second or third quarter. That‚Äôs also due to the fact we‚Äôre likely to get a big stimulus package.‚Äù\n*****\n> He said investors are underestimating the surge in economic activity that should start in March and pick up steam in the second and third quarter as more people resume dining out and other activities.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúI think the world is going to look very different than it has over the past 12 months. We‚Äôre still bullish. We‚Äôre still overweight stocks,‚Äù Keon said.\n*****\n> He said a flood of money could hit the economy.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúThe size of the U.S. economy last year was about $21 trillion,‚Äù Keon added. ‚ÄúHouseholds now have excess savings of about $1.5 trillion and the stimulus package probably will be in the vicinity of $1.2, $1.6 trillion.‚Äù\n*****\n> He said the service sector should start to see a benefit that has been lifting the goods making side of the economy. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to see an incredible boom.‚Äù\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/KHikwKA.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/qGZEgZB.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/E5ZhAnt.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/TIhMYEf.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Y65lpFs.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/EY3NC9X.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/wmMRYoi.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/VasEMj8.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/uT5kxuP.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/uOalt0h.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/SMspx2i.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/RP7xVdo.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Value Outperforming Growth But Only for Large Caps\n\n> While the S&P 500 traded lower today, value stocks had a strong finish to the week. Starting with a look at dividend stocks, the iShares Select Dividend ETF (DVY) rose 1.35% today for its best day since January 6th when DVY rose nearly 4%. As shown below, DVY has recently been on a tear.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-DVY.png))**\n\n> Along with the dividend ETF (DVY), the iShares S&P 500 Value ETF (IVE) rose 0.31%, reaching a new 52-week high intraday. That compares to the growth counterpart, the iShares S&P 500 Growth ETF (IVW), which saw a bearish engulfing on its 0.65% decline. Today was the widest outperformance for value (IVE) over growth (IVW) since mid-January. As shown below, while both are still trending nicely higher long-term, the value ETF is at new highs while growth is closer to its 50-day moving average.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-SP.png))**\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-SP.png))**\n\n> Value's outperformance today only applied to large caps, though. While small caps have fallen over the past several sessions, the Russell 2000 Growth ETF (IWO) and Russell 2000 Value ETF (IWN) both rebounded nicely today with identical gains of 2.08%. In the case of small-cap growth (IWO), the recent declines have been more severe meaning today's strong performance still leaves it further below its highs than small-cap value (IWN).\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-R2K.png))**\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-R2K.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Industrial Metals Shining Bright\n\n> While precious metals like gold have been facing their fair share of selling recently alongside rates, elsewhere in the metals markets, industrial metals have been surging. Year to date, industrial metals‚Äîas proxied by the Bloomberg Industrial Metals total return index‚Äîare up 11.43% while their precious metals counterpart is down by over 4%. With a fairly flat January, most of those gains have come from this month alone. As shown below, so far this month the Bloomberg Industrial Metals index has risen 11.41% for its strongest performance through the first 14 trading days of a month since September of 2012. Going back to the start of the index in early 1991, the only other months with stronger performance were March of 2008 (11.42) and April of 2006 (14.94).\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-Metals-1.png))**\n\n> Again, whereas industrial metals are flying, precious metals have been trending lower since the summer. In the chart below, we show the relative strength of the Bloomberg Industrial Metals index versus the precious metal counterpart index over the past five years. Times that the line is rising indicates outperformance of industrial metals and vice versa. Precious metals had been outperforming since mid-2018, but the relative strength line bottomed out back in August of last year. From then through the late fall, industrial metals outperformed, and after some consolidation from November through the end of January, industrials are once again outperforming in a big way.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021921-Metals-3.png))**\n\n> Delving deeper, tin, copper, and nickel have been leading in those gains.

The old market adage ‚Äústairs up, elevator down‚Äù certainly rang true over the coming weeks, as the S&P 500 recorded the fastest bear market (closing 20% below a previous all-time high) in history, accomplishing that feat in a mere 16 days.\n\n> The stock market is a peculiar mechanism however, and despite the turmoil the world has experienced since the outbreak of the pandemic, the S&P 500 marched forward to set new all-time highs less than 6 months later on August 18 and hasn‚Äôt looked back. So after such a wild year since the market peaked on this day in 2020, what have we learned?\n\n> **1. Markets are forward looking.** While it‚Äôs difficult to pin down a date when we can expect our lives to completely return to normal, the stock market is already pricing in the normalization of daily life, even if that remains uncertain. Economic conditions around the world have been improving relative to how they were at the beginning of the pandemic. While pockets of weakness remain, the market is more concerned with where the economic conditions will be, not where they are currently.\n\n> **2. Sector performance is dynamic.** Investing in ‚Äústay at home‚Äù themed growth and technology stocks whose earnings were viewed to be relatively well insulated by the effects of the pandemic and subsequent lockdowns provided both downside protection during the March volatility as well as outperformance after the market bottomed. However, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, conventional early-cycle leadership from financials and energy stocks has emerged over the past three months:\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2.19.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> **3. Remember your timeline.** Everyone would love to be able to pull their money at the exact top, avoid all major market corrections and reinvest at the bottom, but unfortunately, there is no holy grail timing mechanism and market volatility is the cost of admission for stock investing. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs our jobs as investors to focus on our long-term goals,‚Äù noted LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúDrawdowns and bear markets are part of the path to get there, and limiting the latest shiny object from affecting our decisions is key to any investment strategy.‚Äù If an investor pulled their money from the market during last year‚Äôs volatility, there have been a plethora of reasons to be hesitant to reinvest it, and the subsequent bounce from the lows happened in a flash, meaning they may have bought back in at a higher price than they originally sold.\n\n> Thankfully, bear markets and extreme volatility like we experienced last year are rare, but they provide a unique learning opportunity for investors. No one truly knows what the future holds for the stock market, so making sure we learn from the past is crucial for long-term success as investors.

The sharp increase in new COVID-19 cases led to additional curbs on activity to contain the virus, triggering a rise in weekly jobless claims, and many feared we might have a double-dip recession.\n\n> Sensing a need to act, Congress passed a fifth relief bill at the end of December, including additional direct payments to households. The lame-duck injection of fiscal stimulus to the US economy was just what it needed. Following a weak retail sales number in December‚Äîordinarily one of the strongest months for retail sales‚Äîconsumer spending rebounded firmly in January, rising 5.3% month over month according to the US Census Bureau‚Äîthe most in seven months‚Äîand greater than all of the estimates in the Bloomberg economist survey.\n\n> Looking under the hood makes the headline number even more remarkable. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the largest month over month increases came in categories associated with discretionary spending, including a 23.5% surge in spending at department stores:\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Blog-2.18.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> ‚ÄúFiscal stimulus was just what the doctor ordered for the US consumer in January,‚Äù added LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúThe boom in spending on discretionary categories could become a trend if a wave of pent-up demand gets unleashed on the economy in 2021.‚Äù\n\n> Clearly, direct payments to households had a major effect on January‚Äôs retail sales, so does this mean that February sales will disappoint? Not exactly. Direct payments to households totaled roughly $166 billion, but the increase in January sales was only $29 billion and the savings rate remains high. Of course, not all of that money was spent on retail items, but there may be some gas left in the tank for February retail sales, particularly by individuals who didn‚Äôt receive their payments until later in the month or who will be receiving a credit on their federal tax returns.\n\n> Earlier this month, we raised our gross domestic product (GDP) forecast for the US from 4‚Äì4.5% to 5‚Äì5.5%. Yesterday‚Äôs retail sales number puts us on a solid path toward achieving that target‚Äîand may even raise the prospects of exceeding it. The first quarter of 2021 is expected to be the weakest of the year, so the January surge in retail sales removes much of the risk of the US economy stumbling out of the gates as we begin 2021.\n\n> However, a strong start to the year may embolden the call for a smaller price tag for President Biden‚Äôs fiscal stimulus proposal. Despite this, we ultimately believe a stimulus package north of $1 trillion is likely, which should prime the US economy for continued growth in 2021 as the battle against COVID-19 improves.\n\n*****\n\n> # Tech Leading in New Highs\n\n> The S&P 500 has been reversing from its record highs over the past couple of sessions, but on an individual stock basis there are still a large number of names that have reached new 52-week highs. As shown in the charts from our Daily Sector Snapshot below, through yesterday's close, a net percentage of just over 15% of the S&P 500 reached new 52-week highs. That is the strongest reading in new highs since January 12th. Outside of several days at the start of 2021, the only other days of the pandemic era with as high if not higher readings were September 2nd, October 9th, and November 9th. Most of the sectors are also seeing their number of new highs rise to strong levels. In addition to the S&P 500, yesterday's reading for Communication Services, Financials, Materials, and Tech all were in the top decile of all days since at least 1990. In the case of Materials, while new highs have been trending higher and yesterday's reading was historically strong, it was still well off the record highs from earlier this year.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021721-NNH.png))**\n\n> On the other hand, perhaps the most impressive sector in terms of net new highs has been Technology. Yesterday, 35.53% of the sector's stocks reached a new 52-week high. Not only is that the highest reading with respect to the other sectors, but that high reading also stands in the top 0.5% of all days for the sector since at least 1990. In other words, there have only been 38 other days since 1990 that the Tech sector saw as strong of a reading in net new highs as yesterday. The most recent of those was November 9th when 43.84% of the sector touched a new 52-week high. Overall, in the context of more broadly positive breadth with strong readings in new highs for other sectors, Tech's large number of new highs is an added plus for the broader market given the massive 28.08% weight of the sector.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021721-NNH-Tech.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Small Cap Growth Taking the Lead\n\n> One of the topics we covered in last Friday's Bespoke Report was the outperformance of small caps over the past year. Even on a much shorter time horizon, that outperformance has been evident. As shown in the snapshot of our Trend Analyzer below, in the five days ending last Friday and on a year to date basis, both Small Cap Growth (IJR) and Small Cap Value (IJS) have been two of the top-performing ETFs in our US Styles screen while large-cap counterparts have also been higher but with more modest gains. With a particular focus on growth stocks, while the S&P SmallCap 600 Growth (IJT) ETF was up the most of these ETFs last week with a 3.96% gain, the S&P 500 Growth ETF (IVW) was the second-worst performer after 'only' rising 1.05%. That continued a trend that has been in place YTD with the performance spread between the two ETFs topping ten percentage points.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021621-TA.png))**\n\n> We are coming up on the one-year anniversary of the last highs on February 19th, 2020 just before the COVID crash. For most of the past year since then, large-cap growth (IVW) had actually been outperforming small-cap growth (IJT), but since the new year began, small-cap growth has jumped ahead. Now, the S&P Small Cap Growth ETF (IJT) is up 35.31% since the 2/19/20 high compared to a 28.16% gain for the S&P 500 Growth ETF (IVW). As shown in the second chart below, IJT had been catching up on IVW for some time now though. The relative strength line of IJT versus IVW had been in a downtrend for most of the past five years meaning large-cap growth had been generally outperforming the small-cap counterpart. Since the lows last March, the line trended sideways meaning neither one saw significant outperformance, but come the fall, the line has taken off in favor of small caps. With more outperformance in the past week and a half, that line has turned sharply higher once again reaching the highest level since December of 2019 last week.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021621-Small-vs-large-2a.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Is A/D Line Signally Late-February Weakness?\n\n> Back on January 21 in our February Almanac post our Market Probability Chart highlighted the pattern of late-February seasonal weakness. A disappointing jobless claims number today appears to be the straw the sent the market lower. In this chart of the NASDAQ 100 Index (NDX) I have overlaid the NASDAQ Composite Advance/Decline Line. The NASDAQ A/D Line peaked and flattened out about six trading days ago and is now heading lower.\n\n> This coincides with the seasonal pattern of late-February weakness. However, we expect recent support to hold above 13,000. Should that level be breached major support exists around the old September doji high of 12,240. Considering how far the market has come in the face of some formidable economic and pandemic obstacles and how frothy sentiment had become, a little consolidation and pullback is to be expected.\n\n> We may see some further weakness into month-end and into March, but with vaccine rollout gaining some traction, more stimulus likely and a supportive Fed we do not expect any major selloff at this juncture.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/e5f4b2427b7d5d4b28aae29e57eecf9b/74d4cbea052ab1c5-33/s500x750/45f747ae1ae952b17ebfa05517216899ec4f49ae.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/uT5kxuP.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/jtxCols.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S MARKET OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/b6PPTlQ.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 2.22.21 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/EcVeV4l.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 2.22.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/Iz5xLzt.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday  2.23.21 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/4p4q8a9.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 2.23.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/EgzN86P.png))\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/ODRTBoH.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 2.24.21 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/3udXvVZ.png))\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/sMcEWeM.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 2.24.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/EHTrDMd.png))\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/bzVMSxO.png))\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/79N1qSy.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 2.25.21 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/WwOgLCj.png))\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/wZD3pAb.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 2.25.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/FztoNlM.png))\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/MuAL2DJ.png))\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/gkCoskC.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 2.26.21 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/UCHvMLo.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 2.26.21 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/To6WCZh.png))\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # NVIDIA Corp. $597.06\n**NVIDIA Corp.

Some of those ETFs had GME getting upwards of 20% of the ETF value; making it possible for them to buy, say, $10 million of the ETF to get $2 million of GME shares _without having to go buy GME on the market_, which enabled them to avoid squeezing the price up further.\n\n\n(Note: you can also just hand them money which they use to buy shares in the appropriate ratio, creating more shares of the ETF; this is what you and I do with mutual funds quite regularly in our 401k, but big money can do this with ETFs as well.)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "wow crazy, i have been trading all these years and i never knew you could do this.

I've never been involved in the finance industry at quite that level so I don't know what _exactly_ is involved in the transaction, but this is not that uncommon; I know the Bloomberg Terminal has some NAV percentage offset screener the big money guys can use to find ETFs that are far enough away from the NAV to execute this arbitrage by redeeming ETFs or handling bundles of shares to ETFs. It's a bit trickier to execute it in the \"create shares\" direction with index-tracking ETFs because you have to hand them shares in a close enough ratio that they aren't diverging too far from the index but most ETFs deliberately reserve a fraction of a percent of a cash buffer which they can use to even things out, or they could charge a fee for this, etc. To tell the truth, this is all probably detailed somewhere in the prospectus none of us ever actually read.\n\n> The other thing, is that really true that every time we buy an ETF there is a new share issued? How is that not dilution?\n\nNo, the way you buy ETFs on the market is you're buying shares from someone who's selling them. The AUM and number of shares doesn't change with an ordinary ETF transaction - this is the whole \"Exchange-Traded\" part of \"Exchange-Traded Fund\", after all.\n\nBut remember, ETFs came _after_ mutual funds, those were the original. When you buy into a mutual fund, yes, new shares (or fractional shares) are created, but that's not dilution because you've added your money to the pool of investment that the mutual fund uses, which they buy stocks (or bonds or whatever) with. In fact, you're going to get exactly as much out in the mutual fund shares as what you put in. And when you sell shares of a mutual fund, this is exactly what's going on behind the scenes - they're selling some shares of the underlying stuff (or more likely, using that cash buffer) to pay you out.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "makes sense. So, if these big money guys are using these NAV to execute this arbitrage, do you believe the stock market is efficient? We are technically told that the stock market is efficient and there are no real opportunities for arbitrate because of free flow of info and all", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "> there are no real opportunities for arbitrate because of free flow of info\n\nWell, it's more that who's going to be able to make money when some ETF is trading at 5 cents below its NAV? You, the guy who can buy 10 shares of the ETF for a couple thousand bucks, or some hedge fund that can buy 200,000 shares of the ETF for less than the NAV, exchange them for the stocks in the ETF, and sell those, all in the same trading session? Or if the ETF is trading at 5 cents above its NAV, how are you going to be able to get enough shares of everything in the correct ratios to cash in for shares of the ETF? You have to have giant piles of money in order to do this kind of arbitrage, and realistically it's only going to make you a relatively small percentage. But this is of course exactly what (some types of) Wall Street specialists _do_ for a living, scalp these tiny percentages using giant amounts of money, and that makes the market super efficient, which is generally a good thing. It brings everything closer to the correct price relative to each other. Even HFTs, which get a bad rap overall, buy and sell shares across different exchanges in order to bring their prices closer together (taking the pennies' difference for their own profit, of course). \n\nIn the GME case, the GME squeezers are upset about this because they want the squeeze to fire and make a bunch of money, but from an economic perspective, \"unlocking\" the shares that were in the ETFs was a good thing as it brought the price of GME closer to the \"correct value\".\n\nI don't think the market is efficient in the super-strict sense of \"everything is at exactly the correct price no matter what, just buy VT and go away\". (If it was, the put/call ratio would forever be 1, right? If the put/call ratio isn't 1, either the stock market is wrong or the options market is wrong!) The stock market is efficient in the sense that big money is going to swallow damn near all the arbitrage opportunities out there unless you come up with something really really clever nobody's thought of before, or you just find something that's out of whack by so small an amount that it just isn't worth it for the big guys to scalp. (Say you find $10 on a low-vol options arbitrage, minus transaction fees, and there's only 1 available on the market at that price, so who cares really? Certainly not the guys throwing around millions of dollars at once.)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6675648093223572}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4090530276298523}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6921690106391907}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5817237496376038}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5390903353691101}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.47391849756240845}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.031270768493413925}, {"body": "Less than the squeeze.

{"title": "Volume the final frontier and why itll help you make money", "selftext": "I made this to help you noobs who dont know shit about stocks. This is part 1 of a series aimed at helping you guys have a fighting chance against wallstreet. Remember you are going against the sharpest minds in the world and you will lose. But you have me in your corner and im rooting for you guys, I believe in you\n\nVolume\n\n-A trend that moves on steady volume means that its likely to continue aka price is rising or price is lowering\n\n-Falling volume means that a trend is likely to reverse, whether price is going up or down, it applies to both\n\n-A burst of extremely high volume means that its trend is likely to reverse. Usually when the stock reaches its peak or when all of a sudden it crashes, keep your eye on the volume\n\n-If there is Low volume and the price stays the same, it usually means thats this is the new normal price. People are unfazed by slight price changes here, this is the new normal\n\n-A second price breakout after one just occured is usually marked by yet another high volume spike. It usually means losers are heading for the exit because theyve been bag holding and cant take the pain anymore or bulls are jumping back in\n\n-a price breakout in low volume means that its fake, the price will recoil\n\n-rising volume during a rally(after a stock crashed)means that even though the bagholders are leaving, new losers are coming in\n\n-When volume shrinks during a rally, it means that bulls arent as eager to keep buying at these high prices. Fuel is being removed from this ship. A reversal is imminent \n\n-When volume dries up during a decline, it usually means a reversal. That is the bears are no longer shorting and the intelligent bulls who got out a long time ago are ready to pounce yet again\n\n-As a rule of thumb, if todays volume is higher than yesterday‚Äôs, it means that a trend is likely to continue \n\n-Volume is relative, what is high for ibm may be low for apple. What is low for apple may be high for ibm\n\n-As a rule of thumb, high volume is 25% higher than the avg volume of the past 2 weeks and low volume is 25% lower than the avg volume of the past 2 week\n\n-High volume confirms new trends. If prices rise to a new peak, and volume reaches a new high, then prices are likely to retest, that is go below the peak and come back to the peak to see if it can exceed it or go back down.\n\n-If a stock falls to a new low, and volume reaches a new high then that bottom will also retest- that is go up and come back down to that bottom to see if it goes even lower or stays there\n\n-the true bottom of a stock occurs on low volume and is always retested at low volume. If it stays the same then this is a great buying opportunity \n\n-if volume shrinks during an upwards or downwards trend then that trend is ripe for a reversal \n\n-When a stock reaches a new peak than it was yesterday, but the volume is lower today than yesterday- this is a great shorting opportunity, that is: Now is the time to sell or time to buy puts\n\n- This does not work on a downwards trend as a stock can keep going down even with low volume. It takes buying to move a stock up, but a stock can go down on its own weight\n\n-Watch volume during a reaction against the upward trend(aka panic selling). If the dip continues but volume shrinks, it means bulls are no longer running or selling pressure is spent. When the explosion of selling volume dries up, then it means that the upwards trend will resume. This presents a good buying opportunity or to buy calls\n\n-Many downtrends are punctuated(occurs at intervals) by rallies(price goes up momentarily)which begin on heavy volume. These shake out weak bears which causes volume to shrink and gives a signal to sell short~ this means that short sellers are now sure that the stock will crater because no more rallies\n\n:thanks for the love.
