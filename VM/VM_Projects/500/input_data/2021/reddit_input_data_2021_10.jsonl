You're thinking about price the right way, as premium (time value) + parity (stock-strike).

The mkt is. The fact that you are surprised by that probably means there is a trade to be made (sounds to me like you think its too low). Keep in mind that the premium in the 20c is the same as the premium of the 20p at all times. We can talk about either those ITM calls or the put, it doesn't really matter since we are discussing premium only. \n\nSo the question becomes how much do you think the time value should be? Why? Is time more valuable when VXX is lower or when VXX is higher? If VXX goes down, does it go down fast or slow? What if it goes up? If time value is a proxy for \"price of protection\", do you think people are more likely to want to purchase protection when VXX is up or when it is down? Does their willingness to buy protection change the higher or lower it goes? \n\nThese are hard questions, but there are essentially how the market prices volatility curves, which is the premium in options.

That seems strange since the time doesn't differ between those two...just the intrinsic value. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI fully understand the arb argument you made above and see that the ITM call can't be valued the way I thought, but then that begs the question of where that difference in time value is coming from.

You would expect the $100 call 40 DTE would have some time value, right? Well, what about the $1 call? What is the probability that a $1 call will be worth parity after 40 days? Practically 100%, right? It's effectively the chance that the company won't go bankrupt in 40 days.

You can make a perfectly acceptable diagonal spread with that strike.\n\n>  Not sure if this in general was a mistake to close out a contract so early,\n\nNot only is that *not* a mistake, that is the best way to roll profits out of a diagonal spread.

Rather, exercise requests go into a sort of queue, and everything gets mopped up overnight.  What happened to you is how assignment works.  It's how the OCC works.  It doesn't vary by broker.\n\n>  \n>  \n>How do you guys think I can avoid this situation in the future? I'd like the long leg option to be exercised when the short leg is exercised.\n\nYou can avoid the situation by being aware of when you have a short call and there is an upcoming dividend date.  You can check to see whether you're at risk of early assignment by determining whether the dividend exceeds the extrinsic value of the call.  If so, you can avoid this situation by buying to close the short call before the ex-dividend date.  If you do get assigned, you can't have the long leg exercised when the short leg is assigned, and you usually wouldn't want to anyway, because you'd be giving up the remaining extrinsic value on the long leg. Better to sell it and buy to cover the short shares on the open market.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>In my case, closing the short position before the market open on 10/5, do I still need to pay the ex-dividend?\n\nI've never heard of a brokerage processing a request to exercise outside of market hours.

You sell to open a put spread on ABC at the 100/105 strikes, both OTM around 30 delta. The 105 strike pays $6 in credit and the 100 strike costs you $5, for a net $1 credit on a $5 spread.

The market seems less interested in the 100 strike for reasons that are not clear. It only goes up to $5.25. To buy to close, you have to pay $13 for a put you only got $6 for, netting a $7 loss, and you have to sell a put for $5.25 that you paid $5 for, gaining $.25. .25 - 7 = a -$6.25 loss.

So if you wrote a 4400/4410p Nov 19 spread, closed for a loss, and then wrote an identical 4400/4410p Nov 19 spread, that would certainly be a wash sale.\n\nWhere things get a lot more fuzzy is if the spread is slightly different, like 4400/4410p Nov 19 AM vs. PM expirations, or 4400/4410p Nov 19 vs. Nov 26, or 4400/4415p Nov 19.

They have no impact on your taxes, as long as you keep both ends of the wash sale in the same tax year, and dispose of the loss-carrying position in the same tax year.\n\nWash sales just add the loss to the cost basis of the disqualifying trade. So instead of deducting the loss directly, you \"carry it forward\" to the new trade. The deduction becomes \"built in\" to the gain/loss of that new trade. So you get the tax deduction one way or the other.\n\nIt's only a problem if that new trade isn't disposed of in the same tax year. If you have a $1000 loss in 2021 but you don't close the carry forward trade until 2022, you don't get the benefit of the $1000 loss on your 2021 taxes, you'll get it in 2022.\n\nSo **TL-DR**, as long as you dispose/close wash sale carry forwards in the same tax year, you can ignore wash sales completely.

DIS earnings day (the day it was going to move off of the numbers) was Friday Nov 8 2019. They had announced Disney+ earlier that year, and basically it was going to launch over the weekend.

But the real kicker was basically that they said \"We are going to give you a ton more info over the next 2 weeks, including how many first day signups, what membership types people are signing up for, and the content roll out\". IV just exploded as soon as the market opened, while the stock basically did nothing from the opening gap up (since all the fun news was going to come the next week and no one was going to try and trade it before then) and weeklies got destroyed.

Yea you'd be short vol, but the wings would actually *gain* vega as vol went up, so those would help. Your trade would blow the fuck out.

Should I try to roll my puts or average down or should I try to catch it as it falls?\n\nTerminology. You started by asking about short positions, then talked about (presumably long) puts. A put is not a short. It's a *bearish directional play*, and so is shorting shares, but that doesn't mean a put is a short, any more than a call is a deed to some real estate, even though they both want the price of the underlying to go up.\n\nThe old phrase \"stairs up, elevator down\" is relevant here. Declines tend to be sharper and shorter in duration than rises. That means that timing is that much harder to get right on bearish plays. So you need to use strategies that spread out your risk of getting the timing wrong. Rolling puts on some schedule is one way to do that. Shorting shares is another (no expiration, so you can basically hold indefinitely, as long as you have the buying power to avoid a margin call).\n\nIf you decide to roll puts, you need to define an upper limit on either the total holding time, the total capital outlay, or both. Say you think the correction will happen within 30 days. You do a weekly put that is 2 weeks out and roll at the end of each week. So for example this Monday you might open the Nov 5 and then roll out to Nov 12 on Oct 29. But you only do that through Dec 3 or something like that. Or, alternatively, you give up after you've spent $X on puts that did not pay off.\n\nIf you are completely unsure about when the event will happen, it's best to just short shares and avoid expiration timing altogether.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "One method is a ratio spread.  \n\nSell a put at the money, buy two puts out of the money, located where the net will be a modest credit, say 0.50.   \n\nFor a 60 to 90 day period.  \n\nThis works best for low implied volatility envirionments.  \n\nExit **before** the mid-point of the term to expiration  \n (30 days, or 45 days for the two examples)   \n to avoid the pool of loss on modest down moves.  \n \nThis is for big moves down. \n\n\nExample with SPY  \nLINK:  http://opcalc.com/ClS    \n \nBuy 21 Jan 2022  $420.00 Put\t2 --\t$6.44\t  \nSell 21 Jan 2022  $452.00 Put\t1  -- $13.99\t \nNET\tCREDIT  $1.11  \n\nCollateral of  $3200 required. \n\n---  \n\nAnother method is a calendar spread.  \nYou could put out a fleet of these, expiring monthly.  \n\n\n\nHere a DIAGONAL Calendar  PUT Spread   \nIntending to reduce the cost, with the short higher than the long.   \n\n**RISK** if the stock goes rapidly down, and if it goes below the LONG PUT.\n\nExample with SPY  \nLINK:  \nhttp://opcalc.com/ClW     \n \nSPY Diagonal Calendar\nBuy 17 Dec $420.00 Put\t1\t$3.67\t \nSell 3 Dec $430.00 Put\t1\t$3.31\t \nTotal\t$0.36  Debit  \n\n$1000 collateral required.  \n\nYou could enter with two separated calendar spread to capture modest moves down. \n\nHere that might be   \nDec 17 $425 2x Long put // Dec 3  2x $430 short  put   \nDec 17 435 1xlong put // Dec 3 $440 1x short put.  \n\n\n\n---", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I’ve noticed with my broker, that when I’m selling puts and I have cash, it’s automatically made as a CSP.

If they don't have anything to spend the money on, they send it to us as dividends\n* Dividends reduce the value of the company, and the shares, but we get the value in cash instead\n* When the company doesn't pay a dividend, they're using that revenue on our behalf to invest in the company to increase the value of our assets in the long term\n\nSo the revenue per share is what you get every year from the company, you either get it directly as a dividend, or you get it as an investment in your asset. Either way, that's how much benefit you get from owning a share. The price of the share is the cost to secure that stream of revenue. So then the question becomes \"how many years of revenue do I need, to make the cost of the share worthwhile?\"\n\nIf a company has a PE ratio of 15, it means it costs you 15x their last year's revenue to purchase the company. For companies that aren't growing or shrinking much, and hopefully pay drive dividends, this is a very useful metric. If you pay 15x revenue, and hold for 5 years, that means you've earned 1/3 the cost of your share back, and you've still got the share to sell. If your hold for 15 years, then in a way you've gotten all the cost of your share back, and anything else you get at that point is pure profit. And it means that given similar risks, all companies with a PE of 15 are giving about the same return.\n\nBut that's assuming that the future looks like the past. If the future is different than the past, then a backwards looking PE might but not be very useful at all. For example, if a company is increasing it's revenue at 100% per year, then in 15 years you'll have gotten about 1000x the first year's revenue, not 1x.\n\nPE ratios are just a simplified price tag, and they can work great.

Tesla is moving from charging a flat price for FSD to a subscription model. Under such a model, it would be pretty easy to envisage Tesla licensing the technology to other makers for 50%.

And it didn't cost me 20 years of my life. But it was an older that was pretty much unliveable. I only paid $48k. I lived in the apartment I was renting while I renovated it. I did 100% of the work myself with help only from my brothers and a couple friends in the evenings and weekends. They only helped on big parts of the renovation. \n\nIt was my first home and I actually borrowed more than 100% of the value of the home. Purchased the home with 0% down, and had a secondary loan from the same bank that was 80% of the proposed post renovation value of the home.\n\nI was able to finish the renovation having spent very little of my own money. Spent roughly $100k on the home, it appraised for $135k. Refinanced the 2 loans into a single mortgage, still not coming out of pocket at all yet.\n\nFew years later I decided to move to a different city. Sold that house for $165k. Instead of buying another home in the new city I moved into an apartment and used the equity from the sell of the first home as down payment on a nice townhome right in downtown. I never spent more than a few minutes at a time at this property, I immediately started renting this home out.\n\nPurchase price was around $200k, rent was $1600 a month. My mortgage was $800.\n\nAfter 1 year of ownership I went back to the bank, they no longer viewed the house as a liability against my debt/income, but rather a cash flowing asset and source of income.\n\nAt this point I had saved up enough of a down payment to buy another home, taking out yet another mortgage. I moved into this home.\n\nLather, rinse, repeat. 10 years later (from buying my first home) I now have multiple rental properties, have flipped several homes and properties and the home I currently live in ($345k value) has no mortgage on it.\n\nWhen I started this adventure I was only earning about $45k a year.

He also must have peered into the future and took a page from the modern Left because he stuck his nose, face, and a fist into the Supre Court's deliberations and manufactured support for Dred Scott.  In his final address to Congress he basically blamed the North for the imminent secession, saying they were being obnoxious, while also saying that the South should just stfu.  In the election after his one term, he failed to do *anything* to bring his party together, instead tepidly supporting his vice-president, despite pretty much everyone else wanting Stephen Douglas.  Buchanan supported the Corwin Amendment which would have put an amendment into the Constitution saying that Slavery could not be stopped by any *other* Amendment.  Fortunately, that was DOA. He then followed this by completely fucking up the start of the Civil War (which occurred after Lincoln had been elected but before Buchanan was out of office).  He made a half-hearted attempt to help Fort Sumter and then literally did nothing.  People forget that early in the war the South vastly outperformed expectations, and a good deal of that is because Buchanan did nothing to get the military ready to suppress an active rebellion.  He also left the country in $17M of debt, despite his promises to do the exact opposite.  He supported the North in the war, but in the most lukewarm fashion, again managing to piss off both the north and the south simultaneosly.   BTW, the Civil War was known as Buchanan's War around the time it was fought.  \n\nGranted, Pierce was also a fucking train-wreck (understandable given the horrible things that happened to his children, particularly his son after he was elected), but Buchanan pretty much guaranteed we would have a Civil War that dragged out via his ineptitude both before the war, and right after it started. \n\n\nBy the way, do you ever just marvel at the murderer's row of presidents we had just before and just after Lincoln?  Filmore, Pierce, Buchanan, (Lincoln), Johnson, Grant.  In retrospect, perhaps if the people preceding Lincoln hadn't been so bumbling we wouldn't have needed Lincoln in the first place.  Also, the retroactive air-brushing of Grant the past decade or two has been ridiculous.  Check out [these](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_rankings_of_presidents_of_the_United_States) rankings, and look at the ones for Grant from pre-2000.

Kansas was Buc's attempt at compromising and holding peace.  Most people either forget or never even knew that the Civil War wasn't started for the right to keep slaves - it was started because the modernized and mechanized North passed laws stating that contracts to expand west could not be done with slaves, which was basically the North's way of fucking over the South (which had no railroads or modernized means of production) and ensuring that the South would get NONE of the money for the western range expansion.  It was some robber baron bullshiit. Lincoln didn't even abolish slavery until the Civil War was well underway (it was, what, something like 2 years in by the time he issued the Emancipation Proclamation?). To use WSB terms, the North were the hedge funds, and the South were the guys who got slapped with PDT restrictions.  Now, were his methods in trying to avert war sound?  Ehhhh, mixed bag, mostly no.  But he was at least trying.  Pierce wanted to create a scar (and did so).  He was inept, but he wasn't evil.  Pierce was.  Plus, it's just poetic that Pierce's presidency was capped off by finding out his own party wasn't going to nominate him for re-election, so he got drunk then ran over and killed a woman with his horse, becoming the first president to get a DUI :P.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe TL:DR here is nothing Buc did had lasting resonating effect on the country for generations.  He was a one-shot and everything he was involved in was ultimately forgettable and had no permanent effect.  What Pierce did created a scar that still lingers 200 years later.  What Carter did by giving away the most important shipping lane in the entire world was ensure generations after would suffer additional costs for goods (also something that continues to this day).

If you can borrow money for 0 collateral and 0 interest definitely do it. There's no downside. Private companies did the same. This is how Trump actually failed us. The economy was doing great when he took over and he pressured the fed to keep interest rates low (replacing Janet Yellen with Jerome Powell to do so and later openly blasting Powell his own appointee for higher interest rates) to make himself look better and even tried to make interest rates negative in the US.

We gradually ease up interest rates so it costs just a bit more to borrow. Companies will report lower profits and govt has to ease up taxes a bit to cover the difference.

Now, not sure if that is just from increased efficiency in the battery or also from being able to deplete it further (i.e. in theory a capacity increase), but seems with the 4680's Tesla's batteries will match of exceed the efficiency of Lucid's battery, with no clear way to improve on efficiency (tabless cells should be near 100% efficiency).\n\nThinking about it this way, makes sense how Lucid did what they did. It also strongly indicates that their batteries are expensive, as adding those extra tabs is not going to be an efficient process, like the 4680's.\n\nJust some food for thought here. If I am right, it helps explain why Lucid's cheaper models (the upcoming Touring and Pure) are not price-competitive and don't have better specs than a Model S LR. Simply put, the batteries Lucid is using is too expensive. 118 kWh's at $150 per kWh (making up numbers here) is $17.7K for a battery pack. On the other hand a 100 kWh pack (more efficient and gives lots of weight reductions so Tesla will actually get competitive range with less kWh's) at $75 per kWh is only $7.5K.\n\nFurther, if I am right, then bottom line being the best at manufacturing will be what sets Tesla apart.

I don't think there is any doubt that battery efficiency is not perfect, so if you can improve that you can get more output miles per kWh. The 4680's with tabless have 5X the capacity and 6X the power and get 16% more range. That tells you, reducing electrical resistance improves battery efficiency. Hence, I suspect Lucid is using customized and expensive cells with extra tabs attached in order to achieve greater efficiency. Could be I am wrong, so would really like to see a teardown.
