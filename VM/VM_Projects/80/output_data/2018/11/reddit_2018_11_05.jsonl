Basically, a shareholder writes these contracts off as \"I'll give you stake in my shares for x price.\" So, in effect, you're leasing them, minus the risk. A call is an agreement that the writer of the contract will sell you the shares at the listed price by the date listed on the contract, in this case, $230 on January 18 of next year. If the share price reaches that target price before the date, then the contract becomes \"ITM\" or in the money, and holds its value a bit better than when it as \"OTM\" or out of the money. As the stock price goes up, so does the value of the contract, with a couple caveats: the value of a contract will always decrease as it approaches the target date, mainly due to \"IV\" or implied volatility. The reason is that, as time runs out, the stock has a shorter time to reach that target price, or still go up if it's ITM. This is called IV Crush. For this reason, you always want the stock to rise faster than the contract value can decay.\n\nAs for put options, they work similarly, however, instead of someone agreeing to sell you those 100 shares, they offer to buy them from you at the target price. Applying a little logic here means that you want the value of the stock to go down so that the gap between the price you buy them and the price you sell them to the contract writer is as large as possible, making the money you earn greater. \n\nOptions contracts can be bought and sold just like stocks as well, so this guy can sell those contracts off to another investor and take profits now if he so chooses.

Basically, a shareholder writes these contracts off as \"I'll give you stake in my shares for x price.\" So, in effect, you're leasing them, minus the risk. A call is an agreement that the writer of the contract will sell you the shares at the listed price by the date listed on the contract, in this case, $230 on January 18 of next year. If the share price reaches that target price before the date, then the contract becomes \"ITM\" or in the money, and holds its value a bit better than when it as \"OTM\" or out of the money. As the stock price goes up, so does the value of the contract, with a couple caveats: the value of a contract will always decrease as it approaches the target date, mainly due to \"IV\" or implied volatility. The reason is that, as time runs out, the stock has a shorter time to reach that target price, or still go up if it's ITM. This is called IV Crush. For this reason, you always want the stock to rise faster than the contract value can decay.\n\nAs for put options, they work similarly, however, instead of someone agreeing to sell you those 100 shares, they offer to buy them from you at the target price. Applying a little logic here means that you want the value of the stock to go down so that the gap between the price you buy them and the price you sell them to the contract writer is as large as possible, making the money you earn greater. \n\nOptions contracts can be bought and sold just like stocks as well, so this guy can sell those contracts off to another investor and take profits now if he so chooses.
