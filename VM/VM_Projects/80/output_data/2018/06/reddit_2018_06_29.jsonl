{"title": "Tesla Reaches Moment of Truth in Mad Dash to Make 5,000 Cars Per Week", "selftext": "[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-29/tesla-reaches-moment-of-truth-in-mad-dash-to-make-5-000-cars-per-week](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-29/tesla-reaches-moment-of-truth-in-mad-dash-to-make-5-000-cars-per-week)\n\nIt\u2019s been another rough quarter for the rollout of [Tesla Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/TSLA:US)\u2019s Model 3. The factory was shut down at least twice for [extensive upgrades](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-06-08/tesla-model-3-photos-of-elon-musk-s-factory-in-fremont), a new production line was hastily erected in a\u00a0[tent in the parking lot](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-25/the-future-of-tesla-hinges-on-this-gigantic-tent), and Tesla Chief Executive Officer\u00a0Elon Musk moved from sleeping on the couch to [sleeping under the desk](https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-races-to-exit-teslas-production-hell-1530149814). He was [even seen personally\u00a0torquing bolts](https://twitter.com/S_Padival/status/1009956753272782848) on an assembly line, alongside a summer intern.\u00a0\n\nNow the mad scramble to meet a self-imposed production deadline\u2014a rate of 5,000 cars per\u00a0week by the end of June\u2014is coming to\u00a0an end. The quarter concludes\u00a0Saturday, and Tesla is expected to report its production figures for the last three months before the July 4 holiday.\u00a0Tesla has repeatedly fallen short of its own manufacturing targets. Now investors will find out exactly how many cars Tesla made, sold, and stockpiled and what sort of weekly rate they were finally able to achieve.\n\nHere\u2019s our rundown of what to\u00a0expect.\u00a0\n\n## Seeing a Shortfall: Bloomberg\u2019s\u00a0Model 3 Tracker\n\nBack in February, Bloomberg introduced an experimental tool\u00a0to\u00a0[track the Model 3 rollout](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2018-tesla-tracker/). The tracker\u00a0uses vehicle identification numbers (VINs) to estimate production in real time. The model projects\u00a0that Tesla finished the quarter making\u00a027,957 Model 3s\u2014or\u00a04,533 per a week, shy of\u00a0Musk\u2019s goal.\u00a0Since production of the Model 3 began in July 2017, the Bloomberg tracker estimates that\u00a040,409 of the sedans have been made.\u00a0  \n\n\nMusk himself has suggested that\u00a0this estimate\u00a0is too low. An analyst report by Goldman Sachs, which projected quarterly production\u00a0that\u2019s just 43 cars more than the Bloomberg estimate, prompted the CEO to\u00a0send\u00a0an email to his employees. \u201cThey are [in for a rude awakening](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-27/musk-says-rude-awakening-awaits-bearish-goldman-sachs-analyst),\u201d Musk wrote.\u00a0\n\nThe Bloomberg\u00a0model is, by design, slow to reflect sudden shifts in production and could underestimate Tesla\u2019s last-minute manufacturing\u00a0push that spilled into a gigantic tent outside the factory in Fremont, California. Back in the first quarter, the Bloomberg Model 3 Tracker underestimated the actual production total by less than 5 percent\u2014coming closer than\u00a0the Wall Street consensus. The tool\u00a0doesn\u2019t estimate total deliveries, which can vary based on the number of cars in transit at the end of the quarter.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n## Wall Street Doesn\u2019t Think Tesla Made It\n\nWall Street has also been placing their bets on Tesla\u2019s quarterly figures. The average of eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg projects\u00a0second-quarter Model 3 deliveries of 26,121 cars.\u00a0Three\u00a0analysts also gave estimates for production, which averaged 30,167.\n\nThe number most people are watching is Tesla\u2019s weekly production rate, a squishy figure that Musk has set up as his quarterly benchmark. Tesla initially targeted a rate of 5,000 per week by the end of 2017, but the company has since moved that target back twice.\u00a0Only one firm stuck their\u00a0neck out with an\u00a0estimate of weekly production: Evercore ISI\u00a0predicts that Tesla will hit 4,600 during the final week.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nTotal shipments for Models S and X are expected to be around 22,622 units, according to an average of six estimates.\u00a0\n\nOne thing that makes this quarter particularly hard to assess is the approaching expiration of the U.S. tax credit for electric vehicles. [Tesla may be\u00a0suppressing](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/live-blog/2018-03-12/insights-on-telsa-model-3-bloomberg-tracker#5B2D2D9D68C80000) U.S. sales as the quarter ends as way\u00a0to extend its federal electric-vehicle tax credit\u00a0of $7,500 per car. The subsidy begins to phase out\u00a0one full quarter after the quarter in which Tesla\u00a0sells its 200,000th\u00a0electric car in the U.S. By hitting that milestone after July 1, rather than a day earlier, Tesla would gain\u00a0an additional three months\u00a0of tax credits that\u00a0could be worth [more than $400 million](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/live-blog/2018-03-12/insights-on-telsa-model-3-bloomberg-tracker#5B2D66D868BC0000) to Tesla customers, according to Bloomberg estimates.\u00a0\n\nIn June, Tesla filled Model 3 orders to reservation holders in Canada ahead of deliveries to some U.S. customers. There are other actions Tesla may be taking, including accelerating its overseas deliveries for the Model S and Model X and stockpiling cars at holding facilities, all of which could push\u00a0quarterly revenue into the third quarter, which is when\u00a0Musk vows that Tesla will finally become profitable.\u00a0\n\nTesla\u2019s stock has been on a tear in the second quarter, boosted by apparent\u00a0progress on Model 3 production. The stock has climbed\u00a031 percent\u00a0to close at\u00a0$349.93 on Thursday. Tesla\u2019s market value reached $59.4 billion\u2014more than long-established rivals General Motors Co. and Ford Motor Co.\n\nHere\u2019s a roundup of what analysts\u2019\u00a0are saying ahead of the key delivery figures:\u00a0\n\n**Goldman Sachs, David Tamberrino:**\u00a0  \n**(**Sell, price target $195)\n\n* \u201cWe believe that Model 3 deliveries are tracking below consensus.\u201d\n* \u201cInvestor conversations on the stock have moved past the 5,000/week run-rate production target (as we believe most investors are giving the company credit for achieving this level entering third quarter) toward vehicle profit margins and conversion of Model 3 reservations to higher priced vehicles.\u201d\n* Forecasts Tesla achieving about 22,000 Model 3 deliveries to customers in the quarter, up from Goldman\u2019s previous 19,000 estimate, but well below consensus.

The paint shop will need to have capacity added to handle 10,000 Model 3/week in addition to 2,000 S/X per week.\u201d\n\n**Bernstein, Toni Sacconaghi**  \n(Market-perform, price target $265)\n\n* Says Tesla\u2019s Automotive segment\u2019s gross margins may be overstated, noting a steep plunge in the gross margins of the Services and Other segment.\n* Expects second-quarter Model 3 deliveries of 26,000.\n\n**Evercore ISI, Arndt Ellinghorst & George Galliers**  \n(In-line, price target )\n\n* Expects Tesla to deliver \u201c21,800 Model S/X during the quarter and 30,700 Model 3, with Model 3 production at a run-rate of 4,600 during the final week versus guidance of 5,000.'\u201d\n* Notes comments by Panasonic executive that a pick-up in Model 3 production has resulted in occasional battery shortages.\n\n**Guggenheim, Robert Cihra**  \n(Buy, price target $430)\n\n* Still sees Tesla flipping from \u201closses to profits in second half of 2018\u201d and the prospect of a profitable Tesla setting up a \u201cmeaningfully more positive stock narrative.\u201d\n* \u201cTesla producing as many as 35,000 Model 3s and shipping 29,000, up from just over 8,000 in the first quarter and 2,000 in the fourth quarter.\u201d\n* \u201cWhile 6 months later than projected, we continue to estimate that 5,000/week bogey then setting up Tesla\u2019s overall model to flip from sizable cash burn in first half of 2018 to profitability in second half, as Model 3 volumes drive big revenue, margin and free cash flow leverage off the big fixed-cost structure Tesla has been building.\u201d\n\n**Consumer Edge, James Albertine**  \n(Overweight, price target $385)\n\n* \u201cProduction of the Model 3 is still the primary driver of upside to expectations and shares in 2018.\u201d\n* \u201cWe visited the Gigafactory in May, which is when we learned about Tesla\u2019s push to 5,000 units per week of Model 3 production by second quarter-end, a goal we believe many investors did not believe management could achieve prior to our visit.\u201d\n* Estimates second-quarter Model 3 deliveries to stand at 25,000 units.\n\n**Baird, Ben Kallo**  \n(Outperform, price target $411)\n\n* \u201cWe expect the focus will be on exit rate Model 3 production and total Model 3 production in June, in that order, and believe the stock could trade up if Tesla approaches its 5,000/week production target.\u201d\n* \u201cWe think TSLA may deliver about 25,000 vehicles.\u201d\n* \u201cConsensus estimates for second-quarter deliveries may be too high, particularly given our belief there could be a larger-than-normal delta between production and deliveries due to the ramp during the quarter.\u201d", "id": "8uu222", "created_utc": 1530286477.0, "score": 279, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 91, "comments": [{"body": ">One thing that makes this quarter particularly hard to assess is the approaching expiration of the U.S. tax credit for electric vehicles.

The factory was shut down at least twice for [extensive upgrades](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-06-08/tesla-model-3-photos-of-elon-musk-s-factory-in-fremont), a new production line was hastily erected in a\u00a0[tent in the parking lot](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-25/the-future-of-tesla-hinges-on-this-gigantic-tent), and Tesla Chief Executive Officer\u00a0Elon Musk moved from sleeping on the couch to [sleeping under the desk](https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-races-to-exit-teslas-production-hell-1530149814). He was [even seen personally\u00a0torquing bolts](https://twitter.com/S_Padival/status/1009956753272782848) on an assembly line, alongside a summer intern.\u00a0\n\nNow the mad scramble to meet a self-imposed production deadline\u2014a rate of 5,000 cars per\u00a0week by the end of June\u2014is coming to\u00a0an end. The quarter concludes\u00a0Saturday, and Tesla is expected to report its production figures for the last three months before the July 4 holiday.\u00a0Tesla has repeatedly fallen short of its own manufacturing targets. Now investors will find out exactly how many cars Tesla made, sold, and stockpiled and what sort of weekly rate they were finally able to achieve.\n\nHere\u2019s our rundown of what to\u00a0expect.\u00a0\n\n## Seeing a Shortfall: Bloomberg\u2019s\u00a0Model 3 Tracker\n\nBack in February, Bloomberg introduced an experimental tool\u00a0to\u00a0[track the Model 3 rollout](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2018-tesla-tracker/). The tracker\u00a0uses vehicle identification numbers (VINs) to estimate production in real time. The model projects\u00a0that Tesla finished the quarter making\u00a027,957 Model 3s\u2014or\u00a04,533 per a week, shy of\u00a0Musk\u2019s goal.\u00a0Since production of the Model 3 began in July 2017, the Bloomberg tracker estimates that\u00a040,409 of the sedans have been made.\u00a0  \n\n\nMusk himself has suggested that\u00a0this estimate\u00a0is too low. An analyst report by Goldman Sachs, which projected quarterly production\u00a0that\u2019s just 43 cars more than the Bloomberg estimate, prompted the CEO to\u00a0send\u00a0an email to his employees. \u201cThey are [in for a rude awakening](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-27/musk-says-rude-awakening-awaits-bearish-goldman-sachs-analyst),\u201d Musk wrote.\u00a0\n\nThe Bloomberg\u00a0model is, by design, slow to reflect sudden shifts in production and could underestimate Tesla\u2019s last-minute manufacturing\u00a0push that spilled into a gigantic tent outside the factory in Fremont, California. Back in the first quarter, the Bloomberg Model 3 Tracker underestimated the actual production total by less than 5 percent\u2014coming closer than\u00a0the Wall Street consensus. The tool\u00a0doesn\u2019t estimate total deliveries, which can vary based on the number of cars in transit at the end of the quarter.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n## Wall Street Doesn\u2019t Think Tesla Made It\n\nWall Street has also been placing their bets on Tesla\u2019s quarterly figures. The average of eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg projects\u00a0second-quarter Model 3 deliveries of 26,121 cars.\u00a0Three\u00a0analysts also gave estimates for production, which averaged 30,167.\n\nThe number most people are watching is Tesla\u2019s weekly production rate, a squishy figure that Musk has set up as his quarterly benchmark. Tesla initially targeted a rate of 5,000 per week by the end of 2017, but the company has since moved that target back twice.\u00a0Only one firm stuck their\u00a0neck out with an\u00a0estimate of weekly production: Evercore ISI\u00a0predicts that Tesla will hit 4,600 during the final week.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nTotal shipments for Models S and X are expected to be around 22,622 units, according to an average of six estimates.\u00a0\n\nOne thing that makes this quarter particularly hard to assess is the approaching expiration of the U.S. tax credit for electric vehicles. [Tesla may be\u00a0suppressing](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/live-blog/2018-03-12/insights-on-telsa-model-3-bloomberg-tracker#5B2D2D9D68C80000) U.S. sales as the quarter ends as way\u00a0to extend its federal electric-vehicle tax credit\u00a0of $7,500 per car. The subsidy begins to phase out\u00a0one full quarter after the quarter in which Tesla\u00a0sells its 200,000th\u00a0electric car in the U.S. By hitting that milestone after July 1, rather than a day earlier, Tesla would gain\u00a0an additional three months\u00a0of tax credits that\u00a0could be worth [more than $400 million](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/live-blog/2018-03-12/insights-on-telsa-model-3-bloomberg-tracker#5B2D66D868BC0000) to Tesla customers, according to Bloomberg estimates.\u00a0\n\nIn June, Tesla filled Model 3 orders to reservation holders in Canada ahead of deliveries to some U.S. customers. There are other actions Tesla may be taking, including accelerating its overseas deliveries for the Model S and Model X and stockpiling cars at holding facilities, all of which could push\u00a0quarterly revenue into the third quarter, which is when\u00a0Musk vows that Tesla will finally become profitable.\u00a0\n\nTesla\u2019s stock has been on a tear in the second quarter, boosted by apparent\u00a0progress on Model 3 production. The stock has climbed\u00a031 percent\u00a0to close at\u00a0$349.93 on Thursday. Tesla\u2019s market value reached $59.4 billion\u2014more than long-established rivals General Motors Co. and Ford Motor Co.\n\nHere\u2019s a roundup of what analysts\u2019\u00a0are saying ahead of the key delivery figures:\u00a0\n\n**Goldman Sachs, David Tamberrino:**\u00a0  \n**(**Sell, price target $195)\n\n* \u201cWe believe that Model 3 deliveries are tracking below consensus.\u201d\n* \u201cInvestor conversations on the stock have moved past the 5,000/week run-rate production target (as we believe most investors are giving the company credit for achieving this level entering third quarter) toward vehicle profit margins and conversion of Model 3 reservations to higher priced vehicles.\u201d\n* Forecasts Tesla achieving about 22,000 Model 3 deliveries to customers in the quarter, up from Goldman\u2019s previous 19,000 estimate, but well below consensus.
