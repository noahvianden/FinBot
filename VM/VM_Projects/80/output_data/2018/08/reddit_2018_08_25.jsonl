When people short the Tesla stock it indicates they think it\u2019s overvalued and should go down. Elon doesn\u2019t like this. He had many tweets talking negatively about short sellers. His latest stunt about bringing Tesla private made a lot of short sellers lose many millions of dollars. It\u2019s now turning into possible stock manipulation and the company (and its shareholders) now risk getting a big fine due to Elon\u2019s stunt that some speculate was just done to hit short sellers.\n\nElon seems to have become too much of himself and seems to think he can say and do whatever he wants. He has a great vision and ambitions but this has started to be overshadowed by his personality and tendency to send out stupid tweets.
