{"title": "Probably going to go ~max margin short for CPI + some thoughts", "selftext": "Through some introspection, and recognition of my inability to stop myself from YOLOing (which is why I have found myself back here even though I said I would take a break), I will concede that some of you may have been right about me potentially having a gambling addiction. I looked through some gambling addiction symptoms, and let's just say I recognized one or two of them in myself (maybe a little more). I am probably going to have to put some safeguards up sooner or later to protect myself from myself. I recognize I already won the game at this point, and I'm fking over myself and my family with my actions. YOLOing max margin short/long in concentrated positions is not normal behavior, but I'm having trouble from stopping myself. I don't think that me posting YOLOs on WSB helps either. We underestimate tail risks (even if you know that you underestimate tail risks), and we underestimate how losses (and wins) can trigger a feedback loop of possibly portfolio-ending decisions. Fk. I really don't want to screw up.\n\n**ANYWAYS! BACK TO THE POINT.**\n\nI am going to likely go \\~MAX margin short for CPI on Thursday. Everyone and their dog is thinking we get a cool CPI print. We MIGHT, but I think the upside is limited even if we do (FED members speaking that day will likely talk the markets down if we rip) + cooler CPI print seems like it's already priced in (market is poorly hedged for the downside). But if we get a hot CPI, we might get a re-run of what happened during the September CPI print (it wasn't pretty). Basically, IMO, the r / r is skewed towards the downside, and I cannot say no to shorting that. The bear market rally already happened, and it's behind us IMO.\n\n**IMO:** \n\n**CPI HOT -> Higher rates for longer, stocks down.** \n\n**CPI LOW -> Likely indicates demand destruction, bearish for earnings, stocks down (maybe up in the immediate term, maybe not). Might be a sell-the-news event)**\n\nI already have a large short position using quite a bit of leverage, so I will need to sell my only remaining long position (ASTS) to initiate a bigger short position. They are expected to fully validate the technology by t+6 months from launch, and that gives us a \\~mid-march date. I really do not want to miss out on the potentially explosive upside (eg. if they announce the test results were successful earlier than I imagined), so I will keep a core position. Probably somewhere between 10-20k shares. I will be selling the rest tomorrow, in hopes of playing the short side of the market and in hopes of entering long again in ASTS in the future (hopefully I can get the timing down).\n\nI will hopefully post what I short end up shorting tomorrow. This is also contingent on us being \\~ the same price level or higher when I get the chance to sell ASTS and +initiate more shorts.\n\nSome of the stocks on my short watchlists:\n\n$CRM\n\n$NFLX\n\n$LI\n\n$SQ\n\n$DASH\n\n$UBER\n\n$CAT\n\n$DE\n\n$NVDA\n\n\\+ A ton more.\n\nNone of this is financial advice, and without notice, and at any given moment, I can open new positions and close any position that I may have. I might also change my mind on how I view these companies and the broader market. As always, do your own DD, and never risk what you cannot tolerate losing.

We underestimate tail risks (even if you know that you underestimate tail risks), and we underestimate how losses (and wins) can trigger a feedback loop of possibly portfolio-ending decisions. Fk. I really don't want to screw up.\n\n**ANYWAYS! BACK TO THE POINT.**\n\nI am going to likely go \\~MAX margin short for CPI on Thursday. Everyone and their dog is thinking we get a cool CPI print. We MIGHT, but I think the upside is limited even if we do (FED members speaking that day will likely talk the markets down if we rip) + cooler CPI print seems like it's already priced in (market is poorly hedged for the downside). But if we get a hot CPI, we might get a re-run of what happened during the September CPI print (it wasn't pretty). Basically, IMO, the r / r is skewed towards the downside, and I cannot say no to shorting that. The bear market rally already happened, and it's behind us IMO.\n\n**IMO:** \n\n**CPI HOT -> Higher rates for longer, stocks down.** \n\n**CPI LOW -> Likely indicates demand destruction, bearish for earnings, stocks down (maybe up in the immediate term, maybe not). Might be a sell-the-news event)**\n\nI already have a large short position using quite a bit of leverage, so I will need to sell my only remaining long position (ASTS) to initiate a bigger short position. They are expected to fully validate the technology by t+6 months from launch, and that gives us a \\~mid-march date. I really do not want to miss out on the potentially explosive upside (eg. if they announce the test results were successful earlier than I imagined), so I will keep a core position. Probably somewhere between 10-20k shares. I will be selling the rest tomorrow, in hopes of playing the short side of the market and in hopes of entering long again in ASTS in the future (hopefully I can get the timing down).\n\nI will hopefully post what I short end up shorting tomorrow. This is also contingent on us being \\~ the same price level or higher when I get the chance to sell ASTS and +initiate more shorts.\n\nSome of the stocks on my short watchlists:\n\n$CRM\n\n$NFLX\n\n$LI\n\n$SQ\n\n$DASH\n\n$UBER\n\n$CAT\n\n$DE\n\n$NVDA\n\n\\+ A ton more.\n\nNone of this is financial advice, and without notice, and at any given moment, I can open new positions and close any position that I may have. I might also change my mind on how I view these companies and the broader market. As always, do your own DD, and never risk what you cannot tolerate losing. Love you all, and wish you all the best. \u2764\ufe0f", "id": "108ymvh", "created_utc": 1673421628.0, "score": 85, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 88, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|0|**First Seen In WSB**|2 months ago\n**Total Comments**|636|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|2 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\n ^^[**Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse) ^^[BanBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/banbets/)  ^^VoteBot ^^[FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/votebot/) ^^[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/leaderboard/) ^^- ^^[**Keep_VM_Alive**](https://www.patreon.com/visualmod)\n>TL;DR: Looks like I have a gambling addiction, so I will be shorting more things, and selling ASTS to do so.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Don't forget the max-margin part ![img](emote|t5_2th52|27421)", "score": 6, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.21419350802898407}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.17207282781600952}, {"body": "Silver lining - if you are wrong, you will have contributed to reducing aggregate demand, which will positively affect the next CPI print.", "score": 124, "replies": [{"body": "![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)", "score": 40, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.047000009566545486}], "tickers": ["cpi"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "You wrote a lot.
