Electricity works when you need to cover short distances\u2026\u201d\n\nAnd he\u2019s right.  More range means more batteries/weight, and that\u2019s less cargo moved per trip.  It makes them ineffectual for long range.  That\u2019s why legacy manufacturer Class 8 trucks only have a range of 200-300 miles\u2026  To keep truck weight down.  And those EV day cabs weigh more than the OTR 587 Petes in my fleet (72\u201d sleeper, 300 gal capacity, 2000+mile range, tractor weight is about 20k lbs).  \n\nIt I were to estimate the weight of the 500 mile range Tesla Semi, I\u2019d guess it\u2019s north of 28 lbs, maybe even 30k+.

And that lines up with the hundreds of ANB/Pepsi/Coke BOLs and scale tickets I have that show each trip moved 46k-47k of cargo.   If my trucks were set up as day cabs, they\u2019d weigh 3k-5k less; so they\u2019d likely have a legal payload of 50k+ lbs.  \n\nGranted, EV semis can gross an extra 2k lbs, but the legacy manufacturer EVs typically weigh about 5k more than my OTR trucks (around 25k+).  Those EVs are already hauling less tonnage than their ICE counterparts per trip.  How much weight is Tesla\u2019s extra 200-250 mile range add?

The current diesel National PUMP average is $4.56 and $0.35-0.60 of it is taxes that get counted towards IFTA road use taxes.  The quarterly IFTA taxes have to get paid regardless if it\u2019s ICE or EV, and carriers don\u2019t attribute those fuel taxes to fuel cost.  Plus, corporations with hubs don\u2019t pay pump prices.  They buy in bulk and have their own fuel islands on site.  Bulk diesel prices currently average about $3/gal.\n\nThe average MPG of a loaded day cab is over double your quote; around 9-11 mpg.  This means for 1000 miles, it would cost $300 in fuel; or $0.30 a mile.  Driver wages are typically about double that, or $0.60 a mile.\n\nAnd you\u2019re missing a massive variable: number of loads in that 1000 miles.  The EV that managed to do 1000 miles in one day hauled 4 loads.  Even being generous and saying it was grossed out on weight, at most it moved 160,000 lbs 1000 miles.  An ICE day cab would move over 200,000 lbs in the same time frame (1 day, 24 hours).  That\u2019s 40k lbs more a day.\n\nIOW, it\u2019s not \u201c$1000 for 10,000 lbs of cargo\u201d.  It\u2019s $300 in fuel to move 200,000 lbs with an ICE truck.\n\nBut don\u2019t forget charging cost of the EV.  Tesla has stated they average 1.7 kWh per mile.  The National average commercial cost per kWh is $0.1252.  It cost $212 in electric to move 160,000 lbs.  To move 200,000 lbs, it would cost $265.\n\nSo $35 less means it\u2019s cheaper, right?

For instance, for years (over a decade) there hasn\u2019t been enough parking spaces for semis in general.  It\u2019s why you can routinely see them parked on on/off ramps at night.  It will take years to just get that parking situation taken care of.  It\u2019s estimated there\u2019s only 1 parking spot for every 11 trucks on the road.  \n\nThrow in the fact that then they\u2019d also need chargers and the massive infrastructure to supply power, how long will that take.  Plus, the increased Wh/kg is great and all for increasing range, but that means each battery will need that much more power to charge.  The Tesla Semi with 500 mile range is estimated to have a 800-1000 kWh battery.  OTR trucks routinely do 600-700 a day with a single driver and 1400+ with a team.  Even with a \u201clowball\u201d 1000 kWh for a OTR truck, many truck stops have enough parking for 100 trucks.  That\u2019s a megawatt of power every night as a conservative estimate for each truck stop.  But then there\u2019s huge truck stops like the Iowa 80 that has 900 parking spots.  This is just barely touching the problem with what it\u2019s take to support EV OTR trucks even when the battery capability exists.  \n\nThe only reason anyone does it today is because it\u2019s companies moving hub to hub freight where they have chargers present.  And that\u2019s the only way it\u2019d be \u201ccheaper\u201d than ICE too.  Look at any thread that brings up only using public chargers to charge their cars and the operating cost is typically the same or slightly less than a gas car.  With a semi, there is no \u201ccharge at home\u201d option unless it\u2019s a company truck at a company\u2019s hub.   \n\nICE day cabs can compete because there\u2019s more in the cost per mile than just fuel (which is still a significant part).  Things like driver wages and insurance make up a considerable portion.  The figures I listed above use very conservative weights for the EV tractors.  Because EV tractors are so heavy, they\u2019re payload is 8k-10k lbs less than ICE competitors; even with the extra 2k lbs they\u2019re allowed to gross.  It roughly means that 5 loads an ICE day cab can haul would take an EV truck 6 loads.  That\u2019s extra time to pay the driver, extra time for the dock worker, and more wear on equipment to move the same amount of freight.  So when you say they \u201cincrease driver efficiency\u201d, I don\u2019t know what efficiency you\u2019re referring to.\n\nPlus, down time is a massive loss.  It\u2019s not just a matter of getting trucks into the shop, but having the parts available to fix them.  The more obscure the part, the more likely there will be long down time.  I\u2019ve had a truck down for a month because a part wasn\u2019t available.  That cost the company $10s of thousands.  \n\nThat\u2019s why this Run On Less event is giving lots of detail on mileages and being extremely vague on weights.  They\u2019re showing literal charts of miles driven during what hour of day on a few select standouts, but when it comes to actual loads, it\u2019s \u201call the trucks combines have moved ____ lbs since the event began\u201d.  \n\nI\u2019m all for advancement and better equipment.  Frankly, right now it\u2019s in its infancy.  There\u2019s so much that needs to be improved before it becomes a viable industry standard, and I don\u2019t see that happening for 15 years minimum; probably more like 20+", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Definitely agree build out both in charging infrastructure and in the batteries in the trucks themselves are going to be a big limiting factor.

This is clearly plain wrong. That's only possible if you're being robbed by the charging company, and not something Tesla owners nor EV trucks are going to worry about. I feel like this is the major point of disagreement? You seem to think that fuel savings will be minimal when it's basically on the order of 50-70% off.

Everything there is overpriced because trucks/drivers are at their mercy.  There\u2019s nowhere else available; either the truck doesn\u2019t fit or they aren\u2019t allowed.  You\u2019ll often see \u201cdelivery only\u201d or \u201cno truck parking\u201d signs.  That doesn\u2019t mean you can get away with parking there to run inside to buy stuff real quick.  \n\nThe diesel prices you see at the pump are inflated like mad; even at the gas station.  Most small companies use dedicated fuel cards like Fleetone, which gives some discount.  Then if you buy enough fuel at a particular truck stop company, they might offer you a discount; maybe 15-25 cents off, but you have to sign a contract that you\u2019ll buy so much fuel there every month or they\u2019ll fine you.  Large carriers can leverage massive discounts; often $0.50+ discount per gallon (I\u2019ve heard as high as $1+ off) from the truck stop alone.  \n\nIf you want to take a shower, it\u2019ll cost ya normally around $15.

They also charge a premium to reserve a space since parking at night is so limited.  \n\nPublic chargers already cost $0.30-0.65 per kWh.  And the thing is that while \u201cpeak time\u201d for cars is during the day and often around rush hour, the peak time for trucks would be at night when off duty. Thanks to HOS and ELDs tracking, it forces most drivers to stop driving at night since most shippers/receivers are only open 1st shift and maybe 2nd shift.  \n\n\u201cCharge while getting loaded/unloaded\u201d is something commonly said.  Except it ignores that\u2019s a cost a shipper/receiver wouldn\u2019t eat unless they had it for their own trucks.  And in the unlikely event they were to allow it, they would charge even more than the truck stops.  Large companies with hubs often have their own diesel pumps since it\u2019s cheaper to buy in bulk.  It\u2019s unheard of to let a non-company truck use them.  In the most extreme circumstances, it might happen, and the cost would be astronomical.\n\nI can\u2019t help but see the sheer irony of pointing out how fuel costs are so detrimental, yet charging costs and truck stops gouging prices (which are well known to do) \u201care not something they\u2019d worry about\u201d.

Whoever made that decision clearly has never backed up a trailer.  A center seat means that when backing up, both sides are blind sides.  \n\nNot to mention parts and service.  Tesla is well known for having very slow service times; a huge negative in trucking.  Plus, everything on the truck is proprietary; a dealer only part.  If a market light goes out (and they will), that alone shuts down a truck.  Any scale or rod side DOT could shut down the truck and ticket it.  Will Tesla be open, or even have the part in stock?  Meanwhile, there\u2019s 3 Freightliner dealers within 30 minutes of my yard, and 2 are open 24 hours.  Plus most the marker lights on them (which are LED like every other truck built the past 10+ years) are a universal type.  That means Peterbilt has them in stock 5 minutes from my yard and they\u2019re open 24 hours too.  \n\nPlus, Tesla is not known for having durable interiors in their cars.  Truck interiors get beat up (and I can\u2019t stress it enough) a lot.  Seats, armrests, seatbelts, steering wheels\u2026.  I\u2019ve lost track of how many I\u2019ve replaced.  A factory seat may last 400k-700k miles; really depends on the driver.  It could be the armrests are broke off, or the padding is completely worn.

This puts the empty combo weight of my tractor trailers at around 33k lbs.

If my trucks were set up as day cabs, they\u2019d weigh 3k-5k less; so they\u2019d likely have a legal payload of 50k+ lbs.  \n\nGranted, EV semis can gross an extra 2k lbs, but the legacy manufacturer EVs typically weigh about 5k more than my OTR trucks (around 25k+).  Those EVs are already hauling less tonnage than their ICE counterparts per trip.  How much weight is Tesla\u2019s extra 200-250 mile range add?

The current diesel National PUMP average is $4.56 and $0.35-0.60 of it is taxes that get counted towards IFTA road use taxes.  The quarterly IFTA taxes have to get paid regardless if it\u2019s ICE or EV, and carriers don\u2019t attribute those fuel taxes to fuel cost.  Plus, corporations with hubs don\u2019t pay pump prices.  They buy in bulk and have their own fuel islands on site.  Bulk diesel prices currently average about $3/gal.\n\nThe average MPG of a loaded day cab is over double your quote; around 9-11 mpg.  This means for 1000 miles, it would cost $300 in fuel; or $0.30 a mile.  Driver wages are typically about double that, or $0.60 a mile.\n\nAnd you\u2019re missing a massive variable: number of loads in that 1000 miles.  The EV that managed to do 1000 miles in one day hauled 4 loads.  Even being generous and saying it was grossed out on weight, at most it moved 160,000 lbs 1000 miles.  An ICE day cab would move over 200,000 lbs in the same time frame (1 day, 24 hours).  That\u2019s 40k lbs more a day.\n\nIOW, it\u2019s not \u201c$1000 for 10,000 lbs of cargo\u201d.  It\u2019s $300 in fuel to move 200,000 lbs with an ICE truck.\n\nBut don\u2019t forget charging cost of the EV.  Tesla has stated they average 1.7 kWh per mile.  The National average commercial cost per kWh is $0.1252.  It cost $212 in electric to move 160,000 lbs.  To move 200,000 lbs, it would cost $265.\n\nSo $35 less means it\u2019s cheaper, right?

For instance, for years (over a decade) there hasn\u2019t been enough parking spaces for semis in general.  It\u2019s why you can routinely see them parked on on/off ramps at night.  It will take years to just get that parking situation taken care of.  It\u2019s estimated there\u2019s only 1 parking spot for every 11 trucks on the road.  \n\nThrow in the fact that then they\u2019d also need chargers and the massive infrastructure to supply power, how long will that take.  Plus, the increased Wh/kg is great and all for increasing range, but that means each battery will need that much more power to charge.  The Tesla Semi with 500 mile range is estimated to have a 800-1000 kWh battery.  OTR trucks routinely do 600-700 a day with a single driver and 1400+ with a team.  Even with a \u201clowball\u201d 1000 kWh for a OTR truck, many truck stops have enough parking for 100 trucks.  That\u2019s a megawatt of power every night as a conservative estimate for each truck stop.  But then there\u2019s huge truck stops like the Iowa 80 that has 900 parking spots.  This is just barely touching the problem with what it\u2019s take to support EV OTR trucks even when the battery capability exists.  \n\nThe only reason anyone does it today is because it\u2019s companies moving hub to hub freight where they have chargers present.  And that\u2019s the only way it\u2019d be \u201ccheaper\u201d than ICE too.  Look at any thread that brings up only using public chargers to charge their cars and the operating cost is typically the same or slightly less than a gas car.  With a semi, there is no \u201ccharge at home\u201d option unless it\u2019s a company truck at a company\u2019s hub.   \n\nICE day cabs can compete because there\u2019s more in the cost per mile than just fuel (which is still a significant part).  Things like driver wages and insurance make up a considerable portion.  The figures I listed above use very conservative weights for the EV tractors.  Because EV tractors are so heavy, they\u2019re payload is 8k-10k lbs less than ICE competitors; even with the extra 2k lbs they\u2019re allowed to gross.  It roughly means that 5 loads an ICE day cab can haul would take an EV truck 6 loads.  That\u2019s extra time to pay the driver, extra time for the dock worker, and more wear on equipment to move the same amount of freight.  So when you say they \u201cincrease driver efficiency\u201d, I don\u2019t know what efficiency you\u2019re referring to.\n\nPlus, down time is a massive loss.  It\u2019s not just a matter of getting trucks into the shop, but having the parts available to fix them.  The more obscure the part, the more likely there will be long down time.  I\u2019ve had a truck down for a month because a part wasn\u2019t available.
