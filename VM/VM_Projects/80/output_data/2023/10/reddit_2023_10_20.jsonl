From a societal perspective, the only way to \"print money\" is to create value. The dollar is just a physical embodiment of the concept of appreciation. I.e. you give me an apple, and I appreciate it, so I give you a dollar so you can use my appreciation elsewhere. By increasing interest rates, the Fed is just burning dollars by reducing the M2 money supply. That value is taken from borrowers and redistributed to cash holders. There is definitely an initial \"shock\", but all that can happen is the Fed keeps funneling value to cash holders by siphoning it from borrowers which they can do in perpetuity, but borrowers will eventually reach an equilibrium. The only \"shock\" is from the change in rates which causes borrowers to wind down those debt positions. In order to pay off those debts, they need to provide value to cash holders and collect that cash to close their debts. \n\nSo there actually is a \"*reason to think people will get used to higher rates and slower growth any faster.*\" Getting used to lower interest rates takes a lot more time because people are not forced into action. I'm not forced to borrow when rates are 0%. Getting used to higher rates works differently because as rates go up, more and more people are forced to pay off their debts.

Because the United States or I should say the West and the move away from China for strategic reasons so quickly has completely destroyed a lot of our low-cost production. Sure we are setting up factories in Mexico and India quickly and hopefully we can exploit Africa before long but it puts us in this position of having to wait years for supply to catch up. Having so many boomers retire all at once during COVID also reduced productivity. Now they have all this retirement money looking to consume and buy goods during a time that supply still hasn't caught up. You're not solving this with interest rates, you're just going to punish more people\n\nThere's also little discussion of what happens if we break something. What if we wake up to a headline of some major player collapsing. We don't know what kind of risk is out there, we don't know what kind of leverage is out there but we do know the higher rates go the more likely you are to find it. The Fed would quickly reverse course, TLT would go from 85 to 100 in a day or two and then where are we? There are more than a few people who feel that the traders continually shorting these treasuries are doing so in order to purposely break something and trigger this exact situation.

I had several points I need the management team to address... Then one day, activist investor Nelson Peltz highlighted his grievances against DIS. (You can read his letter to Disney management that he wrote approx 1 year ago). His points were very similar to mine! I almost got excited until I read Disney management\u2019s response back to Peltz. It solidified in my head that DIS was absolutely uninvestible. However, in recent months, I\u2019ve taken a position because the management team has gone through several changes which have convinced me they are now willing to listen.\n\nFirst, there has been a hilarious amount of turnover in the management team. Ignoring the CEO change, many of the other executive team has switched, including the woke lady that made a public statement on behalf of Disney against the Florida governor. \n\nAs a byproduct of the management switch, the CEO has declared that they will stop participating in the culture wars. This will be helpful in the long term because DIS is an entertainment company. It makes no sense to push away half your fan-base and make subpar content that people don\u2019t enjoy. In the next 3-6 months, we will likely see the same old shit but I expect that as we get 1 year out into the future, the new Disney content will help with the re-rating of the short term stock price and eventually, the long term profits. \n\nDisney parks and cruises. The cash cow. If you\u2019ve visited Disney recently, you may have noticed some of the rides breaking down or the overall quality of the theme parks being worse. Disney recently announced they are going to double their investment into the theme parks. Before anyone says anything about where Disney will get the cash, there are a few companies out there that have the ability to take on 50 year loans with favorable rates. DIS is one of them. \n\nMy thesis is currently in the process of playing out. I see DIS like a big ship in the ocean that has been slowly drifting towards an iceberg. Slowly. But I also finally see some tangible signs that this ship is starting to turn around slowly and change course. My thesis is a bet on a recovery play and then subsequently, as a long term holding. I have a 2% allocation to DIS currently at a cost basis of $84. I plan to continue to watch DIS and as the company continues to improve and turn the ship towards the correct direction, I will average up and keep buying more. \n\nThat\u2019s the quick and dirty thesis.

The architecture of our society has molded itself to low and declining interest rates to stimulate growth.  \n\nWell. We are now seeing the termination of that policy.

As that happens rates will come down. It's mathematically impossible to have rates like we had decades ago with debt to GDP where it is.

From a societal perspective, the only way to \"print money\" is to create value. The dollar is just a physical embodiment of the concept of appreciation. I.e. you give me an apple, and I appreciate it, so I give you a dollar so you can use my appreciation elsewhere. By increasing interest rates, the Fed is just burning dollars by reducing the M2 money supply. That value is taken from borrowers and redistributed to cash holders. There is definitely an initial \"shock\", but all that can happen is the Fed keeps funneling value to cash holders by siphoning it from borrowers which they can do in perpetuity, but borrowers will eventually reach an equilibrium. The only \"shock\" is from the change in rates which causes borrowers to wind down those debt positions. In order to pay off those debts, they need to provide value to cash holders and collect that cash to close their debts. \n\nSo there actually is a \"*reason to think people will get used to higher rates and slower growth any faster.*\" Getting used to lower interest rates takes a lot more time because people are not forced into action. I'm not forced to borrow when rates are 0%. Getting used to higher rates works differently because as rates go up, more and more people are forced to pay off their debts. I cannot afford to pay 10% interest on my mortgage, so once rates hit 10% I have sell my house and buy something cheaper. \n\nThe only way around that is if I can get someone else to give me a guaranteed rate of 8%.

This is a stock whose current cash flows would justify a much much lower valuation currently but it\u2019s a company that has the potential to turn around. I dislike Iger as a CEO but as he has returned, it seems he has changed his attitude for the betterment of the shareholders and the long term direction of the company. \n\nThe Disney IP is priceless. \n\nI had negative opinions about DIS for years, but I was never a shareholder so I never voiced these opinions. I had several points I need the management team to address... Then one day, activist investor Nelson Peltz highlighted his grievances against DIS. (You can read his letter to Disney management that he wrote approx 1 year ago). His points were very similar to mine! I almost got excited until I read Disney management\u2019s response back to Peltz. It solidified in my head that DIS was absolutely uninvestible. However, in recent months, I\u2019ve taken a position because the management team has gone through several changes which have convinced me they are now willing to listen.\n\nFirst, there has been a hilarious amount of turnover in the management team. Ignoring the CEO change, many of the other executive team has switched, including the woke lady that made a public statement on behalf of Disney against the Florida governor. \n\nAs a byproduct of the management switch, the CEO has declared that they will stop participating in the culture wars. This will be helpful in the long term because DIS is an entertainment company. It makes no sense to push away half your fan-base and make subpar content that people don\u2019t enjoy. In the next 3-6 months, we will likely see the same old shit but I expect that as we get 1 year out into the future, the new Disney content will help with the re-rating of the short term stock price and eventually, the long term profits. \n\nDisney parks and cruises. The cash cow. If you\u2019ve visited Disney recently, you may have noticed some of the rides breaking down or the overall quality of the theme parks being worse. Disney recently announced they are going to double their investment into the theme parks. Before anyone says anything about where Disney will get the cash, there are a few companies out there that have the ability to take on 50 year loans with favorable rates. DIS is one of them. \n\nMy thesis is currently in the process of playing out. I see DIS like a big ship in the ocean that has been slowly drifting towards an iceberg. Slowly. But I also finally see some tangible signs that this ship is starting to turn around slowly and change course. My thesis is a bet on a recovery play and then subsequently, as a long term holding. I have a 2% allocation to DIS currently at a cost basis of $84. I plan to continue to watch DIS and as the company continues to improve and turn the ship towards the correct direction, I will average up and keep buying more. \n\nThat\u2019s the quick and dirty thesis.
