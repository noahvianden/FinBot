{"title": "Why the CT is bullish and your feelings don\u2019t matter.", "selftext": "TLDR: It has better specs than competitors, Tesla is most likely not losing money on it, Tesla will most likely be able to reach 25k production rather fast. \n\nFord has had the lightning, Rivian the RT1, and GM technically sells the Hummer but we won\u2019t be including that for obvious reasons. And then there\u2019s CT, the truck everyone on Reddit hates. Although CT is actually the better vehicle in most cases or at the very least comparable. \n\n**Specs**\n\nRange: RT1 wins by ~15 miles, while Ford is far behind. \n\nTowing cap: RT1 and CT tie\n\nRivian and Tesla are pretty neck and neck for most \u201ctruck specs\u201d like towing, torque, HP. But Tesla has a larger bed capacity at 2,500lbs vs Rivians 1,760lbs. \n\nPrice: There are no outliers, all have comparable price options. Ford has the lowest priced option, but it has far lower specs than what we\u2019re comparing. \n\nCargo: CT wins by 20% given it comes stock with a lockable bed. But it has comparable storage without the bed. It also has the longest bed by almost 6 inches but it\u2019s also the skinniest by 2in. \n\nGround clearance: CT wins, Ford is a low rider with almost 10in less than CT. \n\nCT has better battery efficiency, but the RT1 is extremely aerodynamic. The RT1 is top of the list for aero and overall efficiency. \n\nTop speed, HP, Bidirectional, are all comparable. Ford being the worst in most cases. \n\n**CT has many other features that the other two don\u2019t** and they\u2019re cooler than the RT1 gear tunnel. Steer by wire, is not new tech but it\u2019s new to trucks and iirc is only in a handful of vehicles. Reviews are glowing and the industry has been wanting to switch for a while. \n\nRear wheel steering, makes the turning radius of CT smaller than the model S. it also helps with merging on highways. \n\n*800 volt* architecture. This isn\u2019t a new thing but it\u2019s not common and is very important. It means lower current, less wires, more efficient and lighter vehicle. It also means faster charging. The industry has wanted to do this for a while too but hasn\u2019t. Many will follow. This is part of the reason why CT is lighter than both competitors while being covered in steel. \n\nAlso a 48v system vs 12v like most vehicles. This shares similar benefits as above. \n\nAlthough it\u2019s kind of a meme, CT also has an extended battery option that sits in the front of the bed similar to a tool box. It\u2019s actually a great deal in terms of onboard battery storage and adds over 100miles of range iirc. Great if you would normally use the truck for its onboard power. \n\nIt\u2019s hardened, scratch proof, and lack of paint will make it great for working conditions. Plus now tesla can\u2019t fuck up your paint on delivery. No more rock chips and you probably won\u2019t ever have to replace any windows, no more smash-n-grabs. \n\nInfotainment screen in the back seat for passengers. And the largest screen on the market in the front. \n\nThis is somewhat subjective but Fords software and general UI/UX is arguably well below Tesla and Rivian standards. \n\nRivian and Tesla both come equipped with advanced cruise control systems. I don\u2019t know much about Rivians capabilities. \n\n**DD**\n\nI\u2019m sure I\u2019m missing things. But based on specs, the Cybertruck is the better truck. **The issue is the way it looks.** As we\u2019ve seen on Reddit, everyone thinks it looks terrible. Personally I love the way it looks. \n\nI\u2019m not going to speculate and try and guess how many people might be turned off enough by its looks to not buy it. But we can assume that Tesla will be able to produce a lot of them. Castings are not new to Tesla, these are much larger but even if they\u2019re able to ramp at a fraction of the speed of model Y ramp in Shanghai they\u2019ll be making far more than 100k/year soon. Tesla has said it is possible to hit 250k in two years. \n\nGM isint in this conversation because they can\u2019t make anything with a battery, Ford only made 15k last year and rivian made 25k. Both companies are losing a massive amount of money on every sale. \n\nTesla did say they\u2019d sell CT at a loss if needed, which would imply Tesla isn\u2019t in a loss yet. But given all the new tech I find it a little hard to believe they\u2019re making much on the $80k trim. They\u2019d most likely lose money selling their low trim currently, which would explain why they aren\u2019t selling it. \n\nWith all that said, I strongly believe the CT will be the best selling EV truck rather soon. And will remain there until another more traditional company matches Teslas production.\n\nThere\u2019s also a good chance opinions change around its look once more are on roads and other manufacturers make more \u201cradical\u201d looking cars. If this happens there\u2019s little reason to think the CT won\u2019t be a top seller within EV trucks longterm. \n\nOverall I always thought CT would be great for the company and stock, and after seeing its spec I still feel the same way. \n\nIf I\u2019ve made any mistakes in my comparison please point it out.", "id": "18fiael", "created_utc": 1702256158.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.49, "num_comments": 85, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|10|**First Seen In WSB**|2 years ago\n**Total Comments**|2622|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|3 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n>TL;DR: The Cybertruck is better in pretty much every way when compared to its competition, Tesla is most likely not losing money on it, Tesla will most likely be able to reach 25k production rather fast.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "went to the Tesla Dealership yesterday and there's still people coming in just to look at the Cyber Truck on display.

When I say running out of cash what I mean is that their cash flow is impaired because of demand dropping. You do not do repeated price cuts when demand is strong. They have cash but they do not want to spend through it just for appearances. Now that they have exhausted the price lever they are going to have to turn their attention to the cost side of the equation. I guarantee they will shift to conservation mode and very quickly.\n\nThis is not by the way unique to Tesla. We are seeing lots of companies doing this. Spotify just did it last week. It\u2019s pretty simple. These companies raised lots of cheap capital when interest rates were zero. Now interest rates are much higher and they cannot raise capital anymore. Unless profitability increases or stays the same they cannot spend the same amount without dipping into cash. Therefore they cut costs. Tesla has a demand problem that is not going to change in the near term.\n\nWhere Tesla is different though is that Elon has tried to keep the illusion going that they are limited only by how many cars they can produce and demand is a foregone conclusion.
