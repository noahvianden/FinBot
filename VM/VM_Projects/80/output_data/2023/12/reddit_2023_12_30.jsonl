I assume the Corrola air bags deployed as well.\n\nWe can see the damage of the Corolla. The entire front is destroyed. If the airbags didn't deploy, that would be a huge problem. And the driver would have been clearly hurt. Airbags deploying make more sense. But the driver is also just 17 yrs old. Not likely feeling anything from hitting the airbags right now.

The CT driver will be on the road again within a few hours or a few days max. Could be another car, could be a rental, or could possibly be the CT itself. The Toyota driver will need to buy a new car. But at 17 yrs old, he likely won't get one quickly. And the insurance may not even pay him since the car is very likely liability only (2009 hand-me-down for a kid). While that is circumstantial, what isn't is that the kid who likely was over paying for insurance will now have a wreck with a very expensive vehicle on his record.

The Toyota driver will need to buy a new car. But at 17 yrs old, he likely won't get one quickly. \n\nWhat did you mean when you posted the above?\n\nYou said the CT driver could get a car within a few hours. But not the kid\n\nReally other than money what is the constraint.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "That was a continuation from the previous comment.\n\"And the insurance may not even pay him since the car is very likely liability only (2009 hand-me-down for a kid). While that is circumstantial, what isn't is that the kid who likely was over paying for insurance will now have a wreck with a very expensive vehicle on his record. Most insurance will either no longer cover him or will only do so at very high rates.\"\n\nSo the 17yr old likely won't get money from insurance and will likely have extremely overpriced insurance, if anyone covers him at all. With the 17yr old being, you know, 17, they are also likely a student or at least only have a low end job.
