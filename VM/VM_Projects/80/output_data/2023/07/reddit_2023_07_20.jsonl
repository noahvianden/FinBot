So you have been warned lol, they come after you like Scientologists after you've just bashed their lord and savior L Ron Hubbard.\n\nOne cool thing though is that when they come out of their spaceships to bash you online like most of the comments so far, people are emotional about this stuff and really want to hurt you for just being honest, doing your research, and having an educated fact based opinion about Tesla and their long term outlook. It's not hard to see that with all the controversy, lawsuits, discrimination, sexism, racism, Tesla as well as SpaceX having these issues, you have to start to connect the issues to their leadership. \n\nSure other companies have older methods of staying in the game, the companies and conglomerates and corporations and monopolies are all trying to out perform (at least on paper and on television) their competition while still being able to somehow produce a new product that is better than their last product and continue advancing the human race forward, except that with Elon Musk and Tesla and SpaceX the company has some issues with getting the *entire* human race on board right? Elon Musk definitely doesn't want everyone aboard his Starship and definitely has a political agenda with Tesla at this point even using his influence as an industrialist to curve the political spectrum on what is considered medically healthy and happy and what isn't.\n\nI don't trust a company where the CEO is doing heavy drugs like Ketamine and MDMA, promoting the use of Cocaine and heavy indulgence of THC (Marijuana) as a form of self medication to keep Elon Musk working hard and playing hard as a 50+ year old man/father with maybe 10 children and 5+ companies- tell me how does any one person actually try to even pretend at that point that they care or are 100% focused at the work in front of them at any given time that, as acting CEO and leader of these \"Highest Rated Places\" how does he actually get anything done? The turd man is burnt out, on drugs, high as fuck all the time, and when he isn't he has a random child with him for photo opportunities, pays out of court settlements for one lawsuit after the next, then flies to a country where it's legal to get so high that he doesn't remember the pain of being such an idiot all the time.\n\nYeah Tesla will be a great company to invest in long term, not because of ethical or moral reasons or because the company is \"going places,\" but because the company leadership isn't able to see the difference between making a profitable business decision versus a terrible life choice. \n\nYou can bet that statement is correct just by looking into the Congolese cobalt mines and \"artisanal mining\" operations being conducted for the last 20 years in Africa where Tesla through Glencore/Marc Rich/Belgian White Supremacy, and China's NORINCO (military industrial complex) is centered in the Congo where the worlds largest reserve of cobalt - a necessary mineral/ingredient used in making lithium ion batteries is located and harvested for decades by the local population of Congolese Africans, this population includes their children, pregnant mothers, people are barefoot and gloveless, there are no hard hats or safety equipment, and the mines are dug by hand and basic tools in order to get to the precious cobalt below.\n\nAfter 2013 when Marc Rich the CEO and founder of Glencore passed away and word started getting around about the child labor issues getting out of control, humanitarian aid and journalists attempted to intervene in the affairs of billionaires and war machine alike and, like with COVID19 lockdowns, many people disappeared while traveling foreign countries. Between 2003 and 2014 Tesla had been in production building their Roadster and Model S electric cars for years using cobalt dense lithium ion batteries that were part of the Glencore/Congolese child labor \"artisanal mining\" contracts that Elon Musk- being a child of South Africa and knowing a bit about Emerald Mines (much like Bernard Arnault knows a thing or two about diamond mining) - you'd think that Elon Musk would have created a better contract between Glencore and Tesla to ensure long term sustainability and a much better public relations image than the reality of the local issues and traveling restrictions in place and the liberal use of child labor to conserve as much profit at the top for himself as CEO. \n\nThis is also insightful because it shows that if Elon Musk was unaware of the contract and the loosely regulated mining operations being conducted in the Congo heart of Africa then it just simply shows that Elon Musk doesn't check in with his bottom level workers, he doesn't personally oversee much more than numbers, that whomever Elon Musk blamed for the \"oversight\" and mass use of child labor in the cobalt mines for over a decade while while Marc Rich sat on the throne as Belgian king number 2, while children were dying getting trapped and buried alive in cobalt mines because nobody is there properly managing the mining teams and ensuring that there are safe and a turn over rate that isn't based on the mortality rate.\n\nThe basic difference between a good CEO or leader and bad one is if the adult human sitting in the big boy chair at the top of his pyramid is seeing children going into mines to collect minerals used to make the batteries going into his cars that he is using to surveil and spy and getting sued for btw nonbelievers look it up lol, using Tesla cameras and microphones built in as \"safety\" systems for attempted robbers and car thefts and accidents etc - look it up Tesla getting sued because their employees were literally activating the cameras while they were sitting in their comfy Tesla offices and being technical voyeurs snooping in on customers and listening in on conversations. Real shit.\n\nBeyond the safety issues inside the company, the other issues involving Tesla continuing to use cobalt and mine through Glencore full time, nonstop, not even to slow production or cause a scene because Elon Musk *did* find out about the child labor eventually and decided to curve the amount of cobalt not to save lives but to save money on the cost of battery production by being able to switch the chemistry of the battery towards a different percentage of cobalt Elon Musk managed to save Tesla money while still seeming to look like he was attempting to curve Tesla to a cobalt free supply chain... \n\nSo how does that work? You are just what? Counting less children going into the mine everyday? Because even using a little cobalt means that the demand was so high for over ten years straight that the families of the Congo had to start sacrificing their own children to keep up with Tesla and the other companies requiring MORE ELECTRIC BATTERIES than ever before. \n\nThis includes Elon Musk's Powerwall and Megawall home battery powered systems btw.
