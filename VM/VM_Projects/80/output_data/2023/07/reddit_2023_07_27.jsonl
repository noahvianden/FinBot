{"title": "Meta\u2019s Reality Labs has now lost more than $21 billion since the beginning of last year", "selftext": "* Meta\u2019s Reality Labs unit, which develops virtual reality and augmented reality technologies, logged a $3.7 billion operating loss on $276 million in sales during the second quarter.\n* In June, Meta announced a VR subscription service dubbed Meta Quest+, which costs $7.99 a month.\n* Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently revealed pricing details about the Quest 3 headset just days before Apple announced its Vision Pro VR and AR headset.\n\nMeta reported second-quarter earnings on Wednesday and said that its Reality Labs unit, which develops virtual reality and augmented reality technologies needed to power the metaverse, logged a $3.7 billion operating loss.\n\nThe unit recorded $276 million in second-quarter sales, down from the $339 million in revenue it brought during the first quarter. Analysts polled by StreetAccount were projecting Reality Labs to record $421 million in sales and $3.5 billion in operating losses.\n\nShares of Meta were up about 5% after it reported an 11% pop in revenue as advertising rebounded and the company issued an uplifting sales forecast for the third quarter. It shows that Meta is still very much an ad company with a big cost center.\n\nLast year, Meta\u2019s Reality Labs unit lost a total of $13.7 billion while bringing in $2.16 billion in revenue, which is driven in part by the company\u2019s sales of Quest-branded VR headsets. Reality Labs lost $3.99 billion during the first quarter. That puts its total losses at about $21.3 billion since the beginning of last year.\n\nMeta said in its earnings report that it expects operating losses in its Reality Labs unit \u201cto increase meaningfully year-over-year due to our ongoing product development efforts in augmented reality/virtual reality and investments to further scale our ecosystem.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/26/metas-reality-labs-has-now-lost-more-than-21-billion.html", "id": "15b317a", "created_utc": 1690467317.0, "score": 162, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 104, "comments": [{"body": "Zuck can walk on waters and the haters would say its because he couldnt swim- Margaret Thatcher", "score": 104, "replies": [{"body": "Did she really say that ?
