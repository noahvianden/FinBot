{"title": "Temporary bottom or dead cat bounce?... 3-2-23 SPY/ ES Futures Daily Market Analysis", "selftext": "I had some questions yesterday about my supply/ demand levels on SPY and why they may have seemed \u201coff.\u201d So let me explain a little. \n\nThe gauge/ indicator identifies new levels either supply or demand. and unless it \"takes it out\" then its still there. Thats where this price action on SPY is VERY weird because like you said we should NOT establish a supply and then be over it and be under a demand like that either. however, with the current price action and these wild 1% +/- gap ups/ downs thats where the technicals are showing something that just isn\u2019t quite playing out yet\u2026 it just is an testament to how odd this price action has been and how irrational it truly has been. (below information is from last night not todays charts/ price action). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uq0mqvvcqela1.png?width=770&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c99553eac8d76e2a9eecacb2148c28bc9d3e774\n\nThe issue is that its not flipping the name of supply/ demand but the issue is because SPY is only intraday trading but really its tracking with ES we are getting these massive gap ups that is messing price action up... look at futures and you can see its not like that at all... we ARE breaking through previous 3975 demand but just established a new one at 3960 which makes sense. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lxsr3cedqela1.png?width=778&format=png&auto=webp&s=fdab502cdaf4ec0a8f2df98e699b3db133410ae4\n\nHowever, looking at SPY here this is the issue... so we formed super nice resistance at that 414+ area and then we started our descent and the way the price action has happened we put in demand at 405.74. From there we had a really nice bounce which took out a demand at 409.6... this opens downside back to the demand. So the issue comes in that we had that huge 2% drop last Tuesday which then resulted in a goofy massive wick day on Thursday that established a demand.\n\nThe next issue is that we did not push up to take out the 405.7 demand we just continued to dump.\n\nSame thing this week we had a huge absolutely weird movement on Friday cause of data which put in oddly a supply (granted not a strong one but its there and enough to note)... and now we are pushing back down...\n\nSo what REALLY needs to happen to \"balance\" this out is for SPY to establish demand down here somewhere form 388 to 396. push all the way back to 405.74 demand. and then either retrace to confirm a new demand. or establish that as a new supply and then we can start our fall back down.\n\nSo what im saying and honestly its funny (I posted all this last night in the TA comments but just recapping it) is that we are seeing this play out now\u2026 in this scenario we will push back to 400.7/ 3990 area and then we will be more balanced and looking better technical wise. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yz7cyfwdqela1.png?width=739&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f42bd5fbcd8f454108eaa4206f690c17ea54b3e\n\nIf you were wondering what the change today and the massive pump came from was Bostic\u2026 So just like that a 50bps scare flash crashes the market and then a 25bps discussion spikes the market\u2026 \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cnbypvbeqela1.png?width=772&format=png&auto=webp&s=64ba3c9bd03c6f2ab96c959494289f0c1fa3f2e6\n\nOddly enough the current estimate is still at 30% for a 50bps and has not come down. Im not sure if this CME is live or not so this probably overnight will see an adjustment. \n\nWhere does that leave us then? Are we bullish? Bearish? Or is this a temporary bottom? Relief bounce? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hlwlqdqeqela1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3f2e76daafee875b09fd477e2a1ed38a1f89ee0\n\nLets take a look at our current supply and demand daily levels. Today was a big day for sure. \n\nOn SPY we have established with this push up today 394.7 as a new demand level. With that demand on SPY itself we have an upside demand of 400.7 and 405.7. Now SPY is as I mentioned yesterday in extreme bear momentum so most bounces should reject off the daily 8ema. However, if we can close a green day tomorrow we very well could break that extreme bear momentum as we had just entered it on the 27th and are not very deep into it yet. \n\nIf we can continue momentum tomorrow my target would be 400.7 demand level which is going to corelate perfectly with a daily 20ema resistance test. \n\nOn SPY supply wise we have that 396.5 area and besides that the next major supply level is up near 414-417. \n\nSupply and demand for SPY wise the most bullish case here which is support by indicator is that we will go up tomorrow potentially as high as 400.7 (but honestly we don\u2019t need to go that high), establish a NEW supply somewhere over 396.5. Then early next week a healthy retrace to take out that 396.5 supply and potentially confirm demand at 394.6 would absolutely open upside to 405 area. This is the scenario I most closely am watching for. \n\nOn a bearish supply and demand case for SPY If we were to fail to breakout to 400.7 which is probable since we did not have any meaningful pullback today and we establish a new supply up here this could have been a dead cat bounce. IF that happens and we reject this daily 8ema retest here especially if we double top then I would be eyeing us to come down and retest previous demand at 388.5 early next week. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/39df6aafqela1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=54c744d06402ec781f15e48ac05cdd0b843ad834\n\nTaking a look at the daily chart here you can see we broke through that red falling wedge/ bear channel which does give us upside to the black resistance which will be around 401.9 tomorrow and also coordinates with a daily 20ema resistance retest. \n\nBulls were able to retake the daily 100ema today however, they are going to face heavy resistance as we come into that 400 to 400.6 level as that is the daily 50/200ema and that is previous demand and we should have the daily 20ema lingering right above there. \n\nWith this daily bullish engulfing candle here I remain short term bullish. I really was hoping for this to hold closing to 397 and see a bigger pullback to take out some 15 minute chart supplies down at 396 first. With the daily 8ema being here and extreme momentum we are likely to see a rejection here or at least minimally retest support down below. I was planning to long here with a 30dte call however we did not pullback and I do believe that will come tomorrow. \n\nThere is potential if bulls can close on a bullish note tomorrow\u2026 which would be a close over 396.4 that this is a bullish and I would suspect a run up next week into CPI. \n\nSupply- 396.5 -> 414.13 \n\nDemand- 394.64 -> 400.7 -> 405.7\n\nKey SPY Support- 394.6 -> 392.7 -> 391.5\n\nKey SPY Resistance- 397.9 -> 400 -> 400.7 -> 401.6\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i5444msfqela1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=a62b4a21636a8c4d47c8355c2e07e7bb2d7397bd\n\nTaking a look here at the futures daily supply/ demand chart you can see that we nearly last night came down within 5 pts of the 3920 demand from 1/19. While we did not touch it that is still very bullish in nature to have that long of a wick. Now this is where TOS and TV differ but on TOS this is a double bottom/ bullish engulfing candle with is bullish. \n\nWith a new demand now established at 3960 we have officially taken out previous 3975 demand. You can see though as I mentioned on Spy with us being in extreme bear momentum that the most probable place for a rejection is the daily 8ema which is where we rejected and not only that but we rejected off that 3990 supply. \n\nIf bulls can continue momentum there is a case to be made where we could close over 4020 tomorrow, establish a new supply and then end up coming back down next week to take out 4015 and 3990 supply. This would be very bullish. If bulls lose 3960 on a retest though that would signify that we are gong to come back down to that 3920 demand eventually. \n\nOn the daily I do see on both SPY and futures a IV drop (bullish) and I do see reversal conditions set up volatility wise. This could all set us up for this to actually be the temporary bottom. \n\nMy thoughts are with the fed members talking about 25bps now and talking about how CPI was a fake rebound (or temporary) that this actually is setting us up for a rally back to 405 next week prior to CPI. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6kb5ypbgqela1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=2bc30c7545386ace9f36eaf82b96c3bcc9bce68d\n\nTaking a look here at futures you can see the same thing that we are coming in closely here on the daily 100ema and 8ema. Both of which did hold as resistance today. IF this continues tomorrow upward the 4020 level is going to be a major resistance level as that is going to be the daily 20, 50 and 200 ema along with being a previous supply level. \n\nFrom a bullish standpoint a closure over 3975 tomorrow would be extremely bullish for the weekly timeframe. \n\nSupply- 3990 -> 4015\n\nDemand- 3920 -> 3960 -> 4096\n\nKey Futures Support- 3975 -> 3960 -> 3945 -> 3920\n\nKey Futures Resistance- 3985 -> 3990 -> 4016 -> 4020\n\n**TESLA TA will no longer be included.** I have found I am being pulled in too many places.. my own fault\u2026 I will no longer be focusing on Tesla in my daily TA. It is something I will chat about occasionally but it just isn\u2019t something I plan to trade anymore. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1lyu1pmhqela1.png?width=622&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf12ba2574aecbd5d41656fa7db8637ddf294da4\n\nTaking a look at the VIX here this was a pretty impressive drop on the VIX. We actually have broken back under 19.6 for the first time since February 16th. Which was the first day of the current down trend that we are in. This 19.6 is a pretty major pivot level here and this could also with this massively bearish engulfing candle signify a local bottom. \n\nI do think the evidence of a bottom is there and I do think that if we close over 3975 tomorrow that there is a high probability that we see a push to the upside next week. \n\nNext week is pre-CPI week which historically does move a good amount. The case of a rally into CPI now instead of a dump into CPI is growing here. We have two more fed speakers tomorrow and we will have to see what they have to say compared to what the fed speakers said today. \n\n**Daily trading log-**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t795rq6iqela1.png?width=872&format=png&auto=webp&s=62ddba8f18502744dd6dcfafe93553db4fb256eb\n\nOverall day trading today and really this week has been pretty excellent. I am very satisfied with my trading and how the week has gone. Strictly from a day trading perspective one of my better weeks in a while. \n\nToday I finally cut my AMD and Nvidia swings for a loss from last week. I really should have waited on Nvidia earnings before I opened AMD/ nvidia last week but honestly based off other tech I had very little to suggest they would beat let alone rally 12% like they did. I also though that would be a blow off top and would drop us even lower after. \n\nUnfortunately I considered pretty much all day cutting AMD which was around -25 to -28% all day and Nvidia around -60 to -65% all day. I finally decided by EOD I would cut them and then that investor decided to announce a huge stake in AMD and I watched the price pump $1.2 before my eyes and premiums drop a top. I bailed then and im glad I did as that took a huge pump right after. \n\nLooking at my long puts I was able to close them all besides AMD and Nvidia for profits. I had plenty of opportunities (especially on AMD\u2026) to close them for much less but I kept holding thinking it would finally retrace. \n\nWould I take the play again? Yes but I would have waited till after earnings this time. Not a big deal gonna close my week red but that\u2019s alright. I still like the trade in the end of the day.", "id": "11gj983", "created_utc": 1677798393.0, "score": 75, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 83, "comments": [{"body": "As a daily reader who appreciates your TA I just want to give my feedback that I wish you\u2019d stick to talking about levels of support and resistance, rather than mixing in the terms supply and demand. \n\nSupply/resistance and demand/support are the same thing after all, and interchanging these terms is more messy than it is helpful. \n\nI can understand that you\u2019re using an indicator that uses these terms, but it makes things less reader-friendly in my opinion.\n\nNo hate here, just wanted to share my thoughts.", "score": 42, "replies": [{"body": "[removed]", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "Just want to add in I follow your posts and videos daily and I appreciate every ounce of DD and TA you add.
