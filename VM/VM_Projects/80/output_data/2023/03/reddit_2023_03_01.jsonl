The company reported a loss of $98 million, compared with a loss of $28 million in the year-ago quarter.\n\nProfitability has become a higher priority at Salesforce, which in recent months has been getting pressured by an influx of activist investors, including Third Point, Elliott Management and Starboard Value. The company announced the addition of ValueAct Capital CEO Mason Morfit to its board.\n\nIn January Marc Benioff, Salesforce\u2019s co-founder and CEO, said the company would cut 10% of its workforce, representing over 7,000 people. At the end of the quarter Bret Taylor, who ran Salesforce as co-CEO alongside Benioff, stepped down.\n\nFor the fiscal first quarter, the company called for adjusted earnings in the range of $1.60 to $1.61 per share and revenue of $8.16 billion to $8.18 billion. Analysts surveyed by Refinitiv had been looking for $1.32 in adjusted earnings per share and $8.05 billion in revenue.\n\nSalesforce sees adjusted earnings per share for the full year of $7.12 to $7.14 and revenue of $34.5 billion to $34.7 billion. Analysts polled by Refinitiv had expected $5.84 in adjusted earnings per share and $34.03 billion in revenue.\n\nSalesforce shares have risen 26% so far this year, excluding Wednesday\u2019s after-hours move, outperforming the S&P 500 index, which has gained 3% over the same period.", "id": "11fifvz", "created_utc": 1677705577.0, "score": 392, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 86, "comments": [{"body": "I\u2019m almost certain the WSJ story about Salesforce paying $10 million for McConaughey to be a creative director was a plant. \n\nFrom laughing stock to minds being blown in one day.", "score": 126, "replies": [{"body": "Someone bought options lol", "score": 28, "replies": [{"body": "So is it true?", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.07742910832166672}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.23185910284519196}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4302694797515869}, {"body": "Companies that investors love to hate tend to be outperforming so far this year. \n\nOf course, it is easier to outperform when you cut the easiest expenses to remove...
