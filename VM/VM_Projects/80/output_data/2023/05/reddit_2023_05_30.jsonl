If so then we should see a rejection and actually see a retrace back to at least the daily 8 if not 20ema.\n\nThat gives us a price target of 414.5 to 416.8 for our retrace\u2026\n\nNow in the off chance that we continue to move higher and hold this black bull channel (which support is at 420.3 which means spy has to open green and hold green all day tomorrow)\u2026 if we hold that then our upside target is 425.78. \n\nSPY Daily Levels  \n Supply- 418.78 -> 419.5 -> 429.68  \n Demand- 414.55 -> 410.2  \n Support- 420.2 -> 418.6 -> 417 -> 415.3  \n Resistance- 422.1 -> 425.1\n\n**FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/17crlfif513b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=478e13e629d9a93595a731ffa469877639acaca9\n\nOn Futures it\u2019s the same thing we did not make a new supply and actually the daily DMI on futures shows a little bit more upside to go.\n\nLooking at this until a new supply (resistance) is officially put in this likely is a backtest and bounce off the 4209/4215 supply. However, if a red day is put in tomorrow we likely turn 4240 into a new supply which would take our 4209/4215 and that would then target a breakdown to 4156 and possible 4128 on a bigger sell off. \n\n**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/12vg9uxf513b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf7d088f296407960621afd430e8a34950bae9f3\n\nFutures remains in its black bull channel which has a much more generous support at 4180 for tomorrow and resistance at 4261. A retest of the daily 8ema would give us a bounce near 4200 again tomorrow. \n\nFutures Daily Levels  \n Supply- 4209 -> 4215 -> 4312  \n Demand- 4156 -> 4128  \n Support- 4215 -> 4189 -> 4156  \n Resistance- 4240 -> 4260\n\n**QQQ DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/atnz9ofg513b1.png?width=878&format=png&auto=webp&s=ca5654fe0e539f4a1a549c3fe610790121c71852\n\nNow on QQQ I actually really am looking for a retrace tomorrow\u2026 the daily DMI has hit overbought, and we are nearing a new supply being put in\u2026 we did come up and take our 351.57 demand today also. \n\nIf we put a new supply in tomorrow at 352.68 then our targets would be 347.11 and potentially 337.6 if we see a bigger drop. \n\nHowever, there is a case to be made here if this keeps running that we reach 357.09 and 361.7 demand to take that demand out before we retrace. \n\nHonestly, from a technical stand point QQQ is so over extended it needs a pullback if bulls want any hope at 350-360s\u2026 \n\nThe red bull support sits at 350.7 and resistance at 360 for tomorrow. \n\n**VIX**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y7cjs7tg513b1.png?width=803&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f28d8e180dace0e841bf6ba90c1c9bfdc1a7e1a\n\nNow on the VIX we came within a few pennies of hitting that key 16.92 support before we bounced\u2026 for a while today we attempted to and intended to break back over 17.97 and hold it. However, the EOD push up on SPY was met and led by a nice VIX drop\u2026 this doji here on VIX could with the potential SPY rejection signal a nice upside VIX and downside SPY move tomorrow. \n\nToday was also an anomaly in that the VIX and SPY both closed green today\u2026 \n\n**10YR YIELD and DXY** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t7aday7h513b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e6c776a8c1c537b4a9d5b95a445b547d43160d6\n\nNow one thing that is very interesting to me here is the fact that DXY broke its almost month long bull channel support. However, it is holding that key 103.865 support. But with momentum to the upside breaking on DXY that actually could favor upside on SPY\u2026 the one interesting thing really is the fact that DXY rallied WITH SPY over the last month\u2026 \n\nThe 10YR has the same trend in that it officially broke its uptrend with a rejection off of 3.813%... the key support to watch will be 3.693%.. now with the DXY I cant really wrap my head around why SPY would rally with it and drop with it\u2026 but on 10YR one could say that the 10YR rallying with SPY would be people going RISKY on and then a rejection here would be people going risk off. \n\n**DAILY LOG** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1nepy2lh513b1.png?width=609&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c299f1afad5034994de04bc7e86267ef3f1a468\n\nThis weekend I spent almost a whole half day going through all of my trades over the last month and identifying what was working and what wasn\u2019t working the best\u2026 I came out super excited for my discovery and I did a lot of cleaning up of my charts\u2026 in doing that I actually was able to secure a massive win today\u2026 put in my full weekly profits today\u2026 \u201cMondays\u201d have been extremely great to me so for the last month or so\u2026\n\nI actually really enjoyed trading today\u2026 as you can see there was some struggle in the morning as I kept bitting the recovery that never came (my own fault) and then mid day I struggled with the fake breakdown/ recovery and timing the breakdown\u2026 I definitely got stop loss hunted a few times today but overall a great day of trading mentally and results wise too.", "id": "13w1fwi", "created_utc": 1685479201.0, "score": 97, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 90, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 30, "replies": [{"body": "Nice", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.21154078841209412}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.09356394410133362}, {"body": "Perception is often reality\u2026\n\nAnd Wall St believes Big Tech/AI Tech will outperform the market during the rapidly approaching recession.\n\nProlly a good place to weather the storm.", "score": 21, "replies": [{"body": "When is this rapidly approaching recession coming?

The last \u201cofficial\u201d default date I heard was june 5th. So theyd have 4 days to basically scramble and get it done\u2026 popcorn event Thursday and Friday? \n\n**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aagmcfke513b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d041636290eaf244685e5508b5f688a6069517c\n\nWe did not establish a new supply today, however, we did set ourselves up put a new daily supply in tomorrow\u2026 In doing that we actually would take our 419.5 and 418.78 supplies and would put our new upside resistance and supply at 422.08.\n\nNow we are in extremely weekly momentum so one could expect a bounce off the supply and push higher which would then establish a new demand somewhere in this 417-419 area. However, IF the debt ceiling news shakes the market enough we could see a bigger push down to 414.55 demand or even 410.2 demand (support) to retest that support first. \n\n**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/idw7561f513b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=41368107d769f6f1faf85111a07ef421f408d91f\n\nWhen we look at the daily honestly this pattern of breaking out and rejecting the upside reminds me a lot of April 4th/18th and May 1st/ 19th. This structure actually looks pretty identical to May 18th and 19th. If so then we should see a rejection and actually see a retrace back to at least the daily 8 if not 20ema.\n\nThat gives us a price target of 414.5 to 416.8 for our retrace\u2026\n\nNow in the off chance that we continue to move higher and hold this black bull channel (which support is at 420.3 which means spy has to open green and hold green all day tomorrow)\u2026 if we hold that then our upside target is 425.78. \n\nSPY Daily Levels  \n Supply- 418.78 -> 419.5 -> 429.68  \n Demand- 414.55 -> 410.2  \n Support- 420.2 -> 418.6 -> 417 -> 415.3  \n Resistance- 422.1 -> 425.1\n\n**FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/17crlfif513b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=478e13e629d9a93595a731ffa469877639acaca9\n\nOn Futures it\u2019s the same thing we did not make a new supply and actually the daily DMI on futures shows a little bit more upside to go.\n\nLooking at this until a new supply (resistance) is officially put in this likely is a backtest and bounce off the 4209/4215 supply. However, if a red day is put in tomorrow we likely turn 4240 into a new supply which would take our 4209/4215 and that would then target a breakdown to 4156 and possible 4128 on a bigger sell off. \n\n**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/12vg9uxf513b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf7d088f296407960621afd430e8a34950bae9f3\n\nFutures remains in its black bull channel which has a much more generous support at 4180 for tomorrow and resistance at 4261. A retest of the daily 8ema would give us a bounce near 4200 again tomorrow. \n\nFutures Daily Levels  \n Supply- 4209 -> 4215 -> 4312  \n Demand- 4156 -> 4128  \n Support- 4215 -> 4189 -> 4156  \n Resistance- 4240 -> 4260\n\n**QQQ DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/atnz9ofg513b1.png?width=878&format=png&auto=webp&s=ca5654fe0e539f4a1a549c3fe610790121c71852\n\nNow on QQQ I actually really am looking for a retrace tomorrow\u2026 the daily DMI has hit overbought, and we are nearing a new supply being put in\u2026 we did come up and take our 351.57 demand today also. \n\nIf we put a new supply in tomorrow at 352.68 then our targets would be 347.11 and potentially 337.6 if we see a bigger drop. \n\nHowever, there is a case to be made here if this keeps running that we reach 357.09 and 361.7 demand to take that demand out before we retrace. \n\nHonestly, from a technical stand point QQQ is so over extended it needs a pullback if bulls want any hope at 350-360s\u2026 \n\nThe red bull support sits at 350.7 and resistance at 360 for tomorrow. \n\n**VIX**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y7cjs7tg513b1.png?width=803&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f28d8e180dace0e841bf6ba90c1c9bfdc1a7e1a\n\nNow on the VIX we came within a few pennies of hitting that key 16.92 support before we bounced\u2026 for a while today we attempted to and intended to break back over 17.97 and hold it. However, the EOD push up on SPY was met and led by a nice VIX drop\u2026 this doji here on VIX could with the potential SPY rejection signal a nice upside VIX and downside SPY move tomorrow. \n\nToday was also an anomaly in that the VIX and SPY both closed green today\u2026 \n\n**10YR YIELD and DXY** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t7aday7h513b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e6c776a8c1c537b4a9d5b95a445b547d43160d6\n\nNow one thing that is very interesting to me here is the fact that DXY broke its almost month long bull channel support. However, it is holding that key 103.865 support. But with momentum to the upside breaking on DXY that actually could favor upside on SPY\u2026 the one interesting thing really is the fact that DXY rallied WITH SPY over the last month\u2026 \n\nThe 10YR has the same trend in that it officially broke its uptrend with a rejection off of 3.813%... the key support to watch will be 3.693%.. now with the DXY I cant really wrap my head around why SPY would rally with it and drop with it\u2026 but on 10YR one could say that the 10YR rallying with SPY would be people going RISKY on and then a rejection here would be people going risk off. \n\n**DAILY LOG** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1nepy2lh513b1.png?width=609&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c299f1afad5034994de04bc7e86267ef3f1a468\n\nThis weekend I spent almost a whole half day going through all of my trades over the last month and identifying what was working and what wasn\u2019t working the best\u2026 I came out super excited for my discovery and I did a lot of cleaning up of my charts\u2026 in doing that I actually was able to secure a massive win today\u2026 put in my full weekly profits today\u2026 \u201cMondays\u201d have been extremely great to me so for the last month or so\u2026\n\nI actually really enjoyed trading today\u2026 as you can see there was some struggle in the morning as I kept bitting the recovery that never came (my own fault) and then mid day I struggled with the fake breakdown/ recovery and timing the breakdown\u2026 I definitely got stop loss hunted a few times today but overall a great day of trading mentally and results wise too.", "id": "13w1fwi", "created_utc": 1685479201.0, "score": 97, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 90, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 30, "replies": [{"body": "Nice", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.21154078841209412}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.09356394410133362}, {"body": "Perception is often reality\u2026\n\nAnd Wall St believes Big Tech/AI Tech will outperform the market during the rapidly approaching recession.\n\nProlly a good place to weather the storm.", "score": 21, "replies": [{"body": "When is this rapidly approaching recession coming?
