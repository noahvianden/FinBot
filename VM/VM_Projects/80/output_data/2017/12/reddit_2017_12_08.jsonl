{"title": "Bitcoin Futures and their effect on the price of Bitcoin: Huge Crash? or Huge Boom? Thoughts?", "selftext": "As you all are probably aware, Bitcoin futures contracts are going to start within a matter of days. If you are not aware, please google and get caught up.\n\nHere is my ideas and thoughts, I would like yours. \n\nBitcoin futures contracts are bringing massive amounts of wealth into the bitcoin market. The each contract will be worth 5 BTC EACH. Therefore if BTC hits $20,000/Coin it would put a single option contract at $100,000 per contract. Thats huge.\nHowever, with bitcoin options they are not exercised into buying the actual bitcoin. The transaction is settled with cash, therefore nobody is actually buying or selling bitcoin with bitcoin futures; they are just on the sideline watching and betting on it. \n This does not make sense to me. This is similar to a horse race, you can have millions of people betting on the outcome of the race, but nobody is actually holding back or pulling the horse forward (selling or buying the asset) in order to affect the underlying price. They are just sitting on the sideline, so it makes no sense on why the value of Bitcoin will rise, or crash just because options are introduced.\nNext thing, options contracts are typically filled with pessimistic investors, looking to hedge risk. Typically from what I have read, large institutes like banks and other funds are going to utilize bitcoin futures. \nIf all of the large banks and funds bet against bitcoin on the futures contracts, everyone is expecting that it will have a negative price on the bitcoin market. This does not make sense to me, they are not actually shorting or buying the actual asset, they are just on the sideline. The only way they would force a crash, is if they actually invested in bitcoin, pulled it out at the same time, forcing a crash and manipulating the market at their own free will. \nIn conclusion, I have people saying that Bitcoin will explode in price (up) once options are introduced, and once options go well an ETF will be formed, creating more money in Bitcoin, therefore forcing a new asset class. I also have people saying that Bitcoin will crash in price once options are introduced, because right now large whales and funds are forcing the price up and once options are introduced will pull out therefore creating a market crash and having millions in the pockets of big banks and those very same whales who bought bitcoin.\n\nI don\u2019t have much experience in options, but researching all of this and running different senarios in my head is making my head spin. I know nobody has a crystal ball, but I just want an idea of what this reddit thinks about the whole situation.\n\nWill BTC rise?

It tracks the \"BitMEX Index\" (50% GDAX + 50% Bitstamp spot prices) really well, thanks to the mechanics of the swap.\n\nSo, it is definitely possible for an investor to be long the underlying and sell a futures contract against it, or be short the underlying and buy a futures contract against it.

First, non-delivery contracts are now very common in futures. Entire exchanges, like ICE, feature non-delivery contracts. The daily settlement of non-delivery contracts works independently of the spot Bitcoin market up to the final day of trade. [There is, of course, gradual convergence between futures and spot]. When you enter a futures contract long or short, there is a counter-party (you are long because they agreed to be short). Therefore in EOD settlement, any cash gain is matched by an identical loss in a counter-party cash. This remains true until the final trading day of the contract, when all cash transfers stop. It really has no effect upon the spot market, except to the extent that the spot market \"notices\" what is going in in futures and vice-versa. Any severe price inconsistencies will be corrected almost immediately by arbitrage.\n\nIf large traders bet heavily against futures that will force backwardation ... futures prices will decline going out in time. In such an unlikely scenario these traders will not make a profit until such time as the spot goes below the futures price (NOT just if the spot price goes down).\n\nFor example, assuming BTC is now $15K, if the June futures price goes to $2K, whomever holds that contract short will benefit only if spot drops to BELOW $2K. If spot dropped to $5K, anyone short would lose a massive $3K per unit per contract. This reality is going to hold both contango and backwardation in check.\n\nYour concerns are misplaced.
