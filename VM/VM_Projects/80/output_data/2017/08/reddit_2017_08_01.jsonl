The FedResInk stepped in to do two things:\n\n1 - sequester shill mortgage debt by throwing in under a TARP (the primary and only function of a central bank is to keep debt that it has created intact... that \"dual mandate\" bullshit is just propaganda economists like to tell themselves before they go to sleep each night)\n\nand...\n\n2 - reassure the world that the USA was good for their sovereign debt through the \"open market action\" of buying up all unpurchased treasury debt, allowing the USA's bond auctions to proceed as usual.\n\nAt some point during the eight years after the initial treasury bond auctions failures, the FedResInk stopped having to increase its balance sheet liability by purchasing treasury debt and was able to keep the bond auctions stabilized by rolling existing debt over, which also provided them with the opportunity to dispose of high interest debt and \"twist\" the interest rate down indefinitely to keep the \"bond vigilantes\" at bay while simultaneously providing a mechanism by which Keynesian stimulus of the economy could be exercised.  All during this time, the USA kept raising its debt ceiling and minted more and more debt while revenues fell... because... you know... it could.\n\nNow, as we enter into the end of this particular debt super cycle, there's some question about what happens next.  Two things are certain:\n\n1 - the stock market is over valued via QE inflation and ZIRP.  Here, it's important to understand that the mechanism by which the FedResInk modulates the economy is via interest rates.  Overheated stock market?  Raise interest rates.\n\nHowever....\n\n2 - bonds currently held represent a huge liability (and here, it's important to understand that low(er) interest rate bonds trade at a loss when interest rates go up... effectively a negative interest rate because we're at the \"lower bound\", also known as \"out of ammunition\" or \"pushing a string\")\n\nSo, what we get is a bifurcation where one of two things becomes inevitable:\n\n1 - interest rates are held low forever and the the equity markets are allowed to do what equity markets do (AKA The Japanization Of The American Economy).  Actually what happens is the central bank starts participating directly in the equity markets... nobody is really sure if this has happened yet at the FedResInk, but it has been the de facto outcome due to ZIRP (the FedResInk is inexecrable tied to the equity markets, vis-a-vis \"taper tantrums\" when it tries to adjust policy)\n\nOr...\n\n2 - The debt super cycle is allowed to continue to its logical conclusion, which would involve both the bond market and the stock marking imploding... USA sovereign bond auction failures... an inability to pay anything other than interest on debt already owed... and eventually loss of sovereign bond principal (and, just like Japan, the primary holder of those bonds are Americans via social security which is stuffed to the gills with government debt IOUs).  This culminates with either interest rates required for US debt in the double digits (as happened with Volcker in the 1980s) or the US losing its petrodollar status, at which point the US economy will sink to third or fourth behind China, the EU, and a few other counties... but more than likely one followed by the other in fairly short order.\n\nSeptember is the date the FedResInk has given for the cessation of Treasury debt rollover.  October, the debt ceiling goat rope gets underway in earnest (here its important to know that the sitting POTUS usually get all up in the FedResInk's face to make an increase happen... Treasury is already rifling though their \"crazy drawer\" (their words, not mine... mostly just prioritized payments and a government shutdown) in preperation for this part of the Kabuki.  Some time in 2018, the residential mortgage GSE under writers will need a second bailout.  Treasury's net worth sweeps of these GSEs will cease and ACA will likely implode, taking insurance industry monthly premium float with it.  Real estate will grind to a halt because nobody will underwrite mortgages, a function that is absolutely required to provide liquidity / a callable mortgage.
