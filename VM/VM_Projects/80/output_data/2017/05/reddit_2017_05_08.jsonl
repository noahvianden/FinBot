Therefore, they require less return, going forward. Other risks (like credit risk, liquidity risk, and others) are still priced above the \"natural rate\".\n\nFor VIX, I think the same line of thinking can be used. There was a lot of uncertainty on how the largest 500 companies would perform. As time went on, the market gets **REALLY** good at predicting earnings, dividends, and daily movements. Therefore, there is less uncertainty on the movements of the S&P 500. Since VIX is priced on the \"expected move\" of the S&P 500, the VIX naturally falls as the market can better predict the future movements of the 500 companies.\n\nConsidering that a few companies make up the majority of the S&P 500, and upteen 1000 analysts and retail investors follow these companies, the unpredictability of these companies becomes less, over time.\n\nTLDR: The natural interest rate has trended to 0% and is at like 4%. Looking at the VIX, it looks to be the same. Is the natural level, 10, 12, 14, 16? That is something we don't know.
