{"title": "Bitcoin Depressive Disorder", "selftext": "I first heard about Bitcoin in 2010. I ran in cypherpunk circles and at the time people were using it to avoid the MasterCard ban of Julian Assange. They sent Wikileaks cyber ducats through the Metaverse using fiber optic cable.\n\nI wasn't ignorant- I studied and understood every component of the nascent protocol. However, I chose to go the other way: I ridiculed the Bitcoiners for investing in such an obvious ponzi scheme. It turns out that I am the one who should be ridiculed, because Bitcoin went to the moon and literally never came back.\n\nI missed out of the investment of a lifetime because of pride, and nothing else. I gave up my seat at the table. My chance to become part of the generational change in the wealthy elite has been ruined. What am I going to tell my son when I can't send him to college because the only thing that can keep pace with the rate of inflation in college tuition is Bitcoin?\n\nAnyways, missing out on all those gains has me feeling very depressed. I could have been set for life, but instead I settled for putting my money in a boring 401K and Treasury Bonds.\n\nPlease don't come in here and tell me it's not too late because Bitcoin is going to $1,000,000. I fear my heart may explode if I think any more about my lost opportunity.", "id": "6diqx8", "created_utc": 1495823139.0, "score": 35, "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "num_comments": 75, "comments": [{"body": "Bro you would have sold it all when it hit 10 bucks.
