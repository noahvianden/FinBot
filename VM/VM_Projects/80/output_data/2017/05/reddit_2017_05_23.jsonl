OTM weeklies are simply highly leveraged. They are far cheaper than the alternatives, so while you are much less likely to get ITM, your gains if you get there are hundreds or even thousands of percent returns. I bought OTM puts on AMD when it fell and made over 400% returns. I bought OTM puts on VXX and UVXY last week and made huge gains. OTM options are high risk high reward. \n\n- \"most bullish stock available\"\n\nAnother stupid reason. This stock had multiple booms and busts since earnings. May 11 it hit 130, only to fall to under 126 the next day. May 16 it broke 136.50 only to fall under 128 the next day. \n\nAfter gapping up twice to 139, I felt it was a good entry point to take a short position. I was right, and the stock DID fall, but I chose the wrong approach by shorting with a larger number of cheaper OTM contracts which were vulnerable to a big drop in IV versus a smaller number of more expensive ITM or near ITM contracts.
