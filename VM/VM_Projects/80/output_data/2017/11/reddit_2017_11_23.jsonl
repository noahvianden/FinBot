Let's say he hits his lofty production target of 500K produced by year end 2018. Musk originally said 25% margins and that's looking fake as can be, but let's say he is right. UBS Global Automotives actually believes the production cost with be $41,000 per Tesla which means they lose money, but heck what do they know. \n\nLet's say the average sales price is $40,000 (assuming Musk stays true to his $35,000 price floor). 25% means $10,000 profit per model 3 sale, so a total of 5B profit. 52.5B market cap and currently losing 619M in the last quarter, we are looking at maybe 4.5B of net income for 2018. Again, that is assuming Musk keeps all of his promises and keeps his original production targets (which he has already changed). \n\nIn 2016 GM made 9.5B in net income. \n\nTesla is a great company and might do great things. At this valuation it makes no sense as an investor IMO. Everybody wants to be in on the ground floor of the next Apple but if truly bought every \"next Apple\" company you'd be bankrupt. I'd rather be late to the party than flat out gambling. I don't long or short Tesla because I don't believe or not believe in it, but if I wanted their current valuation to buy my share of losses I'd just light my money on fire. If creditors downgrade them enough for Musk's inability to tell the truth, they are pretty much dead in the water.
