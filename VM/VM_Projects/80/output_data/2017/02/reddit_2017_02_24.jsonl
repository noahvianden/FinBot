If you can buy almost anything you want, you no longer value those items. \n\nIt starts out small, like okay I'll buy this video game and if sucks oh well I'll just give it away or something. Then it gets a little larger like okay if this new phone sucks, I'll just get another one until I find one I like. Next thing you know you're buying a 140k tesla because you no longer enjoy your new Mercedes. Then you buy a 500k house and spend another 500k renovating it because you want it to be better. The whole time you're doing all of this you're never happy that you have any of these things.\n\nI've since learned to enjoy the small things in life that money can't buy, but until I learned that it was just a spiral of depression.

I could travel with my wife whenever/wherever I wanted to and never have to worry about work or deadlines or bosses ever again.

No longer having to worry about money is an amazing feeling. Not having a boss or deadlines to hit etc is an amazing feeling. That in itself will create temporary happiness. After a while though that just becomes the norm and it will no longer make you happy, but just be the way it is. Same with traveling, beach house, boating etc etc, once you can do it any and every day it's no longer as enjoyable. I'm not saying it wont bring you any enjoyment, but it will bring you less enjoyment than it used to. When this happens you start seeking new more enjoyable items, so maybe a speed boat so you can race across the water and use the other boat for fishing. Whatever the scenario is you'll always end up enjoying it less and less. \n\nWhile having a \"real\" job though and working for the man, you don't get to do most of that. Whether it's due to deadlines or money the amount of time you have is limited. So when you take your boat out once or twice a weekend you make the most of it and dream of the days when you no longer have to work and you can do it all the time. Essentially what it boils down to is the dream of a better life usually makes you happier than actually having it come true. I'm in no way saying poor me I have money feel bad for me.

The vacations or boat trips are so enjoyable now because I only get to do it so many times *per year*, yet if I were to do it every day it would lose its luster.
