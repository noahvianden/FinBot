I was pretty much a quasi-value investor clutching \"The Intelligent Investor\" and reciting its wisdom like it was my bible. Looking at P/E ratios in the absolute wrong way. The end result is I didn't make anywhere near as much as I could have and there were times when I was so emotionally shaken from some of the losses I was taking on paper that hours would seem to just disappear at work. It was as if I was in a despondent trance. \n\nWith what I know now, especially in regards to position sizing, I'd have been a millionaire when the smoke cleared. The fact I was sweating $1,000 paper losses on shit like GE on 200 share positions is laughable to me these days, laughable that I even was allowing 5 point losses before cutting and regrouping, but that's the nature of trading I guess. Just hoping future me one day will be able to laugh at present me in the same way for sweating the losses I take these days. Despite that though, I don't think I've ever really psychologically recovered from trading in that environment. It was supposedly one of the worst markets you could see and part of me is always haunted by the possibility that I'll see it again or worse in my life time. Every dip, every correction, every pull back feels like 2008 in my mind. Even when I take a good loss, there is constant caution. It feels like in some ways it never ended.\n\nEdit: You hear how people describe the dotcom boom and bust and they always have this nostalgia to them. \"Oh man, I was making hundreds of thousands trading on my toilet!\" I think that's because the advent of technology then was overwhelming. The world was changing so much that it offset a lot of the horror people were dealing with financially. I don't really encounter any of that with The Financial Crisis. It's always mistrust, disgust, and things like that. Like the Dotcom boom and bust was the girl you were in love with cheating on you. 2007-2008 was her cutting your cock off. \n\nSo for me, pulling the trigger was easy because I was at that magical point of being too dumb to know any better. I didn't really run out of money because again, I was blindly funneling almost all of my money into the market, lived at home, and had a steady income. In the moment, it felt like shit was definitely a matter of \"IF the world recovers...these will be hugely profitable positions...\" That \"if\" was a pretty damn huge \"if.\" You could practically see the \"oh fuck...\" on people's faces.

I had left my first job after getting my graduate degree, and thought, \"in the meantime I'll trade the market, make a few hundred a week and figure out something.\" Ha. I didn't know it was going to be so bad that a company like AT&T couldn't get credit to cover payroll for a week. The market was totally f'd.\n\nSummer 2008 to May 2009 and even into 2010, was unreal. I watched blue chip stocks swing 20% in a day, day after day. Currency pairs whipped around, often crumbling under the vacuum of liquidity as cash was sucked out of the market. To a layman, all the TARP and asset purchase programs sounded like a coin flip. I tried to trade but lost hefty sums. (You'd hear news about a financial company selling bonds--assuming some confidence in that company-- going bankrupt a week later.) At one point I owned 700 shares of $LCC at $2.35 and 400 shares of $JPM at $18. I still managed to lose money on both. \n\nArt Cashin kept warning of a \"tear your face off\" market rally. In the closing minutes, maybe last three minutes of one trading day, the DJI swinged 1500+points to end +1017 for the day . It happened so fast people couldn't even enjoy it. It felt a hell of a lot better than opening \"limit down\" though. \n\nAt some point, the market started to get its feet, but there were so many people on tv who swore up and down that the markets were going to fail and TARP was not nearly enough. They were right. The Fed has to step in and buy trillions in treasuries to unfreeze credit markets.  Even after that, the Eurozone crisis was good for tanking markets every year until Draghi back stopped the EU. That made for some good entry points, though.\n\nIt was an incredible and frightening time. I ruined any opportunity to get rich by betting on a bottom that was still double digit percentage points lower. I talked to more intelligent experienced investors about that time and they made 700%+ in the following year or two by holding basically anything. I still look back and wonder why I watched companies like $LVS at $2 (that ran to $60 two years later) and didn't buy. Could have had any decent company for pennies on the dollar.

After a few years selling iPods and iPhones, they had a serious cash hoard. That was the right buy back then. But I squandered my money on chasing whipsawing financials.
