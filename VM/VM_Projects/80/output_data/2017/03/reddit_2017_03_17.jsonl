Meanwhile Nividia is diversifying into data centers so they dont have to relie on gaming as a major source of revenue, they also got those self driving car bits down the line, while also having better gpus than amd as well.

Since basically every major product launch comes after Ryzen. Vega, Naples and every other deal based on these products. How will Intel \"adjust\" their Xeon prices around Naples? Honestly Intel has nothing on AMD once Naples comes out in terms of pricing. Ryzen has shown to be a downright beast when it comes to workstation tasks, Naples should only improve on this.\n\nNaples will be a beast in price/performance and performance/watt if Ryzen is anything to go after, and Ryzen was just a byproduct of Naples, right? Intel can't just \"adjust\" their pricing to compete with AMD. There's few problems with Ryzen, the biggest is gaming and that's not a problem in the servermarket where Naples and the money is.\n\nWhat are you seeing that I'm not?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "AMDs already unreleased Vega loses to Nvda 1080.

Benchmarks out right now doesn't mean anything, if you mean 1080 already took up all the sales then I believe you're wrong. The 1080 surely gave nvda some remarkable gains considering the prices they have been selling for. With vega as competition less profits will go to nvda and more to amd, unless vega is a bust ofcourse but considering amd has always been equal/better performance/price than nvda I believe vega will do just fine in the consumer market, servermarket on the gpu side I don't know enough about to comment.\n\nIntel lowered their prices on their core lineup somewhat but not nearly enough, but to lower them further then their xeon lineup will be affected and suddenly they'll lose more then just \"some\" gross margin. R7 is on par with intel's broadwell-e lineup at half the price and if naples is successful then intels xeon lineup will have to lower their price by a large amount to be the better product. \n\nThe gpu side of business has been a lot more competitive than the cpu side of business, Intel won't be able to sustain their current pricing without losing the battle. They won't be able to lower their prices enough without taking a big financial hit either. The server market is amd's for the taking since they haven't had anything to offer untill \"now\" with naples. Every sale is a win for amd, and with what we know looking at Ryzen then amd is very much competitive again in a market they left many years ago.\n\nThese cpu's will lead the way for more competitive apu's and combined with a potentially good product called Vega amd could also strike back into the laptop/tablet market which amd also currently lacks in. Amd has for the last years only had the console market and d-gpu market but now they have a chance to get back into all these other markets and claim their profits.\n\nAMD is still tiny in a huge market and 2017-2018 is where they will show if the have what it takes to strike back, I believe they do and that's why I think you're wrong with your claim that next earnings is the last boost to amd.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I like your hope.
