Nokia is just getting royalties for licensing out their name. It's not a matter of whether or not HMD is a quality phone manufacturer (no one is debating this - they are) it's the fact that Nokia only gets a small % from each phone. It's a minor business segment.\n\nIf NOK get's 10% per phone at an average price of $400 per phone and 85million are sold (which is 6% market share, compared to Hauwei's 9%, Samsung's 20%, and Apple's 14%) then that's 3.2 billion. If we add that revenue to last year's total (23.6B) we see that it would have comprised 12% of total revenue. Which is actually quite high when you consider network sales have been down. Change in revenue from network sales will be much larger than change in phone sales. The % will only get smaller unless there is some combination of their phones going to the moon and their network business nose diving (which would be very, very bad for NOK).\n\nIt's a nice new revenue stream.
