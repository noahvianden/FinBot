Emerging markets will improve road infrastructure drastically over the next 20 years and cars will become much more affordable to them, likely doubling the global car fleet.\n\nAnd autonomous driving is the future way more than EVs. Tesla is ranked at the bottom in the autonomous vehicle race (despite all the marketing hype) and Ford is ranked near the top. The future is autonomous taxi fleets - less people will need to own cars for city driving (which is bad for Tesla since less personal ownership means their brand won't be as valuable) - and what technology is better for autonomous taxi's? Quite possibly hybrid technology. Battery degradation, large weight/volume, and long refueling times are ways that EVs could easily lose out for non-personal transport. Hybdrids are only 3x the fuel cost right now of an EV, and with more EVs needing to be charged daily, the cost of electricity will increase reducing that advantage. And hybrid technology is only going to get more fuel efficient.\n\nSo Ford could absolutely go to Mars. And Tesla could be a stinker.
