Her advice to me was to 'buy AMZN' because it went up $50 recently after she bought some shares, so now she is going to buy more.  When I suggested she hedge her portfolio with bonds, considering she is 75, she said it is too complicated and she doesn't understand all that.  She just knows her friend bought the dip in 2009 and did great.\n\nHow do I convince this bitch she is about to lose it all?  She listens to people she respects, like Gwyneth Paltrow and not me.
