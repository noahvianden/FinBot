{"title": "Is there literally any reason not to short semiconductors right now? I will eat a lemon if NVDA goes above 100 this week.", "selftext": "The markets are going to be down. French election, North Korea, blah blah chaos blah blah market is overpriced.\n\nThis being the case, what sectors are the most overbought? NVDA, AMD, and MU saw absolutely batshit run-ups in 2016. The technicals suggest NVDA is barely holding onto support at $95 and will hit major resistance at $100. This being the case, is there literally any reason whatsoever to not sell weekly calls for a $100 strike? I literally cannot think of one, since there is absolutely zero scenario in which that trade doesn't end up being profitable.\n\nAlso, I'm sorry if you didn't get in on AMD until it hit $14 (this sub has been pumping that shit since it was below $2.00), but along with NVDA it is massively overpriced. Institutions are taking profits and dumping the whole semiconductor sector in search of better value plays.\n\nTL;DR I will live stream myself eating a whole lemon, rind and all, if NVDA goes above 100.
