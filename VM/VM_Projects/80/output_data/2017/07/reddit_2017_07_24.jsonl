{"title": "The time to play this week's earnings was two weeks ago, so let's get a jump on things by looking ahead to two weeks from now.", "selftext": "Last week, $MSFT was flat on a beat after a 10% run-up in the two weeks preceding the report.  $V was flat after a 7% run-up to earnings.  This week, $AMD is up 3.5% this morning for the report tomorrow.  If you're trying to play earnings the week of, *you're gonna have a bad time.*  (Mmmkay?)  So, with that in mind, here are a few notable earnings reports for the next 7-15 business days.  I probably didn't list everything you're interested in, but you can find more if you look around.\n\nNotes:\n\n* These are **officially scheduled** earnings reports.  For example, $NVDA & $BABA are *estimated* to report on 8/10, but we don't yet know if it's AM or PM.  I would highly recommend looking through the \"estimated\" section of the earnings calendar via the links below.\n\n* Several of the highest holdings in everyone's favorite leveraged junior gold miners index fund report the week of Monday, 8/07.  I've listed $IAG, which is the largest holding, but expect larger than usual volatility (if such a thing is even possible).\n\n* Hospitality has a big week coming up, with Marriott, InterContinental (Holiday Inn), Starwood, and most of the major players reporting on 8/08 or 8/09.\n\n\nCompany | Ticker | Date | Time\n:--|--|--:|--\n[Activision Blizzard, Inc](http://www.nasdaq.com/earnings/report/atvi) | $ATVI | Thu 8/03 | PM\n[Aetna, Inc](http://www.nasdaq.com/earnings/report/aet) | $AET | Thu 8/03 | AM\n[Cable One, Inc](http://www.nasdaq.com/earnings/report/cabo) | $CABO | Tue 8/08 | AM\n[Caesars Entertainment Corporation](http://www.nasdaq.com/earnings/report/cxr) | $CZR | Thu 8/03 | PM\n[Chesapeake Energy Corporation](http://www.nasdaq.com/earnings/report/chk) | $CHK | Thu 8/03 | AM\n[CVS Health Corporation](http://www.nasdaq.com/earnings/report/cvs) | $CVS | Tue 8/08 | AM\n[Etsy, Inc](http://www.nasdaq.com/earnings/report/etsy) | $ETSY | Thu 8/03 | PM\n[GoDaddy, Inc](http://www.nasdaq.com/earnings/report/gddy) | $GDDY | Tue 8/08 | PM\n[GrubHub, Inc](http://www.nasdaq.com/earnings/report/grub) | $GRUB | Thu 8/03 | PM\n[Hertz Global Holdings, Inc](http://www.nasdaq.com/earnings/report/htz) | $HTZ | Tue 8/08 | PM\n[Hostess Brands, Inc](http://www.nasdaq.com/earnings/report/twnk) | $TWNK | Tue 8/08 | PM\n[Iamgold Corporation](http://www.nasdaq.com/earnings/report/iag) | $IAG | Wed 8/09 | PM\n[Intercontinental Hotels Group](http://www.nasdaq.com/earnings/report/ihg) | $IHG | Tue 8/08 | AM\n[Kohl's Corporation](http://www.nasdaq.com/earnings/report/kss) | $KSS | Thu 8/10 | AM\n[Marriott International](http://www.nasdaq.com/earnings/report/mar) | $MAR | Tue 8/08 | PM\n[Michael Kors Holdings Limited](http://www.nasdaq.com/earnings/report/kors) | $KORS | Tue 8/08 | AM\n[National Health Investors, Inc](http://www.nasdaq.com/earnings/report/nhi) | $NHI | Wed 8/09 | AM\n[News Corporation](http://www.nasdaq.com/earnings/report/nws) | $NWS | Thu 8/10 | PM\n[Nordstrom, Inc](http://www.nasdaq.com/earnings/report/jwn) | $JWN | Thu 8/10 | PM\n[Ralph Lauren, Inc](http://www.nasdaq.com/earnings/report/rl) | $RL | Tue 8/08 | AM\n[Snap, Inc](http://www.nasdaq.com/earnings/report/snap) | $SNAP | Thu 8/10 | PM\n[Sotheby's](http://www.nasdaq.com/earnings/report/bid) | $BID | Thu 8/03 | AM\n[Starwood Property Trust, Inc](http://www.nasdaq.com/earnings/report/stwd) | $STWD | Wed 8/09 | AM\n[Sun Life Financial, Inc](http://www.nasdaq.com/earnings/report/slf) | $SLF | Wed 8/09 | PM\n[Twilio, Inc](http://www.nasdaq.com/earnings/report/twlo) | $TWLO | Mon 8/07 | PM\n[Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc](http://www.nasdaq.com/earnings/report/vrx) | $VRX | Tue 8/08 | AM\n[Walt Disney Company](http://www.nasdaq.com/earnings/report/dis) | $DIS | Tue 8/08 | PM\n", "id": "6p90yf", "created_utc": 1500909429.0, "score": 181, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 82, "comments": [{"body": "$CVS calls.
