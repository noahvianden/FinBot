And over the next 12 months it erases the bearish moment entirely with another 7% gain.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "not that simple. 25,000 * 1.07 (7% gains) = 26,750; 26,750 * 0.9 = 24,075; whereas simply 25,000 * 0.97 = 24,250. and that's not that simple either, because of compounding percentages over time.", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "You can go a bit deeper when you make a few assumptions, say for example that the number of months (X) until a crash is a random variable with uniform probability over the next 24 months p(X=x) = 1/24. Then the principal multiplier would be f(x) = c(1+r)^x where r is the monthly rate of return and c is the percent of money left after a crash (for example c = 0.9 for a 10% drop and r=0.00565 to get a monthly compounding rate equivalent to 7% a year). By \"principal multiplier\" I mean you multiply this number by the amount invested to see what you would have after, so above 1 are gains, below 1 are losses.\n\nThen you can calculate the expected principal multiplier of continuing to invest with E[f(x)] = integral f(x) p(x) dx from 0 to 24. If you want to generalize to \"a crash within m months\" then this is an integral from 0 to m, and the definite integral after the calculus ends up being c((1+r)^m - 1) / (m ln(1+ r)).\n\nSo for example, given the parameters assumed by RalphWiggum4 (c = 0.9, r = 0.00565, m = 24), the expected investment multiplier would be 0.96373, meaning you would expect to lose almost 4% if you stay invested with these assumptions.
