Obviously this market is insane, so, I could be right and the stock still go down, or you could be right and the stock still goes up, but, here's some rebuttals:\n\n1. I won't argue with you there.  We've seen a 9% jump since FDX earnings.  That's respectable and does mean a solid earnings is priced in.  I got in on all my calls at average stock price of $114, so, I'm up going into earnings even after a little theta decay.  Little cushion.\n2. a. Here is where I kind of think you're going off the rails.  During the period of this report (Apr-May-June) the type of business that UPS is doing hasn't really changed.  People use UPS to ship heavy parcels that aren't time sensitive.  Guess what?  That describes a lot of the current demand in the market.  They've been leveraging their existing network - which is EXACTLY SET UP for this pandemic - to cheaply deliver heavy parcels across the USA.  When you're buying household goods bigger than a shoebox - UPS is who is typically going to be delivering that stuff.  So, their customers haven't changed, and the types of parcels haven't changed.  What has changed is that volumes are +60% YOY.  They didn't need to pivot, or re-align resources, they just had to pay out a few overtime hours to their drivers.    In fact, FDX earnings jump was BECAUSE of ground increases.  And ground isn't even their bread and butter!  FDX inefficiently subcontracts all of their ground.  With respect to your Amazon argument - it is true that those parcels aren't necessarily going to increase their EPS - but what it will do is bolster their top line revenue, and that's important to people in this market right now.  They want companies that are growing their top line.b.  Claiming that UPS will do bad because FedEx has more planes, honestly, is silly.  FedEx specializes in expedited delivery.  They need planes.  UPS has only been pushing their 2-day services in the past few years to try to take market share away from FedEx - that was their growth strategy.  It has never been their focus, however.  And honestly, right now?  Not dumping money trying to get 2-day business when they can leverage existing network was the MOST PROFITABLE thing they could have done.  Their focus has always been their ground network.  There is room for BOTH of these companies to reach and continue past their 52 week highs.  With USPS dropping the ball over the last few months, business will flow into both of their networks (Priority Mail --> FedEx 2Day, and heavier parcels --> UPS).  the only TRUE threat to UPS and FedEx would be if Amazon opened up their delivery network to the public and businesses to ship through their logistics.  And the framework and support network is many years out for that to be a real threat at this point.\n3. UPS P/E is similar to FDX at this current moment, but, when you compare them to S&P average (27) and the fact that multiples don't even fucking matter anymore, I don't think some significant movement is completely off the table.\n\nI have several friends/acquaintances that work for UPS - 2-3 drivers, some package handlers, pilots, and the story is all the same.  They're doing record volume.In the end, right now, there are a lot of conservative investors out there that are looking for safe places to park money.  They could very well look at  UPS earnings as proof that the stock is a covid-safe play - and if guidance/outlook is positive, it could prove to many that UPS is a solid, low risk investment that's paying \\~3.3% dividends.  Try getting that from your bank.\n\nUPS isn't a meme stock, it's true.  But, it doesn't need to be to see a bump on Thursday.  And if some of this autistic retail investor segment takes notice of a bump - it could REALLY do well because I can guarantee you right now, Robinhood traders don't fucking currently own UPS.   I think it will get just enough attention Thursday morning to make a move to the upside.  My price target is $127.  I don't think this is a 10-bagger, but, if you're looking to minimize potential downside (-20%) with a fairly good potential for 70-100% gains, I think it's a good play.  And for the love of god, sell your calls within a week because any Robinhooders that do buy UPS will get bored as fuck within 2 weeks of earnings and you'll probably see it slowly go down.", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "I would also add:\n\n\\- EPS are calculated like a shitty Q2 2019, whereas given the boost in B2C and recovery in B2B it should really be priced like a shitty Q4 2019: christmas-level activity with lower operating margin.\n\n\\- Fedex specializes in air, but ground has always been where UPS reigns supreme, with better logistics and synergies (shared IT and infrastructures for all 3 branches - whereas FDX uses separates on express, air and ground - and larger truck fleet/workforce). This makes them better suited to gain from the B2C spike thanks to superior operational margin in the ground branch.\n\n\\- The company has a new CEO, whom was \"given\" 100,000 RSU expiring in 2030: she really doesn't want to be sacked now. She also bought 10,000 shares at 99$ a pop last month, which further my sentiment she will provide positive guidance to avoid board members backlash.\n\n\\- Strictly NO insider selling for the past 3 months despite a 30% stock rally according to SEC 4 fillings.

{"title": "Uranium (U308) and Uranium Mining: - Potential 10-15x Return", "selftext": "Quick background: I've been at a L/S hedge fund for six years. Built my net worth and career by finding substantially mispriced asymmetric investments/trades.\n\nThe uranium mining trade is the most asymmetric investment I've come across in my career. The best way to play it is through $CCJ 1/22 Calls. 10-15x+ upside if thesis plays out with strikes  30%+ OTM.\n\nUranium (U308) is the top performing commodity of 2020. +33% YTD. ([https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-17/top-commodity-performer-uranium-gains-even-with-energy-use-weak?sref=FJe64ymv](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-17/top-commodity-performer-uranium-gains-even-with-energy-use-weak?sref=FJe64ymv) )\n\nThe party is just getting started.\n\n**The industry has been in the shit house since the 2011 Fukushima disaster in Japan. Prices went from $70+/lb in 2011 to \\~$33/lb today. They were around $120-130/lb in 2007.**\n\nUranium is used for nuclear power generation. 20% of US power and 10% of global power comes from nuclear. Demand for nuclear power is growing \\~2%/yr, mostly driven by China. China thinks with 10+ year time horizon. Demand for nuclear power not impacted by COVID-19 ([https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-energy-nuclear/china-says-virus-outbreak-will-not-impact-nuclear-power-plant-construction-idUSKCN21X0B4](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-energy-nuclear/china-says-virus-outbreak-will-not-impact-nuclear-power-plant-construction-idUSKCN21X0B4)).\n\nThis is a supply story. Mining at today\u2019s prices is uneconomical. **From 2017-2018, mine closures due to unprofitable production led to 25% of global uranium supply being shut down, including the world's largest uranium mine (McArthur River).** Imagine what would happen to the price of oil if 25% of global oil supply was taken offline.\n\nSo why didn't the supply cuts lead to a higher uranium prices?\n\nThe market was still oversupplied after Fukushima. Japan was 12% of global uranium demand and shut down all their reactors post-2011. There was still an excess of supply in the spot market.\n\nFor nuclear power plants, running out of fuel is not an option. And Utilities can\u2019t just put uranium from a mine into their reactors \u2013 there are a lot of steps in between. The nuclear fuel cycle takes 18 -24 months. Nuclear power utilities typically enter into long-term 8-10 year contracts to ensure security of supply.\n\nMany nuclear power utilities locked into long-term contracts for uranium at the peak of the prior bull market in 2011. Those contracts are now entering a roll-off phase. **40% of utility demand is uncovered in 2020 and over 80% is uncovered by 2025** **(source: UxC).**\n\nSo why is the uranium price +33% YTD?\n\nDue to COVID-19, Kazatomprom, the largest uranium producer, announced in April it was reducing activities at its uranium mines for three months. Meanwhile, Cameco ($CCJ), the #2 largest uranium miner in the world, halted production at their Cigar Lake mine in Canada, the world\u2019s largest producing mine, then extended the suspension for an \u201cindeterminate\u201d period on April 13. **All told, the shutdowns wiped out about 35% of annual mined global uranium output.**\n\nThe excess post-Fukishima material has finally worked its way out of the market and utilities are waking up to how tight the market really is (hence +30% rally in March). **The cash costs to produce uranium are about $25-$30 per pound and the all-in sustaining cost when you add exploratory capex, royalties etc., is near $50-$60 per pound.**\n\nThe next uranium contracting cycle is upon us, and prices will need to rise materially to incentivize new production. The best way to play this IMO is through $CCJ 1/22 Calls 30-50%+ OTM. CCJ is easily a $30+ stock at $50-$60/lb uranium (based on free cash flow, I have a model). Calls have 10-15x+ upside.\n\nWhy the long dated calls?\n\nOption math works a lot better over short intervals. Once you extend the time horizon, all sorts of exogenous variables can throw a wrench into option-pricing models.\n\nRemember, a key assumption of black-scholes is that daily stock price changes are independent of the prior days\u2014i.e. trends are not predictable and daily changes in stock prices reflect no memory of prior days; there is no price reflexivity.\n\nThe longer the time period, the greater the potential for a trend, and hence the greater the chance that a longer-term price move will exceed the standard deviation implied probability, which increases only by the square root of time.\n\nA lot more I could add about the industry/$CCJ but that's enough for now.

Obviously this market is insane, so, I could be right and the stock still go down, or you could be right and the stock still goes up, but, here's some rebuttals:\n\n1. I won't argue with you there.  We've seen a 9% jump since FDX earnings.  That's respectable and does mean a solid earnings is priced in.  I got in on all my calls at average stock price of $114, so, I'm up going into earnings even after a little theta decay.  Little cushion.\n2. a. Here is where I kind of think you're going off the rails.  During the period of this report (Apr-May-June) the type of business that UPS is doing hasn't really changed.  People use UPS to ship heavy parcels that aren't time sensitive.  Guess what?  That describes a lot of the current demand in the market.  They've been leveraging their existing network - which is EXACTLY SET UP for this pandemic - to cheaply deliver heavy parcels across the USA.  When you're buying household goods bigger than a shoebox - UPS is who is typically going to be delivering that stuff.  So, their customers haven't changed, and the types of parcels haven't changed.  What has changed is that volumes are +60% YOY.  They didn't need to pivot, or re-align resources, they just had to pay out a few overtime hours to their drivers.    In fact, FDX earnings jump was BECAUSE of ground increases.  And ground isn't even their bread and butter!  FDX inefficiently subcontracts all of their ground.  With respect to your Amazon argument - it is true that those parcels aren't necessarily going to increase their EPS - but what it will do is bolster their top line revenue, and that's important to people in this market right now.  They want companies that are growing their top line.b.  Claiming that UPS will do bad because FedEx has more planes, honestly, is silly.  FedEx specializes in expedited delivery.  They need planes.  UPS has only been pushing their 2-day services in the past few years to try to take market share away from FedEx - that was their growth strategy.  It has never been their focus, however.  And honestly, right now?  Not dumping money trying to get 2-day business when they can leverage existing network was the MOST PROFITABLE thing they could have done.  Their focus has always been their ground network.  There is room for BOTH of these companies to reach and continue past their 52 week highs.  With USPS dropping the ball over the last few months, business will flow into both of their networks (Priority Mail --> FedEx 2Day, and heavier parcels --> UPS).  the only TRUE threat to UPS and FedEx would be if Amazon opened up their delivery network to the public and businesses to ship through their logistics.  And the framework and support network is many years out for that to be a real threat at this point.\n3. UPS P/E is similar to FDX at this current moment, but, when you compare them to S&P average (27) and the fact that multiples don't even fucking matter anymore, I don't think some significant movement is completely off the table.\n\nI have several friends/acquaintances that work for UPS - 2-3 drivers, some package handlers, pilots, and the story is all the same.  They're doing record volume.In the end, right now, there are a lot of conservative investors out there that are looking for safe places to park money.  They could very well look at  UPS earnings as proof that the stock is a covid-safe play - and if guidance/outlook is positive, it could prove to many that UPS is a solid, low risk investment that's paying \\~3.3% dividends.  Try getting that from your bank.\n\nUPS isn't a meme stock, it's true.  But, it doesn't need to be to see a bump on Thursday.  And if some of this autistic retail investor segment takes notice of a bump - it could REALLY do well because I can guarantee you right now, Robinhood traders don't fucking currently own UPS.   I think it will get just enough attention Thursday morning to make a move to the upside.  My price target is $127.  I don't think this is a 10-bagger, but, if you're looking to minimize potential downside (-20%) with a fairly good potential for 70-100% gains, I think it's a good play.  And for the love of god, sell your calls within a week because any Robinhooders that do buy UPS will get bored as fuck within 2 weeks of earnings and you'll probably see it slowly go down.", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "I would also add:\n\n\\- EPS are calculated like a shitty Q2 2019, whereas given the boost in B2C and recovery in B2B it should really be priced like a shitty Q4 2019: christmas-level activity with lower operating margin.\n\n\\- Fedex specializes in air, but ground has always been where UPS reigns supreme, with better logistics and synergies (shared IT and infrastructures for all 3 branches - whereas FDX uses separates on express, air and ground - and larger truck fleet/workforce). This makes them better suited to gain from the B2C spike thanks to superior operational margin in the ground branch.\n\n\\- The company has a new CEO, whom was \"given\" 100,000 RSU expiring in 2030: she really doesn't want to be sacked now. She also bought 10,000 shares at 99$ a pop last month, which further my sentiment she will provide positive guidance to avoid board members backlash.\n\n\\- Strictly NO insider selling for the past 3 months despite a 30% stock rally according to SEC 4 fillings.

{"title": "Uranium (U308) and Uranium Mining: - Potential 10-15x Return", "selftext": "Quick background: I've been at a L/S hedge fund for six years. Built my net worth and career by finding substantially mispriced asymmetric investments/trades.\n\nThe uranium mining trade is the most asymmetric investment I've come across in my career. The best way to play it is through $CCJ 1/22 Calls. 10-15x+ upside if thesis plays out with strikes  30%+ OTM.\n\nUranium (U308) is the top performing commodity of 2020. +33% YTD. ([https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-17/top-commodity-performer-uranium-gains-even-with-energy-use-weak?sref=FJe64ymv](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-17/top-commodity-performer-uranium-gains-even-with-energy-use-weak?sref=FJe64ymv) )\n\nThe party is just getting started.\n\n**The industry has been in the shit house since the 2011 Fukushima disaster in Japan. Prices went from $70+/lb in 2011 to \\~$33/lb today. They were around $120-130/lb in 2007.**\n\nUranium is used for nuclear power generation. 20% of US power and 10% of global power comes from nuclear. Demand for nuclear power is growing \\~2%/yr, mostly driven by China. China thinks with 10+ year time horizon. Demand for nuclear power not impacted by COVID-19 ([https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-energy-nuclear/china-says-virus-outbreak-will-not-impact-nuclear-power-plant-construction-idUSKCN21X0B4](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-energy-nuclear/china-says-virus-outbreak-will-not-impact-nuclear-power-plant-construction-idUSKCN21X0B4)).\n\nThis is a supply story. Mining at today\u2019s prices is uneconomical. **From 2017-2018, mine closures due to unprofitable production led to 25% of global uranium supply being shut down, including the world's largest uranium mine (McArthur River).** Imagine what would happen to the price of oil if 25% of global oil supply was taken offline.\n\nSo why didn't the supply cuts lead to a higher uranium prices?\n\nThe market was still oversupplied after Fukushima. Japan was 12% of global uranium demand and shut down all their reactors post-2011. There was still an excess of supply in the spot market.\n\nFor nuclear power plants, running out of fuel is not an option. And Utilities can\u2019t just put uranium from a mine into their reactors \u2013 there are a lot of steps in between. The nuclear fuel cycle takes 18 -24 months. Nuclear power utilities typically enter into long-term 8-10 year contracts to ensure security of supply.\n\nMany nuclear power utilities locked into long-term contracts for uranium at the peak of the prior bull market in 2011. Those contracts are now entering a roll-off phase. **40% of utility demand is uncovered in 2020 and over 80% is uncovered by 2025** **(source: UxC).**\n\nSo why is the uranium price +33% YTD?\n\nDue to COVID-19, Kazatomprom, the largest uranium producer, announced in April it was reducing activities at its uranium mines for three months. Meanwhile, Cameco ($CCJ), the #2 largest uranium miner in the world, halted production at their Cigar Lake mine in Canada, the world\u2019s largest producing mine, then extended the suspension for an \u201cindeterminate\u201d period on April 13. **All told, the shutdowns wiped out about 35% of annual mined global uranium output.**\n\nThe excess post-Fukishima material has finally worked its way out of the market and utilities are waking up to how tight the market really is (hence +30% rally in March). **The cash costs to produce uranium are about $25-$30 per pound and the all-in sustaining cost when you add exploratory capex, royalties etc., is near $50-$60 per pound.**\n\nThe next uranium contracting cycle is upon us, and prices will need to rise materially to incentivize new production. The best way to play this IMO is through $CCJ 1/22 Calls 30-50%+ OTM. CCJ is easily a $30+ stock at $50-$60/lb uranium (based on free cash flow, I have a model). Calls have 10-15x+ upside.\n\nWhy the long dated calls?\n\nOption math works a lot better over short intervals. Once you extend the time horizon, all sorts of exogenous variables can throw a wrench into option-pricing models.\n\nRemember, a key assumption of black-scholes is that daily stock price changes are independent of the prior days\u2014i.e. trends are not predictable and daily changes in stock prices reflect no memory of prior days; there is no price reflexivity.\n\nThe longer the time period, the greater the potential for a trend, and hence the greater the chance that a longer-term price move will exceed the standard deviation implied probability, which increases only by the square root of time.\n\nA lot more I could add about the industry/$CCJ but that's enough for now.
