{"title": "Learn from my mistake. Greed/cockiness and stupidity has caused a stressful week", "selftext": "Hey my favorite sub reddit. Hope you all are having a better week than me! I am a little stressed right now. I should have listened to you all.\n\nFor the last 4 weeks, I switched from selling straight naked puts to OTM put credit spreads on high dollar value stocks like; SHOP, GOOG, AMZN. I would have just sold naked on these stocks if I could, as, I love them all and would have no fear of holding them but you need a pretty damn large account to take assignment of stocks worth over $1000-$3000.\n\nIt was like free money these past 4 weeks selling 4-5% OTM put credit spreads on these high dollar tech companies. And, I started selling weeklies (which I never used to do, always stuck to 45 days out but I figured tech only had so much further to run and thought I was being safer betting that these stocks won't drop 4% in a week rather than a month and a half) I literally made well over 20k Canadian just off those 3 tickers in 4 trading weeks all from spreads\n\nAt first I would close these spreads out at 50% profit. Then, I realized they always would end up expiring way OTM and I got mad I was \"leaving so much money on the table\" so I started riding them to expiry.\n\nI had sucha good 4 weeks, on Friday I opened up wayyy more spreads on SHOP,AMZN and GOOG than I would be O.K. with losing because I got over confident. I could have closed them all out on Monday when they ALL hit 52 week highs but 40-50% over a weekend returns were not enough for my greedy ass\n\nThere is still a good chance at least some of these spreads will be winners. I may get lucky and all of them are BUT, I may be in for a massive loss that will wipe up all my last months gains. I have accepted it and am staying positive as I have plenty of cash on the sides and will be able to make it back. This has been a very humbling learning experience. I am going to be MUCH safer after this, even if I end up somehow coming out ok on all of these\n\nI wanted to make this post to state not only the obvious, which, is only create spreads that if you end up needing to take a loss, it won't hurt and the second one\n\nDO  NOT OPEN ALL YOUR SPREADS IN ONE SECTOR. I had been only sticking to 3 or 4 big name tech stocks because they were the \"safe havens\" I knew it would not last forever and I still risked it. I thought \"one more week and I am done with these weeklies and going back to naked puts\"\n\nI hate spreads because you cannot roll them unless you take on even more risk by widening the strikes. Puts are SO easy to roll for a credit and each time you roll it brings your cost basis down. I may roll some of these for a debit if I have to as I do believe they will rise, esp as earnings approaches but I am not going to take on more risk by widening the strikes\n\nI do not think tech is dead, but, it is strange how much it is lagging. I thought with Covid getting worse, people would be rushing to the \"safe haven\" stocks more but seems value is the winner lately\n\nTLDR: Do not get cocky and sell tons of spreads without asking yourself if you lose on every single one, can you stomach that loss? #2, do not sell all your spreads/puts in the same sector. #3 do not sell weeklies\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: It is Thursday night and it looks like I am nicely fucked. SHOP plummeted, AMZN too. I just lost all my gains plus several thousand more from the YEAR in one WEEK. I used to laugh when I saw stories like mine on WSB. Like, some guy was up 1million and is now in the red,\n\nNow, I understand. Greed is real.

{"title": "Learn from my mistake. Greed/cockiness and stupidity has caused a stressful week", "selftext": "Hey my favorite sub reddit. Hope you all are having a better week than me! I am a little stressed right now. I should have listened to you all.\n\nFor the last 4 weeks, I switched from selling straight naked puts to OTM put credit spreads on high dollar value stocks like; SHOP, GOOG, AMZN. I would have just sold naked on these stocks if I could, as, I love them all and would have no fear of holding them but you need a pretty damn large account to take assignment of stocks worth over $1000-$3000.\n\nIt was like free money these past 4 weeks selling 4-5% OTM put credit spreads on these high dollar tech companies. And, I started selling weeklies (which I never used to do, always stuck to 45 days out but I figured tech only had so much further to run and thought I was being safer betting that these stocks won't drop 4% in a week rather than a month and a half) I literally made well over 20k Canadian just off those 3 tickers in 4 trading weeks all from spreads\n\nAt first I would close these spreads out at 50% profit. Then, I realized they always would end up expiring way OTM and I got mad I was \"leaving so much money on the table\" so I started riding them to expiry.\n\nI had sucha good 4 weeks, on Friday I opened up wayyy more spreads on SHOP,AMZN and GOOG than I would be O.K. with losing because I got over confident. I could have closed them all out on Monday when they ALL hit 52 week highs but 40-50% over a weekend returns were not enough for my greedy ass\n\nThere is still a good chance at least some of these spreads will be winners. I may get lucky and all of them are BUT, I may be in for a massive loss that will wipe up all my last months gains. I have accepted it and am staying positive as I have plenty of cash on the sides and will be able to make it back. This has been a very humbling learning experience. I am going to be MUCH safer after this, even if I end up somehow coming out ok on all of these\n\nI wanted to make this post to state not only the obvious, which, is only create spreads that if you end up needing to take a loss, it won't hurt and the second one\n\nDO  NOT OPEN ALL YOUR SPREADS IN ONE SECTOR. I had been only sticking to 3 or 4 big name tech stocks because they were the \"safe havens\" I knew it would not last forever and I still risked it. I thought \"one more week and I am done with these weeklies and going back to naked puts\"\n\nI hate spreads because you cannot roll them unless you take on even more risk by widening the strikes. Puts are SO easy to roll for a credit and each time you roll it brings your cost basis down. I may roll some of these for a debit if I have to as I do believe they will rise, esp as earnings approaches but I am not going to take on more risk by widening the strikes\n\nI do not think tech is dead, but, it is strange how much it is lagging. I thought with Covid getting worse, people would be rushing to the \"safe haven\" stocks more but seems value is the winner lately\n\nTLDR: Do not get cocky and sell tons of spreads without asking yourself if you lose on every single one, can you stomach that loss? #2, do not sell all your spreads/puts in the same sector. #3 do not sell weeklies\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: It is Thursday night and it looks like I am nicely fucked. SHOP plummeted, AMZN too. I just lost all my gains plus several thousand more from the YEAR in one WEEK. I used to laugh when I saw stories like mine on WSB.
