That's not part of your job description and your clients aren't wanting that from you.  Your only job is to make their money do what the s&p does.

You aren't paid to try to beat the market and buy stocks cheaply that you suspect are gonna go up.\n\nAnother way to think about it: Tesla is very volatile.  We all know this.  Some would even still call this a bubble.

Now challenge the market to price that in.  Ok.  The market pushes up the share price to $1500 all on the back of inclusion.  However, it cannot sustain this price level for very long due to lack of demand at $1500.  Inclusion then officially occurs, and index funds step in to buy.  They perfectly fill the gap of buyers needed to sustain the $1500 price.
