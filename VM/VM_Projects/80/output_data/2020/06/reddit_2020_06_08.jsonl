{"title": "Mall REIT Update: Another big rally today, window for entry is shrinking, many up AH's.", "selftext": "The (big) Mall rally ***continues*** despite crazy people saying otherwise and saying the malls are dead for almost 2 months now. Bears aren't supposed to be hunting during winter, they are supposed to hibernate or they starve. Poor starving bears.\n\n**Here are today's big mall rally standings** ***as of 4:15 PM EST***:\n\n \n\n1. **$ M AC: up 17.65%!**\n2. **$ SKT: up 10.33%!**\n3. **$ SPG: up 7.79%!**\n4. **$ SITC: up 7.25%!**\n5. **$ REG: up 5.71%!**\n6. **$ KIM: up 3.09%!**\n7. **$ KRG: up 2.38%!**\n\n(Extra: **WRI: up 3.66%!)**\n\n**(BONUS) Below are some C-Tier class malls that did well today:**\n\n1. **$ WPG: up 49.09%**\n2. **$ PEI: up 28.14%**\n3. **$ CDR: up 21.77%**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor the bigger malls the costs are starting to go up so the cheap window to entry is closing. I'd say you have tomorrow to jump in before the costs start becoming more expensive on average for most of them. This rally will be going on until July.\n\nDon't panic and sell hold on as the climbing continues, some people earlier in premarket and at open today panic sold, some at marginal profits (why?) and missed the jump up, just hold on and be patient, get a July or August strike exp options.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**For reference here are all the DD' I made on the mall reits in chronological order:**\n\n**DD 1:**  [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gfwp8q/many\\_of\\_you\\_guys\\_are\\_making\\_a\\_yuge\\_mistake\\_dont/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gfwp8q/many_of_you_guys_are_making_a_yuge_mistake_dont/) \n\n**DD 2:**\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gm48ln/large\\_mall\\_stocks\\_are\\_skyrocketing\\_today\\_with\\_no/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gm48ln/large_mall_stocks_are_skyrocketing_today_with_no/)\n\n**DD 3:** [**https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gvwxvt/reit\\_dd\\_i\\_warned\\_yall\\_previously\\_that\\_you/**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gvwxvt/reit_dd_i_warned_yall_previously_that_you/)\n\n**DD 4:**\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gxjlzi/mall\\_reit\\_dds\\_revenge\\_i\\_told\\_yall\\_not\\_to\\_mess/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gxjlzi/mall_reit_dds_revenge_i_told_yall_not_to_mess/)\n\n**DD 5:** [**https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gy12oi/video\\_dd\\_two\\_malls\\_with\\_increasing\\_foot\\_traffic/**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gy12oi/video_dd_two_malls_with_increasing_foot_traffic/)", "id": "gz7jkg", "created_utc": 1591648750.0, "score": 56, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 90, "comments": [{"body": "> Bears aren't supposed to be hunting during winter, they are supposed to hibernate or they starve.
