As a lifelong Disney World fan, I know there was a lot of love behind Iger. Eisner kinda transformed the parks and pulled it into the modern age and was very much responsible for making the parks \"movies\" with different scenes. He pushed the whole immersive theming.\n\nIger was best known for creating Walt Disney the company. He took it from a theme park-centric company and built it into the entertainment empire it is today. He acquired Pixar, Marvel, etc. I remember in 2017 when Iger's contract was up, many Disney fans were ready for a change, since the price was skyrocketing and it was no longer seen as a \"family vacation\" based on pricepoint.\n\nChapek will be interesting. I'm not totally familiar with his style, but I know that he was in charge of the Parks for a while before coming into this role. He was responsible for the \"Disney Vault\" which built a demand for Disney VHS tapes during his time with Disney studios. Chapek has a bad reputation amongst Disney fans because they believe he didn't really care about the parks. The benefit here is that someone who ***cares*** about the parks will now takeover and bring it back to the days of Eisner or early days of Iger before it all became business and souvenir-driven.\n\nFrom a business scale, Bob Chapek doesn't believe in spending any more than is needed and he did so with the parks.

Research their company and try to find information on game companies THEY are about to invest in. You need to jump on board RIGHT BEFORE they pull the trigger. \nMaking it so you can swoop in at a fair to low price stock of a smaller gaming company and then sell sell sell the day of or day after TENCENT does their massive buy. It will effectively boost the value of that stock exponentially and you\u2019ll essentially be selling to TENCENT themselves.\nTHIS METHOD DOESNT GO WITHOUT RISK. It\u2019s actually riskier than normal.

He took it from a theme park-centric company and built it into the entertainment empire it is today. He acquired Pixar, Marvel, etc. I remember in 2017 when Iger's contract was up, many Disney fans were ready for a change, since the price was skyrocketing and it was no longer seen as a \"family vacation\" based on pricepoint.\n\nChapek will be interesting. I'm not totally familiar with his style, but I know that he was in charge of the Parks for a while before coming into this role. He was responsible for the \"Disney Vault\" which built a demand for Disney VHS tapes during his time with Disney studios. Chapek has a bad reputation amongst Disney fans because they believe he didn't really care about the parks. The benefit here is that someone who ***cares*** about the parks will now takeover and bring it back to the days of Eisner or early days of Iger before it all became business and souvenir-driven.\n\nFrom a business scale, Bob Chapek doesn't believe in spending any more than is needed and he did so with the parks.
