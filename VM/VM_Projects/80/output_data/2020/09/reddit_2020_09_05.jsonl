And he doesn't even understand that there is not a one to one relationship between OI changes and deliveries, and further, he thinks there's some weird stuff going on with forward roll, when if he looked at the actual price curve for futures, it shows you *exactly why* there was more volume in March versus December than you would normally expect.

The people that predicted negative oil were actually people who had been involved in oil futures for very long periods of time.  Even I thought negative oil was more than possible.  And there was no conspiratorial bent to that prognostication.  It didn't have anything to do with shenanigans in the oil market, but everything to do with rampant speculation, particularly by foreign investors, who were buying up *far* too many long contracts because they \"were cheap\" and they didn't understand how futures markets worked, and that at some point, if you're long a contract, you *have to sell it* or take delivery.\n\nThe same is true of metals.  And this is why \"short squeeze\"es aren't really a thing in these markets.  It's the *longs* who are taking a highly risky and speculative bet... not the shorts.  And this is also why the *vast majority* of contracts are sold and rolled, usually at a loss.  A contract seller only needs to be able to deliver.  The whole reason the swap dealers exist at Comex is to enable producers and consumers to match up *without* having to have an assload of physical metals stashed there.  The physical metal there serves only one purpose: to enable swap dealers to conduct business.  It's only in markets like these where the 80-90% of what the Comex is there for gets overshadowed by speculators and money managers.\n\nBut, the swap dealers don't care which way the market goes.  They are hedged and only care about volume, because the more volume there is, the more money they make.

The people that predicted negative oil were actually people who had been involved in oil futures for very long periods of time.  Even I thought negative oil was more than possible.  And there was no conspiratorial bent to that prognostication.  It didn't have anything to do with shenanigans in the oil market, but everything to do with rampant speculation, particularly by foreign investors, who were buying up *far* too many long contracts because they \"were cheap\" and they didn't understand how futures markets worked, and that at some point, if you're long a contract, you *have to sell it* or take delivery.\n\nThe same is true of metals.  And this is why \"short squeeze\"es aren't really a thing in these markets.  It's the *longs* who are taking a highly risky and speculative bet... not the shorts.  And this is also why the *vast majority* of contracts are sold and rolled, usually at a loss.  A contract seller only needs to be able to deliver.  The whole reason the swap dealers exist at Comex is to enable producers and consumers to match up *without* having to have an assload of physical metals stashed there.  The physical metal there serves only one purpose: to enable swap dealers to conduct business.  It's only in markets like these where the 80-90% of what the Comex is there for gets overshadowed by speculators and money managers.\n\nBut, the swap dealers don't care which way the market goes.  They are hedged and only care about volume, because the more volume there is, the more money they make.
