The only vehicle being considered on the same metrics is the Porche Taychan and its $190K, has less range and only beats a model S on one metric (high speed acceleration). Not by much. \n\n\nThey\u2019re going to win self-driving. Waymo and others are using a Lidar sensor suite. This takes a 3D image of the area using a spinning mirror that refracts and collects light(sort of). \n\nThis system is very expensive, last i checked 10K but probably less. It is also computationally very expensive which is the bigger issue. Waymo cars have at least $20K of computers in their cars. \n\nWhat tesla did was use cameras and science to make the cameras do the same thing our eyes do\n(Infer depth from 2 closely related images). The cameras are cheaper but most importantly the images processed are computationally significantly less for the computer to deal with. \n\nAnd then there is the argument that big data always wins. The premise here is that essentially neural nets are kind of a dime a dozen these days. They\u2019re value correlates very strongly to how much data is available for the net to process. \n\nTesla is absolutely destroying everyone else in this category. \n\nTesla has also created their own chip to optimize their neural net\u2019s capabilities. This is a big deal but look it up if u care to wont go into it. \n\nBeyond all of this, battery day is coming out and I think they\u2019re going to announce they are not 3 years but a decade ahead in battery tech. Many of us have good info on whats likely coming out on battery day and its nothing to sneeze at.\n\nEdit: safest cars in the world, own insurance products, solar, vertically integrated business, best engineers in the world\n\n\nFinally lets talk about Elon.

And I did sell some positions and buy some new ones, one of which is up 400% and I wouldve sold at close if not for the PDT bullshit, so from open to close I lost more than $2500 of pure gains because I got fucking greedy. $2500 is more than triple what I started this account with.

The only vehicle being considered on the same metrics is the Porche Taychan and its $190K, has less range and only beats a model S on one metric (high speed acceleration). Not by much. \n\n\nThey\u2019re going to win self-driving. Waymo and others are using a Lidar sensor suite. This takes a 3D image of the area using a spinning mirror that refracts and collects light(sort of). \n\nThis system is very expensive, last i checked 10K but probably less. It is also computationally very expensive which is the bigger issue. Waymo cars have at least $20K of computers in their cars. \n\nWhat tesla did was use cameras and science to make the cameras do the same thing our eyes do\n(Infer depth from 2 closely related images). The cameras are cheaper but most importantly the images processed are computationally significantly less for the computer to deal with. \n\nAnd then there is the argument that big data always wins. The premise here is that essentially neural nets are kind of a dime a dozen these days. They\u2019re value correlates very strongly to how much data is available for the net to process. \n\nTesla is absolutely destroying everyone else in this category. \n\nTesla has also created their own chip to optimize their neural net\u2019s capabilities. This is a big deal but look it up if u care to wont go into it. \n\nBeyond all of this, battery day is coming out and I think they\u2019re going to announce they are not 3 years but a decade ahead in battery tech.
