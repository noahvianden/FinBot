{"title": "Intel - Undervalued and Due for Pop (Cheap Options Play)", "selftext": "Not sure why more people aren\u2019t talking about Intel (INTC), especially given the recent run-up we\u2019ve seen from rival AMD. INTC is only up 8% from yearly lows, and severely underpriced in my opinion, and see serious runway in the next few months back up to February highs of $65-$68 \u2013 options are cheap as well with IV only at 40% in most cases. \n\n**Earnings and Revenue Beat** \n\nQ2 earnings were up 16% and revenue was up by over 20%, despite COVID. The stock dropped admittedly as people looked to delayed 7 nano-meter processors until 2022, which isn\u2019t great (AMD\u2019s is in market), but people have overlooked their core revenue drivers that supported earnings beat in the pandemic. See the chart below from last week \u2013 the 13% drop in the stock only puts it closer to support at around the $55 level.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Things to Consider:** \n\n\u2022\tIntel is the worlds largest chip maker, and boasts high return on assets by free cash flow \n\n\u2022\tIntel is still a high growth company \u2013 namely in revenue and free cashflow. Worth also looking at gross profit growth, operating income growth and EPS growth \n\n\u2022\tStrong balance sheet strength and trend \n\n\u2022\tHigh yield backed by strong dividend coverage by free cash flow and strong financial statement trends \n\n\u2022\tWorth looking at how many hedge funds (smart money) picked up Intel in Q1/Q2 ([https://www.yahoo.com/news/hedge-funds-never-bullish-intel-163602103.html](https://www.yahoo.com/news/hedge-funds-never-bullish-intel-163602103.html))\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Cheap Options / Low IV** \n\nIV is minimal on most Sept-Oct calls, and volume is great given that it\u2019s the worlds largest chipmaker. INTC still ranks as 9.3/10 in Equity Summary score and longer-term outlook remains very bullish \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR / Positions: 9/11 $50c for 1.2c**\n\nWhile there is some short-term turbulence involved, INTC remains underpriced given market comps and strong financials and growth GM trend point to Sept/Oct price target in $57-$65 range.

{"title": "Intel - Undervalued and Due for Pop (Cheap Options Play)", "selftext": "Not sure why more people aren\u2019t talking about Intel (INTC), especially given the recent run-up we\u2019ve seen from rival AMD. INTC is only up 8% from yearly lows, and severely underpriced in my opinion, and see serious runway in the next few months back up to February highs of $65-$68 \u2013 options are cheap as well with IV only at 40% in most cases. \n\n**Earnings and Revenue Beat** \n\nQ2 earnings were up 16% and revenue was up by over 20%, despite COVID. The stock dropped admittedly as people looked to delayed 7 nano-meter processors until 2022, which isn\u2019t great (AMD\u2019s is in market), but people have overlooked their core revenue drivers that supported earnings beat in the pandemic. See the chart below from last week \u2013 the 13% drop in the stock only puts it closer to support at around the $55 level.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Things to Consider:** \n\n\u2022\tIntel is the worlds largest chip maker, and boasts high return on assets by free cash flow \n\n\u2022\tIntel is still a high growth company \u2013 namely in revenue and free cashflow. Worth also looking at gross profit growth, operating income growth and EPS growth \n\n\u2022\tStrong balance sheet strength and trend \n\n\u2022\tHigh yield backed by strong dividend coverage by free cash flow and strong financial statement trends \n\n\u2022\tWorth looking at how many hedge funds (smart money) picked up Intel in Q1/Q2 ([https://www.yahoo.com/news/hedge-funds-never-bullish-intel-163602103.html](https://www.yahoo.com/news/hedge-funds-never-bullish-intel-163602103.html))\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Cheap Options / Low IV** \n\nIV is minimal on most Sept-Oct calls, and volume is great given that it\u2019s the worlds largest chipmaker. INTC still ranks as 9.3/10 in Equity Summary score and longer-term outlook remains very bullish \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR / Positions: 9/11 $50c for 1.2c**\n\nWhile there is some short-term turbulence involved, INTC remains underpriced given market comps and strong financials and growth GM trend point to Sept/Oct price target in $57-$65 range.
