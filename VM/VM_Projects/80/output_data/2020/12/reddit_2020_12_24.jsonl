On this shortened market day I bought the dip on PLTR as it was down about -3.5%. \n\nI believe that PLTR is a solid company and I have a PT of $40 within the next 3-4 months, so this is the play. \n\nPosition: March 19 $40C \n\nThe DD:\n- As some of you might know PLTR is still not profitable but I have faith that the PayPal mafia will turn that around for the company. this companies leadership is incredible and it will be shown in the upcoming month. Also the CEO has ties with Papa Elon so that\u2019s always a plus. \n\n- In addition, we have all seen how PLTR reacts to catalysts and as it hovers in the 25-28 dollar range it is primed for another moon mission. The March calls allow enough time for a serious catalyst to run up the price. \n\n- Also. EARNINGS BABY!!!! PLTR will report earnings on March 15 and we all know the pump that will result from this. This is close to expiration but the run up to earnings will pump up the value of the option, and the plan is to sell before Theta and IV fuck you. \n\n- Finally, the sentiment around PLTR is amazing. Many funds are buying it or already bought into it pre-ipo. They are all long on this company and I expect a PT boost from many institutions and hopefully this will happen early into the new year\n\nAll in all, PLTR MOON MISSION and may the tendies be with you, always. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80", "id": "kjlijt", "created_utc": 1608839194.0, "score": 246, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 77, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 90, "replies": [{"body": "Good point, but I do think that if there is a major sell off there will be a quick recovery as this is a very hyped play.

On this shortened market day I bought the dip on PLTR as it was down about -3.5%. \n\nI believe that PLTR is a solid company and I have a PT of $40 within the next 3-4 months, so this is the play. \n\nPosition: March 19 $40C \n\nThe DD:\n- As some of you might know PLTR is still not profitable but I have faith that the PayPal mafia will turn that around for the company. this companies leadership is incredible and it will be shown in the upcoming month. Also the CEO has ties with Papa Elon so that\u2019s always a plus. \n\n- In addition, we have all seen how PLTR reacts to catalysts and as it hovers in the 25-28 dollar range it is primed for another moon mission. The March calls allow enough time for a serious catalyst to run up the price. \n\n- Also. EARNINGS BABY!!!! PLTR will report earnings on March 15 and we all know the pump that will result from this. This is close to expiration but the run up to earnings will pump up the value of the option, and the plan is to sell before Theta and IV fuck you. \n\n- Finally, the sentiment around PLTR is amazing. Many funds are buying it or already bought into it pre-ipo. They are all long on this company and I expect a PT boost from many institutions and hopefully this will happen early into the new year\n\nAll in all, PLTR MOON MISSION and may the tendies be with you, always. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80", "id": "kjlijt", "created_utc": 1608839194.0, "score": 246, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 77, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 90, "replies": [{"body": "Good point, but I do think that if there is a major sell off there will be a quick recovery as this is a very hyped play.
