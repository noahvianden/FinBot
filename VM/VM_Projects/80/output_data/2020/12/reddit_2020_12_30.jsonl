{"title": "Why I'm emptying my bank account and buying long $GOOGL calls", "selftext": "Google seems to get a lot less love than the other tech behemoths. They are sadly not the cutthroat capitalists like Apple or Amazon. But they spend a shit ton on R&D projects like self-driving cars and other weird \u201cmoonshots\u201d that are going to start paying off soon. The nerds in [Silicon Valley](https://www.businessinsider.com/most-desired-tech-companies-to-work-for-google-netflix-slack-2020-9) every year say Google is their most desired company to work for. I've decided to put my all my savings into long options.\n\n**Some Google initiatives or statistics that are cool but not why they are undervalued:**\n\n**Android market share worldwide:** 73%\n\n**Search market share:** 87%\n\n**Youtube:** 600 hours of video uploaded every minute, ad revenues through the roof\n\n**Stadia:** One of projects from their \u201cmoonshot factory\u201d that looked like it would fail spectacularly until the disaster of Cyberpunk 2077 on consoles showed Stadia could provide mid-tier PC performance on games minus the $2,000 for a PC. Huge increase in users since Cyberpunk fiasco.\n\n**Why I\u2019m going all in: Google is going to take over the world with AI**\n\nGoogle owns the top two AI outfits in the world, Google Brain and DeepMind. They are far ahead of their competitors in the most important industry of the future.\n\nDeepMind\u2019s AI team solved protein folding this past month. Experts didn\u2019t think this would be possible for decades. Their team will receive the first Nobel Prize where a neural network did a majority of the work. The monetization and scientific breakthrough possibilities for their proprietary protein folding prediction models are endless. ([more info](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7wJDJ56c88))\n\nGoogle Brain and Deepmind are working with Waymo. No other self-driving company has technology that is remotely close to Waymo. Google proprietary AI processors allow them to simulate billions of miles on the road and millions of people help train their models with captchas everyday. Their taxis are already in Arizona with no human operators. There have been no injuries to passengers. There isn\u2019t a very small chance the car will kill you like with some [Waymo](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/feb/25/tesla-driver-autopilot-crash) [competitors](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/03/20/us/self-driving-uber-pedestrian-killed.html). Uber realized the threat that Waymo posed to their business and tried to steal their technology. Waymo destroyed them in court and Uber sold off their self-driving operation this past month. Waymo will be first to market partnered with Lyft and will be significantly cheaper than Uber rides with human drivers.

Could definitely be bad for business but they did recently fire one of the libs for jeopardizing their AI business. \n\n**Politicians want to fuck them.** There is a lot of anti-big tech sentiment on both sides of the aisle now but this has more to do with their enemies (Oracle, Yelp, etc) trying to litigate rather than innovate. I just don\u2019t see politicians breaking up a business that consistently ranks as one of the most respected brands in the country according to Morning Consult and which provides so many useful free services to constituents. \n\n**Trades made so far**\n\nGOOGL $3,000 1/20/2023\n\nGOOGL $2,900 1/20/2023\n\n**Disclaimer: I\u2019m retarded**", "id": "kndkc7", "created_utc": 1609370890.0, "score": 99, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 87, "comments": [{"body": "Love the DD on this one.

It is no longer just email now but it is now the starting point for a lot of people's business apps (sheets, docs, presentations, google sites, etc).  I was recently trying to assemble all of our random documentation at work (software engineer) and couldn't think of a way to do it without purchasing a product which would have been a non starter. I ended up using a google site to build an internal documentation portal which integrates perfectly with our google drive that we already use heavily and, even better, authentication/user provisioning is already taken care of because **every single employee already has a gmail account**.  This is huge because distribution and integration of new products are a significant hurdle when it comes to launching enterprise software and the ubiquity of gmail and google apps solves both of these problems. I think google will eventually launch a no-code or enterprise software product that sits within google apps, which ultimately sits on top of gmail.

They have great engineers and talent, as you said, but they are dog shit at making new products that people adopt. Google today is basically a trust fund baby living off of investments made in mid 2000s/ early 2010s.\n\n\nThink of all the products google has launched in last 5 years, none have been a big success or even took significant market share. Every product they have launched has been trash in last 5 years. Their product vision is confusing as hell. They had 4 different payment apps at one point, 3 different messaging apps too. They keep rebranding shit like YouTube TV every other year to a point where people lose track of what is what. \n\nGoogle is losing its edge day by day, it is no longer the top paying employer in Silicon Valley anymore. Netflix, airbnb, Facebook etc pay way more than google and google is haemorrhaging talent left and right. I have several friends in google and they are all thinking of leaving to younger companies with more hunger for growth like airbnb, Netflix. Netflix pays upto 30% more than google in some cases.\n\n\nCompanies like amazon, apple, whose stock \nhas been on fire in the last few years compared to google are now becoming more appealing too. \n\nGoogle fucking up cloud and giving amazon the lead is the biggest and most unforgivable mistake. Along the lines of Microsoft fucking up cellphone OS. \n\nTheir attempts at building hardware were a colossal shitshow, pixel phone sales are minuscule compared to iPhones. This is while having android with them. Compare how apple is with software with google is with hardware. Compare how both companies do outside of their core competency. Apple is so good with software compared to how google is with hardware. They wanted to compete with apple on hardware? Decided to buy HTC and failed miserably. Then they wanted to get into wearables after they saw how well Apple Watch is doing and now want to buy Fitbit. This acquisition has run into so many issues in multiple countries and is wasting years of time. They tried to make their own wearables like earbuds, which barely made a difference. So now they seem to be giving up on hardware completely.\n\nOverall, google has a severe management and company culture issue and it is holding the company back. In my opinion, google has some great products that will make them money for a long time, but Their best days are behind them. None of their new bets are working, their product execution is complete trash, company culture and management has been completely consumed with political wokeness. \n\nThe day someone comes up with a legit alternative to YouTube is the day I am going to say google is the next GE or IBM.\n\nGoogle today is very poorly run, if there ever is a company that has Amazon\u2019s management style and google\u2019s resources and talent, that company would take over the world. Amazon is an exceptionally well run company. I am more bullish about amazon than google, because Amazon can adapt like no other company of that size and has a killer instinct that\u2019s missing in google.\n\nGoogle will be able to hold on to the top level talent that you rightly pointed out with deep mind and google brain etc only for a little bit longer. Other companies are paying more for talent than google now, competition for talent is rising. Companies like Facebook, apple have tons of cash and are eating into google\u2019s talent pool. Google\u2019s stock has been pretty dull compared to amazon, apple, Facebook in the last few years and that makes a big difference in compensation as a huge chunk of total compensation is RSU. If your stock does not grow much, people will leave. Google has a few years before it\u2019s best leave to the next google, like how top talent from Motorola, Nokia left to apple in the early days of the iPhone. Or when top talent of intel left to apple because intel\u2019s management was indecisive and apple was throwing cash at people. \n\nThis has already started to happen, and if it picks up, google is in serious trouble.\n\nOn paper, google has everything it needs to take over the world.
