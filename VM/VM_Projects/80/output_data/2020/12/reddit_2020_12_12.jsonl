There are a lot of rumors floating regarding PSTH. Speculation without an LOI announced as of yet. Some moves seem much more likely than others ***but we are still in the dark.***\n\nIn August, PSCM CEO Bill Ackman wrote a letters to investors. In it he has a section dedicated to PSTH. You can find some of that below. I have bolded what I think are the most important parts highlighting the biggest clues. People like Ackman are careful with these letters, they are legacy, like with Buffet's letters.\n\n**Top Contenders**\n\n1. Stripe\n2. Fidelity\n3. Enterprise \n4. Subway\n\n***---------------------------*****Discussion Points below but check out the letter*****---------------------------***\n\n***Pershing Square Tontine Holdings, Ltd. - Letter to Shareholders***\n\nOn July 22nd, Pershing Square Tontine Holdings, Ltd. (\u201cPSTH\u201d) completed a $4 billion IPO on the New York Stock Exchange. We designed PSTH to be the most investor- and merger-friendly SPAC in the world. Apparently investors agreed, as we had more than $12 billion of demand for the offering when we stopped marketing the IPO on the second day of the road show. We capped the IPO at $4 billion, which, when added to the Pershing Square funds\u2019 minimum $1 billion commitment, created the largest blank check company in the world. \n\nWe capped the size of the public offering so that we would not materially limit the potential universe of merger candidates in which our shareholders would, via a merger, become a minority owner of the newly public company. We are seeking to own a minority interest in the newly merged company because we believe our willingness to be a minority owner will differentiate PSTH from the substantial majority of other private equity and strategic buyers who require control, and are therefore prepared to pay a substantial control premium. \n\n**Sellers are much more price sensitive when selling 100% or even a controlling interest in their business for obvious reasons. A seller\u2019s price sensitivity declines, however, when they are selling a smaller interest that allows them to achieve other important strategic objectives. We therefore expect that a potential PSTH merger partner will be much less price-sensitive in a transaction in which it, in effect, sells a minority interest in a merger with PSTH, which also allows it to raise $5 billion of equity capital and retain control of a newly public New York Stock Exchange listed company. In fact, the smaller the interest they are selling, the lesser the price sensitivity, which makes mergers with larger companies more likely to come on more advantaged terms than with smaller companies. PSTH\u2019s targeting of companies that are multiples of its size is designed to enable it to acquire a minority interest in the newly merged company at an attractive valuation.** \n\nWe have always believed that SPACs are interesting investment constructs. We have had an excellent experience and strong investment results from the first SPAC we co-sponsored in 2011 that merged with Burger King, the predecessor company to Restaurant Brands, which remains a core holding more than eight years after the merger. In principle, a properly structured SPAC with a strong sponsor should offer a much more attractive alternative to going public than through an initial public offering. This fact has begun to be appreciated more widely, including by members of the venture capital community. Recently, Bill Gurley, one of the world\u2019s leading venture capitalists, wrote a detailed blog post comparing SPACs and direct listings with initial public offerings. Bill makes a powerful case for SPACs. We encourage you to read his post: https:// [abovethecrowd.com/2020/08/23/going-public-circa-2020-door-3-the-spac/](https://abovethecrowd.com/2020/08/23/going-public-circa-2020-door-3-the-spac/) \n\nIn order to address these alignment issues, with PSTH we eliminated all forms of compensation, advisory fees, and founder shares. We further improved alignment issues by the Pershing Square funds committing to purchase a minimum of $1 billion of common stock and shareholder warrants on the same terms as PSTH\u2019s public shareholders. In addition, the Pershing Square funds purchased so-called Sponsor Warrants for $65 million \u2013 their estimated fair market value at the time of the IPO \u2013 that will become 10-year warrants on 5.95% of the newly merged company shares, only if we successfully complete a transaction. \n\nWe also negotiated and capped the underwriting fees payable at 1.8% of the SPAC\u2019s minimum equity capital, further reducing frictional costs. We paid two-thirds of these fees with the purchase of the Sponsor Warrants, which reduces the total frictional costs of PSTH in a merger borne by shareholders and our merger partner to a *de minimis* amount. \n\n**We used the excess demand for the PSTH IPO to curate a shareholder list that would be the envy of any public company. We selected investors for their reputation as long-term, value-added owners. We expect our shareholder registry will contribute to PSTH\u2019s appeal as a merger partner for a high-quality company.** \n\nWe also made a number of changes to the typical shareholder warrant structure of SPACs that minimizes the risk of shareholder redemptions. These structural changes, when coupled with our large amount of committed capital to the entity and our curated long-term shareholder base, reduce and likely eliminate the need to raise expensive so-called PIPE capital at the time a transaction is identified, a de facto requirement in nearly every other SPAC transaction. \n\n**The result of all of the above is that we now control a publicly traded, NYSE-listed company with $5 billion of equity capital that is seeking to merge and take public a large capitalization private company that meets our investment criteria for business quality, growth, and an attractive valuation. PSTH is the largest SPAC in the world with the least amount of frictional costs in a merger, making it a highly attractive alternative to an IPO. As such, we expect that PSTH will give Pershing Square\u2019s investors and PSTH\u2019s public shareholders unique access to an untapped universe of bespoke, large-capitalization investment opportunities.** \n\n**To give you a better understanding of the unique, large scale of PSTH, there have been only three U.S. IPOs in the last decade of $5 billion or more \u2013 Alibaba, Uber, and Facebook \u2013 and the degree of difficulty for completing an IPO increases materially with its size.** This makes PSTH an extremely attractive alternative for a company that would like to raise $5 billion or more of capital and go public, particularly during a period in the capital markets which is likely to be highly volatile and uncertain because of the economic impact of the virus, the upcoming presidential election, and the challenging political, social, and economic environment. Uncertainty is the enemy of the IPO and the friend of a $5 billion SPAC with the largest amount of committed capital.\n\n**We are in discussions with a number of potential companies that are owned and/or controlled by private equity firms, families, start-up company founders, as well as other private companies, and are encouraged by the initial interest that we have received.** \n\n\\-\n\n**William A.

There are a lot of rumors floating regarding PSTH. Speculation without an LOI announced as of yet. Some moves seem much more likely than others ***but we are still in the dark.***\n\nIn August, PSCM CEO Bill Ackman wrote a letters to investors. In it he has a section dedicated to PSTH. You can find some of that below. I have bolded what I think are the most important parts highlighting the biggest clues. People like Ackman are careful with these letters, they are legacy, like with Buffet's letters.\n\n**Top Contenders**\n\n1. Stripe\n2. Fidelity\n3. Enterprise \n4. Subway\n\n***---------------------------*****Discussion Points below but check out the letter*****---------------------------***\n\n***Pershing Square Tontine Holdings, Ltd. - Letter to Shareholders***\n\nOn July 22nd, Pershing Square Tontine Holdings, Ltd. (\u201cPSTH\u201d) completed a $4 billion IPO on the New York Stock Exchange. We designed PSTH to be the most investor- and merger-friendly SPAC in the world. Apparently investors agreed, as we had more than $12 billion of demand for the offering when we stopped marketing the IPO on the second day of the road show. We capped the IPO at $4 billion, which, when added to the Pershing Square funds\u2019 minimum $1 billion commitment, created the largest blank check company in the world. \n\nWe capped the size of the public offering so that we would not materially limit the potential universe of merger candidates in which our shareholders would, via a merger, become a minority owner of the newly public company. We are seeking to own a minority interest in the newly merged company because we believe our willingness to be a minority owner will differentiate PSTH from the substantial majority of other private equity and strategic buyers who require control, and are therefore prepared to pay a substantial control premium. \n\n**Sellers are much more price sensitive when selling 100% or even a controlling interest in their business for obvious reasons. A seller\u2019s price sensitivity declines, however, when they are selling a smaller interest that allows them to achieve other important strategic objectives. We therefore expect that a potential PSTH merger partner will be much less price-sensitive in a transaction in which it, in effect, sells a minority interest in a merger with PSTH, which also allows it to raise $5 billion of equity capital and retain control of a newly public New York Stock Exchange listed company. In fact, the smaller the interest they are selling, the lesser the price sensitivity, which makes mergers with larger companies more likely to come on more advantaged terms than with smaller companies. PSTH\u2019s targeting of companies that are multiples of its size is designed to enable it to acquire a minority interest in the newly merged company at an attractive valuation.** \n\nWe have always believed that SPACs are interesting investment constructs. We have had an excellent experience and strong investment results from the first SPAC we co-sponsored in 2011 that merged with Burger King, the predecessor company to Restaurant Brands, which remains a core holding more than eight years after the merger. In principle, a properly structured SPAC with a strong sponsor should offer a much more attractive alternative to going public than through an initial public offering. This fact has begun to be appreciated more widely, including by members of the venture capital community. Recently, Bill Gurley, one of the world\u2019s leading venture capitalists, wrote a detailed blog post comparing SPACs and direct listings with initial public offerings. Bill makes a powerful case for SPACs. We encourage you to read his post: https:// [abovethecrowd.com/2020/08/23/going-public-circa-2020-door-3-the-spac/](https://abovethecrowd.com/2020/08/23/going-public-circa-2020-door-3-the-spac/) \n\nIn order to address these alignment issues, with PSTH we eliminated all forms of compensation, advisory fees, and founder shares. We further improved alignment issues by the Pershing Square funds committing to purchase a minimum of $1 billion of common stock and shareholder warrants on the same terms as PSTH\u2019s public shareholders. In addition, the Pershing Square funds purchased so-called Sponsor Warrants for $65 million \u2013 their estimated fair market value at the time of the IPO \u2013 that will become 10-year warrants on 5.95% of the newly merged company shares, only if we successfully complete a transaction. \n\nWe also negotiated and capped the underwriting fees payable at 1.8% of the SPAC\u2019s minimum equity capital, further reducing frictional costs. We paid two-thirds of these fees with the purchase of the Sponsor Warrants, which reduces the total frictional costs of PSTH in a merger borne by shareholders and our merger partner to a *de minimis* amount. \n\n**We used the excess demand for the PSTH IPO to curate a shareholder list that would be the envy of any public company. We selected investors for their reputation as long-term, value-added owners. We expect our shareholder registry will contribute to PSTH\u2019s appeal as a merger partner for a high-quality company.** \n\nWe also made a number of changes to the typical shareholder warrant structure of SPACs that minimizes the risk of shareholder redemptions. These structural changes, when coupled with our large amount of committed capital to the entity and our curated long-term shareholder base, reduce and likely eliminate the need to raise expensive so-called PIPE capital at the time a transaction is identified, a de facto requirement in nearly every other SPAC transaction. \n\n**The result of all of the above is that we now control a publicly traded, NYSE-listed company with $5 billion of equity capital that is seeking to merge and take public a large capitalization private company that meets our investment criteria for business quality, growth, and an attractive valuation. PSTH is the largest SPAC in the world with the least amount of frictional costs in a merger, making it a highly attractive alternative to an IPO. As such, we expect that PSTH will give Pershing Square\u2019s investors and PSTH\u2019s public shareholders unique access to an untapped universe of bespoke, large-capitalization investment opportunities.** \n\n**To give you a better understanding of the unique, large scale of PSTH, there have been only three U.S. IPOs in the last decade of $5 billion or more \u2013 Alibaba, Uber, and Facebook \u2013 and the degree of difficulty for completing an IPO increases materially with its size.** This makes PSTH an extremely attractive alternative for a company that would like to raise $5 billion or more of capital and go public, particularly during a period in the capital markets which is likely to be highly volatile and uncertain because of the economic impact of the virus, the upcoming presidential election, and the challenging political, social, and economic environment. Uncertainty is the enemy of the IPO and the friend of a $5 billion SPAC with the largest amount of committed capital.\n\n**We are in discussions with a number of potential companies that are owned and/or controlled by private equity firms, families, start-up company founders, as well as other private companies, and are encouraged by the initial interest that we have received.** \n\n\\-\n\n**William A.
