They are an agreement between you and another investor that's sort of like a bet on what the value of that security will be at the end of a specific date in the future and if you're right, you take a profit. How this actually happens is a bit more complicated. For a **call** or a bet that the price will go up, the agreement actually says that, if you're right, you get to buy the security from the other investor at the agreed upon price and sell it back to them at the market price. So if you were right, and the security moved above the value you predicted, you're buying it for less than it's worth and selling it back to them at a fair value, taking the profit. With a **put** or a bet that the price will go down, the agreement says that, if you're right and the security goes below your specified price, you get to buy it from the other investor at market price and sell it back to them at the agreed upon price, making a profit. In both cases, if you're wrong you aren't obligated to execute the trade and lose money by buying/selling the security at a loss, you instead just lose the money you paid to buy the contract. So the most you can ever lose with buying options is the amount you pay up front.\n\nSelling options just puts you on the opposite end of this. So the most you could ever make is the price the other person pays up front and you could theoretically lose an infinite amount of money. You, as a person who is completely new to this scene, should absolutely never do this until you have a *ton* of experience. This is  primarily a tool used by market makers (or MMs) as a small part of massively complex investing strategies aimed at profiting off of the difference between what buyers and sellers think a security or derivative is worth, known as the bid-ask spread.\n\nBut *again*, this is a very basic explanation and there's a shit ton of weird math that can fuck you up if you don't know what you're doing. You can even find yourself in a position where you lose money despite the security moving in the direction that you predicted because of things like IV crush or theta decay. Seriously, this stuff is not for beginners and if you don't know what you're doing, you will get eaten alive. Options trading is not the kind of thing where a two paragraph reddit post is enough to prepare you to actually do it with real money on the line.\n\nAlso, for the future, this sub is not aimed at beginners and will not generally be accommodating to questions like this. There's a certain amount of investing literacy that's expected in the discussions here despite how immature and ridiculous the day to day conversations are. There's a lot of great resources that can explain things like this in whatever detail you're comfortable with that are just a google search away and I'd suggest that if you want to avoid a ban, you use those before coming here for help. While everyone here was once a beginner, no one wants to be the person who gives a beginner false confidence to do something stupid and throw away money.

{"title": "PSA to any sad fucks who sold JNUG this morning", "selftext": "Listen up folks, we all know that the action in gold miners has been total bullshit the past 10 days. There's no way a mere 7% gold drop should cause a 50% drop in (non leveraged in case you autistic brothers don't recognize the ticker) GDX/GDXJ. Let me tell you why the dip and rip today isn't just some temporary spike like the morning dildos in SPY, and that large cap gold companies like GOLD/NEM/RGLD are now HUGE buys. \n\n1) **SELLOFF IS IRRATIONAL LIQUIDATION:** As far as I can tell the drops are Just liquidation, margin calls, people and 'tutes selling what they can to plug their bleeding assholes from autistic \"stonks only go up\" insanity of the Trump pump presidency. This has nothing to do with the profitability of gold mining companies, all these big players are literally making 50% profit margin on gold right now with all in sustaining costs of $800-1000 and realized costs on the world market of 1500 or higher. These guys are selling stocks with P/E and EV/EBITA ratios 2-3 times below that of the S&P \\[1\\] (yes, this is AFTER the S&P's PE has dropped to a \"mere\" 18.79 from the mid upper 20s.) Now selling fundamentally inexpensive assets to cover your retarded bets on fundamentally expensive assets must be the highlight of any fund manager's ignominious career in the trump era. DON'T DO IT. \n\n2) **CRASHING ENERGY COSTS:** the ongoing CRASH in oil is going to make costs even lower for these miners. Mining is a capital cost intensive business, and fuel makes up 10-25% of the cash costs of mining gold per ounce. Imagine what happens to profitability when up to a fourth of their cash costs goes down by half this year. IT WILL GO UP. That's more than can be said for almost any other sector in 2020. \\[2\\]\n\n3) **BEER VIRUS PROTECTION:** Virus FUD is not going to significantly effect mining operations.  Their administrative offices ensconced in safe chad offices in Vancouver, BC may be shut down, but they will keep mining gold and making BIG BOY gains. These large cap miners are diversified geographically (GOLD for instance has 8 operations, with 10+ exploration projects across 5 continents) and have had experience battling outbreaks already in god-forsaken places like rural Latin America, Africa and have already dealt with outbreaks of deadlier viruses such as Ebola and Zika. \\[3\\]\n\n4) **FINANCIAL HEALTH:** in the past, healthy finances and gold companies were like a bad joke. Companies were notorious for issuing huge amounts of debt, which depressed equity prices even as gold bottomed in 2015. Now, due to a complete abandonment of the mining/energy sectors by financiers, these miners have had trials by fire to reduce debt through RESPONSIBLE management. To use GOLD as an example again, it is a 28 billion dollar company that has only 2.4 billion in current liabilities, with 3.3 billion in cash, and earnings of 8.8 billion last year. Furthermore, its EV/EBITA is hovering around 4.5 \\[4\\], (compare to FCX, one of the biggest base metal miners at 11, or SPY sitting at \\~12+), which is beyond historically low. Any way you slice it the numbers indicate this is a great situation to be in for a company in a capital intensive industry. \n\n5) **GOLD PRICE:** I am sure even the most retarded in here don't think gold is going to go down with all of the world's central banks on the cusp of negative nominal rates, let alone real rates, entire industries literally going out of business and unemployment poised to rise in every 1st world economy thanks to all this responsible \"social distancing\" policy. All indications are that physical gold supplies are only going to dwindle going forward, with gold reserves already scarce before 2020 \\[5\\], and unprecedented demand only forecasted to rise even more \\[6,7\\]. yes check the source. your friendly deep state government IS MASSIVE LONGING gold, alongside your average timmy \"investor\" buying silver coins. \n\nI challenge anyone here to come up with a sector that is actually going to GROW earnings this year. I am counting on it personally. \n\n**TLDR: Do what Buffet swore never to do \\[8\\] (buy gold or gold equities), AND BUY THIS DIP IN  PARTICULAR, FAGGOT.** \n\nP.S.

They are an agreement between you and another investor that's sort of like a bet on what the value of that security will be at the end of a specific date in the future and if you're right, you take a profit. How this actually happens is a bit more complicated. For a **call** or a bet that the price will go up, the agreement actually says that, if you're right, you get to buy the security from the other investor at the agreed upon price and sell it back to them at the market price. So if you were right, and the security moved above the value you predicted, you're buying it for less than it's worth and selling it back to them at a fair value, taking the profit. With a **put** or a bet that the price will go down, the agreement says that, if you're right and the security goes below your specified price, you get to buy it from the other investor at market price and sell it back to them at the agreed upon price, making a profit. In both cases, if you're wrong you aren't obligated to execute the trade and lose money by buying/selling the security at a loss, you instead just lose the money you paid to buy the contract. So the most you can ever lose with buying options is the amount you pay up front.\n\nSelling options just puts you on the opposite end of this. So the most you could ever make is the price the other person pays up front and you could theoretically lose an infinite amount of money. You, as a person who is completely new to this scene, should absolutely never do this until you have a *ton* of experience. This is  primarily a tool used by market makers (or MMs) as a small part of massively complex investing strategies aimed at profiting off of the difference between what buyers and sellers think a security or derivative is worth, known as the bid-ask spread.\n\nBut *again*, this is a very basic explanation and there's a shit ton of weird math that can fuck you up if you don't know what you're doing. You can even find yourself in a position where you lose money despite the security moving in the direction that you predicted because of things like IV crush or theta decay. Seriously, this stuff is not for beginners and if you don't know what you're doing, you will get eaten alive. Options trading is not the kind of thing where a two paragraph reddit post is enough to prepare you to actually do it with real money on the line.\n\nAlso, for the future, this sub is not aimed at beginners and will not generally be accommodating to questions like this. There's a certain amount of investing literacy that's expected in the discussions here despite how immature and ridiculous the day to day conversations are. There's a lot of great resources that can explain things like this in whatever detail you're comfortable with that are just a google search away and I'd suggest that if you want to avoid a ban, you use those before coming here for help. While everyone here was once a beginner, no one wants to be the person who gives a beginner false confidence to do something stupid and throw away money.

{"title": "PSA to any sad fucks who sold JNUG this morning", "selftext": "Listen up folks, we all know that the action in gold miners has been total bullshit the past 10 days. There's no way a mere 7% gold drop should cause a 50% drop in (non leveraged in case you autistic brothers don't recognize the ticker) GDX/GDXJ. Let me tell you why the dip and rip today isn't just some temporary spike like the morning dildos in SPY, and that large cap gold companies like GOLD/NEM/RGLD are now HUGE buys. \n\n1) **SELLOFF IS IRRATIONAL LIQUIDATION:** As far as I can tell the drops are Just liquidation, margin calls, people and 'tutes selling what they can to plug their bleeding assholes from autistic \"stonks only go up\" insanity of the Trump pump presidency. This has nothing to do with the profitability of gold mining companies, all these big players are literally making 50% profit margin on gold right now with all in sustaining costs of $800-1000 and realized costs on the world market of 1500 or higher. These guys are selling stocks with P/E and EV/EBITA ratios 2-3 times below that of the S&P \\[1\\] (yes, this is AFTER the S&P's PE has dropped to a \"mere\" 18.79 from the mid upper 20s.) Now selling fundamentally inexpensive assets to cover your retarded bets on fundamentally expensive assets must be the highlight of any fund manager's ignominious career in the trump era. DON'T DO IT. \n\n2) **CRASHING ENERGY COSTS:** the ongoing CRASH in oil is going to make costs even lower for these miners. Mining is a capital cost intensive business, and fuel makes up 10-25% of the cash costs of mining gold per ounce. Imagine what happens to profitability when up to a fourth of their cash costs goes down by half this year. IT WILL GO UP. That's more than can be said for almost any other sector in 2020. \\[2\\]\n\n3) **BEER VIRUS PROTECTION:** Virus FUD is not going to significantly effect mining operations.  Their administrative offices ensconced in safe chad offices in Vancouver, BC may be shut down, but they will keep mining gold and making BIG BOY gains. These large cap miners are diversified geographically (GOLD for instance has 8 operations, with 10+ exploration projects across 5 continents) and have had experience battling outbreaks already in god-forsaken places like rural Latin America, Africa and have already dealt with outbreaks of deadlier viruses such as Ebola and Zika. \\[3\\]\n\n4) **FINANCIAL HEALTH:** in the past, healthy finances and gold companies were like a bad joke. Companies were notorious for issuing huge amounts of debt, which depressed equity prices even as gold bottomed in 2015. Now, due to a complete abandonment of the mining/energy sectors by financiers, these miners have had trials by fire to reduce debt through RESPONSIBLE management. To use GOLD as an example again, it is a 28 billion dollar company that has only 2.4 billion in current liabilities, with 3.3 billion in cash, and earnings of 8.8 billion last year. Furthermore, its EV/EBITA is hovering around 4.5 \\[4\\], (compare to FCX, one of the biggest base metal miners at 11, or SPY sitting at \\~12+), which is beyond historically low. Any way you slice it the numbers indicate this is a great situation to be in for a company in a capital intensive industry. \n\n5) **GOLD PRICE:** I am sure even the most retarded in here don't think gold is going to go down with all of the world's central banks on the cusp of negative nominal rates, let alone real rates, entire industries literally going out of business and unemployment poised to rise in every 1st world economy thanks to all this responsible \"social distancing\" policy. All indications are that physical gold supplies are only going to dwindle going forward, with gold reserves already scarce before 2020 \\[5\\], and unprecedented demand only forecasted to rise even more \\[6,7\\]. yes check the source. your friendly deep state government IS MASSIVE LONGING gold, alongside your average timmy \"investor\" buying silver coins. \n\nI challenge anyone here to come up with a sector that is actually going to GROW earnings this year. I am counting on it personally. \n\n**TLDR: Do what Buffet swore never to do \\[8\\] (buy gold or gold equities), AND BUY THIS DIP IN  PARTICULAR, FAGGOT.** \n\nP.S. I am not as retarded as most of you folks so I am long 50 1/21 GOLD 22.00 calls among other shit, proof here:  [https://imgur.com/a/NeAYmxO](https://imgur.com/a/NeAYmxO) \n\nSources:\n\n\\[1\\] [https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ETGrp2IWAAAyn8\\_?format=jpg&name=medium](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ETGrp2IWAAAyn8_?format=jpg&name=medium)\n\n\\[2\\] [https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/7/12/saupload\\_Screen\\_Shot\\_2018-07-10\\_at\\_12.23.24\\_PM.png](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/7/12/saupload_Screen_Shot_2018-07-10_at_12.23.24_PM.png)\n\n\\[3\\]  [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-barrick-gold/barrick-stockpiling-supplies-as-mining-industry-braces-for-coronavirus-idUSKBN20T1GJ](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-barrick-gold/barrick-stockpiling-supplies-as-mining-industry-braces-for-coronavirus-idUSKBN20T1GJ) \n\n\\[4\\]  [https://www.gurufocus.com/term/ev2ebitda/GOLD/EV-to-EBITDA/Randgold-Resources-Ltd](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/ev2ebitda/GOLD/EV-to-EBITDA/Randgold-Resources-Ltd) \n\n\\[5\\]  [https://markets.businessinsider.com/commodities/news/warren-buffett-bashes-gold-2019-2-1027977003](https://markets.businessinsider.com/commodities/news/warren-buffett-bashes-gold-2019-2-1027977003) \n\n\\[5\\] [https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/dc10f4b92a777d246f3c2c66098cd1c1?width=650](https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/dc10f4b92a777d246f3c2c66098cd1c1?width=650)\n\n\\[6\\] [https://www.kitco.com/news/2019-01-31/images/chart.png](https://www.kitco.com/news/2019-01-31/images/chart.png)\n\n\\[7\\]  [https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/coronavirus/card/u4qjZDrkGuuPLxl29J38](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/coronavirus/card/u4qjZDrkGuuPLxl29J38) \n\n\\[8\\]  [https://markets.businessinsider.com/commodities/news/warren-buffett-bashes-gold-2019-2-1027977003](https://markets.businessinsider.com/commodities/news/warren-buffett-bashes-gold-2019-2-1027977003)", "id": "fjpfbf", "created_utc": 1584382168.0, "score": 107, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 84, "comments": [{"body": "Fucking works cited and shit. \n\nSeems legit all in.", "score": 100, "replies": [{"body": "I have spent more time in this sector than I care to share.
