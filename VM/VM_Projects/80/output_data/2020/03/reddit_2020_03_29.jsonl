TLDR: the market always is irrational and mostly cares about what Trump says, doesn\u2019t care about facts. Your 4/17 puts are safe, read part 3 - Bargaining. \n\n1 Denial - obviously the market isn\u2019t as smart as any pseudo analyst here wants to make it look like and just shrugged off beer flu. \nAlso I, while I think that Trump is not adequate to do the job, his word obviously influences the market a lot. The market didn\u2019t need to panic as long as Trump denied all the threats Corona is posing to us. He always said that the US had it under control blah blah. \n\n2 Anger - the market is angry at the bad and Late response by the Western world and also by the fact that the US stock market was inflated and had liquidity issues. Also Trump\u2019s language changes. He starts to call it a pandemic and declares national emergency. It\u2019s time to panic. \n\n3 Bargaining WE ARE HERE - it\u2019s not all bad. Infinite QE, stimulus bill, unemployment numbers slightly lower than the worst case 4 mil. But I think that mostly one thing affected the markets this week: Trump said that he wants to re-open the country at Easter. That\u2019s an immensely great sign for the market. People would work again and definitely spend even more money on consumption to \u201acelebrate\u2018 the fact that we all survived beer virus. \nThis is why I think that all your April puts are relatively safe. As soon as Trump admits that this shitshow will continue until May or even June, the market will realize that its hopes of a sudden re-opening are futile and drop even more in a short period of time. That would be your last moment to get rid of your April puts. \n\n4 Depression - welcome to the next months. \n\n5 Acceptance - as much as I love earning money from insane OTM puts, I want this to be over as soon as possible.
