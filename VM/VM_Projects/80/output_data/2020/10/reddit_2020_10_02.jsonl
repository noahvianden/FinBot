More core, higher clocks, more cache, what more do people want? Current estimates will be a 15% performance gain compared to last generation parts.\n\n*\"Recent benchmarks from the Ashes of the Singularity benchmark database show the Ryzen 7 5800X crushing it at 8-cores and 16-threads, which could be indicative of decent performance to come. That particular database isn't all that useful in comparative performance between AMD and Intel, however, as it heavily favours the former\"* \\- The CPU is already showing impressive performance on this leaked benchmark.\n\n*\" Even eight-core chips are roughly 25% cheaper thanks to chiplets.\"* \\- The chips will be able to be produced cheaper while getting better performance.\n\n(btw it is believed that AMD is skipping the 4000 series name for their desktops because of some benchmarks being registered under the 5000 series title. This has also been somewhat confirmed by some people on twitter who supposedly work at AMD)\n\n# Big Navi Having Possibly Better Performance Than 3080\n\nThere have been leaks off Newegg of Big Navi being better than the 3080. Even if the cards are neck in neck AMD will be able to paint the 6000 series cards as better due to minor discrepancies.\n\nRadeon RX 6900 XT\t5,120\t1,500\t16GB GDDR6\t512\t256-bit\t300\n\nRadeon RX 6800 XT\t3,840\t1,500\t12GB GDDR6\t384\t192-bit\t200\n\nRadeon RX 6700 XT\t2,560\t1,500\t6GB GDDR6\t384\t192-bit\t150\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[A roadmap showing what is coming](https://preview.redd.it/8h8r1pfvslq51.png?width=2060&format=png&auto=webp&s=be023cd32e2c77d3de4670f6599980d3e4813c5a)\n\n**NVIDIA 3rd Party Card Catastrophe**\n\n*(this section is from my previous post)*\n\nSo most GPUs are made by a 3rd party. AMD and NVIDIA make the actual \"brain\" of the GPU but 3rd party partners add onto it for better performance (very basic explanation). Don't ask me why this is, it is just mainly because of logistical reasons.\n\nBut that is not the point, the point is that the great majority of GPUs are third-party cards meaning that they get to change around the design of the PCB. The issue here is that some of these third-party partners cheaped out on little capacitors.\n\nBy cheapening out it is leading to bad power delivery. The only way to fix this rn is to downclock the card which the normal person doesn't know how to do and doesn't expect is necessary when they are buying a 500$+ piece of hardware.\n\nI feel like if there is a mass callback that will be bad PR. NVIDIA could always release drivers that make the cards run below their listed spec but i'm not sure if people will really want that even if the performance loss is marginal.\n\nEVGA already confirmed the suspicions that these cards were crashing because of capacitor issues. It may be different for other companies but at least for EVGA this is what they are saying currently.\n\n**But why does this matter??**\n\nPeople who were looking to pick up a next-gen GPU right away are now hesitant and will wait for AMDS offerings. The people who did return their GPUs will also possibly wait. Faulty cards will most likely get a down clock which will make Big Navi look better. It supposedly already is better and this 3-5% difference could really change people's minds.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLisa Su is a God\n\nShe will for sure talk about their timeline and plans for 5nm/3nm. I am guessing that this will rally investors to invest because they will see shinny 5nm/3nm while Intel is just getting to 10nm.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Unit](https://preview.redd.it/dim9stofslq51.png?width=265&format=png&auto=webp&s=e06b8872d525bbae89fa0748846358cce103eac9)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nImportant dates:\n\n**CPU IS OCTOBER 8th and GPUS RUMOURED ON EITHER THE 20th or 28/29th**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**POSITIONS:**\n\n\\+95 call  (exp 12/18)-100 call (exp 12/18)\n\nEdit: Also I might get 100 November 20th calls\n\n(*call me a pussy for using a debit spread but I think its the best for my case)*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nif you have something else you want to share comments below and I will add it!\n\nSources:\n\n[https://videocardz.com/newz/amd-ryzen-9-3950x-to-become-worlds-first-16-core-gaming-cpu](https://videocardz.com/newz/amd-ryzen-9-3950x-to-become-worlds-first-16-core-gaming-cpu)\n\n[https://www.igorslab.de/en/what-real-what-can-be-investigative-within-the-crashes-and-instabilities-of-the-force-rtx-3080-andrtx-3090/](https://www.igorslab.de/en/what-real-what-can-be-investigative-within-the-crashes-and-instabilities-of-the-force-rtx-3080-andrtx-3090/)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6bUUEEe-X8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6bUUEEe-X8)\n\n[https://www.tomshardware.com/news/evga-nvidia-rtx-3080-capacitor-caused-crashes](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/evga-nvidia-rtx-3080-capacitor-caused-crashes)\n\n[https://www.tomshardware.com/news/newegg-insider-reportedly-reveals-radeon-rx-6900-xt-rx-6800xt-rx-6700-xt-specifications](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/newegg-insider-reportedly-reveals-radeon-rx-6900-xt-rx-6800xt-rx-6700-xt-specifications)[https://www.pcgamer.com/amd-ryzen-5000-zen-3-release-date-specs-performance/](https://www.pcgamer.com/amd-ryzen-5000-zen-3-release-date-specs-performance/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hwefn84pslq51.png?width=662&format=png&auto=webp&s=91c1948b5b104bbdefcbaa2c1e3e40e303e7da42", "id": "j3me70", "created_utc": 1601605533.0, "score": 96, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 83, "comments": [{"body": "you know its legit when they add a disclaimer at the end\n\nall fucking in", "score": 88, "replies": [{"body": "Lmao this made me laugh\n\nDon\u2019t go all in tho bro", "score": 15, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 47, "replies": [{"body": "Someone said we are already on the moon with amd so we are going to fucking Mars\n\nSo while you are at it also get some TSLA 10/1 1000$ calls", "score": 6, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla", "amd"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.0661698579788208}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.18657857179641724}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.0017192121595144272}, {"body": "Another dude getting an ascending triangle up in the ass.", "score": 18, "replies": [{"body": "I saw that shit lol", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "He wasn\u2019t wrong though....", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Yea I didn\u2019t mean to refer to it as actual shit I was just saying I saw it, I\u2019m personally not a big ta guy", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah I was just thinking the general consensus in that thread was \u201cfuck this kid\u201d but it turns out he was right.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "The kid literally drew a straight line across and called it an ascending triangle LOL.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "More logic than most of the retards in this subreddit!", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.21873804926872253}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.29851487278938293}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2144550383090973}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2075721025466919}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.13616517186164856}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2550230026245117}, {"body": "Good call dawg", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.08633158355951309}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.05677719786763191}, {"body": "22 calls at 120 for 11/20.
