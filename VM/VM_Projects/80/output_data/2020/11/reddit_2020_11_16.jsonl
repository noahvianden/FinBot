Every time I try to understand that, I come up empty. Just as empty as the reason why SPY waited so long. They knew TSLA was coming, they knew it was going to become eligible at some point. They should have prepared for it and announced inclusion the day after Q2 results. So not doing that was the first big mistake.\n\nSecond mistake was to wait for Q3. I mean, sure, the stock fell sharply as all the gamblers got out, but the gamblers were in in the first place because of the negligance in the first place. So it sort of was too late at that point, but after the stock went down and TSLA issued new shares, there was a period where gamblers were not an issue. They missed that.\n\nNow, they give TSLA a 30 day runway. They know index funds would buy close to inclusion date. So what time do they need to prepare? This only gives gamblers the opportunity to front run the index funds and squeeze them. It all could have been over within 5 days with a massive increase in stock value.. but with this long runway, the float might get artificially reduced. So that might have been the final mistake. SPY might have started to dig its own grave as index funds dont want to be exposed to this kind of stupidity.\n\nSo what I am doing here, I am posting the hypothesis that the index funds will get squeezed. Obviously we only know after the fact, but as hypothesis goes, you can try to invalidate it by finding a counter argument. So.. does any of you have an idea how this 30 day runway could help the index funds? If so, how? How can this not end in a massive squeeze?", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "There\u2019s no set rules that if the funds don\u2019t do something they get a fine.

For long term traders i believe this does not really matter much but just the fact tesla got into snp500 is good for the stock based on reliabilty and backing of the index funds.

Every time I try to understand that, I come up empty. Just as empty as the reason why SPY waited so long. They knew TSLA was coming, they knew it was going to become eligible at some point. They should have prepared for it and announced inclusion the day after Q2 results. So not doing that was the first big mistake.\n\nSecond mistake was to wait for Q3. I mean, sure, the stock fell sharply as all the gamblers got out, but the gamblers were in in the first place because of the negligance in the first place. So it sort of was too late at that point, but after the stock went down and TSLA issued new shares, there was a period where gamblers were not an issue. They missed that.\n\nNow, they give TSLA a 30 day runway. They know index funds would buy close to inclusion date. So what time do they need to prepare? This only gives gamblers the opportunity to front run the index funds and squeeze them. It all could have been over within 5 days with a massive increase in stock value.. but with this long runway, the float might get artificially reduced. So that might have been the final mistake. SPY might have started to dig its own grave as index funds dont want to be exposed to this kind of stupidity.\n\nSo what I am doing here, I am posting the hypothesis that the index funds will get squeezed. Obviously we only know after the fact, but as hypothesis goes, you can try to invalidate it by finding a counter argument. So.. does any of you have an idea how this 30 day runway could help the index funds? If so, how?

So there IS some concentration.\n\nAlso, if Gary Black is to be believed, index fund managers are payed to track the index, not get a cheap price.

I think it goes down to the prisoner dilemma theory in a way.  I.e if \u201cwe\u201d as in those going \u201cagainst\u201d index funds cooperate by not selling shares the index funds will have to buy at a higher price.  But imo after the index funds buy up people will start selling to profit from the gains.  Therefore assuming people are looking out for their own interest the price might not go as high as you might expect because to each their own is incentivized at least in the short squeeze opportunity to make a profit.  For long term traders i believe this does not really matter much but just the fact tesla got into snp500 is good for the stock based on reliabilty and backing of the index funds.  Now back to short term i can see scenarios where short term holders cooperate and drive up price or one where people trade when they get a chance to lock in profits over and over again maybe not leading to as high of a short squeeze then you might think.
