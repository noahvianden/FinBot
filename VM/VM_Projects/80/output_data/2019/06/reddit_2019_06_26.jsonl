They are paying a fuck ton of cash to keep it on air like friends. Losing it will loosen some cash to spend on new projects and thats what will help netflix in the long run.\n\nNetflix is basically treated as a utility (I won\u2019t put any sources because I\u2019m lazy) so they have more downside protection then you guys think. When the office will be gone, it will be stale to those people that has been binge watching it for the last 7 years anyways. This will force people to watch the other content like netflix\u2019s original exclusive content. There\u2019s going to be some gems for sure like bird box where everyone will talk about it and makes memes and shit on it. That stuff sells a fuck ton of new subscriptions. \n\nNot every project will have that effect but netflix has a pretty solid and courageous management so they invest in studios that have ideas and balls like the studio that made birdbox. New goose eggs will come out in the future for sure. The only thing going tits up is your wife\u2019s tiddies in my face while I fuck her on the deck of my yatch.\n\nConclusion: buy puts.", "id": "c5lci2", "created_utc": 1561524488.0, "score": 49, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 79, "comments": [{"body": "too much competition incoming honestly", "score": 28, "replies": [{"body": "Yes, way too much competition.
