Normally in this situation, some shorts would have flipped, along with longs, they would squeeze the stubborn shorts to the moon. I don't have a logical answer, I do have a few observations that could help to explain why the shorts on TSLA are so determined.\n\n1. Tesla indeed is a dream target for shorts. As Jim Chanos said, \"... with all the factors, if you don't short TSLA, then what DO YOU short?\". Tesla is in a tough business world that's extremely difficult for newcomers. Tesla can't make money in small scale. It can't get to large scale because EV is a niche market. If EV does get to larger market size, the legacy companies will compete, they have more experience and resources so they will kill Tesla anyway. Tesla has a lot of debt. Tesla's incentives is running out while other EVs still have $7.5k incentives... I don't agree with shorts, but shorts agree with shorts.\n2. Even Charlie Munger said Tesla will fail. That influenced a lot of potential long investors.\n3. Tesla has a CEO who doesn't understand stock market and how Wall Street manipulate stocks, so the CEO from time to time does dumb things end up helping the shorts and hurting the longs. I'm a big fan of Elon, but what he has done/said in the past 9 years tells me he is not an expert on stocks.\n4. To summarize it, shorts consider this bet to be no risk. They will stay short until Tesla can actually show significant profit and continued growth potential. Longs should know we will not show profit for many years because we prefer growth. So this fight will continue for years.\n5. If long investors are smart, well educated about investment and trading, then shorts would have a much tougher time to manipulate the stock. My observation is a lot of retail longs are not experienced with trading and investment. Those manipulators sell Calls to retail longs, then drive down the stock take away all the money from them.\n6. Overall, TSLA shorts are well organized, I feel they have organizers and people helping with communication to coordinate their moves. Longs are like loose sand in a plate.\n\nIf I have $20B, I would put all the money into TSLA and squeeze shorts to hell. They deserve it.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for the summary.
