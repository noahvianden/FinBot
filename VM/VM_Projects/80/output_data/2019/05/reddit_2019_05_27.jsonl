Acquiring Disney (while I agree, would likely never happen) would provide instant reinforcement for many of it's already highly loyal customers to stick with a company that can now provide them yet another product they cherish and love. I believe that Apple would love to have the parks (an unforgettable experience) in it's portfolio because Apple likes to create lasting impressions on people, which is exactly what the parks and Disney's content do. \n\nLet's take Activision for example. Apple recently announced the gaming platform. Acquiring Activision would provide Apple with a massive repository of games, many of which have significant followings in the gaming industry, and the rights to distribute that content through their paid platform and receive 100% of the revenue for those games.
