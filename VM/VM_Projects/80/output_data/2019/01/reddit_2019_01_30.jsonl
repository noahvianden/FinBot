The other was closing a covered call that I had only recently opened in order to just take profit off the stock I bought. Some of my close outs could have been done better for more profit had I timed it right but being too greedy in the past has cost me so I generally try to just aim for 30-50% profit.\n\nI have never been assigned or called away on anything, being able to close both sides of my plays on AMD has just taken patience and to just stick with the strategy. AMDs ER did well for me but unfortunately I didn't hold onto my long position as everything closed on my limit orders this morning. I opened a 7/19 CSP just to keep my foot in the door, it broke my 45-60 DTE rule but it's still a 30 delta and I'm only comfortable going into a CSP at a $18-19 strike range. You can see on my history that I had some CSPs in December at $20 and $21 which back fired because AMD rose 10% then fell 10% in the span of 2 days and was only able to close them for minimal gains about a month later just to get the hell out of it and roll into something I'm more comfortable with.\n\nFor anyone wondering, I've been able to create 4 positions at a time, with some of the profit I took from December to early January, I was able to add in a bit more cash to open 5 positions at a time. I didn't include the dates that I closed my positions because it wasn't important to me for keeping track though it would've been easier for you guys to see the progress.\n\nAnyways I don't like bragging but I've seen a bunch of interest in this strategy so I wanted to share some results, would it have been better to simply buy and hold? I don't know, but it works for me since it gives me just enough hands on management in my portfolio that I can't screw it up too bad or feel bored with the approach.", "score": 35, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 15, "replies": [{"body": "I'm still learning this strategy.\n\nHow did you come up with his buy and hold profit of $3k?
