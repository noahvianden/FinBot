I would even guess that after fees and transaction costs most of these strategies don't even do that very well.   There are a few good papers on this topic.  [Here is one](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1928822) using the Russell 2000 which basically says most of the returns from these strategies come from holding the stock itself and the selling options part only helps a tiny bit and usually only when the market is trending down (i.e. it reduces your risk slightly).  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPS.

That said, I still do not believe that the Wheel works as good as you think because, in a stock like T, the option prices are so low right. Option prices are relative. The amount of money you collect is tied to the risk you are taking. If T is moving in a tight range, then the option prices will reflect that. If you trade a volatile stock, you will collect more for the risk you are taking, in the end, balancing things out.
