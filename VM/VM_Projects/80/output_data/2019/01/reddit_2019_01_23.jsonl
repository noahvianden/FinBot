They were actually starting to generate a lot of operating cash flow around 2006. Their net cash flow and net income was still low for many years after that, because of those investments. They didn't worry about hoarding cash or generating profits because they were managing their cash flow well, which meant putting the available cash to good use. So they also didn't need capital raises (after a point), or fund their operations with preorder deposits.\n\nTesla isn't making the same margins or operating cashflow from their car sales, the bears are waiting for their financials to catch up with them. And they are consistently behind on their promises to build new service centers and superchargers (hmmm I wonder why?) That's not to say Tesla will automatically fail, bears could be making a mistake in analyzing Tesla's financials as well.
