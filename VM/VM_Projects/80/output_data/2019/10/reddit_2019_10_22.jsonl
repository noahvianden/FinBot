I feel quite confident that if these were Obama numbers I\u2019m citing I\u2019d be getting a different response.  Comparing Boston to Green Bay?  What?  Yes of course certain local markets are different than others , that is more a reflection of local politics.  For example, my local Illinois and Chicago economies are dying and billions upon billions of dollars in debt despite huge tax rates under Democratic leadership, while my neighboring my neighboring state Indiana with more Rebuplican leadership and much lower taxes finished this year with a record budget surplus and budget reserves in the billions. Regardless, when judging NATIONAL politics and presidents you obviously can\u2019t take local political numbers, you take the NATIONAL aggregates and that\u2019s how we\u2019ve always judged presidential economies. You can\u2019t nitpick midstream if the numbers don\u2019t suit your agenda. \n\nBigger picture, both employment and wages for low and middle income families are markedly up while their taxes and inflation rates are  down.  Those are basic facts not subject to dispute to anyone being honest with themselves. \n\nTrump has some significant issues no doubt, but trying to nitpick the economy under him is futile and silly, and really just reflects biases trying to pick an argument where none rationally exists.

The BLS (the one the government uses to come up with those inflation numbers) uses the CPI as one of their primary instruments to calculate inflation (here are the others if you're bored -  [https://www.bls.gov/bls/inflation.htm](https://www.bls.gov/bls/inflation.htm)). CPI, like I said does not use home prices in the calculation, which makes it a misleading metric when talking about price increases. So the goods from China cost went down, but housing cost went up by a huge amount and averaged together they supposedly level out? Yeah I don't think so. I purely was stating I don't agree with inflation as a metric for how well or bad an economy is doing or how much or how little people have in their pocket.  \n\nI could give two shits about what the numbers are under Trump, if just looking in the last 10 years yes wages have gone up but so has the cost of housing, and its outpaced wages by a lot. I think you'd find the trends tend to lag a couple of years so I'll wait to pass judgement in 2022 if the current administration's policies were good or bad. \n\nOn a side note I'm not real happy with any of my choices. I'd like if the US invested in infrastructure vs. huge tax cuts, most of that money just ends up either as stock buybacks or in the hands of a few shareholders. I'd also prefer if there was a public option for health care, while also keeping private insurance.
