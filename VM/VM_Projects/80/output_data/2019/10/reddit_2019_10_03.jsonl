{"title": "Estimates for Tesla's 2020 deliveries", "selftext": "You all are welcome to post yours. Here's mine:\n\n**550,000** total deliveries in 2020.\n\n* **120k** deliveries of SR+ **Model 3**s produced in **GF3.**\n* **270k** deliveries of **Model 3**s produced in **Fremont**. This is significantly lower compared to the current run rate of 320k. I'm accounting for reduction in China deliveries for Fremont-made cars, and cannibalization because of Model Y. This decline will be offset by expansion into new markets, riding down the Model 3 demand curve with lower prices and riding up the general trend of EV adoption.\n* **100k** **Model Y**'s. I'm assuming that they'll begin Model Y production in June 2020 and be able to cut the time to cumulative 100k cars in half of what they took for Model 3.\n* **60k** **S&X**. This is despite my expectations of interior and battery pack refresh by early Q1 2020. This may seem too conservative but I believe Model Y will cannibalize a significant chunk of Model X sales.\n* To hit the Fremont estimates they'll need **\\~30 GWh** of total Panasonic cells from GF1 in 2020 assuming that S&X cells will also be sourced from GF1 for major part of 2020. This is quite feasible considering their plan to hit the theoretical-max of  35 GWh by some time in early 2020.", "id": "dcvz2v", "created_utc": 1570131726.0, "score": 23, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 83, "comments": [{"body": "I hope Tesla will guide next year conservatively, then solidly beat quarter after quarter.\n\nThere is no benefit by guiding high, then miss it.

My point is we are talking numbers here in thread as entire basis for subject, and the thesis isn't matching as every time I mention there's a problem with scaling it's being contradicted with \"well this is *very special non human engineering which is unreproducible*\". Even as a Tesla owner himself, it just comes off very much like cognitive dissonance.\n\nAlso: nobody was arguing for traditional auto. Just the idea of mass manufacturing a proven concept, even if it is new. This is not unique to traditional auto at all, and they are not using many materials *not* found in other products on Earth (unlike Space X, which is just a ridiculous comparison considering).\n\nAlso FYI: Before Ford, in the late 1800s/early 1900*, EVs were pretty much the only cars used.  Not to say these were better obviously, but this EV koolaid stuff is a bit ridiculous and not a legitimate scientific argument as to why they can't scale their already existing manufacturing process further at existing plants. \n\nTraditional auto have an infrastructure that is made for oil and gas, and they make billions daily on a literal basis by NOT making EVs look good (and preferably not even noticable). This was mentioned earlier in thread. This answers the last question in reply, which is \"they have an incentive not to\", and not because they would not be able to scale. In terms of the battery, there are many companies such as LG Chem which do work with the existing auto industry.
