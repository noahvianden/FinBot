{"title": "The case for Dividend Growth Investing", "selftext": "Hello everyone, \n\nI am a dividend growth investor, and I wanted to offer my perspective on dividend growth stocks and dividend (growth) investing as a strategy. \n\nI know many of you will have seen contrasting videos from Ben Felix and PPCIan on youtube on this topic. My purpose for posting is that I want to spark a broad discussion of the strategy and on dividends in general. \n\nIn my view, it\u2019s a truly incredible strategy. \n\nFor some context, I began trading awhile back, just about breaking even overall. When I started to invest in blue chip dividends stocks geared towards strong free cash flow and dividend growth, I started to see some growth in my portfolio, and that growth will continue whether the market dips or rises. \n \nIf the market rises, obviously share price will increase and I\u2019m still collecting dividends. With DRIP (dividend reinvestment plan), I gain fractional shares and eventually full shares of the companies I own. By investing for ownership of the company (very long term) your wealth will snowball over time. \n\nIf the market falls, you\u2019ll appear to lose money on the share price, but it\u2019s actually a blessing in disguise. When the market falls, most blue chip stocks go on sale and trade at more favorable valuations. Additionally, since the market price is cheaper, you\u2019ll accumulate shares quicker using dividend reinvestment. It\u2019s automated dollar cost averaging. When the market becomes more bullish, the value of your shares will increase rapidly on top of the dividend income you\u2019re receiving steadily. \n\nThe only situation where you\u2019re selling is when a company you own cuts it\u2019s dividend or eliminates it entirely. If you keep holding for decades, your wealth will compound at a rapid rate. The more time you are invested, the more wealth you will create. \n\nBy investing in companies with strong balance sheets, free cash flow and dividend growth, you can create enormous wealth. By doing solid dd and fundamental analysis, you\u2019ll be investing in great companies at favorable valuations. Additionally, dividend increases signal that management is confident in the business and confident that they\u2019ll be able to maintain a higher payout. \n\nSome things you should avoid are companies with yield traps (companies with high dividend yields to keep investors roped in), companies with high payout ratios (I personally like to avoid companies with over 75% payout ratio) and companies that take on a lot of debt (hurts free cash flow). \n\nThe best part is that you never have to sell the shares that you own. You can live off your dividends in retirement AND pass ownership onto your kids. \n\nThe passive income generated by dividends is life changing. The process requires discipline and it\u2019s not sexy \u2014 time matters and it\u2019s a key component.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in learning more about this strategy, please head over to r/dividends or r/dividend_investing to learn more and check out PPCIan on YouTube. I\u2019m also happy to answer questions if you pm me. \n\nHappy investing!", "id": "dj6zy2", "created_utc": 1571321770.0, "score": 80, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 80, "comments": [{"body": "Excellent post, thanks for sharing.

But, from what I know, it is so much more than the math that you're talking about. \n\nForcing somethings stock price to depreciate like that just makes the stock look more attractive to investors because it more consistently goes on sale and has better price valuation ratios. This \"attractiveness\" adds value and drives the price up which pretty much negates the depreciation in the first place. This is because when you're crunching numbers regarding a stock that has lost 5%/yr historically due to dividend payments, the price metrics will look more favourable. \n\nFor example Company 1 is $10, doesnt pay a dividend and the stock price grows 60 cents per year due to good earnings and people generally liking the name. Theoretically if in those years, it paid a 60 cent dividend instead, the stock price would be flat right? NO, due to the fact it had good earnings (which aren't affected by dividend payments) and people are attracted to the name, the stock price will still appreciate and you get those dividend payments on TOP of it.\n\nFor this reason, dividends cannot be compared to forced withdrawals.

Your point is also the reason I try to stay away from tech stocks that pay dividends.. but thats just me I guess. \n\nAlso for DGI, a company is supposed to increase their dividend while they grow as a company. This allows for discrepency between dividend yield and a shareholders yield on cost. Meaning if a company pays a 3% dividend, but you bought it years ago and they increased their dividend a bunch since then, then when the company depreciates 3% to pay you, you actually get paid 5% of your investment due to all the dividend increases since you purchased it.
