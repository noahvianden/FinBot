I want the economy to collapse. As an IT guy, it makes the entire economy more efficient when larger, overly complex companies go bust, so it's a double win. Plus, it'd be nice if these fucking boomers would retire en masse, but they generally can't because only 25% of them saved *anywhere near the amount of they they would need to retire*. I believe the ballpark percentage is that 8% of American adults have saved enough for a \"comfortable\" retirement, but that likely doesn't include skyrocketing healthcare costs.\n\n>5) Please go to your local Barnes and Nobles and find a book that is going to teach you some real fundamentals about the economy. Learning from Yahoo news and professing your retardation and shiny tin hat mentality will get you no where in life.\n\n*cracks neck*\n\nOK, here we go.\n\n80% of retirees would be bankrupt without social security.\n\nU3 doesn't include people that have stopped looking for work, nor does it include people that have been looking for longer than 6 months. U6 does.\n\nGDP numbers come straight from the treasury. They will not give you a line by line process of how they come up with their numbers.\n\nBLS unemployment numbers come from a voluntary, nonverified survey of 142,000 business, even though there are at *least* 30 million \"businesses\", although that number includes at least 15 million LLCs. The only record that the feds have of an LLC is the EIN, unless they specifically go looking for it. Overseas corporations? That requires going through the legal system to request documents, and many countries will basically laugh in the face of the US feds.\n\nThe average amount of wealth for a black family is $16k. The average amount of wealth for a white family is $104k.\n\nDuring the 2008 financial crisis, we didn't find out that the Treasury had secretly loaned $7 trillion out to the banks, on *top* of the $700 billion in TARP money that Congress approved. We didn't find this out until 2012, due to a Supreme Court decision.\n\nMilitary spending, according to the military's own reports, is at least 3% of GDP. However, they use the bullshit treasury numbers, and the military has literally never completed a complete audit, because such a task is almost physically impossible, and practically politically impossible. Fun fact: until Edward Snowden leaked the NSA's budget, people thought it was ~$7 billion. It was around ~$70 billion, and that was in 2013. \n\nHealthcare spending. Oh boy. So between the feds propping up the majority of rural hospitals because most people are too poor to pay the bullshit arbitrary rates that hospitals charge, the medicare+medicaid fraud, reinsurance, and the racket that the FDA is running, American healthcare is fucking god awful.\n\nHousing. So, from my estimation, the reason rents are so high and valuations are higher is because of the following reasons:\n\n1) Lots of overseas illegally funneled money, particularly from LLCs that don't have identification about who owns/controls them\n\n2) Rents seem to only go *up*, despite the economy for most people being either static or people finding it harder and harder to get \"well paying\" jobs. My theory is that the landlords are exaggerating the maintenance costs by 10x on their business income taxes, if not fraudulently valuing their property in the first place.\n\nAfter all, there are only 12,000 IRS agents for the entire country, the majority of audits are done on people that make less $60k (they generally settle within 2 years). Oh, and apparently the IRS' policy is that if you drag out the situation for longer than 7 years, they'll settle for 10% of the amount.\n\nThis only works because federal judges basically never hold white collar criminals in contempt, as for some retarded reason, \"intent\" can't be easily proved, or at least that's what the jurisprudence says, despite everyone knowing that you should pay your taxes.\n\n3) Zoning and HOAs are rackets. There's no incentive to innovate, because there's constant demand and the zoning cartels \"control\" the supply. There's some nuance here, as Houston's zoning situation is ridiculous, but in general, cities and towns are controlled by wealthy landowners. That hasn't changed since humanity invented housing.\n\nI've listened to *every* episode of Planet Money. I know what the harmonized tariff schedule is, I know how bond yields and bond demands work, I know what the SWYFT system is, I know what tranches are, what CDOs are, what mortgage backed securities are, how options work, what the business cycle is, the relationship between CPI and inflation, what makes up the \"basket of goods\", what core inflation is, etc. I'm a bear. I have to know my enemy - bubbles - to know how, and more importantly, *when* to make bets against the economy. \n\nSpeaking of which, we just found out about the open loop sulfur emissions cheating on 4,000+ ships in international shipping, that should be an interesting scandal.\n\nOh, and IMO, oil should run out by 2045, at least the stuff that comes out of the ground. Biodiesel will likely become the replacement, but you don't just replace 100 *million* barrels of oil a day overnight. Making specialty oils and greases will become exceedingly expensive.\n\n>6) weird note, but what does account maturity time and karmas have anything to do with this conversation?\n\nGenerally the batshit crazy posters have newer accounts, say, 1 month of age.
