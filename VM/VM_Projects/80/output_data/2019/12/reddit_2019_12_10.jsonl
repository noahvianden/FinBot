Dont get me wrong, this stock is the definition of \"uninvestable\".  800k in revenue for a 1.9 billion dollar valuation? \n\nIve decided ima do 50/50 straddles on this dumpster fire for a few reasons.  \n\nIm aware this stock is awful, but its small enough and ambitious enough where rich guys are gonna constantly mess with the price.  \n\n1.  3 analyst price targets all over 20$.  0 hold.  0 sell.  Im aware only 3 analysts and theyre all less than reputable, but again, rich dudes, low market cap.  Plus idiots are gonna see this garbage and be like \"3 BUY RATINGS ALL OVER $20!!! FREE MONEY!\".  im just being realistic.  This stock has been around for like 3 years and barely moved till the past month when suddenly 3 analysts decided to pump it.  \n\n2.  Its getting nothing but positive media coverage, and significantly more of it now.  Cnbc literally said.  Erghm.  Eh hem.  Hmph.  Erghm.  \n\nLast week, Virgin Galactic CEO George Whitesides said 2019 was marked by \u201cmilestone after milestone,\n\nFollowed by nothing but under the table handys aimed at pumping this bad boy.  \n\n3.  They recieved $450 million in funding for their IPO 2.5 years ago.  Their current valuation is less than their IPO so someone thinks their assets are worth something.  And to be fair, revenue is up 110% yoy.  And they built a factory in new mexico and some other useless shit.  \n\n4. Rich dudes have already loaded up BIG time on calls for June 2020 and january 2021 around the same time the pt happend.  \n\n\nNone of this is to say it deserves an ounce of that billion dollar valuation, only that theres gonna continue being monster price action and heavy manipulation.  Then one day people will think its the next tsla or something dumb.  \n\nAs of tommorrow, ima hold these puts in the morning to see what happens then buy some calls for well into next year and rake in some manipulation tendies.  Again.  This.  Stock.  Is.  Ass.  But itll still go up.\n\nEdit:  unless we go into a recession then this thing is going outta business next week, but ima play the straddles game in the mean time.\n\nEdit2:  no u\n\nEdit3:  the amount of 13 year olds with 30$ in paper trading losing their minds about a shitpost over some dumpster fire stock is unreal.
