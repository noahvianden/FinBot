It is a self-inflicted liability, since Elon has just been way too optimistic about it. Yes, the FSD computer in HW3 is unique. Nobody has as much real world data as Tesla. And their approach to FSD is the right one (no lidar). But nevertheless there is no good reason to think that FSD is around the corner. It will just take an endless amount of time to straighten out all corner cases, some will never be resolved, and, most importantly, new ones will pop up all the time.

However, I also agree that his robotaxi goal is way off and too optimistic because that requires a high-safety level 5, which is a huge leap from L4. \n\nI don\u2019t know if Elon is knowingly overestimating the ability of HW3, but my feeling is that HW3 is only adequate for level 4 partly due to the low fidelity cameras. The cameras are currently running at 1280x960 which is lower than 2k/HD. Lower fidelity makes it harder to discern stationary objects (one thing Tesla autopilot has been often criticized for). My theory is that this lower fidelity is what necessitates Lidar at the early stages. \n\nThe leap from L4 to L5 is so staggeringly huge that I think Tesla will need something closer to 4K cameras at 120fps or higher and a new HW4 chip capable of processing that data to achieve L5. I think that\u2019s when computer vision will win the Lidar debate hands down. \n\nSo while Tesla has a huge data advantage, I think a future hardware upgrade is necessary to achieve level 5 and robotaxi. \n\nElon has also repeatedly said that FSD price will increase a lot in the future. I think he is pricing in the costs of the ultimate upgrade to HW4 and better cameras when he says this. \n\nSo I expect another autonomy presentation in late 2021 where Elon will unveil HW4 with upgraded cameras which will first be deployed in his robotaxi fleet. This may include camera management hardware to maintain clear camera vision at all times. Perhaps this rollout will be called a hardware 4 upgrade suite or something. \n\nElon will likely announce late 2022, early 2023 deployment. actual deployment of first robotaxis with L5 will likely be 2024.
