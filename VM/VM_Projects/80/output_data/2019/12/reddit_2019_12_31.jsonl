His top call: \u201cApple will be the best performing FAANG stock in 2019.\u201d He nailed it, and sees five reasons Apple stock will continue rising.\n\nOne year ago, Loup Ventures founder Gene Munster and his colleagues laid out a set of tech predictions for 2019. His top call: \u201cApple will be the best performing FAANG stock in 2019.\u201d\n\nHe nailed it: As we near year-end, Apple stock (ticker: AAPL) has rallied 86% year to date, well ahead of the other FAANGs: Facebook stock (FB) has rallied 59%; Amazon.com stock (AMZN), 24%; Netflix stock (NFLX), 23%; and Alphabet stock (GOOGL) (G as in Google), 30%.\n\nWhile he\u2019s lately been investing in startups, Munster built his reputation earlier in his career as an equity analyst covering Apple stock, generally bullishly, at Piper Jaffray.\n\nMunster\u2019s call on Apple\u2019s big 2019 not only got the stock right\u2014he also correctly called what drove the stock higher: A new focus on services, a better position than rivals on regulatory issues, and investor anticipation of 5G iPhones in 2020 and beyond.\n\nYep, Munster nailed it this year, and he\u2019s going for it again.\n\nLast week, Munster and Loup rolled out a set of predictions for 2020. And it starts with this one: \u201cApple is our pick for top performing FAANG stock in 2020.\u201d He thinks fair value for Apple stock is in the $350 to $400 range, which implies a potential gain of more than 30%. On Monday, the stock is down about 1% at $286.79.\nMunster offers five reasons he thinks the stock will keep rolling in 2020.\n\nEasy iPhone comparisons: He thinks Apple is likely to meet or exceed analyst expectations in three of the four quarters of 2020 based on easy iPhone comparisons \u2014 he notes that iPhone sales were down year-over-year in all four quarters of fiscal 2019. He thinks iPhone will account for 20% of Apple\u2019s revenue in fiscal 2020.\n\nWearables: Munster says Apple\u2019s wearables sales will be larger than those for the Mac in 2020, driven by a new version of the AirPod with better battery life and continued growth for Apple Watch. There\u2019s also the launch of a much-anticipated product called Apple Tags, which Munster says will attach to keys, wallets and other things to keep track of their locations. He sees wearables sales up 45% in 2020, driven primarily by AirPods and Apple Watch. \u201cBeyond 2020, Apple Watch has significant room to grow, given that global Apple Watch adoption remains nascent,\u201d he writes. \u201cWe expect 20%-30% Apple Watch unit growth for the next five years.\u201d He thinks that by 2025, Apple Watch sales can reach $48 billion, or about 12% of Apple\u2019s overall revenue.\n\nNew iPhone Models: Munster expects five new iPhone models in 2020, versus three new models in each of the last two years. All eyes are on the expected 5G launches in late 2020.\n\nInvestors Await 5G: Munster made this forecast a year ago, and updates it this time. \u201c5G will be the biggest iPhone upgrade cycle since 2015, which benefited from the first full year of the larger-screen iPhone 6,\u201d he writes. \u201cLong term, we believe the 5G cycle can deliver two years of 10% iPhone revenue growth, compared to our expectation of iPhone revenue essentially flat in calendar 2020. That said, the iPhone 5G cycle will hit full stride in 2022 and 2023. We expect the product\u2019s first full year (2021) to disappoint investors due to lack of 5G coverage from wireless carriers, which will act as a governor on iPhone 5G adoption.\u201d\n\nMultiple Expansion: \u201cWe expect AAPL\u2019s earnings multiple to increase in 2020,\u201d he writes. \u201cInvestors will begin to recognize Apple\u2019s combination of hardware and services as a high-visibility and sticky business. The prevailing investor view is that shares of AAPL should be undervalued relative to peers based on a belief that the company\u2019s risk profile is relatively higher, because 75% of its revenue comes from hardware. Over the past decade, Apple\u2019s results have shown that the combination of hardware, software, and services can deliver earnings, the most important measure of financial strength, that exceed other tech companies with higher multiples. Over the next year, we believe investors will gain confidence in applying a more services-like multiple to AAPL given the hardware business (iPhone and wearables) will deliver revenue visibility similar to traditional services businesses.\u201d\n\nSources: Barron's", "id": "ehv2cf", "created_utc": 1577752944.0, "score": 273, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 87, "comments": [{"body": "Never bet against AAPL especially right now\n\n* AirPod and AirPod Pros keep selling out\n* Apple Watch has no competition \n* iPhone sales keep delivering\n* Apple finally fixed the issues on MacBook Pros and many people that kept their old ones will be upgrading\n* MacPro shut everybody that said Apple didn't care about the pro community anymore\n* Go and look at any Apple store to see people buying like Apple is giving everything for 75% off", "score": 182, "replies": [{"body": "I almost feel like Apple is turning into a cash haven for investors.
