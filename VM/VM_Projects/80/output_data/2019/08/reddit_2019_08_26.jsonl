The underlying isn't volatile, so the implied volatility of the options drop. There aren't any direct consequences for the underlying, just that the value of all TSLA options declined today. When the underlying is very volatile there is a higher chance that options will hit their strike price, so they are worth more. If TSLA is flat at 211-215 for many days, then it's stable and the options have a lower probability of hitting their strike so the value declines. This is the effect in practice today. Trading options, in its simplest form, is betting on volatility.\n\nAnother way to look at IV is how expensive options are. In the Black Scholes model IV is merely a plug to arrive at an option's current value, defined as what market participants are willing to pay. If more buyers demand options the IV increases and the opposite is true, too. Of the 5 inputs to the Black Scholes model let's assume 4 inputs are held constant while IV is the dynamic variable. If you are willing to pay $3 per call option, then IV might compute as 40%, but if you are willing to pay $4 per call option then the IV must be higher, perhaps it computes as 45%.
