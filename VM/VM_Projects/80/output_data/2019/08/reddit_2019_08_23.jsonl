{"title": "is toothpaste a buy right now?", "selftext": "With the bond yield curve inverting many investors are wary of an equity sell off which would eventually result in a huge personal loss for many investors who's portfolios are heavy in stocks right now. I think most people should stay in the market for the long term but for those seeking a temporary safe guard for volatility I think toothpaste may be a buy right now as we may head into a global economic slow-down. here are the reasons listed that toothpaste may drastically increase in value over the next decade:\n\n1. It is a commodity and doesn't go bad, so hoarding toothpaste is in some ways, a shield against inflation. And since the demand for hygiene is so high, this could be considered a highly liquid asset. Toothpaste is bought by almost every consumer in the U.S weekly. The top 10 brands of toothpaste in the U.S collectively sell over 550 million units each year.\n2. The market has bottomed out, a new health related article on fox news indicates that approximately 33% of young people only brush their teeth once a day ( [https://www.foxnews.com/health/one-third-of-millennials-brush-teeth-just-once-a-day-study-shows#targetText=Research%20commissioned%20by%20Hello%20Products,at%20least%20once%20a%20day.](https://www.foxnews.com/health/one-third-of-millennials-brush-teeth-just-once-a-day-study-shows#targetText=Research%20commissioned%20by%20Hello%20Products,at%20least%20once%20a%20day.) ). I personally would consider this a market bottom-out and think that there's a lot of potential for increased brushing in the next decade which would result in higher demand for toothpaste. ( [https://imgur.com/a/6KNN2Y3](https://imgur.com/a/6KNN2Y3) ). This  is corroborated by the theory that while millennial consumers are brushing their teeth less, they are becoming more health conscious ( [https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/timi-gustafson/younger-consumers-are-mor\\_b\\_14290774.html](https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/timi-gustafson/younger-consumers-are-mor_b_14290774.html) ). There could be a breaking point where many young people come to a realization about their dental hygiene habits which would be a breakthrough for the commodities market (and specifically tooth paste).\n\nWith all things considered, I could realistically see toothpaste getting a 5-20% return over the next decade and possibly even beat the S&P 500 if everything goes as expected. I personally am buying all the toothpaste I can get to shield my portfolio from the next recession.
