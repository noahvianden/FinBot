I heard you have problems holding on to your options because of fear of wasting assets/ time decay. This is also known as theta.\n\nSo, let's take a moment to understand theta. First, time decay accelerates as the contract nears expiration.  Second, when it comes to pricing options, theta can be a pro. For example, if you are writing an option and then it decays, it will be cheaper to close your position because of time decay.\n\nThere are a few Greeks such as delta, gamma, and everyone's favorite vega. They all play a part in option pricing. So, yes you will lose money every day as you hold a long position with your calls or puts, but there are plenty of other factors at play here.\n\nI'm not going to go into too much detail, but if you are buying options and you are here, you're trying to make money off the premiums. If you are worried about losing money, you might want to use a debit spreads to help mitigate risk. Next, try buying contracts with longer expiration dates. Again, time decay will occur slowly if there is more time on the contract. This gives the opportunity for gamma, delta, and vega to make up for the waste. Remember, your contract doesn't always have to be ITM to make money. Oracle 60 calls were profitable when the company went through earnings and pushed over 55. Now, you had to buy them before the volatility to take advantage of this sudden vega since the stock had been neutral for so long.\n\nIf you are buying options, I would try to buy contracts with more than a month/ at least 60 days with some criteria for that period.\n\nSome ppl like to play the earning game, others try to base it off seasonal/ cyclical factors.
