First people complained that they hadn\u2019t set funds aside. Now they do, and people complain more. Good god. The families lit Boeing up with lawsuits from day 1. They should be suing the airlines\n\n\nThe fact that Lion Air is still operating blows my mind. The maintenance is horrible, they even knew the sensor was faulty and failed to fix it 3 times. If I recall the flight before the actual crash, almost crashed. But they ended up landing successfully. Told maintenance about it, and they said it was fine. It goes up again and we know how the rest goes. \n\nEthiopia Air, on the other hand definitely had a faulty sensor as well, probably for the same reason. Whether or not the maintenance knew of it, is the question. But what I do know is that those pilots lacked basic tools for flying. They did properly address the issue, they identified it correctly. And they would have been okay if they let the switches cut out and kept their speed in check. They ignored the overspeed warning for many minutes and any pilot knows that\u2019s unacceptable to ignore your speed while dealing with control issues. THEY NEEDED TO SLOW DOWN, just like anyone else dealing with a runaway stab situation. Perhaps this is a result of Airlines taking advantage of technology and rarely training pilots anymore. Ethiopia had a Max8 sim. The co pilot, who was young, and had 200+ hours, hadn\u2019t logged one hour or minute in it. Hmmmm \n\n\nI\u2019m a pilot, I fly the 777, I just came from flying the 737, I\u2019m very familiar with Boeing aircrafts, and I do know that pilots do not need to know of mcas, all they need to know is that the aircraft is making an unwanted downward pitch, and that\u2019s it. The procedures for this are the same as any other runaway stab. Autopilot or any other system can malfunction, and improperly handling the situation will result the same. This is why the media reported that the class for the Max was only an hour on a iPad. Because pilots have already learned the hard part. Once you\u2019re typed into the 737, let\u2019s say you begin at 737-600. To move up to the 737-800 or anywhere, even down from the 600, it\u2019s typically an hour class. I\u2019ve had some classes that were 30 minutes, taken from home on my cell phone. Boeing keeps these procedures the same for everything, this way it\u2019s a bit easier to transition into another aircraft, and pilots won\u2019t hear about all the other procedures that are different, but from the same issue, amongst other aircrafts. You\u2019ll hear the same procedure for just about anything unless you\u2019re talking with a pilot who\u2019s typed in an Airbus or something else. Sensors do not crash a flight, and Airbus already proved that. In 2008 an A320 equipped with 3 AoA sensors, had a similar accident. At cruising altitude, 2 AoA sensors failed, the 2 rejected the 3rd sensor. That flight ultimately crashed and killed everyone on board. The pilots were still at fault because they handled the situation incorrectly. This is why Boeing didn\u2019t add more sensors, and it\u2019s why airlines refused to purchase more as a safety feature. If technology fails on an aircraft, it\u2019s probably best to not rely on it anymore. It\u2019s not safe. \n\nBut like I said, the media is playing this out like pilots were surprised at this situation. No. This situation is not new, it happens for all sorts of reasons. The crew knew exactly what they dealing with. They said it was AoA related, that it was a trim. And they hit the cut out switches. They would be alive today if they left it cut out. Boeing\u2019s procedures clearly state to leave the switches cut out for remainder of the flight. The captain went against it because he couldn\u2019t get autopilot to connect. Turning on a failed system is not a pilots job. At times you have to face the reality of remembering everything you\u2019ve learned and manually fly this aircraft. The captain was desperate to get autopilot back on, he tried about 6 times unsuccessfully, while the F/O told him nothing worked. They couldn\u2019t get the answers they were looking for, all because of their speed. And it\u2019s another reason why they couldn\u2019t recover from the last pitch. The crew was not baffled or snowed by mysterious elements that they didn\u2019t understand. The aircraft was flyable, and the situation was entirely preventable. I feel bad for everyone involved. Especially the passengers who probably thought it was being done on purpose.", "score": 21, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Let me edit this in. Runaway stabilizer procedures in the 737 have remained pretty much unchanged since its first flight. The same can be said for pretty much any Boeing airliner.\n\n1 - Turn off the autopilot to see if it's causing the problem.\n\n2 - Oppose the trim manually with the yoke. If that stops it, you're done.\n\n3 - If that doesn't work, then you turn off the stab trim cutout switches.\n\nIf MCAS is getting some kind of erroneous AOA signal and inputting an unwanted nose down pitch, guess what? Those procedures will stop it. If pilots at airline X get to step 2 and think they're good and MCAS starts another input after it's initial 10 second trim, then they go to step 3\n\nIt is easy for me to say, because I\u2019ve dealt with control issues at much lower altitude than that, I\u2019m talking barely over 1,000.  \n\nTo prevent any further confusion ill carefully explain this. MCAS has no more potential for catastrophic consequences than the basic stab trim system or autopilot control on a 737-200 in 1967. Any of those systems can malfunction and the results of an IMPROPERLY handled malfunction would be the same. Boeing's not going to add \"If the failure is determined to be MCAS, then blah, blah, blah........ to the Runaway Stabilizer procedures because it doesn't matter. The symptoms and solution of some kind of MCAS failure are basically the same as any other stab related malfunction. A pilot wouldn't need to know why his aircraft was pitching down uncommanded - just that it is and there are long established, proven procedures that he's supposed to follow.\n\nTrim runs when unwanted, there are two cutoff switches, easily accessible, and trim isn't subtle or unseen in the 737. It's very obvious. It's noisy, it's very visual, and it's tactile. There is NO doubt that the trim is moving, and if that's happening without the autopilot engaged and the pilot isn't trimming, there can only be one possibility, and one solution. \n\nAllowing it to happen repeatedly, no excuse. Cutting it off, then reversing that action to enable trim again, also inexcusable. Accelerating to 600+ KIAS, beyond excusable, very controllably the entire time. \n\nTwo similar incidents in third-world countries, with at least one FO at a ridiculously low experience level, flying the aircraft.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": ">Let me edit this in.

Ethiopia had a Max8 sim and the FO with only a few hundred hours never spent a minute in it. How\u2019d the pilot save lion airs flight before the crash? From the basic procedure. They also knew what the sensor was doing. They knew of it and failed to fix it 3 times. Ethiopia had thrust set to take off, due to the climb on take off. But they weren\u2019t climbing. They were dealing with control issues. Should have reduced thrust. They knew exactly what they were dealing with. They said it was AoA related. That it was trim. They verbalized this. Understand if you can: they diagnosed it correctly. But they went against procedures by putting the switches back which Boeing clearly highlights that you shouldn\u2019t.

They initially hit them, they didn\u2019t deal with mcas after that, they dealt with control issues and allowed the overspeed warning to impact for over 3 minutes.

But if they did, wouldn\u2019t ya think the training in a 737 would be fairly easy and not forgotten if it was so common? Boeing rarely trains pilots. You can get your type ratings for a 737 at many independent schools. And it\u2019s probably the best choice to do so if you\u2019re paying out of pocket. Airlines will often get you typed in an aircraft, but all the training is through them. I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019ve noticed. But with the 747 being phased out, mostly used for cargo because that\u2019s the only place the airlines will turn a profit using the 747. The A380 was a huge mistake by airbus. Airlines do not want bigger aircrafts. Hence why the 787 and 777 have become so popular. The fuel is efficient and they ideally get enough passengers in them. Look at how much a 747 holds and then compare to a 787. They\u2019re cramming people in these \u201cwide body\u201d aircrafts. Right now the airlines want the most fuel efficient aircraft, and that\u2019s the Neo and 737. The amount of fuel it saves, plus the extra capacity is making them a lot of money. Or you can buy anything bigger than the 787 and you\u2019re probably not making much. There\u2019s only so much fuel you can save with a typical capacity rating. Aircrafts have also gotten expensive. Due to labor costs  and cost of technology alone. This has sent prices through the roof. It makes no sense to buy a 747 or an A380. What you\u2019ll see from this, is more smaller aircrafts, which save a lot more fuel. Take a look at airline stocks. They\u2019re not doing much, thanks to many cheap airlines, who originally came in doing it cheap as possible, other airlines had to lower prices to keep up. Now we have this situation. Airlines are taking the bare minimum while taking on such a huge demand. They try so hard to keep up which usually results in them going bankrupt.
