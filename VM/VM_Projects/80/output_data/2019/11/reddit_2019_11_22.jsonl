Not long after his visit, Amazon led a US$700 million investment in Rivian. Two months later, in April, Ford Motor invested US$500 million. All told, Rivian has raised US$1.7 billion without selling a single truck or SUV.\n\nIf you have not heard of Rivian before, that was intentional. Until recently, it was in stealth mode, operating out of unmarked buildings and making few public announcements. But no longer. By the end of 2020, Rivian intends to begin producing premium electric vehicles, with a greater range than anything on the road today.\n\nRivian employees describe Scaringe in worshipful, almost mystical tones, echoing the kind of adoration that Musk inspires. Designers laud his sophisticated design sensibilities. Brand experts cite his marketing know-how. \"\n\nhttps://business.financialpost.com/transportation/autos/rivian-founder-quietly-builds-a-tesla-for-trucks-and-suvs", "id": "e07tdy", "created_utc": 1574458683.0, "score": 83, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 81, "comments": [{"body": "That's an ecstasy pill on wheels", "score": 52, "replies": [{"body": "Needs some dancing hamsters in it", "score": 16, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2510842978954315}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.09161431342363358}, {"body": "If you have not done so please take the time to watch the unveiling of Cybertruck this morning.  if I was an evil mastermind who created a company just so I could short the shares, I would not have been able to achieve the level of incompetence that Musk showed the investing world on stage.", "score": 57, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 23, "replies": [{"body": "He's worth $20,000,000,000.

The CEO is a mechanical engineer, with a pretty singular focus, who seems to be levelheaded and not prone to \"hype\". Even the way he talks about batteries/charging is a stark contrast to the oft-exaggerated claims of other builders. \n\n2. The \"skateboard\" is modular and designed to be sold/licensed to other manufacturers as a drivetrain, so it's a revenue source not dependent on \"Rivian\" trucks selling. This also limits the effect of problems in later manufacturing stages, like the fitment issues Tesla has had.\n\n3. The plant is in old-school auto mfg territory, and staffed with employees with tons of auto experience. \n\n4. Amazon needs LOTS of vehicles, and they want to go electric. Buying partly-from-themselves makes perfect sense. Ford needs a badass electric platform for their F150s, buying partly-from-themselves makes perfect sense, and apparently they liked what they saw with Rivian. \n\nAnd these are just the factors WE can see--obviously there are tons more we can't that influenced these investments. Not just Ford and Amazon, either--Sumitomo is a huge player, with divisions in chemicals, rubber, heavy machinery, electrical equipment, finance (financing availability is a HUGE deal for trying to sell cars) and mining. Cox Automotive is also in, who own AutoTrader, Kelley Blue Book, Mannheim Transportation (which ships vehicles all over the country), and DealerTrack.  The vertical integrations with these companies offer a TON of opportunities to leverage existing successful processes. Not to mention Standard Chartered Bank *loaned* them $200m, with the expectation of them succeeding and being able to pay it back, I assume. \n\nThat's a whole lot of money from quite a few major players with extensive resources and experience.
