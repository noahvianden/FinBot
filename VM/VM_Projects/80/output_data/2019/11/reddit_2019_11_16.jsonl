{"title": "Tesla lies to you.", "selftext": "They make almost as much from regulatory credits as they do from cars and sell those credits at specific times to inflate numbers. They game warranty cost figures to boost numbers at specific times. They do lots of other shit to make individual quarters look good when it matters and blow off quarters when they don't need to raise money right then. \n\nYou love them now because the robbed Peter to pay Paul so they could put out a good quarter for fundraising purposes. They used that good quarter to kick the can on $566 million in debt they paid two weeks ago. Starting in June 2020 they have to pay back another 1.8 billion... Fuck this just go to this link:\n\n https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000156459019038256/tsla-10q_20190930.htm\n\n and scroll to the chart on page 25. \n\nThey have made \"historic\" debt repayments that are only a mere fraction of what they owe in the next 5 years. And their revenue dropped last quarter. Tesla is putting a lot of hope in their Shanghai gigafactory but China is on the verge of a massive housing market crash. That, combined with the effect of unrest in Hong Kong and the general uncertainty that produces for foreign investment, oh and lets not forget their fucking pigs are dying. Chinese people are not going to be looking at buying cars, let alone an expensive novelty car. \n\nTesla can keep pushing off its debt obligations with more debt obligations, but only if they show growth to investors. They game their quarters HARD to make sure that happens, but their time is running out fast. When this happens is anyone's guess, but without a prolonged period of stability in China, and a further prolonged period of stability in the U.S. for the next 5 years, they are going to have a very hard time at it. \n\nI'd say based on when their debt is due, and because of the way they game their quarters, they won't need to raise money to pay anything pressing off until at least December 2020. Expect a mediocre Q4 2019. Probably a marginally shitty Q1 and DOG at Q2 2020. They will be borrowing numbers from Q2 to make Q3 look good. They are going to BLOW UP Q3 and/or Q4 2020 in order to raise the money to pay off 1.3 Billion they owe March of 2021.", "id": "dx0ivp", "created_utc": 1573869222.0, "score": 18, "upvote_ratio": 0.6, "num_comments": 83, "comments": [{"body": "Yada yada yada this pussy has shown us 0 short positions", "score": 84, "replies": [{"body": "Something something market irrational longer than I can keep my dick hard\n\nWait no", "score": 21, "replies": [{"body": "That's kinda the gist of it yeah", "score": 6, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.04289984703063965}, {"body": "\"He's a little confused, but he's got the spirit\"", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1492203325033188}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.25943437218666077}, {"body": "edit: I changed my mind on q4 being a dog.
