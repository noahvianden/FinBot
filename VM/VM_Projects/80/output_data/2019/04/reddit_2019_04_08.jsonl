How it works is that the FAA certifies Boeing, and the European agencies using the FAA guidelines certify the Boeing aircraft in their country.

Whereas the first initial release of a report can cause people to make an emotional trade because they are shocked.\n\nI usually wait a bit for people to continue to make emotional trades.  After this report I'm about to buy in.  Going to wait a bit to see if other institutions follow BofA's report and drop their rating as well.
