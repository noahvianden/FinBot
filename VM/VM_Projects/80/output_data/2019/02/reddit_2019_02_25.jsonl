Once you pass on, the federal student debts in your name are discharged. To receive this discharge, your survivors need to present a certified death certificate to the loan servicer.\n\nIf you have Parent PLUS Loans\n\nParent PLUS borrowers are also eligible for a death discharge, since PLUS loans are federal loans.\n\nFleischman added that for Parent PLUS Loans, it\u2019s the parent \u2014 not the student \u2014 who is legally obligated to repay the loan. \u201cThese loans can be discharged when either the parent or the student dies,\u201d he explained. \u201cDischarged federal student loan obligations won\u2019t pass to your estate, and your heirs won\u2019t have to pay them off.\u201d\n\nRealize, though, that there are tax consequences associated with the death discharge of a Parent PLUS Loan due to the student\u2019s death. Parents receive a 1099-C form from the IRS after the debt is canceled. The remaining debt canceled is treated as taxable income. So parents in this situation could be hit with a large tax bill.\n\nIf you have private student loans\n\nIf you have private student loans, things get a bit trickier. Some private student loan lenders do offer a death discharge, but not all of them.\n\nPrivate student loans, including refinanced loans, are more like traditional personal loans. As with other types of debt, private lenders might come for your estate when you die. However, if the loans are only in your name, your children or other relatives aren\u2019t generally considered liable, according to Credit.com.\n\nIf you have a cosigner\n\nIf your private student loan has a cosigner, which many of them do, you might be in trouble. Your cosigner is legally responsible for your debt after you pass away, regardless of the type of loan in question.
