{"title": "Apple to roll out artificial intelligence features in October ", "selftext": "Apple\u2019s new artificial intelligence features will roll out in October, missing the initial launch of iPhone and iPad software updates, according to a Bloomberg report released on Monday.\n\nThe company split the Apple Intelligence features from the initial iOS launch due to concerns over their stability and need to run tests on a wider scale, the report said. \n\nApple previously said its AI features would be released in a beta version this fall, and they\u2019re expected to help drive sales of Apple\u2019s new iPhones. The features will only work on iPhone 15 Pro models and newer. Some of the promised Apple Intelligence features, such as ChatGPT integration and Siri improvements, are expected to be released later in the year.\n\nApple plans to give developers early access to Apple Intelligence as soon as this week in the iOS 18.1 beta, Bloomberg said.\n\nThe company first announced Apple Intelligence on June 10. The AI features, which will also be available on all Macs and iPads that run the M1 chip or newer, can proofread writing or re-write in a friendly or professional tone, create custom emojis, and summarize and transcribe phone calls. \n\nApple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/29/apple-intelligence-ai-to-release-in-october-report-.html", "id": "1ef04y7", "created_utc": 1722261318.0, "score": 116, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 91, "comments": [{"body": "Call me when autocorrect isn't awful. \n\n  \nThe idea of AI on a smartphone, for doing smartphone tasks, seems like it could be useful?

The features will only work on iPhone 15 Pro models and newer. Some of the promised Apple Intelligence features, such as ChatGPT integration and Siri improvements, are expected to be released later in the year.\n\nApple plans to give developers early access to Apple Intelligence as soon as this week in the iOS 18.1 beta, Bloomberg said.\n\nThe company first announced Apple Intelligence on June 10. The AI features, which will also be available on all Macs and iPads that run the M1 chip or newer, can proofread writing or re-write in a friendly or professional tone, create custom emojis, and summarize and transcribe phone calls. \n\nApple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/29/apple-intelligence-ai-to-release-in-october-report-.html", "id": "1ef04y7", "created_utc": 1722261318.0, "score": 116, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 91, "comments": [{"body": "Call me when autocorrect isn't awful. \n\n  \nThe idea of AI on a smartphone, for doing smartphone tasks, seems like it could be useful?
