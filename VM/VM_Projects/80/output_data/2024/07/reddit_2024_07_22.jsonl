It's also much easier these days to engineer workloads to be extremely fault tolerant, so reliability also doesn't matter for workloads engineered to handle compute node failures, eg a K8s node fails and a cheap technician just replaces the node without any downtime for the workload and without the technician needing to know anything other than how to physically replace the hardware. \n\nI question how common this approach would be outside of massive compute farms, though, and I would speculate that only companies utilizing massive on-prem custom hardware deployments would do this (like Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Amazon).  I work for a company with a six figure on-prem node count, but our stuff is standard Dell and Cisco blade servers and I can't see us doing anything like this.

It's also much easier these days to engineer workloads to be extremely fault tolerant, so reliability also doesn't matter for workloads engineered to handle compute node failures, eg a K8s node fails and a cheap technician just replaces the node without any downtime for the workload and without the technician needing to know anything other than how to physically replace the hardware. \n\nI question how common this approach would be outside of massive compute farms, though, and I would speculate that only companies utilizing massive on-prem custom hardware deployments would do this (like Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Amazon).  I work for a company with a six figure on-prem node count, but our stuff is standard Dell and Cisco blade servers and I can't see us doing anything like this.
