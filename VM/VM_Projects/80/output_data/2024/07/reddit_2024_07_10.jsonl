That same NDX is trading at $20,675 with every major index a cunt hair away from historical highs.

However it\u2019s when the known worry actually implodes that also sinks markets. Do you really think that Michael Burry, Steve Eisman and Greg Lippman over at DB were the only traders that knew how bad the OTC derivatives on the housing market were? I can tell you for a fact that they weren\u2019t because I was trading Institutionally at the time. I first started seeing huge institutional trades in every company that would be affected in mid January of 2007 and by late June 2007 my entire trading desk was aware and what they said in the movie \u201cThe big short\u201d was \u201call you had to do is look\u201d that was absolutely true, all you needed to do is pick up a Bloomberg magazine and read it, there were stories about NINJA loans, people in prison that were buying homes, drive by home appraisals and then there was the $80 trillion dollar OTC market and CMO\u2019s, CDO\u2019s CLO\u2019s and Credit Default Swaps. Everything that happened in that movie was absolutely true, they just changed some names. I had no idea who Michael Burry was but I knew who Steve Eisman and Greg Lippman were. I started shorting Bear Stearns at $138 and shorted it all the way down to the low $20\u2019s, same with Countrywide, New Century, WAMU etc. We all knew but what at least I didn\u2019t know, what didn\u2019t even occur to me is that any of the major banks or Investment firms would actually fail and go to zero. We knew, at least we thought we knew bad it was but we just couldn\u2019t comprehend how much worse by orders of magnitude that it actually was. I remember coming in the Monday after the weekend Merrill Lynch was forced to merge with B of A and that Monday Lehman filed for bankruptcy. There was such a demand for liquidity that I saw Hartford funds moving money market funds at $.96, 10 billion a clip just to prevent a run on the banks. It was one of the scariest and most surreal days of my life. We all stopped trading and the owner of my firm sent every clerk we had to bring back as many cases of beer and liquor they could carry and we all just sat there drinking and watching, listening and talking and there was fear in everyone\u2019s voice. That day we came as close as we ever have to the end of capitalism. Sorry for the rant but I felt like sharing.

Do you really think that Michael Burry, Steve Eisman and Greg Lippman over at DB were the only traders that knew how bad the OTC derivatives on the housing market were? I can tell you for a fact that they weren\u2019t because I was trading Institutionally at the time. I first started seeing huge institutional trades in every company that would be affected in mid January of 2007 and by late June 2007 my entire trading desk was aware and what they said in the movie \u201cThe big short\u201d was \u201call you had to do is look\u201d that was absolutely true, all you needed to do is pick up a Bloomberg magazine and read it, there were stories about NINJA loans, people in prison that were buying homes, drive by home appraisals and then there was the $80 trillion dollar OTC market and CMO\u2019s, CDO\u2019s CLO\u2019s and Credit Default Swaps. Everything that happened in that movie was absolutely true, they just changed some names. I had no idea who Michael Burry was but I knew who Steve Eisman and Greg Lippman were. I started shorting Bear Stearns at $138 and shorted it all the way down to the low $20\u2019s, same with Countrywide, New Century, WAMU etc. We all knew but what at least I didn\u2019t know, what didn\u2019t even occur to me is that any of the major banks or Investment firms would actually fail and go to zero. We knew, at least we thought we knew bad it was but we just couldn\u2019t comprehend how much worse by orders of magnitude that it actually was. I remember coming in the Monday after the weekend Merrill Lynch was forced to merge with B of A and that Monday Lehman filed for bankruptcy. There was such a demand for liquidity that I saw Hartford funds moving money market funds at $.96, 10 billion a clip just to prevent a run on the banks. It was one of the scariest and most surreal days of my life. We all stopped trading and the owner of my firm sent every clerk we had to bring back as many cases of beer and liquor they could carry and we all just sat there drinking and watching, listening and talking and there was fear in everyone\u2019s voice. That day we came as close as we ever have to the end of capitalism. Sorry for the rant but I felt like sharing.
