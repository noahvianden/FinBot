Sometimes there may be investors/traders with more knowledge than you on a particular company and so they will sell their shares because of this insight. Institutional owners that have hundreds of thousands or millions of shares may sell a company's shares because they have found a more profitable investment in another company. In both these scenarios the price of your stock will plummet. You can always buy back the shares of your stock at a 20% discount a month later to avoid wash sales if the stock falls in the short term but rises in the long term. \n\nIf you work at CVS as a pharmacist you can easily see that less people are getting their prescriptions filled there and that there are less retail customers shopping for general merchandise inside the store. If you shop there you would know that as well. That is why stocks will go down despite good fundamentals because there are always others in the stock market that have discovered new information about the company. \n\nPeter Lynch may advocate holding onto losing stocks when the stock price goes down but he also will jump the gun and invest in stocks years before their big price movements. \n\n**The biggest misconception about stocks is that you don't lose until you sell. You are not wrong until you admit failure by selling. When you are a bagholder for years of a stock that has terrible fundamentals you are being childish and not admitting you have failed. When  you admit you have failed and were wrong then you can learn from the experience. When you keep lying to yourself saying the stock will rebound then you should just quit buying individual stocks altogether. The greatest stock market traders and investors know when to cut their losses and accept they have failed and move onto another stock.

{"title": "Recent Intel Gaming Chips have >50% Failure Rate", "selftext": "It has been known for months that Intel's consumer desktop chips of the 13th and 14th generation are widely affected by stability problems. It was thought that these issues were caused by motherboard vendors pushing the chips above the voltage intended by Intel and this was what was causing the chips to fail. [Source](https://videocardz.com/newz/intel-addresses-instability-issues-with-13th-14th-gen-core-k-series-cpus-in-latest-statement)\n\nLast friday some investigative journalism by the youtuber [Level1Techs](https://www.level1techs.com/node/2958) revealed that these issues are not caused by running the chips out of Intel's specifications. He has failure reports from multiple cloud gaming providers which use the relevant chips in large numbers and well within spec. His aggregated data shows a failure rate of 50% per week of continuous running.  [Source](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/13th-and-14th-gen-intel-cpu-instability-also-hits-servers) , [Further Reading](https://semiwiki.com/forum/index.php?threads/intel-13th-and-14th-gen-core-i9-stability-problems.20614/)\n\n\nI'm mostly making this post because I have not seen this being reported on outside of niche tech circles.
