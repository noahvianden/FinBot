It'll take a long time before that net benefit gets really good.\n\nI am very, very bearish on FSD. It's pretty clear at this point we're no longer looking at L6 and it's more becoming an L4 solution for California. It's very clear they are close to humans for daytime California with good weather, but that's a far cry from winter in Winnipeg during a snowstorm, and reliable enough you can take the driver away.\n\nIt's also pretty clear that a modest amount of progress takes 5+ years, as you get a lot of progress with a step change in how the development is done, then you get years of regressions and they have to re-evaluate and rebuild the model. This will ultimately require expensive upgrades to the hardware and customers that paid for FSD Bets in 2016-2018 vehicles will never receive an approved L4 solution, which will be a class action lawsuit.\n\nMeanwhile competitors like Waymo et al. are slow to build out but they have much lower rates of incidence than Tesla and will have over a decade of true driverless experience before Tesla will in the best case scenario, and will be competing in most major centres by the time FSD is actually regulatory approved (I'd guess \\~2033 at the current pace)\n\nIf Tesla can get their intervention rate down to 1,000 miles or less I will change my mind and would expect it to be ready in a year or so of data collection but best as I can tell they're not even at 100 yet, which is like... 500x easier than 1,000 and 50,000x easier than 10,000 where Waymo is at and that's just *barely* good enough for true robotaxis.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5928409099578857}], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["tsla"]}
