{"title": "Investing and Trading has Evolved. Tell Historians to Suck It", "selftext": "Let's keep this brief potato heads. Go watch some NHL video from 1980. Now watch some NHL video from today. Those idiots in 1980 would absolutely suck today. They'd be too slow and too dumb to play anywhere near the top league today. Same with other sports. \n\nThat's human nature. Through time we improve incrementally. We use the knowledge of prior generations as a base and add to it. So it's no surprise that an NBA player from 1980 would look like Krusty the Clown on a modern NBA team.\n\nWell guess what, same shit has happened in investing & trading. And on an even bigger scale. The stakes are much higher. Instead of your high school star athlete making the big leagues, we're talking about the most powerful companies in the world making superyacht money. The amount of resources devoted to \"solving\" markets is astronomical.\n\nSo now we have a different landscape from your dad's stupid tech company in 1998. Yeah, they were cute firing up their shitty computers and randomly pressing some buttons in a suit & tie. Investors were onto something back in the 90's tech bubble though. They realized the trick to investing...\n\nFRONT RUN EVERYTHING\n\nYeah bitch. Front run fucking everything. Radio on the internet? Fuck it, here's a billion dollars. Pets.com? Sure, you get $500M. Yeah, they took it a little too far in the 90's. But guess what, they were right. The internet was the future and the right early bets on internet companies made you wildly rich.\n\nThe reality was that, you could be wrong on 20 picks so long as you had the 1 Amazon / Microsoft / Apple. Plus, since people weren't front running as much back then, you didn't need to drop 100X Price-Sales on most of these picks (pre-1999). So who the fuck cares if you bought [Pets.com](http://Pets.com), [Broadcast.com](http://Broadcast.com), your dad's shitty tech startup? So long as you just accidentally bought one of the fucking juggernauts, all mistakes were easily forgiven.\n\nSo yeah, today we are thinking \"DAMN, Everything is so Expensive!\" \"AI is a Bubble!\" But guess what, that's just Boomer talk. From now on, everything that has a remote chance at being successful is gonna be front run to shit. You can forget about getting in at the bottom floor. Once an industry even hints that it will make a splash, some bastards are going to buy the shit out of it. The days where your dumb ass is gonna find Tesla at $10 or NVDA at $50 are long gone buddy.\n\nSo thanks for coming to my Ted Talk. Stop crying about valuations. The market is just smarter than it used to be. No one's saying THE PRICE IS RIGHT. They just don't give a fuck. Because a single 100X excuses 99 dingleberries.", "id": "1g0bxlk", "created_utc": 1728538888.0, "score": 195, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 81, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 10 | **First Seen In WSB** | 4 years ago\n**Total Comments** | 1272 | **Previous Best DD** | [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fkqsfl/shopify_short_this_biatch/) \n**Account Age** | 5 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Good story bro, lets see if you got it figured out.
