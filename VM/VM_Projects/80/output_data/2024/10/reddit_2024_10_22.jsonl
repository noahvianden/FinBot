Hold. Repeat. \nNot advice.  But here\u2019s why.\n\nI believe Nvidia is poised to hit a $10 trillion market cap within the next decade, if not sooner. This may seem like an outrageous number, but let\u2019s think it through logically. \n\nCan an American company grow to this size without exceeding 10-15% of our GDP? Absolutely. We should expect our national GDP to grow significantly, driven by the productivity enhancements, entertainment, and services brought by emerging AIs, in every conceivable form and even those we can\u2019t yet imagine. The pace of innovation is accelerating rapidly, with much more on the horizon.\n\nIf you look closely, read prolifically and open your mind to the future, I think you\u2019ll see it too. Keep reading if you want to learn more.\n\nNvidia has already expanded from a $1 trillion valuation to what is soon to be the largest company in the world by market cap (not including Saudi Aramco) in very little time. Currently valued at approximately $3.53 trillion, it is just a breath away from Apple\u2019s $3.56 trillion market cap and is on track to reach $4 trillion very soon\u2014possibly even this year.\n\nWhile this may seem like it couldn\u2019t possibly continue because it\u2019s already grown so far so fast, that\u2019s not logical. That\u2019s simply an emotional fear.  Let\u2019s just continue to look at it logically.  \n\nExamples of Rapid Innovation\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently stated that Nvidia will have one million digital employees (AIs) supporting its growing workforce, which is expected to increase from 30,000 to 50,000 human employees. Remarkably, many of these AIs (around 1,000) are already built on Nvidia\u2019s private data and are working alongside its current 34,000 human employees. This speed of innovation is astounding already and ramping quickly. These advanced AIs will consult with each other and human experts on Slack, create novel solutions together, and further accelerate productivity and R&D, all while providing significant cost savings to Nvidia as they operate 24/7 without traditional pay, requiring only energy.  \n\nThe advancements in AI are transformative and coming fast.  Tools like ChatGPT assist with planning trips, summarizing documents, debugging code, and more. The Proximity app tutors users on various subjects at any level, enhancing learning efficiency. (Jensen uses it daily).  Adobe has launched a feature that allows users to create movies from text prompts, while DALL-E generates stunning images from written descriptions. Microsoft Office\u2019s Co-Pilot creates PowerPoint slides and spreadsheets, while ChatGPT excels at interpreting data and summarizing market research faster than most individuals. From Siri managing appointments to cars assisting with lane changes and navigation, the integration of technology into our daily lives is seamless and profound.\n\nThe Road Ahead for Nvidia\n\nNvidia\u2019s potential extends far beyond its data center opportunities, which could generate nearly $1 trillion in sales over the next 4.5 years alone. The demand for computing power is growing exponentially. As Nvidia continues to lower its pricing per token and increase energy efficiency, companies will need to replace their data center installations at an accelerated pace to meet growing compute demands, save on energy costs, and enhance their service offerings. As Jensen said, \u201ceveryone wants to be first and everyone wants to be most.\u201d It\u2019s turf protection.\n\nIn terms of competition, companies like AMD and Intel are facing significant challenges. AMD is recently rumored to be pulling back on some TSMC commitments, and Nvidia will seize opportunities to meet its own supply needs. Intel, on the other hand, appears to be struggling and may not survive unless it separates its foundry operations from other segments. Similarly, Samsung is encountering its own difficulties in fabrication and R&D.\n\nEmerging Markets for Nvidia\n\nWhat other major markets could drive Nvidia to a $10 trillion market cap? Consider the following:\n\nNvidia\u2019s \u201cAI factories\u201d will sell their nims ai software agents to help anyone who wants to build Ai tools and agents for themselves.  Companies will be able to build \u201cdigital employees\u201d trained on their own data and offer digital service agents to their customers (this has simply massive potential for Nvidia and GDP productivity growth overall)\n\nAutomotive AIs for entertainment, driving assist and fully self-driving cars, not to\nMention robots for building the cars will be   huge for Nvidia platforms. \n\nRobotics in nearly every industry, place of business, home, yard and farm (massive potential)\n\nNew drug discovery, new smart medical devices, AI nurse agents and other medical services to enhance care (massive)\n\nNvidia is also generating approximately 50% earnings on its sales, leading to substantial cash reserves that will approach $100 billion next year. This capital will most likely be invested in stock buybacks and more startups, further accelerating the emergence of entirely new industries we can\u2019t yet envision while enhancing existing ones.\n\nThe Future and Conclusion\n\nNvidia\u2019s influence will extend to healthcare, robotics, government security, digital twins for industrial applications, and much more. The company is likely to increase its buyback program beyond the current $50 billion to manage dilution from employee grants, while also considering dividends\u2014though it would be wise to prioritize investments that maximize growth.\n\nJensen Huang will undoubtedly go down in history as a revolutionary figure. We are already using AI in many aspects of our lives, often without realizing it.\n\nI\u2019m excited about the future, though I remain cautious about privacy concerns and potential risks.\n\nIn conclusion, we are witnessing an industrial revolution that presents a generational opportunity to build wealth for ourselves and our families.\n\nTL;DR: Nvidia is set for immense growth. Far beyond where we are now. \n\nI\u2019m buying, holding, and repeating.\nThis is not financial advice.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": ["gdp", "aapl", "amd", "msft", "intc", "nvda"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["nvda"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Honestly I think we are in a transitional era.

Technical Analysis\nIntel Corporation (INTC) is currently trading around $22.56, with strong support at $22 and facing resistance at $24. The stock is consolidating between these levels, and if it breaks above $24, it has the potential to rally toward $28-$30 in the next 30 days. The technical analysis, including the RSI, shows that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, which indicates room for upward movement. This technical setup makes a call option viable if the stock breaks the $24 resistance.\n2. Price Movement Projection\nThe stock has been consolidating in a range between $22 and $24. If a breakout occurs above $24, there is potential for the stock to move upwards, possibly reaching resistance levels around $28 to $30. This price action provides a favorable risk/reward ratio for a call option with a 30-day horizon.\n3. Market Sentiment\nThe CHIPS Act and U.S. government policies supporting domestic semiconductor manufacturing provide strong tailwinds for Intel. Government backing for semiconductor production is likely to bolster Intel\u2019s stock, as the company benefits from subsidies and incentives. Investor sentiment is also showing signs of turning positive, especially with Intel\u2019s product pipeline and its role in the strategic push for semiconductor independence.\n4. Volatility and Risk Assessment\nImplied volatility (IV) is moderate, meaning that options are not heavily priced for a significant move yet. Historical volatility shows that Intel has been stabilizing, reducing risk while maintaining potential for upside. This makes it an attractive candidate for a call option. The risk is mitigated by strong support levels at $22, and the opportunity is maximized if Intel breaks through $24.\n5. Call Option Success Likelihood\nBased on the technical indicators, market sentiment, and volatility profile, the likelihood of a successful call option on Intel (INTC) over the next 30 days is estimated to be between 65% and 70%. This assumes that the stock breaks through the $24 resistance level. If it fails to break this level, the likelihood would decrease.\n6. Entry and Exit Suggestions\nEntry Point: A good entry point for a call option would be when Intel breaks above the $24 resistance level. This would confirm bullish momentum and increase the likelihood of a breakout toward the $28-$30 range.\nExit Point: A suitable exit point would be at the $28-$30 resistance level, or if there is a failure to hold the $22 support level. Alternatively, you could set a stop-loss just below the $22 support level to minimize downside risk in case of a bearish reversal.\n7. Updated Likelihood Post-Breakout\nIf Intel (INTC) breaks above the $24 resistance level, the likelihood of a successful call option increases. This is due to the expected momentum shift, fewer immediate resistance levels, and potential volume confirmation. After breaking $24, the estimated probability of a successful call option is between 75% and 80%. The chances increase further if the breakout is accompanied by high trading volume or positive news.
