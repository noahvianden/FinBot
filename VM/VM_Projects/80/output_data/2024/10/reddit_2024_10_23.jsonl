Entirely doable.\n\nHere\u2019s why. (Copied from a post I made on another thread today)\n\nI believe Nvidia is poised to hit a $10 trillion market cap within the next decade. This may seem like an outrageous number, but let\u2019s think it through logically.\n\nCan an American company grow to this size without exceeding 10-15% of our GDP? Absolutely. We should expect our national GDP to grow significantly, driven by the productivity enhancements, entertainment, and services brought by emerging AIs, in every conceivable form and even those we can\u2019t yet imagine. The pace of innovation is accelerating rapidly, with much more on the horizon.\n\nIf you look closely, read prolifically and open your mind to the future, I think you\u2019ll see it too. Keep reading if you want to learn more.\n\nNvidia has already expanded from a $1 trillion valuation to what is soon to be the largest company in the world by market cap (not including Saudi Aramco) in very little time. Currently valued at approximately $3.53 trillion, it is just a breath away from Apple\u2019s $3.56 trillion market cap and is on track to reach $4 trillion very soon\u2014possibly even this year.\n\nWhile this may seem like it couldn\u2019t possibly continue because it\u2019s already grown so far so fast, that\u2019s not logical. That\u2019s simply an emotional fear.  Let\u2019s just continue to look at it logically.\n\nExamples of Rapid Innovation\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently stated that Nvidia will have one million digital employees (AIs) supporting its growing workforce, which is expected to increase from 30,000 to 50,000 human employees. Remarkably, many of these AIs (around 1,000) are already built on Nvidia\u2019s private data and are working alongside its current 34,000 human employees. This speed of innovation is astounding and ramping quickly. These advanced AIs will consult with each other and human experts on Slack, create novel solutions together, and further accelerate productivity and R&D, all while providing significant cost savings to Nvidia as they operate 24/7 without traditional pay, requiring only energy and getting smarter continuously.\n\nThe advancements in AI are transformative and coming fast.  Tools like ChatGPT assist with planning trips, summarizing and editing documents, debugging code, and more. The Proximity app tutors users on various subjects at any level, enhancing learning efficiency. (Jensen uses it daily).  Adobe has launched a feature that allows users to create movies from text prompts, while DALL-E generates stunning images from written descriptions. Microsoft Office\u2019s Co-Pilot creates PowerPoint slides and spreadsheets, while ChatGPT excels at interpreting data and summarizing market research faster than most individuals. From Siri managing appointments to cars assisting with lane changes and navigation, the integration of technology into our daily lives is seamless and profound.\n\nThe Road Ahead for Nvidia\n\nNvidia\u2019s potential extends far beyond its data center opportunities, which look to generate nearly $1 trillion in sales over the next 4.5 years alone. The demand for computing power is growing exponentially. As Nvidia continues to lower its pricing per token and increase energy efficiency, I believe companies will need to replace their data center installations at an accelerated pace to meet growing compute demands, save on energy costs, and enhance their service offerings. It\u2019s table stakes for turf protection. As Jensen said, \u201ceveryone wants to be first and everyone wants to be most.\u201d\n\nIn terms of competition, companies like AMD and Intel are facing significant challenges. AMD is recently rumored to be pulling back on some TSMC commitments, and Nvidia will seize opportunities to meet its own supply needs. Intel, on the other hand, appears to be struggling and may not survive unless it separates its foundry operations from other segments. Similarly, Samsung is encountering its own difficulties in fabrication and R&D. The ASICs in development will have their niche markets, but they are so workload specific and brittle, they fail to offer the flexibility of GPUs in a rapidly moving and  changing environment, where flexibility and speed is king.\n\nEmerging Markets for Nvidia\n\nWhat other major markets could drive Nvidia to a $10 trillion market cap? Consider the following:\n\nNvidia\u2019s \u201cAI factories\u201d will sell their Nim ai software agents to help anyone who wants to build Ai tools and agents.  Companies will build \u201cdigital employees\u201d trained on their own data and offer digital service agents to their customers. This has simply massive potential for Nvidia earnings as well as strong growth in productivity and GDP nationwide.\n\nAutomotive AIs are being used for entertainment, driving assist and fully self-driving cars, using Nvidia platforms,  not to mention their ais are helping to design and build the cars. This fast growing market will be very large and Nvidia is gaining rapid traction. \n\nRobotics for nearly every industry, place of business, home, yard, farm and nation are coming and many are already here. It\u2019s a massive market.  Nvidia AIs will train them and be used for fast inferencing, the even larger market.\n\nNew drug discovery, new smart medical devices, AI nurse agents and other medical services to enhance patient care are in development and moving fast. This industry is simply massive. Nvidia is helping open these industries through their start up investments, tech platforms, software and services. \n\nNvidia is also generating approximately 50% earnings on its sales, leading to substantial cash reserves that will approach $100 billion next year. This capital will most likely be invested in stock buybacks and more startups, further accelerating the emergence of entirely new industries we can\u2019t yet envision while enhancing existing ones.\n\nThe Future and Conclusion\n\nNvidia\u2019s influence will extend to healthcare, robotics, government security, digital twins for industrial applications, and much more. The company is likely to increase its buyback program beyond the current $50 billion to manage dilution from employee grants, while also considering dividends\u2014though it would be wise to prioritize investments that maximize growth. And I expect they will. \n\nJensen Huang will undoubtedly go down in history as a tech revolutionary and a genius leader of innovation and productivity. \n\nWe are already using AI in many aspects of our lives, often without realizing it. \n\nI\u2019m excited about the future, though I remain cautious about privacy concerns and potential risks.\n\nIn conclusion, we are witnessing an industrial revolution that presents a generational opportunity to build wealth for ourselves and our families.\n\nTL;DR: Nvidia is set for immense growth.

Entirely doable.\n\nHere\u2019s why. (Copied from a post I made on another thread today)\n\nI believe Nvidia is poised to hit a $10 trillion market cap within the next decade. This may seem like an outrageous number, but let\u2019s think it through logically.\n\nCan an American company grow to this size without exceeding 10-15% of our GDP? Absolutely. We should expect our national GDP to grow significantly, driven by the productivity enhancements, entertainment, and services brought by emerging AIs, in every conceivable form and even those we can\u2019t yet imagine. The pace of innovation is accelerating rapidly, with much more on the horizon.\n\nIf you look closely, read prolifically and open your mind to the future, I think you\u2019ll see it too. Keep reading if you want to learn more.\n\nNvidia has already expanded from a $1 trillion valuation to what is soon to be the largest company in the world by market cap (not including Saudi Aramco) in very little time. Currently valued at approximately $3.53 trillion, it is just a breath away from Apple\u2019s $3.56 trillion market cap and is on track to reach $4 trillion very soon\u2014possibly even this year.\n\nWhile this may seem like it couldn\u2019t possibly continue because it\u2019s already grown so far so fast, that\u2019s not logical. That\u2019s simply an emotional fear.  Let\u2019s just continue to look at it logically.\n\nExamples of Rapid Innovation\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently stated that Nvidia will have one million digital employees (AIs) supporting its growing workforce, which is expected to increase from 30,000 to 50,000 human employees. Remarkably, many of these AIs (around 1,000) are already built on Nvidia\u2019s private data and are working alongside its current 34,000 human employees. This speed of innovation is astounding and ramping quickly. These advanced AIs will consult with each other and human experts on Slack, create novel solutions together, and further accelerate productivity and R&D, all while providing significant cost savings to Nvidia as they operate 24/7 without traditional pay, requiring only energy and getting smarter continuously.\n\nThe advancements in AI are transformative and coming fast.  Tools like ChatGPT assist with planning trips, summarizing and editing documents, debugging code, and more. The Proximity app tutors users on various subjects at any level, enhancing learning efficiency. (Jensen uses it daily).  Adobe has launched a feature that allows users to create movies from text prompts, while DALL-E generates stunning images from written descriptions. Microsoft Office\u2019s Co-Pilot creates PowerPoint slides and spreadsheets, while ChatGPT excels at interpreting data and summarizing market research faster than most individuals. From Siri managing appointments to cars assisting with lane changes and navigation, the integration of technology into our daily lives is seamless and profound.\n\nThe Road Ahead for Nvidia\n\nNvidia\u2019s potential extends far beyond its data center opportunities, which look to generate nearly $1 trillion in sales over the next 4.5 years alone. The demand for computing power is growing exponentially. As Nvidia continues to lower its pricing per token and increase energy efficiency, I believe companies will need to replace their data center installations at an accelerated pace to meet growing compute demands, save on energy costs, and enhance their service offerings. It\u2019s table stakes for turf protection. As Jensen said, \u201ceveryone wants to be first and everyone wants to be most.\u201d\n\nIn terms of competition, companies like AMD and Intel are facing significant challenges. AMD is recently rumored to be pulling back on some TSMC commitments, and Nvidia will seize opportunities to meet its own supply needs. Intel, on the other hand, appears to be struggling and may not survive unless it separates its foundry operations from other segments. Similarly, Samsung is encountering its own difficulties in fabrication and R&D. The ASICs in development will have their niche markets, but they are so workload specific and brittle, they fail to offer the flexibility of GPUs in a rapidly moving and  changing environment, where flexibility and speed is king.\n\nEmerging Markets for Nvidia\n\nWhat other major markets could drive Nvidia to a $10 trillion market cap? Consider the following:\n\nNvidia\u2019s \u201cAI factories\u201d will sell their Nim ai software agents to help anyone who wants to build Ai tools and agents.  Companies will build \u201cdigital employees\u201d trained on their own data and offer digital service agents to their customers. This has simply massive potential for Nvidia earnings as well as strong growth in productivity and GDP nationwide.\n\nAutomotive AIs are being used for entertainment, driving assist and fully self-driving cars, using Nvidia platforms,  not to mention their ais are helping to design and build the cars. This fast growing market will be very large and Nvidia is gaining rapid traction. \n\nRobotics for nearly every industry, place of business, home, yard, farm and nation are coming and many are already here. It\u2019s a massive market.  Nvidia AIs will train them and be used for fast inferencing, the even larger market.\n\nNew drug discovery, new smart medical devices, AI nurse agents and other medical services to enhance patient care are in development and moving fast. This industry is simply massive. Nvidia is helping open these industries through their start up investments, tech platforms, software and services. \n\nNvidia is also generating approximately 50% earnings on its sales, leading to substantial cash reserves that will approach $100 billion next year. This capital will most likely be invested in stock buybacks and more startups, further accelerating the emergence of entirely new industries we can\u2019t yet envision while enhancing existing ones.\n\nThe Future and Conclusion\n\nNvidia\u2019s influence will extend to healthcare, robotics, government security, digital twins for industrial applications, and much more. The company is likely to increase its buyback program beyond the current $50 billion to manage dilution from employee grants, while also considering dividends\u2014though it would be wise to prioritize investments that maximize growth. And I expect they will. \n\nJensen Huang will undoubtedly go down in history as a tech revolutionary and a genius leader of innovation and productivity. \n\nWe are already using AI in many aspects of our lives, often without realizing it. \n\nI\u2019m excited about the future, though I remain cautious about privacy concerns and potential risks.\n\nIn conclusion, we are witnessing an industrial revolution that presents a generational opportunity to build wealth for ourselves and our families.\n\nTL;DR: Nvidia is set for immense growth.
