They are free to trade on information they come across because it is material but not nonpublic. Let's illustrate this with a few examples.\n\n>If an analyst for an investment bank calls an executive at a company and asks specific questions about the company's upcoming earnings, and the executive answers 1) honestly, 2) without suggesting a quid pro quo and 3) without requiring a promise of confidentiality and non-use from the analyst; then the analyst is free to use that data for personal gain, because legally the executive has effectively made this information public. There is a legal grey area of an executive giving information without that requirement, then calling the analyst up and trying to enforce confidentiality after the fact, but that's really an edge case and isn't relevant here.\n\n>If I am employed at a semiconductor company and in the course of my professional work I discover that a publicly traded company lost a huge contract, and I lead the way to securing that contract for my company, then 1) it is illegal for me to trade my own company's stock in response (I am an insider and have a confidentiality relationship), but 2) it is perfectly legal for me to short that other company, because I have no confidentiality relationship with them (assuming my employer doesn't restrict this, which they might - read your NDAs carefully.)\n\n>If your work involves heading out to solar panel fields to repair them, and you've been all over the country and draw certain well-founded conclusions about the health of a company that manufactures these things, yes, you are allowed to trade on that data legally (again, in the absence of another employment agreement requiring that you do not, which establishes confidentiality). If your company is set to profit from this, no, you can't trade your own company's stock - that generally constitutes illegal inside trading.\n\n>If I am sitting in a Starbucks and I overhear two executives who happen to be talking about their companies merging, and this information has not yet been released to the public, I am allowed to trade on this information. The information was obtained in a public setting without a covenant of confidentiality established prior to my discovery. Conversely, if I see them in the Starbucks and bribe them for information, I am not allowed to trade on the information, because I established a quid pro quo with people who do have a confidentiality relationship.\n\n>Insider trading is extremely nuanced and extremely widely misunderstood. It is so misunderstood and so nuanced, that Matt Levine (a columnist at Bloomberg who writes \"Money Stuff\") has a habit of writing about all the weird developments in insider trading case law and odd edge cases that come up, because they're complex enough to make a frequent appearance in a finance column. The media (as an aggregate group reporting on this subject) has fixated on the idea that Congress is exempt from insider trading, but that is not factual. It doesn't help that there is a strong ideological sentiment against the finance industry which, regardless of whether or not it's well-founded (I'm not going to comment on that), somewhat muddies the water when laypeople are looking for legitimate misconduct; this is especially prevalent when combined with the fact that most people simply don't understand what Wall Street does aside from the odd picture of a bunch of guys yelling in the middle of an exchange floor here and there (it does quite a lot!). As an academic concept in the legal and financial spheres, insider trading and mundane research could be thought of as a Venn diagram with some, but not total (nor even majority) overlap. The public conception of insider trading is that anything you find out in a professional context that, say, your friends and family don't know is illegal to use.

They are free to trade on information they come across because it is material but not nonpublic. Let's illustrate this with a few examples.\n\n>If an analyst for an investment bank calls an executive at a company and asks specific questions about the company's upcoming earnings, and the executive answers 1) honestly, 2) without suggesting a quid pro quo and 3) without requiring a promise of confidentiality and non-use from the analyst; then the analyst is free to use that data for personal gain, because legally the executive has effectively made this information public. There is a legal grey area of an executive giving information without that requirement, then calling the analyst up and trying to enforce confidentiality after the fact, but that's really an edge case and isn't relevant here.\n\n>If I am employed at a semiconductor company and in the course of my professional work I discover that a publicly traded company lost a huge contract, and I lead the way to securing that contract for my company, then 1) it is illegal for me to trade my own company's stock in response (I am an insider and have a confidentiality relationship), but 2) it is perfectly legal for me to short that other company, because I have no confidentiality relationship with them (assuming my employer doesn't restrict this, which they might - read your NDAs carefully.)\n\n>If your work involves heading out to solar panel fields to repair them, and you've been all over the country and draw certain well-founded conclusions about the health of a company that manufactures these things, yes, you are allowed to trade on that data legally (again, in the absence of another employment agreement requiring that you do not, which establishes confidentiality). If your company is set to profit from this, no, you can't trade your own company's stock - that generally constitutes illegal inside trading.\n\n>If I am sitting in a Starbucks and I overhear two executives who happen to be talking about their companies merging, and this information has not yet been released to the public, I am allowed to trade on this information. The information was obtained in a public setting without a covenant of confidentiality established prior to my discovery. Conversely, if I see them in the Starbucks and bribe them for information, I am not allowed to trade on the information, because I established a quid pro quo with people who do have a confidentiality relationship.\n\n>Insider trading is extremely nuanced and extremely widely misunderstood. It is so misunderstood and so nuanced, that Matt Levine (a columnist at Bloomberg who writes \"Money Stuff\") has a habit of writing about all the weird developments in insider trading case law and odd edge cases that come up, because they're complex enough to make a frequent appearance in a finance column. The media (as an aggregate group reporting on this subject) has fixated on the idea that Congress is exempt from insider trading, but that is not factual. It doesn't help that there is a strong ideological sentiment against the finance industry which, regardless of whether or not it's well-founded (I'm not going to comment on that), somewhat muddies the water when laypeople are looking for legitimate misconduct; this is especially prevalent when combined with the fact that most people simply don't understand what Wall Street does aside from the odd picture of a bunch of guys yelling in the middle of an exchange floor here and there (it does quite a lot!). As an academic concept in the legal and financial spheres, insider trading and mundane research could be thought of as a Venn diagram with some, but not total (nor even majority) overlap. The public conception of insider trading is that anything you find out in a professional context that, say, your friends and family don't know is illegal to use.

Usually the code for those operations is written using high level framework (like tensorflow or PyTorch) and behind the scenes the operations are broken down and use the appropriate backend's simple instructions, so that you can write code that is hardware agnostic (for example, you can write `c = a * b` and the result will be the same no matter what GPU or CPU you use; you don't care about the underlying hardware's architecture and how it would compute the result).\n\nThe issue is Nvidia (currently) has the best hardware so even if AMD optimized its drivers/software platform as much as it could, Nvidia would still have the edge due to more efficient hardware (it's like optimizing CPU usage as much as you can versus using the GPU \u2014 the GPU is way better at parallelization and it could be 100x faster than the CPU, while the CPU optimization would give you, say, a 5% edge, compared to the non-optimized CPU usage).", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["amd", "nvda"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["amd", "nvda"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3259428143501282}], "tickers": ["amd", "nvda"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Here\u2019s AMD\u2019s stock future: If Nvidia continues upward, AMD will too.
