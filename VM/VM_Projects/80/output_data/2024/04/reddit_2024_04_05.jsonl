Government debt is a huge one. The United States government cannot really function with rates this high. It just constantly piles on that debt to GDP. The government also finances itself through taxes but also through selling bonds. They have to pay a higher interest rate on those bonds so it's in the interest of the United States government to lower rates regardless. The argument is also that we know the rates that we're at are restrictive so it's really a matter of time before it starts showing up in the data. Predicting when that will happen has been impossible. Seems like it should have happened by now but it hasn't but it will eventually. I think there's a lot of political pressure for ray cuts and really they are preemptive. Being reactionary is just a terrible terrible policy. Some of the worst laws, worst policies worst social customs they are all from reactionary thinking rather than preemptive. There's another problem. If the Fed does decide to go ignorant and be reactionary the problem that sets up is by the time it becomes very obvious in the data, the slowdown is apparent, the jobs aren't being created the inflation is rapidly coming down. It's too late. They will overshoot the target then you go into a slow or negative GDP environment. The potential for an undershoot of inflation happens. If you look at 2008 one of the worst things is what happened to the unemployment rate. That's one of the primary reasons we had such a massive correction. You had the housing thing and then you had that high unemployment rate. They don't need to rapidly slash rates either. What they have to do is set the stage to convince people inflation is okay and very slowly lower rates over the next 36 to 48 months. \n\nThis is the longest pause I think on record or at least modern record The Fed has held neutral.

Government debt is a huge one. The United States government cannot really function with rates this high. It just constantly piles on that debt to GDP. The government also finances itself through taxes but also through selling bonds. They have to pay a higher interest rate on those bonds so it's in the interest of the United States government to lower rates regardless. The argument is also that we know the rates that we're at are restrictive so it's really a matter of time before it starts showing up in the data. Predicting when that will happen has been impossible. Seems like it should have happened by now but it hasn't but it will eventually. I think there's a lot of political pressure for ray cuts and really they are preemptive. Being reactionary is just a terrible terrible policy. Some of the worst laws, worst policies worst social customs they are all from reactionary thinking rather than preemptive. There's another problem. If the Fed does decide to go ignorant and be reactionary the problem that sets up is by the time it becomes very obvious in the data, the slowdown is apparent, the jobs aren't being created the inflation is rapidly coming down. It's too late. They will overshoot the target then you go into a slow or negative GDP environment. The potential for an undershoot of inflation happens. If you look at 2008 one of the worst things is what happened to the unemployment rate. That's one of the primary reasons we had such a massive correction. You had the housing thing and then you had that high unemployment rate. They don't need to rapidly slash rates either.
