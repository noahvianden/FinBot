Buy and hold beats theta in a bull market, selling your shares beats theta in a bear market. Both because theta decay does not overcome the delta (underlying share price change) and gamma (rate of change of the share price change) when there are sudden moves, even with high vega (volatility of the change of premium). Theta only outperforms in flat markets.\n\nAs markets and stock prices are always dynamically changing, rather than statically stable, is not common that markets stay flat for long periods of time. To do theta in the long run is a losing strategy.\n\nThe better way to think of theta trades is that you are utilizing trades for entering (selling covered puts) or exiting (selling covered calls) positions in a lukewarm manner that spreads out risk. For example, if you\u2019ve got the cash and want to gradually enter/exit a position 100 shares at a time because your conviction is low, theta is a great way to do so and lower the risk of such an event happening, then combine with buying/selling the shares when your conviction is high. The caveat is that you also lower the probability that you will enter/exit that position and buy/sell those shares.\n\nIf you sell covered calls or covered puts and the underlying rallies, then you kick yourself for missing the boat after it left the docks. If you sell covered calls or covered puts and the underlying tanks, then you kick yourself for not getting off the boat before it sank.\n\nTo illustrate my belief that theta trades are best used in a combined strategy of entering or exiting a position, here are two scenarios:\n* Bull thesis: You own 0 shares of the underlying. Buy 100 shares. Sell a covered put to potentially acquire more shares. Buy another 100 shares if the underlying begins to rally, getting a discount from the covered put premium. You end up with 200 or 300 shares at expiry.\n* Bear thesis: You already own 300 shares of the underlying. Sell 100 shares. Sell a covered call to potentially sell more shares. Sell another 100 shares if the underlying begins to tank, keeping some of your gains with the premium from the covered call. You end up with 0 or 100 shares at expiry.", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": ">an incorrect baseline assumption that theta trades are for outperforming the market.\n\nWell said.

Buy and hold beats theta in a bull market, selling your shares beats theta in a bear market. Both because theta decay does not overcome the delta (underlying share price change) and gamma (rate of change of the share price change) when there are sudden moves, even with high vega (volatility of the change of premium). Theta only outperforms in flat markets.\n\nAs markets and stock prices are always dynamically changing, rather than statically stable, is not common that markets stay flat for long periods of time. To do theta in the long run is a losing strategy.\n\nThe better way to think of theta trades is that you are utilizing trades for entering (selling covered puts) or exiting (selling covered calls) positions in a lukewarm manner that spreads out risk. For example, if you\u2019ve got the cash and want to gradually enter/exit a position 100 shares at a time because your conviction is low, theta is a great way to do so and lower the risk of such an event happening, then combine with buying/selling the shares when your conviction is high. The caveat is that you also lower the probability that you will enter/exit that position and buy/sell those shares.\n\nIf you sell covered calls or covered puts and the underlying rallies, then you kick yourself for missing the boat after it left the docks. If you sell covered calls or covered puts and the underlying tanks, then you kick yourself for not getting off the boat before it sank.\n\nTo illustrate my belief that theta trades are best used in a combined strategy of entering or exiting a position, here are two scenarios:\n* Bull thesis: You own 0 shares of the underlying. Buy 100 shares. Sell a covered put to potentially acquire more shares. Buy another 100 shares if the underlying begins to rally, getting a discount from the covered put premium. You end up with 200 or 300 shares at expiry.\n* Bear thesis: You already own 300 shares of the underlying. Sell 100 shares. Sell a covered call to potentially sell more shares. Sell another 100 shares if the underlying begins to tank, keeping some of your gains with the premium from the covered call.
