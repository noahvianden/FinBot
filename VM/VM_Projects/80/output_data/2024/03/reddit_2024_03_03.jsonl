Let me try to say how to make it happen. \n\nI see QQQ expiry in 320 days and 470 days. I pick 470 days since it is longer than 1 year. Feel free to change to suit your timeframe.\n\nCurrent price is 445, there is no strike at 445, so I pick 450. 450 strike is priced at 33, whereas 440 strike is priced at 29.

Our theta gangers like to write puts at delta 30, that's too rich for my taste in this specific case since we want to make money on the crash. So instead of writing put at 435 (30 delta) and get 5.5 bucks back, let's write a put at 420, April expiry, and make 2.5 bucks. Does not cut down our cost much but repeat it 2-3 times it would not hurt as much. I am not saying you will be able to repeat it every single month because hey what if price moves to 500? Or 600? Just creating the initial position to take some cost away. 435 is basically not betting on crash, 420 at least takes it beyond halfway to our expiry break even. \n\nThis is basically a poor man's covered put in structure but with deltas totally out of what but it starts with your premise of ATM put. \n\nRead up more on PmCC and PMcP and see if you can fine tune it further.\n\nOf course this trade does not give you the benefit of seeing QQQ crash to 150 bucks, 250 bucks or even 350 bucks but it is a starting move and if you can run multiple contracts some of them could be just pure long puts as long as you finance them right.", "score": 6, "replies": [], "tickers": ["vix", "crash"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "No one can tell what the market will do or when, so this is in effect a gamble.\n\nIMO using a diagonal that sells OTM puts which can help pay for the long put while waiting for whatever you think is going to happen, but this will also limit the possible profits.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "(I'm commenting here because I always appreciate your analysis on this subreddit).
