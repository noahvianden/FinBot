{"title": "Blackwell is not delayed - And it will surprise the hell out of the market next quarter - Here's what people don't understand - Here is the reality of Q3", "selftext": "NVIDIA's H100 GPUs were in such high demand they were backlogged with lead times up to 11 months. Now that has been improved to 2 - 3 month wait. And we are only talking about the H100's here.\n\n[https://www.tomshardware.com/news/nvidia-to-reportedly-triple-output-of-compute-gpus-in-2024-up-to-2-million-h100s](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/nvidia-to-reportedly-triple-output-of-compute-gpus-in-2024-up-to-2-million-h100s)\n\n>**Triple the output, triple the revenue?**  \nNvidia, which just\u00a0[earned over $10 billion in one quarter](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/nvidia-hits-record-dollar135-billion-revenue-on-explosive-ai-gpu-sales)\u00a0on its datacenter-oriented compute GPUs, plans to at least triple output of such products in 2024, according to\u00a0*the*\u00a0[*Financial Times*](https://www.ft.com/content/c7e9cfa9-3f68-47d3-92fc-7cf85bcb73b3), which cites sources with knowledge of the matter. The move is very ambitious and if Nvidia manages to pull it off and demand for its A100, H100 and other compute CPUs for artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance computing (HPC) applications remains strong, this could mean incredible revenue for the company.\n\n[https://www.trendforce.com/news/2024/07/02/news-nvidias-h200-order-delivered-from-q3-boosting-server-supply-chain-with-strong-demand/](https://www.trendforce.com/news/2024/07/02/news-nvidias-h200-order-delivered-from-q3-boosting-server-supply-chain-with-strong-demand/)\n\n[https://www.tweaktown.com/news/97478/nvidia-h100-ai-gpu-lead-times-improve-4-month-wait-is-now-2-3/index.html](https://www.tweaktown.com/news/97478/nvidia-h100-ai-gpu-lead-times-improve-4-month-wait-is-now-2-3/index.html)\n\nNvidia is looking to triple output in 2024 to meet the strong demand. This is the general rise of revenue each and every quarter. It's rate limiting folks. If you were looking to make hamburgers and have 200 hamburger buns and only 50 beef patties than limit on hamburgers you can make is 50. You can't make 200 burgers because there is not enough patties. So, when you go to the patty producers and say, \"can you make me more patties i.e. x3\" now you can make 150 burgers.\n\nFor the H200 GPUs, large-scale deliveries are starting in Q3, 2024. The H200 had a limited initial rollout compared to the H100, but demand is expected to grow as production scales up.\n\nBecause Jensen is a genius and nobody can figure out what he is saying so clearly everyone missed what was actually being said.\n\nWhat we know as absolute facts is that in Q2 production ready blackwell units were sent out. i.e. AKA the samples.\n\nThe only thing Jensen left off the Q2 call was that he left out anything for what was going on for Q3. Jensen perfectly matched what he said in Q1 minus mentioning anything in Q3. So to repeat what Jensen said in the Q1 call was this: Q2 production samples, Q3 ramp up, Q4 deliveries.\n\n**In Q2 this is what was said and what was actually done in terms of production Blackwells:**\n\nIn Q2 samples were sent. Check\n\nIn Q3 he doesn't say anything about it (I have a feel for why)\n\nIn Q4 there will be deliveries of Blackwell\n\nIn 2024 and I quote from Jensen Huang, \"There will be billions and billions of Blackwell revenue in 2024\".\n\nThat matches up with what he said in Q1. Can anyone here say for sure there won't be an initial ramp of blackwell in Q3? Can anyone here say exactly when payments come into the OEM/ORM's for compared to when they actually receive the order? I can't so unless someone here can explain the billing practices intimately I would say we don't really know. The payments could be prior to shipment or upon delivery. There could be a 25% - 75% split. Something to that effect. We don't know individual enterprise payment agreements and thus revenue collected.\n\nThe reason I believe he left out Q3 is because he still has to deliver so many H100's and H200's. He can't possibly just push out H200 commitments and ramp up B100's for christ sakes H200's were just released with [\"H200 AI-GPU entered mass production in late Q2\".](https://www.trendforce.com/news/2024/07/02/news-nvidias-h200-order-delivered-from-q3-boosting-server-supply-chain-with-strong-demand/)\n\nAs soon as there can be Blackwell ramp up there will be. I firmly believe limited production of GB200's will start in Q3. That I think will be the quarter surprise and where Jensen will surprise on the last call. No one on the call asked if anything would be specifically started in limited production in Q3.\n\nHe conservatively called the Q3 quarter.
