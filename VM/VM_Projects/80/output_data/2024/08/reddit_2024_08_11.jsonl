Yes, you are reading this right. The US, a 1st world country and 4rd in terms of landmass, cannot build two-way rail network.

In the US, utility companies for power, water, gas, & sewage tend to be allowed to operate as \u201cregulated monopolies\u201d", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.05908630043268204}, {"body": "Sometimes a city or county will provide those services, but most of the US is served by investor owned utilities (IOUs)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.03970976546406746}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.12527525424957275}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5700299143791199}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3118523359298706}, {"body": "Our country doesn't seem to know what a monopoly is anymore. Remember, a monopoly is when an organization controls access to manufacturing and distribution, and there are no close substitutes. With the complexities of supply chains, it's very difficult to see any modern companies themselves as monopolies since there is very little any of them control unilaterally.\n\nApple is \"engineered in Cupertino,\" but manufactured in China, in facilities they only own insofar as the CCP will allow. They have Apple stores where they are sold, but are also available at Best Buy, and other retailers. The same can be said for Microsoft, for example.\n\nPeople say Google has a monopoly, but their main product is a form of digital advertising, which competes with social media and other formats. Bing, DuckDuckGo, and other types of search engine also exist. Yet they are considered a monopoly for some reason. Facebook has also been considered a monopoly of sorts over the years.\n\nMany of these companies play the role of monopolistic enterprise for publicity's sake like Microsoft did. Another reason companies do this is because it enables them to engage with government so they can pass legislation that enables them to maintain market position.\n\nThe real monopolies around here are BlackRock & Vanguard. These are companies which are supposed to be competitors in that they offer the same service at the same scale, yet Vanguard is a major shareholder in BlackRock's stock, and BlackRock is a major customer of Vanguard's. They also together own the same companies and companies which are supposed to compete against one another which means they are not true competitors.\n\nTheir false sense of competition demonstrates a monopoly in money management. And it enables them to exert undue influence in major market decisions given they can swing things in whichever direction they choose.\n\nLook at their positions in individual companies compared to the ownership their ETF's have in those same individual companies, and the customer always has less ownership meaning BlackRock & Vanguard are flouting their fiduciary responsibility.\n\nOne of the hallmarks of a monopoly is the fact that there appears to be choice where no choice exists, beyond market dominance.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "This is stupid.

I don't think it means what you think it means.  A monopoly is a company with no competitors (or no real competitors) that dominates an industry to the point where they can crush all potential competition and basically set their own pricing.\n\n>S&P - Credit rating agency, oligopoly on credit ratings.
