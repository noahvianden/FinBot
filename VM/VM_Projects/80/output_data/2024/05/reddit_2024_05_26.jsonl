They let the market figure things out, just like they did with apps, and just like they did with the iPhone, and then buy the very best and let the others duke it out.\n\nWhat Apple is doing with AI is exactly what Apple has done with every other technology wave. They\u2019re not going to miss it.

Apple\u2019s strategy rarely worked outside of the hardware domain, in which they had/have some of the best talent in the world in terms of engineering,  design, manufacturing, supply chain, etc.\n\nBut when it comes to service software, Apple doesn\u2019t have such advantage. Apple Maps and Siri do not live up to the standard of their hardware. Apple TV is decent but it\u2019s got no tech advantage over any of the other streaming services.\n\nNow when it comes to AI, follow the talent. The best and brightest are going to a few top companies in the world right now but Apple isn\u2019t one of those destinations. It\u2019s a field that requires just as much compute as it requires human talent.\n\nFor example Apple succeeded in the SoC product line because it managed to get some of the best talent in the world through [acquisitions](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/28/technology/28apple.html#:~:text=Apple%20wants%20the%20fastest%20chip,often%20found%20in%20mobile%20devices. ) and aggressive hiring. But unless Apple buys Mistral (unlikely) or OpenAI (almost impossible), it won\u2019t have the talent war chest required to fight this campaign.\n\nBtw not only did I work for 15 years in the valley, a close family member of mine recently got a ML/AI PhD from a top university/advisor and the offers he\u2019s been getting almost makes *me* jealous lol.", "score": 55, "replies": [{"body": "I helped launched the iPhone and am a former Apple senior engineer myself.

Apple was able to buy Intrinsity for a fraction of the value of what AI startups are worth today.\n\nDoes Apple have a huge cash reserve? Yes it does, but making huge acquisitions has never been its modus operandi. What\u2019s the largest acquisition Apple has ever done? It's barely $3B when they bought Beats. \n\nBy comparison Anthropic is valued at $20B, and OpenAI is valued at $100B. Apple has never made purchases close to that size.\n\nWhich is why I don\u2019t think Apple\u2019s traditional playbook applies in the software world today.\n\nThen there is the culture differences of building software vs. building hardware. Apple Maps and Siri are prime examples of Apple's software game being significantly behind their hardware game. \n\nBut again, it would be great if you can share some insights too.
