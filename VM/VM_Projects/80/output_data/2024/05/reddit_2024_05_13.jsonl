If it's greater than 1.5%, then straddle and if less than 1.5% then don't straddle. When my model indicates that we should straddle, it is correct about 80% of the time that the price will swing 1.5% or more over the next 5 days relative to the next day's open. So we make the prediction at the end of D that at some point during D+1 , D+2, D+3, D+4 and D+5 that the price will swing at least 1.5% in any direction from D+1's open (as that's the day we'll be buying the option). \n\nTo further clarify it's not 1.5% from close-to-close, it's 1.5% *at any point* (e.g. if the open is 100, and the low that day is 97, that's a 3% swing). I hope that all makes sense.\n\nI've also included a link to my year-by-year backdown of accuracy. Naive accuracy refers to just guessing every single time that the price will swing 1.5% from D1's opening. You'll see the average accuracy by year and the weighted accuracy on the bottom right to account for the # of trades.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/wlycbXx](https://imgur.com/a/wlycbXx)\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or anything seems fishy.

No, I don't buy it.\n\nNaturally, a model trained on 20 years of historical data is going to perform very well in a backtest using the same 20 years of historical data! It's how well the model does going forward that matters. I don't think that 80% accuracy is going to hold up if you spend the next year or two collecting predictions and comparing to actuals as they happen.\n\nBut to address the initial question, yes, of course a model that accurately predicts the magnitude of percentage moves, while saying nothing about direction, would be very useful for straddles, strangles, or Iron Condor structures.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you for the comments. \n\nJust to clarify the table attached and my 80% accuracy is for the test set values (I.e. the unseen values).

It's more typical to use ITM calls for stock replacement. BTW, you always spell it as LEAPS, because it is an acronym like IRS.\n\n>Since doing this I've noticed that the options prices move in a much more exaggerated fashion than the underlying stock price.\n\nThat is because OTM options are more leveraged than stock shares. If you buy 1 share for $100 and it goes up by $1, that is only a 1% gain. If you buy 1 call on the same stock for $.01 and the call goes up by $1, that is a 100% gain ($1 gain = $.01 gain in premium, since calls are x 100 shares, so $.01 cost basis plus a $.01 gain doubles your money to $.02 total, which is 100%).\n\nBut leverage cuts both ways, so small dollar losses can mean large percentage losses on the OTM call.\n\n>What do I need to know in terms of timing the exit on these positions? If a contract expires in January, and I am at a profit now - or expect to be at a profit eventually - is there a rule of thumb for when I need to exit?\n\nYes, assuming by \"option\" you meant a call. Please write \"call\" instead of option, if you mean call.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/pages/managing\\_long\\_calls](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/pages/managing_long_calls)\n\n>Like if I think a stock is going to pop in September - with a Jan expiry - should I sell much earlier and buy new contracts with a further expiry?\n\nWould you sell the shares just to buy more shares back at a higher price? That doesn't make much sense.\n\n>I just don't want to miss out on taking my profits by waiting too long as I'm used to just hold stocks for years.\n\nYou can solve that problem by defining an exit strategy before you open the trade. A minimal exit strategy defines exit levels, like for profit and loss, and max holding time. Then you just mechanically take the action needed when the call hits any of the predefined levels, regardless of when that happens.\n\nMore about exit strategies here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/pages/mondayschool/yourplan](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/pages/mondayschool/yourplan)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "sort wild thumb wipe fretful fine history arrest rinse one\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)*", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Moneyness of a LEAPS call is a risk/reward trade-off. For stock replacement, getting more delta and higher probability of profit at expiration is desirable and more stock-like, so people typically tend to favor more ITM, even though it costs more and leverage is lower.\n\n> the answer is because these are options and therefore have expirations, so the underlying price isn't the only consideration for when to sell. Which is what my question is about - if you have a LEAPS call, at what point does the expiration date start to become a drag?\n\nYour scenario was a January expiration and a pop expected in the prior September and the old call had a gain. So it's analogous to buying shares for $50, they rise up to $60 in August and you anticipate even more gains in September. You currently have a $50 cost basis, but you want to bank the $10/share profit and sell the old shares for $60. So now you have to buy new share for the September pop and they cost at least $60. Why is that advantageous over just holding the old shares with the $50 cost basis? It's exactly the same for calls. The January expiration is irrelevant, because it's so far in the future. If the expiration was September 20 that would be a different story, but January is not worth worrying about.\n\nIn general, you don't have to worry about expiration until around the last 30 days, give or take, in terms of timing. \n\nIf it is theta decay you are worried about, the total holding time is as much of a concern as how close expiration may be. Theta does increase as you approach expiration, but that won't matter if you hold for a long time. For example, say theta is $.01/day when you are a year from expiration and 10x that ($.10/day) within 30 days of expiration, just as a simplification for illustrative purposes. You plan to hold for 365 days. So in the first 335 days, you will lose $3.35 to theta decay, while you lose another $3.00 in the last 30 days. Even when the rate of decay is low in the beginning, more cumulative days of holding time can add up to a large loss of value also.

CROX 11/3/23 86 strike calls were trading at 0.27 when he bought them, and trading at 1.75 when he sold them.  So he made a profit.\n\nThink of a call option like a retail coupon, like \"1 large pizza at Domino's for $10.  Expires 6/30/24.\"  Now imagine the prices of Domino's pizzas are constantly changing.  Every day, minute by minute, Domino's is changing their prices, so you never know what the price of a Domino's large pizza is going to be later today, let alone tomorrow.  It could be $5, it could be $100.  So there is a very active market for those coupons.  People are constantly trading them, because if the price of a Domino's pizza goes up, it they could become very valuable.\n\nNow imagine that a large pizza at Domino's is currently $8, and those \"1 large pizza for $10. Expires 6/30/24\" coupons are currently being traded for 50 cents.  You buy one for 50 cents.  Now, obviously, it would be ridiculous to use the coupon at this point.  Why would you take that coupon into a Domino's and pay $10 for a large pizza, when you could just buy one without the coupon for $8?\n\nBut then imagine that tomorrow morning, Domino's increases the price of a large pizza to $9.75.  Well, you still wouldn't use the coupon.  But it's suddenly become more valuable!  It looks like the price of Domino's pizza is going up, and even though the coupon isn't worth using yet, it's much closer to being worth using by its expiration date, and the people trading the coupons think therefore it's more likely to become worth using.  So they bid up the price--maybe they start trading that coupon for $1.00.  So now you can sell it for $100 and make a 50 cent profit, because even though a Domino's large pizza still isn't going for $10, it's closer, and thus the coupon market thought that coupon was more valuable.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for the clear explanation.

But when I see the price move on my live chart, sometimes it takes 2 or 3 seconds for the price of the option to reflect that move on think or swim app!!! This is so annoying!! As you know in options seconds count. \n\nSo I\u2019m here to ask the community, what broker do you prefer for options? Especially for trading on mobile.

So the big IV crush is yet to come, but the point I made about how IV distorts the price movement of options is still relevant.

Not sure what you mean by \"non-execution\" also.\n\n>if I short a Call OTM and it goes ATM/ITM, what is my potential loss?\n\nFor all what-if scenarios involving options, you have to say when. Time is always a factor in options trades. The answer to your question changes between a long while before expiration, a short while before expiration, and on expiration.\n\nA long while before expiration, nothing happens usually. However, you might end up in a margin call if the move is so far against you that the maintenance margin exceeds your available buying power. That's still an unrealized loss, though, and it may recover.\n\nA short while before expiration the chance of early exercise increases. If the call goes so far ITM that it has no extrinsic value, or if it is near an ex-dividend date, you could get assigned early. That's not necessarily a bad thing, since you get to keep 100% of the opening premium in an early assignment, but it does leave you with the obligation to deliver shares at the strike price, which usually would happen at a loss. Plus the maintenance margin risk mentioned above.\n\nOn expiration, if the call is even $.01 ITM at close of market, it will be assigned with near 100% certainty. If you have the shares already, they are called away -- whether that is a cap gain or loss will depend on the cost basis of the shares vs. the strike price of the call. If you don't have the shares already, you'll end up short shares. That will initially be for an unrealized loss, but you could recoup the loss if the stock price falls after assignment. Or, if the stock price continues to rise, you could end up with uncapped downside and be in a load of trouble.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": ">On expiration, if the call is even $.01 ITM at close of market, it will be assigned with near 100% certainty.

And if I buy a call on the same date, just at a later point in time, the premium should become smaller too, as long as it is not ITM?\n\nIs that why there are usually 2 P&L lines, one target and one \"end\" P&L?

If you bought the shares at $25, no.\n\n>  And if I buy a call on the same date, just at a later point in time, the premium should become smaller too, as long as it is not ITM?\n\nI don't understand your question. Are you trying to ask if you buy a call with the same expiration date as the short call, but at a point in time after the opening date of the short call but before expiration of both? If so, you'll have to say a lot more, like which strike you are talking about and what underlying stock price did in the intervening time. You can't buy a call of the same strike and expiration as a short call, as that would close the short call, so it has to be a different strike,  unless you also meant a different expiration.\n\n> Is that why there are usually 2 P&L lines, one target and one \"end\" P&L? To simulate the profit generated if I buy back the same option later on to cover?\n\nNo. If there are two lines, the convention is that one line (color) is the forecast P&L if you were to close for that stock price right now, and the other line (different color) is if you were to hold to expiration. There are some calculators that give you a line for each day between now and expiration, or each week if it is far dated.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.8567909002304077}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4901323914527893}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6973358392715454}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.8130548596382141}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.7005101442337036}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5180928707122803}, {"body": "What do you use to see an option's historical pricing chart?\n\nAll providers of such charts have gaps in the middle with not so accurate information.\n\nI was curious as to what you guys are using...\n\nMy guess is that most options are in such low demand, that it is hard to create an accurate graph since the bid/ask price are just too huge...", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "its actually more about data, every stock has thousands of contracts, which all have loads of transactions. simply keeping all that data around is expensive. so banks and brokers tend to not do it, mostly because they have no business case for it.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.15914231538772583}, {"body": ">My guess is that most options are in such low demand, that it is hard to create an accurate graph since the bid/ask price are just too huge...\n\nWrite guess, wrong reason.

Derivatives on the index, like options or futures, can make their own moves, as they tend to be forward-looking of the spot index, but their impact on the constituents is less clear. I wouldn't say there is no impact whatsoever, since sentiment is a thing and institutions may buy or dump entire sectors if one sector leader has a good/bad day in the options market, and the same goes for the index value, like if NASDAQ 100 rallies, someone who has been waiting to make a big buy of just MSFT calls might elect to do so due to the favorable move of the index as a whole.

Here's the story. I bought GME shares a long while back (1.5yrs ago) around $25 cost basis, thinking it was \"due for a bounce,\" and quickly went underwater. Every time it's had a \"big\" day, like around 10% gains, I sell monthly covered calls against my position and enjoy the little returns on premium. I haven't done it in a while because the premiums have been so small.... until last week. On 5/3 when it jumped up to the teens, I sold covered calls with $23 strikes (because it was the highest in the option chain at the time) for 5/24 expiry, and made a couple thousand in premium. Now I'm looking at my play and feeling like a complete dumbass. I didn't have enough cash on-hand in the account to close out the CC's when it was already at $25. I was going to just sell the underlying shares at $23 and use the funds to close out the CC position and then buy back the shares, but my account wouldn't let me because I had those shares already attached to the CC. I'm now learning that I could have called Schwab and they could have done that for me over the phone, but now it's a little late for that since price is around $50 and the calls that I sold are well ITM.\n\nAny recommendations on how to unwind this position and still make money off this trade?", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "In one order, sell the shares and buy the calls.\n\n\n.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nOr attempt to buy the calls and sell new calls in one order, for a net of zero or small credit while rasing the strike price\u00a0 few dollars, keeping the expiration to less than 60 days.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4926352798938751}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4658564329147339}, {"body": "I keep losing money getting orders filled.
