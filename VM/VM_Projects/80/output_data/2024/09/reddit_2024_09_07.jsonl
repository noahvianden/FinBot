I have about $600K sitting in cash that I can deploy. Thinking of buying 2400 more shares Monday morning at $102 (or whatever it opens at). So I will have 6000 with a net cost of about $110. I could then sell 60 covered call contracts below:\n\nOCT18\n$110 SP =  $30,450 premium\n$115 SP = $20,700 premium\n$120 SPM = $14,220 premium\n\n\nNOV15\n$115 SP = 34,050 premium\n$120 SP = 25,950 premium\n$125 SP = 20,100 premium\n\nWhat would you do if you owned 3600 shares at $116? Would you buy more to lower your AVG cost? Then sell CCs against these? One theory I have is that the market is going to be pretty funky through the election, so maybe just sell Nov CCs, which expire after the election but before the next earnings date.  \n\nI\u2019ve also been selling puts to make a little premium and pick up shares at the price I want but the premium is not much and it ties up my $ until the ED. \n\n\n\n\n", "id": "1fb7i3p", "created_utc": 1725717440.0, "score": 20, "upvote_ratio": 0.71, "num_comments": 91, "comments": [{"body": "It sounds like you may be trying to cover unrealized losses by continuing to trade the asset.

Now with nvidia which is controlling the market a lot, would you recommend applying stop losses in those trades as well? I feel like same thing which happened in 2022 with most of the tech stocks can happen again or already happening in past couple of weeks.

In the case of the OP with an entry price of 116 it would have lowered his Average cost to 92.55 Well above the current price and at a good level of support. Selling OTM calls to finance a put while collecting extra revenue is the optimum strategy.  You can continue to use this to lower your average price while protecting your investment. If you don't hold 100 shares, you can still buy a put and rely on traditional trailing stops stop limit orders set above your entry, they won't protect you of course during pre market or after hour dumps but the goal is to exit in profit.   \nOptions provide an opportunity to protect your investments as well as to make money. When used cautiously they are a great addition to a portfolio. Chips are very cyclical and always have volatility, that is part of the risk reward of trading them. Markets and market sectors all experience their up and downs dictated by the cycle of the economy and specific sector issues. I personally like to invest some of my portfolio into out of favor sectors small/mid cap and real estate healthcare are just a few examples of things I have bought over the last year I already bought utilities when they were cheap and during the october lows leading into december I bought into tech. I seperate day trading and speculation from long term holdings. Cutting losers early accumulating shares at lower prices allow you to hold during downturns in companies you plan to hold for a longtime. I remember very clearly NVDA and AAPL being very out of favor and sold down by short sellers and the large market participants only for them to buy at the prices they knocked the shares down to. AAPL went from 200 to 160 and they were telling people it would be a 60 dollar stock  gain they at the same time were buying the stock.
