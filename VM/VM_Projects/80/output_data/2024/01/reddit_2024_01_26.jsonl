{"title": "Management All in FSD; Investors too", "selftext": "After watching Omar videos, this thought came to me last night with conviction and I had hard time sleeping with excitement.\n\nTable of contents:\n1) Why I think management is all in:\n2) Current problems\n3) How FSD solves the problems\n\n#1\n- They refer themselves as AI company. AI = autonomous driving. Invested in dojo/ infrastructure/ talent acquisition.\n- Elon was going to not even include steering wheel for next gen.\n- Included cameras in all cars\n- Keep removing parts useful for actual driving\n- Willing to sell cars at expense of margin.\n- Limited model variety compared to competitors.\n- Elon likes to say Tesla one day be biggest company by market cap. That requires special operating leverage (not hardware sales).\n\n#2\n- Not ideal car for actual driving especially for older people (and there will only be more of them with time). No USS, birdeye view, no dash display/ HUD, regen brake, too much touch screen, no stalks. Abled drivers can overcome them, but not welcoming for older people. This restricts TAM.\n- Stock is too expensive for just low margin hardware business with limited operating leverage (EV/ megapacks).\n- Limited model variety limits TAM.\n\n#3\n- The chatgpt moment will be when general public becomes convinced their old parents and young teenagers need fsd, while taking on liability as driver. No new laws needed. FSD doesnt have to be perfect in all edge cases. It just has to be enough for drivers to subscribe.\n- Complete overhaul of business and operating leverage. No extra expense. Just pure monthly subscription. SAAS business overnight. So in this way, the current discussion about ads and margin is myopic.\n- Increase in demand. Immediate increase in TAM. Significant value to people that value safety. People care less about car model variety. Almost a monopoly overnight. \n- Immediate boost to tesla insurance. High risk drivers pay premium in insurance. If they use fsd, they are not high risk. Another operating leverage.\n- hertz/ used car/ rental market immediately recover. You would want fsd if thats what are used to.\n\nWhen we say Tesla is AI company, run by best management with best talent, we are essentially investing in them figuring this out.\n\nThat\u2019s how I think of it anyways.

Within the field, most people are much more skeptical. The problem is reliability. A safety critical system, like FSD, has to be incredibly reliable. Showing rates of failure around one mistake every few million miles. FSD, on the other hand, makes mistakes about every 5-10 miles, on average. And no, there's not some \"exponential\" take off in AI. Instead, it's showing convergence at that level. And no, just throwing more data won't fix that problem, because it's already operating at the limits of the current hardware and sensors.\n\nRealistically, a truly go anywhere attention off/no driver autonomous system is at least a generation away. We'll likely get semi-autonomous highway systems (attention off, but still in the drivers seat) around the end of this decade. But the kind of system Musk keeps describing as coming \"next year\" is still far off.
