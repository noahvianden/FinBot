So no mortgage. (Just an hoa fee but that also covers water and trash and all outdoor stuff plus the roof and most insurance for pipe leaks and stuff.)\n\nI wouldn\u2019t trade back to having a mortgage just to have one (I will prob have a small one (payments under $1200) when we finally upgrade to a larger house.)\n\nI know *mathematically* it may make sense to take on a loan and invest at a higher rate than your mortgage, but I don\u2019t believe that investing and life are really just math. \n\nFor example. When covid hit we didn\u2019t flinch at an income hit because the worst that was going to happen was our internet would be canceled if we didn\u2019t pay our bills. But our emergency fund was enough that we could have hunkered down for 3 years without income if all we had to pay was the very basics. Our expenses could be well under $1000/month total if we needed it to be for a time. \n\nLoss of income timed with sharp drop in investment value and it might leave people overstretched playing the math game. It\u2019s not unlikely that the investments may not be there to cash out to carry you through the crisis. \n\nI would prefer not to use credit cards either but my husband won\u2019t keep track of expenses and rather than giving him access to the debit card I just pay off the credit card each month. It\u2019s not my ideal way as i still consider short term debt that I have enough cash to cover to be a negative thing. \n\nI\u2019ve also had family emergencies (a newborn in the hospital for 6 months) and we were not financially stable then. We had a lot of debt and juggled paycheck to paycheck. It was rough. I did not get to spend enough time with him and I did not get to take off enough time to process or grieve. If god forbid something like that happened again it would be very different with the ability to put our lives on hold and prioritize differently without the very real fear of becoming homeless in the meantime. We also wouldn\u2019t have to try to sell off investments etc. \n\nPlus not having a mortgage opens up hundreds of dollars to save or spend each month. Without other debt your mortgage prob won\u2019t last a full 15 years and then you can have shit tons of money to invest. \n\nPaying down the mortgage is also a sort of \u201ctangible\u201d goal that you can watch the number go down and get motivated to pay it faster as the number shrinks\n\nUnless you are buying like G Em Ee or a stock you\u2019re motivated about, you probably aren\u2019t hustling hard to throw extra money at investments vs going w a predetermined flow/plan. Motivation to finish off that mortgage can really spur things along. We paid most of our mortgage value (over 60%) in the last 3 years vs the first 4 and got out of our loan 8 years early. So I\u2019m not sure how much extra beneficial it is to carry a mortgage much longer than you would otherwise if you just killed it on the mortgage in 8 years instead of 15. Then the amount you can invest is huge and you\u2019ll probably make up the mathematical difference in keeping a mortgage and buying investment. Or it\u2019d be so close in amount that the stress of overextending for the tax benefit wasn\u2019t worth it all those years. \n\nAnyway; thanks for coming to my Ted talk!", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Ha!
