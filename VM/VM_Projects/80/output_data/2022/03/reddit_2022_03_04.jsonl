{"title": "Russian economy is experiencing 'crack-up boom' now", "selftext": "Within a matter of week the Russian economy seems to have entered the disastrous inflationary stage that the Austrian economists described as the crack-up boom.\n\nThe crack-up boom occurs in the inflationary environment when the public opinion comes to the realization that the inflation will not be stopped and the purchasing power of their cash holdings will continue to decrease. In such a situation, people start to buy as much as they can and decrease their cash holding to a minimum. This, in its turn, increases the supply of money further more and decreases the demand for money, which accelerates price increases and fall in the purchasing power of money. The economy and the public enter a vicious cycle, and soon people become desperate to get rid of money and try to obtain what they consider \u201creal good\u201d. Thus, in a very short time, once widely used money becomes to be perceived as worthless, and soon there is no one left who wants to accept it in exchange of giving up \u201creal goods\u201d.\n\nInterestingly enough, the key is not the inflation itself, but the public\u2019s anticipation of the inflation.\n\nThis is the reason why for a very long time the economy can stay in inflation and be reasonably stable, as, even though people may realize they are losing purchasing power, the mere fact that they anticipate the inflation to end and prices go down, will be enough for them to hold or even increase their cash holdings.\n\nThe Russian economy has been experiencing inflation for a very long time, however it was the moment when the war started and the sanctions were introduced when the Russian public realized their rubles will start to lose their purchasing power indefinitely and the Russian crack-up boom started within a few days.\n\nAnalyzing what happened to Russia is easy now. Everybody is watching Russia with close eyes, so close that it seems many missed J. Powell\u2019s recent comments where he said he sees only 0,25% increase in the interest rates in March as appropriate, while the official American CPI number is expected to print above 8%\u2026\n\nSo far the Fed has done a great job of convincing people that inflation is transitory and/or it is under the Fed\u2019s control\u2026But the question is when the American public will realize that the Fed cannot and does not want to fight inflation?", "id": "t6w2mv", "created_utc": 1646436883.0, "score": 88, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 83, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|14|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|100|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=t6w2mv)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=t6w2mv)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.21612299978733063}, {"body": "I\u2019m gonna wait for Cramer\u2019s opinion.
