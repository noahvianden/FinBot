You know many folks think it'll go up, but you don't think it will for some time. You sell covered calls at a strike of 200 and earn the premium. It pops up to 229 as it has in the past few weeks. Your shares are called away and you miss out on a 29 per share increase in the stock price. \n\nYou made a small premium, but missed out on a big jump. That jump could have happened after your covered call expiry, in which case you'd win. But it didn't. \n\nIf you're selling covered calls on growth stocks, you're going to make more premium but you're going to miss out on bigger growth opportunities. \n\nIf you sell covered calls on value stocks that tend to trade within a tight band, you won't make much premium because the implied volatility is so low - so even though the likelihood of the stock increasing is much lower, so is the amount you earn from selling a covered call option. \n\nSelling covered calls also adds complexity and costs. So if I was you, I'd consider buying and holding long term and actually benefit from the growth in stock, instead of selling away that growth for a small premium. That way you keep the growth opportunity for yourself, without any costs other than the original transaction fee for the stock purchase. \n\nThere's another factor that your options premiums are taxed as short term capital gains - in other words, ordinary income. If you hold a stock for longer than a year, not only do you benefit from the growth, but your gains are taxed as long term capital gains. \n\nThe problem is that this approach requires patience, a willingness to defer gratification, which is difficult for most people, and does not involve much trading activity, which is also a problem for folks who want to think of themselves as \"traders\". \n\nYMMV.

Wait a little while after the split, because chances are, the stock will initially rip up before it settles into a normal pattern.  If the stock goes up, roll over your calls to a later date.

As I begin to type this comment, that seems high to me, but I could be missing something.\n\nIn 2021, Tesla had 13.8B in gross automotive profit (auto revenue vs auto COGS).\n\nSo, from a sanity check, 1.6M deliveries is 71% growth over 2021's 936,222 deliveries. I definitely think that is a reasonable total. In fact I think it's a bit conservative depending on how badly the Shanghai shutdowns continue to affect Tesla.\n\n71% growth in gross auto profit at the same ASP and margins would be $23.6B. If Energy and Services (which includes used car sales revenue) each break even, you'd have 23.6B in gross profit.\n\nExtrapolating R&D CAGR from 2019 - 2021 linearly gives us R&D of 3.2B. I'll increase it just a bit more to 3.5B to be very conservative. CAGR growth with SG&A gives us 5.4B. However, we must remember there are saving of almost 1.5 B from Elon's compensation package there, YoY. I'll only take .5B off (as they are hiring lots of new folks) and you get operating expenses of 3.5 + 4.9 = $8.4B.\n\nOperating income of 23.6 - 8.4B = 15.2B.\n\n* I don't anticipate Bitcoin impairment losses this year as Bitcoin would have to drop below like 29k or something to cause that.\n* Other income/expense is mostly related to financial charges or earnings. It seems to fluctuate year to year. With the worsening macro conditions, I'll say they spend $150M on this. $15.05B.\n* Net interest was 315M last year but should be down this year as they've paid off debt in 2021 and I'd anticipate they'll do the same this year. I'll still give them $275M in interest paid, which is probably too much. $14.775B.\n* $1B provision for taxes as they are in Europe now and have another plant in the US. Last year they spent $700M. Now income is down to 13.775B.\n* Non controlling interests (securitized auto and solar loans owned by VIEs) get $200M skimmed off the top. Was 125M last year.\n* Net income to common shareholders: **13.57B.** That's just extrapolating out last year's $50,450 ASP and 29% gross margin. Any improvements in either figure will boost that profit. There should be an ASP improvement just based on selling more S/X vehicles, as well as higher prices across the board, as well as front loading FSD optioned vehicles.\n\n\\[2 hours later\\]\n\nHmm, maybe you are right. I had to dig into this more, so I created the following chart. understand this is definitely a rough estimate, but it gives a good overview.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/YvI6jEu](https://imgur.com/a/YvI6jEu)\n\nYellow = net profit of $15 - 20B; Green = net profit of 16.5 - 18.5B\n\nFor instance, an ASP of just $55k with 31% gross margins will net $17.26B in profit (given the previous assumptions).\n\nAn ASP of $59k with 29% margins (no improvement over 2021) will net $17.35B in profit.\n\nAn ASP of %57k and 33% margins @ 1.6M deliveries would yield $20.1B....wow\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT also note this assumes energy + service breakeven.
