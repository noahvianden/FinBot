It's just doesn't seem likely that these highs will hold. Inflation is a monster and at the same time yields are shooting up. The Fed is way behind on increasing the rates and the bond market is literally running in the opposite direction. If you think the rout has been in equities this year then you are wrong. It's the bonds that have performed worse than the equities. Sooner or later, equities will catch up too. Along with all this, this is the first year since 2020 that people are looking forwards to the summer. There will be rampant spending with record low unemployment levels fueling inflation even more. Powell doesn't want to puncture the labor markets but increasing the rates at quicker pace will exactly do that. \n\nHaving said all this, I don't have a magic ball and don't know how this is all going to end.
