Inflation is a problem, and it\u2019s one that we need to address, but I don\u2019t expect a recession in the United States,\u201d the Treasury secretary said.\n\nYellen also said she believed that the Federal Reserve could achieve a \u201csoft landing\u201d for the economy -- taming inflation without triggering a recession.\n\nBy: Christopher Condon (Bloomberg)\nMarch 10, 2022, 2:26 PM PST", "id": "tbh52f", "created_utc": 1646970516.0, "score": 75, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 85, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|37|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|1970|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=tbh52f)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=tbh52f)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.18080411851406097}, {"body": "She just wants time to liquidate her portfolio before she scares everyone....lol", "score": 87, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.24989470839500427}, {"body": "That GD reptile!
