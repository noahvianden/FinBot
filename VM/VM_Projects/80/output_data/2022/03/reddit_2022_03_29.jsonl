Also, Teslas come with a long warranty \u2014 so \"reliability\" shouldn't be in doubt, or if it is, it shouldn't be an issue.

Though, 2 caveats: total cost of ownership after purchase is less for EVs than for ICE (after purchase .... with current Tesla prices, it's probably not enough, especially with FSD). And also, it's hard to compare price parity between Tesla and other EVs without knowing whether those other EVs are compliance cars or are actually profitable. Tesla doesn't have to worry about being outcompeted by a cheaper car if scaling up those sales puts the manufacturer out of business.\n\nGuess we'll see what happens!

Setting that aside.\n\nI live in Europe. Wether build quality matters may be a survey question, which I cant answer directly. What I can say is even the cheapest cars built in the EU are better at this than teslas.\n\nA dacia sandero does not have panel gaps where I can fit a whole finger. It does not have visible areas with stuff glued together. The noise inside the car is also lower than in a tesla. Electric motors create less noise than a petrol engine, but the noise insulation is so bad that the sound level is higher in a tesla than in a sandero. There is as much road and air noise in a tesla 3 than there is in my track car, and that one had its noise isolation removed.\n\nAlso these dacia are as cheap as you can go. They are 7.000\u20ac cars, not 55.000\u20ac (price of a tesla 3 here).\n\nUS customers certainly do not care much about this, probably because cars are much cheaper there, but europeans clearly do or they would not build their cars that way.\n\nThe tesla 3 and the zoe are at the top of the charts because they are basically the only real full electric options. The tesla 3 because they are good cars, despite their poor build quality, the zoe because it is also offered without the batteries (you can loan them for a monthly fee depending on distance), and they also provide you with a petrol car 3 or 4 times a year for long travels.\n\nI'd honestly have a tesla 3 if it did not cost that much, and if I could actually use it as my \"only daily car\" (i already have a track car, cant have 3 cars XD ). I would not care about a poor finish if the car was 30K, and I am one of the few people that do not care about that kind of thing. But its price is 55K. And I have to admit, it still is worth it. Tesla probably dont make a lot of money off that.\n\nThere is currently something lacking on the EV market, something tesla was supposed to do with the 3, but did not.\n\nIt lacks a moderately powered, cheap EV with long range and comfort.\n\nI dont care about massive speed and acceleration, i already have a track toy for that. I dont care about self driving and the tons of software in there, heck i dont want that big screen either. I dont care about its shape looking like a regular car with a blocked off grille.\n\nI want a simple electric car that does not require me to wear earplugs, which can do 400km driving at highway speed with air conditioning, radio and lighting the road. And I want that cheap.\n\nThe main issue is I live in a big city, and if I want to go to the next big one ... I just cant. No charger on the highway. I'd have to leave the highway to get ONE, and it is just a regular charger. Chances it will be either not working or have tons of people waiting, since it it is the only one near that highway.\n\nif i want to go visit  my parents who are even further, I use another highway that has exactly ONE charging station. Same issue, and that means I need the long range version too.\n\nThis really is the problem with electric cars in Europe.
