I would ride it a lot more if it had the boring company's average of 15 **second** wait time. I would ride my local light rail a lot more if it went to more places. I would take my local light rail more if it had longer hours of operation. I would ride it more if the average speed was higher. however, even if they improved those things, it's not going to increase ridership enough to make the construction or operating cost per passenger low enough to justify the cost to taxpayers. \n\nthe US isn't \"behind the EU\", they are different places so what works in what will not necessarily work in the other. US cities have less density, petrol prices are lower, motorway infrastructure is better, class stratification is different, etc. etc.. all of those things have an impact on the viability of different modes of transportation. one should not ignore the differences and assume that what works in Europe also must work in the US. ignoring differences is why the US has built so many poorly performing transit lines and has ended up without much support from the general public. the US's biggest failing with regard to transit is trying to too closely copy Europe. that's the whole point of the boring company's Loop system; to make transportation that is fit to it's purpose rather than trying to copy-paste a design that was successful in a dramatically different environment. \n\nplaces with ridership above what the boring company can already handle would be well served to build a subway line and use Loop to feed passengers into the line. that way, the lower ridership corridors can be handled by the lower capacity system, and all of the riders can converge into a system that can support the higher ridership. that is the most cost-effective way to get the most coverage. places with lower ridership, like the corridor in which Phoenix wants to build their light rail extension, can directly use Loop into the city center and not as a feeder line.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I'm not qualified enough to argue, especially about country where I never have been before.
