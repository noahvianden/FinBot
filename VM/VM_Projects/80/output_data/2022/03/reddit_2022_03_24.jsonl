Another comparison is Kodak.    Didn't move quickly enough to the new tech in order to protect it's film and camera business.    Didn't realize that the change would come far faster then they realized.    It is the problem that any legacy company has when trying to make a transitions to something new.    Your business is built on the old and when you indicate you are moving to the new why would anyone want to buy the old?   So they sit on the fence far too long when  they should have taken the pain and just changed earlier.    By the time they realize they need to change they can't do it quickly enough and they turn into a shadow of their former selves.   But this is what happens when you have execs worried more about quarterly results and stock price then what is happening 2 or 3 years from now.    Many of them will be long gone with their money before the crap really hits the fan.    So there is no push to change.   And if you do want to change you have to fight with unions, dealers, suppliers and 1000 other things.   None of this will be easy just because they are an existing company.

Great little car and didn't have any issues with it.   Was a 3 year lease.   But the main issues were the dealers.   Since I was new to EVs I was hesitant and they sensed that.   So everything was geared to try and get me to buy a gas powered car.     It became clear that they just didn't want to sell an EV which become even clearer after purchase.\n\nBut largely the issue is all the problems you have with gas cars x 10 at dealers for EVs.    In the case of Nissan they said you needed a battery check once a year to maintain warranty and that for the first 3 years that is free.   It became clear the reason for this was to get you back in the dealership to try and upsell you on every service they could.      Since they need limited maintenance dealers know they aren't going to get you coming back over and over with an EV so they would rather you buy a gas car.  If you do buy an EV they will work you over to try and do service you don't really need like a brake fluid flush when the car was only 1 year old.\n\nOnce I bought, and went through the Tesla process, it is hard not to see the problems traditional automotive will have with dealers.   And you can see them trying to deal with that already with the moves made by VW, Ford and GM.     The car itself was fine but just a car.   It didn't feel next gen.    So the Leaf just felt like any other car that happened to be an EV.    A tesla feels like a different thing.   I have described it as the difference between a flip phone and a smart phone.   It just feels new and more advanced.\n\nSo basically traditional auto has all the problems of trying to maintain the legacy when EVs don't actually need that.   The dealer problem is a massive one and not something that is going to be easy to overcome.   And the cars. up until recently from them,  have felt like afterthoughts where they just made a gas car electric.   A great example is the online experience for the leaf.  You had an app to preheat and do all those things but it was brutally bad.   Half the time I wouldn't connect to the car and it became so frustrating that I just stopped trying to use it.
