A Fed bailout is not a bull case for a company, and when the company is a tech company that relies on innovation and disruption for its stock in trade, it is the most bearish thing imaginable.\n\nSee, Intel's problem has not been an inability to access capital.  It could get as much capital as it wanted in the bond markets at very favorable rates, for the last 10 years, without interruption.\n\nThe problem is they can't innovate or disrupt.  They've revised their roadmap 13 times since 2005 and they still can't meet it.  They've gone from tick-tock to tick-tock-tuck to tick-tock-we're-fucked. They've been thoroughly leapfrogged by their main competitors - AMD for CPUs, ARM for architecture, TSMC for fab/miniaturization, nVidia for parallel, QCOM for SOC/embeds - and they're not talking about overtaking, they're aiming 5 years from now to be where their competitors are now.\n\nThey are literally fuk.
