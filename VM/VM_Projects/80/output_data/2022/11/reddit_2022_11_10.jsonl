Except, the listings suck because there's different numbers  (3M VHB tape) yet none of the listings tell me which model the tape is. Affects temperature and surface adhesion types. It's important, but whatever. It's also weirdly low reviews so I start reading. Maybe they got the wrong type considering none tell you product line info and are all in broken English.\n\nI'm looking and people say it's clearly been repackaged, doesn't have the markings from 3M, doesn't stick to anything, etc. I'm thinking, there's a black market for knock-off tape?! So I scroll through and go, okay, I don't want to redo this project if my tape fails and melts in 6 months. Nope. I need high heat, hence VHB tape. (Good to 200F, which I'm only expecting around 120-140F but tape in stores only guarantees up to 100F.)\n\nSo, I go and find it at another store, it's only $10 more and they're an industrial/ construction supply company and it's not knock-off, off brand shit.\n\nI did the same thing when buying stuff for my puppy.

Sold and shipped by Amazon, from their warehouse. She sent that shit back because, uh, excuse me a 3 inch wide strip in the middle of my filter is a significant reduction in filter power. Two taped together to make the right size isn't the same as an actual air filter of that size.\n\nThey've let their once useful 'one stop shop' marketplace die by not cracking down on fake reviews, counterfeit items and have become a cheap import dropshippers clearinghouse.", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "Man I just went through this with buying a RC car for an adopt a family program.

It was relatively easy for Amazon to capture the e-commerce space as a first mover and become a near monopoly.\n\nMost of these companies were able to sustain their high growth through fist mover advantages in high growth industries that had little competition and huge consumer demand.
