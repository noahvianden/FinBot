{"title": "Recession indicator: U.S. shrinking container freight shows slipping consumer spending on merchandise", "selftext": "LONDON, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Container freight volumes at the largest U.S. ports were down 3.8% in September compared with the same month a year earlier, confirming the slackening of merchandise trade and downturn in the business cycle.\n\nThe ports of New York-New Jersey, Los Angeles, Long Beach, Savannah, Houston, Norfolk, Charleston, Seattle and Oakland account for the overwhelming majority of container ocean freight into and out of the United States. The total volume of loaded containers handled by these nine ports amounted to 2.67 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) in September 2022, down from 2.77 million in September 2021 and 2.85 million in September 2020.\n\nThe same slowdown was evident on the railroads, where the number of containers originated fell to 1.09 million in September 2022 from 1.14 million in September 2021 and 1.22 million in September 2020. Parcel delivery services have experienced an even steeper drop; FedEx reported U.S. deliveries were down by around 10% in the three months from June to August compared with a year earlier.\n\nChartbook: [**U.S. container trade**](https://tmsnrt.rs/3EC3xz1)\n\nFreight is reflecting a significant slowdown in consumer spending on merchandise over the last 12-15 months as economies have re-opened after the pandemic and spending has rotated to travel and other services. Real consumer spending on merchandise in the three months from July to September 2022 was down by around 3.5% compared with the peak between April and June 2021, after adjusting for normal seasonal variations.\n\nU.S. manufacturers reported barely any increase in activity in October, with the weakest reading in the Institute for Supply Management\u2019s business survey since the pandemic and before that the mid-cycle slowdown in 2015/16.\n\nThe economies of the United Kingdom and the euro zone have already slipped into recession during the third quarter of 2022 and China\u2019s manufacturing activity is contracting.\n\nU.S. manufacturers and the rest of the economy is following the same trajectory, albeit the slowdown is likely to be shallower and shorter than in other regions which are more exposed to high energy prices and the conflict in Ukraine. \n\nAs the global manufacturing sector contracts, freight volumes are likely to shrink further, which will eventually relieve some of the pressure on diesel fuel supplies.\n\nSource: [Column: U.S. container freight is shrinking: Kemp](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-container-freight-is-shrinking-kemp-2022-11-16/)", "id": "yxdn8w", "created_utc": 1668651359.0, "score": 289, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 86, "comments": [{"body": "I shouldn't have wished on that monkey's paw that the supply chain problems went away.", "score": 105, "replies": [{"body": "Now it comes the reversed supply chain problem, demand < supply.

We overbought because we were told by our suppliers we wouldn't have anything if we didn't (due to sUpPlY ChAiN) and our industry also experienced an actual increase in sales due to the pandemic, but that increase was unsustainable.  We also overbought because they warned that prices would increase:  as if they weren't actually the ones with their fingers on the switch to raise prices (just some abstract entity called \"inflation\").     \n\n\nUnfortunately, we bought in to the narrative and it appears everyone else did too, so it's going to be a race to the bottom as far as pricing goes over the next year or so.  MAP (minimum advertised price) requirements are being dropped and/or not enforced across the industry.  All of this was our suppliers getting ahead of things and making sure they weren't holding the bag.  There never was a true  shortage.  The stuff we ordered to protect ourselves kept coming in.  The very \"inflation\" they created/initiated has raised prices too high for consumers and simultaneously, there aren't enough people to buy the stuff anyways.  Our inventory is probably double to triple what it used to be.  Lesson learned:  \"lack of supply doesn't mean there will be increased demand.\"  \n\n\nNext step is that we, and everyone else won't be able to place our annual reorder requirements with our suppliers so there will be fewer dealers and the suppliers won't have as many people to sell to either.  We'll be left with a crapload of stuff we can't sell and no one to sell it to at any price.  Then we'll have to lay off employees.

It\u2019s that everyone started buying the stuff all at once and drawing down savings to compete against each other on these goods that cause the crazy supply chain issues.
