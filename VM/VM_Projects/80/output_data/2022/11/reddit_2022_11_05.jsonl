{"title": "Berkshire Hathaway posts quarterly loss in Q3/2022", "selftext": "Nov 5 (Reuters) -\n\nWarren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc on Saturday posted a third-quarter loss, as falling stock investments  and a big loss from Hurricane Ian offset improvement in many of its industrial businesses. Berkshire also took advantage of declining equity  markets to buy more stocks, purchasing a net $3.7 billion in the quarter and building a now 20.9% stake in Occidental Petroleum Corp. It also repurchased $1.05 billion of its own stock. The Omaha,  Nebraska-based conglomerate nonetheless said it still sees \"significant disruptions\" in supply chains, while rising inflation hurt results at two of its best-known businesses, the BNSF railroad and Geico auto insurer. \n\nBerkshire posted a quarterly net loss of $2.69 billion, or  $1,832 per Class A share, compared with a profit of $10.34 billion, or  $6,882 per share, a year earlier.\n\nOperating profit rose 20% to $7.76 billion, or about $5,294 per Class A share,  from $6.47 billion, or about $4,331 per share, a year earlier.\n\nResults were bolstered by the strengthening U.S. dollar, which added $858  million to the value of Berkshire's non-dollar denominated debt, and  higher revenue from energy, manufacturing and building products  businesses. That helped offset a $2.7 billion after-tax loss from Ian, a  strong Category 4 hurricane that slammed into Florida on Sept. 28,  causing damages estimated by insurance modelers and executives that could far exceed $50 billion. Profit at BNSF fell 6% as expenses jumped  by one-third, including an 80% surge in fuel costs. Geico, meanwhile,  suffered its fifth straight quarterly underwriting loss, reflecting  \"significant cost inflation\" from damages claims, used car prices and  shortages of car parts. Net results included $10.45 billion of losses from investments and derivatives, as the stock prices of many large Berkshire investments fell. Accounting rules require Berkshire to report  the changes even if it buys and sells nothing. This causes large  quarterly swings in results that Buffett says are usually meaningless.", "id": "ymvbpp", "created_utc": 1667658054.0, "score": 514, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 79, "comments": [{"body": "Brk.A news don't hit the same, a loss of 1832.00$ per share.", "score": 237, "replies": [{"body": "Unrealized.", "score": 42, "replies": [{"body": "I didn't realize it either until I saw the news.", "score": 71, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.02262791059911251}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.14828364551067352}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5190035700798035}, {"body": "Unrealized loss doesn't matter.   \n>Operating profit rose 20% to $7.76 billion, or about $5,294 per Class A share, from $6.47 billion, or about $4,331 per share, a year earlier.    \n\nthat's important", "score": 193, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 70, "replies": [{"body": "Not really, they own a lot of boomer and energy stocks which have done well in this environment.", "score": -7, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "Oh shit my bad, misread the comment.
