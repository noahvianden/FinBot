{"title": "The recession indicator is flashing! U.S. Treasuries are inverted to a degree not seen in 40 years", "selftext": "On Thursday, Powell\u2019s hawkish remarks sent the inversion of the 2-year and 10-year U.S. Treasury yields as high as 58.6 basis points, the highest level since the early 1980s.\n\nThe U.S. bond market is sounding a resounding recession warning.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn Thursday, after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell hinted that the peak rate of interest rates may exceed previous expectations, the 2-year U.S. Treasury yield soared as much as 12 basis points to about 4.74%, the highest level since 2007; The inversion of Treasury yields briefly reached 58.6 basis points, the highest level since the early 1980s, when the Fed was also aggressively tightening policy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAn inversion of the curve means investors expect policy tightening to lead to a recession, while also lowering inflation, boosting demand for longer-dated bonds.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn August 10, the U.S. Treasury bond yields of these two maturities also inverted by more than 58 basis points. The last time U.S. Treasury yields inversion of this magnitude was about 40 years ago, when Volcker, then the chairman of the Federal Reserve, raised interest rates sharply to curb inflation, a move that sent the U.S. economy into a tailspin. History shows that a recession will occur within 12 to 18 months of an inverted yield curve.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFed Chairman Jerome Powell said on Wednesday that policy rates could rise more than previously expected and remain high as the central bank seeks to continue fighting inflation, before stocks fell and policy-sensitive 2-year U.S. Treasury yields continued to rise. Powell said the Fed has a long way to go to keep interest rates at \"restrictive\" levels.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA team led by Priya Misra, head of global rates strategy at TD Securities, wrote in a note:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe believe that the current yield curve may continue to invert as the Fed is likely to continue raising rates and tolerate some economic slowdown.\n\nThis more aggressive-than-expected path of rate hikes has an unfortunate consequence. The actual level of tightening we currently expect could lead to a recession in the second half of 2023.\n\nThe Fed's consideration of raising its peak rate forecast is due to labor market resilience and the prospect of inflation continuing into next year. Ahead of the December FOMC meeting, there are also two CPI data and two nonfarm payrolls reports that will show inflationary pressures and labor market tightness, respectively.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnalysts believe any strong data to follow will lead to higher U.S. Treasury yields and more curve inversions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCurrently, the gap between the 3-month and 18-month Treasury yields is also near inversion. Powell has said the Fed tends to use that yield spread as a predictor of meeting rate cut conditions.", "id": "ylluw6", "created_utc": 1667527406.0, "score": 154, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 80, "comments": [{"body": "My S7 book told me 2 consecutive quarters of negative GDP means we\u2019re in a recession.
