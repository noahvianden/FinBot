Remember that investing, not gambling (which is more commonplace here) is looking long term, and deciding if this company will be worth more in 5-10 years. If your answer is yes, invest! If no, look elsewhere. Gambling is closer to buying options, which is usually (here) via yolo, which is a bit different when it comes to the overall mindset and thought process, since it is typically shorter term \u201cin and out\u201d if you will, so you want to bet on catalysts that can cause large swings in the stock price and buy options that will allow you to profit off of it. \n\nAlso, the idea that \u201cother manufacturers are also developing EV\u2019s\u201d is a poor argument for why Tesla is a bad buy. It\u2019s like saying Apple can\u2019t make money because Samsung is pushing new smartphones\u2026 There are 4 billion people+ who will want an EV in the future. If Tesla sells to 5% of those people, pushes Tesla\u2019s to more businesses like hertz and other enterprise companies and eventually makes lower cost EV\u2019s that\u2019s a lot more money down the road that they can make; AND a lot of market cap to fill. Currently there is more demand than there are Tesla cars and it will take time to catch up to demand, so, a lot more growth is coming still. \n\nWhen you buy a stock you should always look at future potential. Tesla is definitely not going to sit around twiddling it\u2019s thumbs doing nothing for 5 years lol It\u2019s going to enter new markets like semi\u2019s and trucks and push B2B and B2C relationships in new industries and so on and so forth. If you limit your views and how and where Tesla can and will go it probably will be hard to see it\u2019s potential. \n\nAnyways, Tesla is still getting started so that\u2019s why I invest/gamble.
