People need to learn what supply/demand is. That's your answer.\n\n1. The economy is projected to go through a recession. This is across the world.\n2. People start pulling money out of the market. Why? They need the money for food, rent, housing, car payments, etc., How many people do you know put money they desperately need in the stock market? Very few. It's usually extra income they toss into it. Some are pulling money out of the market because they believe it will continue dropping further and don't want to hold the bag... causing more shares to be sold at lower prices. Fewer buyers = shares get sold at a lower price to compensate for the lower demand.\n3. FED is increasing rates. This means no more cheap money. AKA, growth is going to decline because companies can't borrow cheap money to expand their business as easily. This is why you are seeing companies with absurd valuations with no ability to generate cash flow get absolutely burned. Cash is king because right now, everyone wants cash whether to borrow, make payments, etc., No one wants your 10,000 shares of Amazon if they can get the equivalent in cash. If the company you are investing in isn't cash flow positive, you should evaluate whether they can last through this period. This is a period where companies who generate cash can last while those who can't will end up downsizing operation > lower growth > lower revenue.\n4. It's important to understand that the market is only a prediction of what people expect the shares would be under great circumstances. Right now, the circumstances are all against stocks and other assets because of how screwed up the economy is. But what matters is the long-term projection of the company. If you hold a strong company, that company will prevail. If you hold a trashy company, such as Bed Bath and Beyond and think they will magically become a behemoth, good luck! Those companies are NOT surviving this. I'll bet you any amount of money. The stock market ain't going away tomorrow! It will recover... as history has shown the past century. It will RECOVER, but it might not be a timeframe that you will like. Some companies will recover faster than the other... it really depends on how nasty this global economy can get. China is a big factor, here. China having a recession is BAD for America because of how much America depends on China. It might be good for foreign affairs but terrible for the economy. \n\nJust stay vigilant. If you need the money, you should probably sell. If you don't have a secure career or steady income, think about starting an emergency fund. But if you decide to hold, in all likelihood, you will look back 20 years from now and see you are up. My investments are all long-term oriented. The financials of these companies are doing great. Do I wish I sold early this year and repurchased at these cheaper prices? HECK YES. But if anyone could have predicted this, they would be the richest person in the world.

Not every sector is experiencing the same bear market...\n\n6. The stock market isn't the only market.  Other markets can be more deserving of \\[insitutional\\] funds depending on the macro environment.  E.g. a bog standard DCF of a company includes 1+interest rate \\*squared\\* as the denominator.   I.e. the higher the base interest rate, the more risk-free return there is elsewhere (e.g. treasury bonds) and the less money it makes sense to allocate to risk-on assets like stocks.

When the currency is strong (more value per unit currency), a company of the same value will be worth fewer units of that currency, this too is inevitable.\n\nI'm grossly oversimplifying ofc.\n\nBut the point is that big/institutional money is deployable in various places and macro conditions mean that equities are not as attractive a place as they were.
