I find this highly unlikely but I like to consider worst cases just for the heck of it.\n\nMore realistically I could see a fall to 3000 but I also put it slightly unrealistic at least till February or March if that and I'm not even sure.\n\nSo I'd say that from here a more realistic drop would be at most maybe 25% which to me isn't a big deal.\n\nI think though there's more reason to believe we will first approach 4200 or 4300 and then maybe we could see a retest of 3500 or whatever.\n\nBut I always like to consider the worst case and to me 50% is really extreme although I'm sure there's some wack jobs that say we'll hit 2000 or lower.\n\nI think with inflation finally coming down and Jeremy Siegel the other day saying \"inflation is done!\" On CNBC that we will have more upward pressure at least through December I think.\n\nAnyways what's your realistic bear case?\n\nMine is 3000 I'm gonna say, but we may never see it imo.\n\nPeace all.
