He wrote: \u201cStudies indicate that from 2008-13 the Fed\u2019s asset purchases and forward guidance about future short rates jointly reduced 10-year Treasury yields by 100 to 200 basis points on impact and that this reduction modestly raised overall prices and real activity.\u201d  \nHowever, Neely said, quantitative tightening \u201cis unlikely to significantly impede economic activity.\u201d  \nHe explained that \u201cmost of the yield reductions from Fed unconventional policies are probably already undone; some will not be reversed (i.e., yield changes from the reintroduction of liquidity in bond markets); and the remaining effects will probably disappear gradually, over the course of many years. As a result, quantitative tightening will probably not affect the economy in any noticeable way.\u201d\n\n[https://www.stlouisfed.org/open-vault/2019/july/what-is-quantitative-tightening](https://www.stlouisfed.org/open-vault/2019/july/what-is-quantitative-tightening)  \n\n\nUltimately, the FED is raising rates with or without QT adding to it.", "score": 21, "replies": [{"body": "They're doing both.
