A drop of 20% or more from a recent high is one technical definition of a bear market.\n\n> SNAP shares slumped 30% in premarket trading Tuesday after the social-media company warned late Monday that it would likely miss quarterly estimates as the economy has \u201cdeteriorated further and faster than anticipated.\u201d\n\n> \u201cThat\u2019s stopped all the \u2018worst is over\u2019 pundits in their tracks. It highlights how fleeting swings in sentiment are now and that investors are running at the first sign of trouble,\u201d said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at OANDA, in a note to clients.\n\n> Other tech companies that rely on advertising as a revenue stream were also getting battered in premarket, with Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. FB, +1.39% down nearly 6%, Pinterest Inc.  PINS, -1.40% tumbling 11%, Google parent Alphabet GOOGL, +2.37% off 3.8% and Twitter Inc.  TWTR, -1.12%  off around 4%.\n\n...\n\n>\u201dThe market continues to turn itself inside out and back to front as it tries to decide if it has priced all of the impending rate hikes, soft landing or recession, inflation or stagflation, China, Ukraine, US summer driving season, supply chains, the list goes on. The result is a day-to-day chop-fest, and it seems clear that volatility is the winner,\u201d said Halley.\n\n> Investors may be looking for more policy clues from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, who is due to give opening remarks at a Native American development conference at 12:20 p.m. Eastern Time. New home sales for April are due at 10 a.m. Eastern.\n\n___________\n\n**WSJ:**\n\n> Investors are confronting a range of signals as they try to map out the trajectory of the U.S. economy. Many have grown worried that the Federal Reserve\u2019s plans for monetary tightening to tamp down inflation could tip the economy into a recession. That has been among the catalysts for the U.S. stock market\u2019s brutal year, which has sent the S&P 500 falling 17% from its January high, based on Monday\u2019s close. \n\n...\n\n> \u201cWe\u2019re going to have this rollercoaster ride for some time, as investors cling onto more optimistic data points and get fresh disappointment when there\u2019s another downbeat reading coming through,\u201d said Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. \u201cWe don\u2019t yet know the full path of interest-rate rises or how resilient consumers will be.\u201d \n\n> Despite Tuesday\u2019s broad premarket technology selloff, there were bright spots in the market. Zoom Video Communications advanced 5.8% before the opening bell after the videoconferencing services company raised its profit outlook. Elsewhere in the market, Best Buy jumped 8.5% after reporting revenue that topped analyst expectations.\n\n________________________\n\nNote: Marketwatch often changes the title of premarket articles after opening bell.
