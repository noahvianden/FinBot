Modern markets evaluate the TAM of these companies and apply a multiplier for likelihood of capitalizing that TAM. (This market concept is nothing new, but explained thoroughly and beautifully in Peter Thiel's Zero to One.)\n\nThe three combined TAM is \"$/mi driven\" for the robotaxi theory, \"$/kwh\" on the energy grid theory, and $ per labour unit on the moonshot AI-Robot theory.

Tesla will not be the only EV so competition is imminent and 2.
