Same goes with the self driving tech and charging tech, which Tesla leads right now, but are being challenged on all sides by significant players.\n\nEach year that passes, Tesla will find in more challenging (ie. expensive) to keep its lead. They're still benefiting from first mover advantage, but in today's tech/economic climate, their lead margin will be very difficult to defend and expand. \n\nNow you've got Elon distracted by Twitter and his other side projects (not to mention SpaceX, which is obviously not a side project).

While this may be true in 10+ years, at the moment, their current business is about cars and should be judged on their car-related revenue. When they start making money from their data, software, androids, solar, battery storage, or whatever, I'll consider it then.\n\nFor now, the shorts are well aware of the current market conditions and will take advantage.

It said that required delaying the merger by three years unless two-thirds of shares not \u201cowned\u201d by him granted approval.\n\n> Morgan Stanley owns about 8.8% of Twitter shares and Dorsey owns 2.4%.\n\n> Musk hopes to complete his $54.20 a share Twitter takeover this year, in one of the world\u2019s largest leveraged buyouts.\n\n> Musk, the world\u2019s richest person, also runs electric car company Tesla and leads The Boring Co and SpaceX.\n\n> Twitter and its board, including Dorsey and CEO Parag Agrawal, were also named as defendants.\n\n> Twitter declined to comment. Lawyers for Musk and the Florida fund did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\n> The lawsuit also seeks to declare that Twitter directors breached their fiduciary duties, and recoup legal fees and costs. It did not make clear how shareholders believed they might be harmed if the merger closed on schedule.\n\n> On Thursday, Musk said he had raised about $7bn, including from investors like the tech tycoon Larry Ellison, the Qatar state investment fund and the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency exchange, to help fund the takeover.\n\n> According to the filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Ellison is putting $1bn into the transaction. The Saudi Arabian investor Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, who had initially opposed the buyout, agreed to roll his $1.9bn stake into the deal, according to the filing.\n\n> The filing also showed that a margin loan taken out by Musk to finance the deal would be reduced from $12.5bn to $6.25bn.\n\n> The financing news came as CNBC reported that Musk will serve as temporary chief executive of the social media platform for a few months once the deal closes.\n\n> Musk had no financing lined up when he announced plans to buy Twitter last month.\n\n> Some of the new investors appear to share interests with Musk, a self-described \u201cfree speech absolutist\u201d who could change how the San Francisco-based company moderates content.\n\n> Florida\u2019s state pension fund also invests in Twitter, and the state\u2019s governor, Ron DeSantis, said this week it could make a $15m to $20m profit if Musk completed his buyout.\n\n> On Friday, the New York Times reported Musk said he would quintuple revenue to $26.4bn by 2028 from its $5bn last year, citing a proposal presented to investors.\n\n> Under Musk, the company would reduce its advertisement from 90% to nearly 45% of the company\u2019s total revenue. Advertising would generate $12bn in revenue and subscriptions nearly $10bn in 2028, according to the document, the publication reported.\n\n> Another objective in the proposal is increasing Twitter followers to 931 million and also hiring more than 3,500 additional employees. Twitter has 229 million daily users worldwide.\n\n> In afternoon trading, Twitter shares were down 60 cents at $49.76.\n\n\nsource: https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/06/florida-pension-fund-lawsuit-elon-musk-twitter", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.25820910930633545}, {"body": "Here we go with the lawsuits.", "score": 40, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.18272310495376587}, {"body": "It\u2019s not going to work for the pension fund, they will lose and quickly.", "score": 29, "replies": [{"body": "Imagine if every push supported by >15% stakeholders meant that the poison pill kicked in.

{"title": "The Market if fine, The Economy is fine. NOTHING TO SEE HERE!!!", "selftext": "The constant reassurances about peak inflation, soft landings and buy-the-dip strategies are getting louder and more desperate as the days go by. Every economic and market development is instantly explained away and rationalized, keeping the narrative on script that things are progressing as planned. Don't worry about the CPI, market volatility or the FEDs balance sheet runoff, you will be told how to interpret these items... Nothing to see here!\n\nBelow is a chart of the S&P 500 vs the FED balance sheet, notice any correlations here?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ulc9llh7q2y81.png?width=770&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a0ee86a28579b83ce9ffa076a5605174cc1585b\n\nAt the most recent meeting, the FED detailed the runoff of their $9 trillion balance sheet, $4.5 trillion of which was added since the pandemic began. Starting June 1, the runoff will be as followed for the next 3 months:\n\nTreasuries: $30 billion per month will fall off the balance sheet\n\nAgency debt and MBS: $17.5 billion will be allowed to mature and not replaced\n\nAt this snails pace, from 6/1 thru 9/1 the balance sheet will drop by $142.5 billion, or 1.6% of total assets. After the initial 3 month period, the runoff will be accelerated to $60 billion for treasuries and $35 billion for agency and MBS debt, taking $1.14 trillion off the books in the following year.\n\nIf you remember the last time the FED attempted quantitative tightening (end of 2018), the market tanked before they abruptly changed course to placate Wall Street. There is a distinct possibility that this could happen again if the market and/or economy force their hand. This runoff is happening in a mid term election year which will likely add uncertainty to the process.\n\nPart of the reason for the sudden change of course last time QT was attempted was a lack of liquidity in the bond markets. It was justified then that the FED was providing necessary liquidity to keep the markets functioning properly. This begs the question this time around: If the FED had to be buyer of last resort when the balance sheet was half the size, who will step in now in this environment? Where are the buyers of these securities? I still haven't seen an answer to this.\n\nIn the current environment of rapidly rising rates, QT and runaway inflation, the stock market is still near all-time historical valuations. Below is the Shiller S&P 500 P/E ratio for the last 100 years:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ebh34p2iv2y81.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6ee5af2649fb343b9750a237c046e616c9044602\n\nEven with the recent pullback placing the Nasdaq in Bear market territory and the S&P 500 firmly in correction mode, we are still well above historic means. Current valuations stand near century highs, rivaled only by 1929 and 2000. The S&P is still a full standard deviation above the historic mean. If the FED sticks to their guns and runs off the balance sheet anywhere near what they project, the downside risk seems to be significantly higher than any upside potential.\n\nAs crazy as the market has been recently, the economy is in no better position. There are the current geopolitical issues with war in Europe and continued lockdowns in China. Interest rates are rising globally, inflation is running unchecked and supply chains show no signs of improving anytime soon. This has caused the FED to update their stance like they did with \"transitory.\"\n\n[https://images.app.goo.gl/Nt2tryGYpu9kxAME8](https://images.app.goo.gl/Nt2tryGYpu9kxAME8)\n\nSeriously though, the economic numbers are all over the place. GDP growth came in at 5.7% for 2021, but has already slowed markedly, decreasing 1.4% in Q12022. Another quarterly decline will put the economy officially into recession territory.\n\nCurrently, CPI is +8.5%, the 10 year treasury has risen above the important 3% level and mortgage rates are above 5.5%. The economy is facing numerous challenges both domestically and globally. The labor market is one of the only bright spots in this current environment, with unemployment coming in at 3.6% and nearly 2 jobs available for every job seeker.\n\nDespite this impressive topline number on unemployment, there are several concerning issues that are getting glossed over. Q1 labor productivity came in a (-) 7.5%, its biggest drop in almost a century. Meanwhile, unit labor costs increased 11.6% in the same time period. Tanking productivity and rampant labor cost increases don't bode well for current and future inflation. Don't worry though, wages, which increased 5.5% year over year are showing signs of slowing, with the monthly increase registering +.3%, well below the yearly gains. Higher prices and lower wages are going to hit an increasingly stretched consumer, which is worrisome as consumer spending makes up 70% of GDP.\n\nAnecdotally, there are signs of slowing across the board. There have been numerous reports of layoffs and hiring freezes recently. Housing is showing minor signs of peaking, with listings staying on the market a little longer than previously and bidding wars seeming to calm down.

Recovery from a pandemic, forever lock downs because China is insane, Russia\u2019s power and the ensuing energy market drama, combined with fed policies being less investor friendly (per se\u2014in the short term) should give anyone pause. However, I think for the non-degenerate investor, betting against the US markets right now seems rough. \n\nFor one, Russia probably saved our oil and gas energy sector, especially LNG as we are possibly set to be one of the biggest exporters to the European market. This means energy jobs, and also gives energy company\u2019s the capital to invest in transition fuels (LNG) and in the longer-term, renewable infrastructure. That\u2019s good for the US economy because jobs and in the long term, as long as oil prices stay elevated, capital will eventually flow into drilling (albeit it\u2019s been slow so far) and that will drive down the price. Peak oil theory is dead, and the price of oil is well above breakevens (even for wildcatters) so I don\u2019t see this being a long term thing. \n\nSecond, the inflation of today is fundamentally different than historical examples as it\u2019s both a result of fed policy and supply chain bottlenecks. We\u2019ve also seen massive wage growth, which makes sense given how bad the average American worker has had it the past 20 or so years. If we weren\u2019t seeing wage growth like we are, then I\u2019d say get your puts on spy ready. Even under a dooms day thesis, production costs will decline as the economy stabilizes post-covid. The problem is the production pivot from China/finding alternative suppliers, which is ongoing and will stabilize eventually. I think this is the most concerning area as China shows an inability to admit the zero covid policy is dumb because of their nationalism/need for the state leadership to be perceived as \u201cgreat leaders.\u201d But on the bright side, crap like this will be China\u2019s downfall to the US because it\u2019s incredibly hard to innovate when your leadership can\u2019t be honest. All the human capital in the world won\u2019t make up for crap leadership that suppresses the population, which will stifle innovation. \n\nThird, US hegemony in the wake of the Russia invasion in Ukraine is arguably restored. The real winner in this all is the US\u2019s resurgence of leadership, as Europe showed, once again, they are largely pussies and need the US to protect the continent. Expect considerable tailwinds for GDP from our defense sector as this will boost exports considerably as Europe now militarizes. \n\nTLDR; I think the long term thesis of the market is still good, short term, it\u2019s likely in part dependent on China as to whether production costs decrease.", "score": 24, "replies": [{"body": "ngl very insightful. but growth is still slower than inflation \ud83d\ude0f and nasdaq bout to dip to ground", "score": -1, "replies": [{"body": "Problem with being a super bear and betting the index \u201cdip to ground\u201d is that ultimately prices will stabilize as the market reaches equilibrium; growth will again outpace inflation.
