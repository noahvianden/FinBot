{"title": "Expected moves. Zoom, Nvidia, Shopify, Alibaba, Costco and more.", "selftext": "### The Broader Markets\n\n**Last Week \u2013** SPY fell 2.8% last week, in line with the 2.7% move options were pricing. The markets rallied to end the week with a roughly 2.5% move higher from the lows of the week. So once again, the range on the week was wide from highs to lows and back.\n\n**This Week \u2013 SPY** options are pricing about a 2.7% move for the upcoming week (about $11 in either direction). That\u2019s the same as last week\u2019s options.\n\n**Implied Volatility / VIX \u2013** The VIX closed the week near 29. Roughly where it was last week.\n\n**Expected Moves for This Week** (via Options AI)\n\n* SPY **2.7%** (+/- $11)\n* QQQ **3.5%** (+/- $10)\n* IWM **3.3%** (+/- $6)\n* DIA **2.4%** (+/- $8)\n\n### In the News\n\nThe broader markets hit an official bear market level this past week, with the majority of that selling happening in April and May. SPY was $462 on March 29th, not far from its all-time highs made in the first week of January. However, under the surface, many of the hot names from the past few years began their sell-off in the Fall of 2021. Perhaps no name better illustrates that than Shopify SHOP which is now down nearly 80% from its highs made in mid-November \u201921. In previous high-flying names, implied volatility of options can compress after the market has seemingly given up on the potential for the stock to make large moves higher. In fact, with SHOP now $364 (down from $1700) options are only pricing a potential move higher by year-end that would take the stock just above $500. (or a move lower to about $200). In other words, the options market is not even close to pricing anything in these stocks that would look like 2020-2021 era again. (or even the March rally that took the stock up above $700).\n\nThat could mean opportunity within options if these stocks ever came back into favor, but for now, the options market is not seeing it. And that also helps partially explain the stubbornness of overall market volatility with a fairly consistent 30-ish VIX over the past few weeks. Options are trying to price a fairly consistent sell-off in the broader market. For IV to spike from here, the market would likely need much wider swings higher and lower where both rallies and declines weren\u2019t being properly priced, or an outsized 1-2 day capitulation sell-off where traders reached for puts out of panic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xhqfwrlbw2191.png?width=569&format=png&auto=webp&s=1059e95fdf6ee680a38a720a444d17e521367d01\n\n## Earnings\n\n*Links* below go to the Options AI calendar where you can see the other companies each day and click through to see charts (free to use).

{"title": "Volatility and You: How Underhedging Creates Crashes", "selftext": "**TL;DR**: The market is, in general, underhedged. Lack of hedging with put options is creating a scenario that makes our ability to rally upward much harder and increases crash risk. Buy short-dated ATM straddles (more risky), buy puts, directly short the S&P 500 (less risky), or stay in cash (not really risky at all) (see \"How to position yourself\").\n\n---\n\n> *SINK RATE! SINK RATE!*\n\n\\- Boeing 787 MAX TAWS, being piloted by Captain Powell\n\n---\n\nLet's talk about options! The S&P 500 (SPX) has the most liquid options market in probably the world. Now sometimes people, instead of using these derivatives for gambling based on what side of a yard a dog poops on, use them to hedge their exposures to stocks and the market. \n\nThey are bought and sold by market makers (Citadel's the king, obviously, but there are others). People (in general) buy put options and sell call options. Sometimes though, there are speculators who would buy call options and sell put options (think WSB, thetagang, your grandfather's pension, etc).\n\nMarket makers want to do one thing: capture the spread between the bid and the ask price. They don't care about short ladders or whatever. They'll happily be long or short SPX, GME^[1], TSLA, whatever if it makes them more money.\n\nIn order to hedge their exposure to the movement of stock price action (gamma), volatility (vanna), and time (charm), they buy and sell /ES (S&P futures) to hedge to their delta^[2].\n\nIf dealers are negatively exposed to *gamma*, things get a bit volatile but if dealers get negatively exposed to *vanna*, things get real volatile real fast because they are selling into selling (which increases implied volatility, leading to more required delta hedging) and buying into buying (which decreases implied volatility, leading to more required delta hedging) in order to hedge.\n\nTo explain with a simple analogy: that crazy ex, she's vanna. Vanna will take you to your highest highs but will also take you to your lowest lows. And... yeah those lows will be low. And no, I'm not going to help you \"get over\" her. And by the way, my bf is coming over for the week so we'll need the house.\n\nBack to options.\n\nIt's worth noting that dealers quote their options in *volatility* terms, not dollars and cents^[3]. But implied volatility is relatively low for a 1000 point drop right now and [*isn't increasing as we drop*](https://i.imgur.com/ct8TGaJ.png).\n\nThis is because there are a lot of people systematically selling puts, driving down IV. And because IV is being driven down by the put sellers, bulls can't get a sustained bear market rally (since these rallies are often fueled by rehedging)\n\nBut it's pretty obvious to anyone who's traded that realized volatility has far outstripped implied volatility (especially on the \"FDs\") and that FDs are relatively cheap. VIX is 29 right now, which implies about a 2%ish (off the top of my head) move each day. We're getting multi percent intraday moves, even if close-to-close we're going relatively slow. *This is absurd.*\n\nI could go on but you get the point already so let's move on.\n\n# How to position yourself\n\nSo... there are a couple ways you can play this relatively historic event depending on your risk tolerance (from most risky to least risky)\n\n1. **Buy straddles extremely close to expiration, especially on days with large intraday moves.** Because IV is chronically underpriced here, you should be able to make money buying 0 DTE straddles. Don't use Robinhood or anything like that, they'll screw you over by market selling your position early. Also don't do it systematically, because you will lose out when you don't get the move you want.\n2. **Buy somewhat longer term put options.** SPX 6/21 3800p (SPY 6/21 380p) is probably a decent option and has a decent chance of going ITM. You can sell on a volatility spike or keep them going into expiration.\n3. **Keep hitting those tails.** 3\u03c3 30 DTE SPY put options (it's currently SPY 6/21 305p) are only 13bps ($0.50). On a massive move, those tails will explode in value. You're not going for them going ITM, you're going for P/L so you can unload your bags onto Citadel. Buy them when VIX is in the 20s.\n4. **Short E-Mini S&P 500 futures (/ES or /MES) or SPY or something.** This will be probably the least gut wrenching thing to do. You'll make a lot of money, but you probably won't get a heart attack in 20 years from the stress of watching options change rapidly in value. So... it has its downsides. Wait for a large volatility blow up (look at VIX) or for Fed to reverse course to unload your position.\n5. **Go cashgang.** Sure you'll miss out on gains, but you'll only decay at 8%/year vs. the 30%+ drop (+ decaying at 8%/year). You can [place $10k into I-bonds](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ibonds/res_ibonds.htm) if you're worried about inflation at an interest rate of 9.62% *risk-free*.\n\n(My positions are #4 and a bit of #3 opportunistically.)\n\nGood luck WSB, you're gonna need it.\n\n# Some anticipated criticism\n**But volatility is heteroskedastic!**\n\nYour criticism here is basically that IV doesn't move 1-to-1 with SPX and while that's true, realized volatility is still above implied volatility (VIX should be like in the 40s). But implied volatility is still implying that there isn't hedging and a deeper analysis reveals that in general, there are a lot of put sellers.\n\nThere's also a pretty well established inverse correlation in SPX with IV in general (although don't naively apply this to single stocks, especially ones like GME). \n\n**But volatility should be low for a sustained drop!**\n\nSure but volatility isn't constant and is based on a few things including how \"\"\"fearful\"\"\" the market is. And even so, even if we sustained a constant move down every single day (which we don't) you'd still have gamma P/L to contend with. This alone makes it so that volatility is 0 or whatever but it's also dependent on other factors here. What I'm contending here is that these factors are such that volatility is massive underpriced, especially with the massive intraday moves that we are seeing.\n\n**VIX is a bad volatility index!**\n\nYeah I know but I used it for simplicity. Anyone in the vol space knows that SPX vol and skew (not the SKEW index!) isn't being bid up all that much relatively so... yeah.\n\n# Footnotes\n1. Stocks like GME and AMC which have relatively predictable behavior (i.e. lots of people buying call options to force rallies and rehedging) are very profitable for market makers like Citadel because they are able to collect very wide spreads on the options. MMs got caught offsides a bit by the January 2021 event (basically the options chain acted as if every option was 50\u0394) and the gamma profile was very negative then, as anyone who works on a desk will tell you (this is what the SEC got wrong in their report). It's an interesting happening, but it's a story for another time.\n\n2. Plus some to account for skew. Also, it's worth noting that delta-hedging exists independent of BSM. You still have to hedge for price movements, volatility, and time even if you aren't pricing your options using BSM, which practitioners don't.\n\n3. Remember that everything except for volatility and rates are known observables so these are the only two things that can really be \"priced\" per se. Something like BSM can be used to map IVs to dollars and cents.\n\n[1]: #footnotes \"Stocks like GME and AMC which have relatively predictable behavior (i.e. lots of people buying call options to force rallies and rehedging) are very profitable for market makers like Citadel because they are able to collect very wide spreads on the options.

These hedges combined with not much participation on the share side(ie sellers are done selling/have no need to sell as they're hedged, but buyers aren't buying yet) are dragging prices down as dealers hedge these hedges fueling something of a gamma squeeze to the downside with no BTDers as backstop. Also, this is why we aren't getting higher highs on VIX while we make lower lows.\n\nThe long hedge puts are being rolled down as we get closer to expiry and closer to ITM to lower and lower strikes. 400Ps had the biggest OI and the first time we dipped below 400, they were mostly rolled down into the 390 380 strikes and 390 had the biggest OI. On Friday, as soon as those 390Ps went ITM, we started flushing down to the low 380s until we started getting close enough to market close that dealers started feeling comfortable closing their short hedges. \n\nThis seems like the dynamic that we've been in for the past few months and we have another huge put OI for the June monthly. As such I don't expect this dynamic to change until flows change in a meaningful way ie people stop rolling down their put hedges, and/or we get some crazy buying pressure. Downside risk is some kind of event that causes a sharp drawdown that's currently not hedged for. This will cause an actual VIX spike and possibly the capitulation that everyone is talking about.\n\nEdit: I would like to add that this would be the opposite of what we saw in later half of 2020 and 2021 where big call buying was dragging the market up along with the passive autobuy funds and short covering.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Kevin O'Leary said he is waiting on one 'big fish' who leveraged wrong and made a bad bet, to go tits up and that it will sink the market 25% or more and it will rattle the world.

Also SPX includes some financials, which NDX doesn't.", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.38405588269233704}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3914271295070648}, {"body": "Well written my friend.

That's a LOT OF FRICKIN MONEY AT ONCE which means it was someone who intentionally both SOLD AND BOUGHT on the lit exchange, or several people who sold, and one who bought to hit closer to max pain and make money. But if they stuck cash in to hit max pain for those options tendies, then come monday they have to sell off all that cash they pumped in to hit max pain BEFORE everyone else sells. Otherwise they could be bag holding. I have 5/27 puts with an break even of 376 and I fully believe that Monday those people who bought last second on Friday will unwind Monday am and if that coincides with Monkeyballs or whatever that new thing is causing people to sell, we could definitely drop well below 380 this week. 383 was the 20% recession mark, and we hit it and passed it. So I think we will drop $15 at some point this week but we will have one green day, like EOD Monday or Tuesday but we will be incredibly volatile especially after that shit we saw at 3pm on Friday. MSM is reinforcing the crash too, indicating that at some point panic will set in. It's a question of when at this point.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["recession", "crash"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["inflation", "crash", "tsla", "vix", "ba"]}
