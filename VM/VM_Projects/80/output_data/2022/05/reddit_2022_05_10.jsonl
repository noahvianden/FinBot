They don't look at hiring decisions, revenue growth, cash-to-debt ratios, the C-suite, or investments made in the interest of long term growth. They see the line go down, and then say, \"look at the business failing!\"\n\nThe fucking S&P is down 20% this year, you dummy. You can't look at a company's stock chart during a crash and draw conclusions about their success in the long-term. Well, you can, but you'd be a huge retard.\n\nBuying BBBY at $15 is a good buy. The company is undeniably undervalued. Buying it *now,* at $10, is a better buy, but that doesn't make someone stupid to have bought at $15. It just means they got unlucky with their entry. And that's exactly the point. You can't avoid the randomness involved with short term price action in the stock market.
