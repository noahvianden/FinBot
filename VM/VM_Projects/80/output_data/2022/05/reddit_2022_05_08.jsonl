{"title": "Expected moves. Amazon, Disney, Coinbase, Palantir, Peloton and more.", "selftext": "## The Broader Markets\n\n**Last Week \u2013** SPY was lower by just 0.4% last week, less than the 3.1% move options were pricing. The markets however were quite volatile day to day with large swings higher and lower of more than 5% intra-week. Implied volatility was lower on the week.\n\n**This Week \u2013 SPY** options are pricing about a 2.8% move for the upcoming week (about $12 in either direction).\n\n**Implied Volatility / VIX \u2013** The VIX closed the week near 30, down from 33 to start the week and lower than the 36+ intra-week.\n\n**Expected Moves for This Week** (via Options AI)\n\n* SPY **2.8%** (+/- $12)\n* QQQ **3.7%** (+/- $12)\n* IWM **3.4%** (+/- $6)\n* DIA **2.4%** (+/- $8)\n\n## In the News\n\nAmazon (AMZN) and Alphabet are set for 20-1 stock splits in the beginning of June, less than a month from now. With both stocks currently near $2300, that would mean a roughly $115 price for each post-split. A recent CBOE study showed that large-cap stocks tend to see initially increased (split-adjusted) volume, volatility, and implied volatility but that effect tapers off over time. Pre split options in AMZN are currently pricing in about a 10% move for the June 10th expiry. That aligns with a post-split levels of about $103 on the downside and about $126 on the upside. Here\u2019s how that expected move looks pre-split:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/118aotth2ay81.png?width=568&format=png&auto=webp&s=14408c8a7b4f21ecb4e005f340624eb90b1b66ba\n\nAlphabet options are pricing slightly less of a move to 6/10 expiry, around 8%.\n\n## Earnings\n\n*Links* below go to the Options AI calendar where you can see the other companies each day and click through to see charts (free to use).
