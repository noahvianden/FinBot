The company ended 2021 with more than $18 billion. The company with the next-best balance is Lucid, with more than $5 billion.*\n\n**TLDR** The weak market is responsible for part of Monday\u2019 reaction, but investors are abandoning more speculative start-up stocks for other reasons\u2014and the EV companies are in a particularly tight spot.\n\nInvestors might be forgetting or simply dismissing just how much cash Rivian has. Rivian\u2019s enterprise value, which is essentially market capitalization less net cash, is down to about $6 billion. Lucid\u2019s enterprise value is about 25 billion. Both companies have plants and are shipping EVs. The disparity is a little jarring.\n\nAll the declines reflect a lot of things, including more competition from traditional players such as Ford Motor (F) and General Motors (GM) as well as dwindling cash balances.\n\nInvestors no longer seem to believe that all the EV start-ups that popped onto the scene in the past few years can be long-term winners anymore.\n\nAt their peaks, the dozen EV start-ups had a combined market capitalization of more than $430 billion. Now the combined cap sits at $85 billion, down 80%.\n\nShares of a dozen EV start-ups that Barron\u2019s tracks are trading at or near 52-week lows.
