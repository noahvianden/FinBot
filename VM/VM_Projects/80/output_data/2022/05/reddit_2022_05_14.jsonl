While you and /brandnew are correct in pointing out that every transaction has a buyer and seller, OP is asking about the meaning of volume and what it can tell us in conjunction with price movement, and for that you have to look at market context.\n\nIf a candle has low volume and moves strongly in a direction, say up and after a pullback, we can infer there are few to none hitting the bid, and most transactions have hit the ask in an effort to continue the trend. There is little countermove resistance. If another candle has high volume but moves relatively little from an open, say a day or two after a breakout, we can infer that price is in high contention and either hitting a huge S/R or has found an area of fair value where many traders are looking to participate. The volume gives you a sense of participation, but you have to put that volume in context, say in an uptrend into resistance or in a range at a volume node. Volume and market context tell you everything you need.\n\nVolume spread analysis is probably the most legitimate TA tool that retail doesn't know about,  and can be that missing piece of the puzzle for setup traders.  \n\n\nAlso, volume can certainly move price outside of taking liquidity, if not directly.

Here's a list of some rules I've observed over the years watching the never-ending shit show that is the financial markets.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMega Trader Rules:\n\nRule #1\n\nWhen you want to buy a large holding, tell everyone they should sell.\n\nRule #2\n\nWhen you want to hold a large holding, tell everyone they should hold.\n\nRule #3\n\nWhen you want to sell a large holding, tell everyone they should buy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEmotional Rules:\n\nRule #4\n\nIgnore your emotions and make logic-based trading decisions.\n\nRule #5\n\nReduce all information into binary format. ie: candle is either up or down, news is either good or bad, stock is either buy or don't buy, sell or don't sell.\n\nRule #6\n\nIdentify a profitable logic-based system, then back-test it until you become bored with the paper profits before risking capital. Then, risk small amounts of capital until you become bored with small profits before risking larger amounts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPersonal Rules:\n\nRule #7\n\nKnow your own strengths and weaknesses, to know your ideal timeframe, trading frequency, method complexity, etc...\n\nRule #8\n\nUnderstand your personal risk tolerance, to avoid over-trading, over-leverage, etc...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEgo Rules:\n\nRule #9\n\nSee yourself as ignorant at all times, and try to educate yourself as well as possible.\n\nRule #10\n\nSee others as knowing vital information that you are missing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPsychology Rules:\n\nRule #11\n\nSpend some time every day de-traumatizing your mind and body from the negative emotions trading gives you.\n\nRule #12\n\nAccurately control your thoughts so you can accurately control your trading actions.\n\nRule #13\n\nSet achievable goals that don't involve making money and let money flow into and out of your account as you trade towards them.\n\nRule #14\n\nNever spend money in your mind if you are currently unable to spend it in reality.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSocial Rules:\n\nRule #15\n\nDon't brag to non-traders/investors when you make large gains.\n\nRule #16\n\nDon't cry to non-traders/investors when you suffer large losses.\n\nRule #17\n\nDon't talk to non-traders/investors about market-related topics they have no interest in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSelf-Limiting, Self-Supporting Rules:\n\nRule #18\n\nSet your self-limiting beliefs at a comfortable level above where you currently are in reality, so you can easily grow towards them without too much fear of change.\n\nRule #19\n\nSet your self-supporting beliefs exactly where you currently are in reality, so you can work towards holding your ground during setbacks.\n\nRule #20\n\nKnow exactly where you 'need' to be going in life right now, so you can accurately adjust your limiting and supporting beliefs to keep your efforts focused in the right direction.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDiscipline Rules:\n\nRule #21\n\nTrading is financial warfare!

You said lost at rules. I commented that you should have some rules and then have just a basic idea of trading with rules. What I shared is also for others to read. Op shared a really good post. You replied vary nonchalant . My next comment was just that if you don\u2019t think percentage risk matters it will once you calculate true trading cost and how much it cost to loose consistently. This sub has a lot of proud losers so it\u2019s no boast to brag you never lose at market open. I definitely have and my entire account many times at seconds of opening trades. But I didn\u2019t make any assumptions to you as a individual I just continued in spirit of op to give some two cents as it pertained to your comment about rules so others who may find what I said worth taking note too. This is a lonely game. Another one of ops rule is that someone else has keys your missing. So that\u2019s a great ponder in its self as well. But to share this quickly. I stopped trading options almost entirely now for 2 years and trade forex. I study charts and trade probably more often then majority of traders here since if you trading lower then 25k you when to respect pdt. Those trading larger accounts still do not usually place near the amount of trades a forex scalper does. Generally speaking it is the most liquid market and tradable 247 with binary options even. So I have a small amount of experience to shed light on. In forex percentage risk is so important and entirely a game changer. Because it\u2019s leverage trading and far greater then robinhood since options is a set risk. I\u2019ve become a mad man to evaluate percentage risk as I trade prop firms. For the records and you don\u2019t have to take my words for this but my chart skills have gotten very good because of all the hours I\u2019ve put in. But I will stay say I lose and why it\u2019s important to pass on what we and what I learn about how to protect and preserve capital. There is a ton of depression that goes along with this lonely game. Where no one understands why your loosing or why your not winning and why you keep having to reload the tokens. Non of this is really directed to you but I guess for the rookies then. But op sounds like they have traded also some forex.

Only if it's consequential can the next question be asked, as per the rules of regular logic.\n\nIf there's three options at the first question then there's the potential for the second round of questions to have nine options or more.

Sometimes you didn't have all the information when you initially formed it. Sometimes the overall situation will change. Sometimes you will just have been flat out wrong.\n\n5 - When you realize what you're holding isn't actually worth its price, sell it. Don't rely on hope/greed that it could be more expensive tomorrow. Your profit/loss in the trade should not be a consideration. \n\n5a - The only semi-exception is taxes/min length of holding requirements. This is actually the sort of thing options are supposed to be used for - you can use them to protect yourself while waiting a bit longer for long-term gains tax rates to kick in.\n\n6 - Options buyers typically lose money. That's OK if they're being used as insurance to protect a much larger amount of money. Otherwise it's better to be a seller of options rather than a buyer.\n\n7 - When you fail to follow your rules, but make money on the trade anyway, it's still bad. When you follow your rules and lose money, you still did the right thing.
