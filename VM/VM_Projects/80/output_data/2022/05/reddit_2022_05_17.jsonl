I kept my distance. I\u2019m healthy, but in my 40s, and wanted to see if we\u2019d have a spike. Nothing seemed to happen, and I cautiously started going out, being careful. By October of 2020, you\u2019d still see people wearing masks in supermarkets, but night clubs and concerts were packed \u2014 moreso than before because of all the people from other places. Halloween was a crazy blowout of parties and people all out with the weather being nice \u2014 it might as well have been an end of a war celebration. \n\nI know one older guy that died from Covid who was super sick and refused to get help, a younger person who is still dealing with the effects of it, but said he got it in 2019 and was hospitalized before anyone knew about it. He tested positive for antibodies in 2020. And one other older person who was hospitalized for a month because he went into the hospital twice, feeling like crap, and they didn\u2019t treat him because the tests returned false negatives. \n\nLooking back, Florida handled it far better than the rest of the country. I believe the incentives for Covid deaths encouraged classification and even killing people in other states. We\u2019ve known that Covid is not particularly bad for young and healthy people, and the correct course of action was to caution people and have at-risk groups self isolate. It\u2019s apparent to me that effects of the handling of Covid have been worse than the sickness itself. A lot of relationships between productive people were ruined, there have been suicides, drug addictions and overdoses, and a number of people have ended up in worse health or dead because of discontinued or fear of seeking medical treatment for other issues. \n\nA couple final thoughts: The first being that, anyone who has been to China will know that the Chinese do not have a concept of personal space like we do here in the west. They yell, cough and sneeze in each other\u2019s faces at distances that we could consider intimate. Viral load is known to be an issue and six feet of social distancing is almost normal here and in Europe. Also, growing up in the 80s and 90s, we all thought we were gonna die from AIDS if we had unprotected sex, or even if a condom broke or something. As it turns out, the risk for straight people who didn\u2019t share needles or take it up the ass was pretty low.
