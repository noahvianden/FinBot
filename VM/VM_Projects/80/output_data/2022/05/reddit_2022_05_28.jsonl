The following explanation might be a bit complex for the average trader but I\u2019m happy to elaborate\u2026 It\u2019s actually the build up of Vol hedges (long puts) that the masses buy as protection that begins to act as support, complacency is what will eventually lead to a crash. Let me explain\u2026as of late we have seen these hedges built up indicated by low skew and high put to call ratios. As these hedges become the crowded trade it begins to suppress implied volatility (iv) in relation to realized volatility (rv). In fact, in the last two weeks we had several days where VIX was down and the market was down, not a typical occurrence. As these hedges (long puts) underperformed in relation to rv, traders who relied on them to protect their longs began to abandoned them. If you are familiar with dealer flow this means that dealers who initially sold those puts to traders and shorted underlying stock to create a delta neutral position, now need to buyback that underlying stock as traders abandon their hedges\u2026 Furthermore, dealers need to buyback underlying stock as the hedges experience time decay (charm) and as ivol decreases (vanna). These three components are what provided a base via dealer buybacks and ignited the rally we now have, and actually starts a positive feedback loop. As we now rally, traders that had tried to hedge and got burned by underperforming puts, now look towards other ways to protect their longs: selling longs, buying shorts, etc.  As this rally heads higher complacency will set in and traders will continue to not trust the performance of puts relative to realized volatility. This leaves the market unhedged, and an unhedged market is a market without support. Eventually when the market begins to sell off from this rally and all this volatility supply will be burned up, there will not be enough puts to decay to provide supportive buyback from dealers, this where you can see a violent move down (unlike the slow burn we\u2019ve seen this year). This lack of trust in IV performing in the future is ironically what will lead to a crash and IV exploding as we saw in volmagaden in 2017.

A dealer will sell that person the put and now the dealer has a short-put position (dealer bull position) to delta hedge that position (make it neutral) they will then short an equivalent value of underlying futures or stock(dealer bear position) . The put they sold can gain or lose value on three different things: \n1.\tCharm-the change in time to expiration\n2.\tVanna-the change due to implied volatility movement \n3.\tOr simply the person getting rid of their put.\n\nAs the value of the put they sold to open moves around, in order for the dealer to stay delta-neutral, they must buy or sell more of those underlying futures against it. Certain times of the month have a lessor or greater affect on these flows. For example, going into and out of monthly options expiration. It\u2019s no coincidence that this rally started after last Friday\u2019s monthly options expiration.\n\nI used to scoff at people who said they could predict the market.
