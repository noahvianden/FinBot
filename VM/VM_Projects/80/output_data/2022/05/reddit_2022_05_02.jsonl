For example, do you mean a sudden drop in the S&P500? The tricky bit is you dont know if the market will drop even lower. Right now we're pretty much back to where we were a year ago. Is this the bottom? Or can the market fall even lower?\n\nWe've been in a bull market for ages. A bear market that may continue on for some time can mean the stocks you buy now may go even lower. And, when the trend reverses back to a bull market, the new market leaders may not be the same stocks that led the way in the previous bull market. So it's risky.\n\nRemember, while the general idea is to \"buy low, sell high\" it's hard to know if the current price is low or high until some time has passed. A $10 share price for a stock that traded at $100 a month ago might seem low but if it goes to $1 in a month, buying at $10 would be buying high.\n\nThat's why another saying is \"buy into strength, sell into weakness\". If a stock is in an upward trend, it seems likely that the current price, even if it seems high, would actually be a low price relative to the future.\n\nA $1 stock that goes to $10 in a nice, even slope, can go up to $20, $50, $100, a $1000. Who knows? So while $10 may seem high compared to $1, it may actually seem low in the future. And if the trend reverses and starts going down fast (weakness), you can always cut your losses early and sell. If it reverses again and starts going up (strength) you can always buy back in.\n\nSince the overall market currently seems weak, it doesn't make much sense to buy it. The only exception would be when everyone is so exhausted and bearish that all the sellers have already sold their positions. At that point, selling pressure drops to a minimum and you start seeing a slow but steady rise in buying. That's a sign of a trend reversal. If you want to take the risk, you can get in then or wait for confirmation (more strength).", "score": 21, "replies": [], "tickers": ["crash"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Bc if you buy cheap stock after a dip, it\u2019s harder to show your loss porn.", "score": 14, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1531805396080017}, {"body": "If you actually want to make money in the market, set aside a small amount each month, and buy VOO every month, regardless of the price.

So the things I think I understood are: A crash goes a long time, the chances of a stock falling more over the years are high.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Here is a non-joking answer.  You never know when it hits bottom, so investing on the way down, short term, will look like a lot of loss.  Take Random Stock A for example, normally sells around $100 a share.  It plummets to $50, so you grab 1000 shares for $50k.  It keeps going down to $10, so now you only have $10k, a loss of $40k.\n\nBut!  If you do not sell at $10, and the company survives the crash, it could go back up well beyond where it was.  There are two hard parts in this.  First is picking a company that will survive the crash,  and even as they crash this stock is typically expensive.  This isn't the time to invest in a company you have never heard of, it's the time to invest in a company that is going to still be here long after we all die.  The second part is ignoring that money until the crash is over and it becomes profitable.  The above example is only a loss of $40k if you sell at $10, if you wait for it to turn profitable, you didn't lose anything.  \n\nCrashes happen because a little dip upsets enough people that they leave the market, causing a big dip, scaring more people, amplifying the dip in a vicious cycle.  If you have the confidence to invest and not panic sell when the stock goes down, in the long term you will make money.\n\nThe reason you are getting a lot of joke responses is because most people in wsb (at least the ones who talk) aren't playing long games, they want to make lots of money fast, so they play a lot of short games.  Instead of trying to 200% their money with a solid investment with lots of research and due diligence (DD if you see that posted), they are investing in things that, short term, should see an increase, then pulling it out and investing again.  Both ways have their merits.  Both ways require a certain mindset.  Find out which mindset you are, and then stay the hell away from the other kind, because you just get piles of crap with very little usable info.\n\nI hope this helps.
