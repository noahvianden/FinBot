According to the site below the difference is there yet not that important (2.31 l/km vs 2.39l/km works out as an 3.34% advantage - and it was a pretty extreme scenario where the differences matter most).\n\nhttps://simpleflying.com/high-density-low-cost-long-haul/\n\nSo\u2026 some metrics?

So far around 1500 have been ordered with about 1000 A350s ordered. \n\nI don\u2019t think the A350 will sell as much as the 787 overall. That is - in my opinion - mostly due to the fact that Boeing was a lot earlier on the market with it and a lot of airlines thus chose it. The problems in the beginning and the problems now might hurt it but that won\u2019t be enough.\n\nThe only scenario which might give the 350 a chance to beat the 787 would be if the 777x encountered such massive problems that customers would switch from it to the 350. possible in the state Boeing is in right now but I can hardly believe it.\n\nThe A350 freighter might be a success but historically Boeing had an edge in the freighter conversions.\n\nBut what\u2019s more concerning for Boeing is that the A330neo recently was selling a bit better than the 787. Since both have about the same cost per seat (capital costs included the 330-900neo wins by a slight margin with it otherwise being the other way round by a slight margin - bot at full load and the typical Lay-out for a transatlantic flight).\n\nSo the undisputed success of the 787 is successfully challenged by Airbus from both sides (costwise the A330neo and in other things from the A350).\n\nBoeing has to count on the 777x to turn things around or it will be outsold heavily in the widebody sector.\n\nAnd that\u2019s leaving aside the A321neos long range version - which as much as I regret it might well be the most promising model for mid- to longrange budget flight.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["ba"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["ba"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "It looks like you shared an AMP link.
