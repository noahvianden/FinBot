{"title": "Cherish every opportunity of the US stock technology sector plummeting", "selftext": "Since the beginning of the year, the cumulative decline of the major US stock indexes has reached between 15% and 20%, which is basically in line with the characteristics of a bear market. Judging from the characteristics of the two bear markets of US stocks in 1930 and 2000, the market has first adjusted the valuation and then adjusted the EPS. Growth stocks fall first, followed by value stocks. Considering the many potential risks in the short term, the view that some so-called markets have bottomed out is still very debatable. At present, the market's expectation of the Fed's interest rate hike has been relatively fully taken into account. We believe that the core variable affecting the follow-up stock price trend is no longer the interest rate, but the judgment on the economic outlook and corporate profit expectations. Regarding the short-term macro trend, the market is extremely worried and full of divergences, and we are unable to judge. At the same time, the market's 2022 earnings expectations for the core index of the US stock technology sector and representative stocks have not been significantly revised down, which shows that the market is still more at the wait-and-see level in the short term. Of course, this also means that if the follow-up macro economy exceeds expectations Downward, the downward revision of sector & individual stock earnings expectations will be a risk that needs to be vigilant.\n\nIn the short term, it is expected to continue to fluctuate, and EPS will become the focus of follow-up.

The problem is that only one of the conditions for a rally is in place, that everyone\u2019s scared. That worked beautifully for timing the start of the 2020 rebound, but this time around may not be enough.  \nThe other requirements are that investors start to see a way through the challenges, and that policy makers start to help. Without those, the risk is a series of bear-market rallies that don\u2019t last, hurting dip buyers and further damaging investor confidence.  \nThis time central bankers are scared not by falling markets or the economic outlook, but by inflation. Sure, if something major breaks in the financial system, they will refocus on finance, and a recession may prompt them to rethink rate rises. But for now, inflation means that falling stock prices are seen merely as a side effect of tighter monetary policy, not a reason to invoke the \u201cFed put\u201d and rescue investors.  \nThere is nothing magical about a fall of 20%, the usual definition of a bear market. But it does crop up a lot: In the past 40 years, the S&P 500 has bottomed out with a 20%-or-so peak-to-trough decline four times, in 1990, 1998, 2011 and 2018. Another four times it had far bigger losses, as true panic took hold.  \nThe common factor in the 20% drops was the Federal Reserve. Each time, the market bottomed out when the central bank eased monetary policy, with the stock market\u2019s fall perhaps helping push the Fed to take the threats more seriously then it otherwise might.  \nMy concern is that this time could be more like 1973-1974. Just as then, the primary concern of the country is inflation, thanks to a war-related oil-price shock. Just as then, the inflationary shock took hold when the Fed had rates far too low given the scale of political stimulus for the economy. Just as then, favored stocks\u2014the Nifty Fifty, now the FANGS and associated acronyms\u2014had soared in prior years.  \nMost important, in 1974 the Fed kept raising rates even as a recession took hold because it was running to catch up with inflation. The result was a horrible bear market interspersed with soul-destroying temporary rallies, two of 10%, two of 8% and two of 7%, each snuffed out. It took 20 months before the low was reached\u2014not coincidentally, when the Fed finally began to get serious about cutting rates.  \nTo be clear, this article is not predicting a bear market, just saying that conditions are almost optimal for one to occur.
