Musk is pretty candid about making mistakes and how every design has problems, you just try to minimize problems. So it's not like he's a genius that's pumping out perfect designs for everything he works on.\n\nIt's probably more that he can look at engineering in a lot of different fields and understand it enough to be useful. Which is a great skill for hiring and managing engineers because you can see through the B's if you actually understand what they're working on.\n\nBut I think Musk's most important skill is probably that he doesn't trust experts. I remember some interview asked him about the Model 3 ramp, and why they tried so much automation when all the experts had said it wouldn't work. And Musk said that they'd been told so much stuff was impossible by experts, and then they went on and did it anyways, that they can't trust experts.

If you read the book, it'll make you angry and probably not want to fly in a Boeing plane anytime soon.  \nSo I just watched the movie and here are my thoughts;  \n1) I watched the Blackfish documentary back in 2013 and actually placed some puts on SeaWorld that turned out to be very profitable.  \n2) The situation with SeaWorld was very different though for several reasons; hurricanes affected the 2013 tourist season, people actually care about animals more than other people, and the company had a lot of debt from a previous LBO, prior to the IPO.  \n3) Boeing is THE only commercial airline producer in the U.S., and they are in a duopoly for military contracts with Lockheed. They will continue to make billions of dollars of revenue.  \n4) The Netflix documentary does a pretty good job of telling most of the details and providing a dramatic experience for the viewer. However, I actually read the Downfall book and the book obviously provides a lot more details and context, especially on how deregulation over the past three decades has made the FAA subservient to Boeing. After reading the book and watching the documentary, I wish Netflix would've have produced a multi-episode series in the Making a Murderer style, because the Boeing company became a company that murdered people over a span of two-plus decades.  \n5) Boeing probably faces more headwinds than tailwinds in the commercial space;   \n\\- As the documentary shows, Boeing was successful selling the 737 Max 8 through the 2000-teen's, but Boeing has been losing marketshare to Airbus for some time. One of the funny insights from the book is how Boeing played a Game of Thrones strategy on the old Bombardier company to negotiate them down in price to purchase the company. Rather than take the lowball offer, Bombardier sold itself to Airbus.  \n\\- The book also provides details of how Boeing's net revenue went into dividends and stock buybacks rather than R & D for new airplanes. As the documentary points out the Boeing 737 Max 8 is just modified version of a plane originally designed in the late 60's. [Airbus has been outspending Boeing on R & D for years](https://www.aerospace-technology.com/features/airbus-vs-boeing/).  \n\\- Rather than be an engineering company, the Boeing company is now a lobby and financial business. If they can be successful in lobbying the U.S. to put tariffs on Airbus planes than that will help them in U.S. market.   \n\\- I don't know anything about their military defense contracts, other than SpaceX is starting to compete more for those as well. It would be interesting to hear someone from that industry provide information as well.  \n\\- The biggest headwinds are going to be the global economy IMO. The airline industry will probably get a bump this year from tourism, but the airline industry will be hurting long term because of the decrease in business travel.   \n\n\nBoeing is forecasting tremendous revenue growth for the next several years. If they hit their numbers, the stock will shoot back up quickly. The FAA has shown that it can be manipulated w/ \"Jedi-mind tricks,\" so I don't see BA changing it's focus on maximizing shareholder value that started with the ShareValue Trust program back in 1996. Lastly, the new CEO is just another GE/Jack Welch zealot who will run Boeing the same way Jim Condit, Stonecipher (another bag of trash), McNerney (looks of Don Draper, but bag of trash), and recently fired Muilenburg (fake Boy Scout, but ultimately bag of trash).", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "Hey, thank you for helping me learn so much in a single post.
