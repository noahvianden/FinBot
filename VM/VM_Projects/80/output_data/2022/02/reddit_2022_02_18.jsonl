{"title": "$F - Ford Changing The Direction - The EV Space Leader", "selftext": "I was looking at an **Historical Powerhouse FORD**, yes **Ford in my EV - Space DD**.... when you really think about it - Elon did a Great Job with introducing the technology in a Fossil Fuel society, and HIS success and timing has Placed him in The Number#1 Position and the **BIG 3 Traditional BOYS like $F/Ford**... could have done this same THING 25 Years Ago... They decided Not To ...... \n\nMy thinking is because of their relations with Big OIL...... Think On this, $F/Ford making the transition from Gas to Electric for a Powerhouse Like FORD.... How hard Really is it and will their Best Selling Vehicle the F-150 remain in the position of **#1 as an Electric Vehicle?????** I Think So\n\n**Key Indicators** that Ford is about to become the best EV company on the Market...  Ford plans to **increase its production capacity of electric vehicles to 600,000 units globally by 2023**, according to CEO Jim Farley. The executive expects that would make the company the second-largest U.S.-based producer of EVs, behind Tesla.  \n\n**Another Key Indicator** that FORD will Once again be #1 is that development plans have progressed since the partnership was announced. Ford Motor and **Rivian** have dropped plans to develop an electric vehicle together, although Ford remains a major investor in the start-up automaker. The companies formed a partnership in 2019 when Ford invested $500 million in Rivian \n\n**Still Another Key Indicator**  The **F-150 Lightning** joins the lineup around May, 2022; and the E-Transit van is scheduled to arrive for first deliveries in the U.S. late in 2021. And Ford's Lincoln luxury brand has announced that it will launch a \u201cstrikingly modern\u201d first battery electric model in 2022 ... \n\nThey have the infrastructure, the money and the ability to flood the market with affordable EV vehicles - causing This Company To Once again have a $55 dollar stock and BE Number#1 - Most People Will Miss IT... With a Market Value of ONLY 73 Billion in my opinion Ford In Under Valued\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f3t0ygrfeni81.jpg?width=1400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4c2808a3c0cb2936551fdf8c0ab1a5fed816fdc0", "id": "svr360", "created_utc": 1645214730.0, "score": 21, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "num_comments": 81, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|45|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|356|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o7197c/the_truth_of_how_a_penny_stock_made_a_recovery/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mia2sd/rton_realtime_penny_stock_worth_looking_at/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qrrdh8/evgo_the_move_no_one_expected/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lpetqq/icon_this_is_what_you_need/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lvr1gh/wnbd_one_to_talk_about/) \n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=svr360)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=svr360)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.29990339279174805}, {"body": "The blue thingy looks like cock and balls", "score": 51, "replies": [{"body": "Better get that checked if yours luck blue ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640)", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "NOW That Is FUNNY!!!!!![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.21163389086723328}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.40483909845352173}, {"body": "Welp I can't unsee that now.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1712975949048996}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.28528544306755066}, {"body": "Now, now - we here to talk about Ford Making the Transition from Fossil Fuel to EV and gaining back their #1 SPOT", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.043903548270463943}, {"body": "im in now.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.09507816284894943}, {"body": "I\u2019m deceased from this comment", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.07423324137926102}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.026034021750092506}, {"body": "I\u2019d buy a Ford EV fleshlight", "score": 7, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.33518585562705994}, {"body": "With a PE < 4, you gotta buy", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "see, you understand the Profit opportunity - Summer coming, Covid19 going away and the country is more relaxed and we have over 3 million new Retail Investors", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.315232515335083}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.13808673620224}, {"body": "It's weird when you capitalize random words in a sentence, and I struggle taking people seriously when they do it.\n\nAnyways I like Ford and like the stock so thanks for confirming my bias and stuff, but you're still an idiot.", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "its a style of writing I learned back the 80's to help the mind remember what it has seen and the Highlighted word stand out - Key Indicators of the memory - tomorrow you will remember those key indicators...
