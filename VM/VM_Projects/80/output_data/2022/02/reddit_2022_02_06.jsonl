Google put up over 3 times the growth rate of Apple!!\n\nout of all the FANGs you have Google growing by far the fastest. The bigger Google gets the faster they grow.\n\nGoogle still has tons of assets that the have yet to monetize or fully monetized.\n\nTake Android. Over a billion devices activated per year and Google does not charge a cent. They could do a nominal license fee of $10 and add over $10 billion of revenue which really would be profit as it would not add any new expense.\n\nBut Android is just one example. Google has so many others which just make a massive runway for Google. So if growth starts to slow Google has plenty of levers to pull to keep it going for a very long time. Plus Google keeps adding new ones.\n\nPeople forget that Google is half the age of Microsoft and Apple. It is only a matter of time until Google passes Apple. They already blew past Microsoft. Google has more revenue and makes a lot more than Microsoft or Amazon or Facebook or Netflix. FANG is Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google.\n\nGoogle is also going to do a 20:1 stock split which means they can now join the DJIA. Probably replacing IBM but it could be CSCO (Cisco). That will also give an additional strong tailwind.\n\nBut the other thing really going for Google is the financial engineering. Google bought back over $50 billion in their own shares in 2021. That means less outstanding shares which then just increases EPS as there are less shares.\n\nGoogle had over $65 billion in free cash flow in 2021. They also have over $140 billion in cash just doing basically nothing. Google could really increase their buyback and that significantly decreases shares. So share price appreciations with Google basically doing nothing. Why they call it financial engineering.\n\nBTW, in the past people would say there is this law of large numbers. Which was such a croc. It was the reason given for Apple growth slowing. Well Google has finally put that to rest. The bigger Google gets the faster they grow. They are now an over $250 billion dollar business. Will be well over $300 billion next year.\n\nI am old but I have never seen a more amazing company. The fastest in history to get to 1 trillion market cap. Then the fastest to $2 trillion. Amazon is actually three years older than Google and why the records are with Google.\n\nPeople think Google genius is with their technology.
