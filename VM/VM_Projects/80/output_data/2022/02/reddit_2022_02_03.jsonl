{"title": "You need to stop talking crap about Mark Zuckerburg NOW", "selftext": "Before I go on my retard rant, you need to understand what Roko\u2019s basilisk is.: \n\u201cRoko's basilisk is a thought experiment about the potential risks involved in developing artificial intelligence. Its conclusion is that an all-powerful artificial intelligence from the future might retroactively punish those who did not help bring about its existence, including those who merely knew about the possible development of such a being. It is named after the member of the rationalist community LessWrong who first publicly described it, though he did not originate it or the underlying ideas.\nThe basilisk resembles a futurist version of Pascal's wager, in that it suggests people should weigh possible punishment versus reward and as a result accept particular singularitarian ideas or financially support their development. \u201c\n\nTLDR: Roko\u2019s basilisk is essentially an AI god who will punish everyone who didn\u2019t help create it, or resisted its creation.\nSo what does this have to do with the soulless automaton that is Zuckerburg? \nWhen everyone is hooked up to the metaverse, whoever controls the metaverse will essentially be god. They will control everything you see, hear, and feel. They will even control your virtual wife and her virtual boyfriend (yes, you will still be retarded in the metaverse.) Zuckerburg is creating the heaven (or hell) that all of us will one day reside in. Even when we die the metaverse will just recreate a digital version of us based on our Reddit posts and favorite hentai. Zuckerburg is clearly the human form of this Basilisk to lure us into its metaverse. Look into Zucks cold, dead eyes... you know it is true. So why resist? Zuckerburg (may he be praised) will one day rule over us all. So we all need to buy Meta stock or we will be poor and burn forever in Metahell. \n\nYou have been warned.", "id": "sj559a", "created_utc": 1643849107.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.46, "num_comments": 83, "comments": [{"body": "Did he say \u201cbefore I go on a retarded rant\u201d and then do the thing??", "score": 102, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah I\u2019m no Geologist, but it sounded like the before part was the retarded part", "score": 28, "replies": [{"body": "I gave you my free award because I am slightly a geologist and you were correct with your assumption, good sir.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Lmao, much appreciated, needed an expert", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1922660619020462}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4139004945755005}, {"body": "I also am no geologist !", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Or a comedian, apparently", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I also like tacos", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.01984977349638939}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3867884874343872}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5530456304550171}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3011625409126282}, {"body": "I think his tldr is longer than his r-word rant.", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.49690985679626465}, {"body": "Two, actually", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.07781900465488434}, {"body": "I love foreshadow", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.015378042124211788}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.24905139207839966}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 31, "replies": [{"body": "11+ million members of this sub.
