The market currently has many variables that IV doesn\u2019t account for.\n\nThat's... not how IV works.\n\nIV (_edit:_ or, more accurately, the _expectation_ of volatility) is a key \"input\" in options pricing.  When ~~IV~~ _volatility is expected_ to be high, it absolutely guarantees higher options premiums compared to when IV is lower, all else being equal.  That's a mathematical certainty.  It's not something that needs to account for anything in the market.  It goes up when things are volatile, and it goes down as price action settles.  It usually goes down after earnings, but this time it seems to be staying high for longer - but it is very likely to come back down again as price action compresses to find its feet again. \n\nTo give a concrete example of how much this can hurt, if you look at a May20 200 Put, for example, it's premium is currently asking 18.15.  If FB was to remain at the same price (198.45) but IV falls from 45 down to around 25 (where FB tends to rest after earnings), then the premium on that May20 200P will fall to around $10.  That's a 45% drop.

It has 1k shares, valued at $1k each. Company X  pays a divided of 100k, all of cash on hand. The PV of profit is unchanged, so the value of the company is now 900k. The value of each share drops to $900, plus the shareholder has $100 cash, which is taxed immediately. If instead, company X does a share buyback, it buys 100 shares. There are now 900 shares outstanding, market cap is 900k. The value of a share is 1k. As it was before the distribution.\n\nDo you see?
