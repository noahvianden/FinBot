{"title": "Making money when the market tanks? Impossible!", "selftext": "Okay hear me out... maybe it is not impossible? However, the comments on this sub over the last few months have shown a form of verbal loss porn only comparable to the degenerates over at WallStreetBets. One may even be in disbelief that selling puts is not a golden solution for all markets. \n\n**First off, let's talk about The Wheel**\n\nFor those who may not be familiar, the wheel flows like:\n\n\\-> Sell puts on a regular basis -> Put goes ITM and you take assignment -> Sell calls at (ideally) cost basis -> Call goes ITM and you take assignment -> Sell puts on a regular basis -> you get the idea.\n\nThe wheel is lovely. The wheel has brought fortune for many over the last few years. But many people on this sub have found themselves bag-holding assigned shares and selling calls well below cost basis just to try to make more than $1/week. This is due the design of the wheel - **it is ultimately a neutral-bullish strategy**. The wheel requires flat or upward movement to continue collecting profitable premiums while assuming the risk of owning the shares.\n\n**The Fat Truth**\n\nWhether or not you believe we are in truly in a bear market, *the last 6 months have been the 2nd greatest downturn of the S&P500 in the last 12 years.* That's right folks, only the COVID crash currently has us beat, but that didn't last over 6 months. I'm not here to provide predictions as to where the market is going, but rather share how to take advantage of the trend over the last few months.\n\n**Okay, so if the wheel isn't working, is there anything else a trader can do?**\n\nWhy, yes there is! I thought you would never ask! Similar to how the wheel is a neutral-bullish strategy, there are several other strategies that are neutral-bearish:\n\n1. ***Call Credit Spread*** \\- Sell a call and buy another call at a higher strike for the same expiration date\n\nSome will argue that a spread is not a true theta strategy, but I say it's close enough. Spreads are nice due to the defined risk and reduced capital requirement. Additionally, the farther the spread, the more the short call starts to simulate a naked call. The strategy allows for a small amount of upward movement to realize full profits and thus is neutral-bearish.\n\n2. ***Put Debit Spread*** \\- Buy a put and sell another put at a lower strike for the same expiration date\n\nVery similar P/L to a a call credit spread. The more ITM the puts are, the more upward movement is allowed, but lower potential gains as well. Switching between a CCS and a PDS depending on a green or red day may have a trader capitalize on more gains.\n\n**But what about if the market reveals itself to be a bleeding red bear market?**\n\nThankfully, more aggressive strategies exist!\n\n3. ***Delta Buster*** \\- Combination of an ATM put debit spread and an OTM call credit spread\n\nThis is one of my favorites. With the ATM PDS, the premium is significantly higher. However, the risk is higher as *any* upward movement will cause losses. Thankfully, the credit from OTM CCS offsets the loss. As a result, downward movement of the stock can result in significant gains while upward movement is only a minor loss... as long as the CCS stays OTM. Otherwise it can be a bad day.\n\n4. ***Synthetic short*** \\- Buying a put and selling a call for the same strike and same expiration date\n\nPretty cut and dry. Stock goes down, money is made. Stock goes up, money is lost. The benefit is that you don't have to pay interest on what would otherwise be borrowed shares. However, just like a real short, this strategy has unlimited loss potential on the upside.\n\n5. ***Put ZEBRA*** \\- Buy 2x of an ITM put and sell one ATM put for the same expiration date\n\nIf the idea of a synthetic short is favorable, but the unlimited potential loss is too scary, then the put ZEBRA is the answer! The ZEBRA (Zero Extrinsic Value Back Ratio Spread) stock replacement strategy has a similar profit profile as a synthetic short. If the stock goes down, an equal amount of money is made. However, on the upside, the losses plateau at the initial cost. As a result, the strategy looks like a synthetic short, but with capped losses. The Put ZEBRA will require more buying power than a synthetic short.   \nFun fact: If the ZEBRA were replaced with calls vice puts, the P/L chart looks very similar to owning shares, except the losses are capped at the initial cost of the strategy. \n\n**And what about if the market goes back up?**\n\nThen I encourage traders to resume using the wheels. A good trader knows how to make money regardless of the direction. If a strategy is working well, keep doing it! If a strategy was previously working well, but has been recently incurring loss, then it might be time to step back, look at how the market has been behaving, and reassess if a strategy change is needed. Keep in mind that of the five strategies presented, 1 & 2 are the only neutral-bearish. Strategies 3, 4, and 5 are purely bearish and will not work if the market decides to flatten or go back up. \n\n**Is OP some sort of financial specialist providing investment advise?** \n\nNope. I'm actually a financial adversary who helps people lose money. Please fact check my work and do your own due diligence. \n\n**TLDR**: Strategies 1-5 are some of the potential ways to make money when the market is bleeding red.

Buy 1 IWM 167 put expires August 25 sell 1 IWM 168 put also expires August 25. This is your put debit spread. Max loss $100.\n Buying power cost $100. \n\nI wouldn't sell the spread for less than $10. Sticking with this rule makes p/l decisions much simpler, and I don't run any calculations.\n\nI also wouldn't sell these spreads at a delta over 0.15. I also don't sell multiples of the same contract for the same expiration date. There are plenty of expirations and indexes to choose from with similar metrics. These two criteria reduce risk and have saved the trade a few times. If it's a bad trade, I only lose once.\n\nSo, now I have $100 risked and I'm trying to keep the trade OTM until it expires worthless, and keep my $10. This is a problem with the market generally bearish with high volatility. Everything seems fine on green days, but the red moves have been bigger. \n\nFar expiry provides some opportunity to capitalize on green days and move the spread down. For a 60 days to expiration option that trades 3x per week, you get around 20 rolling opportunities. So I set up a GTC (Good To Close) roll order down to the next strikes and next expiry  (166/167 on August 28, in this example) and wait. I set the order price super low, usually $4. \n\nThe roll will usually execute at open, or during a green first market hour. Sometimes 10 rolls will pop off at open, all for a small profit. These market fakes often start off an overall red day, but I'm already down a strike and juiced my profits a but. Making $1/day and reducing my risk by $100 at the same time is just fine with me. I just keep rolling for a small profit until I'm comfortable with the strike. If the spread is around 10% OTM, I will stop rolling and let it expire. On the last day I might sell the long leg for a bit more profit and let the short leg expire worthless if I'm really comfortable.\n\nThis has even worked for f'n TESLA, where I stand to lose $2500 if I give up and let it expire ITM. I'm chipping away at it and there is still a chance at a profit instead of a big loss. No more stock options after TESLA. It's indexes going forward for me. \n\nA response to those guys critical of rolling that say \"if you wouldn't take the trade today, don't bother rolling it\": Well, this method has had some success in keeping the trade within its original parameters, until the market moves my way. I don't see many \"other, better ways to deploy my capital\" at the moment either. \n\nTL:DR:\n\nSell a narrow put credit spread way OTM with 21-60 DTE. Roll it out and down consistently, but not far in strike or calendar, with GTC orders. Wait for your rolls to outpace price declines and collect a small premium for doing it.\n\nPS: At the moment, I'm at my BP limit with around 50 spreads in action. 22 GTC roll orders are open today. This method is earning about $25/day, which does add up pretty fast. 8 spreads expire this week, with probability OTM from 86%-97%.
