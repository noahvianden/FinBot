{"title": "Dividend stocks are the key to sitting still in this economic uncertainty", "selftext": "Given the ups and downs of the market right now the safest bet is finding stable companies that pay high dividends. The goal is to capture a decent dividend given the economic climate for long term growth. What I see is all stocks will fluctuate with the market but stable, high dividend, less exposed stocks is the way to go.  Make sure you reinvest the dividends. \n\nNOW you won't make the money that people who invest in the big swings stocks and prospect stocks get but you will have a stable nest egg. \n\nIf we look at certain companies who pay dividends and make consistent revenue and profits, with the uncertainty happening right now, in my opinion it will recover, so you will get the price back + dividends that hopefully beat inflation.\n\nFord has an okay dividend but depending on how the execution of electric cars will be a deciding factor. **BUT meanwhile** Monsanto will earn hand over fist in cash no matter what. Alcoa who produces aluminum, will also be safe for a very long time (yes tariffs and trade can affect them but they are not going anywhere).  Step up and take Coca-Cola and you have a good dividend with not much upside but not much downside. \n\nRight now I put my money into relatively stable companies that just give dividends and won't dissapear over night.", "id": "w5pac2", "created_utc": 1658534108.0, "score": 24, "upvote_ratio": 0.7, "num_comments": 82, "comments": [{"body": "I prefer to fomo in after a 75% spike and ride it down to 0 but you do you bro ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)", "score": 72, "replies": [{"body": "This way Reddit will one day beat big money.

Rather, dividends are essentials the owners telling the executives that they dont trust them fully or they dont trust the business fully. Thats what dividends are all about. Its a hedge against the people running the business in case they screw up. If you dont take the cash, it will just get burned on BS 9/10 times.\n\nThis is a lesson that most everyone learns over time but young folks havent fully realized it yet.

But look at the paltry returns over past years pre-crazy inflation. Also, 10k per year max per SS# is nothing, and if 10k IS meaningful to an investor they probably can't afford let it sit at treasurydirect for a year. Sure, you can get an additional 5k from your tax return, but you'd be stupid to get such a large return and have given the government a 5k interest free loan. And the biggie... the interest rate will adjust down quickly as high inflation gets lapped. The rate is based on the y/y CHANGE in CPI, which will revert to zero as disinflation occurs. \n\nIt's a good thing I-bonds cannot pay a negative rate.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["inflation", "cpi"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.41188687086105347}, {"body": "Except for the part when they get hammered 10-15%", "score": -2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.11196853220462799}, {"body": "weary adjoining exultant work fragile expansion late zesty familiar depend\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)*", "score": -2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1665242463350296}, {"body": "Go to YT and search \"the irrilevance of dividends\".", "score": -3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3384247124195099}, {"body": "I\u2019ve made a recent post about KO and some dividend stocks in particular.
