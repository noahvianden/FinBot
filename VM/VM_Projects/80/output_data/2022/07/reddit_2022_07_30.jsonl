{"title": "Reevaluating my thesis on ROKU: What I got wrong and why I'm still holding", "selftext": "**Original thesis:**\n\n* **Quick introduction**: I've been an investor in ROKU since **2020** right before HBO Max made a deal to be available on ROKU. I've invested **over $100K** into the company via dollar cost average and have lost **+60%** of my investment due to poor stock performance.\n* **Active accounts**: More people are going to cut the cord because cable is more expensive & less flexible than streaming. Along with international expansion, this would have helped ROKU add **+10m** active accounts per a year.\n* **Average revenue per user**: Shift of advertising dollars from Linear TV to Streaming TV. In 2020, **40%** of U.S. TV time was streamed but only **13%** of TV ad budgets were spent on streaming. This would have helped average revenue per user (*ARPU*) as advertisers & their dollars followed potential customers to close the gap and help ROKU grow revenue by **30% - 40%** on an annual basis.\n* **Competitive positioning**: Market leader with **+38%** of U.S. streaming players & **+33%** of U.S. smart TVs has their operating system. Impressive that they have maintained a competitive lead for over a decade against the largest tech companies in the world including Amazon, Google, Apple, Samsung, and LG.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What has changed from my past thesis that's negative:**\n\n* **Active Accounts will be lower-than-expected**: ROKU pulled forward multiple years of customer growth during the COVID pandemic as people were stuck at home & needed a smart TV. So the company is closer to maturity as it penetrated most of its TAM especially in the U.S. My expectation for active account growth is to be **5m - 8m** per year, which will primarily be low-value accounts from their international expansion that have a lower monetization value along with a few high-value U.S. accounts that will be acquired as households continue to leave cable & defections from competition.\n* **More cyclical than I thought**: I thought that ROKU would enjoy a **30% - 40%** revenue CAGR as advertising dollars shift from linear TV to streaming TV. But, ROKU just withdrew it's guidance for **35% y/y** revenue growth in FY '22 and will most likely only grow in the **high-teens** as advertisers pull back on marketing spend in response to the economy.\n* **OneView & the dynamic programmatic ads is overrated**: They are immaterial to the business and it's best to focus on the fundamental blocks for the company today. ROKU primarily gets most of their advertising dollars from the scatter market and a little from upfronts. The ads will work similarly as linear TV.  I'm not going to get distracted by the other parts of the business.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What has changed from my past thesis that's positive:**\n\n* **Netflix & other streaming players offering an AVOD option**: My base case was that Netflix & most of the larger streaming apps would offer an ad-free subscription. But, Netflix & Disney + are now more open-minded to an AVOD (*advertising video on demand option*), which may attract more households to leave cable because they can now better afford subscriptions since the AVOD options generally are priced at a 25% - 50% discount. This provides a little relief to my outlook for ROKU's active account growth, but I'm more excited this will help boost my outlook for ROKU's ARPU since ROKU gets a **20% - 30%** share of advertising.\n* **Sports being offered on streaming**: Three items I see holding back households from leaving cable: it would be too expensive to bundle multiple streaming apps to watch all of the content a household wants, no sports, and no news. The AVOD options from streaming apps addresses point 1 while streaming apps are also addressing point 2.  NFL, NBA, MLB, and MLS are now available to be streamed that I didn't expect before especially given the lucrative deals all of these leagues  originally signed to be on linear TV.\n* **IDFA, digital privacy changes from Apple, and upcoming for Google**: I didn't expect this to happen. This is making it really difficult for advertisers to efficiently target customers that rely on tracking customers based on their iPhone activity. I expect Google to do something similar for Android & Chrome. ROKU stands to benefit not only from linear TV ad dollars shifting to streaming, but also ad dollars from mobile as advertisers look for an effective option to target customers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What hasn't changed from my past thesis:**\n\n* **Shift from cable to streaming**: **47.6%** of U.S. households stream and is expected to be **57.6%** by 2026\n* **Shift of advertising dollars from Linear TV to Streaming TV: 50%** of U.S. TV time is streamed, but only **22%** of TV ad budgets is spent on streaming. That gap will need to close as advertisers need to follow where the customers are at.\n* **Competitive positioning**: ROKU has maintained a competitive lead for over a decade against the largest tech companies in the world including Amazon, Google, Apple, Samsung, and LG. If these companies couldn't topple ROKU for over a decade and ROKU hasn't slipped in their product roadmap, how can one seriously expect them to change that dynamic?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Why I'm still holding and I may buy more:**\n\n* **Balancing my original thesis against things that have changed**: Most of my original thesis **remains**, but has been **weakened** due to me overestimating customer growth after the pandemic, the secular resilience of the company, and the impact of initiatives that are a small part of their business. There are a few new items like tailwinds from AVOD streaming options, sports, and IDFA tailwinds. But on a net-net, my thesis has been the weakened and ROKU's stock already reflects that by going from the **high $400s to the $60s**.\n* **TINA**: I can't think of many stocks that will generate strong shareholder value in a challenging stock market & macro environment. **There is no alternative** so I figured how about I stay & invest in a beaten down company and ROKU's stock will probably rise a lot faster than other stocks when the environment improves since it's a smaller company, more sensitive to an improving economy given the reliance on advertising spend, ROKU is not losing to competitors, and streaming TV is not losing to other industries.\n* **Negative stock perception**: The recent earnings call was horrible for ROKU and analysts across Wall Street has responded with downgrades including Bank of America with a **$55** price target. I find it difficult to find good opportunities in stocks that everyone crowds around and I'm hoping to take advantage of the poor sentiment today, ROKU continuing to execute with all of the tailwinds in streaming TV industry, and eventually ROKU's stock will go up when the economy & advertising spend improves\n* **Potential acquisition target if things get really bad**: ROKU is the #1 TV operating system and has over 60m accounts. The company's market cap is over **$8 billion**, so it's a feasible & attractive acquisition target for a big tech company that wants to be the gatekeeper in the streaming TV ecosystem. I expect ROKU to weather the tough economy, keep executing, and continue operating as an independent company. But, it makes me comfortable that ROKU does a really good job at its niche and many companies will find what ROKU does is attractive if an acquisition is potentially the best exit option for investors.", "id": "wc6q3r", "created_utc": 1659213229.0, "score": 20, "upvote_ratio": 0.68, "num_comments": 73, "comments": [{"body": "What\u2019s on roku or any streaming devices that isn\u2019t readily available on a smart TV?", "score": 25, "replies": [{"body": "Roku is in smart TVs.\n\nChoice between the boxes is mostly it's a matter of fringe channels and the quality of the device and interface.\n\nThey are pretty fungible at this point.", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "Roku is on very low quality TVs.

If they buy brands that ROKU runs then sure it's great. But if they buy Samsung, Vizio, or LG, then ROKU loses. Worse, that is not a one time loss but a continual loss of future revenue from that consumer for multiple years. So it is surprising that ROKU doesn't push really hard to capture those customers. \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFor the other approach of just earning from people using their service outside of a ROKU OS TV, the competition is way too strong now with everyone having their own streaming service. If ROKU had went out and bought the rights to a bunch of content that was exclusively theirs, they could have competed. However, that is not cheap. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nI don't know if ROKU even wants to be that and battle Netflix/Disney/P+ etc. or if they are happy being the cheaper and lower quality content provider.

Except when someone brought them up back then, they were shunned. Now suddenly everyone is listening... sheeps will sheep I guess, hence the username.\n\nProblem 1\n\nManagement is not good.\n\nRoku OS was a high risk move. Frankly, I think its a big mistake. By going proprietary they lost access to Android apps and any opportunity that would have provided. Given they dont make their own content, they needed all the help they can get. The efficiency gains of a stripped down OS were not worth it because the hardware is stupid cheap and always was. Software is far more costly and who wants to make software for multiple platforms? No one. So now Roku is in a corner where they no longer have community support. They put themselves in a position where if they lose users or if apps dont make money, devs will leave (along with their apps). Not wise. This, to me, shows lack of vision and or a gambler mentality with a side dash of illusions of grandeur.\n\nProblem 2\n\nDependency. Earnings are fickle.\n\nRoku is dependent on 3rd parties for content and their end game revenue stream will be ads that run alongside content they cant control. This is a bad place to be today. Who cant create their own streaming service or stick today? All of them can. Roku, instead of focusing on going vertical and being masters of their own destiny, kept going off tangents making hardware and such. Again, not wise. When they had money they needed to either buy a studio or start making their own content. They had the money for it. At least then they would have exclusive content to fall back on. Again bad risk mitigation by management.\n\nProblem 3\n\nPeople dont use Roku the way Roku wants.\n\nThere is a huge % of Roku owners who never use Rokus streaming services. They use 3rd party apps instead and Roku cannot use their apps for ads. If they tried, those services will leave Roku in a heartbeat (like Prime, Netflix, Disney, Plex, Jellyfin, etc). Which goes back to problem 2 above. But the point here is there is no telling what % of users actually use Roku in a way that they can even monetize it. I wouldnt be surprised if it were less than 50%.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["nflx"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["amzn", "nflx", "aapl"]}
