{"title": "BABA Stock de-listing: Questions", "selftext": "Hi All,\n\nI own BABA and have a number of questions around this potential de-listing. I hope it is appropriate for this sub (since it is stocks) and hoping this will help anyone else in my shoes.\n\n1. When a company is de-listed from a stock exchange does it's value fall to zero?\n2. China has announced that BABA may potentially have a dual-primary listing in HK? What are the implications? Can i simply transfer my shares from US to HK? (I have trading permissions on  HKEX)\n3. Since the US stock (BABA) is an ADR and the HK stock (9988) is a secondary listing, are there any implications for this transfer or is it as simple as moving from one exchange to the other by the broker(like IBKR)?\n4. The current BABA price is USD 89. The current 9988 price in HKEX is 89 HKD. However, 1 USD = 7.85 HKD. If i have 100 BABA shares do they get transferred as 100 shares of 9988 or will FX be taken into account? (If FX is not taken into account, then the value of my shares will reduce by 7.85 since the price is roughly equal)\n\nLike a lot of BABA shareholders (bagholders?) i am very worried and want to know the implications before i decide to cut my losses and sell it off. The other option is to not look at news and HODL!!! or play the \"chicken\" game but this is a good opportunity to learn about de-listing and share transfer. \n\nIf any of you are knowledgeable about this, i really could use your help.\n\nThank you in advance!", "id": "wcntj3", "created_utc": 1659271281.0, "score": 156, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 89, "comments": [{"body": "Please don't make financial decisions solely off redditors advice (ironic I know), but some people here have not been investing for very long, have very little stake and lack the knowledge necessary to give advice, always confirm information here using your own research or through an advisor. But I'll give my take:\n\n1. The delisting will be from exchanges such as NYSE and NASDAQ, not that you won't be able to trade it. Under HFCAA, the SEC has a list of all the companies potentially being delisted. There are no companies listed that are currently trading OTC, some big ones being Tencent (OTC:TCEHY), so we can assume that after delisting, BABA will be trading on the OTC exchange probably under BABAY. There is actually an ordinary share version already trading there, BABAF, that has low liquidity.\n\n2. BABA's move to a primary listing in HK doesn't directly affect you. What it signals is that Chinese companies will start to IPO more in HK and China than before on US exchanges. It indirectly benefits you because a primary HK listing will make it easier for mainland Chinese investors to invest in BABA.\n\n3. You can already transfer BABA ADRs to HK's 9988 depending on your broker. I know IBKR allows this, so does Fidelity, which I use. In my experience with other OTC Chinese stocks, trading them on HK exchange after hours is simple, but you might have to pay some fees to do so, it's best to call your broker for clarification.\n\n4. BABA and 9988 shares are fungible, at an 8-1 ratio, 8 9988 shares for 1 ADR. FX of course has to be taken into account when calculating the 2 prices. Institutional investors constantly switch between the 2 exchanges, which is why the price movement of both follows closely with each other. If the spread is too high, a simple arbitrage opportunity arises and you can basically make free money by selling one and buying the other.\n\nI'll give my take on the stock but you should make your own decisions. BABA of course a huge company and part of every day life. De-listing in my opinion is not the primary risk, or even a huge risk at this point, but whether regulatory scrutiny in China is so strong that competitors start to outpace BABA's growth and take market share. The problem here is the huge uncertainty behind \"Chinese regulatory scrutiny\", and  that risk is at least partially already in the price. De-listing will depress the price in the short term, but won't really affect prices in the long term, after all you could have bought Tencent more than a decade ago without it being exchange-listed, you could buy it now without the risk of de-listing either.", "score": 133, "replies": [{"body": "Since you seem to have a fair amount of knowledge can I ask you opinion on delisting? Do you think it will happen?", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "TLDR, it was 50-50, now its probably 75-25 to not delisting, less likely if trade tariffs get resolved. Chinese ADRs like JD and BIDU not being down a lot is probably an indication that US investors are pricing in low chances of delisting.\n\nI personally think that the US threat of delisting is more of a geopolitical and economic game than to truly protect investors, the stated reason for delisting. I'm not saying that some Chinese companies aren't doing misleading things to US investors but for those big ones or dual listed ones, they would have to be scamming both sides of the Pacific and that is difficult to do. Also, based on sentiment here in the US as well as statements by previous and current administration, I think there is a thinly-veiled attempt of trying to curb the rise of the Chinese economy and one easy way to do so would be to prevent money flows to Chinese IPOs. It's not \"innocent until proven guilty\" as in \"listed until scams are proven\" but more assume everything Chinese is guilty and only proven innocent if Chinese ADRs change their structure. Unfortunately here, China also seems resistant to changing its policies on tech-related ADRs, something I disagree with since I believe there is more benefit for tech stocks with more financial openness despite China's stated privacy concerns. \n\nSo things are still not very clear and it seems like a game of chicken, either US has to be less hawkish towards China or China has to slow its regulations on tech giants, but there is also hope because the big money here has a stake in continuing to list Chinese IPOs here. For example, exchanges like the NYSE and Nasdaq as well as big banks have a financial stake in international integration because they make money when you trade ADRs here as well as IPOs here. If this was moved to HK, the HK exchange and Chinese banks will obviously benefit. Some technocrats in the Chinese government also see a benefit to continued US listings as of course there is higher valuations and more money for investments here. China has stated they want to keep companies listed in the US and [recent events like the CSRS giving in to some demands](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/04/09/chinas-regulators-warm-to-american-listings) have probably given greater chance to delisting of Chinese companies not happening. I would say this though, a resolution to the trade tariffs is much more important to both the US and China, and if it increasing looks like that will happen, delisting will probably not happen either.

Luckin Coffee was delisted because of fraud, which I assume you agree is much worse than not allowing an audit because of exogeneous factors like regulations that affect every stock. Yet a couple weeks ago, it was trading only at slightly lower prices than around its IPO and much higher (7+ times) than when it was actually delisted. Didi, which is facing the greatest regulatory scrutiny of any Chinese ADR, announced its delisting late May, was delisted in early June, and the price now is somehow higher than it was back then? It seems the rule for delisted Chinese stocks is to buy on the literal date the delisting was announced.
