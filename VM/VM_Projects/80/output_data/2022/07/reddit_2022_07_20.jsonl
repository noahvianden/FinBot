Spoiler alert: real life is messier than a spreadsheet model.\n\nI had no clue what I was doing and invested in two mutual funds and 10 individual stocks.  I don\u2019t recall ever hearing or learning about ETFs back then.  I started working real jobs during this time and continued investing in stocks biweekly in my new 401k  retirement account, while my brokerage account languished.  It took 16 years\u2014not 7 years\u2014to fully recover my initial investment, including dividends from CVX and T. I had two stocks crater to $0.  Other individual stocks like AMD didn\u2019t recover until 2016-2019, nearly 20 years later.  It was the definition of dead money.\n\nSo, why did I forgo a DCA strategy, when it\u2019s widely considered on this sub to be the holy grail of investing? Pursuing a DCA strategy during that time period using my brokerage account made little sense, because trade commissions were like $15 for each stock and $25 for mutual funds.  DCA biweekly or monthly would\u2019ve cost a fortune in transaction costs.  More importantly, high yield savings accounts and CDs during that period earned 4%-7% annually with no risk, at least prior to 2009.  You need to factor this opportunity cost into your hypothetical analysis to calculate a true break even point for stocks.  These vehicles easily outperformed my brokerage account during these years, and I used them to build an emergency fund, buy a house, and start a family.  I valued safety and preserving capital during a very tumultuous time, when my wife and I both contended with layoffs and job insecurity during two recessions.  Seeing my stock portfolio decimated twice within an 8 year period made me very risk averse at that juncture. I wanted to survive financially and build my life at the expense (only in hindsight, after a massive bull run) of maximizing my long term net worth.\n\nI realize things are different now in many respects, but I\u2019m sharing my story as a cautionary tale for younger investors.  Life is messy.  Looking at a historical chart of SPY over time is overly simplistic and may give you a false sense of security or inevitability.  An investing strategy that makes sense to you today may not make sense in the future, because your own life circumstances, and financial markets, will both continue to change and evolve.

Are you talking Solar or EV or what?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Energy drives all life. It always has. As energy gets easier to get, life changes around it. It wasnt that long ago when people had to spend 12 hours a day working else face death. Then we had improvements to food systems and suddenly people had more time for arts and other activities. Later we had industry and mass production and we had even more free time which led to even further innovation and luxuries. Well we are about to see another fundamental shift.\n\nSolar is now the cheapest form of energy you can generate. Nothing can compete any more and the efficiency keeps improving while install costs have come down. In time it will be cheap even in low sun hour areas. Thats leg 1.\n\nLeg 2 is storing energy and that will happen in the form of more efficient batteries and energy conversions to other forms of storage (h2 would make sense). But battery tech is still in its infancy. It really didnt start to move till the laptop age and then took off with mobile phones. The eV will push the tech to the next level and that will make them good enough for both general home use and industry to scale.\n\nThere are a lot of things we can do with cheap energy that we dont do now. For instance, water. Right now getting water to places where its scarce is both costly and inefficient. But with an abundance of energy this is no longer a problem. Desal plants, which are prohibitive now due to energy cost, will no longer be costly. And on a personal level, anyone can now buy condensation hardware and just generate their own water cheap (too energy intensive otherwise).\n\nMatter transformation. Right now making elements in artificial ways like via chemistry or particle acceleration is costly, for the later, its mostly due to energy costs. I did a research project on making Au (gold) from Hg (Mercury) long ago and found that with $0.15/kwh energy, it will cost about $3500-$4000/oz to make stable isotope Au. Well... energy from solar installed in high sun areas is lower than $0.05/kwh... I havent done the calculation since then (its not a straight line, there is extraction costs and such), but energy was a big portion of the cost. The point here is we might actually be able to make other elements at acceptable cost with cheaper energy. Gold would actually be a waste of time but that was just to make a point.\n\nFarming will benefit significantly from cheap energy because you can bring everything indoor to a fully controlled environment. Right now its expensive to do this due to energy cost. By bringing it all indoor it will lower some of the big costs like pest control and it negates weather (mostly) but most importantly, transportation. You will be able to grow nearly anything anywhere... The outside temperature wont matter any more as long as you have some sun. This would obviously change life everywhere. We will still need big farms for certain things like cheap crops (wheat, rice, soy, etc) but many crops will now be localized and be available everywhere.\n\nManufacturing and automation. Pretty obvious how cheap energy would benefit these. Cheap energy will push for more automation R&D which will lead to localization of manufacturing. In other words, in about a decade or two, manufacturing will come back in droves because it will be cheaper to do locally due to robots and lower transport costs which will out weight labor costs once automation and energy are cheap. This is already happen to some extent, but its still in early phase.\n\nBasically the world is about to change. The public energy infrastructure is going to become less and less relevant. People will have more independence in both electricity and food. This will lead to a fundamental shift in human living behavior (more free time to do other things).", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "Sounds great until it's lobbied against and held back for decades so people can line their pockets with gold.

I dont know the actual term for the \"cracks\" so please correct my terminology. But that is the biggest barrier and it seems they are on the verge of making them usable. \n\nNow obviously just because we can make something doesnt mean it is practical. It may be that so much potential energy in a small area is too dangerous. Maybe its too hard to scale for manufacturing and the cost can never get low enough to be useful. We will see but we should have some form of these batteries soon. Maybe not for cars however.\n\nThe other form of logical storage is simple hydrolysis. We really dont need anything else. Its much better than centralized stuff like nuclear. Hydrogen is easy enough that any household can do it and store it for backup. We used to keep our own fuel and run generators where I am from (Iraq) and its really not hard nor very dangerous. No more than parking a fueled up car in a garage or running gas lines in a house. Nuclear is a waste of time and the cost to maintain it will just keep escalating. LiON batteries are good enough as well and redox will take over at some point once its scaled. \n\nThe price of LiON batteries is in free fall. Ive seen battery cost per kwh drop more than 50% in just about 5 years (mostly thanks to the powerwall) and its about to drop another 50% thanks to Ford (set the recent precedent). So its just a matter of time.\n\nRight now the powerwall costs something like $0.75/wh. The F150 with the car included, seems to make the battery cheaper than $0.40/wh and you figure the battery is probably less than half of the price of the car so in reality they are making those things for less than $0.20/wh. Though we wont see that right away, I gives us a good idea of how cheap these things will get. In 10 years, I think we will get that down to $0.10/wh and at that point it will get installed in droves and thats without any other breakthroughs. This is just old school LiON. Any major breakthroughs will send it even lower. \n\nSo my guess is, the worst case scenario, is 10 years of no breakthroughs and just simple LiON scaling. We get to $0.10/wh batteries and panels will probably closer to $0.25/w (about half of current pricing though we need to adjust to inflation).

Hydrogen storage can be used in utility scale byt hard to pull for residential purposes. Solar panels, despite getting cheaper, will be bound by price of \"materials\" (mostly Silicon and aluminum), this will set a floor price to oil and gas. These plants are simply too cheap to operate, but maybe the transportation costs will set this floor to be really low, I haven't run any analysis on this yet. I believe carbon credit systems have huge headwinds due to the competition for cheap energy between countries.\n\nI like the land idea, but I'm not too sure about it.
