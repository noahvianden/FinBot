That's a significant gain. My max profit if SPY dumps(like it's done a couple times this week) is $374 of PROFIT per contract. Which is huge. Like, thousands of dollars of gains.

Time decay. The reason the price of the stock can move in your favor but your option contract still loses value.\n\nIf I buy puts and spy goes flat, puts lose value every day and throughout each day.\n\nIf I buy spreads and spy goes flat, the top leg loses value because they are bought puts. The bottom leg gains value because those are sold puts. My spreads go relatively flat instead of losing 1/3 value in a day or two. I can sell to close my spreads for a much closer value to what I paid to open them in this scenario, whereas if I buy just puts then in two or three days they are next to worthless compared to what I spent to enter the position.\n\nSo I have a much lower ability to lose my entire entry cost. And I only need a small movement in my favor to make my profit goal.\n\nI'm not gambling on big swings. I'm taking small profits and limiting myself to smaller losses. Lower risk.

Theta isn't that fast. There's still time decay in your scenario, it's just slower. You could also mimic that by a longer-dated option.\n\nAnd really it all comes down to picking the direction correctly. Everything else is just a means of profiting from that. Apparently I am not good at that, mostly because I am contrarian. Buying puts on green days and calls on red days has not paid off. I take profit at 10-20%, but end up riding the losers to expiration.\n\nBut overall it sounds like what I have been trying to do for months. Just recently lost 40% of my account and been digging deeper and deeper holes trying to get back.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah I wasn't using exact math but you get the point. Longer dated options are more expensive because of time value but if you leave them open too long theta grows rapidly and eats away at the price you paid. \n\nWhen that happens you need a much bigger move on the underlying equity to make up the difference, whereas weekly or biweekly spreads don't really have that problem and you can be much closer to the money because you lower your cost basis by capping your profit. Being closer to the money and having less theta decay to worry about makes gaining profits much easier.\n\nPicking the correct direction is key. Right now we're stuck between 370 and 390 for the most part. When we get closer to 390, I debit spread puts a week or two out and I've been pretty lucky. I've also entered call credit spreads when we hit high 380s and that's been profitable.\n\nTry looking at calendar put debit spreads, but on your further expiration add a call in to the mix creating a straddle for that date. Adjust your ratios so there are less sold puts than bought puts, and adjust your strikes on the bought puts and calls so that they aren't the same as your sold puts.
