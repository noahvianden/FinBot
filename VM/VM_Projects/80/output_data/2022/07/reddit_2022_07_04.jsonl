I also don\u2019t mention anything about the \u201cfuture\u201d of the company. No one knows for sure how the future will pan out, so first I like to look at the financial standpoints, and see if it\u2019s worth the risk based on their future. \n\nAs for the rest: \n\nGOOGL: Lowest PE since 2013, but PEG is 1.07. Still considered \u201covervalued\u201d by traditional metrics. PS ratio is still above average at 5.8, but since the company is posting consisting revenue and profit, this can somewhat be ignored. These guys increased their debt by 3x when the pandemic hit, but even then, they\u2019re DTE is still 0.06. Also considering the fact they\u2019re a huge, dominating company, they can afford to take on debt and handle it. I bring in debt because usually in high interest rate environments, small companies tend to not survive or have a hard time.\n\nTSLA: Reason I stay away from this one, is despite the fact that their revenue is increasing and the demand for EV has grown, the current stock price shows they still have a lot to prove. Since they bare starting posting consecutive net profit, I still judge them by their PS ratio, which is still very high at 12.5. They have relatively little debt as well compared to their equity, but if you feel comfortable holding at TODAY\u2019S price, then do so. Keep in mind they must have a perfect plan executed to justify the current stock price, which for me is too much to ask for.\n\nPEP, WM, KO: I won\u2019t even look into these because I know their ratios are relatively high, aka overvalued. But that\u2019s the thing about stable blue chip stocks. Especially these. They\u2019re future is damn near 100% guaranteed. These are the only stocks I\u2019d purchase without worrying about their financial ratios, as long as your comfortable willing to overpay for them.\n\nF: PS and PE ratios look great. But have very high debt to equity. In a high interest rate environment, I wouldn\u2019t hold this. This is a mere bet on the future. Will they be able to catch up to Tesla on the EV tech? I wouldn\u2019t hold if your goal is to preserve wealth. Too risky, there\u2019s better stocks out there.\n\nAMZN: One of my favorites, that I DO NOT own just yet. Just like Google, this company is dominating online retail, and expanding more. But for the purpose of this comment, only financials. PE is still high at 50, though hasn\u2019t been this low since 2015. Many argue, and yes, they are reinvesting into their future, but that still poses huge risk assuming you\u2019re trying to preserve wealth. But that\u2019s the whole point of investing isn\u2019t it? So final answer depends on you. Is this PE justified? Their PEG ratio is 1.49, meaning it\u2019s still overvalued. Needs to drop down 33% from todays price to be a buy for us traditional investors. Will it drop by this much? Who knows, but I don\u2019t care, there\u2019s better buys in other companies right now. No need to rush into this.\n\nGLAD: Young company but doesn\u2019t seem to survive on debt, so that\u2019s good news. PS is still too high historically, so todays price would be a no for me. Dividend is consistently growing so that\u2019s also good news. I guess if you have a good reason for this besides \u201cthe future looks bright\u201d, you should have trust in yourself.\n\nPSEC: Same case as GLAD, with higher debt on its balance sheet. High PS ratio, dividend has had a couple hiccups but still growing. If you trust it, go ahead.\n\nXOM: PE ratio is historically low, but PS ratio is historically high. Low PEG of 0.52. From a traditional standpoint, this is a buy. \n\nI Didn\u2019t cover the ETFs because they\u2019re typically well diversified so there\u2019s no point.\n\nCheck the PS, PE, PB, PFCF, ROE, Margins, Debt to Equity, etc. On the ones I didn\u2019t mention.
