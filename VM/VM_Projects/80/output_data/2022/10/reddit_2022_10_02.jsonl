Otherwise, the conversation can very easily veer off into flamewars and boring, unproductive, discussion.\n\nHere's an example of a political comment that doesn't offer any value:\n\n* \"I hate this new green policy from the Biden administration. What a fucking idiot\"\n\nNow compare it to this:\n\n* \"I hate this new green policy from the Biden administration. It threatens the profit margins of oil companies because they will need to expand their OpEx. I have calls on Shell that are going to get decimated at open.\"\n\nThe latter is significantly more interesting and offers a great jumping point into market related discussion.\n\nPut succinctly: If you choose to start or engage in arguments about libtards or Nazis instead of making fun of their bad SPY long then you're in the wrong place and we'll show you the door.\n\nIf you're not sure if your content is political, it probably is, and there's probably a better way to post it without making things weird.\n\n---\n\nAll that being said, we are here to help.
