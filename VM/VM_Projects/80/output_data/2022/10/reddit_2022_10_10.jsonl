{"title": "Don't trust Gary Blacks Q4 delivery FUD.", "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\ntoday i want to discuss Tesla's Q4 production and deliveries while pushing back on FUD from Gary Black.\n\nFor those who don't know, Gary Black is a prominent member of the Tesla investment community who found popularity on Twitter in the last year or two. He is the manager of the Future Fund, a growth oriented ETF, which has Tesla as its largest position (around 10% iirc). His 6-12 month price target on Tesla is $550.\n\nAnd yet, while Mr. Black is obviously bullish longterm on Tesla , he often Tweets bearish talking points while claiming he's just \"keeping it real\".\n\nAfter Tesla's recent Q3 delivery miss, he Tweeted that China demand \"dried up\".\n\n[https://twitter.com/garyblack00/status/1579258313212334080](https://twitter.com/garyblack00/status/1579258313212334080)\n\nHe then goes on to suggest that Q4 deliveries could experience similar pressure if Chinese buyers decide to push deliveries hoping for a price cut.\n\nHe also asserts something similar could happen in the US with regars to the EV tax credit.\n\nHe claims because Tesla is his fund's largest position he has no incentive to see it fall, but that's not exactly true because a cheaper stock provides his fund with the opportunity to buy and lower their average cost which increases their funds returns if/when Tesla eventually gets to his $550 price target.\n\nWhat Mr. Black doesn't talk about is the data. What he doesn't talk about is Tesla's backlog which seemingly contradicts his claims. Here: [https://insideevs.com/news/610971/estimated-tesla-order-backlog-falling/](https://insideevs.com/news/610971/estimated-tesla-order-backlog-falling/) Troy posts an estimate based on wait times of Tesla's delivery backlog. As you can see, based on these estimates Tesla's backlog has fallen from 496k at the end of Q2 to 414k at the end of Q3. While the backlog decreased for the first time in over a year so did Tesla's production and deliveries. Remember, Tesla delivered 343k cars during the quarter. This means we can do some simple math to approximate how many new orders were placed during the quarter.\n\nIf Tesla had no new orders place in Q3 it's backlog would have fallen to 153k. (496k backlog - 343k deliveries). But since the backlog at the end of the quarter was 414k, that means at least 261k new orders were placed (414k-153k). And this is why no one should be worried about Q4 deliveries. If we assume Tesla receives another 260k new orders in Q4, then Tesla could easily deliver 450k-500k cars and Tesla will still have a remaining order backlog between 200-225k.\n\nFurthermore, if you look at Troy's chart, you'll notice he breaks out his estimates by region. The backlog is roughly even at about 200k for Shanghai and 200k for Fremont. So, there is plenty of demand left in China. So much that Tesla can probably satisfy Q4 deliveries for China regions just by servicing their backlog.\n\nBut what about China customers delaying delivery because they think Tesla will reduce prices to qualify for the new China tex credit? See this: [https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/y00n8b/tesla\\_forcing\\_to\\_take\\_the\\_delivery\\_before\\_2023/](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/y00n8b/tesla_forcing_to_take_the_delivery_before_2023/) Remember Tesla has been raising prices for the first half of the year. It's probable that alot of customers on Tesla's delivery waitlist in China placed orders at prices that were lower than they are today. And Tesla has yet to drop their prices. I suspect Tesla will force car buyers in China to take delivery during Q4 or take away their old reservation price - the difference of which may be more than the new China EV tax credit which is equal to just 5% (source: [https://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/3193859/electric-cars-beijing-extends-exemption-5-cent-purchase-tax](https://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/3193859/electric-cars-beijing-extends-exemption-5-cent-purchase-tax))!\n\nWill Tesla eventually cut prices in China? Maybe, probably, but only when they have to. To qualify for the China EV tax credit Tesla would need to cut prices by $5,000. So, i doubt Tesla will cut China prices as long as they have a huge local backlog or they can ship cars overseas and deliver them elsewhere at higher prices. Remember, the first delivery of Model Ys in Australi started at the end of Q2 in late July.\n\nAnother thing Mr. Black doesn't talk about is the real logistics required to deliver cars produced at a factory 7 days ago or less, and matching that with a customer in the local market. Think about - this isn't easy to do when you make 20,000 cars a week. There may not be 20,000 car buyers within a short-range distance of Tesla's factory in Shanghai to make all those deliveries in under a week. Or, there may be, but there may not be enough delivery drivers to get those cars into customer hands at a reasonable price. You can't just wave a magic wand and summon an infinite amount od semi trucks, drivers, delivery agents etc. The existing logistics can only process so many cars per day or week and ramping this process takes time.\n\nWhile Mr. Black has vast experience in the investing world and has previously held a high position in Advertising/Marketing, he has no real world experience in engineering, manufacturing, rail or shipping delivery or logistics. Yet, he would have us investors doubt Tesla's explanation for the Q3 miss. He is casting doubt on the narrative that Tesla shipped the cars overseas because expedited delivery costs to the local market were unreasonably high, with no experience in this industry, and no reason to believe Tesla is lying except for rumors that Chinese customers were waiting for price cuts.\n\nAnd btw, a Tesla employee in China denied the rumors of a price cut: [https://www.tesmanian.com/blogs/tesmanian-blog/tesla-china-says-info-of-model-y-price-cut-is-false](https://www.tesmanian.com/blogs/tesmanian-blog/tesla-china-says-info-of-model-y-price-cut-is-false) What i ask is who do you think would benefit from spreading this rumor? Hmm...\n\nIn summary, don't trust everything Mr. Black posts on Twitter. Even though he's a Tesla bull, he definitely does have an incentive to push the stock price down in the short-term and he's doing quite a remarkable job at spreading unsubstantiated FUD for which there is ample contradictory data.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDoubt anyone will see this but there it is, mr \"no incentive\" buying more shares at lower prices: [https://twitter.com/garyblack00/status/1580185590426873858](https://twitter.com/garyblack00/status/1580185590426873858)", "id": "y0q198", "created_utc": 1665435865.0, "score": 32, "upvote_ratio": 0.62, "num_comments": 83, "comments": [{"body": "Every opinion that doesn't agree with yours isn't FUD.

Tesla just increased production and deliveries from 250k in Q2 to 343k in Q3, so deliveries are way up. And presumably the amount of last mile delivery workers they need is also higher. \n\nSo you can see that it's possible they just couldn't find enough help to deliver all the vehicles in the last week of production and instead of paying ridiculous to do so, they decided just to ship the cars overseas.

I have been long $INTC as well, for a few months.  Regarding some saying it is a value trap, maybe.  But, one reason I can see for why Intel is negative cash flow this past quarter is that they had a -3.4Bil income taxes payable they noted, whereas prior quarters were 0 or positive.  They have more than enough cash on the balance sheet to pay off this tax liability, and would be positive cash flow this quarter if not accounting for next year's taxes--and even despite coming in soft on revenues.\n\nAlso, two other points worth considering is:   \n1) In addition to INTC having some vertical integration as both chip designer and manufacturer, their Foundry Services will open the door to them functioning more similarly to a company like TSMC, as they will fulfill manufacturing for other chip companies.  TSM commands a multiple 3 times higher than INTC.  And we have no idea if China might pull some games to ban TSMC from serving the US, especially after folks like NVDA talking about no longer serving Chinese customers.  \n2) INTC and AMD have historically been \"trading punches\" back and forth as each tries to out-compete the other.  AMD has been super hot since they have solidly capitalized on multi-core compute.  This, shortly after changing from an MBA/business CEO to an engineer CEO.  But, not everything can be solved through a 16 core processor on a 7nm die.  Think of all the components (including car computer chips, which typically are on a higher nm print) that we have a pent-up demand for.  Also, historically INTC chips have superior single-thread performance, so there is a need for their products.  And CEO Gelsinger is an OG Intel exec and with an engineering background.  So, may be ripe for a transition to Intel finding some dominance they lost previously.  Being backed by govt $ surely doesn't hurt as they take efforts to expand their manufacturing capability.

Over the past few years, Intel has demonstrated remarkably poor execution across multiple aspects of their business, and any investor in the company is betting on a major turn-around in how Intel has been run recently.  I am currently long AMD (and have taken a beating recently), but also have been following Intel for some time, and am thinking about taking a position.\n\nIn regards to Intel's fab business, this is not their first attempt at opening up to outside customers.  Their prior attempt resulted in some major disasters, that have mostly been brushed under the rug ($$$ changed hands).  The failure of the original 10nm process led to the destruction of LG's nascent mobile chip business, with reported 0% yields of working parts.  Other rumored customers that got burned included Cisco, Panasonic, and Altera (the FPGA designer, who they bought).  Of particular note, Intel's 10nm delays are one of the factors that ignited the current semiconductor war with China, as it ended up crippling Nokia and Ericsson's 5G rollouts -- Huawei was poised to grab a huge slice of the 5G infrastructure market, until the US government intervened to block Huawei from accessing TSMC's fab services.\n\nAside from their past failures, the Intel fab business also has the problem that they compete with many of their potential customers, and have a maybe-deserved reputation for playing dirty and ruthless (as AMD has experienced in the past).  While Samsung's fab business shares similar issues, TSMC has the advantage that they guarantee they will never compete with their customers.  Intel increasingly needs outside customers to maintain the massive economies of scale required to stay at the bleeding edge of fabs, as their own IDM volume might not be sufficient to do so, but the only way a lot of companies will work with Intel at significant scale, is if they're forced to do so (which is possible if Intel regains clear technological leadership over TSMC and Samsung, or if Taiwan's geopolitical situation deteriorates).\n\nIntel's own client and server products are increasingly under pressure from AMD, and maybe ARM as well.  Intel has been somewhat protected by market inertia and competitor supply constraints (AMD in particular has been limited in the past by the TSMC wafer supply, and while the wafer situation has resolved, more recently AMD has been limited by the supply of advanced substrates), but Intel will likely continue to experience severe pressure through 2023 and 2024.  The situation after that will depend on consistent execution by Intel.  Their Client business seems to be executing reasonably well, for now.  On the server side, the development process of Intel's much-delayed Sapphire Rapids server chip has not been encouraging.  \n\nOther recent execution failures have included Intel's aborted efforts at mobile chips and 5G modems, repeated delays to the still-unready Aurora supercomputer, and a rough launch of their recent line of discrete GPU parts.  Turning this ship around is going to take several long years, and Intel's financial situation is going to get worse before it gets better -- *if* it gets better.", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Bagholder spotted.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
