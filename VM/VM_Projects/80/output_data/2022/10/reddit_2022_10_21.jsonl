Currently China holds 65% of the worlds lithium processing and refining capacity, and 70% of rare earths capacity (for rare earths think the magnets used in electric motors and other high-tech components of the vehicle).\n\n[https://www.fdiintelligence.com/content/feature/chinese-companies-expanding-footprint-in-global-lithium-mines-81261](https://www.fdiintelligence.com/content/feature/chinese-companies-expanding-footprint-in-global-lithium-mines-81261)\n\nCompare that to the USA with 2.1% lithium and 15% rare earths.\n\nChina has 30x the lithium capacity of the United States. Is China gonna keep selling lithium and rare earths to an American company, or will they try to cripple the US economy and keep everything domestic in response?\n\nChina has lax environmental regulations which is why their mining industry is so big. For example a Canadian lithium mine went bankrupt after the Canadian government spent half a billion dollars, hurdle after bureaucratic hurdle, environmental, indigenous, etc. etc. \n\n[https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/quebec-lithium-mine-s-bankruptcy-flags-canadian-market-obstacles-analysts-say-58533815](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/quebec-lithium-mine-s-bankruptcy-flags-canadian-market-obstacles-analysts-say-58533815)\n\nThis highlights the difficulty in opening a lithium mine, its an insanely long process, which takes on average 4-7 years.\n\n[https://www.wsj.com/video/series/wsj-explains/how-lithium-became-a-hot-commodity/78BE4563-8D74-4B28-9FC7-450D5330107C?trk=public\\_post-text](https://www.wsj.com/video/series/wsj-explains/how-lithium-became-a-hot-commodity/78BE4563-8D74-4B28-9FC7-450D5330107C?trk=public_post-text)\n\nLets say theoretically everyone on the planet wanted to buy a Tesla.. Regardless of that demand, Tesla's limiting factor is currently the supply side, and can only get worse.
