I do think that one can maybe make the case in a best case scenario that we don't have a 2008-esque crisis but that the sort of ultra low interest rate environment that the market (and particularly growth) has enjoyed for the last dozen or so years might be over. \n\nThat doesn't mean the market keeps tanking, but we did have a period between 2000-2008 post dot-com where things like real assets did well, eventually you had 2008, QE and a dozen years or so where growth was the only game in town. And perhaps we're back in the 2000-2008 environment again.\n\nThat's not saying don't own any growth, but it increasingly feels like the sort of 2020 growth boom is not coming back for a very long time and anyone anticipating that happening is going to be disappointed. High quality growth that's profitable, has a strong track record and fits into an easily sold theme, great. Low quality/highly speculative thing that won't be profitable for another few years aren't going to fare well and there's a lot that went public in 2020 that increasingly feels like eventual 0's. \n\nDo we have a world where there's re-shoring and we actively try (succeed I don't know, but a lot of companies would benefit from the money spent trying) to bring industry back to (or near) the United States and become less reliant on China? Maybe. \n\nI don't think raising rates will fix inflation to the degree that is hoped and inflation may be an issue for a while. \n\nThere could definitely be issues and there's a lot of issues that might be longer-term. We have a situation where office occupancy in a number of major cities still isn't back to 2019 levels. If we go further into a recession, what does that look like for a number of major cities reliant upon office traffic and all the other businesses around the offices reliant upon them. Look at a Vornado and their stock has absolutely cratered - fantastic NYC real estate, but what if hybrid work is a longer-term theme? \n\n\"While more employees started going back into the office last month, usage rates in the U.S. are still half what they were prior to the pandemic. As of Sept. 27 the average office occupancy rate was 47 percent, according to workplace security firm Kastle Systems, compared to nearly 100 percent before Covid hit.\n\nLower demand for offices across the U.S. could wipe $453 billion off their value in the coming years, according to a study from researchers at New York University and Columbia University recently published in the National Bureau of Economic Research. The study is a working paper, and hasn\u2019t yet been peer-reviewed.\" (https://observer.com/2022/10/remote-work-could-knock-39-or-50-billion-from-the-value-of-new-york-city-offices/)\n\nThere's no real off ramp for the situation in Russia, or at least not one where things just go back to the way they were before.\n\nThere's a lot of concerns of note in the world and those don't have to mean that we're facing another 2008 imminently, but the next few years might not be great either. You have a government that can't agree on anything and really, politics could easily get worse in the coming years. \n\nSo, it's tough.
