He sees Russia as a major market for Tesla vehicles but also for the raw materials for batteries. Why do you think he\u2019s trying to play both sides asking for Ukraine to accept Russians demand of signing over the land to them. \n\nElon only cares about Elon. He is seeking complete dominance by pretending to care about humanity. Autocrats are his friend now. No democracy will play hiss bullshiit games.
