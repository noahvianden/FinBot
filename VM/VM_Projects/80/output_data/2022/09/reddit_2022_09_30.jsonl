In the comments I describe the short positions that had been building against $TSLA and $AAPL. I think a lot of you now understand why Wallstreet was gearing up for war on retail's two favorite stocks.\n\nNow I am going to tell you what their goal probably is and to summarize what the economic trends we're seeing in the consumer based on earnings reports.\n\nBuckle up, you probably want to both hear and not hear what I have to say.\n\n# Inflation -- People Are Making Decisions, \"Do I buy luxury brand or do I buy store brand?\"\n\nSo, inflation. The Big I-Word. It's been a disaster for the market. A genie that should never have been let out of the bottle, but it is and we're not done with it yet (clearly). There are a lot of signs emerging that it's affecting the consumer. While it's not affecting the net spend from consumers--yet--it is affecting their choices.\n\nTake $WMT. WMT saw a pretty good upswing in it's earnings last report with quite a good beat, but why is this? Aren't things horrible for retail stores? Well, if you think so, you'd be right. But one person's loss is another person's gain. When you're entering tough times and things are expensive you do what you have to do, you buy cheaper. You go for store brand products. Instead of shopping at your local high end Bashes grocery store or Super Target, you hit up Wal Mart, Costco, places that have their entire model built on stretching a consumer/shopper's dollar to the max.\n\nThis was our first big key to what's going on. Let's talk about the next.\n\n# The Bullwhip Effect\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[What the Books say is happening. This is how you get a glut of inventory](https://preview.redd.it/2evme75dewq91.png?width=670&format=png&auto=webp&s=f08fa1a17a7c191d0bf059cff198850d6fb56243)\n\nBullwhip Effect -- AKA Covid \"BUY IT ALL! WE'RE STUCK AT HOME!\"\n\nWe're seeing a huge bullwhip effect in the market. Places are being flooded with inventory. Yes, this is old news, but it is also current news. $TGT's last quarter was the perfect example for how this god awful situation plays out. Companies ordered a ridiculous amount during the pandemic because all of us sat at home on our phones ordering everything we ever wanted in our lives. Because stocks were so low, places started to double, triple up on their orders in order to try and meet a new high demand that they were forecasting.\n\nWell, it didn't last forever. Plus... this didn't help...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Yeah... that's your stuff out there.](https://preview.redd.it/p50gpamfewq91.png?width=2500&format=png&auto=webp&s=b835ca06f519998080f9c16d8315ad5ef5c843ae)\n\nShip Congestion. That's your stuff out there. Sitting for months.\n\nThis stuff sat on boats for freaking months. You might say, 'Hey, Tay\\_tay86, I know all this crap. Why are you telling me old news?\" Because guess what, it's here now. That stuff has been unloaded and sent to the stores.\n\nBut guess what? It's freaking late. Like really late.\n\nSo what does a company like $TGT do? Well, in their case they list on clearance. It costs money to have this crap around. Plus if it sits too long, it has to be completely written off. You know, red tag 80-90% clearance aka please get it out of my store. That gave $TGT a fat \\~45% cut in EPS because they have to eat all of their costs associated with producing and then shipping that item at stupid high prices to your fat ass. If it takes too long, they get shellacked.\n\n# Here comes out next challenger... Nike. $NKE\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Here we go again...](https://preview.redd.it/uzj64zvgewq91.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=177d873f7aa902a06d9ad318ac66bbac91030e0a)\n\nOur old friend. Mr Highly Engineered Shoes Guyz\n\n$NKE reported after the bell today. All eyes were definitely on them. They've been talking about this one all over the place so going in, it's a hot topic. Well, it's a pretty bad story.\n\nThere's a lot of similarities here. I highly encourage you to listen to their entire call.\n\nTheir margin's are compressed AF. 22% drop in profits is a pretty dire warning to unprofitable companies or ones that are barely profitable.\n\n1. Any time a CEO/CFO is throwing out catch phrases after every BAD result is a sure fire sign that they are trying to distract you from the car wreck that is their report. I Counted at least 4-5 times of 'We're still the super cool choice for shoes' (Paraphrasing, clearly)\n2. They suddenly have too much inventory. Sounds familiar? It should. That's why they are clearing out of the stock afterhours. They are forecasting a repeat of what $TGT just had. $NKE may have squeaked by at 0.93 EPS today, but the next one could be a real gut punch as they try to clear these shoes. Even worse than $TGT, they sell season specific items. This means some of this crap is probably summer oriented when we're going into fall and winter. Yeah, not a good situation. It could potentially be WORSE than what $TGT just experienced. Combine that with the drop in profits and Fx challenges, you've got a real problem.\n3. China revenue dropped. I feel like that one didn't get the highlight it deserves. The CEO kept trying to amp up that China is hungry for sports themed stuff that they sell, but yet their revenue there dropped 13%. Didn't they roll out a lot of direct to consumer options? Well apparently they aren't biting. This is a very eerie warning.\n\nWhy?\n\nWell, let's start to summarize. Hopefully you're still reading.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The Cracking Of Apple](https://preview.redd.it/uppjfyxhewq91.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b327e0f44c102a34631d00e2fd295a0f94fd33aa)\n\n# The Cracking of $AAPL\n\nWe've had MULTIPLE warnings about China's demand for our multinational in the past few weeks. Let's list them out:\n\n1. FedEx reported economic weakness in China. If anyone knows how things are going, it's the folks who are delivering stuff that businesses are selling.\n2. Nike is reporting weaker revenue from China (where their stuff is basically made)\n3. Apple is supposedly pulling back a prior manufacturing target by 5-10% due to a lack of demand in places like, you guessed it, China\n\nNow apple's debatable because there's some reports that the Max is doing fine. However, I think that's probably a bullish dream. Their mainstream model is only doing as well as the first.\n\nWhat's at fault? Honestly, probably the chips and overall market. Nothing inside the phone is dramatically different. It's a big nothing burger and there's not a lot of incentive to upgrade. If you do want to, you might as well shell out for the Max to actually get something.\n\nI believe this is going to result in **a net loss of sales because not everyone will choose to buy expensive when the mainstream model is subpar.** **The upgrade is... minor.**\n\nThis is not a homerun for Apple. Wallstreet probably feels very confident about this behind closed doors, but not in public. That's why they've been building short positions against Apple.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Closing Time](https://preview.redd.it/tje90u9kewq91.png?width=930&format=png&auto=webp&s=cbb27790f23e8301f7f07db945c1d28d76405ef5)\n\n# Closing out\n\nAlright, so let's close this baby out. I know a lot won't read this, but hey, hope you do. If you had read my last one you would have made a killing betting against $AAPL this week.\n\nSo what's the trend we're seeing?\n\n1. **There's too much stuff.**\n2. **Luxuries are not the draw they once were. Things need to be noticeably different to get the $.**\n3. **Because of inflation people (middle class) are choosing to shop at cheaper locations**\n4. **Affordability is top of mind (See CarMax which I am not covering here)**\n\nSo this is it. This is all great for the battle against inflation, but it's bad news bears for your stocks. You're looking at potentially shaky EPS results as we head into this earnings season and the next. These are not single quarter problems. Inventories can take a long time to physically move through the system.\n\nWhich brings me to what this means:\n\nWe're probably going lower in the market.\n\nWall street is coming for retail. They know from all of the data and the clear charts that retail has piled into $AAPL and $TSLA as safety. They are building short positions against it because they have better info than we do. Rumors are already leaking that $TSLA could be approaching weak deliveries for a lot of the same reasons.\n\nYou've got Price and Earnings to every P/E ratio. Price has come down a lot, but now we're going to look at E heading south. There's two ways to skin a company.\n\nLet's talk about $TSLA for a second.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Tesla Is A Cult](https://preview.redd.it/t0zal9gpewq91.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6922c2439180b2800ab212b5f72dfd1257c23637)\n\n# The Cult Of Tesla\n\n# Disclaimer\n\n1. Look, I don't hide my feelings. I greatly dislike Tesla and their CEO Elon Musk. I don't trust him. I think he manipulates the market and uses it to empty his fans pockets\n2. I think the cars are cheaply made with a lot of flaws.\n3. I don't like cultish love for a human being\n\nElon has made a mistake. That mistake? Making promises he doesn't keep. There's 1 major promise that Elon should have kept: **Making An Affordable EV.**\n\nI am not going to take you through the logic. It's up above. Read this and you'll understand why I am pointing a finger here. These cars are **EXPENSIVE** and they don't offer you a big new thing than the one you already have does. FSD COSTS EXTRA. These are **luxuries**. What do we know about luxuries? People are choosing to buy cheaper. Carmax DIRECTLY said that affordability is on people's mind for car shopping now. **Especially as interest rates soar making car financing WAY more expensive than it was a year ago.**\n\nI believe this is going to bite Elon Musk right in his lying manipulative ass. His way out, pulling a huge rabbit out of the hat. This could happen soon, or it could happen next year, but it's coming for him.\n\n**Keep in mind he's already tilted his hand calling Austin and Berlin's gigafactories cash burning machines.**\n\nJust to add, Elon Musk isn't your friend. He doesn't care about you or your memes at all. He's been the richest man on the planet. He Does Not Care About You. He Doesn't Even Live In The Same 'World' As You.\n\n# Final Words\n\nWall street is coming for Apple. Wall Street is coming for Tesla. They know you're holding it. They are two, massive, giant piggy banks sitting in a market where the bears have eaten everything else alive. Every bear is starting to turn their heads and they are looking directly at a juicy, fat, pair of piggy banks.\n\nWhen it's all done, the market is probably around 3100-3300 unless things get disorderly. I expect these two to lead us lower, because lets be honest, not much else can. These two have 'been holding the market up higher.\n\nFurther disclaimer: I have positions against AAPL and Tesla. I've been rolling them for a while. I won't share my exits, but here's proof that I am in what I say I am. I started these with 3k. Going strong so far.\n\nGood luck out there. This is not an endorsement for you to copy me. I trade very actively and move very fluidly. Contact a professional if you want real financial advice. I am an amateur and this is my own take on the market. I am not responsible for whatever you choose to do.
