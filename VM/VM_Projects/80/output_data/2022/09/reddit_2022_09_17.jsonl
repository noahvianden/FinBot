I am the one who sold those puts. I didn't sell 10, I sold 20 puts. Yes, I am still \"bag holding\" the shares as you say and I'm down more than 50%+.\n\nThat being said, no it isn't my whole net worth. I still sleep well at night. I still work my normal day job and live life as normal and can pay all my bills just fine. I still have my 2 properties and my dividend portfolio which I continue to add to during these down markets. While I agree, I may have went too heavy on the position. I still see NVDA becoming a trillion company within my lifetime (I'm only 30) and while it sucks to wait, I do have time on my side and I'm not in dire urge to use the money. \n\nIf you are thinking that I cry at night about the lost money, sure it stings but as with all investing, there are bound to be highs and lows. During the bull run, I printed roughly around $200k in profits before I was assigned so I don't see it as a loss as those gains help me get another property which is being rented out right now and giving me monthly cash flow while I'm down on this position. Overall, while I could have done things less greedily, I don't regret anything as 1) I used the gains to diversify into safer investments which are helping me now during the down markets and 2) I truly don't worry about owning the stock long term despite what all the haters may say.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Lol I thought you only sold 10, but yeah I guess I have been wanking off on that loss porn for so long I still remember almost a year later\n\nBut hey as long this loss has not financially crippled you than I guess you will be fine, it\u2019s just the opportunity costs that\u2019s tremendous \n\nAlso I posted this as a dire warning to all the ppl that praise the \u201cwheel strat\u201d, that no it\u2019s not a great strat and can lead you to huge losses", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6409612894058228}], "tickers": ["nvda"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Well, that\u2019s not me but I\u2019m amazing because I started a PMCC strat before the big collapse.
