{"title": "9-26-22 SPY/ ES Futures, Apple And Tesla Daily Market Analysis", "selftext": "What a way to start the week off! Lets set the scene here\u2026 \n\nThe last time we had 5 red days in a row was July 8th to July 14th where SPY dropped from 390.64 to 371.04. The 6th day was a huge 1.91% green day. Before that was the June CPI/ FOMC drop where we put 5 red days in a row with a drop from 415.82 to 370.59. There was one green day (fomc) of 1.43% then we had 2 more red days down to 362.17. From there we saw a bigger pop of 3 of 4 days being green and going from 362.17 to 390.09. There has not been an instance of 6 red days in a row on SPY since Feb 2020. \n\nWe have to ask ourselves are we in the same level of turmoil as Feb 2020? I would say no we are not. But we are clearly in a pretty bearish period of time in the markets. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9t02og5dj9q91.png?width=844&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f32fa0e1647668cf9ebcc2fa89479db2e6f2ecf\n\nGot a lot going on the daily chart but let me explain. I had mentioned the similarities for June 8th to June 17th on the SPY chart and this daily candle close today just made it even more similar. On June 16th we put in a candle of 370.94 to 364.08 followed be a 369.38 to 362.17 candle (that would be two back to back candles with a slightly lower high and a slightly lower low). Friday was 370.62 to 363.29 and today was 370.21 to 363.03\u2026 the exact same thing.\n\nThis to me could be a very large double bottom forming on SPY. Now only that but that June 17th low as I mentioned came after a 7 out of 8 red day stretch and SPY currently just put in its 8th red day out of the last 10 trading days. If spy is going to bounce its here\u2026 and if its not going to bounce the massive face melting dump is about to begin\u2026 Failure for SPY to make a new low for the year twice now sends a pretty big message especially with these large EOD intraday v bottoms we are seeing. Todays price action brought spy to the 75% retracement of the 2022 bear channel also. \n\nMy anticipation here after 5 red days in a row is that we are going to see a large green day tomorrow and most likely will close over 370.6 resistance. From there I would anticipate a move back to 380-390 by end of week much like we saw at the June low. \n\nKey support- 362.2 ->358.1 \n\nKey resistance- 366.5 -> 370.6\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fp6xmgmdj9q91.png?width=806&format=png&auto=webp&s=7f8e673f7db55404f408fa31c0f265cec5efedb8\n\nFutures is looking to close it lowest candle of the year currently. Currently the lowest close was on June 16that 3671.25.\n\nKey support- 3630\n\nKey resistance- 3672 -> 3708\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/075n6n6ej9q91.png?width=845&format=png&auto=webp&s=d7686a98a3bbd78e4a3b4f45fa231de3a557b071\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mujbmxqej9q91.png?width=830&format=png&auto=webp&s=8fd9e1ed029ec5e46df26853cb6a068ef72166c6\n\nThere is a pretty enormous inverse head and shoulders forming on apple daily and weekly with a current support of 149.2. Apple and overall tech today held up much better then SPY. What I am seeing which is the same as last week is that this is not a NASDAQ driven sell off. I tend to be bullish on Apple as long as it holds 149.2.\n\nKey support- 149.2 -> 147.1 \n\nKey resistance- 151.1 -> 152.4 -> 154.5\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nwx1iz6fj9q91.png?width=883&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6cc412f9f4d38e30a34bb11f05cb2fda8e3fef9\n\nQuite a bit to unpack here on the Tesla daily. I mentioned last week I forsaw after the 312 rejection a possible head and shoulders forming with a target of 222-250 (blue arrows for visual). However, looking at the smaller red arrows we actually are forming a possible bullish 270.3 support bounce with a possible target of retesting that 312 level again. \n\nIf tesla closes below 270.3 on the daily chart then I would look for the bigger sell off to play out. However, as long as we are holding support here at 270.3 there is a play on calls to 300-312.\n\nKey support- 270.3 -> 251.2\n\nKey resistance- 283.7 -> 291.6\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x2xaznofj9q91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=0be12b8322a23aecc1808ee37f29b8400c2275ff\n\nThe VIX was again on a pretty big mission today and saw a ton of intraday volatility. The one thing I am seeing here is that the VIX still has not broken that black dotted resistance line from the Jan 24 and May 2nd highs\u2026 Until that line is broken and until we see SPY break 362.17 (low of year) I am under the impression we hold support here. The VIX really has struggled to stay over 32 barely closing over it today. If the VIX breaks over 33.1 tomorrow and especially over 33.7 tomorrow I would be looking for a bigger sell off on SPY to take place. However, we may see the vix unwind and close back under 29.7 tomorrow which further points to a bigger green day tomorrow. \n\n10% challenge-\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/70yqwg7gj9q91.png?width=552&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee7f459afb6f2c20ad0026fea59a9201221f19ef\n\nOverall had a really great day today and the server as a whole had a great day! The opening hour continues to be a great trading time and the middle of the day is harder to get a good read on technical. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yhpobrqgj9q91.png?width=756&format=png&auto=webp&s=60fe38f3eba7d25f2d40ed63e47f79f49f12edba\n\nI am holding these calls. I had opened them at market open today. If my thesis holds true these will be itm tomorrow and green. I would like to close them tomorrow if possible but would consider holding till Wednesday if it looks like we are pushing. My first target for selling is the 373.44 gap fill (2.5% from close). If we make a new year low I will close these at a loss. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sedj987hj9q91.png?width=1088&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a67c5aac22dbb6ee266986f3aa95bb9aa39970f\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zpzr46ohj9q91.png?width=939&format=png&auto=webp&s=a950d6ba3627d27eb841b28802e4b9f460dffb88\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2zvksw4ij9q91.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=9674fd917f38e5342803dc843ecd88949a8caff6\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l5mv83mij9q91.png?width=988&format=png&auto=webp&s=a4fbef67e4b079aeb7370e62c46c88912ced610c\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hcw74h1jj9q91.png?width=739&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa514b7a5aa22d195b7a3d1bb29a87786bf746e0\n\nOverall pretty great day today despite the big morning reversal and high volatility. \n\nRemember when the VIX is over 30 (aka high volatility) we should be risk off here\u2026 we should be less greedy and should be careful of rogue moves up or down.
