{"title": "Tell me your opinions of me investing heavily in TQQQ in the future?", "selftext": "I want to bare bones honesty. Tell me if I am wrong to do the following: Wait for 2 consecutive weeks of stock gains once this bear market (or shall I call it a recession) is over. This could be in a quarter or in a year. Then invest heavily, as in 80% of my portfolio, into only TQQQ. If a person had done this in April 2020 (when TQQQ was at $16) and held until a couple months once the market began to go down (February 2022 and sold at $55) you would still have a nice gain. \n\nSome people out there would say price decay, which is something I do not totally understand tbh... \n\nI am more than okay with loosing almost all of my money. I am 29 and can easily make back all that I will invest in TQQQ (which would be $20k). I would cash out if/when we have a bad 6 to 7 week period. That could be in a year after investing or a decade... Let the downvotes come. Tell me why I should not do this... \n\nI see this market continuing downward, but slowly and not sharply. I see us having a good 2024 and would probably put my $20k into TQQQ over the course of a few weeks. Say we have a good 2 consecutive weeks, put in $15k. Regardless if the next 2 weeks are good or bad after that, dip in with the remaining $5k (either I buy more per share or I get a slight discount if the market should dip).", "id": "xp37uy", "created_utc": 1664244092.0, "score": 54, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 85, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 35, "replies": [{"body": "I came here to say this.

Chair Powell and team have increased it 13-fold from 0.25% to 3.25% to slay the dragon.**  \n>  \n>Under Volcker, the increase in long Treasury yields was 1.6X, from 10% to 16%, compared to 7.4X, from 0.5% to 3.7% under Powell and team. Risk aversion is pummeling all assets except cash, but the Fed seems fixated on hiking rates another 100+ basis points to protect its legacy.  \n>  \n>Meanwhile, commodity prices as measured by Refinitiv\u2019s CRB index have dropped \\~42% since their peak in mid 2008, \\~25% since their lower peak in 2011, and \\~19% since an even lower peak earlier this year.  \n>  \n>A 58% increase in the trade-weighted dollar since early 2008 helps to explain the **deflationary forces that are building** in the pipeline once again.
