{"title": "9-9-22 SPY/ ES Futures and Apple Weekly recap and Analysis", "selftext": "The bulls are back in control\u2026 or are they? \n\nLets take a look at a few things before we get into the charts and the technical. \n\nIf you follow me you know that I came into this week bearish and I was positioned with some 390p 14dte puts expecting a touch of 370-380. Now the question is why was a bearish? \n\nWell going into this week we had the attempted breakout at 430 that led to a massive sell off that led to 3 red weeks with us finally turning in a green week on SPY this week. On a technical standpoint puts made sense and calls would have been against the trend\u2026 in addition we had the CPI looming. Going into this week and going into Thursday we had no forecast and we had no consensus on CPI. With literally every single fed member, JPOW himself and heck even Biden saying \u201cinflation has not peaked\u201d with the massive sell off, the suspiciously long time we went with no CPI forecast/ consensus one would assume it was because they were going to predict inflation >8.5% (higher then previous). However, Thursday the forecast came in at 8.1% and today the consensus also came in at 8.1%. \n\nNow that we have seen CPI come in bullish, markets have accepted the fact that we most likely will be seeing a 75bps hike no matter what CPI is and markets clearly rallying despite everything JPOW re-iterated Thursday morning\u2026 and now looking at the technical with a massive V bottom rally off 390 (after consolidation) and a break through of the 405.2 level\u2026 its pretty hard to not be bullish going into next week.\n\nAfter 405.2 broke intraday today and we held it I took a loss on my then 12dte puts I have no reason to expect a reason for us to go down. Now the only reason I remotely could expect any sort of bigger sell off to break 405.2 next week would be IF CPI comes in dogwater like 9%. If CPI comes in at 8.5% or below markets are about to shrek back to 430 if not higher. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4kv3ovp6xwm91.png?width=864&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d3847b0ea297345adb8599983c311c6080d9f1b\n\nLooking at SPY daily you can see we have a very sharp and distinct V bottom using September 1st and September 7th to start the V. We have now held that support for 3 days in a row. I spoke on the fact that in the last 16 days there had only been two times that SPY had back to back green days well this is the first time since the peak at 430 that spy has put in back to back to back green days. This in my opinion is the change of tide. The bear sentiment has left the market. \n\nWe broke through that blue resistance line. This is the line using August 16th and August 26th tops. Breaking this line is saying the bear movement is over and we should be looking for the next bull run. In addition, a close back over that level resistance of 405.2 is extremely bullish especially after a failure to continue lower after breaking 390. While we could see a return back to 390 (but unlikely in current bullish sentiment and news cycle) a closure over 405.2 should lead markets to push back for a 417.3 level test. \n\nBulls managed to close this daily candle completely over the daily 8ema. Until that daily 8eam is broken we should be bullish. \n\nNow today did leave a \\~$2 gap on the daily chart that COULD be filled before we push higher. I do forsee a scenario Monday where we back fill that gap and see a little weakness going into CPI. Actually a red day Monday would give way for four green days in a row after CPI comes in positive. \n\nKey supports- 405.2 (level support) -> 402.7 -> 401.8 (V bottom recovery support) -> 400.4 (gap fill at 400.86) -> 397.8 \n\nKey resistance- 409.6 -> 412 -> 415.3 -> 417.4 (level resistance) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6h9lved7xwm91.png?width=758&format=png&auto=webp&s=06ef1280e7de67e2bacbda863a16203b9928d905\n\nLooking at SPY weekly we are have broken out of that downward channel on the weekly too. Now the one interesting thing is that SPY weekly did break through the blue June/ July recovery support line (futures and Apple also did), however, despite that being a bearish signal we rallied off of that level. \n\nI called it out earlier in the week but we are seeing a double bottom like formation at 392.2 also on the weekly and closed higher then last weeks candle which should signal upside. With a weekly close back over the daily 8ema and 100ema as long as spy holds the daily and weekly 8emas we should be bullish. \n\nKey support- 390.3\n\nKey resistance- 412.5 -> 426.1\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/amrjf5x7xwm91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa7527fb19b7fbfd22fc44dc2de49d0b11408349\n\nFutures has a similar V shaped recovery also, however, it did not break through its bear run blue resistance line as that was at 4105. While futures did close back over the daily 8ema it did fail to close over the 100ema. \n\nKey support- 4060 (v bottom support) -> 4025 -> 4008 -> 3980\n\nKey resistance- 4092 (blue resistance) -> 4128 -> 4148 -> 4200\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/31lra5i8xwm91.png?width=739&format=png&auto=webp&s=52f32bfa150d8713c893f39713f5cb61fc376bab\n\nFutures weekly did break through that blue support line as I mentioned in SPY, but with this new bounce we will make the new support recovery line. We saw the weekly also break the black bear channel too along with closing back over the 8ema and 100ema. With a level close over 4025 we will next look for 4160 and 4280.\n\nKey support- 4025 -> 3900 (blue bull support)\n\nKey resistance- 4160 -> 4280\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/40erpo09xwm91.png?width=808&format=png&auto=webp&s=11cf85d6f6dab4325067dce3bb701ce7283e5aa5\n\nI had mentioned that pretty much all week and even some of last week that Apple was looking extremely weak compared to SPY. We did not see that v bottom recovery that futures and SPY were showing form until today. With two intraweek closed below the daily 200ema that would appear to be very bearish, however, we actually saw Apple put in quite a bit of strength today. \n\nApple failed to close over its daily 8ema but we can look for that to take place next week along with pushing for that blue bear resistance from this sell off. \n\nKey support- 156.7 (v bottom support) -> 155.5 (200ema) -> 154.4\n\nKey resistance- 158 -> 160.3\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f35jp1j9xwm91.png?width=778&format=png&auto=webp&s=d1e2b74f697ccb2e88564a611cebe0a1b248160d\n\nNow Apples weekly is where things get a little peculiar when you factor in Apples daily and SPY/ the general market and sentiment shift. \n\nThe apple chart is still holding within the downward channel from the August 15th and August 22nd weekly tops. But unless Apple opens under 156.7 and holds there the remained of the week Monday will most likely open over that level. However, we are seeing a gravestone doji weekly candle closed (the opposite of what we saw the week of August 15th) and this should signal a push green next week. \n\nKey support- 154.7 (blue bull support) -> 154 -> 150.3\n\nKey resistance- 156.7 (bear resistance) -> 161.1 -> 163.5\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s4maeh3axwm91.png?width=836&format=png&auto=webp&s=c8f35581154b61494d684630ebd463a800c0d84e\n\nAs I mentioned on Thursday the VIX had broken the recovery support line and has closed its 3rd consecutive candle below 25.5 With this failure to breakout to 30 and looming bullish (aka lessened fear) of CPI and FOMC coming up we should expect to see the VIX retest the 18s and 19s soon. \n\nWhere am I at now? \n\nOverall going into next week I suspect Monday to be a red day or at a minimum a consolidation day with most like a 0.5 +/- finish. While the markets do expect CPI to be bullish I would be hesitant for the markets to close a 4th green day in a row and then have that proceeded by a good CPI and see 5 green days in a row. Crazier things have happened but after 3 pretty big green days (when you think about the last month of sell off) it would not be surprising to see small decline on Monday. A retest of 405.2 and possibly even a gap fill back to 400 could be in play. \n\nFrom there I do expect now that the forecast and consensus along with the Cleveland Fed CPI all coming in below previous CPI of 8.5% that we will get a \u201cgood\u201d CPI reading (good as in reading less than previous CPI of 8.5%). I believe this will start a rally into FOMC (the next Wednesday the 21st). From there markets will get their expected 75bps hike (remember markets don\u2019t like the unexpected so even if bearish\u2026 if its known they handle it well) and from there we see a rally through end of September into October which takes us into the next earning season. \n\nTo be honest with CPI expected (and again assuming its good) coming down, the expected 75bps hike and really no new bearish catalysts to be had (unless someone can tell me something im missing here\u2026) once CPI drops on Tuesday\u2026 there will be really little reason to not be playing calls into middle of October when we see the next earnings start. These earnings could be the only thing in my opinion that would take the market down but even there I don\u2019t expect any more massive sell offs unless a new catalyst happens. \n\nMy plan-\n\nOvernight calls (small position) 3-5 strikes OTM (going to do some research this weekend on what will be the best play) Monday night into Tuesday morning (for the CPI good reading play). \n\nI will let Tuesday of CPI shake itself out\u2026 there is a chance core CPI could come in high and we could see a sell off on that but would be unlikely as long as the actual CPI is decreasing (below 8.5%).\n\nFrom there either Tuesday night (risk on) or Wednesday night (more conservative) I would consider opening some 30-45dte calls on SPY (and possibly Apple). \n\nIf you are aggressive you could open calls on Monday and let those ride also. However, you risk here being wrong about CPI and having CPI cause a major break down. \n\nNote- I will have my FOMC post up next weekend with a trade analysis and trade plan\n\n10% challenge-\n\nOverall this was a GREAT week for me\u2026 honestly one of the better weeks I have had in a very long time. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wvghhzyaxwm91.png?width=778&format=png&auto=webp&s=be119a69e9517edf2668a9b6618d339f8284e9f7\n\nSo what did I change this week? I spoke on this a little in my last weeks TA but I went from about $1500-$2000/ entry down to about $700-$1000/ entry. I also over the last few weeks have found myself hesitating on entries. Essentially I would be watching my indicators and see the \u201cperfect\u201d setup forming and I would see what would be a great entry forming, however, I would say well don\u2019t be early\u2026. Be patient\u2026 and what I would end up doing is waiting for extra extra confirmation that the trend move I saw was actually happening. This would net me a great entry but I found I was missing such a large % gains because of this. Moves that shoulda easily been resulting in 15-25% gains were being capped at 3-5% gains because by time I was ready to enter the premiums had already priced the move in and the acceleration of the move was already done. This also resulted in many times that if I didn\u2019t immediately enter I would end up red. \n\nWith a little big more aggressiveness\u2026 really pro-activeness on entries and recognizing its okay to be wrong as long as I keep a stop loss in place (definitely stuck to my -20% stop loss all week without waver) then I found myself with a much higher win rate and a much higher pay out on the wins I did bring in. This week was a really good mental week for me (and financial week). I look forward to carrying this success and strength into the rest of the month and year. \n\nAnother thing I recognized this week and was able to adapt to was the trend. While I was holding 14dte puts most of the week I did not find myself staying biased the last 3 days. I was able to play the intraday trend while having an overall bearish trend in mind. \n\nThe one thing I could have done differently this week when I look at my 14dte puts I opened after 390 broke and after we closed below 390 was to wait for extra confirmation. I could have waited one more day (which would have definitely resulted in not entering the same puts) and saw that we closed back over 390. A little bit of patience here could have resulted in not even opening that position and that also could have allowed me to more clearly see the support that and strength that 390 was putting in. I did begin middle of the week to recognized the consolidation that was taking place between 401.4 and 390, however, I would have liked to recognize that earlier. The one thing I will say though is that when Apple is known and has been historically driving the markets\u2026 when apple is continuing to push lower and look heavily bearish despite SPYs movements, its not that out of line to expect SPY to catch up to Apples momentum. However, we saw this week that the general market (non-tech) was driving this rally. \n\nIf you look at my intraday log I did open some 30dte calls on SPY and Apple near EOD today but I did decide to close them before EOD. I was going to be pro-active and let these run after the great CPI forecast and everything but I decided that with 3 green days in a row we should expect a consolidation day and possibly even a bigger red day to fill that gap before CPI starts a potential bull run. After being too aggressive with the put swings im okay with being conservative here\u2026 and if I am correct waiting 2 more days to enter calls is not going to make a big difference. The magnitude of this next potential \u201cbear market rally\u201d could take us up near 440-450s by middle to end of October\u2026 \n\nYoutube will be up later!", "id": "xa913e", "created_utc": 1662763924.0, "score": 56, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 88, "comments": [{"body": "Tbh man, your read outs are about the only reason I'm still on reddit.
