Investors widely expect a third consecutive increase of 75 basis points to bring the fed funds rate to a range of 3% to 3.25%. But investors also see a 20% probability the Fed would vote for an increase of 100 basis points, or 1 percentage point, according to the CME FedWatch tool.\n\nFull article: [https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/federal-reserve-rate-hike-100-basis-points-outlook-markets-powell-2022-9](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/federal-reserve-rate-hike-100-basis-points-outlook-markets-powell-2022-9)\n\nCFRA research says it's likely that the Fed won't raise interest rates by 100 basis points this week to avoid unnerving already anxious markets.
