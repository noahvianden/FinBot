{"title": "Which one would you buy the dip? $NVDA VS $AMD", "selftext": "Who\u2019s better? $NVDA VS $AMD\n\n$NVDA and $AMD stocks are down 60% in the last year. Is it a good time to invest or too dangerous?\n\n$NVDA started off making chips for video games and now is leading with high-performance GPUs for PC gaming, augmented virtualization, and data centers. Also, getting into new projects with their AI, powering the metaverse, creating EARTH 2 (helping predict climate change), data centers, and simulators in the AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES industry (with clients from $MBG.DEDE to $NIO).\n\n$AMD similar to $NVDA is a semiconductor company that operated in the computing and graphics segments. Some of $AMD's main projects are, Google Cloud Confidential Computing, advancing data centers, discoveries on mars, and the advance of AI getting into smart homes and autonomous vehicles. Also, $AMD recently acquired Xilinx to tap the high-performance and adaptive computing opportunity.\n\nAt the height of the pandemic, semiconductors stocks witnessed a high demand and growth, with everyone upgrading the devices while staying at home, making three years of sales in two.\n\nNow worldwide PC shipments reported their steepest-ever decline of 19.5% year-over-year in the third quarter. Europe, the Middle East, and Africa reported the sharpest dip of 26.4%.\n\nMany businesses lowered their technology spending due to geopolitical and economic uncertainties.\n\nWhich one would you buy the dip?\n\n* $AMD has a market cap of 104B and $16.434B revenue with a Revenue YoY Quarterly Growth of 29%.\n* $NVDA has a market cap of 400B and $26.914B revenue with a Revenue YoY Quarterly Growth of 16.5%\n* Debt/ Equity ratio of $NVDA is 0.492 compared to $AMD 0.053\n* Price to FCF of $AMD 27.635, $NVDA is 83.393\n* $NVDA P/S is 14.066 compared to $AMD 4.139\n\n$AMD like $NVDA has a lot of similarities and will probably benefit a lot from its work with open AI and autonomous vehicles. $NVDA has an advantage in GPUs for PC gaming but $AMD has a diverse product portfolio of CPU, SoC, FPGA, and GPU.\n\nLooking at its financials, projects, and company history I would invest in $AMD.\n\nWhat would you invest in?\n\nMY PORTFOLIO- [https://www.jika.io/u/Crowman](https://www.jika.io/u/Crowman?re=reddit)", "id": "zrkv2i", "created_utc": 1671627506.0, "score": 41, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 85, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|0|**First Seen In WSB**|4 weeks ago\n**Total Comments**|2|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 month|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\n ^^[**Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse) ^^[BanBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/banbets/)  ^^VoteBot ^^[FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/votebot/) ^^[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/leaderboard/) ^^- ^^[**Keep_VM_Alive**](https://www.patreon.com/visualmod)\n>TL;DR: I would invest in $AMD over $NVDA because it is cheaper and has a more diverse product portfolio.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Intc", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["intc"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["amd", "nvda"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 55, "replies": [{"body": "I got some juicy PUTS on Nvidia, let's see if they will print soon or later", "score": 5, "replies": [], "tickers": ["nvda"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "> By the way, NVDA didn't go up merely because people started working at home, their sales were heavily influenced by Crypto miners.\n\nAccording to NVIDIA, their sales of crypto mining processors was down close to 80% this year.
