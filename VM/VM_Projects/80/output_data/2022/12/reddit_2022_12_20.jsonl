{"title": "Common misconceptions: Quality issues, lack of colors, outdated designs, price increases, slow to introduce models, long wait time, expensive, not enough range, better alternatives coming.", "selftext": "These are all the stuff people complain about when they respond to any Tesla or Elon related posts.  First of all, I think Elon needs to stfu for the sake of TSLA investors and salvage his reputation and I get why there are so many haters.  However, the cars are some of the best cars one can own.\n\nI made a list of the most common complaints that people have about Teslas and EVs and why they\u2019re wrong.  I owned/leased multiple cars in my life and the M3SR+ and MYP are some of the best cars I\u2019ve ever owned.  Are these cars for everyone?  No.  Each person has their preferences and I can\u2019t speak for everyone but I do want to point out the most common misconceptions I see every day.\n\n\nHere\u2019s my take: \n\nQuality issues -  when new models come out there are definitely quality issues, especially during the end of quarter rush.   Quality has gotten way better and most \u201cpanel gaps\u201d can be corrected upon picking up your car or with 1-2 stops at the service center.  It\u2019s really not that big of a deal with much better it is compared to other ICEs and EVs. \n\nLack of color options - they offer a few colors to help them scale their production.  You can always wrap your car for $2000-2500 if you love the attention and feel the need to stand out.\n\nOutdated designs - the model S and X have been around for a while and people who know Teslas can tell the subtle difference between the older and newer models.  I personally like it and as a owner of the car would prefer not to fall into the update cycle every 4-6 years that make you feel like your car is outdated.\n\nPrice increases - in the last two years everything got more expensive.  Tesla raised prices to maximize profit and to accommodate the rising material cost.  It sucks that some of us didn\u2019t get to buy a $50k model Y, an $80k model S, or a $100k model X.  Prices are where they are today and everyone pays the same price.  In the last two years almost all auto makers raised prices, on top of that dealerships would mark up cars however they like and then try to get you with their financing and extended warranty.   Nowadays I\u2019m still seeing people comparing sticker prices without considering the dealer markup.\n\nSlow to introduce new models - Tesla doesn\u2019t need to introduce a cheaper model while they are still selling all the cars they can make.  At some point they will be pressured to make a smaller and cheaper model, but an entry level model at $47k with a $7k rebate is pretty reasonable.  A new Prius (slick looking) is $32k but it\u2019s a hybrid after all.\n\nLong wait time - not so long now and will continue to decrease as production increases.\n\nExpensive - for everything such as over the air updates and improvements, saving time from going to the gas station, virtually no maintenance, and cost of gas, it\u2019s really not that expensive.  All teslas come with an awesome panoramic roof, sensors all around, and sentry mode.  Also, the built in GPS makes it a very poor candidate for thieves.\n\nNot enough range - I\u2019ve had two Teslas in 3 years and I\u2019ve used the supercharger 5 times.  It seems like everyone replying to Tesla and EV related posts are driving 300 miles a day.  If that\u2019s the case getting an EV will save them a ton of money on gas and wear and tear.\n\nBetter alternatives coming - yah they are getting better. If you like other EVs go for it.\n\nDid I leave anything out?\n\n\nEdit:   If you don\u2019t mind please share the following:\n\n1.  If you own a Tesla, an EV, or something else:\n \nI\u2019ve had a 2018 Model 3 and have a 2022 Model Y.\n\n2.  Are you a TSLA bill, bear, or don\u2019t care?\n\nI\u2019m bullish on Tesla in the long run.\n\n3.  Where you are getting your information.\n\nMy opinion come from owning the cars for several years and have a lot of friends who also drive and enjoy their Tesla/EV ownership.\n\n4.

Ford had to halt production of the Mach E because they were actually losing money on each car sold due to part price increases.

The only caveat to that may be the 100k+ Porsche/Mercedes models, but those are sold in very low numbers.   Rivian is still hand building cars, and the ramp up is never going to happen.
