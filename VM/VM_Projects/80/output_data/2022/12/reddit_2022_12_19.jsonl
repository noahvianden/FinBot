I'm not parroting anything. This is stock investing...wheel strategy involved researching stocks, getting paid premiums for essentially putting in limit orders (just like if you were long stocks outright instead of options).

If you get assigned, you can rack up more gains through cap gains then more premiums from selling covered calls when you want to sell.\n\nWith your example of AMZN...if I'm a stock investor, not an options trader, and I buy AMZN outright at $100 then the stock tanks, the only difference with the wheel strategy is that at least I got paid premiums to buy the stock at $100. \n\nAt the end of the day stock investing is about finding good companies to invest in. You can either buy shares outright for no premium or sell options at price points you're comfortable buying a good stock at. \n\nYour argument makes no sense. And don't try to throw out strawman arguments by saying I'm arguing you can't lose money with the wheel strategy because that's not at all my point.

If it drops to a certain price then my purchase will go through and if it rises to a certain point my sell will go through.\n\nI've been assigned on stocks while wheeling and I let the stock ride for a while before putting in a covered call.\n\nIf you're long on a stock you need to sell at some point as well.

The stock ends up dropping all the way to $35 in a massive sell-off...well my limit order would trigger as soon as the price hit $45, so I'd buy the shares at $45 and they'd continue to fall down to $35.\n\nIn a parallel universe, I decided to sell puts on the same stock at a strike price of $45. Same thing - the stock sells off to $35 by the end of the week, so I end up getting assigned at $45 with the shares only being worth $35.\n\nWhat's the difference in these two scenarios?? In the options scenario I got paid premiums and in the limit order scenario I didn't. Unrealized losses are the same in both scenarios. My cost basis in the same in both scenarios.\n\nOn your other point that you don't need to ever sell stocks if you're long...that's incorrect. The purpose of owning a stock is to sell it at some point in the future so you can cash own. Owning a stock literally forever is a literal waste of money (unless you're collecting dividends) because that would mean you bought something and literally never received anything in return. You HAVE to sell at some point if you want to actually get something out of it. Obviously in the wheel strategy most people typically sell CCs and try to get out of their assignments relatively quickly, but you absolutely do not need to especially if your research makes you believe the stock will take off at some point soon, so the cap gains would outweigh any sort of CC premium...so you can just sit on it, then when the price gets high enough you can sell a CC to collect premium AND cash out in the cap gains you racked up", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "We're going around in circles, but I'll do this one last time.\n\nIn your scenarios above, you're not keeping the strategy mindsets the same between options and buying shares outright. \n\nCC: the scenario you laid out is EXACTLY the same as if I bought the shares outright, decided that $55 was a good price to sell, so I sell, but then the stock keeps going up. The only difference is that I got no premiums for selling them at $55. If I felt strongly that the stock would keep going up beyond $55, I wouldn't sell a CC that low...I would just hold my shares (i.e. keep my cash invested in the shares) until the price rose high enough for me to share. In your scenario you're implying that if you buy shares of a stock, you'll magically know when the top of a stock will be and you'll just wait until then to sell. And if you're implying that you think the shares will go up perpetually, then in the options scenario after getting my CSP assigned, I'd just hold the shares forever as they rose forever. \n\nOn the CSP side, you ask what I'd do with my shares after the stock dropped to $35...the answer? EXACTLY WHAT I'D DO IF I BOUGHT THE SHARES OUTRIGHT! (which is likely to just hold the stock, trusting my research, and waiting for the stock to go up). That's what you're missing here. In your two theoretical scenarios you're giving the buy and hold theoretical person godlike knowledge, then give the options theoretical person no brain. The two theoretical people here have the SAME brain. If they both think the stock will go up to a certain price, then BOTH will wait to sell until it hits that price...except the options person will get premiums for selling their CC at the same price the long investor sells their shares outright at. \n\nI think the issue here is that you don't fully understand how the wheel strategy works. You seem to feel that in the wheel strategy, if you get assigned shares you're required to dump them immediately. I'm sure there are some traders that do this, but you aren't required to (especially because that's usually dumb), JUST LIKE some supposed buy and hold investors buy a stock, then get spooked if it tanks, so they sell at a loss and buy something else.\n\nMy whole point is that the wheel strategy can effectively be the same as a long investor except that the wheel strategy earns you premiums.
