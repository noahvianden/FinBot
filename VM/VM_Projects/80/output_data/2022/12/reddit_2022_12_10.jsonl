{"title": "Why December Could be a Bloodbath: Limited Upside, Volatile Downside", "selftext": "Clickbait title, I know.\n\nThis is my own perspective, though gathered from the insights of more knowledgeable people than me, of the most important aspects of the current market setup and what I see as the immediate risks and likely outcomes from now into January. \n\n**The tl;dr** of this is that through the end of the year there is much greater risk to the downside than there is to the upside. For the bulls, it's entirely possible we see some good data and a Fed announcement that is *dovishly-interpreted* and we levitate higher into the new year. *However*, I as I go over below, I think the *probability* that outcome will follow through is small, and the current conditions - low liquidity, likely bear rally top, news/data catalysts - actually yield a higher probability of *downside* to the current levels, a scenario similar to December 2018, which some folks might remember. \n\n**What should you do?** I don't believe this means you need to sell everything and get short. The market could very easily stay flat into the new year and then volatility increases. I would suggest to bulls to be careful about positioning and assume that your upside is capped at 5-10% while your downside is more like 10-20%, and the probabilities sway to the downside. Reduce your long risk.   \nFor bears, this is an interesting point to take a shot at a large drawdown, but that might not play itself out overnight, so just buying weekly puts 10% out of the money on Monday is probably not a good strategy. \n\n**For myself,** I'm the most short I've been in a long time and will be considering to add more on Monday. \n\n# The Setup\n\nI believe the recent rally has been just another bear market rally and we recently topped around SPY 410, just above the downward-sloping 200DMA. There are two very simple reasons I believe that:\n\n**First,** **small caps and risk-on have not participated in the rally.** The image below shows the performance of IWM (small caps) vs the SPY, and we can see IWM have really not outperformed in this rally, which is something you'd expect to see if we were truly coming out of a bear market. I'm looking for things like IWM, XHB (homebuilders), XLY (consumer discretionary), and XBI to lead us into a new bear market, and while these things look to be bottoming, they are going sideways right now.   \nThat's *not* risk-on, and in fact the leaders of this recent rally have mostly been \"defensives\" - XLF, XLI, XLU, DJI, TLT (bonds) - people are worried about a recession. And actually, if you look at some of those leaders now, they look topped-out and a bit vulnerable.\n\n[IWM \\/ SPY](https://preview.redd.it/xqgbio87x45a1.png?width=2474&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4cf1a85fe87a6eb5a9fbb87f75b5c68d3aa2c2a)\n\n**Second,** assessing this as another bear market rally, **we probably topped around 410 which approximately corresponded with a recent low in the VIX.** A pattern this year has been when the VIX gets around 20 that's marked the top of a rally and when it gets to around 30-35 that's marked the bottom of a sell-off, and I think we've just had another one of these:\n\n[VIX \\/ SPY, sell at blue and buy at green](https://preview.redd.it/3q1chjt3y45a1.png?width=2474&format=png&auto=webp&s=afbc24e70b2f0c5bf8bba21b6569c295b4afb386)\n\nIn addition to these technical and internal signals, we're facing a possible liquidity drain going into the end of the year. *Liquidity drain* basically means there will be less available cash in the markets to support price action.   \nI think this because of a few reasons:\n\n**First,** **the Treasury** [**intends to boost its General Account to around 700 billion by the end of the year**](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1063) **from about 430 billion now.** This means it needs to sell treasuries to raise cash, effectively removing dollars (and liquidity) from the financial system. There's some interesting opinions about how the Treasury has been drawing down this account recently possibly in counter-action of QT, but I digress. It is a liquidity drain nonetheless. \n\n[Treasury GA Balance](https://preview.redd.it/q4iujtei055a1.png?width=1171&format=png&auto=webp&s=afc436833b39614bf56b61d5117e2437004a7111)\n\n**Second, seasonality**. We're in a light trading period, stuff like 401k distributions and tax-loss harvesting may or may not have an impact, and it's possible we see a spike in Reverse Repos like we do last year, another liquidity drain.\n\n[Reverse Repo Balances, Nov 2021-Now](https://preview.redd.it/qse2y3ym055a1.png?width=2474&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae9e9c5e68020d013af845f0b2a39adf914c7944)\n\n# The Catalysts\n\nNext week has CPI data Tuesday, FOMC announcement Wednesday, and some interesting economic data on Thursday. With all of this important news, it seems highly likely to me we'll see some big moves next week. \n\n**CPI is a \"noisy\" dataset.** We can see this just going through the data this year - inflation has shifted around to different parts of the economy from energy to goods to services. This is typical of inflation trends we've seen previously, and it's also typical that inflation will trend down for several months only to flare up again, and sometimes over a several year period. There is much debate over what's caused this inflation and how it might be the kind to go quickly away, but historical evidence tends to disagree.   \n**But what this means is that it's** ***possible*** **we see a hot or sticky CPI print next week**, and I think it's *probable* we do, for three reasons. I'll caveat the following that I wasn't able to find a solid news reference for these, but they have been talked about on major news outlets. First, we had a hot PPI number last week, and along with that data came upward revisions to the PPI numbers reported in the previous two months. Meaning producers are still increasing prices. The second is that we've also seen revisions *higher* to recent month's wage growth data, continuing to show a strong labor market and worker. The last, and possibly most important, is that the October CPI (reported in November) came in light seemingly because of some kind of one-off adjustment to health care insurance reporting. \n\nI think all of these together increase the risk of a surprise *higher* in the CPI data.\n\n**The Fed.** The Fed will raise 50bps and that's expected, but the market will be looking to the dot plot for 2023 - the Fed's expectations for rates through 2023. As of now, the market is in some disagreement with Eurodollar futures pricing <4.5% funds rate by September 2023, while Fed governors have recently been jawboning about a 5% + funds rate to *stay in place* through the end of 2023. There's a disconnect there and that could shock the market a bit here.\n\n[Eurodollar Futures Curve](https://preview.redd.it/n87emjm2755a1.png?width=656&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb5872ae24b77293e15d84be6f68a26bd9c9a0e5)\n\n# Wrapping Up\n\nI think this combination of low liquidity + recent bear rally top + news catalysts create an environment where we have much more downside risk than upside. Bulls need some things to really go their way, and even then it's hard to see anything but a levitation a few percent higher into January, while any piece of bad news could cause some big volatility to the downside. \n\nI'll also make a comment here that there seems to be a narrative forming that we'll have some kind of Santa rally and then start crashing in January/February. I think that's too convenient and people are ignoring the dangers immediately in front of us.\n\nI'm very bearish for Q1 2023 for reasons I won't get into here, but I've also started viewing this next week as a possible catalyst for the next downside move. If it doesn't happen, that's fine - I'm positioned accordingly as I think it will eventually happen in Q1, but in the last week I've moved my long-term long-only holdings into mostly cash and treasuries, just in case things start to get crazy sooner than people think.", "id": "zi51ir", "created_utc": 1670709844.0, "score": 101, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 81, "comments": [{"body": "Bears know all this and bulls won't listen.", "score": 26, "replies": [{"body": "You mess with the bulls and you get the nuggies", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4852830767631531}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2942085862159729}, {"body": "I am going to buy 10% otm weeklies and you can't stop me", "score": 15, "replies": [{"body": "![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.06334878504276276}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.37946033477783203}, {"body": "Market gonna red as nose of Rudolf", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Or Red like Santa coat", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Maybe in the end it\u2019s black like charcoal", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "White as Christmas snow.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Pink like your girlfriends pu$$y", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.13733316957950592}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.0863330289721489}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.04278185963630676}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.13542740046977997}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.13542740046977997}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.13351932168006897}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.35125264525413513}, {"body": "Already seeing 0% APR for 36 months on cars\u2026demand is no longer.
