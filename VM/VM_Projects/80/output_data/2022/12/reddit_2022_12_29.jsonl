September 13 - S&P 500 down 4.3%**\n\nThe stock market had its worst day of the year after the August consumer price index report showed inflation running hotter than expected, at 8.3% year-over-year compared to expectations of 8.0%.\n\n  **2. May 18 - S&P 500 down 4.0%** \n\nA big earnings miss from Target highlighted shifts in consumer spending patterns, supply chain issues, and rising input costs. This was just one day after Walmart warned investors about the same issues. Target closed down 25% that day.\n\n**3. June 13 - S&P 500 down 3.9%**\n\nThe May CPI report showed inflation running hotter than expected, at 8.6% year-over-year compared to expectations of 8.3%. This day threw the S&P 500 into bear market territory for the first time in 2022, with the index down 21.8% from its January 3 highs.\n\n**4. April 29 - S&P 500 down 3.6%**\n\nA big first-quarter earnings miss from Amazon, combined with reduced guidance, sent the market reeling and pushed Amazon stock down 14%, its worst one-day decline since 2006. The sell-off sent other mega-cap tech stocks spiraling downwards as well.\n\n**5. May 5 - S&P 500 down 3.6%**\n\nThe stock market reversed sharply lower, giving back the prior day's massive gain that was sparked by Fed Chair Jerome Powell's remark that policymakers weren't considering interest rate hikes of more than 50 basis points. The Fed would go on to raise interest rates by 75 basis points just six weeks later as inflation was still running hot.", "id": "zyh93x", "created_utc": 1672349825.0, "score": 713, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 79, "comments": [{"body": "This is Stupid Match.
