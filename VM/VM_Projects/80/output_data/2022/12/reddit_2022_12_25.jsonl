{"title": "META Trade Analysis - How I Survived a -40% Drop in Price", "selftext": "Hello Traders,\n\n\\- This is an educational post, primarily for beginners/intermediate traders, showing the strategy I use.\n\n\\- Here is an analysis of my META trade where I managed to still profit 14% even after price fell -40%. I wanted to make this post as an example of how to maneuver through Bear markets and still come out on top.\n\n\\- It's rare that I get in a trade that drops this much, but that's why I choose to use META as an example of why this strategy is so effective.\n\n\\- This is the basic strategy I use; I find oversold/overbought stocks and enter at key levels. I average down at key technical support levels if price continues to fall, that way I keep my average price close to the current price so that when the stock does bounce I'm in profit sooner. (Strategy Simplified)\n\n\\- META is a prime example of why I always start with a 1% position... This just goes to show why risk management is so important, when you have a solid risk management strategy you can still survive a -40% drop, average down and still only have maybe 5% of your portfolio invested in that position.\n\nHopefully you can see the chart okay, I know it's crowded (did the best I could)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v5mkbgdyd08a1.png?width=1354&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e766e239b8121b8c41428d56870126d1b77c0bb", "id": "zuugwq", "created_utc": 1671958935.0, "score": 68, "upvote_ratio": 0.73, "num_comments": 82, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|0|**First Seen In WSB**|4 days ago\n**Total Comments**|10|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|3 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\n ^^[**Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse) ^^[BanBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/banbets/)  ^^VoteBot ^^[FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/votebot/) ^^[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/leaderboard/) ^^- ^^[**Keep_VM_Alive**](https://www.patreon.com/visualmod)\n>TL;DR: \\- Use technical analysis to find oversold/overbought stocks, enter at key levels.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6195553541183472}, {"body": "Now Give it a go with Tesla opportunity of life time for catching the knife", "score": 50, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "So in the end you just buy more to get a better average?
