Even then it would probably just be transient. \n\nMaybe they charge annual fees for open accounts depending on size, access, etc. Would people stay?\n\nSell stock and bonds?\n\nI really really really want to short COIN, but feel like it could go any direction at this point.\n\nEdit: Sitting on ~$5B in cash/equivalents and burned ~$2B in past 9mo based on last 10Q. At some point, they'll need to deeply cut costs, seek additional financing, or update their business model. I need to do more DD, I know, but this, interest rates going up, risk tolerance going down, and ppl sitting on assets they refuse to sell got me curious. Most of their revenue comes from retail transactions as well and with consumer debit skyrocketing, I'm assuming people will play casino less.

This is directly from the last shareholder letter for the Nov quarters earnings release :\n\n\"Before diving into the chapters, let\u2019s start with a summary of our Q3 results. Q3 results were \r\nlargely consistent with the outlook we provided in August. Q3 transaction revenue was $366 \r\nmillion, down 44% compared to Q2, driven by lower trading volume. Subscription and services \r\nrevenue increased 43% sequentially to $211 million, driven by higher interest income. Q3 net \r\nrevenue was $576 million, down 28% compared to Q2. Total operating expenses were $1.1 billion, \r\ndown 38% compared to Q2. Absent non-cash impairment charges incurred, total operating \r\nexpenses would have declined 22% sequentially in Q3. While revenues declined sequentially, net \r\nloss and Adjusted EBITDA both improved sequentially to negative $545 million and negative $116 \r\nmillion, respectively. \n\r\nHeadwinds continued to impact our transaction revenue\"\n\n\n\n\" For 2022, we remain cautiously optimistic that we will operate within the $500 million Adjusted EBITDA loss guardrail that we previously communicated. This \r\nassumes that crypto market capitalization and volatility do not deteriorate meaningfully below October levels and that we do not see changes in customer behaviors. For 2023, we\u2019re preparing with a conservative bias and assuming that the current macroeconomic headwinds will persist and possibly intensify.\"\n\n\"We ended Q3 with $5.6 billion in \r\ntotal $USD resources, in addition to $483 million in crypto assets, which we believe puts us in a \r\nstrong position to manage through the crypto winter.\r\nQ3 2022 1\"\n\nhttps://s27.q4cdn.com/397450999/files/doc_financials/2022/q3/Q32022-Shareholder-Letter.pdf", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Turns out crypto is only 9% of their balance sheet.
