{"title": "An actual Tesla valuation", "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nThe post about Tesla from yesterday convinced me to give it a go and find out whether the current price is somewhat justifiable or not (I\u2019ve actually already valued the stock more than a year ago but this time I\u2019ll be trying to better put myself in the Tesla stock buyer's shoes).\n\nThe reasoning below is obviously not meant as financial advice, its only purpose is to lay the groundwork for a fruitful exchange of views. If you don't agree with something, please feel free to bring your criticism to the table and express your thoughts!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**How many cars will be sold globally in 2030?**\n\nIf we grow the 2021 figure representing the global car sales by its historic CAGR (about 2%), the forecasted amount of cars sold globally in 2030 would be 69,315,369.\n\nNow, as far as BEV is concerned, the most optimistic CAGR estimate I was able to find online is 30%. If we grow the current BEV sales figure by 30%, we get to a whopping 42,417,997 of pure electric vehicles sold in 2030. 61% of drivers all around the world will be cruising around in a BEV (and if we were also including HEVs and PHEVs in the calculation that percentage would be even higher).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Based on the above forecasts, how much will Tesla be worth in 2030?**\n\nTesla market share is not really growing as of now but let\u2019s assume the company will eventually manage to get to a 25% total market share (also meaning a 40% EV market share) in 2030. According to these premises, Tesla would sell 17,328,842 vehicles in 2030, a CAGR of about 34% based on the current 2021 figure.\n\nWe now have a growth rate and all necessary data to use for our valuation of Tesla. In order to start with the valuation though, there are 2 more assumptions to make: Tesla will be able to maintain a profit margin of about 10% and keep selling cars for a MSRP of $40k.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The actual Tesla valuation**\n\n* Earnings for year #1: $3,468 billions;\n* Growth rate from year #1 to year #10: 34%,\n* Terminal Multiple (in this case, the PE ratio at the end of year #10): 50;\n* Discount rate (in other words, the expected annualized ROI): 12.5%.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Conclusions**\n\nIf we were to invest at the current price and with no margin of safety at all, the annualized ROI would be 12.5%. Besides the fact that 12.5% is rather low for someone picking individual stocks and trying to beat the market, that figure is the result of the most, optimistic, projections.\n\nBelow is the list of the main assumptions we made that must be met in order to get an annualize ROI of 12.5%:\n\n1. BEV market will grow by a CAGR of 30% over the next decade;\n2. More than 61% of all cars sold globally in 2030 will be BEV, HEV or PHEV;\n3. Tesla total market share will grow to 25% (this also implies that all other car manufacturers will eventually lose a significant chunk of their share and never recover);\n4. Tesla will grow at a CAGR of 34% over the whole next decade;\n5. Tesla will maintain a profit margin of about 10% over the whole next decade;\n6. Tesla will continue to sell cars for a MSRP of $40k;\n7. At the end of 2030, Tesla will still sell at a PE ratio of 50.\n\nAll this does not mean that Tesla won't be able to deliver as expected, it means that the downside, shouldn't it be able to do so, is huge.", "id": "sfgnde", "created_utc": 1643457279.0, "score": 9, "upvote_ratio": 0.61, "num_comments": 82, "comments": [{"body": "It\u2019s all bs.

It implies that not only Tesla but all automotive companies have a big challenge ahead of them. We are headed into a sharing economy and the number of people owning personal vehicles, is going to decline. A testament to see this, would be to analyse what happens to transportation as cities grow. You have fewer parking spots, real estate gets pricey (cost of storing a car goes up), the roads get congested, and hence we could see governments disincentivising owning personal vehicles. And to expect Tesla to capture 25% of the global market under these conditions? Given that a large majority of the EV sales would be happening in middle to low income countries, where a common simply cannot afford a Tesla. \n\nAll of the above assumes the fact that Tesla can keep producing batteries at the rate at which you expect, which again would be against the direction a lot of countries are moving in.

I will address the automotive side.  I don't know how fast EV will grow; but I know many people can't afford it.  Who is buying EV now?  USA, EU, China.  What do all those have in common?  They all provide some sort of subsidy.  Germany is \u20ac9K, France is \u20ac6K, Norway is no VAT of 25%: for a \u20ac50K car it would be about ~~\u20ac10K~~ \u20ac12.5K.  I don't know if these countries will subsidize forever.  China: 2022 will be the last year of subsidies.  2023 will tell the story better for china: we will see if there is going to be a lot of growth.   we don't see much EV in countries without subsidies (ie. chile, kazakhstan, greece, etc.).

The prospect of no maintenance or little maintenance vehicles isn't coming true (look at rich rebuilds youtube for deep Info), and other market participants will actually get into the game including formidable qa/qc builders like toyota before 2030.\n\nAlso, battery tech and infastructure.  The amount of infastructure upgrades to do anything other then generator supplied charging stations is enormous.  That work is _not_ on track.  EVs are great prospects for two car households with a minimum of 200 amp service.  Solid state batteries could flip this and whomever controls that tech is the one that wins.\n\nCan tesla pull it off, I hope so.

Tesla has been working on Dry Battery Electrode technology (as a part of their Maxwell acquisition) and if that delivers for them, the their capex for making cells drops dramatically lower than everyone else. They won\u2019t have to install the massive cathode baking ovens for depositing the cathode material onto the foil and baked out the solvents. The energy savings and therefore the ongoing cost savings from eliminating that step saves a lot of money. It means they can achieve their projected 3 TWh of cell production by 2030.\n\nAs it stands today, Tesla has the best margins for long range battery electric vehicles. Legacy automakers are going to be replacing their most profitable models (luxury and premium vehicles) much lower margin (and for many right now, negative margin) vehicles. Due to the inflationary environment and demand and supply imbalance, Tesla vehicles are priced high. But they have the most room to maneuver and can easily put a price squeeze on legacy automakers in a lower pricing environment.\n\nTesla has some of the highest energy efficiency in their engineering and design, which allows them to use less cells, which lowers cost and increases volume given a certain amount of cell supply. It also means they better leverage the lower energy density LFP battery cells which has no cobalt and less resource constraints.\n\nWith just the EV transition only, it isn\u2019t hard to see how hard this decade will be for legacy automakers. They don\u2019t have the cell supply. The cells they do get are of higher cost. The major volume of cells is of lower performance. And the products they go into suffer for it\u2026 more cells per vehicle to achieve range means more weight and more cost while their premium vehicle margins suffer dramatically. Furthermore, the number of total vehicle sales in the top 20 economies is likely to drop. Unit growth is coming from emerging economies with razor thin margins. Which means overall revenue declines and margin declines. Many will have to merge or die. Some will just buy out a new brand and discard their legacy ICE parts.. for example, one could see a future where Ford essentially kills most of itself by selling off non-EV parts and merging with Rivian. Then Rivian is the new Ford, carrying both nameplates.\n\nIn that case, Tesla\u2019s market share numbers will depend on cell supply which means they will likely be in the 30-40% range depending on how the shake ups happen. \n\nBut out of that 3 TWh of cell supply, stationary storage is expected to be half of that. Today, they don\u2019t make as much money there because the current cell and chip constraints means they keep robbing Tesla Energy of cell and chip supply in favor of their automotive side. I expect they gradually hit a point  where they are 50-50 in terms of cell supply.\n\nThen the next big part of the existing puzzle is automation. If Tesla\u2019s FSD does end up achieving autonomous driving, then all these dynamics are amplified many times over. The company with the ability to field the most robotaxis and monetize per mile versus by vehicle sale will make the most money. That amount is staggering on a global basis.\n\nThis past ER, they said they will start to deliver their first Model Y\u2019s built with DBE 4680 structural battery packs soon. They are being built now and going through qualifications. They have a pilot 10 GWh plant in Fremont, CA which will supply the\ninitial cells. You can see their Austin 4680 DBE cell plant being constructed, which likely will be 100 GWh of high nickel cell supply shortly. Between their new Austin and Berlin cell plants, their existing cell supply JV with Panasonic in Nevada and their contracted cell supply from Panasonic in Japan, as well as their cell supply from CATL and LG in China, they probably will be near 40-50% of global cell supply in the near future. There is a competition of capex in addition to the technology and Tesla is willing to take cell supply from anyone that qualifies which bites into other automaker\u2019s ability to obtain cells. If you don\u2019t follow the cell supply scenarios for each of the automakers, you are blind to what is going to happen this decade.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla", "ups"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Why are you assuming Tesla should get a terminal 50x P/E when the 10yr yield is 1.8%?
