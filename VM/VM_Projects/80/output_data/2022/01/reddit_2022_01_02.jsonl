We are talking about max \u20ac 20k in loans i.e ~ 1000 euro loan per month for 2 years.\n3. I will only have to start paying back monthly payment two years after I stop lending or graduation. Therefore, I would be 4 years in the stock market before I even have to start paying back. \n4. The inflation at my current country is 5,4% i.e. the inflation alone will eat away my debt.\n5) The monthly payments could be between 90-250 euros\n6) I already have ~20k debt in student loans\n7) I could always pay it back if I really have too. Only way I could get fucked is if the market will crash and I am \u201cstuck\u201d with selling for a loss which I won\u2019t do anyways.\n\nWhat do you think about this?", "id": "ru85dj", "created_utc": 1641124344.0, "score": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.52, "num_comments": 83, "comments": [{"body": "Welcome to r/stocks!\n\nFor stock recommendations please see our portfolio sticky, sort by hot, it's the first sticky, or see [past portfolio stickies here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+%22Rate+My+Portfolio%22+-+r%2FStocks+Quarterly+Thread&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all)\n\nFor beginner advice, brokerage info, book recommendations, even advanced topics and more, please read our [Wiki here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index)\n\nIf you're wondering **why a stock moved** a certain way, check out [Finviz](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=spy) which aggregates the most news for almost every stock, but also see [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/), and even [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/).\n\nAlso include *some* [due diligence](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/duediligence.asp) to this post or it may be removed if it's low effort.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
