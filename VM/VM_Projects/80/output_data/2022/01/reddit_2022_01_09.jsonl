You want to buy bonds right before interest rates are lowered, so investors are dumping bonds and rising the 10yr.\n\nEx: KO (CocaCola) last year offered a 5%, 10yr bond for $1,000. This year after the rising of interest rates, KO will offer a 6%, 10yr bond for $1,000. Everyone wants the 6% yield, they don\u2019t want the 5% bond that someone bought last year, so if that someone wants to get out of their 5% bond they won\u2019t fetch $1000, they\u2019ll get like $925 for it. So right now people are dumping their bonds in anticipation of being able to buy higher yield bonds later in the year, and this is pushing the 10yr and all bond rates higher", "score": 194, "replies": [{"body": "I sort of wish you went on a few tangents and just kept on explaining stuff.  I would keep reading.", "score": 44, "replies": [{"body": "Lol, uh okay, a tangent it is:\n\nSo again, the guy who bought the 5% KO bond last year, if he does nothing for 9 more years, he\u2019ll collect his 5% every year and then on the last year of the bond he\u2019ll get his $50 coupon and his initial $1,000 back. If he\u2019s cool with that, he\u2019s fine. \n\nBut if he ever plans to sell his bond before maturity, interest rate changes will affect the bond price, and the more time he has left in the bonds life (the bond\u2019s duration) the more his bond\u2019s price will be affected. \n\nThe past few years where interest rates (basically) haven\u2019t changed, KO has just issued a new lot of 5% 10yr bonds year after year. Let\u2019s assume they have issued a new lot of 5% bonds every year the past ten years. Someone who bought a 5% bond 9 years ago, their bond has a duration of 1 year since there\u2019s only 1 year left in its life. Someone who bought a new 5% bond this year has a fresh 10 years duration left.\n\nIf the market collectively and suddenly assumes interest rates are about to raise 1% in the next year, the guy with the 1 year duration left on his bond doesn\u2019t really give a shit because he can just take his 5% instead of 6% on his bond for one more year and get his $1,000 back next year. He\u2019s not missing out on a lot of return. But the guy who has 10 years left is kinda fucked, because he\u2019s gonna miss out on 1% yield every year for the next 10 years. And for him, the market might even assume interest rates will move up 3% in ten years, so when the fed threatens to raise interest rates fast, the bonds with lots of duration (time) left in their lifetime get their price dropped the most. The bonds expiring soon, are way less affected. \n\nSo, Imo, the bond market is freaking out that the Fed\u2019s sudden heightened concerns about inflation means they will raise interest rates 1% this year, and all bond prices will drop, longer duration bonds prices will drop the most. So they are panicking and selling now, even though the Fed hasn\u2019t even raised rates once yet. Consequently, stock investors see the 10yr rising and foresee companies that don\u2019t make money yet and borrow a lot of money are gonna grow slower because they have to pay 1% more on the money they borrow. \n\nI think it\u2019s a little overdone though. The Fed is on the side of the market, that\u2019s clear, they won\u2019t hike 4 times this year. Also, there\u2019s only so much more bond selling that can occur, as most of the people buying bonds are managers of pensions and mutual funds that have mandated bond purchases they must make. It\u2019s not a decision, they HAVE to keep buying bonds, which will help keep rates from going much higher. \n\nThe jump we saw in the ten year last week was a lot, but it\u2019ll stop going up or slow down a lot this week unless the market freaks out even more about another bad inflation number or JPow says something stupid on Tuesday. Bonds selling will slow and the ten he will stabilize. Historically it\u2019s lived above 3% but I don\u2019t see it there for a few more years.
