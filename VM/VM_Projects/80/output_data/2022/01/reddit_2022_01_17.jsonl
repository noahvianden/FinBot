I'm 50/50 as to whether there will even be a large selloff in the indexes this year. I think we may recover over the next several weeks then see the market get more nervous if the FED hints that it will need to continue hiking rates at a similar pace next year.

They crash with injury to their occupants so rarely it almost always makes the news. Tesla has started requiring drivers allow them to review the multiple angle camera footage so that they can establish when a driver does something idiotic and tries to blame the car for the resulting outcome.\n\nAll I can see is Tesla on track to have an FSD system that is safer than the vast majority of human drivers, on my commute I almost get run into frequently due to other drivers craziness or inattention to the rules of the road (meaning, traffic laws, maintaining their own lanes, etc).I stopped riding motorcycles due to the inattention of many drivers. I look forward to when cars drive somewhat predictably, signal their lane changes, and maintain safe following distances due to intervening computing. I have been happy to buy cars with automatic braking and lane keeping and welcome the day that more cars have this tech standard, if for no other reason that they are less likely to rear end my car when their driver is distracted by their cell phone.\n\nI suspect there will be a transition time when FSD becomes fully operable and human drivers doing stupid shit (that will be recorded on camera) will cause frequent (non-fatal) collisions with self-driving cars. I also think that the insurance industry will ultimately price out the risk and that Tesla's self-driving cars will be determined to be safer (and less costly to insure) than humans insisting on driving their BMW's around. \n\nIt will eventually cost more to insure yourself to drive than to let your car drive you around, which I think will lead to Transportation as a Service, robotaxis will become the norm. I also think that the Starlink satellite network will ultimately allow Tesla to manage their fleet of robotaxis very efficiently, provide internet as a service for passengers, and also allow Teslas to constantly communicate with each other and not crash into each other at intersections, since they will know the position of all other Tesla robotaxis near them in real time.\n\nThe originator of that NY Times ad should disclose who he works for, and what their safety record is (including how many miles they have logged) with their potential competing \"autonomous driving solution\".
