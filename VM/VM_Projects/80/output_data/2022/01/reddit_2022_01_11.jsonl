{"title": "The Great Convergence and The Scarcity Economy aka Why TSLA will be worth $10T within the next few years", "selftext": "\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Never mind The Great Reset, the real defining theme of the 2020s and beyond is really The Great Convergence, as in 21st century Globalized Capitalist order is converging into the economic reality of old school Socialist countries.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Ask people who remember what life was like behind the Iron Curtain, and the consensus answer is\u00a0\u201cwe were stressed out about a lot of things, but money was not one of them\u201d. And there was a very good reason for that. In socialist countries the trouble was always that people had money but there was hardly anything to buy. Long lines and waitlists were required for essential/desirable products from food to TVs to automobiles.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0As it turned out, current day capitalist society has become exactly like that, thanks to pervasive labor and material shortages precipitated by Covid induced seismic shift in the labor market.\u00a0The situation is only going to worsen in the coming years as baby boomers, the largest demographic cohort in American history by far, continue to exit the labor market en mass, a process accelerated by a wave of early retirements and buy-outs during the initial lockdown, which saw 30 million boomers retire at once.\n\n\n Welcome to the age of \u00a0permanent scarcity, where goods and services are perpetually backlogged. Americans are now reluctantly getting used to the new normal of empty shelves everywhere as supermarkets regularly run out of essential products from cereals to meat and eggs to toilet papers; restaurants having to massively shrink their menu offerings and routinely run out of entrees; and sought after electronics are not only always sold out but also severely backlogged. And God forbid if you need to hire a contractor to do any construction work. All the good contractors/electricians/plumbers are swamped with work and massively backlogged\u2014if they even bother to take on your project at all.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 This is the age of scarcity, of labor, of parts and of physical goods and services. \u00a0This is very bad news for the part of the economy that doesn\u2019t have the scarcity factor, namely internet and SaaS stocks, which are already seeing heavy selloff since last year as treasury yield climbed up from the rock bottom. Cloud based products and services are too easy to scale compare to physical ones, and SaaS offerings have little leverage unless combined with a physical component (eg FSD with Tesla vehicle).\u00a0This process will continue in the coming years and will rival the kind of losses that internet stocks endured in the dot com bust. \u00a0This is bad news for Cathie and Ark, as she continues to double down on Docusign, Zillow and other SaaS/Internet plays. The only saving grace in Ark portfolio, and the one company that will save it from blowing up, is TSLA which will go up 10X over the next few years, making up for the losses of her other positions which will go down by 70% or more.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0That is right! TSLA is poised to take off because more than any other company, Tesla is in the enviable position of benefiting from peak scarcity, in both transportation and energy. This translates into insatiable demand that can never be filled, and unlimited pricing power for all the Tesla products and services for the foreseeable future, even as Tesla productions in auto and energy take off big time in 2022 (aka 2020 2, electric boogaloo) thanks to 4680 mass productions. TSLA is the de facto innovation index and the ultimate scarcity economy play. At a time when there is too much money chasing too few quality products in the consumer market, and too much institutional capital chasing too few quality stocks in the financial market, Tesla is where all this consumer and investor money floods into, and the price has nowhere to go except into the stratosphere. \n\n\nThe bottom line:\n\nUS labor force is aging rapidly and gen z are by far the smallest cohort. The same dynamic exists in many other countries including Western Europe and China.\nThis comes at a time when net migration from Mexico to the US is now negative. Not to mention these days young people have many many more options to make money and physical labor is considered undesirable by many. If you look hard enough for a competent contractor and construction crew eventually you will find one, but it will take you much longer and cost you a heck lot more than before. \n\n\nAnd that goes to my thesis, there are a whole lot more people who have money to spend and invest than people who need jobs. Companies like Tesla that actually can scale and churn out highly sought after products, in auto and energy, stand to reap lions share of profit from this permanent state of scarcity. \n\n\nI suspect Tesla valuation will soar to $10T in the next few years, as the impact of the Scarcity economy sets in, and then continues to grow at 30%+ annual rate afterward for many many years to come. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0", "id": "s1o7xy", "created_utc": 1641936727.0, "score": 41, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "num_comments": 84, "comments": [{"body": "The age of permanent scarcity and we\u2019re just like communist Russia?

The more demand for oil the more supply is generated.\n\nThe last few decades has shown us transitioning from \"supply\" for a lot of products transitioning from a phycial thing to data that is comparatively \"unlimited\" supply. I'd say that's essentially a renewable model. The business model changes and people struggle to figure out how to make money because the old rules don't fully apply.\n\nEVs are next to change autos and energy where supply-demand used to be very straightforward because oil is single-use. There's now a high demand for lithium but that's not at all single-use. Not only can it be used in an EV battery for a decade or more that same cell can get repurposed for stationary storage for many years beyond that. After that point the lithium can be harvested through recycling and put in new cells. We can reach a point where the demand for mining more lithium can go way down but we'll still have plenty of energy, especially as new technologies and chemistries come along for energy storage.\n\nYes, on some very fundamental levels supply-demand is still a law of economics but I think what OP is getting at is Tesla is set up to know how to navigate the new economics of renewable power. The old economics sells you power at a per-unit basis just like Kodak used to sell you 35 shots per roll of film. Now I have \"unlimited\" shots available to me on my phone. Yes, it's not actually unlimited but for what I need it might as well be. The same is going to be true for power. How do you stay alive as an old energy company charging per-unit of power in a world where other companies are selling the means to make the power yourself with a cheaper cost per monthly payments than their old energy bill? That's already happening with residential solar.\n\nSo, the old industries struggle to survive with the short-term problem of supply disruptions but long-term they'll struggle to survive even after supply finally catches up.
