I could be wrong but I always anticipated a severe crypto crash when rates went up and the Fed shrank its balance sheet.\n\nSpending certainly chokes our economy but somehow governments all around the world are incurring debt and printing loads of money and interest rates are still low. But of course all this money printing will produce serious inflation although there are still plenty of deflationary pressures like commercial property markets, retail, office space rental rates have declined sharply both in nominal and real terms. Imagine how much of a bloodbath we'd have seen without the central banks stepping in. \n\nSo with deflationary pressures in commercial real estate markets, that will mean less rent collected, lower tax assessments of property, lower tax receipts by local governments despite surges in spending, which the gap will have to be covered by tax increases elsewhere which is further deflationary. But wage pressures and Fed-induced asset bubbles are causing inflation in other areas, so we have competing stories. One of inflation and one of deflation.\n\nWell, China can't keep building more ghost cities that never end up occupied. I also thought the massive malinvestment and oversupply would have serious spillover effects, kill commodity demand, lead to a recession since when in doubt China has also leaned heavily on its property sector. \n\nI really think once the Fed actually starts tightening, despite China begging them not to tighten, whether BOJ, BOE or ECB join the tightening or not, the fragility of our economy will be laid bare. They're in a very tough spot I don't envy them. But maybe inflation will be self correcting as the fragility of the economy means once tightening begins the house falls over curing the inflation problem.

It is very rare for the Fed to be so unanchored as it has been. True we all did know inflation wasn't transitory but nobody expected the Fed to change its tune and become as hawkish as it is. So if rates rise and the Fed shrinks its balance sheet, I don't see how we break out to the upside. Has the market ever rallied while the Fed has reduced its balance sheet?
