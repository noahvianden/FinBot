I mean, he is clearly biased when he talks about transaction fees without any mention of the lightning network.

Additionally he hinted that the text/manuscript was written in december (by mentioning the price of ethereum at that time) but he chose to publish his video 2 days ago, after the violent part of the crash started - this was likely done to use the momentum of the crash to get more views, which from my vantage point is manipulation and a part of the very system that he critisizes.. he is literally profiting off of people losing money, while critisizing people profiting off of other people losing money.\n\nAnyways, it was defo worth a watch and I am sure glad that I didn't touch NFT's.

Like way better, easily.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": ">everyone would be far better of, if we helped each other more. Like way better, easily.\n\nThat, right there, is what frustrates the bejeezus out of me. If we genuinely looked after one another, if we truly embraced the idea of society and implemented systems that looked after people, whether they personally believed in it or not, we could have so much better lives. No worries about where you\u2019re going to live, no worries about what you\u2019re going to eat, no worries about seeing a doctor, taking the kids to school. All that stress no longer present in our lives. How much good that would do for society.\n\nAll that brain power focusing on solving real problems instead of worrying sick about the basics of life.\n\nMy personal pet peeve: Lizzy goes to lunch at school. She picks her food and goes to pay for it. The card is declined, mom didn\u2019t have enough money to pay for school lunch. Lizzy\u2019s tray is taken away. The food, having been served, can\u2019t be put back. So it\u2019s dumped in the trash. There\u2019s your comment on society: so focused on money that they\u2019d rather deprive a kid from a meal than to just give her a meal. It\u2019s a \u2018loss\u2019 either way but the balance is not on feeding the kid, the important part is that she doesn\u2019t \u2018get something she doesn\u2019t deserve\u2019. Result: the food is wasted, the money is lost, the kid is hungry AND humiliated. Literally everybody in this equation loses. There are no winners\n\nIf government money was scrupulously collected and managed, cutting out all the waste and as near to 100% accountable as possible, you could tell Lizzy \u2018Lizzy, we\u2019re sorry, but everybody has to do their part.\u2019 Still a bullshit argument but you could make the economic, if not the social case.\n\nObviously that\u2019s not the case and money is wasted, in tens of billions of dollars on a daily basis. But: giving a poor school kid a good and decent lunch for free, we\u2019re not doing that, that would be socialism! The cost of feeding the nation\u2019s hungry would be trivial. But it would send a message: you don\u2019t have to worry about eating a good meal, we\u2019ll take care of you because we love you and value you and want you to do well in life. That\u2019s a message that would resonate through society. But that is not what the kid sees. The kid sees: you\u2019re poor, you\u2019re worthless, fuck off you\u2019re not getting anything. And so we have school lunch debt now. Welcome to the rest of your life: school lunch debt when you\u2019re a pre-teen, seamlessly merging into a debt-riddled life for the remainder of your natural life. Football players get to score big brownie points for cancelling school lunch debt. Which is nice, kind, noble of them to do but it should never have to happen in the first place.\n\nI\u2019m sorry for the rant, this is something I think about often and it annoys the fuck out of me. I can see that kid going back to class hungry, in the richest nation on Earth, and s\u2019/he knows that when they come home there won\u2019t be any food at all, or maybe mom or dad managed to cobble together something from the last remaining food dollars that week.\n\nIt is profoundly, desperately aggravating.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Hey man, appreciate the rant.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat right there is what infuriates me as well. I live in Denmark where Lizzy (or 'Kristine') gets a meal. While I appreciate that, I still have access to the internet, which shows me a world like yours - and that is the 'best of the worst', because we both know, that in some countries, Lizzy would have to steal that meal in order to survive and possibly risk having her hand chopped off brutally.  \nStill, in Denmark, a lot of investors, when asked, say that they always focus on profits first - meaning that many invest in companies that are bad for the world e.g. a company that gives out loans to people with a poor credit score while asking up to 827% yearly interest. (At least this became prohibited by law now, but I am pretty sure that they will still rip of people in their best way possible, and people will still profit from investing in those companies along with other far worse companies).\n\nSo even when people have almost everything they could wish for they (or we) are still greedy bastards. I say \"we\", because even though I try my best to be good, I sometimes also do sub-optimal selfish things, but hey, some of us are doing our best, while we see selfish bastards do just fine). \n\nBtw, the counterargument for taxing companies in Denmark is aaaaalways that they would just leave Denmark and make a profit in other Countries, \"hence we should let them be\" (e.g. American companies and other large companies don't pay shit except for the paycheck that people \\_work\\_ for and pay taxes of). Stuff like that is what makes a lot of people lose hope.\n\nHowever, if I have to look at it from the bright side; As the common man seem to become increasingly powerful due to the increase in access to technology, knowledge, and our basic needs, there are movements pursuing good deeds. I know that mostly it pays of to be an evil cunt, but in my time (only 36), it seems like there is a change going on. Although it is slow, it is happening, at least to my eyes it seems that way.\n\nAlso, I comfort my self by looking at good people and people that suck. It doesn't seem like it \\_really\\_ pays of to suck. Even though there is a chance you become more powerful and even risk hurting other people - it doesn't seem like these assholes are really happier. Ever since I started taking responsibility for my own live and own up to all of my own decisions, I have become way happier than if I try to avoid conflict or pretend to not understand how evil cunts people can be. Sort of like the good old quote \"The truth shall set you free\".   \n\n\nSo I am hopeful and fearful for the future at the same time. And every time I meet people like you, my hope increases, because it lets me know, that other people are thinking the same things as well, and some of us can become spiritual and ethical leaders for groups of people that have a say in this world.

And sad that you have been managed by idiots. To be fair, there are really idiots everywhere. My girlfriend is a veterinarian and works for the municipality as a health inspector for food producing companies, and boy oh boy does she tell some stories about bad leadership. Her boss were promoted back in time because she was good at doing what my girlfriend is hired for. Which means that she has no management skills, because they did not hire her on management merit. The poor manager\u00b4s bosses are apparently even worse, and from what I hear about the municipality from others working there, one of the huge drawbacks are that no one takes responsibility for anything and people waste precious time doing absolutely worthless work. Therefore, a lot of the resources that our tax pays for are wasted. That's a drawback of the capitalistic-socialistic ruling we have here. But of course it's great that we to some degree take care of each other and even the most worthless people can have nice jobs hehe. I guess that is also an argument towards being more liberal - that people with own more up to their responsibility and try harder. Which reminds me of a great youtube video I watched last year. I was always bouncing between; whether I am lucky or skilled. The video is called \"Is success luck or hard work?\" by Veritasium. I can really recommend watching it if the topic interests you (only 12 min).\nIn short, being liberal is really naive, because firstly, who the fuck are you to think that you have accomplished anything on your own? You have soldiers at the borders, the pavement on the sidewalks and roads were there before you were born, and even though you pay for tuition, someone else is literally teaching you how to be successful. We are all reliant on a system that we are born into (as you called a failed system). I mean it is definitely flawed, but to think that any one person can accomplish anything on his own is really mind boggling to me. Especially in Denmark the idea is bonkers; we get paid to go to school. So anyone 'making it' were at some point paid to study or worked at least minimum wage (which is also quite a sum of money in world standards). Peope are so spoiled that it makes my head explode sometimes :).\nSecondly, even though you worked really hard, you were also lucky, because many others less fortunate probably worked just as hard or even harder but were just unlucky. That's just the way it is.\n\nBut yeah I can totally see where you are getting at about Americans being arrogant as hell thinking they are some race chosen by god to reign the world, just because their ancestors a few hundred years ago left Europe (probably because they couldn't make it there) to plonder an entire continent with vast amounts of resources and were first in the capitalistic race to achieve economic dominance during the 20th century. \nThat is what we have to fight :-) As you wrote, we must inspire others to succeed by being at least a minimum amount of Good, because when bad people keep succeeding, it keeps motivating other people to be bad imho.\n\nI never watched 'forbrydelsen', sorry. There are some Danish movie pearls that I absolutely love (like \"Blinkende Lygter\" or some of 'Lars Von Trier'ss movies).\n\n\nBtw, you seem like a fellow tryhard, which is nice. I don't always tryhard, but when I do, I submerge into whatever I do. And I think your point about Americans is also what prohibits stuff like learning the Metric system.
