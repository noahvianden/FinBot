{"title": "Newbie investor losing money\u2014advice needed", "selftext": "I am a newbie investor (30 years old). Started investing in mid September 2021 and I was quite happy in the first couple of months as I had made about 4-5% profit. However, as of today, I am looking at a 5.5% loss\u2026\n\nMy plan is to invest half of my monthly savings and the other half put them in a high-yield savings account. Being in tech myself and having seen my 401K making more than 20% year by year since 2019, I started with Robinhood and bought some strong tech stocks (Apple, Amazon, google, Microsoft). Then I made the mistake of over-diversifying and buying some speculate stocks and ETFs (ARK, snowflake, etc.).\n\nLong story short: I realized this is not a viable strategy for long term wealth and decided to invest future allocations in indices and more reliable ETFs (SPY, QQQ, VTI, VOO, SCHD, SPHD). As of today, I would say my portfolio consists of about 20% VTI, VOO, SPY, and QQQ.  Another 25% is AMAZON, Apple, Google, and MS. About 25% is speculative/hyped ETFs and stocks, which I bought either because of past good performance or because of potential (e.g., ARKF, ARKW, CLOU, CIBR, FINX, SNAP, SE, SEV, RIVN, UPST, LCID, CVNA, FUBO). About 15% are ETFs and stocks that I consider \u201csafe\u201d in the long run (e.g., BRK, DRGO, SCHD, SPHD, EXP), 7% sector specific ETFs (SMH, VGT, IGV), and 3% crypto (BTC and ETH).\n\nFrom now on, I plan to stop buying individual stocks and speculative stuff and continue investing in VTI, SPY, QQQ and maybe ETFs that I consider reliable (e.g., SCHD, SPHD, VGT, SMH).\n\nMy question is: should I sell the speculative part of my portfolio (which has taken a big hit over the past month or so), accept the losses, but get some capital to invest in VTI, SPY, and QQQ or forget about it and simply continue investing in the way I mentioned above, since the speculative part of the portfolio will become smaller and smaller?\n\nI have to say that seeing a 5.5% loss does bother me\u2026\n\nAny advice will be much appreciated.", "id": "ryvja0", "created_utc": 1641631947.0, "score": 44, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 88, "comments": [{"body": "Hello!

You are on the right track to be buying ETFs and Index funds, one brokerage I would recommend is Vanguard, it offers an amazing service and they are well led, although the platform can be a bit weird to navigate at first it is worth it. \n\nNever sell those ETFs, the longer you hold the more upside potential there is, rather than trying to time the market for the best prices, I recommend just putting $\\_\\_\\_ per month into the investments, you can set up automatic investments to do it for you. So no matter what you are always buying in, whether it is at an all-time high or when it is crashing your dollar-cost averaging will lead you to success, and try to find ETFs that align with your goal in investing. Ask yourself whether or not the money you're putting in will affect you if it went to 0, if so I would recommend using a moderate or conservative approach especially if you are planning to start a family. One more thing as well, is that if you want you can throw a few hundred or thousand depending on what you can afford to lose on small cap ETFs or stocks so if they do gain value you would have gained some money and if they don't it won't affect you financially.
