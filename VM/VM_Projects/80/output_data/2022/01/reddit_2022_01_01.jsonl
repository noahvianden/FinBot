{"title": "Behold the 3rd largest automaker!", "selftext": "Rivian (RIVN) is a corporation damned to bankruptcy because it missed the boat on the electric vehicle adoption curve. This is because in the normal 2023 and early 2024 model years most traditional automakers will: have figured out how to make EV\u2019s, and more importantly produce them at scale.\n\nThe bull case for disruptive tech companies in general is that they can build market share and profit margins based on that market share and product lock in. The problem is that the global auto industry is figuring out battery electric vehicles. This means that the future profit streams are going to be subject to the meat grinder called the global auto industry (one of the most competitive industries on earth)!\n\nIf battery electric vehicles are not successful due to the fundamental constraints of the technology, traditional auto makers have the legacy products continuing to make money and can sell electric vehicles as a niche product to improve cafe ratings!\n\nBut even more importantly; Rivian unlike Tesla (TSLA) does not have the time to develop their production capabilities, without normal automakers catching up on battery electric vehicle technology! So even if battery electric vehicles are the future: the fact is, that Rivian does not have the physical capital and know how to produce vehicles at scale. Tesla was inches away from bankruptcy, when Tesla was figuring out how to produce the Model 3! How much more so will Rivian be, when other auto manufacturers release their competing battery electric vehicles, (for example Honda\u2019s (HMC) release of the Honda Prologue, which is most likely to be about the size of the Honda Pilot, or Acura MDX; or more importantly the Rivian R1S! And of course, Honda can produce a Ridgeline version of the Prologue to compete against the R1T.)\n\nUnfortunately, Rivian has missed the boat. Have fun watching the stock return to her actual value! Or you can heed my warning and sell now for a great profit.\n\nThis is her form 10-Q.
