We still have small room to move up until  at least the gap fills so im not rushing this.\n\nDo note that VIX is abormally high PM, and more often than note, this give us a red day.\n\nWill hedge my postion with shorter dated 1 week calls QQQ.\n\nThe  reason for the hedge is that i dont expect the market to run past this  week. If it does i will be closing my Puts postion anyway as by that  point if we are still running we ahve broken out of the falling wedge  and above data was likely good.\n\nIf  you liked this anaylsis check out my profile and throw me a follow.\n\nCheers and good luck to all!", "id": "vls60s", "created_utc": 1656324872.0, "score": 139, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 78, "comments": [{"body": "I will give you my research, I bought PUTS so its gonna rally.

The reality is that there a multiple traders looking at multiple support/resistance lines, trendlines, fib extensions, etc etc all the time.  So, it's not a case of one line working only if *everyone* looks at the same line.  It's more a case of there being several lines or dates or magic moon numbers, each of which might present different probabilities of support or resistance.\n\nThe more common patterns actually do have quite rational explanations behind why they are shaped the way they are, so it's not always about arbitrary lines becoming self-fulfilling prophecies.  It's too lengthy to go into here in great detail, but a lot of the price action you see on any given chart results from institutional traders accumulating or distributing stocks with certain price targets in mind, or it results from indecision in the market as traders are unsure what a stock is about to do next.\n\nOne simple example is resistance lines.  In some cases, they represent price limits that institutional traders have been instructed to go no higher than in their accumulation.  So, you'll see price climbing with increasing volume, and then stop dead on the line, volume then dropping through the floor.  The sellers that have been supplying liquidity keep their orders open, so the price drops down again now that buying (demand) has reduced.  Insto trader tentatively starts hitting the book with bids again, ramping up as more sellers join the party, pushing the price back up to that line again and the cycle repeats.  Sometimes, other traders spot this and join the buying to ride the momentum, and the sellers might also decide to hold off or even become buyers.  This gradually results in the price falling a little less than last time in between those buying cycles, causing an upward sloping trendline to form tending towards the horizontal resistance.  Eventually, more traders cotton on to this accumulation and pile in, pushing the price up through resistance with substantial volume.  The pattern that this very rational market behaviour has formed here is a common *Ascending Triangle* that broke to the upside, as they often do.\n\nCC u/aManPerson, u/DarkStarOptions.", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.37554943561553955}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6088335514068604}, {"body": "I would say.
