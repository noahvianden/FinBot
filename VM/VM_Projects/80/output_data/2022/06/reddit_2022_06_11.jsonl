{"title": "In the long term we are all dead, In the short and intermediate term, we are all SCREWED!", "selftext": "The CPI sure hit it out of the park today, exceeding every expectation and destroying the notion that inflation has peaked already. Shortly afterwards, the consumer sentiment number came in at a record low of 50.2, down 14% from May. The FED meets next week and apparently 75 basis points may be on the table (it should). Oh, and the first big chunk of assets from the FED's balance sheet is going to roll off on the 15th, resulting in god-knows-what reaction in the bond markets?\n\nThe economic turmoil is just getting started and there doesn't appear to be any signs of things changing. Looking over the CPI report, the numbers are way worse than even the headline number suggests. May came in at 1% m/o/m, signaling that double digit inflation may be in our future. The food category was up 1.2% for the month and many segments are showing mid teens increases y/o/y. A third of the overall weighting of the CPI is shelter, which is ridiculously underreported at 5.5%. Average rents have gone up 15% and home prices 20% in the last year. What would this number look like if properly calculated???\n\nConsumer sentiment has always been more of a \"soft\" economic number, given that it is based on feel rather than hard numbers. But a decline that puts the figure below both 2008 and 1999 is nevertheless  startling. When you add anecdotal evidence to the equation it becomes even more real. Layoffs, hiring freezes and recinided jobs offers are just a portion. People are pessimistic about housing purchases, gas prices and energy costs, to name a few. The thing about sentiment is that it can become powerful enough to actually change the more hardened economic numbers. If people feel that everything is more expensive, they may feel poorer and spend less as a result, even if their budgetary reality is not as bad as it seems. It can become a self fulfilling prophecy.\n\nAnd then there are the financial markets. Despite the recent beatings that most financial instruments have taken since the end of last year, QQQ and SPY are still about 20% higher than pre-pandemic levels. Keep in mind that we are currently in a highly inflationary period at the start of a rate hike cycle, with the FED beginning to unwind its massive balance sheet, unlike pre-pandemic. There still appears to be a lot farther that asset prices can fall.\n\nThe reason that these issues aren't going to go away anytime soon is due to (my new favorite term) \"excessive savings.\" This term has popped up quite a bit recently and refers to the amount of savings that households have compared to the pre stimulus days. Most projections put this number in the $2 trillion range. It's funny that higher savings rates are now viewed as an economic problem. On the one hand, it is this cash that has helped spur the inflation that is currently devouring purchasing power. On the other hand, this \"excess\" cash is going to keep inflation higher for longer as people spend down their savings until they reach a level of discomfort that causes them to pull back.  That may take awhile. \n\nTo add one more ingredient to the shit sandwich that we are staring down, how much leverage is there actually being employed in our financial markets? We all got a deserved laugh at Bill Hwang blowing up billions using ridiculous leverage in his opaque family office dealings.  His mentors at Tiger Global Management are down 50%, making one wonder what type of risk they have on their books. Elon leveraged his TSLA shares to buy Twitter. Michael Saylor from MSTR leveraged a balance sheet full of fake internet money to get loans to buy more fake internet money. The big guys are doing these types of things, but what about the small fish?\n\nThere was a hilarious post the other night about someone who sold their house and instead of paying cash for the next property, they put a big chunk in stocks and took a margin loan against their portfolio to pay for the place. After 5 weeks of declines, they were facing a $250k margin call that they couldn't meet.  Who knows if this is even true, but we see actual examples of this stuff in the daily financial news pretty frequently with the big fish. How many little fish are leveraged to the hilt?\n\nLong story short, we are facing historically high inflation, rising interest rates, quantitative tightening, plummeting consumer sentiment, falling markets and potential issues that haven't even come to light yet. What could go wrong???\n\nPositions: Cash gang waiting for a decent entry (QQQ 250, SPY 350 at a minimum)\n\nTLDR: The economy is screwed....", "id": "v9ocsa", "created_utc": 1654916722.0, "score": 126, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 86, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|36|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|798|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=v9ocsa)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=v9ocsa)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.40511640906333923}, {"body": "Sure feels like shit\u2019s hitting the fan and we\u2019re going to continue drilling lower.
