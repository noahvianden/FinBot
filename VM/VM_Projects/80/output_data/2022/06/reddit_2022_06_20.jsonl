It's far from a sure thing that Q2 will not be negative. As of now, the latest estimate from the Atlanta Fed [GDPNow](https://www.atlantafed.org/cqer/research/gdpnow) forecast is for growth of 0.0%. Granted, most private forecasts are higher, but a lot of forecasts missed in Q1 and could miss again. \n\n2. \"If jimmy has $100 to spend from his job and he has to spend it all to fill up on gas and can\u2019t go see top gun\" then yes, his nominal spending would still be $100, but his real spending would have declined. The number that is looked at for whether the economy is growing or not is real GDP, not nominal GDP. In Q1 for example, when real GDP growth was -1.5%, nominal was +6.5%.  \n\nThat said, I agree we are probably not yet in a recession. None of the items that are typically leading indicators of falling consumer spending, such as [airline travel, movie box office, or hotel occupancy](https://www.calculatedriskblog.com/2022/06/five-high-frequency-indicators-for_20.html), or furniture sales, are yet signalling a decline. Neither are labor market indicators such as unemployment claims or quits. Basically the main indicators suggesting a possible recession right now are consumer confidence surveys and the stock market, but both of those are most likely due to inflation rather than to any economic slump. \n\nIn addition, even if Q2 does come in slightly negative, that still likely wouldn't meet the definition of a recession that is actually used by the NBER, which is a little more involved and likely won't register a recession until there is some meaningful decline in either employment or real incomes.
