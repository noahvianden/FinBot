The agency said in a separate report last week that it had documented more than 200 crashes involving Teslas that were using Autopilot, \u201cFull Self-Driving,\u201d Traffic-Aware Cruise Control or some other of the company\u2019s partially automated systems.\n\nTesla\u2019s figure and its crash rate per 1,000 vehicles was substantially higher than the corresponding numbers for other automakers that provided such data to The Associated Press ahead of NHTSA\u2019s release. The number of Tesla collisions was revealed as part of a NHTSA investigation of Teslas on Autopilot that had crashed into emergency and other vehicles stopped along roadways.\n\nTesla does have many more vehicles with partly automated systems operating on U.S. roads than most other automakers do \u2014 roughly 830,000, dating to the 2014 model year. And it collects real-time data online from vehicles, so it has a much faster reporting system. Other automakers, by contrast, must wait for reports to arrive from the field and sometimes don\u2019t learn about crashes for months.", "id": "vca3wy", "created_utc": 1655231357.0, "score": 258, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 86, "comments": [{"body": "Tesla collects and provides actual data.

Ford has only delivered a couple hundred electric F-150s and has only delivered 30k EVs in total so far. Technically, Ford has delivered more electric trucks because the Cybertruck is not in production, but there's allegedly over a million Cybertruck reservations. Not all will translate to sales, but even 20% would be 200k+ deliveries.\n\nFord delivered 1.9M vehicles in 2021 and this number isn't expected to increase much in the future.
