[Chart here](https://theatlas.com/charts/S18QCJyhe).\n\nObviously that is just cherry picking. My point is to separate what you think of as driving the future / economy from driving stock returns. The best stock returns will come from companies you have never even heard of and can only get exposure to through index funds (e.g., small cap value index funds). Historically, small cap stocks and small cap value beat large cap growth stocks.\n\nWhen every investor thinks a company's stock does well, its price gets bid up and reduces future returns. Take a look at how well Union Pacific railroad did historically compared to the S&P 500. It's a boomer stock that most investors don't care about, but its stock behaved like a big tech stock. Overweighting 2T market cap stocks that have had incredible returns is going to be a good strategy, but not a great strategy for the long term unless you believe the companies that are winning today are the same as those winning in 20 years.\n\nMoreover, keep in mind that most index funds are already quite heavy in big tech, so if you own SPY or something, you already have heavy exposure to these companies.\n\nI'm not saying your portfolio needs to be full of companies like John Deere, American Water Company, etc. Certainly AWK is not going to outperform GOOGL (probably).", "score": 41, "replies": [{"body": "I agree overall with the sentiment of your post.
