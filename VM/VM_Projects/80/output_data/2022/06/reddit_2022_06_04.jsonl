{"title": "Dave & Buster's Calls are the Canary in the Coal Mine", "selftext": " \n\nIntroduction:\n\nFirst and foremost friends I would like to thank you all for still sticking around and reading my due diligences. I know it has been tough these last few and I have now been horribly wrong on Zoom as well as Lululemon. While nobody can be right all or even most of the time I own up to my own incorrect positions here and I hope for those of you that took my advice that we can recoup some of those losses here and now. Additionally, as a note this is not financial advice and I am just a college student who does these on the side for fun. Anyways, enough of the bullshit and let's get to the position for this week. Dave & Busters (PLAY) is the move for this week. As the most important piece of advice here, earnings is on Tuesday before market open, so if you take this ride with me we all could lose due to the implied volatility (IV) crush after earnings just as what happened with LULU unfortunately. That being said, I personally feel that the position here is naked long calls. However, the \u201csafer\u201d position may very well be a long strangle (an OTM call and put).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nReason 1:\n\nEarnings are coming up, on Tuesday, before market open to be exact. That being said, I expect an earnings beat as well as an optimistic forecast for the rest of the year within PLAY\u2019s earnings call which is just as important as the earnings beat. I personally think this will be enough to cause a sharp upward move in share price that will outpace the decline in implied volatility after earnings. As a result, it will hopefully be tendies for all. I believe that earnings will shatter expectations as well as an increase in profit (forecasts) because Dave & Buster\u2019s caters to a wealthier customer base. For example, of all the arcade family fun places, Dave & Buster\u2019s is far and away the most expensive and it also caters to adults who have far more disposable income. While I am by no means a useful proxy for the entirety of PLAY\u2019s customer base, I myself am a huge video game player and overall nerd and I enjoy frequenting Dave & Buster\u2019s, I can only imagine the money that people who are as big of nerds as myself with more disposable income spend there. Evidence for such a move includes recent earnings of other upper middle class businesses such as Victoria\u2019s Secret and Lululemon both beating earnings and raising profit forecasts. I believe this bodes well for PLAY. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nReason 2:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/705tyby8yi391.png?width=771&format=png&auto=webp&s=db2fdff6b26b97d4ee26da6ff24395be044518cd\n\nAbove is PLAY\u2019s income statement. Upon a brief and I mean very brief, slightly Bud Light buzzed analysis, one thing in particular jumps out to me. First, total revenues as well as gross profits annually stick out to me. Both of these are of extreme importance because being literate tells us that both total revenues and gross profits exceed pre-pandemic numbers and very nearly best the 2020 pandemic numbers. The reason I see this as so incredibly bullish is because if revenues for the past year rivaled the Jerome Powell money printing era, is that not indicative of a growing, healthy business, even more so impressive in the current climate in which many consumer driven businesses are struggling. (See Walmart and Target for example) I mean good lord so many payments such as mortgage payments, student loans, and other things were all totally suspended in 2020 on top of stimulus checks and even with all of that benign conducive to booming revenues and profits for PLAY, PLAY nearly equaled that in the last annual period!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fo5hoc0ayi391.png?width=757&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc34cbb4aaef91355875db15bad2bdf909ea88ca\n\nAbove is PLAY\u2019s balance sheet. Examining this, I felt the confirmation bias deep in my bones for my bullish soon to be naked long calls position when looking at cash/ cash equivalents as well as net receivables. When simultaneously looking into both, I find it fascinating that cash/ cash equivalents increased in the last fiscal year to a point to where it is the largest it has been in the last 4 years while also having the second largest net receivables of the last 4 years. Logic would dictate that more net receivables would mean less cash but in this case PLAY seems to be generating both at a quicker rate than in the past. Additionally, one would expect total current liabilities and more specifically accounts payable to have increased as a result of this increase in business that drove net receivables as well as cash/ cash equivalents and yet total current liabilities only marginally increased in comparison to the growth experienced in net receivables as well as cash & cash equivalents. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nReason 3:\n\nAttempting to place myself in the shoes of the average American consumer, I do not believe that PLAY is out of consumer\u2019s budgets yet nor do I believe spending will have significantly decreased there yet. If other businesses that are in retail or food industries have not caved yet to the macroeconomic pressures facing the US markets, then I believe that PLAY will not either and as a result will have a solid quarter. I do not believe PLAY is sound long term or even past the date of a short term options position to be honest, however, I certainly believe this could be the last gasp for a US economy before we enter a recession. While some would argue that PLAY will suffer just as Walmart and Target did, I would counter with stronger than expected earnings from Costco, Macy\u2019s, and Nordstrom. I see these companies not as comparables to PLAY, however I do believe they have a similar customer base in middle class/ upper middle class Americans. Upper middle class Americans have weathered the inflation and supply chain shitstorm that has been bestowed upon the United States. As a result, PLAY will do well. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhere I could be wrong:\n\n1. The house of cards has begun to fall, starting with a slowdown in consumer spending within the middle class/ upper middle class markets, obliterating PLAY revenues. \n2. IV crush. This is the most important right. I, or you for that matter could be correct but if the underlying stock price does not move enough to offset the lessening of IV after earnings, all parties are fucked, bulls, bears, it does not matter. \n3. I am wrong about PLAY\u2019s demographic. If PLAY\u2019s demographic is not a predominantly middle class or preferably upper middle class base, I am fucked. Their earnings will do a Walmart and Target but part 3 and quite possibly more disastrous in terms of the destruction to our call premiums.\n4. Neither happens, no move up, no move down. In this case a strangle would suffer the most as a result of the additional premiums paid banking on a large movement in the stock price. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nClosing Remarks:\n\nFellow apes please do grill me in the comment section of this post before market open Monday. As you all know, I do my DDs and then open a position the following day (usually Monday) so if I am missing something let me know. My head is an echochamber in which the last two brain cells that escaped the glue I sniffed constantly bang around coming up with shit like these options positions. Lastly, I appreciate you all more than you know, anyone who views, upvotes, comments, or direct messages me means the absolute world to me. Although I am on a losing streak the last few positions I have quite a bit of fun doing this and if you would like to see more feel free to view my last posts and/ or follow me as I do a DD every week and if not each week it is at least biweekly. Have a good night friends, and happy soon to be tendies! \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR\n\nDave & Buster\u2019s is going to crush earnings expectations and give an increased profit forecast going forward as their wealthier demographic continues to spend in their food and arcade business. Additionally, the financials are indicative of earnings being fantastic before market open Tuesday. Therefore, buy calls, make tendies, or if that puckers your asshole too much, open a strangle so when this shit bounces around more than a Boeing 737 that was never properly inspected, you can make money. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPosition:\n\n5 PLAY $40 C 7/15", "id": "v4g89j", "created_utc": 1654313707.0, "score": 37, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 84, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|9|**First Seen In WSB**|1 month ago\n**Total Comments**|257|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uuczdi/buildabear_is_going_to_bear_tendies/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uud7te/buildabear_is_going_to_bear_tendies/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/v28sd1/lululemon_calls_are_a_goldmine/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ug4yda/coinbase_is_going_into_the_toilet/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/upx05n/zoom_is_fucked/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/upx6v7/zoom_is_fucked/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/v4g89j/dave_busters_calls_are_the_canary_in_the_coal_mine/) \n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=v4g89j)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=v4g89j)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.42221540212631226}, {"body": "Dave and Buster\u2019s demo upper middle class ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641)", "score": 29, "replies": [{"body": "Better yet just inverse me lol", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "On it", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Someone will get schmoney and that\u2019s all that matters", "score": 6, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.14369863271713257}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.18844741582870483}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.02165292575955391}, {"body": "Let me dream lol", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "You\u2019d be lucky if 50% of the people in a D&B\u2019s at any one time  had a full set of teath", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "Lord knows I don\u2019t", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Well done my dude \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffd", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Now I just pray that IV crush doesn\u2019t obliterate me", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1744716763496399}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.11180334538221359}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.27127882838249207}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.26810476183891296}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.08111871033906937}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.286212295293808}, {"body": "Guy starts off with an apology for being consecutively wrong and hits us with the Billy Mays \"but wait, there's more!\" \n\nLove it, I'm in.", "score": 19, "replies": [{"body": "I didn\u2019t hear no bell.", "score": 6, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.25584352016448975}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.17338857054710388}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 36, "replies": [{"body": "Good point.
