{"title": "6-9-22 SPY Daily TA (bonus CPI day trade breakdown)", "selftext": "Well aint that a beautiful site to see! Finally a beautiful trend day. And one that gave us many answers that I said we were missing yesterday in our daily TA. My overnight puts paid out a nice 33% at open too ( I was busy with family stuff so I took profits instead of letting them eat). \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pe0inyakwo491.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=a06292154f34a2cae61af40b40403d16e03ebef7\n\nAfter that morning \u201cbreakout\u201d and rejection at 411.7 it was pretty much down hill all day from there. Bulls actually put up a convincing fight at 1pm that then led to a massive 2.3% drop over the next 3 hours. I was not able to capitalize as much as I would have liked to on this dip only because I have major trust issues with SPY. With the last two week full of BS reversals and fake outs and huge drops followed by bigger rips I just couldn\u2019t stay in the way I wish I coulda have. But I was still able to grab some small wins. I will have more trust in SPY and an overall direction/ trend once CPI and FOMC are over. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wvjtqovkwo491.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=100cddfee3da6a4eba87292bf0449564b3278b39\n\nYesterday I mentioned the VIX had bounced off the key 23.8 level and that I would be looking for the bounce to 25.5 intraday and eventually 30 over the next few days (if not tomorrow). Well we closed at 26 today. That means we are officially back in the 25.5 to 34.5 VIX channel that we spend almost a month and a half trading within. With that rejection off 23.8 and breaking 25.5 I suspect we will see some red ahead and will be looking for 29.6 VIX tomorrow. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hvf3ffdlwo491.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=285d0cff5ee4e442c753833063c8e9c9491b6aa6\n\nThe daily chart looks a little busy but let me explain it so you can see what I see. Yesterday I mentioned that we were right at a key support for a massive ascending wedge on the daily (red dotted lines) well today we confirmed broke that and broke some other major supports. I was watching for support at 407.9 but today SPY broke through a ton of major supports that gives me confirmation of some bearish days ahead. We not only broke the daily 8/20 ema we closed below them. We also broke the purple channel which means there is not support bounce coming. IT should be pretty much red from here on out. If you track the blue arrows you will see the breakout, rest/ rejection and now the impending dip back to 380-390. It actually looks like an inverse cup and handle forming to me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o374090mwo491.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c920b8a55e4758dc9f88dd37b9fe0b1c55d092c\n\nHere is a cleaned up and updated daily SPY. What I am going to look for tomorrow IF we don\u2019t just open and drill is a possible bounce and rejection of 405.5 resistance (there is a slight possibility we see 406.6 which is the 15min major channel resistance). I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see a red open after CPI, the usually morning breakout followed by the 1030 am dump. I think we will see SPY close EOD near 395-398 support (with 398 being the next major support on the daily). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/utomnzimwo491.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=2736be072873b6b1d13ceb79c692a7fa287db0ae\n\nI had also mentioned yesterday that we are seeing a triple top on the weekly chart and well with this drop today we are now seeing SPY at the V shaped recovery support line with 400 being a confirmed break of support. We also are pretty much outside of a MASSIVE 3%+ green day tomorrow confirming our 2nd red week in a row now. That means 9 of the last 10 weeks for SPY have been red. I anticipate a closure of SPY under 400 tomorrow for the week and that we will retest 380 range next week with FOMC being the catalyst to really spike VIX and drill SPY. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gwicr72nwo491.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d5e769ad44018327ff43ad48908c225e14535e7\n\nOverall looking at the last 5 CPI releases you can see 3 of the last 5 were red opens with two of them being significantly red (I posted this in a separate post early and someone corrected me that I had made the April 12th open red instead of green). The odds of a red open tomorrow is fairly good in my opinion. This is also the biggest drop for the two days leading to CPI yet. With this massive afternoon drop and how unusually bullish everyone has been speaking about CPI and that the recession is off I think we are gearing up for a huge miss. If markets and big money truly expected a great CPI tomorrow we would closed 2.5% green not 2.38% red today in my opinion. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yox1xqmnwo491.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=6002452bdbb0f02f3e5292ad30a4c602ce688ba9\n\nCurrently markets are expecting along with consensus of a 8.3% CPI which is the SAME as last month. I have a feeling we come in near 8.4 to 8.5%. Which will mean inflation has not quite peaked and will definitely mean inflation is not coming down. Now if the off chance we come in higher then 8.5% (February missed by 0.3%) that would really in my opinion drill SPY into the ground tomorrow as there would be no hiding that inflation hasn\u2019t peaked then. It is going to be interesting to say the least. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p74bf64owo491.png?width=881&format=png&auto=webp&s=431320541bdfe193668aaeedbd758383ebf955e7\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/830lfloowo491.png?width=845&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb26555f9c9d0d7646f12401896094c34a203aa1\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/74o4u98pwo491.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=73f23cf752096c1668d8e6c5b823f40bb6038a4b\n\nAs you can see backtesting that the last 5 CPIs no matter opening green or red we will see the peak of the day around 1030am. From there SPY had 5 out of the 5 last times dumped or at minimum traded back at open. Its pretty safe to assume we will open and see a pop till 1030 and then see a drop from there on out. I had called out to my server I was definitely going to play puts just for the favorable odds not only over night but intraday that I at minimum would see a break even. IF you took puts with me I highly recommend taking profits at open. The Only reason I would not take profits at open is if we see 8.5% or higher CPI and markets show no recovery pre-market. If CPI truly comes in bad enough there is a chance we might see markets just drill all day long. The VIX is low enough to allow a -3 to -4% day without much effort. I also will not be taking a loss on my puts at open if we happen to open green and will let them ride till EOD with expectation of the same trend. \n\nAlso looking at the last 5 CPIs (refer back to my chart above) you can see that 3 of the last 5 CPIs the FOLLOWING day saw a massively red day. Also to note that 5 of the last 5 opened red the following day (the May -0.1% day is deceiving as we actually saw SPY open -0.8% and reach a low of 1.9% before it recovered that day). I will be almost certainly regardless of CPI outcome taking a high probability put position EOD tomorrow. \n\n10% challenge\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5bifm8wpwo491.png?width=489&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1a859020ab8ca30061c0f4d83f4093b2e37e8b6\n\nI definitely was scared money today. I still reached almost 5x my daily goal but I had a hard time trusting the EOD drop. I just was waiting every 10 seconds for the 1% rip green. I was happy to still lock in some profits and that overnight put was excellent. My indicators were 5 of 5 lighting up bearish too but I still had trouble trusting it. This market has made it very hard to trust the obvious. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kl5bdsbqwo491.png?width=659&format=png&auto=webp&s=87f75e8d9cde77f6c9503dd451e76f9dfffd65a9\n\nRocking this bad boy overnight with the expected VIX spike and probable red open should be looking at a nice 30-50% at open.", "id": "v8vbnd", "created_utc": 1654821610.0, "score": 131, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 82, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|193|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|1754|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/v8vbnd/6922_spy_daily_ta_bonus_cpi_day_trade_breakdown/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ur9t1w/51622_spy_daily_ta/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/spxvil/spy_210_the_bear_rages_on/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uyxorz/52722_spy_pre_market/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/skp8ci/24_spy_recap_anticipation/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/us0d0d/51722_spy_daily_ta/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rj1up5/december_17th_spy_recap_and_next_week_anticipation/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/v23784/53122_spy_daily_ta/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/v6ewtr/6622_spy_daily_ta/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/up5w3m/51322_spy_weekly_ta/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/up5xtr/51322_spy_weekly_ta/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lyng6s/buy_the_rumor_sell_the_news_hear_me_out_here/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/riyt4w/december_17th_spy_recap_and_next_week_anticipation/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/usqmwy/51822_spy_daily_ta/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/v2sj0k/6122_spy_daily_ta/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/v7clxo/6722_spy_daily_ta/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uwdhxd/52322_spy_daily_ta_bonus_fomc_minutes_reaction_ta/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uwdk8h/52322_spy_daily_ta_bonus_fomc_minutes_reaction_ta/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/v3mubg/6222_spy_daily_ta/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/v82mas/6822_spy_daily_ta/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rgqp0q/spy_dec_14th_recap_and_dec_15th_anticipation/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/v48yk1/6322_spy_weekly_ta_and_analysis/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uthl4s/51922_spy_daily_ta/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uthspd/51922_spy_daily_ta/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ux4ri2/52422_spy_daily_ta_fomc_minutes_prediction/) \n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=v8vbnd)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=v8vbnd)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "this is this stuff i look forward to every evening \ud83d\ude0c My puts need to feast", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.24022209644317627}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3147050738334656}, {"body": "This is some good fucking shit", "score": 34, "replies": [{"body": "One of the most consistent quality posters here, thx daddy", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Yes thank you.

We are not that now.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "[https://dqydj.com/sp-500-return-calculator/](https://dqydj.com/sp-500-return-calculator/)\n\nI don't know how accurate the above calculation is, but put in Jan of just about any year and end in Dec, 10 years later and adjust for inflation and I don't think you will find a 10 year period where returns are negative. Maybe if you start in Jan 2029 you will get flat results. So not sure about this idea of lost decades. Maybe you are referring to Japan and not the US.\n\nAs to the Fed not stepping in to slash interest rates... I think you are clearly wrong. Historically interest rates might have been greater than the inflation rate, but if you look now you will see the interest rates are lower than inflation. Hmmmm... something to chew on. Perhaps the Fed is a lot more predictable in their approach here. The Fed is limited in how high interest rates can be based on inflation as their (perhaps unstated) objective is to help ensure inflation reduces the national debt, which only works by keeping down the interest rate (now lower than the inflation rate). Meaning while they will raise interest rates to help curb excessive inflation, they will keep that rate as low as they can and will lower it as inflation comes down, making using debt to fund investment attractive again. The only way this will ever reverse is if the national debt declines substantially and can be serviced via tax revenues.\n\nAs to your points about WW2... I am not very familiar with the war debt amounts. US National Debt by 1946 peaked at 269B (from about 40B in 1939) and I doubt amounts owed to the US then by others was a substantial part of that. Most of that debt was the US's own borrowing.\n\nSaying we had great wealth, does not  mean much. How do you even quantify that? In any case, US Household wealth was recently estimated at 150T vs national debt of about 30T. In 1946 I think that number was estimated at 885B vs national debt of 269B. So recently was about 5X the national debt and at end of WW2 was 3.3X the national debt. So seems when you look at the actual data, we are far better off now.\n\nAs to being net exporters... Who cares. The US dollar was not the global reserve currency prior to WW2. Further prior the 1970's the US was on a gold standard which impacted this a lot. Once the 1970's are over and the US is off the gold standard the need for balancing net exports against dollars in circulation and USD held out of the US is very different.

Look at Tesla and EV's coming to change the vehicle and help usher in a new age of green energy.

Maybe if you start in Jan 2029 you will get flat results. So not sure about this idea of lost decades. Maybe you are referring to Japan and not the US.\n\n1968-1979 - negative real returns\n\n2000-2010 - negative real returns\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>As to the Fed not stepping in to slash interest rates... I think you are clearly wrong. Historically interest rates might have been greater than the inflation rate, but if you look now you will see the interest rates are lower than inflation. Hmmmm... something to chew on. Perhaps the Fed is a lot more predictable in their approach here. The Fed is limited in how high interest rates can be based on inflation as their (perhaps unstated) objective is to help ensure inflation reduces the national debt, which only works by keeping down the interest rate (now lower than the inflation rate). Meaning while they will raise interest rates to help curb excessive inflation, they will keep that rate as low as they can and will lower it as inflation comes down, making using debt to fund investment attractive again. The only way this will ever reverse is if the national debt declines substantially and can be serviced via tax revenues.\n\nInterest rates cannot be reduced until inflation comes down. we have a likely negative GDP number next month and thus the 2nd consecutive quarter of contraction needed for us to officially be in recession.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>As to your points about WW2... I am not very familiar with the war debt amounts. US National Debt by 1946 peaked at 269B (from about 40B in 1939) and I doubt amounts owed to the US then by others was a substantial part of that. Most of that debt was the US's own borrowing.\n\nThe debt from WWII is unimportant given the astronomically large benefits to the US because of the war destroying large swaths Europe, the Nazis, and the Japanese while we were relatively unaffected. The war was a great investment for us. Additionally, with women entering the workforce for the first time, we tapped an additional source of labor that put downward pressure on wages while increasing total productivity. When technology and improved educational attainment is factored in, the increases in per capita productivity increased the value of companies and thus equities.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Saying we had great wealth, does not mean much. How do you even quantify that? In any case, US Household wealth was recently estimated at 150T vs national debt of about 30T. In 1946 I think that number was estimated at 885B vs national debt of 269B. So recently was about 5X the national debt and at end of WW2 was 3.3X the national debt. So seems when you look at the actual data, we are far better off now.\n\n$150T as of what date? To increase from 3.3x to 5x in 76 years when small increases in interest rates now threaten our ability to service our debt cannot seriously be considered \"better off\" especially given the economy has been fueled by debt and given all of the technological advancements in the last 75 plus years. The transistor hadn't even been invented yet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>As to being net exporters... Who cares. The US dollar was not the global reserve currency prior to WW2. Further prior the 1970's the US was on a gold standard which impacted this a lot. Once the 1970's are over and the US is off the gold standard the need for balancing net exports against dollars in circulation and USD held out of the US is very different. As long as global demand for dollars remains high, there is no reason for the US to be a net exporter of goods and services.\n\nPlease go read an economics book. This knocked your IQ down at least 10 points in my mind. If I had read this first, I wouldn't even have bothered to respond.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>As to innovation and invention. Look at Tesla and EV's coming to change the vehicle and help usher in a new age of green energy. What about developments in AI beginning to translate into meaningful things that will help us?\n\nWhat's more important, a car that runs on batteries or the invention of the  transistor?

The politicians getting paid to push this crap never talk about the heat island effect when obviously they should.

Is Heat Island an issue in non-inhabited areas? Who does it hurt? In urban environments the buildings already cause a Heat Island effect and in-fact Solar Panels may reduce it! Further it reduces the heating of homes from the sun, reducing the need to use A/C so it actually helps with things being too hot. Don't forget the reductions in CO2 emissions as well.\n\nAs to India and China putting out 1/3 of global emissions, considering they make up 35% of world population seems about right. The US on the other hand puts out 14% of global CO2 emissions and only makes up 4% of the world population. Just because they are bigger countries does not mean the US should not do its part to cut its CO2 emissions by as much as possible. If China and India were to increase emissions to match the per capita amounts in the US it would be an incredible increase in global emissions. If that does not scare you, you are not thinking. The US has a long way to go if they are to tell others what to do here.\n\nAnyways, this is my last response here.
