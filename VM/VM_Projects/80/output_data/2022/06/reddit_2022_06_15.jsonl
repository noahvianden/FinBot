They either never had to borrow it at all, because of their parents or make enough to pay it back. The people who would primarily benefit from student loan forgiveness are not high earners. Forgiving their debt would not be a transfer from low earners to high, like you imply, it would be the opposite. Whether it's inflationary is a different question.\n\nThe second point stands regardless: the idea of Biden doing loan forgiveness in the current political climate is a hearty belly laugh.

Instead of comparing graduates to the top 1% you could also compare them to the bottom 25% and realize that college graduates are relatively wealthy themselves (as a group).

Yes, forgiving student loan debt would be a windfall to a few relatively well-off people at society's expense. That would be great for those individuals but is the definition of privatizing the gains while socializing the losses. The fact that paying this via inflation also makes it regressive is just icing on the cake.\n\nIf you want to argue the system needs reform I'll be right there with you.
