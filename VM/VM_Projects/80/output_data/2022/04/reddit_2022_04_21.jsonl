Why? Because those trillion dollar companies have hundreds of people making sure every part of the company is operating as efficiently as possible.\n\nExample: Alibaba suddenly has 5 of its mega factories burn down overnight. Most of the large funds, owners of alibaba, board members, big shots, all have the information immediately and can trade or sell their stocks. The average retailer doesn't get that information until it shows up on Fidelity news or some other random stock news site.
