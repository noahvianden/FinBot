{"title": "Facebook parent Meta set to take nearly 50% cut from virtual sales \u2014 and Apple is calling it out", "selftext": "Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc.\u2019s intent to take a nearly 50% cut of digital asset sales within its emerging metaverse is drawing widespread criticism from developers and longtime nemesis Apple Inc. Meta FB, +0.40% said in a blog post Monday it is allowing a handful of Horizon Worlds creators to sell virtual assets that could eventually include NFTs. Virtual-reality platform Horizon Worlds is considered an integral piece of Meta\u2019s unfolding metaverse. The company said it will take up to 47.5% on each transaction, which includes a \u201chardware platform fee\u201d of 30% via its Meta Quest Store, as well as a 17.5% cut on Horizon Worlds.\n\n\u201cWe think it\u2019s a pretty competitive rate in the market. We believe in the other platforms being able to have their share,\u201d Vivek Sharma, Meta\u2019s vice president of Horizon, told The Verge. But Meta\u2019s plan immediately drew blowback from developers \u2014 who pointed out NFT marketplace OpenSea takes a 2.5% cut of each transaction while LooksRare charges 2% \u2014 and some pointed comments from antagonist Apple AAPL, +1.63%.\n\n\u201cMeta has repeatedly taken aim at Apple for charging developers a 30% commission for in-app purchases in the App Store \u2014 and have used small businesses and creators as a scapegoat at every turn,\u201d Apple spokesman Fred Sainz said in an email to MarketWatch. \u201cNow \u2014 Meta seeks to charge those same creators significantly more than any other platform. \\[Meta\u2019s\\] announcement lays bare Meta\u2019s hypocrisy. It goes to show that while they seek to use Apple\u2019s platform for free, they happily take from the creators and small businesses that use their own.\u201d\n\nMeta Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has blasted Apple for charging developers 30% for in-app purchases on the App Store. \u201cAs we build for the metaverse, we\u2019re focused on unlocking opportunities for creators to make money from their work,\u201d he said in November. \u201cThe 30% fees that Apple takes on transactions make it harder to do that, so we\u2019re updating our subscriptions product so now creators can earn more.\u201d\n\nUnderscoring the reaction of developers, Blockparty CEO Vladislav Ginzburg told MarketWatch: \u201cFacebook keeps all media uploaded to it, retains all user data and owns every step of the process to sell to marketers. Rather than enable creators to share in the value they bring to Facebook, their goal is to take half of the sale. No thanks.\u201d\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/facebook-parent-meta-set-to-take-nearly-50-cut-from-virtual-sales-within-its-metaverse-11649885375?cx\\_testId=22&cx\\_testVariant=cx\\_1&cx\\_artPos=0&mod=home-page-cx#cxrecs\\_s](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/facebook-parent-meta-set-to-take-nearly-50-cut-from-virtual-sales-within-its-metaverse-11649885375?cx_testId=22&cx_testVariant=cx_1&cx_artPos=0&mod=home-page-cx#cxrecs_s)", "id": "u3bxpl", "created_utc": 1649922308.0, "score": 96, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 81, "comments": [{"body": "I can't imagine buying anything in the metaverse, other than an adblocker.", "score": 91, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 27, "replies": [{"body": "Don\u2019t give them any ideas.", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.11328314244747162}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.07414841651916504}, {"body": "The ultimate adblocker: don't join the metaverse", "score": 10, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.7151056528091431}, {"body": "IMO it will be the biggest marketplace we\u2019ve ever seen.

That's pretty good price-wise. More advanced VR headsets will come out at premium prices, but they will generally trickle down into the $300-400 range over time.\n\nIn terms of computing power, have you seen the Matrix Unreal 5 demo? It's not quite photorealistic, but it's getting close, and that can run on a PS5. \n\nRealistic VR will need to leverage cloud computing if it wants to be a standalone device without being tethered to a PC or console, but I don't see why that couldn't happen in the 2030s.\n\nThere's also a few other options for photorealism. Today you can have volumetric videos - basically videos you can move inside rather than just turning your head 360 degrees. That's one way to perfect photorealism in a less dynamic scenario.\n\nAnother way is photogrammetry/light-field/NeRF scans. These are just variants in capturing the real world to display in a fully explorable 3D scene.

I agree that cloud computing might be a more viable of a solution. However I don't see it right now or anytime soon due to costs as well the existing infrastructure, especially in the US where speed is just stagnant for most of the population. You'll also need to have some revolutionary advances in areas such as rendering algorithm, physics computation and cost of producing graphic units to bring down the cost and time to render for it to be possible. Look, I know there are many advances in these areas, and you shown some perfect ones. I'm not dismissing that and I do hope they can progress it further to a point where a virtual environment can be as real as what we usually see in scifi medias.
