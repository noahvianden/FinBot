Google built their own physical data engine of this type for grasping - and dismantled it because it was too costly to maintain.  \nOpen AI had a simulated analogue to googles grasping engine - it was so costly to run that they shut the program down. The GPU-cycles simply cost too much.   \n\n\nIn addition to first building your fleet and data engine, you need the correct algorithms.

Picking fruit requires all of the items in bold above; because if you use too much force, you'll bruise or damage the fruit and then you can't sell it. Having a robot work force do this, is worth billions of dollars in labor savings and double or even triple digit offsets and gains over 10 or more years.

The plan was to do what they have always done, borrow shit loads of money, in larger & larger amounts, and keep the interest rate low so they can make the minimum payments forever, by borrowing even more money. The entire monetary system at its core is like a retard with a credit card. Well, it *was*. Due to the GFC, they are now maxing out that credit card buying treasuries, MBSs, who knows what other garbage and essentially destroying the concept of capitalism in the name of saving capitalism. \n\nThis suppresses interest rates, punishes anyone trying to save money the old-fashioned way, destroys the middle class by massively benefiting the rich while crippling the younger generations, rewards risky nonsensical investing, and creates asset bubbles in literally everything. \n\nMix this system with a global trade disruption from a pandemic, an energy crisis (due to predominantly supply side issues), a commodity crisis, a food crisis, WW3, and you get uncontrollable inflation. And inflation is the one thing that breaks this retarded monetary circle jerk. That is their goal, to stop inflation, not to balance their books. The system is meant to run on debt in a never-ending circle jerk, it isn't meant to get 20% year-over-year inflation. The financial sector is so levered up and interconnected that any sort of shock causes a domino effect. They need to reduce inflation, but not fully set off a chain reaction of destruction. They fight inflation by essentially causing a recession. They are not going to say that, but raising rates, and doing QT, in practice is just their attempt to destroy the excess money in the system and thereby reduce inflation. By more or less doing things that will almost certainly cause a recession. So I hope that makes sense, they don't care about balancing their books, they care about inflation, and saying they are doing QT is actually their attempt at destroying money, it isn't really about what they have on their books, it's about the pain they are threatening to unleash on the markets and the way the market will react to that threat. \n\nThe thing is, like I said before, the system is so fucked right now due to decades of compounded retardation, it's set up like dominos. Basically picture a guy with full-blown AIDs in the 1980s is in a clean room (our economy and stock market), and the fed is threatening to go into the clean room and sneeze in his face while giving him a dirty Sanchez (the equivalent of jacking interest rates and doing QT for a prolonged period). People are saying bullshit, that will kill him, you don't have the balls to do it. And the fed doesn't have the balls to do it. But the fed is walking closer and closer to the clean room and coughing louder and louder hoping the spectator screams ok ok stop you win, I surrender (burst the asset bubbles by selling, triggering unemployment and ultimately destroying money, reducing inflation). \n\nNormally the fed could just hold down the economy and give it a dirty Sanchez, forcing the issue, but normally the economy doesn't also have AIDs. The fed can only threaten a dirty Sanchez currently, so it will be interesting (terrifying) to see how this works out. If they can't get inflation under control like this, oh boy, that's going to be really bad, because they have no other options. They can raise and do QT for a bit, but eventually, they will cause a credit market \"issue\" (death spiral). They will need to reverse course to save the system at that point (money printer = set to infinite), but if inflation is still ripping, it will also break the system, more slowly in its own horrifying way...
