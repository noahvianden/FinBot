I can tell you that past performance is not a guarantee for future returns.\n\nEveryone loved target since 2020. However TGT was a dog prior to that - Bill Ackman failed at a turn around with his stake, they had a serious PoS hack that impacted the shareprice negatively in 2014 (wasn't as common back then as it is now so this was a big deal back then), they pulled out of Canada after bungling over there booking some 1B in losses (their inventory management in Canada was pathetic with channel checks stating that it was not uncommon to find shelves not restocked) and then finally the dark clouds of Amazon Prime destroying brick and mortar stores. \n\nTargets PE was always between 14 and 16 at the time with a dividend yield of 4% to 4.5% while growing dividends double digit and payout ratios under 50%. \n\nin 2015, they announced massive investments into IT which would be capital intensive and ROI showing only a years later. this was discounted by Wall st. due to the timelines. I believe it was 2017 that they announced a partnership with Shipt to enable faster ecommerce delivery. Things started turning around in 2019 when they the ecommerce segment start showing massive double digit growth. \n\nAt some point, Target turned from a brick and mortar to an ecommerce play so their multiples expanded significantly.\n\nSo target is a turnaround story. \n\nCostco on the other hand always commanded a premium because they had steady cashflow through membership fees (PE between 30 and 35 in the mid 2010s always).

Indeed the risk has increased but I'm not too worried as inflation is here to stay and miners will like demand higher prices to account for the inflation risk in the next 3-5 years as they built their mines.\n\n**Mines will run out**\n\nOnce uranium gets mined out of the ground, it's no longer in the ground.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/quai1p5it2t81.png?width=2133&format=png&auto=webp&s=17c0bf99f61763641dda4c2ca68f2270a60669cf\n\nPrices have to get high to incentivize existing mines to restart and even higher to incentivize exploration.\n\nSimilarly, you can model these as a lot of the publicly traded companies will report the expected remaining life time of their mines.\n\n**Increasing demand**\n\nA lot of countries are building new reactors. Here are some of the big ones.\n\nEU was having some luck with France leading the nuclear push in the EU taxonomy but things seemed to have quieten down.\n\nJapan, the real OG, are planning to turn nuclear plants back on due to rising energy prices and also RUSSIAN ENERGY, GO FUCK YOURSELF.\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/japan-power-stocks-rise-sharply-after-pm-s-comments-raise-hopes-for-nuclear-power-use-271649643323](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/japan-power-stocks-rise-sharply-after-pm-s-comments-raise-hopes-for-nuclear-power-use-271649643323)\n\nChina, has plans to build another 150 nuclear power plants by 2035. Previously, I wrote a [DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/UraniumSqueeze/comments/qmg343/a_political_take_on_chinas_shift_to_uranium/) about the political genius of pivoting to nuclear energy as there is ample supply that are China friendly. \n\nKazakhstan produces about 40% of the world's supply of the base form of U3O8.\n\nRussia is 1/3 of the world's capacity of converting U3O8 to UF6.\n\nRussia is 40% of the world's enrichment capacity.\n\n[https://theconversation.com/russias-energy-clout-doesnt-just-come-from-oil-and-gas-its-also-a-key-nuclear-supplier-179444](https://theconversation.com/russias-energy-clout-doesnt-just-come-from-oil-and-gas-its-also-a-key-nuclear-supplier-179444)\n\nChina is heavily pushing for electrifying of vehicles and a massive nuclear build out because they understand that reliance on oil means getting held by the balls by the US controlled middle east and that they can be easily blockaded. Going nuclear means energy security and we all know China will get something done when they want it to get done.\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-11-02/china-climate-goals-hinge-on-440-billion-nuclear-power-plan-to-rival-u-s](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-11-02/china-climate-goals-hinge-on-440-billion-nuclear-power-plan-to-rival-u-s)\n\n**Russian Sanctions**\n\nRussia fucked Ukraine so now America and Europe decides to sanction Russian nuclear. Remember how Russia is 40% of the world's enrichment capacity?\n\nTurns out, the enrichment process determines how effectively you can use the based U3O8. More enrichment means less U3O8 used (underfeeding) and vice versa (overfeeding).\n\n[https://twitter.com/quakes99/status/1071629544556126208?lang=en](https://twitter.com/quakes99/status/1071629544556126208?lang=en)\n\nYou can already see the effect of the ban through the nuclear supply chain.\n\n[https://twitter.com/quakes99/status/1510282906614173696](https://twitter.com/quakes99/status/1510282906614173696)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/so067gnhy2t81.png?width=685&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b2c62a5e34dcc056bb284f926e9531c66aaa542\n\n**Sprott Inc**\n\nSprott Inc is a global investment manager specializing in precious metals and real assets investing.\n\nTwo important products are the Sprott Physical Uranium Trust (SPUT) and the recently acquired North Shore Global Uranium Mining ETF.\n\nSPUT NAV has grown from 600M to 3.5B since 19 July 2021 till now.\n\nBelow is North Shore Global Uranium Mining ETF's NAV prior to acquisition by Sprott.  \n \n\n[Dated 7 April 2022](https://preview.redd.it/g2evmn3sz2t81.png?width=730&format=png&auto=webp&s=b6af78eeb04577b8d4f5baf065d81d88169a3ac9)\n\nImportant thing is that Sprott is a heavyweight and knows how to raise money for their products.\n\nWith both the physical trust and the ETF under their control, it's time for them to really ramp up capital acquisition.\n\nWithin a week of URNM's acquisition, Sprott filed the application for SPUT to be listed on the NYSE.\n\n[https://twitter.com/quakes99/status/1513646331893407745](https://twitter.com/quakes99/status/1513646331893407745)\n\n**How to play this**\n\nThe common narrative is that miners are a leveraged play on uranium spot prices.\n\nAssuming miner has an operating cost of $30/lb, a movement of spot prices from $40 to $60 would mean...\n\n50% increase in spot prices and 200% increase in miner earnings.\n\nIt's a correct line of thought but the issue comes in that a lot of these miners are 3-5 years from production. During this time, they will face inflation risk and ballooning capex costs. If they require further financing, they face taking on debt at less attractive rates or share issuance which will result in dilution.\n\nNext, the miners price in what they expect prices to hold at. Just because spot price hits $200/lb for 2 seconds and you managed to get one off in that time, doesn't mean that miners will price in $200/lb. The price has to hold for a significant time OR long term contracts have to be signed at those prices.\n\nLastly, a liquidity crunch from QT and a prolonged bear market might result in suppressed stock prices but reactors will continue running and there will still be demand for the uranium metal, propping prices up.\n\nThe two major producing companies Cameco and Kazatomprom both have their own issues.\n\nCameco runs the risk of a cash flow crunch if spot prices spike before they are able to ramp up production.\n\n[ https:\\/\\/imgur.com\\/a\\/uuqzayA ](https://preview.redd.it/fj6g1i0v33t81.png?width=734&format=png&auto=webp&s=98683825a6da1ca7eb220251710404959d03db76)\n\nKazatomprom is in Kazakhstan and they had a riot in January due to rising oil prices and income inequality. Guess what, food prices are rising and that typically comes with FREE SOCIAL INSTABILITY. \n\n**TLDR**\n\nThe uranium thesis is the only other thing that gets me hard but many miners are going to be negative cashflow for the next 3-5 years facing potential dilution, expensive debt and even bankruptcy.\n\nHence, the risk to reward seems better on physical uranium.\n\nMaybe it's because I laid off sugar for the past two days to type this out but the phrase \"risk management\" just popped up next to \"OH SHIT TO THE MOON\" in my dictionary.\n\n**Positions**\n\nCurrent positions: 1000 U.UN shares, 30K in Uranium ETF calls. 45k in Denison Mines.\n\nFuture Positions: Rotating out of my Uranium ETF calls, Denise Mines shares into a total 75% allocation in U.UN and 25% DCA in SOXS leaps. \n\n [https://imgur.com/a/CMlDHzH](https://imgur.com/a/CMlDHzH)", "id": "u1x2lq", "created_utc": 1649763740.0, "score": 220, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 82, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|24|**First Seen In WSB**|2 years ago\n**Total Comments**|272|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qy4gpl/426_dte_and_weaponizing_uranium/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6ra26/politics_cant_stop_gme_and_math_says_pt_1000/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/u1x2lq/uranium_neuron_firing_edition/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/t8354d/mental_gynamstic_russia_is_winning/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l17qso/lemons_were_meant_to_be_squeezed/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6qwu3/confirmation_bias_on_the_squeeze_pt_way_over_1k/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qo38ap/how_uranium_will_give_you_a_permahard_erection/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qo3avs/how_uranium_will_give_you_a_permahard_erection/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qo3da4/how_uranium_will_give_you_a_permahard_erection/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qo3g44/how_uranium_will_give_you_a_permahard_erection/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/u0be91/physical_uranium_the_ultimate_hedge/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/u0bfy4/physical_uranium_the_ultimate_hedge/) \n**Account Age**|6 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=u1x2lq)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=u1x2lq)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Nice write up !

Meaning that until a certain price level the demand (consumption) for uranium will not decrease if the uranium price goes significantly higher. The reason is that unenriched uranium (U3O8) only represents \\~5% of the total production cost of electricity from a nuclear reactor. So even if the uranium price would double from 62.25 USD/lb today the impact on the total production cost of electricity will be mimimal. On the other hand gas represents around 70% of the total production cost of electricity from a gas-fired power station, so when gas goes higher the impact on the totalproduction cost of electricity is significantly bigger!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2) The uranium supply and demand is impacted by secundary supply and secundary demand. The biggest part of the secundary supply comes from underfeeding during the enrichment. I'm not going to go to deep on that here, but underfeeding creates secundary supply of \"uranium\", while overfeeding creates secundary demand of \"uranium\" (UF6)\n\nToday we are evolving from underfeeding to overfeeding ==> **The impact is DOUBLE:** on the one hand secundary supply on which utilities counted on is disappearing, while on the other hand secundary demand is appearing, demand that wasn't planned by utilities!\n\nHere some more information on the latest impact in the nuclear fuel cycle (= mining, conversion, enrichment, fuel fabrication): [https://www.reddit.com/r/UraniumSqueeze/comments/tx2eub/the\\_nuclear\\_fuel\\_cycle\\_is\\_getting\\_more\\_and\\_more/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UraniumSqueeze/comments/tx2eub/the_nuclear_fuel_cycle_is_getting_more_and_more/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3) In the nuclear/uranium sector the main part of uranium transactions goes through LT contracts. Those LT contracts have been negotiated in waves in the past (big contracting cycle 2005-2008 (mainly driven by China), small contracting cycle 2010-2012). **Those LT contracts are coming to an end all together!!** \\--> A new multi-year contracting cycle has startedin 2021S2.\n\nHere are some more details on that:\n\n**Post of 1 year ago explaining the contracting cycles and the fact that existing LT contracts and many short term contracts are coming to an end all together, creating a huge new multi-year contracting cycle!**: [https://www.reddit.com/r/UraniumSqueeze/comments/mj8700/how\\_big\\_is\\_the\\_uranium\\_deficit\\_in\\_the\\_future/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UraniumSqueeze/comments/mj8700/how_big_is_the_uranium_deficit_in_the_future/)\n\nPost of 4 months ago: [https://www.reddit.com/r/UraniumSqueeze/comments/rgxe8t/paladin\\_energy\\_is\\_well\\_positioned\\_to\\_benefit\\_from/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UraniumSqueeze/comments/rgxe8t/paladin_energy_is_well_positioned_to_benefit_from/)\n\nI would not be surprised if the uranium spotprice reached 80 USD/lb in 2022. In 2023/2024 the uranium spot price will most likely significantly overschoot those 80 USD/lb.\n\nIn 2007 the uranium spotprice overschot the needed long term uranium price around 55 USD/lb to reach 134 USD/lb around July 2007.\n\nToday with all the inflation a stable \\~75USD/lb is needed to get the global uranium supply and demand back in equilibrium **a couple years later**.\n\n\"**A couple years later**\" means that when reaching a stable \\~75USD/lb, existing uranium mines in care-and-maintenance will need 12 to 24 months to restart the mining operations, while well advanced uranium projects will need years to evolve from a project to an producing mine!! It takes a lot of time to increase uranium production significantly!\n\n**BUT!!** Producers and developers need a stable **long term** 75 USD/lb price!! Because they will never sell the main part of their future production through the spotmarket. They need LT contracts to justify long term investments to restart or build the mine!). **The uranium spotprice is around 64 USD/lb today, but the LT price isn't!!**\n\nFor the long term price: [https://www.cameco.com/invest/markets/uranium-price](https://www.cameco.com/invest/markets/uranium-price)\n\n**End March 2022 the LT uranium price was only at 49 USD/lb. That's one of the reasons why a significant overschoot of the uranium spotprice above 75 USD/lb is expected.**\n\nNote: Exception in the developer category: **Global Atomic** is already building their DASA uranium mine (start construction end 2021, start mining end 2024, first uranium delivery early 2025), because DASA uranium project has an all-in sustaining cost of only 21.93 USD/lb U3O8. They did all their numbers with a 35 USD/lb uranium price, while the uranium price today is over 60 USD/lb!! And they have revenue from their 49% stake in a producing Zinc JV to finance construction of the DASA mine ==> No big capital raise needed like Nexgen Energy for instance.\n\nI think that we will reach a uranium spotprice beyond 150 USD/lb at a certain point (but that would be based on speculation, like in 2007, because like I said the sector only needs a stable long term \\~75 USD/lb price)\n\nI'm not going to sell my Sprott Physical Uranium Trust (and Yellow Cake) position at 75 USD/lb, because I want to enjoy a part of that suspected overshoot. I will gradually decrease my SPUT position: For instance 20% out around 85 USD/lb, 20% out around 105 USD/lb and so one ...\n\nThe uranium miners/developers/explorers react exponentially to the increase of the uranium spot and term price!! ==> multi-bagger potential\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4) Licence extensions of existing nuclear reactors have a much bigger impact on the uranium sector than most uranium investors think!!\n\nHere some information on that aspect: [https://www.reddit.com/r/UraniumSqueeze/comments/ths6ri/the\\_latest\\_signes\\_of\\_operational\\_license/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UraniumSqueeze/comments/ths6ri/the_latest_signes_of_operational_license/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n5) Significant future nuclear reactor constructions:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/UraniumSqueeze/comments/qmi1dx/an\\_overview\\_nuclear\\_renaissance\\_china\\_massive/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UraniumSqueeze/comments/qmi1dx/an_overview_nuclear_renaissance_china_massive/)\n\nNote: China builds reactors in 5 to 6 years time and on budget, not like in Europe and USA at the moment!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n6) How undervalued is the entire uranium sector at the moment?\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/UraniumSqueeze/comments/t45k8q/how\\_undervalued\\_is\\_the\\_entire\\_uranium\\_sector\\_at/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UraniumSqueeze/comments/t45k8q/how_undervalued_is_the_entire_uranium_sector_at/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n7) I'm invested in more than 25 different uranium companies + SPUT and Yellow Cake.\n\nMy 7 biggest uranium positions today are Global Atomic, Denison mines, Deep Yellow and Vimy Resources together, Energy Fuels, Fission Uranium Corp and Sprott Physical Uranium Trust.\n\nIf interested, there are different ways to get exposure to the uranium sector:\n\n\\- Sprott Physical Uranium Trust (U.UN on the TSX, SRUUF on US stock exchange): trust investing only in physical uranium. In my opinion, it's the safest way to get exposure to the uranium sector because here you don't have the mining related risks: [https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/physical-commodity-funds/uranium/](https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/physical-commodity-funds/uranium/)\n\n\\- URNM etf ( [https://urnmetf.com/urnm](https://urnmetf.com/urnm)) and HURA etf: well diversified and well balanced 100% pure uranium sector funds\n\n\\- URA etf and GCL (london): diversified 70% pure uranium sector funds\n\n\\- individual uranium companies: uranium producers (Cameco, Kazatomprom, Paladin Energy, ...) and well advanced uranium developers (Global Atomic, Denison Mines, Goviex Uranium, Fission Uranium Corp, ...)\n\nThis isn't financial advice.
