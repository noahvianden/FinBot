Blackberry QNX runs majority of the software on **every connected car produced**. To secure it from ransomware and other threats Blackberry recently integrated its **most ADVANCED Cylance ai engine** into it!!! Meaning the ai is running inside the CAR BB QNX operating system protecting against Ransomware and other threats! [here is the proof](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/blackberry-announces-qnx-integration-with-cylance-security-systems-at-ces-2020/)\n\nThe Blackberry QNX also has Blackberry Persona built into the software. It's basically a digital avatar of the user....meaning it can detect and identify the driver without any finger print or password. No need for car key or anything once deployed by car OEM. The car knows your settings and everything!!! \n\n[Blackberry Persona Proof](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/products/unified-endpoint-security/blackberry-persona)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(2019 list) List of companies running Blackberry QNX. Most of the design wins (>200 design wins) have been in recent last 2 years. Meaning the r**evenue is going to jump in few quarters** because it takes time to design the product and production. Minimum 18 months. **So each car produced will generate $25 minimum...50 million cars with QNX(includes recent china lead) is about 1.2billion pure revenue a year. The Ivy will generate about $10 per car a year...deployed across 175 million cars is about $1.75billion annually and growing.** \n\ncar list. \n\n[Car partnership from 2018](https://preview.redd.it/cs9nsmepfj571.png?width=743&format=png&auto=webp&s=99f8d985b4b377946668f353156c6482b29de46c)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey are leader in EV industry: Once Tesla joins, which they will, due to regulation requiring running ISO certified Operating system (Blackberry QNX) they will own 99% of EV industry:\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xh1ukbkoij571.png?width=679&format=png&auto=webp&s=3278e659ada19702038b0ced20b9e0b727d96deb\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Wallstreet has been shorting blackberry to frustrate the retailers that have found a diamond.
