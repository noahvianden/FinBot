{"title": "An alternative to dollar cost averaging into stocks: Retire in 5 years with LEAPs", "selftext": "Clarifications: \n\n1. Some people are claiming that I cherry-picked data by leveraging the last 5 years of raging bull market. I am aware that this was a particularly good time period for stocks, and have explicitly acknowledged this issue in the original post itself. This strat also works over the [life of data](https://www.quantconnect.com/docs/data-library/options) (**2010-2021)** that is available to me. This 11 year period includes the 2020 flash crash, Aug'11 bear market, 2015-16 China crash/US markets selloff, 2018 crypt0 crash, and 2020 covid crash. \n2. Testing over 2007-2008 would have been great, and I concur with many of you that if markets stayed flat over 2 years, this strat loses substantial capital. This is also acknowledged in the original post. I'm not claiming this to be some strat with [huuuge upside and very little downside](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJXLV_DMKa0), just an interesting way to deploy leverage. \n3. Backtests do not guarantee future success. They only prove that a strat would have worked in the past. This is true of backtests that are statistically significant AND of those that aren't. My philosophy is that if you're going to gamble, use all the data you have to optimize your odds, and do it as scientifically as possible. I'm working towards adding a hedging component. All research will be open-sourced. If you have any constructive ideas for reducing drawdowns/ruin probability and such please DM\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Tl;dr: DCA every month into index LEAPs instead of index funds to outperform the markets. Crazy right?**\n\n**Disclaimer: This isn't financial advice. I am not a finance professional.**\n\nWho this is for: This research is from the pov of salaried folks like me who are midway to FIRE, who have fixed income guaranteed for at least 2 years, and with the optionality to keep working for a bit longer if the strategy goes badly. Our goal is to advance retirement by aiming for higher than market *total* returns - not *risk adjusted* returns (hate that term by the way) or more correctly not *volatility adjusted* returns. If this doesn't describe you, this post won't be useful to you.\n\n\"Dollar cost average into index funds\" is the most non-controversial financial advice you can get. It has long been the gospel of bogleheads and other hands-off styles of investors and for a good reason: Stocks follow a Weiner process with positive drift. viz. Over the long term markets go up, and in the years when they go down they fall less than they gain in the years when they go up.\n\nThen the question must be asked - is there a way to leverage this.. loosely speaking.. \"guarantee\" of positive movement over the long term? What is the safest way to do so?\n\nI could think of 3 ways:\n\n1. Buy index funds on margin. This is well studied and [documented](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=5934). I personally dislike this approach because of interest rate risk, margin requirement change risk, flash crash risk. Besides the only broker which offers a reasonable margin rate (that the dividends on SPY will sufficiently pay for) is IBKR and it comes at the price of not doing margin calls. They'll sell your investments at the worst possible time. 110% long is the highest I am willing to go with this method.\n2. Levered ETFs - I am not knowledgeable on this subject but from what I understand they're not meant to be held long term due to contango and rebalancing. Please feel free to correct me or add color.\n3. Buy calls. Control the upside on 100x shares for less that the price of 100x underlying. This is the subject of this post\n\nResearch methodology:\n\nI backtested this approach with Quantconnect and found that buying 40 delta calls that expire at least 1 year out (LEAPs) every month and scaling in slowly over 2 years beats the market by 5:1. The approach is not without risks. Options are a wasting asset. The scenario in which it loses the entire capital invested is if the US stock markets behaved like Japan in the 90s.\n\nInvesting in stocks lump sum is preferable to DCA but it would be too risky with options. So we scale in slowly over 24 months, buying a fixed dollar amount worth of SPY LEAPs.\n\nLeverage is set to 1. We won't be borrowing money to buy calls. Margins calls are terrifying enough with equity. Built-in leverage is sufficient.\n\nNo stock picking, no market timing, no indicators, no hedging. Wake up once a month, find the expiration that's closest to 380 days from today, identify a 40 delta strike (slightly out of money) and buy a preset dollar amount worth. Do this for 2 years. Sell the call 2 weeks before expiry (avoids assignment, gamma risk, accelerated theta decay). After 2 years, stop adding more principal, just reinvest profits the same way as before. For example on June 1st 2021 we would have bought SPY220617C00445000@$194.\n\nWhy 40 delta? 2 weeks? 2 years? These were just common sense starting points. I'm sure you can fine-tune them but I did not want to risk overfitting the algorithm with additional parameters. OTM calls makes sense intuitively due to volatility skew and the fact that % moves are bigger. ITM calls are more expensive and if I wanted higher delta I'd just buy shares without expiry risk. SPY was chosen because it's as liquid as it gets. The algorithm is buying at ask and selling at bid (market orders). In practice we can try bidding lower/higher with a bit of patience but that's the least of our concerns.\n\nInb4 \"short term capital gain taxes\" - we choose expiry 380 days out + sell 2 weeks before expiry which means holding period always qualifies for LTCG treatment. This makes our approach comparable with \"buy and hold index\" or \"dollar cost average index\" on a pre as well as post tax basis.\n\nFinally because of the way the backtesting engine works, I had to seed the algorithm with $500,000 paper money and make $500,000/24 = 21k worth of a purchase each month. This means that in the first 2 years we're not fully invested. This cash drag understates the returns a bit but that's okay. If you calculate the TWR on invested capital by hand it will be even higher in practice so no harm done.\n\nBacktest was conducted over last 5 years (Jun'16 to Jun'21). Yes, this method is empirical, and the 5 years happened to be good for stockholders. But I don't have a crystal ball for the next 5 years and this is as scientific as it can get. The important question is whether this strategy has legs or are we paying too much premium to make money over a *sufficiently large and flexible* time period.\n\nResults:\n\n[https://ibb.co/r7wMfwY](https://ibb.co/r7wMfwY)\n\n[https://ibb.co/frswZJn](https://ibb.co/frswZJn)\n\n**Total return for DCA into LEAPs: 609.75%**\n\n**Total return for DCA into SPY shares: 154.49%** (benchmark#1)\n\n**Total return for lump sum SPY shares: 421/190-1 = 121.57%** (benchmark#2)\n\nWorst drawdown - surprisingly low 49.2%\n\nSharpe ratio - 1.23\n\nPSR - 50.4%\n\n(We don't give a shit about the last 2 metrics. We knew this was going to be volatile.)\n\nMy takeaway:\n\nUnless a calamity occurs and doesn't resolve itself for more than 5 years, this strategy will propel me towards an early retirement. I'm keeping all my current savings invested in an all weather portfolio, but the new money will buy LEAPs every month. If this works well, see you in walhalla. If this goes tits up, no biggie, keeping my job for 2 more years won't kill me. Biggest risk to implementing this strategy well is psychological. Human nature is to equate high win rates with better strategies rather than ones with higher, skewed expectancy. I fully expect some of these monthly purchases to go to zero, but hopefully the others will more than make up for the losses. So long as I don't shit my pants and keep buying that is..\n\nFuture research:\n\nExperiment with spreads, calendar spreads, diagonal spreads, active stock picking. Fine tuning deltas. Timing the purchases with low IV. Hedging with VIX, gold, bonds, T-bills..", "id": "nzw7to", "created_utc": 1623702627.0, "score": 121, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 99, "comments": [{"body": "  \nThis is a fine strategy. I've been doing this strategy for a long time now and it's been very good to me. I recommend this strategy to all young people I meet. I'm a little surprised you posted it here, as it's the opposite of r/wsb. This is a multi-decade strategy. If compound interest is the 8th wonder of the world, this strategy is compound interest on steroids. Once you fully grasp the strategy and see it in action, you will understand what it means to have money make money for you. This is a strategy that can build multi-generational wealth and makes you look at risk and time horizon a totally different way. Some thoughts:\n\n* The first decade is slow. It will pick up. The longer you put money into the strategy, the quicker it accelerates. Time is most definitely your friend here. You need to stay disciplined and still buy when market corrects. You will realize buying the dips will be the best thing you do. My 2020 purchases have been very good to me.\n* This strategy is not cheap, especially with SPY. For 2 year LEAPs, that's about 2-3k a month for 1 contract. That's a commitment to save/invest 3k a month.\n* I buy 2 year LEAPs at 40 delta. I started off with 40 delta and like I said, it's been good to me, so no reason to change/try to optimize. Like you said, it just makes sense. Slightly OTM. The thing is, the delta doesn't mean much when it's 2 years out. No one can predict the future. It doesn't mean you have 60% chance of losing your money.\n* There will be months where your strike will be worthless. However, the months you are ITM more than make up the loss. The worst condition for this strategy is sideways. As long as the market goes up and down, there will be strikes that are ITM. So it actually doesn't matter if market makes new high or not. The market doesn't stay sideways for the entire 2 years. People that are talking about recession don\u2019t really understand the strategy. If the market drops, 40 delta means your strike is also lower. You move with the market. 2008/2009 means 40 delta you bought back in 2006/2007. So yes, the 2007 was a wasted year. However, whatever you bought in 2008 onwards, you would have made bank in 2010. People are criticizing this strategy as if it was riskless. There is no such thing as riskless in the market. Because of leverage (options), you will not be worst off than DCA in underlying. You are always buying low and selling high. You will always be catching the lows. People criticizing the strategy aren\u2019t comparing it to a benchmark. They\u2019re looking to time the market and never lose. This in itself is a fallacy.\n* I stick with Jan expiry; makes the process easier and keeps it simple. Specifically, I buy Jan 2023 until Nov 2021. On Dec 2021, I buy the Jan 2024 expiry. You end up with a ladder of strikes. I buy the same number of contracts, so it's not truly DCA in the sense it's not a fixed dollar amount per month. You won't be able to buy a fixed dollar amount like in stocks. I also buy 2nd Friday of the month. 3rd Friday of the month is when monthlies expire, so a bit more volatility. Ultimately, it doesn't really matter, because you're buying something 2 years out, but it makes sense to buy at the same time each month. Additionally, each subsequent month costs approximately the same/little bit less. Even though you\u2019re buying at 40 delta, you\u2019re paying for less time (theta) but IV might be higher/lower.\n* First 2 years you're just buying. Like I said, it starts off slow. Come Dec, when your first set of purchases is about to expire, you budget what you need for the upcoming year. Any money remaining, you buy the actual shares. These shares are basically your profit, and cost is effectively 0. Put these on DRIP. It also means you will have 11 months worth of money in cash after December that you then drawdown.\n* You start buying again with the money you cashed out from your first set. If you keep on adding money, in theory, you can now buy double the contracts that you did in the first 2 years.\n* Rinse and repeat. Take the profit out and convert into actual shares. Initially, it won't be many shares, but if you stick to it, the number of shares you buy each year will grow. \n* Once you've accumulated some shares, you can start using margin and buy more LEAPs. Use margin wisely. The last thing you want to happen is getting margin called and your options forced sold. Don't get greedy.\n* SPY is a great choice. This strategy works best for index.

By going to 80 delta, you're exchanging leverage for safety.
