{"title": "Anyone else feel like they have missed endless opportunities so far?", "selftext": "I\u2019m 25, and recently I\u2019ve been giving a lot of thought to just how many amazing opportunities on the stock market I\u2019ve missed over the years. The once-in-a-lifetime bull run of mid to late 2020 and early 2021, much earlier thoughts of investing in Apple back in 2010/2011, the fact I\u2019ve been interested in Tesla and SpaceX and basically anything Elon Musk does since its inception yet somehow never gave any thought to buying TSLA stock early. All missed, and I have to admit it\u2019s grating on me a little bit.\n\nI\u2019ve also heard a lot of talk that the stock market is probably going to be pretty stagnant overall over the next decade, so even if I decided it was a wise idea to park most of my money in a couple of relatively S&P500 ETFs and leave it it probably won\u2019t make anything. Not that I\u2019m satisfied with 5% annual return anyway, because I\u2019m not. Not that I want to be a complete gambler either, but I\u2019d rather take moderate risks for moderately higher returns than end up being too old to get the good of any small fortune I make from low-risk long-term investing. Say what you like about the folks at WSB but there\u2019s no doubt a significant amount of folks there have made a lot of money, at times very quickly, albeit with a lot of risk.\n\nThe more I think about it the more I think what I\u2019m really looking for is not the next Apple or Tesla, but the next Steve Jobs or Elon Musk. Even back in 2012 it was obvious to me that SpaceX and Tesla were going to do well, and it was obvious to everyone that Apple was already doing well, and that it would continue to do so. Today however I see no such companies. I see smaller stocks that I like the look of, being in industries I think MIGHT be big in the future and that I think are very important (nuclear thorium, battery recycling etc.), but without a powerful CEO like Musk or Branson or Gates I can\u2019t see them getting the name recognition or making the 10x, 50x, 100x or 500x returns that early investors in companies like Apple or Tesla or Microsoft have so far realised. The companies I can see doing well in the future seem to be the ones that are already too big to make any sort of meaningful return in the short to medium term (i.e the next 10-15 years). There\u2019s also the crypto market I suppose but that seems to be a place where if you didn\u2019t get in before you hear the news then you are too late.\n\nAnyone else like this? If so, how did you get over it?\n\nEDIT: oh my, my first award on Reddit.

It will touch on the macroeconomic and political landscape of the steel industry (**hint:** it's fantastic), as well as Ternium's financials, operational history, outlook, and risk profile.\n\n# If you want a quick and dirty of the case for Ternium (TX), here you go:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. **Pricing Power:**   \nSteel prices have **doubled or tripled in the past year** across various finished products; **vertically integrated steel companies** that mine their own iron ore, make their own casting products and convert those into high-margin finished steel for manufacturers currently have a veritable license to print money in this environment. **Ternium checks all these boxes, and is** [**making shitton of money because of it.**](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TX/ternium-sa/net-income) Additionally, Ternium enjoys unfettered access to the favorably-priced North American steel market due to USMCA exemptions from [TEA Section 232 Tariffs](https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/metals/030421-section-232-tariffs-on-steel-aluminum-effective-us-commerce-secretary), all while reaping the lower operating costs associated with labor and capital expenditures in Latin America.  \n\n2. **Pricing Longevity:**  \n**Those high steel prices are not going anywhere soon** \\- even as other commodities like lumber show signs of weakness.

In late April they [slashed their tax incentives](https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/metals/042821-china-removes-vat-rebate-on-steel-exports-cuts-tax-on-raw-material-imports-to-zero) for steel exports, and in late May began floating rumors of a new [tax on exports](https://www.metalbulletin.com/Article/3990727/FOCUS-What-Chinas-possible-new-steel-export-taxes-mean-for-global-ferrous-industry.html) \\- a complete reversal of the economic policy which has cemented China as the world's largest steel provider. Domestic markets outside of China will struggle immensely to replace missing Chinese capacity.  \n\n3. **Increasing Market Share:**  \n**Ternium is one of only two North American companies** (the other being STLD) bringing new capacity online to capture market share during this pricing spike; **their** [**Pesqueria Mill**](https://investors.ternium.com/English/ternium/featured-stories/featured-stories-details/2020/New-investment-program-A-logical-next-step-after-the-integration-of-the-Rio-de-Janeiro-facility-to-Terniums-industrial-system/default.aspx) **saw the rollout of its first hot rolled coil production ahead of schedule last month**. Located 90 Miles from the Texas border, this mill is expected to produce annual capacity totaling 7 Million tons of shipped steel across several of the industry's highest-margin products, and provides convenient market access to the American Southwest and Mexico's manufacturing market.  \n\n4. **Fundamentally Undervalued:**  \n**Ternium's share price** has been beaten up due to perceived geopolitical risk in the Latin American states it operates in. Because of this, Ternium is currently trading at both the lowest F**orward (3.5) and** [**Historic (4.99) P/E ratios**](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TX/ternium-sa/pe-ratio) in the industry, all while having the [**highest industry EPS**](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TX/ternium-sa/eps-earnings-per-share-diluted)**,** [**lowest Price/Book ratio**](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TX/ternium-sa/price-book)**,** [**lowest Debt/Equity Ratio**](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TX/ternium-sa/debt-equity-ratio)**, and highest** [**Return on Equity**](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TX/ternium-sa/roe). **It currently trades below the book value of its hard assets.** It is without a doubt the most undervalued steel company in the midst of a historic industry cycle.  \n\n5. **Market Mechanics:**  \n**Ternium is an extremely low-volume stock.** Why? Because it's a Mexican steel company - no one thinks about Mexican steel companies.It's **100-day Average Volume sits at just 762,314**. Compare this to it its other American and South American mid-cap steel peers:\n   1. NUE - **3,502,597**\n   2. CLF - **23,576,139**\n   3. SID - **4,119,684**\n   4. GGB - **15,436,760**\n   5.

The Rocca's have not filed with the SEC since [June of last year](https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-20-015765/) (and additionally have not updated their ownership stake in their monthly [investor slide decks](https://s2.q4cdn.com/156255844/files/doc_presentations/2021/Ternium-2021-05.pdf)).This indicates that the ADR's ([American Depository Receipts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/adr.asp)) actively being traded on the NYSE account for only 24% of the company's available market cap (2% are held in treasury shares by the company).**All this is to say** that when the entire steel industry reports their best quarters in history over the next two months, **increased inflows have the potential to rocket Ternium's share price relative to its higher-volume peers.**\n\n**That's the TL:DR**. Now, on to the meat and potatoes.\n\n# The Commodity Landscape\n\nThe trajectory of the current commodity bull run is the subject of debate amongst analysts. Many widely believed to be transient - largely the result of hiccups in the supply chain post-covid, compounded by economies and demand scaling back up quicker than expected.\n\nHowever, the market reacts and follows even temporary spikes in commodity pricing. Commodity producers/growers/miners typically have fairly fixed overhead costs, so when windfalls in pricing come their way, their net income skyrockets. This has been reflected in commodity companies' share prices, particularly since November, when speculative tech, biopharma, renewables, and the other beneficiaries of the 2020 bull run that **were not tethered to fundamentals** began to show their first signs of weakness in anticipation of the impending economic reopening.\n\nMost analysts do not expect this commodity run to last too deeply into 2022, and for many commodities, I would agree. Lumber so far is following this trend: after skyrocketing on the back of record housing demand and stocking shortages during the pandemic, it has recently began it's [inevitable correction](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-18/plunge-in-lumber-contracts-signals-turning-point-for-wood-rally) following a [13% drop in new-housing starts](https://www.census.gov/construction/nrc/index.html?utm_campaign=&utm_content=&utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery) between March and April.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Ouch](https://preview.redd.it/whp833cm6r571.png?width=674&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2e95be3bdfec04aa59ac17ab36e40213be0730a)\n\n# What Commodity's High pricing and High Demand is Not Transient Might you Ask? Steel.\n\n**US Hot Rolled Coil (HRC),** a benchmark steel product used in the production of blanks for cars, farm and industrial equipment, white goods, railcars, doors, shelving, and tons of other stuff, has risen over [300% in the past year](https://www.thefabricator.com/thefabricator/blog/metalsmaterials/steel-prices-reach-levels-not-seen-since-2008) from lows of $440/ton to all time highs above $1600/ton. Other finished steel products like cold rolled coil, tubular steel, and semi-finished casting products like billet have seen similar price increases.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Killer chart title by S&P Global. Who said commodities reporting had to be boring?](https://preview.redd.it/rw11g65o6r571.jpg?width=560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6956b4d7a21483a7e85147b370065ffbf79aeacf)\n\nThe narrative surrounding the longevity of this steel pricing [is starting to change](https://fortune.com/2021/06/14/steel-prices-going-up-surge-2022/) in the industry's favor. Just this morning, [JP Morgan issued increased price targets](https://www.barrons.com/articles/sell-u-s-steel-because-other-steel-stocks-are-better-bets-analyst-says-51623865736?siteid=yhoof2) across the sector in light of the stability in high pricing. It is my opinion that prices will likely soften slightly in 2022 as supply catches up with demand to a **moderate degree**, but will remain elevated between $1000-1200 due to the following:\n\n**1)** [**Demand is expected to increase**](https://www.worldsteel.org/steel-by-topic/statistics/short-range-outlook.html) **by 5.8% globally this year and an additional 2.8% the following year by the World Steel Association**.\n\nAlbeit, that is after a contraction in demand during 2020 - however, the point is that demand isn't going anywhere, and it will probably be higher than forecasted in the coming years.\n\n**Why's that?**\n\nWhat do governments do to stimulate their economies when unemployment remains elevated, and continued monetary stimulus runs the risk of spiking inflation (I.E., where we're at now)?\n\n**They use infrastructure spending as stimulus.**\n\nGrid upgrades, turbine and PV panel installs, bridge and rail improvements, and EV production/purchasing incentives are all ideas being floated by governments to combat climate change and reenergize economic activity - this is already coming to fruition in China, the US, and plenty of other countries ([1](https://prospect.org/politics/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-infrastructure-bills/), [2](https://indianexpress.com/article/world/g7-rivals-china-with-grand-infrastructure-plan-7356564/), [3](https://www.china-briefing.com/news/how-foreign-technology-investors-benefit-from-chinas-new-infrastructure-plan/), [4](https://www.hklaw.com/en/insights/publications/2020/10/mexican-government-announces-us145m-infrastructure-plan), [5](https://www.iadb.org/en/news/infrastructure-transformation-will-generate-big-windfall-latin-america-and-caribbean), [6](https://www.bnamericas.com/en/analysis/brazil-putting-final-touches-on-major-infrastructure-plan), [7](https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/d3e77637-a963-11eb-9585-01aa75ed71a1/language-en)).\n\n**2) The Steel industry has consolidated, remaining players are wary of risks, and production capacity has been permanently shuttered.**\n\nIn the past the steel industry has fallen prey to over-producing when times are good and prices are high, with the eventual effect of glutting supply and gouging their own margins. However, the industry has been consolidating into fewer hands, and CEO's have been vocal about keeping margins high even if it means keeping production capacity offline.\n\nAs one example in the US, Cleveland Cliffs (CLF) recently acquired both [ArcelorMittal USA](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cleveland-cliffs-clf-wraps-arcelormittal-174505849.html) and [AK Steel](http://www.clevelandcliffs.com/English/news-center/news-releases/news-releases-details/2020/Cleveland-Cliffs-Completes-Acquisition-of-AK-Steel/default.aspx), taking two primary players off the map and becoming the second largest steel producer in the US. In a prudent bid at ensuring sustainable long-term profitability over short-term reward, they are leaving 2 of their 10 available plants shuttered (discussed by CEO Lourenco Goncalves in [last quarter's earnings call](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/04/22/cleveland-cliffs-clf-q1-2021-earnings-call-transcr/)).\n\nAbroad, Sanjeev Gupta's Steel conglomerate GFG Alliance is [on the verge of collapse](https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/first-parts-of-billionaire-sanjeev-gupta-s-steel-empire-headed-for-bankruptcy-11618542117896.html), leaving considerable assets up for grabs by other players there - ArcelorMittal, the largest steel producer ex-China, [has already put in a bid for their French assets.](https://www.reuters.com/business/eu-decide-by-july-9-arcelormittal-bid-liberty-steel-france-2021-06-08/)\n\n3) **Inflation**\n\nAs mentioned above, the Fed [**finally admitted today**](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/16/fed-holds-rates-steady-but-raises-inflation-expectations-sharply-and-makes-no-mention-of-taper.html) that inflation might (***read***\\*: will)\\* be more of a problem than they've been indicating. Again, See [**this interview**](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/14/paul-tudor-jones-says-bet-heavily-on-every-inflation-trade-if-fed-keeps-ignoring-higher-prices.html) for some fun commentary on how the big fish are likely to react react in the coming months. [Commodities](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/05/021605.asp) will lead the pack in inflationary environments, and the steel industry has a ton of tailwinds.\n\n4) **Changes in Chinese Export Policy**\n\n* **Decreases in Chinese steel exports**  have already begun due to the [tightening of pollution controls](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/china-to-tighten-steel-capacity-swap-controls-from-june-1-2021-05-06) and [removal of tax rebates](https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/metals/042821-china-removes-vat-rebate-on-steel-exports-cuts-tax-on-raw-material-imports-to-zero) for exports.\n   * This point is **HUGE.** China accounts for more than [50% of global steel production](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/visualizing-50-years-of-global-steel-production/) **and 20% of the export market -** They have been suppressing global steel prices via glutting supply for the last 12 years, made possible by their notoriously relaxed environmental laws and substantial tax rebates for exported steel products.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[How's that for market share?](https://preview.redd.it/psxqihsr6r571.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6e58d99125f5671634910f94198909a3db9988e5)\n\n* However, Chinese trade policy has recently completely 180'd in this regard. **There is no conceivable way** that producers will be able to make up for the void in supply left by a partial Chinese departure from the export market.\n   * Additionally, the approaching 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing will likely be preceded by industrial output restrictions similar to those [prior to 2008's Summer Olympics](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-olympics-closures-factbox/factbox-factories-shut-for-blue-sky-for-beijing-olympics-idUSSHA32043020080723), further depleting Chinese steel available for export.

TX -  **762,314**.\n   2. NUE - **3,502,597**\n   3. CLF - **23,576,139**\n   4. SID - **4,119,684**\n   5. GGB - **15,436,760**\n   6. STLD- **2,384,091**This, combined with the relatively low percentage of Ternium's market cap that trades publicly as ADR's (24%), means **heavy inflows have the potential to move Ternium's share price faster than it's peers -** and heavy inflows are coming\\*\\*.\\*\\*A number of Steel companies are going to **report their best earnings of all time** this quarter; Ternium will be one of them. STLD and NUE released adjusted Q2  guidance today; if theirs was anything to go off, Ternium will destroy Q2 (links to their updates [here](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-stld-earnings-guidance-2021-06-2-3/) and [here](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nyse-nue-earnings-guidance-2021-06-2-3/)).It is my opinion that the bevy of incredible earnings combined with **forward guidance projecting the longevity of this cycle** will shift the popular narrative for steel. Once this happens \\*\\*the industry will see a heavy inflow of volume as one of the safest commodity sectors to be in during an inflationary period with an uncertain timeline.\\*\\*Steel companies' share prices will begin to divorce from commodity indexes, and the cream will rise to the top. Ternium is creamy.\n\n\\*\\*Institutional Ownership:\\*\\*Institutions reporting an ownership stake in Ternium stayed relatively stable between 4Q2020 and 1Q2021. **Several notable investors increased** their stake in Q12021, including Citigroup, JP Morgan, Bank of America, Blackrock, Goldman Sachs, Deutsche bank, The Canadian Government's Pension Plan, The Royal Bank of Canada... it goes on. [Source.](https://whalewisdom.com/stock/tx)\n\nInstitutional inflows probably stayed stable for obvious reasons: early investors deleveraging their risk following Ternium's 200%+ rise from the pandemic lows balanced out with those recognizing the early innings of a steel boom. Of particular note - The Rocca's have not adjusted their stake in Ternium since [June of last year](https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-20-015765/).\n\nIt's clear that plenty of investors are reducing their stake based on recent price action - let's look at why.\n\n# Risks:\n\n* **Currency Risk**\n   * Ternium operates in developing countries with currencies historically less stable than the dollar. However, 75% of Ternium's steel shipments (and the vast majority of their High-Margin sales) are in countries with stable or appreciating currencies - the USA, Brazil and Mexico.In fact, Mexico and Brazil's currencies have both been appreciating relative to the dollar since March, and [will likely continue to do so.](https://www.cmegroup.com/education/featured-reports/mexican-stirs-price-upside-rates-risk.html#) Both nation's central banks have already shown tighter monetary policy than the US in the COVID landscape, and the Fed's meeting today all but confirmed this will continue.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Ternium's 2020 Steel Shipment Allocations by Country\\/Region.](https://preview.redd.it/thmu1qg57r571.png?width=1079&format=png&auto=webp&s=6ec729f6adfb34fe9e4bd574dd8af1d79911edc3)\n\n* Ternium ships the remaining 25% of their steel to Argentina, Chile, Peru, Venezuela, and other countries institutional investors have largely shunned recently. The currency risk in these countries is certainly more serious.\n   * However, exposure to the aforementioned countries hasn't kept them from being extremely profitable in the past - even during periods when their primary market's currency's (**Mexico and Brazil**) were depreciating (See Ternium's 2017/18 [earnings](https://s2.q4cdn.com/156255844/files/doc_financials/quarterly/PR-Ternium-1Q18-final.pdf) and share price performance).\n* **Exposure to Unstable Sociopolitical Environments**\n   * Aside from the general market dumping, This is likely the crux behind Ternium's recent price action. Some of the Mexican states Ternium operates in are exposed to substantial civil unrest and political violence.In particular, the state of Michoacan, where Ternium's subsidiary [Las Encinas SA](https://www.bnamericas.com/en/company-profile/las-encinas-sa-de-cv-las-encinas) operates their Aquila Mine, saw a [substantial spike in violence](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/apr/20/mexico-violence-gangs-cartels-criminal-elections) leading up to Mexico's June 6th election as cartels fought to influence the results.But don't just take my word for it - here it is straight from their [20-F](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001342874/9a1d9da4-87ff-484c-b50a-6ec71e90953e.pdf):\"*In recent years, there have been high incidences of violence and crime related to drug trafficking in Mexico, including the Monterrey area in Nuevo Le\u00f3n, where Ternium's main facilities are located, and Michoac\u00e1n, where some of Ternium's mining facilities are placed. Although the Mexican government has implemented various security measures and has strengthened its military and police forces, drug-related crime continues to exist in Mexico. Security issues could affect Ternium's day-to-day operations and could also result in an economic slowdown, reducing domestic demand for its products and thereby having an adverse effect on Ternium's business. A deterioration of the security situation could result in significant obstacles or additional costs to the imple*mentation of growth plans in Mexico, including delays in the completion of capital expenditures.\"\n   * **My opinion is that this selloff will turn out to be overblown.** Cartel-influenced political unrest is a fact of life in Mexico, and the runup to these elections was in fact [less bloody than 2018's.](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/26/more-than-100-politicians-murdered-in-mexico-ahead-of-election.html) With the election behind us, the Mexican news cycle will likely revert to normal.\n   * Ternium also operates in relatively unstable sociopolitical environments outside of Mexico, most notably Venezuela. Luckily, in 2009 the [Venezuelan government purchased all but 10%](https://venezuelanalysis.com/news/4432) of Ternium's stake in the their largest Venezuelan steel operation, SIDOR, for $1.97 Billion. This greatly reduced their assets at risk in the region.\n* The Risk of Tariff Removals\n   * Additionally, Ternium faces the same general risks that any steel producer does in this environment. **There is some speculation that removal of the TEA Section 232 tariffs would impact their pricing power in the US.** This is unlikely, as steel prices and mill backlogs [are at record highs across the globe](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-11/steel-s-massive-rally-is-hitting-all-parts-of-the-global-economy) \\- the European and Asian markets would not have sufficient export supply to depress North American prices, especially not with China stepping back from the picture.Even if the Asian and European markets did have the capacity to export to the Americas in meaningful numbers, they wouldn't/t be able to get it their without charging comparably high prices. **Container shipping rates** [**have tripled in the past year, and dry bulk has taken off as well.**](http://freightwaves.com) **There is no** [**current end in sight**](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/why-stratospheric-container-rates-could-rocket-even-higher) **to these shipping hikes.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[HARPEX's Container Index. Probably not a bad idea to invest in container as well.](https://preview.redd.it/jgz4kr2b7r571.png?width=519&format=png&auto=webp&s=815a97624766a2538f812cf6d5f55c927b9d919e)\n\nThe [Fleet-to-Orderbook](https://splash247.com/container-shippings-orderbook-to-fleet-ratio-rates-up-to-15/) ratio in container shipping is also at it's highest since the early 2010's - and it will take time to bring on new capacity onboard.  \n\n\n[Bogging up the steel pipeline - One decommissioned ship at a time.](https://preview.redd.it/p2h8ejje7r571.jpg?width=768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cd251a3a6345e2db5b72cc7fae8dd539eb880503)\n\n# Closing Thoughts:\n\nThe current environment looks exceptionally favorable for the steel industry over the next few years. The Covid-19 Pandemic precipitated a prefect storm of increased demand, record inventory lows, industry consolidation, and shipping bottlenecks that promise to keep steel pricing high for the foreseeable future. So long as China doesn't decide to abruptly walk back its new trade and pollution policies, the global steel supply / demand imbalance will remain overwhelmingly in producer's favor. **Ternium has demonstrated its ability to be profitable and pay dividends in environments** **far less favorable than this one,** **and I think it presents an incredible buying opportunity in the wake of political unrest in Mexico.**\n\n**Positions:**\n\n20% of my accounts are in November 42c and 60c's - 42's for the liquidity and 60's because I got them cheap after rebalancing my portfolio this week. Ternium's options are pretty illiquid compared to the higher volume/ bigger cap stuff, so be careful not to get caught in a bad bid/ask spread. I plan to roll them out on a green day whenever longer-dated calls become available on the chain.\n\nI may also be buying shares dependent on the guidance given at Q2's earnings.\n\nFor many of the same reasons listed above, I also believe that $STLD (Steel Dynamics), $NUE (Nucor), $CLF (Cleveland Cliffs), $SID (Companhia Siderurgica Nacional), $PKX (POSCO), $AMKBY (Maersk), $DAC (Danaos) and $ZIM (Zim) are good buys. I have call options in all but NUE, PKX, AMKBY, and DAC.\n\nThoughts and feedback are encouraged - Happy investing everybody, don't lose your wife's retirement.", "id": "o1oikc", "created_utc": 1623904386.0, "score": 205, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 89, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 43, "replies": [{"body": "Added /u/PumpernickelandBi as an approved submitter.

Saying something is memeable 'ItS a PlAnE cOmPaNy its LITERALLY tAkInG oFf Lol' or  'iT rHyMEs wItH YOLO' is not DD. They might spike up but they will fall down. I've been around since retards yolod their life savings on Riteaid, if I post about a stock here I'm holding it for the long term because the chart will go up. [Yesterday I posted about $GOEV,](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o0k89j/car_wars_episode_ev_a_canoo_hope_why_goev_can_be/) while it took a hit from its high  it's still up over 10% from the post and I expect it to continue growing, it's a solid company with good fundamentals and everything I wrote about it holds up, same for $ASO. \n\n**What is $ASO?** \n\nASO or Academy Sports + Outdoors is a sporting goods store that recently IPO'd and has not stopped it's steady traversal upwards since. With new institutional backing and investors plus unmatched earnings for its sector and a nice short float, I believe this stock has one of the brightest futures on this sub and it's JUST starting to get noticed.\n\n**First things first, short interest!** \n\nEverybody likes a good *word that rhymes with fort sneeze*, $ASO short interest is currently 22% of the float. Compare that to their 1 mo 3mo or 1 yr chart and you can see that the shorts have CONSISTENTLY been BTFO. This will keep happening and analysts agree, it is rated BUY by every major analyst from barchart to fidelity to nasdaq. It's honestly a mystery why no one here is paying attention to it but once it starts  flying it wont stop until it hits $60-$70 where it belongs. Along with a **small market cap** this will move the stock quickly.  \n\n**Unusual options activity** - Look at the option flow for the [past week](https://i.postimg.cc/02q48KLt/bullish-call-flow.png) and [month,](https://i.postimg.cc/fyHSg9Xw/bullish-call-flow-1-month.png) **100% bullish**, this has heavy implications since its actually at a 5% dip over the past week. A heavy influx of buying could potentially cause a gamma sq for this Friday as options writers (and theres\u2019 been a lot of them) have to cover. [For more on a **gamma sq** look at this post by u/hyptisx where he did some math for it to happen by **tomorrow**](https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o14jei/aso_this_week/) More unusual options via Nasdaq; [\u201cASO options are showing a volume of 17,370 contracts thus far today. That number of contracts represents approximately 1.7 million underlying shares, working out to a sizeable 75.7% of ASO's average daily trading volume over the past month, of 2.3 million shares. Particularly high volume was seen for the $40 strike call option expiring June 18, 2021, with 4,854 contracts trading so far today, representing approximately 485,400 underlying shares of ASO.\u201d](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/noteworthy-tuesday-option-activity%3A-rapt-aso-scco-2021-06-15)\n\n**Bubbling Sentiment on wsb** - $ASO doesn't need wsb to take off, it's going to do that based off solid fundamentals but it can get started much earlier if the word spreads. It has already begun due to multiple good DD's like [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nwysob/aso_your_yolos_dont_have_to_be_retardeda/) [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nvg2py/aso_just_chris_brownd_earnings_has_a_si_of_225/) and [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o0udtf/now_that_shit_has_somewhat_calmed_down_here_lets/) amongst other. You\u2019ve heard murmurs on the daily thread, don\u2019t ignore it and get mad later, It will be on the top of the FOMO list soon enough.\n\n**Low implied volatility** - This means July calls are still cheap for apes with plenty of time to reach them. June for a pure YOLO.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nNow on to the stuff you probably don\u2019t care about but should because it\u2019s the difference between stocks that crash and ones that don\u2019t. \n\n**Long Term and Fundamentals** \n\nLOOK AT THAT FUCKIN P/E. $ASO has blown earnings out of the water pretty consistently but last quarter was their best yet. With a **P/E of 10** (which makes this stock insanely undervalued) they currently have a forecasted growth of near **triple for 2022** Like I said earlier **every** analyst says this is a buy, stop falling for overpriced stocks with no fundamentals, $ASO has solid earnings and a terrific debt position. \n\n**Earnings** Earnings were absolutely blown out of the water this last quarter:\n\n- Adjusted income of $182.5 million vs Q1 2020 $400,000 income \n\n- EPS estimate of 0.84 vs **actual eps of 1.89**\n   \n- Revenues up 40% year over the year to $1.6 billion with an estimated 1.51 Billion expected to a **1.58 billion actual** \n\n**Charts/Technicals**\n\nHere are some links that you should check out if you like stats. Some of them are from the /u/birbigd99 DD post which was very informative. \n\n[Comprehensive DD by Refinitiv](https://www.scribd.com/document/511345009/ASO-DD)\n\n[Profit Margin](https://preview.redd.it/z3znha6kzh471.png?width=1207&format=png&auto=webp&s=577bdce2415b6317c94c72d7a4bca906bed474cb)\n\n[Price targets and Analyst ratings](https://preview.redd.it/m7d8xn7ibj471.png?width=974&format=png&auto=webp&s=e46010163543da2e344370cde66f0d1ee887811f)\n\n[For you TA retards, ever see a healthier chart?](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ASO)\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**IN CONCLUSION** \n\n$ASO is long term consistent winning stock with short term potential for a huge take off. The only reason it's low at the moment is because it's new and retail hasn't really caught on to it but that's starting to change, get in while you can boys. \n\n**I am not a financial advisor, please do your research.

{"title": "$CORN for the Apes!", "selftext": " Time for us Apes to feast on some **$CORN \ud83c\udf3d\ud83d\ude80**\n\n**TLDR:**\n\n* **Major global drought, buy $CORN potential >50% pop in 2 months.**\n* Significant drought in the Midwest/Grain belt, similar to 2012\n* Drought in Brazil\n* Increased Demand globally, especially China\n* Current price increase in corn is from general commodity rally and increased global demand, not supply concerns from the drought.\n\n**Preface:**\n\nAfter talking with family in Iowa about how abnormally hot it has been there, and they mentioned how the corn isn't even growing. Just curious, I thought I would look into how bad the corn growing really was. Surprisingly the drought in the Midwest is as bad and potentially worse than the 2012 drought that occurred in the Midwest that drove up corn prices 65% from $5.06 on June 14th 2012 price to $8.38 on August 21st 2012. Additionally the drought on the West coast is the worst in history.\n\n**US Corn Production:**\n\nThe majority of corn in the US is produced in the Midwest/High Plains, like most of us would expect.\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.cropprophet.com\\/what-state-produces-the-most-corn\\/ ](https://preview.redd.it/h4wwdpt51v571.png?width=300&format=png&auto=webp&s=547c832828c117aadb66dd46fa074256172ef640)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.cropprophet.com\\/what-state-produces-the-most-corn\\/ ](https://preview.redd.it/jsmiaje71v571.png?width=362&format=png&auto=webp&s=245bf5bc12329bbf4380dbb77d5d47f8cc296d66)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSurprisingly though the Western states actually have the highest corn yield per acre. But the Midwest has significantly more land allocated to Corn than the West resulting in more total crop production in the Midwest. (Crop yield is the amount of crop harvested per area of land.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.cropprophet.com\\/what-state-produces-the-most-corn\\/ ](https://preview.redd.it/0ea12t091v571.png?width=300&format=png&auto=webp&s=57b1db7a6b41ad765495bd5cc1435dc0a4da2868)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Droughts in the US:**\n\nThe drought in the West is very severe and expanding into the Midwest.

If a rain storm occurs in Iowa then it went through Nebraska and most likely kept going through Illinois, hitting three of the largest corn yielding states or 44% of the USA's corn yield, 6.2 billion bushels in 2020.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o8ommhcy1v571.png?width=774&format=png&auto=webp&s=0001f42d43433a51089b25f7667356e370fd898e\n\nLooking at June 2021 vs June 2012 the highs (thick Red line vs thin red lines) the highs have been on avg. 5 degrees higher and the lows (blue lines) have been 4 degrees higher. Rain has been -2.12\" MTD in 2021 vs 2012. Looking to be an even worse June for crops then even 2012 during the most crucial time for corn.\n\n**International Supply/Demand Concerns:**\n\nUSA is the largest corn grower in the world. The next two largest countries are China and Brazil. China had a bad growing season in 2020 and has increased their 2021 US corn export order 9.5 Million Metric Tons/ 394Million Bushels ([https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-19/china-has-bought-37-of-next-year-s-corn-imports-just-from-u-s](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-19/china-has-bought-37-of-next-year-s-corn-imports-just-from-u-s)). According to BIMCO the past 9 months of exports of corn to China are 77% higher than the previous year. Additionally, Brazil is having a bad growing season from severe drought and June 10th the World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE) report issued by the USDA reduced their latest production from 102million metric tons (mmt) to 98mmt, a reduction of 4mmt. While the Conab (Brazil's Agriculture Government) said Brazil production will go from 106.4mmt to 96.4, an even worse reduction of 10mmt according to their forecast. I'll split the difference and say 7mmt/273million bushels of supply will need to be made up in the global market. This is nearly 650 million bushels that need to be made up on the global market.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sea5yjcz1v571.png?width=445&format=png&auto=webp&s=e5c9134096fc8b282e84ec11bdc2f38ae0ccb3be\n\n**Why buy $CORN ETF:**\n\nCurrently the World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE) is projecting 1.5 billion bushels extra of ending stock for the US. This forecast was prior to the drought in Brazil and increased demand from China. From the extra demand from China and Brazil demanding an extra 650 million bushels, that leaves under a billion bushels. If the drought continues in Brazil, and China demand increases, there will be less than a billion bushels of extra corn supply/yield. Then the drought in the US that is not getting any media attention and WASDE has not adjusted down the 1.5 billion bushel ending stock forecast since March 2021, making it inline with the average corn growth yield per year of a 2% increase. In 2012 the drought caused a 22% decline in US corn supply, that would be 3.1 BILLION bushels or 2.2 billion bushels under supplied for the world. This is a \ud83d\ude80 about to blast to the moon!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https:\\/\\/seekin galpha.com\\/article\\/4413582-corn-8-to-10-dollars-per-bushel-by-2021-2023](https://preview.redd.it/d8dur4l02v571.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=14c60e2ae529b0de85e07578edab1b21487d4720)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https:\\/\\/seekin galpha.com\\/article\\/4413582-corn-8-to-10-dollars-per-bushel-by-2021-2023](https://preview.redd.it/g1udetz32v571.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=212588552bc6214222965b32a49ac541ee977bc5)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https:\\/\\/seekin galpha.com\\/article\\/4413582-corn-8-to-10-dollars-per-bushel-by-2021-2023](https://preview.redd.it/5rxqayn52v571.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=c578af23b7529b8b19fb975fdf2c9d854ac24c0f)\n\n**$CORN price:**\n\nThese images are from Seeking Alpha and they state they can see the closing price for corn going up to $8 to $10. Historically $8 has been a ceiling but with a shock to supply like this I would expect this to go to above $10. In 2012 when the drought hit and made headlines on June 15, 2012 the price of corn rose 64% in 2 months in a straight line. If corn prices rose 64% from here it would be $13, which seems like a big increase for corn in 2 months, but this increase has happened before and with commodities like lumber \ud83d\ude80, corn could be the next when it breaks $8 resistance. What this means for ticker **$CORN**, it mirrors the gain in the actual commodity. Currently $CORN is trading at **$20.96**, if corn rose 64% then $CORN would go to **$34** in about **2 months**. With inflation, general increased demand in the US currently, and the current drought $34 may be actually low. The 64% increase in 2012 was only based on a US drought. Now in 2021 we have a global drought and the economy is expected to do a 7% GDP and inflation is much hotter than 2012.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/al7rapk72v571.png?width=857&format=png&auto=webp&s=99078e20afd9e288e66f38ca19826a615f086e82\n\n2012 Corn commodity price. Commodity prices are different then stock prices, the 840 at the top is actually $8.40. Corn commodity uses whole numbers to reflect the price, basically just dropping the decimal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4slphm682v571.png?width=761&format=png&auto=webp&s=297c5914f60184ffc889871a69653d7d72cd2886\n\nIn June 2012 corn was sitting sitting at similar highs before the drought got attention and rallied 64%. Now in June 2021, we have pulled back from the highs and once the drought takes its effect on corn and the USDA reduces their forecast supply, there should be no problem blowing through the $8.00 resistance in corn and going to all time highs. \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf11 Some media attention would help too. When most droughts occur, the media loves to discuss the impact, continuously.\n\n**Short Interest:**\n\nThere is currently a 14% short interest in Corn. I expect as the price goes up closer to $8 more shorts will try to come in. Similar to other shorted stocks, these shorts will have to cover when corn goes above $8. When they cover this will just add more fuel to the \ud83c\udf3d\ud83d\ude80.\n\n**Concerns:**\n\n* Rain, the droughts end.\n* A bill is being talked about at the federal level to allow gas companies to not have to put ethanol in gas anymore. I don't see this passing or getting any traction under a democrat presidency because ethanol makes gasoline less harmful to the environment. Biden is pushing more environmentally friendly energies. Though ethanol gas is not better than electric or other forms of energy, removing ethanol from gasoline all together would be very harmful to the environment.\n\n**Positions:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[$10,000 in stock](https://preview.redd.it/gjevnuib2v571.png?width=1037&format=png&auto=webp&s=c30fc71dbbb5e794cfe69e898dedcc00ca776961)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[$15,000 in options](https://preview.redd.it/le1wk1xc2v571.png?width=1377&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff2d4c7ca9db72ef4af06aa6947e73f2be320070)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR:**\n\n* **Major global drought, buy $CORN potential >50% pop in 2 months.**\n* Significant drought in the Midwest/Grain belt, similar to 2012\n* Drought in Brazil\n* Increased Demand globally, especially China\n* Current price increase in corn is from general commodity rally/inflation and increased global demand, not supply concerns from the drought.\n\nHere is to high corn prices and enjoying chicken tendies! \ud83c\udf3d\ud83c\udf7b Look forward to peoples comments.", "id": "o22pa0", "created_utc": 1623950965.0, "score": 26, "upvote_ratio": 0.62, "num_comments": 84, "comments": [{"body": "CORN gang rise up!", "score": 26, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4277993440628052}, {"body": "Hmmm wall street was wondering when the apes were coming to commodities.
