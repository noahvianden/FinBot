{"title": "Blackberry QNX Design Wins 2019 to 2020", "selftext": " \n\nI went through all of blackberry's ER transcript and extracted the design wins here's the proof. [proof](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/investors)\n\n[Blackberry QNX Design Wins 2019 to 2020](https://preview.redd.it/ts59gvhoh1671.png?width=1400&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed3cab1e194ccf12075a5136f657c819dd87089d)\n\nNOTE: Their Fiscal Year (FY) is one year ahead of calendar year.\n\nThese are design wins for QNX in last two years only. These are major car OEM and defense and industry companies. It takes 18 months after win for revenue to show up on books. Majority of revenue is not on books yet from QNX.\n\n**Modern cars have over 100 ECU Modules**This is where QNX will have to go into majority of these critical and smart modules that connect to internet. This is how QNX will generate $25 per car produced. 100mil cars produced/year times $25...or $2.5billion revenue just from QNX. This does not include revenue from Blackberry Ivy. Ivy will be **\\~$10 per car times 175mil cars ANNUALLY!**! We're talking pure software revenue(high margin) of about **$4.25billion i**n near future annually just from QNX product.\n\n**Blackberry Monopoly in car modules + ASIL D certification**Blackberry has a monopoly in the Autonomous car modules and critical modules (brake system, accelerator system, modem, back camera, etc) because they hold ASIL D certification that no other real-time operating system can attain. This is why they won every OEM! Even tesla uses QNX in their modules they buy from other providers.\n\n**Blackberry QNX + Cylance**Blackberry went ahead and integrated cylance ai(industry leading) into QNX two years ago so basically it's the ONLY operating system that has cybersecurity built inside and is the only OS(with cybersecurity) that runs on cars, drones, trucks, medical devices, iot. Y**ou can't run** crowdstrike or mcaffe on cars!!\n\nIn short...institutions know this data and that's why Blackberry has high institutional ownership! Hedge funds are dumb and shorting because they were taking advantage of the transformation period of blackberry from hardware to software! F them!!!\n\n**Summary: This is extremely undervalued based on all the design wins. Basically every IOT device that's connecting and talking to smart city and infrastructure is using QNX because it's the only OS that has cyber security built inside. Do your own DD. This is not a financial advice.**", "id": "o2r8yp", "created_utc": 1624028906.0, "score": 427, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 83, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|36|**First Seen In WSB**|4 months ago\n**Total Comments**|241|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mwexoe/blackberrys_patent_value_and_overnight_stock_to_40/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o0v1qa/is_blackberry_qnx_a_rotary_phone/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mvn13j/blackberry_covered_calls_warningbe_careful/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mn2o5x/blackberry_is_a_monopoly_in_car_operating_system/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nw42fi/blackberry_does_nottt_make_phones/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o2r0mi/blackberry_qnx_software_moadd/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o2r8yp/blackberry_qnx_design_wins_2019_to_2020/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mm02a2/countering_dd_by_rivaaal_on_blackberry/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mwz7f2/dod_and_nhtsa_mandate_to_use_blackberry_jarvis/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nyyq9f/blackberry_undervaluationleader_in_ev_iot_and/) \n**Account Age**|4 months ago|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "this is why i always post proof of where i get the information from. every bit on my post is traceable to original source(blackberry ER transcript and investor relations). \n\nDid you find something wrong?", "score": 5, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3853492736816406}, {"body": "Positions OP", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "2000 shares of BB.

{"title": "I just bet against SPY and the DOW based on some DD. Am I stupid?", "selftext": "So I took positions against SPY today (and against the DOW, A/K/A \"Boomer SPY\") because I noticed what I thought to be a divergence between the movement of the market and the underlying indicators.\n\nFrom April 23 to June 17th/18th we can see the following:\n\nThe price of SPY has increased slightly.\n\nThe MACD has formed two bear crosses. Importantly: the second cross is at a lower point than the first cross, and thus it diverges with the underlying direction of the stock price (which is positive).\n\nThe RSI is also at a lower point on June 17th than it was on Aril 23, despite the underlying price going up.\n\nBelow is everything I've described thus far summed up in a doodle:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vabpwvs9s3671.jpg?width=1108&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3bbdc21acb8bf33d5b1245b33d68e7d63cc73040\n\nGenerally, when you see the indicators moving in a bearish direction while the stock is moving in a bullish direction it can be an indication that the stock price may reverse. This is also known as a divergence.\n\nAnother bearish indicator can be when a candle closes below a moving average. Swing traders tend to look at the 9 day and 50 day moving averages for confirmation of whether to enter or exit positions. Here, we can we can see a full candle close below the 9-day MA on 6/17 and a full close below the 50-day on 6/18. I think this is pretty significant because these candle closes formed right after the lower RSI/MACD figures.\n\nFor full disclosure I have positions in SPXS (which is a 3X inverse SPY ETF) and SDOW (which is a 3X inverse DOW ETF). I think we may see a continued reversal into next week based on this information and I'm posting this because I'm curious if other people are taking similar positions, or at least selling positions in anticipation of a reversal?\n\nAlso this is not financial advice.

Everything is stuck in a sideways pattern and has been for so long that this is really not all that crazy.  I just keep buying more SQQQ with the proceeds from the covered calls.  It will be extremely fun if the S&P drops like a rock and SQQQ skyrockets.  I have some in reserve (not sold as covered calls) to sell if the price explodes.  That's what I am really hoping for.  What led me to do this was the fact that A) I think the market is going to collapse eventually and B) they are paying NOTHING in interest on savings accounts anyways.  There's nothing to buy.  So I am just gambling it on an eventual market correction, which seems inevitable.\n\nOriginally I was very surprised that you could buy a covered call on SQQQ for a week or a month out since everyone says not to hold it over night.
