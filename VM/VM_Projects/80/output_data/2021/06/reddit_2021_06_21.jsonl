Not to mention they have their own brokerage platform, with options trading coming soon. And they also have great fucking customer service to keep people coming back time and time again.\n\n**Why is $SOFI being so heavily shorted?**\n\n$SOFI going public through a SPAC deal already made it heavily shorted based on a crackdown by the SEC. With a short volume ratio of 25.32%, it is one of the most shorted stocks on the market right now meaning you can get a great discount.\n\n**Galileo.**\n\nGalileo a company SOFI purchased for $1.2 billion is a payment processor with customers like Robinhood, Chime, Monzo, Revolut, Varo, and TransferWise. Google Cloud executive Derek White is joining the board as CEO with more than 20 years of experience in financial services replacing Clay Wilkes. Galileo in recent news just signed a deal with Verizon to provide a teen card. In a field, with companies like Stripe it's doing quite well with revenue increasing 97% first half of 2020, and their new launch Galileo Instant saw more than 1500 small businesses signup within the first six months.\n\n**Stripe.** \n\nStripe has had an amazing year and things are only getting better. Sofi after buying Golden Pacific Bancorp will expedite its process to a bank charter allowing it to take deposits and allowing it to offer lower interest rates on loans. Analyst Sean Horgan said that SoFi possesses \"a powerful cost advantage over incumbents which will lead to dramatic disintermediation over the next 5-10 years, leaving substantial primary bank accounts, revenues, and market value up for grabs.\" Not to mention that Rosenblatt gave it a $30 price target for you retards that's $8 a share in gains from current prices. And with SOFI stadium being a new staple in LA it's bound to boost sales, and forgot to mention that Cramer likes the stock and their brokerage directly competes with Robinhood. The stock is very much reminiscent of SQ in its earlier days. Currently, they do $547 million in revenue with member growth in the most recent quarter topping 110%, and with an estimated $2.4 billion in gross proceeds from their merger, they have all the funding they need.\n\n**TLDR**\n\nCramer likes the stock so you should too. Referring to it as the trifecta of fintech as Square, PayPal, and SoFi.\n\nEDIT: Just in, Cramer hates this stock.", "id": "o52xr3", "created_utc": 1624302790.0, "score": 300, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 82, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|21|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|2|**Previous DD**|[x](https://i.redd.it/3vv6pmhonn571.jpg) [x](https://i.redd.it/zndyya8usn571.jpg) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o52xr3/why_sofi_ss_an_absolute_steal_of_a_lifetime_right/) \n**Account Age**|2 years ago|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n    \nHey OP, **positions or ban.**", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Just ban, this is obvious.", "score": 5, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4643411338329315}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.35224756598472595}, {"body": "Yall forgot about the Superbowl catalyst.
