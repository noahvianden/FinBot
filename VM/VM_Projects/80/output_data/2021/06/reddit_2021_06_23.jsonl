BABA is disconnected from its fundamentals for very good reasons. The stocks do not represent real ownership of the company. The CCP will have no hesitation to commandeer foreign investor's stock ownership if they feel it beneficial to do so. \n\nThe DIDI IPO is but one recent example of how the CCP has no issue reminding chinese companies who the real owners are. Hint: it's not the company's management; and it's certainly not the company's investors, foreign or domestic. \n\nPeople outside of China don't realize how nationalistic the country and the populace is currently becoming. A glimpse of that nationalism can be seen in Xi's recent speech, echoing the sentiment that China will never suffer another Century of Humiliation. Due to Chinese weak position over the last century, the current generation of Chinese has not gone through a period of flexing its military muscle in pursuit of territorial expansion, unlike the West, so it has not experienced the painful lessons that Western countries has engaging in expensive militarism. **A non-negligible part of the Chinese public, I am sorry to say, is clamoring for payback for the Century of Humiliation. This should greatly worry all foreign investors. Their investment will be the first in the line of fire between a potential conflict (economic or otherwise) between the West and China.** \n\nYes, Charlie Munger and some the other wise investors and all that. I am sorry but I think Charlie and many Western investors do not appreciate the danger of the Chinese psyche of this century. Again, China has to take capitalism more seriously, respect shareholders' control and not view Chinese companies as fattened pigs waiting to be slaughtered for me to consider investing in these companies. An authorization of buyback and dividends will be a good start. Until then, it looks to me that Chinese companies want the benefit of the foreign capital market without the responsibility.
