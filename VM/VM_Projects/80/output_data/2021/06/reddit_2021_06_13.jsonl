I've read about it and I still don't get it", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Options are complicated and can take multiple passes to understand so don\u2019t get discouraged.\n\nMany people use them for gambling but thats not what I\u2019m going to talk about here, these things were invented to serve as a form of insurance to bring stability to markets and thats how you can use them to generate risk free income on a stock you own. (Yes I said risk free keep reading)\n\nOkay, in this explanation there are two characters\n\n*A farmer* who is going to sell a call option\n\n*A baker* who is going to buy a call option\n\nEvery year in our town the price of wheat fluctuates wildly, if the harvest is good the price falls, if its bad the price soars, and its hard for people to plan next years expenses.\n\nFarmers want to know before they plant how much they\u2019ll make per bushel of wheat, and bakers want to know in advance how expensive the ingredients for the flour will be.\n\nOur farmer can operate comfortably at $10 a bushel, and our baker cannot afford to stay in business if the price of wheat rises above $12 a bushel.\n\nThe farmer sells the baker a contract that gives the baker the right, but not the obligation, to buy the wheat at $10.\n\nThe farmer makes some money from the baker upfront on the contract. (This is the premium you make on a covered call)\n\nIf the price of wheat is **below** $10 at harvest, the baker would not exercise his contract, and would pay the cheaper marker price for wheat, he lost some money on the worthless contract BUT it served as insurance while it lasted.\n\nIf the price if wheat is **above** $10 the baker would exercise his contract and buy at a discount, the farmer lost out on potential gains from the high price BUT the premium he got for the contract reduces this loss, and he is confortable selling at the price anyways.\n\n**This last part is key** because you\u2019re the farmer in this scenario, I never sell a covered call at a price below what I\u2019d happily sell for. Instead of holding a stock from $5 to $10 and selling, instead you sell covered calls at $10 and get your $10+ a premium if it hits that number, or you keep your stock and your premium if it doesn\u2019t and you do it again until it rises.\n\nIf the stock never rises, the premiums you make from covered calls effectively lower your cost basis and generate profits that you otherwise would not have by simply holding a stagnant stock.\n\nThe reason I called this risk free is as follows\n\nPeople will tell you that you lose if the contract is exercised because you could have sold higher, and I\u2019m telling you that you probably would not have. Don\u2019t use these to gamble, find a price and time frame that you would consider the stock overpriced at. Say I have a stock at $27, if it runs to $40 by January I would sell because I don\u2019t think enough could happen in that time to justify that price.\n\nWell if thats true then you would miss out on any profits after that point anyway so those aren\u2019t real losses.
