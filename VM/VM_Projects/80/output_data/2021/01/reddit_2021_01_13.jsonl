{"title": "Covered call strategy for a multi-million dollar TSLA position?", "selftext": "I have 3,481 shares of TSLA that are worth $3.1M as of market close today. I want to figure out how to use this position to generate cash flow that I can use to acquire more TSLA shares as well as to build out other investments as well.\n\nI've sold covered calls on my SQ position to learn more of the mechanics and so I'm already familiar with this process but got my shares called away one time. I got greedy and after something like 7 or 8 weeks in a row of winning I sold during an earnings week when I had told myself not to do it because anything could happen. No surprise, SQ outperformed expectations and despite the great premium I made selling the covered calls I lost out on the share upside and I decided against buying back the position. I ended up rebuying some of that SQ position, but I share the story to show that I've already had some (failed) experience doing this.\n\nWhat recommendation would you have for me to sell covered calls on my TSLA position without losing shares? I don't want to get shares called away at all, but especially until after March because that's when the shares will transition to long term cap gains. Here were my initial thoughts on strategy:\n\n- TSLA is crazy at times so I was thinking one week out only.\n- Never sell during an earnings week unless it's really far OTM\n- Avoid selling during events\n- Hold onto a few percent in cash to buy back calls when I make a bad trade. etc\n\nAre there any additional resources I should learn from or anything else like that? When I was selling SQ calls it was very simple like \"Ok well, I don't think it will go up 15% this week so I'll just set my strike for 15% above.\" like really basic level thinking.\n\nAny feedback?", "id": "kw57q4", "created_utc": 1610499305.0, "score": 21, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 84, "comments": [{"body": "I have the same \"problem\" as you but with (approx) 1m AMZN and 1m MSFT bought quite a long time ago.
