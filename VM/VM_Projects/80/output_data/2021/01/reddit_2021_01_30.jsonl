{"title": "GameStop Update 4: Weekend Recap", "selftext": "For those who missed it... Here is what happened this week.\n\n1. The week started with a big push into GameStop. GameStop is a company that by most accounts is/was struggling to build a profitable financial model. Their 52 Week low was $2.57 per share. Giving them a Market Cap of roughly $200 Million.\n2. Melvin Capital, a Multi-Billion Dollar hedge fund has shorted the company (bet the stock will go down). In fact, somehow Melvin Capital has managed to allegedly short roughly 140% of the shares, borrowing more shares than are actually in existence. Side note: when you buy a stock, you can only lose the money you invested. However, when you short a stock your losses are theoretically infinite.\n3. The extreme short position by Melvin Capital created a potential buying opportunity which was identified months ago by Reddit user DeepFuckingValue. If you can buy enough stock and options of a highly shorted company, the short seller (Melvin Capital) is forced to take losses. They may also need to rebuy shares to settle margin calls which can cause the stock to go up even more.\n4. Over the past few months DeepFuckingValue's positions in GameStop have become something of legend, as the price went from his initial purchase price of around $5 per share, to opening the week at around $90 per share. Along the way both retail and institutional investors have gotten behind DFV and the short squeeze.\n5. One famous investor who invested big behind DFV is the legend Michael Burry who you may know from The Big Short. He put a large buy position on and is rumored to have made well over $300 million.\n6. By Tuesday night the stock is up HUGE closing the day around $145 per share\n7. We enter what is known as a Gamma Squeeze this is a cascading effect that occurs when prices move up quickly against short sellers. Quick Analogy: If a short squeeze is fast like a Corvette, a Gamma Squeeze is fast like a Tesla in Plaid mode with a Space X Rocket booster strapped to it (we will get to Elon later).\n8. Wednesday morning: \"We Like The Stock\". Stock moves to over $300 per share and closes the day over $350\n9. The band of retail investors, Robinhood traders, and heavy hitters grows huge on the buy side. Elon Musk steps up, for those who don't know Elon, in addition to being the richest man in the world he also is likely not a huge fan of Melvin Capital as he went to battle with them when they tried to short sell Tesla\n10. Melvin Capital's losses are reaching a point of potentially financially breaking their entire fund, allegedly, Citadel steps in to lend a few billion to help bail out Melvin Capital.\n11. A Battle Cry is let out \"We can Stay retarded longer than they can stay solvent\"\n12. Thursday morning GameStop opens up to an insane upswing and hits over $450+ per share. DeepFuckingValue is man of lore as his initial $50k investment is now worth over $50m\n13. Here is where things get dark...\n14. At this point in time Robinhood and a few other brokerage houses stop allowing traders to buy GameStop. Betraying their own user base. They only allow you to hold or sell. Allegedly from many reports, Citadel who helped bail out Melvin Capital is actually one of the biggest customers of Robinhood. To better understand how this might have happened, Robinhood operates as a platform that allows traders trade commission free, but part of the business model is to then sells the data of how retail traders are trading to large institutional players like Citadel. In other words, if you are using the product for free you are the product and your data is being sold.\n15. According to Justin Kan \"Citadel reloaded their shorts before they told Robinhood to stop trading GME\"\n16. GameStop Shares drop from $450+ per share to $130 per share in a matter of minutes as many traders literally are only able to sell.\n17. The list of big players supporting GameStop erupts. Names include: AOC, Dave Portnoy, Mark Cuban, Elon Musk, and Chamath Palihapitiya all who are outraged by the events. Many call for the founders of Robinhood to face potential jail time.\n18. WallStBets Reddit channel explodes to over 6 million users.\n19. Shares climb back slightly on Thursday to end the day just under $200 a share\n20. Friday opens with a big step up, Opening around $345. Robinhood allows some highly limited purchases of GameStop. Despite limitations, the share price holds closing the week at around $325 per share.\n21. GameStop is now a $22 Billion company\n22. DeepFuckingValue is on the front page of The Wall St. Journal.\n\nUntil Next Time...

They were worth what 20 -30 million and now they are worth 1 -2 billion now!!!! What do you think about that!!!! If he was a astute trader he would have sold his shares.

If not then I would need everyone else's support to get this post noticed for its various subjects. Thanks \n\n1) A thank you to the mods for all their hard work with everything that has been going on. \n\n2) The amount of people that have joined this sub. Okay I know the first thing people will do is check me. I got massacred by PRPL gang (fuck those mattresses), MSFT 200c, I saw GUH the day it was posted, and even IronyMan when his balls touched the ground. So why the young account? Well, it's because of the suspensions, this is my third account and I like my current username even though most of the time it does go tits up for me. \n\nWe went from 1.5M to 7M in the shortest period of time. This is ridiculous. Everywhere I am seeing those who make it pretty damn obvious that they just joined because they saw us on the news and don't know wtf is going on. It's annoying. Is there a way to filter out? Mods please let us know how we can help. I thought it was an excellent idea to make the sub private. \n\nRead the comments in this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8qh01/no_words_for_how_much_this_disgusts_me/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3\n\nAlso this post by  u/Jaker_20 is relevant for this point: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7vzq0/mods_please_make_sure_wsbs_culture_remains_intact/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3\n\n3) The international help. It was amazing to see people from all over the world aid by coming into agreement to flood the NYSE on GME, AMC, etc.  I thank you. We thank you. \n\n4) Exiting various brokerages. How much handz are there in my diamonds? Let me tell you, I initiated a transfer out of RobinDaHood while holding GME and AMC when I bought shares in both AT THE TOP. DIAMOND FUCKING HANDZ. But yes, I would like to establish a clean list of all the brokerages that will be on our blacklist. \n\n5) AMC holders, I will see you on the moon once my transfer is completed: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8cqvt/movie_theaters_opened_friday_in_the_chicago_area/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3\n\n*congrats you made it this far, I know you can't read*\n\nLASTLY\n\n6) That spineless cunt with erectile dysfunction who tried to sell us.

{"title": "Melvin Capital still isn't out, or it doesn't matter either way.", "selftext": "Edit: I'd like to preempt any reading of this because this post literally does not matter. Please read [this page](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html), it completely blows the usefulness of shorts volume out of the water.\n\nMods, if this is just a parrot of someone else's DD feel free to take it down. I read WSB for like 12 hours a day and miss new posts all the time.\n\n*Disclaimer: I'm a moron and not a financial expert, I own GME shares. This is all my opinion.*\n\nHello, my fellow retards. This GME movement has been seriously heartening for the common man, and the following that WSB has gained because of it is completely bonkers. This is all well and good, but on some level, GME is still a numbers game to me. Melvin announced that it had closed its position in GME and everyone here instantly doubted such a claim. I have some 8 pm coffee-fueled napkin math that suggests... maybe?\n\n**Point 1:**\n\n[Here](https://www.shortvolume.com/) is a website I've found very confirmation bias-y. It gives some ballpark numbers for short positions changed day by day. Over the last 10 days, we see a short volume of approximately 200m. That is a lot of changing shorts and give ample time for Melvin to have exited their short -at first glance at least. If we assume that every single one of those shorts was taking a new position as the price continued to rise over the last several days we see that from 1/22 through 1/26 there is approximately \\~82m shorts changing hands in the sub $133 price range. Then, from 1/27 to 1/29 (after GME broke $300) there is \\~34m short volume. If we assume that EVERY SINGLE SHORT got out, then bought back in as the price rose for the last \\~80m volume (to ultimately bring us to the SI estimate today) the best price that the shorts could possibly be holding, on average, is about **$180 per short**. In other words, **shorts are still massively underwater even if they've been frantically covering and doubling down for the last week**.\n\n**Point 2:**\n\nCNBC could be lying.\n\n**Point 3:**\n\n[CNBC could be telling the truth.](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/29/gamestop-short-sellers-are-still-not-surrendering-despite-nearly-20-billion-in-losses-this-year.html) This article mentions what a few experts (yes, Shkreli is an expert here) have said at this point: WATCH THE INTEREST RATE. If melvin exited their position as fast as they could, and there were not enough new shorts to pick up the slack, the interest rate would fall through the floor. I am taking this with a grain of salt considering that shorts have been doubling down throughout this month, but Melvin having probably the single largest short position on GME would definitely shake up the numbers. Edit: u/_UDW mentioned that [Ihor Dusaniwsky](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/29/gamestop-short-sellers-are-still-not-surrendering-despite-nearly-20-billion-in-losses-this-year.html?utm_content=Main&utm_medium=Social&utm_source=Facebook&fbclid=IwAR1DG7CAHua6XMuTf1zcioplEVRMnC-59LcNaiL-ck3qrklMsBDhtbfGytQ#Echobox=1611941927) also disagreed with the possible Melvin exit.\n\n**Point 4, the Devils Advocate:**\n\nMelvin, as per the CNBC article, completely exited its position on 1/26. That Tuesday was two things: the cleanest rising day we've had since $35, and some of the highest volume GME has ever seen. In my opinion, that rise could have been caused by constant buying pressure as Melvin unwinded their position, and there was definitely the volume to support that kind of a move without *completely* fucking the price.\n\n**My conclusions:**\n\nMelvin being out or not isn't a huge deal, but it does make the squeeze less sweet if they are gone. I am positive that a multibillion-dollar hedge fund would rather book a 30% year loss than a bankruptcy, and that they are at least hedging their position like a madman. However, at this point, someone is still holding a -100% bag at *least* and these new shorts entering GME, then leaving almost a day later with a complete loss will push some crazy momentum into the stock so long as it generally goes sideways or up.\n\nTR;CR:\n\nMelvin is probably lying but it doesn't matter, buy GME. \\*rocket emoji\\*", "id": "l8wf1z", "created_utc": 1612042749.0, "score": 215, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 79, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 74, "replies": [{"body": "well it's not like we would just stop if Melvin was out.

Despite any other lack of information available, this may be the best signal for why you should hold. Period.\n2.\t\u2060After the massive GME rise, there was a LOT of bot activity trying to distract, dissuade, etc. They're poisoning the well, and it's difficult to know what can be trusted and what can't. The one thing we DEFINITELY know, however, is that all of those attacks are being done to make us sell GME and spin the narrative that the complicit agents are victims / good guys.\n3.\t\u2060Robinhood + Citadel are trying to spin a BS narrative. If your institution can't afford something, shut everything down equally and go bankrupt. Choosing a specific stock to shut down is perhaps the most egregiously corrupt action ever taken in the market (which is saying A LOT). YOU weren't allowed to buy when major funds were, especially at CRITICAL times with CRITICAL buying opportunities to protect Citadel + big money and it collectively cost us tens of billions in lost opportunity. They're being sued, and rightfully so, but laws need to change to ruthlessly punish them NOW. Contact your representatives, SEC, etc. if you haven't already.\n4.\t\u2060Hedges might lie about their short positions, or restrict visibility as much as possible. They can break laws and face negligible fees by comparison to the rest of what they stand to lose. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume they might do this among many other PR stunts to terrify you. Keep updated. Someone pointed out that iborrowdesk is no longer reporting on updated gme because, again, the legal consequences don't matter enough and they're protecting their interests. Refer to #1.\n5.\t\u2060We don't know WHEN short positions will be covered, only the math that requires them to cover as we move forward. So if they delay and everyone gives in, they could save a lot of money. However, the longer they delay, the more they have to pay. So it's a matter of whether or not they double down and face higher risk/reward or not. Be prepared to WAIT.\n6.\t\u2060If you set visible limits, the hedge funds can use this data to their advantage and potentially have attack vectors against us. However, if you don't set limits, you might miss out on major trading spikes when they happen. The selfless act is to avoid low limits, but the ultimate goal is to distribute wealth to the people so take if you're the people who need it.\n7.\t\u2060If you're angry at Robinhood, move accounts AFTER this is over so that you're not frozen. Also, DO NOT transfer to your bank, because that will trigger a tax event. You're supposed to transfer between brokers. Look into this further yourself, since I'm not a tax expert.\n8.\t\u2060If you're angry at Google for removing negative Robinhood accounts, use Ecosia instead. They're just as user friendly, effective, and they give 80% of their profits to green energy and planting trees. Google will lose hundreds or thousands of dollars per year from your ad revenue and data collection.\n9.\t\u2060It's hard to anticipate what other stunts will be pulled to try to screw us over.
