{"title": "Be careful on YouTube.", "selftext": "I recently watched a video about a YouTuber who shed light on a frightening but real issue that takes place on YouTube. This individual was wrote to by a company telling him that he could make serious money by doing what he does already, all he has to do is mention a few specific penny stocks to his audience throughout his videos. This is unnerving and the company representative admitted to this YouTuber that he was already working with (and paying) dozens of popular investing channels. This is clearly a pump and dump scheme by this company in a effort to raise the penny stock\u2019s price, only for it to crash down later. Everyone wins except the audience tuning into these videos to learn and get some investment tips. I\u2019m sure there are genuine YouTubers out there who really want to educate and help people with investing but it\u2019s better to be cautious and always do your own research first.
