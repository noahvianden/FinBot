While GameStop doesn't have true market comparable peers, it is a traditionally a brick & mortar store that Ryan Cohen is looking to move more online (per his letter to the board).  This is a strategy taken by other B&M stores such as BBY (Best Buy, not your mom's soap company), TGT, and WMT.  I threw AMZN into the mix for shits and giggles, but it is really a different beast.  \n\nWhile these stores do more than just gaming based hardware and software, there isn't a single segment in the retail space to my knowledge that is growing as rapidly.  On a gross profit basis, GME actually outperforms the bulk of this peer group, (meaning the margin on the products they are selling have a higher profit margin, for you real tards).  Where it lags is in operating expense.  This can be mitigated in a couple ways: 1) closing less profitable stores (already being undertaken), and 2) transition sales to online.  While this may impact COGS, it will also improve OpEX as a % of total revenue.  I have put together a valuation showing GME projected pricing based on their paltry TTM revenue figures based on the peer group as well as on Operating Income if they were able to improve this figure as described above.  As mentioned, AMZN is an outlier, so I ran it with and without AMZN in the comps.  Based on all of the media attention (read: free advertising) GME has gotten through this craze, I believe revenue will improve going forward on that alone.  This has not been baked into this model.  \n\nThere is nothing in these prices related to any sort of short position either, just straight up valuation using the metrics listed in the spreadsheet.\n\nYou can disregard Online vs. In-store sales -- I started down that road and decided it wasn't going to be fruitful after digging through 10-Q's.  \n\nhttps://reddit-uploaded-media.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/images%2Ft2_ar6uj%2F3hzj18z2tkd61\n\nPosition: 2500 shares @ $44", "id": "l52u4b", "created_utc": 1611624254.0, "score": 263, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 89, "comments": [{"body": "Today, there was massive manipulation to suppress the true value of GME.

{"title": "An in-depth analysis of what would happen if we all held onto GME", "selftext": "In the not so distant future...\n\nYou leave the Michelin 3-star restaurant that you decided to bring your wife and her boyfriend to. As you walk to your newly purchased custom made Tesla (codenamed Model G), in the corner of your eye you see your old workplace. You think to yourself\u00a0*hmm.. brings back memories.*\u00a0You take out your BlackBerry G1000 and tell SiriQ to drive your wife and her boyfriend home as you cross the street. You think to yourself\u00a0*wow* *Siri has gotten 10 times better after BB bought over AAPL and merged Siri with QNX.*\n\nAs you enter your previous 9-5 abode, you smirk as you say to yourself\u00a0*Sir, this is a Wendy\u2019s.*\u00a0That joke just never gets old. Upon entering you immediately recognize the server. You used to hate him but that hatred has now turned to pity.\u00a0*Ah I\u2019ll throw him a bone*\u00a0you think to yourself as you give Andrew the secret hand signal to meet you at the back for the Wendy\u2019s Special.\n\nYou go out back to your usual spot but notice there\u2019s a homeless man there sleeping in the dumpster. Andrew then says\u00a0*It\u2019s $12,200 for a handie*. Exactly the price of one GME share. Oh god\u2026 has he really not covered his short position yet?! You take out your wallet to pay Andrew his fee but he catches you off-guard and snatches it away from you. He throws your wallet to the man in the dumpster and they both made a run for it. In the darkness you vaguely make up the back of the man\u2019s shirt which read \u201cMelvin Capital\u201d.\n\nYou shake your head as you take out your phone and tell SiriQ to send aid. Two beams of light descend from the sky and blast Andrew & Melvin.\u00a0*Impressive*\u00a0you think to yourself as you witness first hand the power of GothamX, a collaboration between Palantir and SpaceX. GothamX blasted a non-lethal laser developed by Tesla from a SpaceX satellite using the pinpoint accurate latitude and longitudes provided by Palantir.\u00a0*What a technological marvel*\u00a0you think to yourself. This was the only DD that you needed.\n\n*What perfect timing*\u00a0you think to yourself as your self driving Tesla Model G comes back after sending your wife and her boyfriend home. You submit your limit order for 10,000x contracts of Palantir & Tesla FD\u2019s, get in your Tesla and head home.
