{"title": "TODAY TSLA quietly launched its own solar power inverter. ENPH & SEDG's 3 year DUOPOLY ENDs. DD", "selftext": "**EARLY   TLDR: Today Tesla quietly launched its very own solar power inverter.   This wasn't announced until today. This is the first real threat to  ENPH  and SEDG's duopoly (and their subsequent absurd x30-x200 rise in  the  last 2 years). BUY ENPH or SEDG PUTS/SHORTS asap.**\n\nSources:\n\n\\-Tesla Website link: [https://www.tesla.com/support/energy/solar-inverter/tesla-solar-inverter](https://www.tesla.com/support/energy/solar-inverter/tesla-solar-inverter)\n\n\\-Electrek post: [https://electrek.co/2021/01/14/tesla-tsla-solar-power-inverter-launch/](https://electrek.co/2021/01/14/tesla-tsla-solar-power-inverter-launch/)\n\nOk retards, I've been following the solar space for some time and I just had to write something before others do.\n\n**Background - The reason behind SolarEdge and Enphase's meteoric rise.**\n\nAs   you can see in the charts below, ENPH and SEDG have rallied like crazy   the last couple of years. ENPH especially... it went from under $1 to   $208 as of today. Although ENPH was sort of a turnaround story, the  real  reason behind their rise was due to regulation (NEC 2017) that  required  rapid shutdown devices on solar systems in the US. This  basically  killed chinese and other inverter manufacturers in the US  that didn't  have module level hardware. Long story short, it created a  beautiful  duopoly in the residential solar market in the US during a  rapid growth  in the industry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ffzk2s2e2fb61.png?width=637&format=png&auto=webp&s=83e5cb301490f3687d48a763164b03c711ca3958\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mgfhttub2fb61.png?width=638&format=png&auto=webp&s=803242ed86d6a9892d0fefc594e2a2778942d3a6\n\n**Current Valuations of SEDG & ENPH**\n\nI'm   not going to get into the financials etc, but SEDGs P/E is 99 and   ENPH's is 163. Enough said. Of course the whole sector has rallied with   DEM win and recently with the senate upset. Fine. But this rise, like   EV's, is frothy as hell.\n\nHaving  said that, I wouldn't typically recommend anyone short or buy puts on any of the  solar names (RUN, JKS, CSIQ, DQ, SEDG, ENPH, TAN, ICLN, etc etc).   They were overvalued 3 months ago. They can keep going up up and up. As  a  lot of people have been posting here recently, the clean energy ETFs   have done incredibly well. HOWEVER with ENPH & SEDG's.....\n\n**Besides like Apple or Amazon, what's the WORST company to suddenly become your competitor...?**\n\nTESLA obviously. Elon Musk is the only guy that keeps bald nerd-turned-into Vin diesel looking mfer Bezos awake at night.\n\nWith   big dog Tesla entering the space, and becoming a DIRECT COMPETITOR out   of nowhere to ENPH and SEDG, this changes things. For those invested  in  any of the solar names, it's time to hedge by buying some ENPH/SEDG   puts. For any degenerates looking for a quick buck, ENPH and SEDG will   most certainly start coming down to reasonable valuations. You heard it   here first, this is the END OF THE DUOPOLY. Once chinese manufacturers   get back into this space, then it'll get commodified like the solar   panel guys (hello <10 P/Es).\n\n**PS: TAN and ICLN's biggest holdings are SEDG & ENPH...**\n\nHappy   Hunting Retards. For ENPH Longs... Please don't give me shit about  \"but enphase has micro-inverters, they are better than central inverter  blah  blah blah\". Don't be like the sleazy solar sales guys that knock  doors  in Long Island every week. Customers don't care if its micro vs.   string inverters. They care about price and brand recognition. From   Electrek *\"Finally, the greatest   advantage (although it\u2019s uncertain) is potentially the cost. Tesla could   potentially be able to achieve a better cost than the competition by   leveraging its already large power electronic production capacity for   its electric vehicles and charging stations.\"* Price will certainly  be lower than ENPH or SEDG.
