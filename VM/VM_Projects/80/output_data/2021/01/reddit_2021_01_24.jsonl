{"title": "Gamma effect in story stocks, Gamestop, Tesla etc. etc.", "selftext": "On Friday I wrote here about a pretty wild example of the short gamma effect on Gamestop [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/l2u65m/gamestop_options_gamma_above_60/). If you've been following me on here it's something I've been harping on for the last 6-9 months. I got a lot of questions on that post and wanted to go into a bit more detail about what it all means and what comes next.\n\nRefresher TLDR: A ton of retail flow is buying upside calls in high flying stocks and that creates short gamma for the sell side/ market makers. As the stocks go higher more and more stock needs to be bought to cover for the increasing short deltas created by that short gamma.\n\nGME was a hilarious example on Friday as it ran out of strikes on Friday's expiration and the MM's had essentially covered their short gamma for that day and the stock topped out and pulled back after that happened. Obviously, there are a ton of other factors, and the biggest in GME is all the short stock, creating a short squeeze. But the gamma is the most important/interesting one from an options perspective. In fact, gamma becoming a focus of options traders is one of the cooler developments I've seen over the past few months as it's a much more important factor (IMHO) than things I don't put a lot of stock in like unusual activity, for example. (unusual activity is really difficult to unpack and it suffers from a massive survivorship bias, whereas short gamma creates a real market inefficiency, imo)\n\nThe main question I've been getting is what's next and when does this all end. The unsatisfying answer is no one knows when it ends including me. There are so many unique factors creating the current environment, the pandemic, the fed, WSB, Robinhood, stimulus checks, you name it. But I can tell you that this is just the latest example of something that happens every decade or so and it does end... but that's not a bad thing. It just means that when it does, traders need to be able to adjust.\n\nThe way this current environment ends is when the market goes sideways or down for an extended period of time and all those OTM calls start to expire worthless. A bunch of those new traders will disappear, but many will stick around and adjust.\n\nAnd traders don't necessarily need to wait for that moment. The mania for upside calls is creating tons of opportunity for those willing to sacrifice a little upside now for staying power. Here's an example, using Tesla options for this week and showing a 850/900 debit call spread via Options AI (I am neither bullish nor nearish in TSLA earnings, just using this as an example):\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/fa2mv9cg1bd61.gif\n\nThis is an 850/900 debit call spread, costs about $18. The amazing thing about this spread is it is selling the 900 call at $16. Those 900 calls are PUMPED, and a 50 wide spread with a breakeven of $868 is trading almost the exact same price as a 900 call outright, with a breakeven of $916. You can see the strikes here:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b1zt0buy1bd61.png?width=508&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b3df877e1d0479d342cb081aebaeebcf3ea4fc6\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOf course, the upside is capped, but that is a massive difference in probability and is the type of trading that has staying power. And that's not even mentioning credit spreads, which have even higher probability of profit. This is the next conversation to be had in options for traders new on the scene. Of course there's nothing wrong with upside calls at the moment. I have no qualms about people doing what works, at any point. But it is important to also know what is more sustainable after the gamma runs dry.

An OTM call about to expire has very little delta, so it expires and it goes to zero, it's a normal course of business. An ITM call expiring has almost 100 deltas so by expiring it goes to actual 100 deltas, again, a very small adjustment and not a major binary event. Again, this is because delta-hedging is done continously and not only when put on and then when options expire, it is done throughout the life of the position (which for MMs would be their whole book, individual positions are irrelevant).\n\nNice discussion either way, oh and thanks for the kind words", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "Nicely put thanks for that!", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.21217209100723267}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5907790660858154}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3923397362232208}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5448635816574097}, {"body": "Wouldn't they want to hold until they see interest on next weeks options?

I'm sure technical analysis trader would've never bought GME at $20-$40 or held TSLA from <$50 (or <$250 pre-split) all the way to now, but both of which I, along many others who never use technical analysis, did. It's also much easier to mess up day trading than holding LEAPs on good solid companies with some FDs thrown in here and there based on research rather than candles and horoscopes. \n\nOut this entire list, I'd only play AAPL and maybe AMD, PLTR, TSM (in that order). There are plenty good DDs on these stocks if you look around (not necessarily in this sub), some concerns but overall looks good. CRM and CRSR aren't necessarily worse, but I haven't read about either of them much and would not play myself.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": -1, "replies": [{"body": "I'm commenting on this post that provided 0 DD and thus you should assume I'm talking specifically about this type of post / TA traders, defensive much?\n\nEdit - the fact I gave credit to good TA / algo having an edge by themselves should already logically result in the conclusion if one were to use them (correctly) alongside DD, they would be advantageous.
