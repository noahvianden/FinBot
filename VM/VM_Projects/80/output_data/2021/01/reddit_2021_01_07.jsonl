ICLN was up almost 4% during pre-market and as high as 9% during intraday high and HASI was up 10% during intraday high.

Thanks to overall negative sentiment of all things tech, QQQ closed the day red at -1.39% to $307 (retreating quite a bit more than IXIC given the weigh of big tech in QQQ).\n\n* Morning economic numbers had ADP reporting payrolls dropping to 123k in Dec, slightly below consensus of 130k. PMI was at 54.8 while consensus was 55.3, while factory order was up 1.0% MoM. Thankfully, none of these number fucking matters as the Dow, SPY, and IWM proceed to sky rocket with the market looking forward to stronger spending and stimulus from a Dem controlled govt.\n\n* Beyond weed, clean tech, and infrastructure - financial sector killed it today in particular mid-cap banks such as ZION (up 11.24%), CNC (up 9.81%), and KEY (up 9.73%). You'll find a similar story for large-cap bank stock with JPM closing up 4.70%, BAC up 6.25%, C up 5.75%, and WFC up 7.08%. It's a good thing I've already dumped my reopening [WFC leaps play](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kftjzt/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/ggarcbi/) of $25c and $30c which are now fucking ITM by $3~$8 and still have a year left to go on them. Nice.\n\n* In yet another confusing about-face and showing a real Karen spunk, the NYSE is *really* delisting the three Chinese telecoms this time. The real kicker though came in at 2:25 PM ET when news broke that US officials are considering *more* Chinese stock delisting, adding Chinese big tech Alibaba, Tencent, et al. to the potential list. A sea of red soon followed to compound the sell-off as BABA crater to the Earth's core and closed down -5.32%. Following suit, PDD closed down -5.58%, JD down -7.66%, and the same goes for Chinese EV NIO at -5% and XPEV at -2.62%. LI escapes semi-unscathed and closed the day up 2.48% thanks to a new BofA coverage with a Buy rating and a PT of $42.\n\n* In WSB meme stock land, GME was on track for a solid 8-9% day until the storming of the capitol occurred, PLTR's fade accelerated further while MT stays modestly flat, bouncing back from the overall market sell off. GME closed up 5.70% to $18.36, PLTR closed down -4.31% to $23.54, and MT closed up 0.32% to $24.70. ICLN, a new WSB favorite due to new balance of power in Congress might be added to future roundup if it continues to pump. Imagine that, a clean energy boomer ETF becoming a meme stock. The iShares fund managers are probably wondering why their alerts going tits up with social media mentions and sentiment brewing.\n\n* Random trade ideas (these are not financial advice and if it goes wrong that's your own gdamn fault):\n\n    1) FSLY leaps Jan 2022 90c or 100c+ for eventual TikTok climbing back fully onto the service as ByteDance pointedly makes a political jab at outgoing administration. Headwind on this retarded play: cloud/stay-at-home stock continues to take a beating as rona gets under control as vaccine roll out picks up. \n\n    2) Sell AAPL cash secured puts Jan 15 120p to 122p if the big tech fade continues rest of the week. These ~0.18 to 0.24 delta strikes are likely safe enough and if assigned, you'll have an upcoming ER on Jan 26 to sell IV pumped covered calls to get out of the trade intact. Feb 19 puts are likely okay to sell as well given you'll receive much more premium from the ~43 dte chains. Headwinds on this retarded play: its CSP and CC. As boomer as it gets. \n\n    3) BABA leaps and/or March debit call spread for another bounce in a wild trading week for BABA. March 230c/250c is probably a sufficient spread while baking in a bit of IV via ER which is on Feb 11. Jan 230c to 250c if you're not poor. Headwind on this retarded play: Jack Ma really is missing and the US govt really will delist a 600 bil market cap Chinese ADR, forcing out all major US institution holders. Yeah, right.\n\n* The DOW closed up 1.44% or 437 pts, Nasdaq down -0.61% or -78 pts, S&P up 0.57% or 21 pts, and RUT closed up 3.98% (!!) or 78 pts. Stay in school kids and avoid storming federal buildings or Twitter will start banning your fucking account. (TWTR locks POTUS account for 12 hrs and is down -1.99% AH).\n\n(Yesterday's [recap](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kr7ze8/reeeeeeeeecap_of_todays_market_driving_news_jan_5/)).", "id": "ks13de", "created_utc": 1609978905.0, "score": 421, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 83, "comments": [{"body": "Riots at the Capitol = Futures green.", "score": 147, "replies": [{"body": "I was gonna name this \"Jan 6, 2021 Civil War edition\" but didn't want to inflame the situation further heh.", "score": 86, "replies": [{"body": "im so god damn pissed\n\nlost 3% when I was up 6% cause of them goofs and probably stopped a run", "score": 41, "replies": [{"body": "Civil war is bad for business.

{"title": "Why $QQQJ isn't done - YUUUUUGE POTENTIAL", "selftext": "Tired of seeing ICLN and TAN posts and feeling FOMO because you missed the rocketship ETF? Well, look no further than QQQJ, an ETF which tracks the NASDAQ Next Gen 100 Index (the next 100 NASDAQ companies after the ones in QQQ). \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nAs expectations for an economic recovery increase due to the incoming Biden administration, we should see continued growth in the stocks that comprise QQQJ, more so than the large-caps that comprise QQQ. This evidence can be seen by backtesting data provided on the NASDAQ website, which compares the performance of QQQJ against other mid-cap fund performance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Back-tested 1-year returns](https://preview.redd.it/0vpf5800yw961.png?width=1008&format=png&auto=webp&s=209a318c5e67a98e8609022c2c2ffd6034485856)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Back-tested 10-year returns](https://preview.redd.it/nfmx41j1yw961.png?width=933&format=png&auto=webp&s=c232397f03f07eac82456b04bbdbbb5e008b2aa8)\n\nSome of its more well-known holdings include recently beat-down companies such as:\n\n* ROKU (down 5% from December highs)\n* TTD (down 20% from December highs)\n* BYND (down 18% from December highs)\n* DKNG (down 10% from December highs)\n\nDespite this beatdown of its more famous holdings, it's still almost back to pre-December crash highs. More importantly, the premiums on its calls are still lower compared to other similarly priced ETFs.\n\nThe incoming volatility from the swearing in of a new president should also cause an IV spike.\n\nBut won't growth be limited because companies will move into QQQ as soon as they grow? Not necessarily - in a bull market, all stonks go up, including those in QQQ. If all stonks are going up, then everyone wins, but QQQJ wins more.\n\n# More confirmation bias:\n\nBelow is some historic data showing what happens when we have a Democratic president and a split or Republican-led Congress. Combine this with the Roaring Twenties, vaccine hopes, stimulus hopes, economic recovery hopes, and super hot growth potential in healthcare, tech, IT etc, and QQQJ rocket confirmed.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lmn6ix83yw961.png?width=789&format=png&auto=webp&s=f278c0d3f7bf60b2676dda3f7421e703c7aedee0\n\n# Charts\n\nI've done some rudimentary crayon analysis on Tradingview, and as you all can see, we should see QQQJ at 35 sometime around March. This is based on the most bearish analysis I could find based on its current trend and macroeconomic conditions. As you can see, it's shown relatively stable growth thus far (aside from the crash in December).\n\n[Rudimentary Bearish Crayon Analysis](https://preview.redd.it/jdhzylf4yw961.png?width=1060&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b75e4174338e6161bf7467950f3512f840f3319)\n\nAlternatively, we could see hyper growth as the stocks in the Next Gen 100 Index rally based on an optimistic outlook from the potential redo of the Roaring Twenties, vaccine hopes, stimulus hopes, economic recovery hopes, and super hot growth potential in healthcare, tech, IT etc. Below is my best bull-case TA drawing:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Advanced Bull Crayon Analysis](https://preview.redd.it/fi72sz56yw961.png?width=931&format=png&auto=webp&s=c693b0b836a9f0b30a2b706821970d8088c95796)\n\n# HERE'S THE KEY POINT\n\nSome of QQQJ's holdings recently suffered major beatdowns and are poised for recovery.\n\nPremiums are higher than they were two weeks ago but still undervalued compared to similarly priced ETFs. June 35cs are going for $1.10 right now.\n\nBased on my ~~astrology~~ TA predictions, these should be ITM by March/April, at which time you can either sell the calls or just exercise them and sell the shares.\n\nBuzzwords:\n\nROARING TWENTIES VACCINE STIMULUS HYPE HEALTHCARE TECH IT RECOVERY STOCKS MOON ROCKET\n\n# Positions\n\n100x June 35c \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80", "id": "kscrx2", "created_utc": 1610024357.0, "score": 213, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 86, "comments": [{"body": "This sub really swings hard between posts on very in-depth analysis and really brain-wrecking shitposts\n\nI love this sub", "score": 122, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3542332053184509}, {"body": "I see three \ud83d\ude80, so I assume you are a man of culture, I\u2019m in", "score": 42, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.10383768379688263}, {"body": "500 contract June 35c@0.65 Yolo OG QQQJ grandmaster checking in.

I'm talking Advanced Micro Devices.   \n\n\nWhat does AMD do? They make CPU and GPU's. What do those do? Well without computer processors, you wouldn't be able to yolo your life savings on OTM options, and your wife wouldn't be able to send nudes to her boyfriend.  GPU's are cool too. Right now NVDA is making the best GPU's. But AMD is 2nd best! NVDA is currently trading at 529.78. That's pretty good. But AMD is only trading at 94.95!   \n\n\nI know that youre thinking little buddy. If AMD is making the 2nd best GPU's, shouldn't they be a little closer? That's right retard. But there is more.   \n\n\nAMD makes CPU's too. Those are rad. In fact, AMD is making some of the best processors in the world right now. That's a big deal, CPU's are used in everything. Probably takes some really smart nerds to make those. Not anybody can do that.   \n\n\nIntel is falling behind in the competition, and AAPL is starting to make their own CPU's. That leaves the rest of the market for AMD.  Surely lots of companies (HP, Dell, Lenovo) will want to use the BEST (AMD) CPU's in their desktops and laptops. And they are already trending that way. Some of the best computers you can buy right now have AMD processors. That's right, your favorite porn machine might have an AMD processor in it right now.   \n\n\nYOU KNOW WHAT ELSE HAS AN AMD CHIP IN IT?  \n\n\nEVERY XBOX SERIES X AND PLAYSTATION 5. That's right. If you didn't waste your stimmy on one of these consoles, your wife's boyfriend probably did. And if he didn't buy one for himself, he probably bought 2 or 3 for your kids. Theyre everywhere. These things are selling out everywhere, and we all know it. The processing power that allows you to look at those sweet cyberpunk tits is all thanks to AMD.   \n\n\nBut what gives?
