{"title": "A case for AMC", "selftext": "I've never done a DD before so ~~bear~~ (no fuck that) **bull** with me.\n\n(Also, apparently this post isn't allowed at WSB... Who knew.)\n\nI have ADD so in no particular order (but at least labeled) here are my thoughts:\n\nFA = Fundamental AnalysisTA = TechnicalTF = Tin Foil Analysis\n\n* (TF) Now that Biden's in office, covid isn't going to be politicized, which means (shitty or not) people will be much more relaxed about it. Movie theaters will no longer be scary; and many people have fond memories of watching movies in theaters during the winter. I don't because I never had friends. Or money.\n* (FA) Covid hit AMC harder than the steamroller that mowed down all the GME call writers today, sure, fine I'll give you that. But after their largest drop in revenue in Q2, right in the middle of the height of the pandemic, they were still able to turn around and fix some of it. Going from 1 bil to 20 mil is awful, but going from 20 mil to 200 mil while the landscape is even worse takes skill.\n* (TF) Some of the movies coming out this year are[block busters for sure](https://variety.com/lists/most-anticipated-films-2021/in-the-heights-june-18/). A James Bond movie; at least TWO marvel movies: Scarlet Johansson movie and Spiderman 3 AND bonus: Venom! With Woody and Serkis!!; Godzilla vs Kong only the most awaited movie since sliced bread FINALLY; some more live action Disney stuff which ok i guess; an actual good Ghostbusters with Paul Rudd and the ORIGINAL FREAKIN CAST; Matrix. Fuckin. Four.; Fast and Furious 9 (say what you will, these movies are popular as fuck); a whole bunch of SJW stuff; and the coup de grace: An actually animated **Disney movie AND a minions movie**. I have two kids and I stg the last year has been so fucked up for them. **I know I am not the only parent around who will immediately take their kids to the movie for these.** They deserve it!\n* (TA) Beat GME volume today by almost 3:2; the bots were busy baby, but WSB was busier! Coming fresh off the gains of GME, a lot you tards dumped it into AMC, and we found out a few things. First of all the volume holy shit, but we found the resistances. 3.55 is a notable one; it's the bottom of the dip in December before it crashed. Maybe a bunch of standing limits to sell to recoup bad life choices. Honestly I have no fucking clue what I'm doing with Technicals. Everyone's got their own superstitions about their lines and dots and shit.. I definitely have mine, but they are so far up my own ass that I'm starting to see daylight again and it's telling me to learn more. I'll stay in the dark for now; Tin foil's the best way to trade anyway.\n* (FA) Again, they've been doing this stuff for a long time. They've got this really great plan for keeping the theaters Safe and Clean called \"AMC Safe & Clean\u2122\", and they've even partnered with Clorox to make it happen. They prioritize it and proudly present it on their website. They appear to be using technology to their advantage to help them with these plans, for example leaving a seat between parties with seat numbers, and allowing snacks ordering via smartphones (fuckin' genius). They'll provide a mask for $1 if you didn't bring one, which is a good service and they aren't losing money on it. It looks to me like they have a fffuckin' plan for this shit and as the theaters open they are poised to lead the standards for other theaters going forward. They have seriously reduced costs and have seemingly thought about exactly how to get out. I think this is a \"Really Good Sign\u2122\".\n\nIdk I'm just some idiot who is apparently shilling really fucking hard right now so I'll just end the post. But I give this trade 3 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80's but no \ud83c\udf19.

{"title": "$SNE, MASSIVE DOUBLE DICK INSIDE. Poised to moon long-term (Computer vision boom, EV boom, autonomous driving tech, gaming boom, music streaming boom, cross-media IP, vertically integrated anime streaming monopoly, online medical services boom, shift to mirrorless cameras)", "selftext": "Listen up retards. Do you happen to feel regret because you always think \u201cohhh if I yoloed my savings on TSLA/AMD/NVDA \ud83d\ude80 leaps years ago I could be rich by now!!!\u201d \n\nWell if you didn't know already, it doesn\u2019t really matter what happened in the past. Hindsight will always be 20/20. You shouldn\u2019t be harsh on yourself on your past self that your past self wasn\u2019t retarded enough to yolo their savings into AMD/TSLA/.... Your past self doesn\u2019t have the same knowledge that your current self has. It\u2019s fine. If you judged those stocks with the best DD you could do at the time and didn\u2019t think they were worth it, then you did a good job.\n\nIf you always think about what you could/should have done in the past, then you don't have the right attitude to play the stock market casino imho.\n\nThe single most important thing is to be able to look ahead. There are always plenty of opportunities around. There are thousands of rockets that are still on earth right now. Some may depart this year, others will stay a little longer on earth. The true strength lies in being able to identify those rockets with the knowledge you have right now. And if you still miss most rockets that will take-off this year that's fine, maybe you'll learn, get better and you'll do better next year.\n\nNow, what if I told you there\u2019s a big rocket that\u2019s parked right right here on earth and it has decent chance for take-off this year? Maybe it won't quite reach the moon this year yet, but hey leaving the exosphere should already be a cool milestone.\n\nIt has **rock-solid fundamentals** and will see lots of **growth** in the following years/decade.\n\nIt\u2019s a company that has the fundamental technology to power all the **computer vision tech**, which is bound to boom this decade.\n\nThe company we\u2019re talking about is of course **Sony**, and it is **extremely undervalued** right now.\n\nIts **P/E is only 14**. They have a **P/S of 1.65**, a **PEG of 0.92** (< 2 is already somewhat exceptional for a company/conglomerate of Sony\u2019s size, under 1 is a steal) \n\nMuch lower than all of its same-sector peers. This indicates **significant undervaluation**.\n\nNext up Sony has a **P/CF 13.2**, **ROE of 20%** (S&P 500 average is 14% which would already be considered pretty good. 20% ROE is excellent), **PEGY of 0.89**, **P/B of 2.65** and finally Sony has **$41.6B in cash on hand**. This makes Sony one of the cheapest tech/entertainment/EV/semiconductor growth stocks you will find on the market. \n\n(ROE of 20% + PEGY of 0.89 + PEG of 0.92 means this company is a growth stock based on the numbers alone, but we\u2019ll dig into the actual company and overall outlook in a moment)\n\nI challenge all retards to find a company with similar benchmarks in one of the mentioned sectors, seriously. \n\nQuite frankly doing this DD honestly blew my mind. I kept looking everywhere for reasons why the company could be so undervalued and why they may struggle in the future. Very important to look at all the challenges the company faces to make sure I\u2019m not just doing confirmation bias DD. But all I could find was the opposite. After several weeks and months of working on this DD, I can only conclude that it is overall a very solid company for a bargain price. The new CEO is taking the company in a great direction imho and I'm begin to think he could be Sony's Satya Nadella.\n\nSo if you want some easy tendies, maybe consider $SNE while it is still cheap, I\u2019d say.\n\nFor the autists out there who care about **analyst ratings**, SONY ($SNE) currently has **18 BUY ratings**, **2 OVERWEIGHT, 4 HOLD and 0 SELL**. (**= analyst consensus is a STRONG BUY**). Very little analysts cover this stock compared to other entertainment/tech companies, so this adds to my assertion that **the stock is very much under the radar**. Which means **you have time to get in before it gets noticed by the larger investing world and before it starts to get a more fair valuation** (P/E of around 30 would be more fair for this company I think, but still cheaper than many same sector peers). But, anyway the few analysts who do happen to cover this company are basically all saying it\u2019s an instant-buy at its current price.\n\nMost boomer investors still think big Japanese tech companies are dinosaurs that have long been surpassed by China, South Korea and Apple etc ages ago. Young boomers may think Sony = PlayStation and that it's it. But the truth is that PlayStation, while very important (about 24% of Sony's total revenue last year), is a part of a larger story.\n\nLots of investors in general associate Sony with the pass\u00e9 Japanese electronics companies from the 80\u2019s and the 90\u2019s. Just like a lot people may think BlackBerry is a struggling phone company.\n\nWhile Sony may not be the powerhouse in consumer electronics it was in the 80\u2019s and the 90\u2019s, in a lot of ways they are more relevant than ever before. Despite being a well-known brand and being known as the company behind PlayStation, for some reason its stock still seems to be under the radar among both retail and institutional investors. And boy, are they mind-blowingly undervalued. Even if a big part of its business would collapse tomorrow, they would still be slightly undervalued. And I am about to tell you why.\n\n(& btw compared to Japanese tech/entertainment stocks $SNE is still super cheap (Canon, Nikon, Toshiba, Sharp, Panasonic, Square Enix, Capcom, Nintendo, Fujitsu all have P/E ratios ranging from 18 to 77 and none of them have the combination of global clout, fundamentals & growth prospects that Sony has))\n\n2021 Sony as a corparation is not the fucking Sony from 2005-2015\u2019s, just like BlackBerry in 2021 is not the fucking Blackberry from 2012. Just like Garmin in 2021 is not Garmin from 2011. Just like AMD in 2021 is not AMD from 2012.\n\nNo, in 2021, Sony is the global leader in imaging technology and people do not fucking realize it. Sony has 50% marketshare in the CMOS image sensor market. There\u2019s a very good chance the smartphone in your pocket has Sony image sensors (unless it\u2019s a Samsung phone). Sony image sensors are powering a big part of today's vision/camera technology. And they will power even more of tomorrow's computer vision tech.\n\nIn 2021, Sony is a behemoth in video games, music, anime, movies and TV show production. Sony is present in every segment of entertainment. Sony\u2019s entertainment branches have been doing great business over the past 5 years, especially music and PlayStation. Additionally, Sony Pictures has completely turned around.\n\nIn 2021, Sony is the world\u2019s biggest music publisher (and second biggest music company overall). Music streaming has been a boon for Sony Music and will continue to be.\n\nIn 2021, Sony is among the biggest mobile gaming companies in the world (yes, you read that right). And it\u2019s mainly thanks to one game (Fate/Grand Order) that nets them over $1B revenue each year. One of the biggest mobile gaming companies + arguably biggest gaming brand in the world (PlayStation).\n\nIn 2021, Sony is an EV company. They surprised the world when they revealed their \u201cVision-S\u201d at CES 2020. At the reception was fantastic. It is seriously one of the best looking EV\u2019s. They already sell sensors to Toyota. Sony will most like sell the Vision-S's tech to other car manufacturers (sensors for driving assistence / autonomous driving, LiDAR tech, infotainment system).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[40 sensors in the Sony Vision-S](https://preview.redd.it/w81udxr5r5d61.png?width=1520&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0c314e8195fa8e5745212346d8b4f2b0370a91e)\n\nConsidering the overwhelmingly good reception of the Vision-S so far, I suspect the Vision-S could be another catalyst that will put Sony as a company on the radar of investors and consumers.\n\nWe've seen insane investment hype for anything even remotely related to EV over the past year. We've seen a company that barely had a few EV design concepts (oh wait, they had a gravity-powered truck though) even get a $30B market cap at some point lmao. \n\nBut somehow a profitable company ($SNE) that has an EV that you can actually drive, doesn't even have a fair valuation?\n\nIn 2020\u2019s Sony\u2019s brand value is at their highest point since 12 years. In 2021, it is projected to be a its highest point since 2001 assuming same growth as average yearly growth from 2015 to 2020. Keep in mind brand valuation is a bit bullshitty as there\u2019s no standardization to compare brands from different sectors, let alone non-consumer-facing brands with consumer-facing brands. But one thing we can note is that Sony both as B2C brand and as a B2B company is on a big upwards trend. \n\n[https://interbrand.com/best-global-brands/sony/](https://interbrand.com/best-global-brands/sony/)\n\n[https://careers.uw.edu/blog/2020/03/17/these-are-the-10-biggest-video-game-companies-in-north-america-shared-article-from-zippia/](https://careers.uw.edu/blog/2020/03/17/these-are-the-10-biggest-video-game-companies-in-north-america-shared-article-from-zippia/)\n\nIn 2021, Sony is an entertainment behemoth. They have grown their entertainment branches by a huge amount over the past 5 to 10 years (they made some big acquisitions in the music space especially and they\u2019re now also all-in in anime). I don\u2019t think people realize how big Sony is as an entertainment company. I dug up the numbers and as of Q3 2020, PlayStation is the second biggest video game company in the world (Tencent is #1) in revenue (I suspect Sony might dethrone Tencent after Sony\u2019s FY Q3 2020 is released). But Sony already comes very close to Tencent especially if you add Fate/Grand Order (which is under Sony Music and not under PlayStation) under PlayStation. \n\nThere\u2019s no single other company that has this unique combination of a dominant/important position in all entertainment segments. (video games + music + movies + TV series + anime + TV networks). I guess Tencent maybe?\n\nIn 2021, Sony has amazing momentum in the camera space. If you\u2019re familiar with the enthusiast photography space, you should know this. Basically, the market is slowly shifting from SLR to mirrorless cameras. This is because mirrorless cameras tend to smaller/lighter, have faster AF, better low light performance, better battery life and better video performance. Sony is the company that has been specializing in the development for mirrorless cameras for over a decade while Canon\u2019s bread and butter has always been SLR cameras. Sony is in the lead when it comes to mirrorless cameras and that\u2019s where the market is shifting towards. Because the advantages of mirrorless have become more and more apparent and Sony\u2019s cameras have become technically superior, Sony has gained quite a bit of market share over Canon and Nikon in the last few years. In 2019, Sony overtook Nikon as the #2 camera manufacturer. Sony is in an upwards trend here. (they have the ambition to become the world\u2019s #1 camera brand) Sony also has very good marketing for their cameras. (Sony has a lot of YouTubers / influencers / brand ambassadors for their cameras despite being a smaller brand than Canon)\n\n(just search on YouTube and/or Google \u201cswitching to Sony from Canon\u201d just to give you an idea that they do have amazing brand momentum in the camera space. You won\u2019t get as many hits for the opposite) \n\nA huge portion of Sony\u2019s profit comes from image sensors in addition to music and video games. This is in addition to their highly profitable financial holdings division & their more moderately profitable electronics division.\n\nSony\u2019s electronics division, unlike other Japanese brands, has shown great resilience against the very strong competition from China & South Korea. They have been able to maintain their position in the audio space and as of 2020 are still the global market leader in high-end TV\u2019s (a position they have been holding for decades) and it seems they will continue to be able to maintain that. \n\nBut seriously this company is dirt-cheap compared to any of its peers in any segment and there\u2019s various huge growth prospects for Sony:\n\n* CMOS image sensors & Sony\u2019s overall imaging prowess will boom due to increased demand from automotive sector, security & surveillance industry, manufacturing industry, medical sector and finally from the aerospace & defence industry. On the longer term, image sensors will continue to boom due to increased demand for computer vision & AI + robotics. And for consumer electronics demand will remain very high obviously.\n* Sony is aiming for 60% market share in the CMOS image sensor market by 2026. Biggest threat here is Samsung here who have recently started to aggressively invest in image sensors and are challenging Sony. Sony has technological lead + higher production capacity (and Sony will soon open a new plant in Nagasaki), so Sony should be able to hold off Samsung.\n* The iPhone 12 Pro has 3 cameras + a lidar sensor. Apple now buys 3 image sensors (from Sony) + LiDAR sensor (from Sony) per iPhone 12 Pro they manufacture. Remember the iPhone X and iPhone XS? That one had \u201conly\u201d 2 rear cameras (with image sensos from Sony of course). Basically, Sony will be selling exponentially more image sensors as more smartphones get equipped with more and more cameras. \n* Now think about how many image sensors Sony can sell to Apple if the iPhone 13 will have 5 cameras + LiDAR sensor (I mean the number of cameras on smartphones certainly won\u2019t decrease)\n* Gaming (PS5 hype, PSN game sales are booming, add-on content is booming, PS+ subscribers count is booming and finally PSNow & first-party games sales are trending upwards as well). Very consistent year-on-year profit & revenue growth here. They have a history of beating earnings expectations here. The number of PS+ subscribers went from 4M to 48M in just 6-7 years. Investors love to hype up recurring revenue and subscription services such as Disney+ and Netflix. Let\u2019s apply the same logic to PS+? PS+ already has more subscribers than HBO Max in the USA.\n* PlayStation (video games in general) has not even scratched the fucking surface. Most people who play video games now are millennials and kids. Do you think those millennials will stop playing video games when they grow older? No, of course not. Boomers today also still watch movies and TV. Those millennials have kids and those kids are now also playing video games. The kids of those kids will also play video games etc. Basically the total addressable audience for video games will by HUGE by the end of the decade (and the decades after that) because video games will have penetrated all age ranges of the population. Gaming is the fastest growing segment of the whole entertainment business. By a large margin. PlayStation is obviously in a great position here as you can guess from the PS5 hype, but more importantly imho, the growth of PS+ subscribers (currently a bit under 50 million) and PSN users (>100 million MAU) over the past 5 years shows that PlayStation is primed to profit from the audience growth.\n* On top of that you have huge video game growth in the China where Sony & PlayStation is already much better established than Xbox (but still super small compared to mobile games and PC gaming in China). Within the console market, Xbox only competes with PlayStation in North America. In the rest of the world, PlayStation has an enormous lead over Xbox. Xbox is simply a lesser known and lesser desirable brand in the rest of the world\n* Anime streaming (basically they have a monopoly already + vertical integration, it might still be somewhat niche right now, but it will be big within 5 years. Acquiring Crunchyroll was a very good move)\n* Music streaming (no, they don\u2019t have a music streaming service, but as music streaming grows, Sony Music also gets a piece of the growing pie through licensing/royalties, and they also still have a little 2.8% stake in Spotify)\n* Apple, Amazon, Netflix, AT&T and Disney are currently battling it out in the streaming wars. When there\u2019s a war you have little chances of winning, you shouldn\u2019t be the one waging the war. You should be the one selling the ammo. Basically Sony Pictures (tv shows + movies) is in that position. Sony Pictures can negotiate good prices for their content because Apple, Amazon, Netflix, AT&T are thirsty for content and they all want their own exclusive content. Sony Pictures does not need to prop up their own streaming service just like Sony Music doesn\u2019t need their own music streaming service when they can just license out their content and turn a profit. There will always be demand for TV & movies content, so Sony Pictures is well positioned is as an independent content provider. And while Apple, Amazon, Netflix, AT&T and Disney are battling it out on the forefront, Sony is quietly building their anime empire in the background. Genius business move from Sony here, seriously. They now have anime production & distribution.\n* Netflix has 200M subscribers and they currently have a 250M market cap. Think about what Sony will have in 5 years? >30M Crunchyroll subscribers (assuming all anime will be consolidated into Crunhyroll) & >100M PS+ & PSNow subscribers? Anime and gaming is growing faster than movies and TV shows. (9% CAGR for anime, 12% CAGR for gaming vs. 5% CAGR for the whole movies & TV show entertainment segment which includes PVOD, SVOD, box office, TV etc etc). And gaming as a whole is MUCH bigger than SVOD streaming. Netflix gets 99% of their revenue & profit through subscriptions. For the whole Sony Group Corporation, their subscription services (games + anime) it\u2019s currently only 4.5% of their total revenue. And somehow Sony currently has a meagre $128B market cap?\n* PlayStation alone is bigger than Netflix in terms of operating profit. PlayStation has a MUCH higher profit margin than Netflix. For Q3 2020 Netflix posted $790M operating profit and PlayStation posted $988M operating profit. Revenue was was $6.44B for Netflix vs. $4.77B for PlayStation. (and btw Sony\u2019s mobile gaming revenue (\\~$1B / year) is under Sony Music, it is not even in those PlayStation numbers!!!)\n* Think about it. PlayStation alone posts bigger operating profit than Netflix (yes revenue is bit smaller, but it\u2019s the operating profit that matters most). And gaming is growing faster than movies. And PlayStation is about 24% of Sony\u2019s total revenue. And yet Netflix has a market cap that is equal to the double of Sony's market cap? Basically If you apply Netflix\u2019 valuation to PlayStation then PlayStation alone should have a bigger market cap than Netflix' market cap.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[PS+ growth and software digital ratio growth](https://preview.redd.it/73rskv8rp5d61.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=32b738f7858cfe652594f0c058cea149988b14c5)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Sony Vision-S & autonomous driving tech (selling sensors + infotainment system to other car manufacturers). Sony surprised everyone when they revealed their Sony Vision-S electric vehicle last year at CES 2020 (in-house design and made in cooperation with Magna Steyr). And it\u2019s currently being tested on public roads. Over the past year we have seen absurdly big investment hype into anything even remotely related to EV\u2019s (including a few questionable companies). We\u2019ve even seen an EV company with a gravity-powered truck get a $30B market cap in June last year. Meanwhile Sony, out of nowhere, revealed what is arguably (subjectively) one of the best looking EV\u2019s. It got very positive reception at CES 2020. An EV that you can actually drive. But somehow their stock is still dirt-cheap based on their current fundamentals alone? Yet some companies that had pretty much nothing but some EV design concepts got insane valuations purely due to hype?\n* LTE chips for IoT & Industry 4.0 (Altair Semiconductors)\n* Cross-media IP (The Last of Us show on HBO, Uncharted movie etc). Huge unrealized potential synergy here (it\u2019s about to change). We have seen that it can turn out super well when you look at The Witcher, Sonic the Hedgehog and Detective Pikachu. When The Witcher released on Netflix, sales of The Witcher 3 significantly increased again. Imagine the same thing, but with Sony IP\u2019s. Sony Pictures is currently working on 7 video game IP based TV shows and 3 movies. We know The Last of Us tv series is currently in production for HBO. And then the Uncharted is currently in post-production and scheduled to be released in July this year currently. If Uncharted turns out to be successful, it will mark a big, new milestone for Sony as an entertainment company imho.\n* Aniplex (Sony Music Entertainment Japan subsidiary for anime production, distribution & mobile games) had a fantastic year in 2020. (more on this later) There is a lot of room for mobile games growth with Aniplex. Thanks to Aniplex, Sony might beat their earnings forecast.\n* Drones. DJI just got put on Entity List in USA and Sony started developing drones for prosumer / professional a few years ago. Big opportunity for Sony here to take a bit from DJI\u2019s dominance. It only makes sense for Sony to enter the drone market targeting the professional & prosumer video market, considering Sony\u2019s established position in the professional audio/video/photography space\n* Currently Sony also has several ventures & investments in AI & robotics\n* Over the past decade, Sony has also carefully expanded into medical equipment tech & biotechnology. Worth noting that Sony also has an important 33% stake in M3 inc (a medical services through-the-internet company with a market cap of $65.5B) (= just their stake in M3 Inc is worth $22B alone, remember Sony, with their large, diversified revenue streams & assets only has a market cap of $128B?)\n* Sony Pictures has a great upcoming movie slate (MCU Spider-Man, Uncharted, Ghostbusters: Afterlife, Venom 2, Morbius, Spider-Verse sequel, Hotel Transylvania 4, Peter Rabbit 2, Vivo, The Nightingale). They will profit from the theatre reopening and covid recovery.

Considering the growing appetite for anime I honestly do not even understand why AT&T sold it, they could have integrated it with their other streaming service (HBO Max) but ok)\n* With Crunchyroll Sony now has the following anime empire:\n* Aniplex (anime production & distribution, subsidiary of Sony Music Entertainment Japan) F\n* Funimation\n* Manga Entertainment UK (production, licensing, and distribution, UK)\n* Wakanam (licensing and distribution in Europe)\n* AnimeLab (licensing and distribution in Australia & New Zealand)\n* Crunchyroll (3 million paying subcribers, 90 million registered users and 50 million social media followers)\n\n\\* Why anime matters:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Anime growth](https://preview.redd.it/kqcsrrl2q5d61.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=79867e066bbd3f156531d6becf62c3b5da62a36d)\n\n*\u201cThe global  size is expected to reach USD 36.26 billion by 2025, registering a CAGR of 8.8% over the forecast period, according to a study conducted by Grand View Research, Inc.

Fate/Grand order is the 7th most profitable mobile game in revenue worldwide as of 2020 (!)\n\n[Fate\\/Grand Order #9 game by revenue last year as of Q3 2020](https://preview.redd.it/8y1fa879q5d61.jpg?width=903&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=01ed784e832aea3a4376951363e27b684764e058)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Aniplex launched Disney: Twisted Wonderland in March this year. In Q3, it was the #10 most downloaded mobile game in Japan. (Aniplex now has two top ten games in Japan)\n* Fate/Grand Order was the #2 most tweeted game in 2020 and #3 was Disney: Twisted Wonderland. You can see that Aniplex has two hugely successful mobile games. (we are talking close to $1B of revenue a year here). It is the #2 game in Japan by total revenue from Q1 2016 to Q3 2020 and the #9 game in worldwide revenue from Q1 2020 to Q3 2020.\n\n[Aniplex has two very popular mobile games](https://preview.redd.it/t0gx0qvhq5d61.jpg?width=1379&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7898cc330fc56ab3369e0f2becf5199b84dc0ec5)\n\n* SMEJ earns about > $1B from mobile games in revenue from mobile games and there is still a lot of future growth potential here considering Japan\u2019s mobile game market grew a whopping 32% yoy from Q3 2019 to Q3 2020.\n* Aniplex recently co-distrubuted the movie ***Demon Slayer: Mugen Train*** in Japan in October 2020. It became the highest grossing film of all time in Japan with a total gross box office revenue of $380M. In the middle of a pandemic. It still needs to release in South Korea, China and USA where it will most likely do great as well.  \n\n  \n\n**Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE) (Game & Netwerk Services business unit):**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* We all know 2020 was a huge year for video games with the stay-at-home pandemic boost. The whole video game sector brought in $180B of revenue in 2020, a whopping 20% increase yoy. \n* But 2020 will not be just a one-off temporary exceptional year for video games. The video game market has a CAGR of 13% which means it will be worth $291B in 2027. Video games is by far the segment with the highest growth rate in the whole entertainment industry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[US video game market growth \\(worldwide growth has a 13&#37; CAGR\\)](https://preview.redd.it/ft0tnddmr5d61.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=1b5cfe6bd6fafc65fe94a3fe4665bdc9d45e4fb7)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[PlayStation revenue and operating profit growth](https://preview.redd.it/un0um4i3s5d61.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=f453280cb4ecdc016961871279f2461a9c8579c8)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* PlayStation obviously has a huge piece of this pie and over the past years has seen consistent yoy revenue and profit growth. Think about it, for every FIFA/Call of Duty/Assassin\u2019s Creed sold on PS4/PS5, Sony gets a 30% cut. There have been sold a billion PS4 games so far.\n* 5 years ago 20 to 30% of PS4 games were purchased digitally. Flashforward to 2020 and it\u2019s 60-75% and the digital ratio looks set to still increase a bit. This means higher profit margin for game publishers and for Sony at the expense of retailers\n* SIE has seen huge success in its first-party games over the past 5 years. Spider-Man, God of War, Horizon: Zero Dawn, The Last of Us Part 2, Uncharted 4, Ghost of Tsushima, Days Gone, Ratchet & Clank have all been huge successes. This is really big and represents a big change compared to the previous generations where Sony never really hit it big as a games publisher even though most of their games were considered quality games.\n* SIE is now not only a powerful platform holder/provider, but also a very successful games publisher with popular IP\u2019s (Uncharted, God of War, The Last of Us, Horizon, Ghost of Tsushima, Ratchet & Clank). This is an enormous asset, because firstly it increases the chances of success for cross-media opportunities (Sony Pictures can make TV shows and movies out of it to expand the popularity of those IP\u2019s even more). And secondly, it is an obvious selling point for PS5. The more popular and bigger their exclusive content, the more they can draw people to their platform/service. This should increases PS5 total marketshare over its competitor.\n* The hype for God of War: Ragnarok will be absolutely through the roof. Hype for Horizon: Forbidden West is also very good already (10 million yt views, 273K likes which is very good). Gran Turismo 7 and Ratchet & Clank will also do very well in 2021. (I suspect that GoW or/and Horizon might be delayed to 2022) \n*  PS5 reception has been extremely good. Demand is through the roof as well all know. The only problem is that they cannot quite capitalize on the demand due to lack of supply, but overall, it is a very good thing that demand is very high, and that reception has been very positive. The challenge will primarily supply and production-related for the following 6 months and to be able to maintain brand momentum. Hopefully, they won\u2019t push disappointed/inpatient customers to competitors.\n* Considering there\u2019s backwards compatibility from PS4 to PS5, users will want all their PSN content to transition with them as well, so I expect them to lose very little marketshare to Xbox. Also, I do not know if Americans realize it, but Xbox is not nearly as big as PlayStation in the rest of the world as it is in the USA. PlayStation just has global brand power that Xbox just doesn\u2019t have, so Xbox isn\u2019t much of threat at all I\u2019d say. Where I live, in Belgium, In Europe everyone is talking about the PS5, nobody really seems to care about Xbox Series S/X that much. Comparing PlayStation to Xbox in terms of mindshare is like comparing Apple to Motorola (not meant to be a diss to Motorola, I have a Motorola phone myself, just saying that Xbox has significantly less mindshare / brand power in Europe).\n* SIE is likely working on PSVR 2, this could be big.\n* Sony has a small stake in Epic Games (1.4%) and they have a good business relationship with them, so this might also make them open to release first-party games on Epic Games Store after exclusivity period on PS5.\n* Remember the Travis Scott concert in Fortnite? I believe that was one of the reasons why Sony invested in Epic Games. It serves as an example how music can sometimes converge with video games, and this can play to Sony\u2019s strengths.\n* PlayStation also has way superior presence in Asia compared to Xbox. Have been expanding into China as well. Another great opportunity for revenue growth.\n* PS+ subscribers grew from 5.7 million by the end of 2013 to 46 million by October 30th, 2020. This is an average growth rate of 28% over the past 5 years. Considering most of the growth was early on, it will slow down, but I predict that they will have about 70 million PS+ subscribers by the end of 2023. This is huge and represents a stable, recurring source of income. Investors who keep hyping Netflix/Disney+ will love this, but it seems they have yet to discover $SNE.\n* There is a reason why Amazon, Google, Nvidia have been aggressively investing in video games & games streaming. They know the business is huge and is about to get even bigger. But considering the established, loyal PlayStation userbase, the established global brand of PlayStation and the exclusive games, PlayStation should be able to easily standoff competition from Amazon, Google and Nvidia (GeForce Now) in the next few years. So far, Amazon\u2019s venture into game development, publishing & streaming has completely failed. Stadia and GeForceNow seem to have a bit more success, but still relatively niche. Therefore, I think PlayStation is well-positioned to remain one of the leaders in the industry for the following decade.\n\nI'll get to the other divisions later, I figured this is  a good first step.\n\nBut so far the tl;dr\n\nImage sensors: \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nIoT/Industry 4.0 chipsets: \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nPS5/PSN/PS+: \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nOnline medical services (M3 inc.): \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nAnime: \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nFate/Grand Order: \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nDemon Slayer: Mugen Train \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nSony Music / music streaming (the performance of Sony Music\u2019s in Sony\u2019s business is seriously understated.

Nobody was allowed to do any business with Huawei. Huawei, being one of the world's biggest smartphone manufacturers, was one of Sony's most important clients for image sensors (Huawei alone was 20% of Sony's image sensor business). It got wiped away in a very short amount of time and Sony had to take a 168M inventory write-down last quarter because of this. The semiconductor business in general is not highly flexible and very capital-intensive, so this sucks for Sony, because first they couldn't meet very high demand for image sensors and they prioritized their biggest clients (Apple and Huawei) and this year it has backfired because of the Huawei ban.\n\n([https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sony-t-image-sensors-fast-235405814.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sony-t-image-sensors-fast-235405814.html) )\n\nThe fact that Sony couldn't meet demand last year has allowed Samsung's image sensors to gain contracts with other manufacturers (Xiaomi; they used to go with Sony sensors before but they signed with Samsung in 2019). And now Samsung is currently investing a lot of money in its image sensor business.\n\nIt is possible that on the long-term Sony will lose market share to Samsung. But on the other hand, Sony is also doubling down on its image sensors ($6.4B investment in 3 years) (they're opening a new plant in Japan this year)(new sensors for automotive, industry automation, security & surveillance)(they already provide sensors & image analytics for these industries, but it's a small part of their sales compared to smartphone image sensors)(this is what I explained in my OP)\n\nIn late October, Sony was allowed to sell image sensors to Huawei again.\n\n**tl;dr** because of Huawei ban, **Sony's image sensors business was significantly less profitable in 2020 and they also risk losing short-term and possibly long-term market share to Samsung, in part because of the Huawei ban.**\n\nYou can read more here: [https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Companies/Samsung-to-challenge-Sony-s-stronghold-in-image-sensor-market](https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Companies/Samsung-to-challenge-Sony-s-stronghold-in-image-sensor-market)\n\nThere's some good news as well, because according to DigiTime Apple & Sony signed a 3-year contract for Sony to supply the next generations of iPhones with its image sensors.\n\nBut overall, Sony's image sensor should bounce back strongly on the mid-term as other smartphone manufacturers will fill Huawei's void + the demand in other sectors is projected to increase.", "score": 7, "replies": [], "tickers": ["aapl"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["nflx"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Fuck should go in when they were at $68 last year might jump in for shares", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.37428396940231323}, {"body": "Good write up", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2994135320186615}, {"body": "Sony developing mechas when?", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.30059710144996643}, {"body": "I read like 90 percent until I was sold.

We knew home entertainment demand in general was high. Yet they still delivered much better results than I anticipated. Very good results across every single division and the outlook is very good.\n\nWhen they sell PS5 at a profit in 1-2 years, PlayStation profits are going to be much higher, but revenue growth might slow down a bit. They have to be selling the digital PS5 at a huge loss considering it is $100 cheaper than the PS5 with disc drive and both versions are sold at loss. (the disc drive would only add max $35-40 to the BOM I think). I honestly don't understand Sony's logic for selling the PS5 digital edition at such a huge loss when they can't even come remotely close to meeting demand. I suspect $450 for the digital edition would have been received well, would likely be more proportional to the manufacturing costs and would still be 10% cheaper than the Xbox Series X.\n\nTheir rationale is of course that people who buy the digital edition are going to be buying digital games which have higher margins. But still, why sell something at a really big loss at $400 when you can't meet demand anyway and when you'd still be cheaper than your competitor at $450?\n\nBut anyway, I'm so bullish on Sony right now across every single division.\n\nI've continued doing my DD as I can and I'm even more bullish than 2 weeks ago. It should be a $200B market cap company already.

Their synergies actually are coming together and imo they should trade at more like a 25 p/e. So much room left to run.\n\nIve gone through Sony's earnings presentation like 3 times and my mind is blown by the quality of earnings each time. Their executives run a very profitable and tight ship. The executive team is perhaps what makes me most bullish about sony than anything else. \n\nTheir business to business products are just as great as their B2C products as well and I think is a pretty big part of the growth story. Their audio/visual tech is just a game changer, I know that The Mandalorian used exclusively sony video tech that is literally replacing the green screen which is pretty amazing.\n\nTheir music division is also just going bonanzas, Streaming has made any sort of piracy such a fringe thing again in just a few years it is truly incredible. Sony music is cashing fat royalty/licensing checks fron FB, Youtube, Spotify, Instagram, TikTok, etc. They are the I think 3rd largest label and THE largest music publishing company in the world. \n\nI agree with your points about gaming to a degree, why not charge more with such a supply constraint, but I feel like they just have like corporate PTSD from blowing their huge PS2 lead with the PS3. Now it isnt a totally straightforward comparison, but I dont mind them erring on the side of caution in terms of pricing. I mean they are going to profit more than 25B over the lifespan of the console barring any sort of unforeseen dosaster imo. Especially with the price of PS5 games going up ten bucks for the first time in more than ten years. I also believe Sony said that the PS5 will be break even in 2021 if a customer buys even one periphereal and they are beginning to push (profitable) PS5 bundles I read somewhere. More good news for the gaming division is that so far 87% of PS5 customers have signed up for PS+. I bet they will have 60 million paying PS+ subscribers by Q4 2023.\n\nSemi conductors division will be just fine. There are just too many potential applications and customers for the whole Huawei thing to be an long term issue no matter what happens there. Sony is going ahead with plans to start construction on a new image sensor factory so I think they are pretty confident in terms of demand. I mean their products literally allow machines to see lol.

IMO PC gaming is the future, but more on that another time.\n\nI think this is a great point and I have thought about this too. However, the success of PS4 and instant sell-out of PS5 clearly shows that there is still a ton of interest in consoles, despite PC gaming having a lot of advantages.\n\nI do think that PC gaming has many advantages over console gaming (bigger library, more flexibility (upgrade hardware whenever you want), endless customization options, better prices for games in general and online multiplayer is not locked behind paywall),.\n\nBut despite that I still don't really see console gaming going away anytime soon. This is not what the numbers in general have shown. PC gaming has always had the advantages mentioned for over a decade, but console gaming still grew over the past 10 years.\n\nConsoles and PC gaming are both profiting for the growing gaming market as a whole, this is what market analysis shows I think. (I think it's also a very good idea to invest in companies that are more exposed to the PC gaming market btw, such as AMD, but also a publisher like Ubisoft (Ubisoft is quite undervalued compared to EA, ATVI and TTWO and they're about to crush earnings forecast, I'm 100% sure Ubi will jump after earnings report. Not so sure that Sony will beat their earnings forecast, but that's because they already drastically raised it in October. But long-term I'm very bullish on SNE as it's hopefully clear by now xD)\n\nConsoles also have the FIFA/COD/Madden audience by the balls and I don't see that audience switching to PC. FIFA/COD/Madden sells tens of millions of units each year. FIFA is an enormous cash cow for EA and when you look at the numbers all the revenue pretty much comes from PS4, a bit from Xbox and barely anything from PC. Same thing with Madden.\n\nIt not just the \"mainstream\" audience, but it's clear that consoles also attracts the core gamers. (otherwise games like Death Stranding, Demon's Souls, Horizon etc wouldn't perform as well as they do in terms of sales).\n\nThis lead to me to believe that consoles will always have a lot of appeal. Otherwise the PS5 wouldn't be instantly sold out at launch. And otherwise demand wouldn't be through the roof. Same thing with Nintendo Switch where demand is through the roof. PS4 + Xbox One sales surpass PS3 + Xbox 360 sales launch aligned, so I don't think console gaming is going away anytime soon, though I totally undertand your point.\n\nNext I'd add that honestly, I'd say the value proposition of the PS5 compared to PC gaming is also really good. Compared to PS4, not so much, but it's impossible to beat PS5 for $400 with the same budget for a gaming PC. (granted, a PC is multi-purpose so you can't really compare it 1 to 1). This makes me think that consoles provide a lower barrier of entry to video games than PC gaming.\n\nOn top of that, it's clear that Sony is doubling down on exclusive content so that's another USP they have. God of War, Uncharted, Spider-Man etc. Those games have been pulling in big numbers so it's clearly an important asset that Sony has.\n\nI do think SIE should be very vigilent that PC gaming + Google Stadia + Amazon Luna + GeForce Now etc don't eat their lunch even if PlayStation is in an upwards trend. Going by their IR releases, Sony is very aware of this and they also have their own streaming service (PS Now) that they actually started way before Google and Amazon.\n\nFinally, I'll add that Sony Corporation as a whole (so not the PlayStation business) is actually looking to make acquisitions in the gaming market, seperate from PlayStation business. Some people still seem to have the idea that Sony is a cash-poor company, but they actually have $40B in cash on hand.\n\nThis is evidenced by the fact that they made a bit to acquire Leyou (company that owns the developer behind Warframe, along with other stuff). This was a bid made by Sony Corporation and not by Sony Interactive Entertainment (PlayStation).\n\n[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-07-03-sony-considering-a-bid-for-digital-extremes-owner-leyou](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-07-03-sony-considering-a-bid-for-digital-extremes-owner-leyou)\n\n>For the short term 1-2 years, I\u2019m bullish, but in 5 years I wouldn\u2019t want to be holding this stock unless they can make some serious measurable progress in the EV space that counteracts their businesses that are reaching maturity (growing at slower rates)\n\nAlong with the stock being fundamentally undervalued, their imaging/vision sensing prowess is one of the main reasons why I'm long on Sony as I've hopefully somewhat outlined in the OP.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Well said, you\u2019ve made an investor out of me xD", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.29652613401412964}], "tickers": ["amd", "amzn"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["nflx"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Holy shit my finger got tired from scrolling.
