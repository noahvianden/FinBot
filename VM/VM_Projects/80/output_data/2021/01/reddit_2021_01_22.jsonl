{"title": "Understanding Blackberry (Limited knowledge of soccer required)", "selftext": "\n \nBlackberry is like that glorious team that won everything in the past and then got beaten so bad that it disappeared into the oblivion.. They had to face the reality, they got relegated so bad  into lower leagues.. for years now they have been playing the most boring football with 6-3-1 Diego Simeone park the bus formation. \n\nRecently the owner and the manager have been following the news and seeing all their old mates killing it and breaking records here and there.. They decided its now the time to wake up from the Alberta hibernation they have been in and play beautiful football again. \n \nFirst Step: They got rid of all the has-beens and the deadwood in the team.. shipped them all on a permanent deal to Guangzhou Evergrande Taobao F.C.\n \n \nNow who is going to be the scorer? Who is going to be MVP? \n \nSo this sad miserable team for years have always had this wonder kid.. A Neymar, Who they played as Center Back in their park the bus ultra conservative game plan.\n \nHere is how it happened. \n \nMost car electronics like AC control or Engine oil sensors notifications are done through a software.. this software processes the inputs through an ECU. Most cars have a single function ECU. It\u2019s 8 Bit or 16 Bit ECU that can\u2019t process much.  \n \nQNX is way more advanced. They have domain ECU, it can process several functions at the same time. It\u2019s a processor and a computer that is capable of a lot of stuff but It\u2019s just sitting there inside your car showing you your tire alignment.\nThis is exactly like having an iphone 12 pro and using it as a calculator. Or having Neymar in your team as a Center Back. \n\nWhy didn\u2019t Blackberry develop it to be do more stuff all these years?\n\nBecause they wanted it to be safe. Blackberry wanted QNX to be known as the safe reliable solution. It\u2019s that safe system that wont distract the driver, or lock him inside by mistake, or get hacked. It\u2019s a boomer strategy. They never had issues or malfunctions and they always deliver on time. Clients didn\u2019t ask for a better solution, so Blackberry never revolutionized it.\n \nThey now see Tesla dashboard capable of doing all these fun and profitable stuff.. They decided to join the party. They are going to use the full capacity of QNX. \n\nNeymar is going to play upfront. Will get all the support and all the freedom to perform in a big league with the big boys. \n\nEven when Jeff Bizos heard that they are finally going to play that wonder kid upfront and he came to pose and take a picture with him and invited him to play a charity game at Amazon. \n \nAmazon deal with Blackberry is just Amazon trying to be in the picture. They want to associated with Blackberry in any capacity. They are the cloud host of the data that Blackberry is going gather from the vehicles with the new QNX and make it available online for whoever is going to need it. Its nothing and probably wont be profitable. It\u2019s publicity.. A charity game. \n\n\n\n1. First car that will have the new QNX will launch in 2023. (Fact)\n\n2. I think car makers expect Tesla are going to have QNX. QNX has always delivered on time and its safe and cant be hacked.\n\n3. 19 car makers have had a joint venture today. The big names of the joint venture like Jeep already using QNX. I expect the rest are going to follow.\n\n4. The fees car makers pay are going to doubled. (Fact)\n\n5. The new system will allow to host third party apps with subscriptions.. like app store and android. (Fact)\n\nI think its fair to say that Blackberry is going to be a $ 100 Bn company.. it\u2019s imminent. \n\nThey will now have a Tesla run.. they will have a Fiverr kind of run or Cloudflare.", "id": "l2z1x4", "created_utc": 1611355481.0, "score": 148, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 84, "comments": [{"body": "Just going to put some rockets to translate for the spastics that can\u2019t read past \u2018Blackberry\u2019 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80", "score": 54, "replies": [{"body": "TLDR: \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80", "score": 8, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.12560240924358368}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4792136549949646}, {"body": "BlackBerry is going to become Real Madrid in the business world.
