In this example, if you sell a higher strike call to expire on the same DTE, it'll be setup as a debit call spread. You do not need to setup a spread at the same time. This is what is termed \"legging in\" the long or short trades to make a spread.\n\n>  Do you have to set it so it expire on the same date or you can sell a shorter date?  \n\nYou can, but why?

Thanks so much\n\nNo, you have the option to close at any time, but once you set up a spread, you are often locked in until expiration because if the spot price does not at least get to the long calls' strike price + premium, you're running a loss.

For example, if you buy 100 shares you can sell to open a call at a Strike Price well above the then-Share Price.  At the end of the week you get to keep a premium paid to you for doing so AND you get to keep  your shares if the Strike Price hasn\u2019t triggered a sale of your shares.  If you think the Strike Price is looking like it will be hit, you can \u201cbuy to close\u201d your open position, or just let the shares be purchased from you at the Strike Price, allowing you to buy another 100 shares at a reduced price when including the premium you were paid.  \n\nGood luck!", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6661103963851929}, {"body": "OTM options accelerate their decay well in advance of expiration.
