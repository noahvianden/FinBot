{"title": "Does ThetaGang Beat The Market?", "selftext": "So I've been scrolling this forum for about a month or two now, since I started writing puts and a combination of spreads. So far, I've done pretty well, but when I look at how the market has performed over the same time frame, it makes me question how much I can really attribute to skill. I understand that I'm new to this, don't have a great skillset or sample size to accurately assess theta gang strategies, and I'm certainly grateful for turning a profit. But it's just hard for me not to fall into the whole defeatist \"don't bother trying to beat the market\" mentality. I figured that I would ask the more experienced members of this thread for more information, as I don't know how to assess these strategies in the context of a bull market, and if it's worth the time.", "id": "mi6cs0", "created_utc": 1617315066.0, "score": 50, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 81, "comments": [{"body": "One month is not enough to know... anything whatsoever.

That is to say, the premium available on options writing, over long time scales, ought to be exactly offset by the losses associated with the risks of option writing (in terms of losses due to assignment, as well as time value of money due to locking up cash/equities if applicable), and on top of that you are less than the market due to applicable option or margin fees.  With the assumption options are fairly priced, whether you're writing random options on random securities, or a carefully curated strategy, the EV should still just match the market less fees, the only thing changing is risk profile.\n\nSo it seems more than option \"strategy\" you need the ability to identify inefficiently priced options.

Being the software provider for 23 out of 25 top EV automakers, Blackberry will also experience the same explosive growth soon.\n\nUpgrading train and road infrastructure might imply the adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) and Vehicle to Infrastructure communication (V2X) to enhance logistical/traffic management for better energy efficiency, productivity and public safety. As major infrastructure becomes connected to the internet, security will be a major requirement because these infrastructure will become hackable surfaces that can cause serious damage. Blackberry is the leading software provider for mission critical applications, IoT cybersecurity and Unified Endpoints Management (UEM) that has a great track record working closely with governments across the world. The [US military](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/the-united-states-air-force-chooses-blackberry-spark-for-secure-productivity-802136475.html) and [NASA](https://www.militaryaerospace.com/computers/article/16707929/space-shuttle-uses-qnx-software-for-camera) have been Blackberry/QNX's major customers for a long time.\n\nIt is very likely that Blackberry will win major government contracts soon in this space given its technical expertise in the IoT space and huge engineering workforce in the US.\n\nPosition: 7200 @ $11.77", "id": "mhqk13", "created_utc": 1617264285.0, "score": 299, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 82, "comments": [{"body": "Isnt BB a Canadian company? \n\n10750 @ $13", "score": 51, "replies": [{"body": "Yes, it is Canadian.

Blackberry even has a dedicated [subsidiary](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/industries/defense-military#hero) in Washington, D.C. that serves the US government, so it is well-positioned to help the government execute any high-tech infrastructure projects that requires safety and security.", "score": 65, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you for taking the time to explain it this way.
