For the uninitiated, please check out BlackRock-Ageddon in Yeet no. 1\n\n**Refresher**: *BlackRock ETFs ICLN/INRG track the SPDJI Clean Energy ETF, an index that has a high concentration in only 30 holdings.  After consultations, they have decided it\u2019s time to expand, so that the performance of a small number of companies don\u2019t overly influence the entire index.  On 4/19, the changes will take effect, and on 4/2 they produced an internal document of pro-formas. As a tracker of this index, BlackRock ETFs ICLN/INRG will need to purchase and sell significant portions of their holdings.*\n\n\n[ICLN Top Ten Holdings](https://i.imgur.com/g6O3EAs.jpg)\n\n****\n\nWhen calling the SPDJI on Friday for the pro-forma files, I was stonewalled.  There was a workaround found by our newest Research Associate, the incredible /u/sublette313, that allowed us to get crucial info, but we\u2019ll get to that in a moment.  First I want to give our further thinking and highlight reader feedback, and present what\u2019s logical by process of elimination.  These are our wrenches:\n\n**Dark Pools and Blocks:** lots of the necessary movement will happen through dark pools and block sells, making this less of an \u201coh shit, we\u2019re going to watch all this dump live!\u201d scenario, and more a shady slow-burn of shifting.  There is still many-a-play, but it will be more subtle than some kind of Y2K.\n\n**The lack of pro-forma files** released publicly means that what we have is a very, very strong hunch on what will be added to the index.  But we got a research assist (below).\n\n**The most profitable way to play this in our estimation is shares or calls in the tickers to be added with the smallest market caps**.  These, logically, would be the biggest movers as they would be greatly influenced not only by the required institutional purchasing happening in clandestine ways, but also a) the news cycle and wider release of information and b) the literal, additional purchase benefits of being an added ticker to the index.  \n\nIn the first DD we provided a document from SPDJI called a \u201c[consultation](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/indexnews/announcements/20210312-1335572/1335572_spglobalcleanenergyconsultexpscorecountweightingupdated3-12-2021.pdf)\u201d, which really means \u201cupdated blueprint\u201d.  /u/sublette313 really dug into this, and here\u2019s what he found.  Inside the \u201c[consultation](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/indexnews/announcements/20210312-1335572/1335572_spglobalcleanenergyconsultexpscorecountweightingupdated3-12-2021.pdf)\u2019 and boy was it a jackpot if you had the patience to keep looking.\n\nThe \u201c**Eligible Universe Summary (Oct 20)**\u201d tab of the spreadsheet gives us a list of 74 potential adds identified by SPDJI.  Okay, AND...\nThe \u201c**Current Consultation\u201d** [gives us a list of 68 tickers identified by SPDJI this month.](https://i.imgur.com/iiNDDYz.jpg) \nI\u2019ll wait a moment for you to click the \u2018current consultation\u2019 tab, in red.  Find what I\u2019ve labeled here as\u2026.`[YES](https://i.imgur.com/0xH4cuF.jpg)\u2019.\n\n**Now, I\u2019m not necessarily saying this is an exact list of many of the current companies THAT ALSO INCLUDES A BUNCH OF NEW COMPANIES to be added with the proposed weighting.  What I AM saying is that this is a selection of energy companies...chosen by SPDJI...with a \u2018hypothetical\u2019 list of energy stocks that have had new weighting applied...in a tab called current consultation...that are filtered from a tab THEY\u2019VE labeled \u201chypothetical universe\u201d.**  \n\nThere\u2019s also a **cool column here to the right** that G pointed out. It can help you screen by showing what percentage of the stock would be at owned 5, 10, or 15 billion ownership stake.  [This tells what companies (small) can be most affected by coming purchasing\u2014 \u2018the good shit\u2019](https://i.imgur.com/WzStwmy.jpg)\n\n****\n\nWe\u2019ve sorted through, and this is the list that sticks out to us.  We did not just throw a dart--these choices reflect some combination of UOA, RAMBO, charting, fundament---AW WHO AM I KIDDING. HELL, WE LIKE THE STOCK!:\n\n**For calls we like:**\n\n**The low-cap (~5b and under) tickers listed in the \u2018Current Consultation\u2019**: FCEL, SPWR, CWEN, TPIC\n\n**A grade** in \u201ccurrent consultation\u201d: PCG\n\nB grade in \u201ccurrent consultation\u201d: FCEL, SPWR, JKS\n\n**Honorable mention that didn\u2019t make it in the consultation:** BE\n\n**Notably not included in the consultation**: BLNK, VST\n\n**VERY BULLISH NEE REGARDLESS**\n\n**We are also bearish on PLUG** still with this development, but will need to update particulars pending more looks at purchase volume and flow PM Monday. \n\n**Watch List **- option chain doesn't offer any clues/illiquid, but everyone should be on the lookout for UOA: IDA, ENIA, ORA, HE, AVA, AY, ELP, DQ, ROCK, TPIC, GPRE\n\n**We will monitor UOA and open interest on these tickers starting Monday.** What this DD showed is that it\u2019s not what\u2019s in the news, but it\u2019s in the way that you use it.\n\n**TLDR: PCG FCEL, SPWR, CWEN, TPIC** calls, **PLUG** puts but it\u2019s probably gonna have a little dead kitten action after its dump since the first one of these DDs\n\n*NOTE: This is from this past weekend\u2019s The YEET newsletter*", "id": "mm8e3g", "created_utc": 1617819620.0, "score": 148, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 78, "comments": [{"body": "I feel even more retarded after attempting to read this", "score": 40, "replies": [{"body": "\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02 It had me stumped at BlackRock,,,", "score": 5, "replies": [], "tickers": ["blk"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.21438224613666534}, {"body": "I hit PCG pretty hard with calendar spreads\n\nThis can\u2019t go tits up like my last 10 option plays I got from here", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "Their exposure score is 0.75 so they won\u2019t be bought as heavily by this ETF.
