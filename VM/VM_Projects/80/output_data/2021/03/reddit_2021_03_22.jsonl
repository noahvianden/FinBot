{"title": "The Wolf of Wall Street Says You're Getting Fleeced By The Brokers and Market Makers", "selftext": "As more retail investors become interested in investing in the financial markets, the more information available to the general public, the better.\n\nRecently, there have been some [Congressional hearings in the US](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/17/business/gamestop-hearing.html) in the wake of the ongoing Gamestop saga in which questions have been  raised over the practice of Payment for Order Flow (PFOF) which has become more common and a core part of the business model for no commission trading pioneered by Robinhood.\n\nWhile  PFOF is not a new practice, it is seemingly becoming more common as  more brokerages follow Robinhood's model in order to compete for the burgeoning retail trading business.  At least in the US, it appears fewer brokerages are now offering the traditional commission based trading structure:  Fidelity, Merrill Edge, Interactive Brokers (but not their newer \"IBKR Lite\" platform) are some examples (are there more?).\n\nPFOF is banned in at least two other jurisdictions: the UK and Canada.\n\nRightly maligned for his prior fradulent behaviour in his pump and dump \"boiler-room\" schemes where he took up to $200 million from investors, the infamous \"Wolf of Wall Street\" recently gave an interview in which  he discussed the topic at hand, shedding a bit more light on the practice:\n\n[Fortune interview with Jordan Belfort, the \"Wolf of Wall Street\"](https://fortune.com/2021/03/21/bitcoin-stock-market-jordan-belfort-small-investors-wolf-of-wall-street-interview/)\n\n>\"It's the most expensive 'free trade' you can have,\" says Belfort. \"I saw a marketing demo from one of the big 'free trades' players advertising  how they were 'helping the little guy,' and they're hand in hand with the big guys. It was like a betrayal of trust.\" He says that market makers pay so much for order flow because it gives them an exclusive  window into where the market is moving. When firms see tons of orders coming in for Tesla, they can purchase shares for their own account, pushing up the EV-maker's prices for their clients when the next flood of orders arrives. \"Order flow is everything,\" he says. \"It tells you where the market is going next. It gives the high-frequency market makers a crystal ball and puts the small investor at a big information    disadvantage. Seeing all that order flow gives a market maker information that the public doesn't have.\"  \n>  \n>..  \n>  \n>In his example, if the market maker buys XYZ at $50.01 and sells at $50.09, it makes a fat, 8\u00a2 spread. But if the firm \"worked the order\" by seeking buyers willing to pay a bit more, it could purchase for on behalf of its client at $50.05, and sell at $50.06. The seller gets 4\u00a2 more, the buyer gets 3\u00a2 off, and the trade costs the little guy just 1\u00a2 instead of 8\u00a2. \"Traders' compensation depends on marking up trades and  keeping wide spreads,\" he says. \"You'd have to be Mother Teresa not to fall for that temptation.\"\n\n[How Robinhood (and the other brokerages that have followed them) Make Money on Trades Despite Taking No Commissions](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/13/how-robinhood-makes-money-on-customer-trades-despite-making-it-free.html)\n\n[Bloomberg Opinion Article on Payment for Order Flow](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-02-05/robinhood-gamestop-saga-pressures-payment-for-order-flow)\n\n[Investopedia Article: What is Payment for Order Flow?](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/paymentoforderflow.asp)\n\n>..payment for order flow is a practice pioneered by [Bernard Madoff](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bernard-madoff.asp)\u2014the same Madoff of Ponzi scheme notoriety.  \n>  \n>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said, in a [special study](https://www.sec.gov/news/studies/ordpay.htm) on PFOF published in December 2000, \u201cPayment for order flow is a method of transferring some of the trading profits from market making to the brokers that route customer orders to specialists for execution.\u201d\u00a0\n\n[Payment for Order Flow is banned in the UK](https://www.cfainstitute.org/en/advocacy/policy-positions/payment-for-order-flow-in-the-united-kingdom)\n\n[Payment for Order Flow is also prohibited in Canada](https://www.gbm.scotiabank.com/content/dam/gbm/market-insights/etf/october/2019-10-02-Free-Trading.pdf)\n\nThe SEC ultimately decided against banning the practice in the US, citing the potential benefit to investors in encouraging competition that would presumably increase execution quality.\n\nOne last link: [the SEC charged Robinhood in 2020 for misleading customers about revenue sources and failing to satisfy the duty of best execution (fining them $65 million).](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-321)\n\nWhat are your thoughts on PFOF?

{"title": "DD Boomer Edition:Canadian Pacific to Merge with Kansas City Railroad. \ud83d\ude82 I am autistic so I like the trains.", "selftext": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/railroads-strike-a-25-billion-merger-11616330332\n\nCanadian Pacific has been trying to make a major purchase of a US railroad for years that would allow them a clean path between Mexico and Canada.  They want badly to be the USMCA railroad and have been put down by regulators multiple times despite raising cash for huge companies like Norfolk Southern.\n\nUS regulators have been blocking it because their buyouts would have arguably reduced market options and railroads are the one piece of semi-public assets the US still seems to be on board with protecting.  This small $25 billion dollar deal resolves the problem because instead of picking up a major rail network Canadian Pacific brokered a deal with a short line  \ud83e\ude73\u2796railroad service.  \n\nIn this case the Kansas City Southern is a very limited route with half of it's rail in mexico and it's US rail being simple long isolated stretches rather than the web a company like Norfolk provides.  So the primary regulatory concern is gone and from an international trade standpoint this would actually be a win.\n\nOther Factors: \n\nRailroads are good recovery stocks.  Supply lines and distribution are a mess with back logs right now.  Ports are backed up, raw materials are missing and Texas getting shutdown by the storm hit a number of industries in that area hard.  Rail lines provide the ability to move large amounts of freight at lower prices than any other method on the globe.  \n\nRailways are also increasingly green technology.  They were already the most efficient transportation method on the market but the technology keeps improving and railways has lots of incentive to adapt as energy costs are one of the major factors in their profits.  This means the industry likely doesn't see any pain coming out of the Biden administration and can likely get a piece of an alleged infrastructure bill.\n\nBoomer Points:\n\nRailways give dividends!  Thats extra money in your pocket.  Great secure industry that isn't going anywhere.  Millennials may be afraid of \ud83d\ude82 but they need trains to move \ud83e\udd51\ud83c\udf5e and the less millennials talk about an industry the less likely they are to try to cancel it.   Rail is secure and GROWING.  \n\nRailways are simple and easy to understand.  People need to move things and \ud83d\ude82 are \ud83d\udcaa alone.  \n\nThis would literally be a new transcontinental railroad just in the other direction!  It is \ud83d\ude82 history in the making!\n\nWarnings : The last two merger attempts by CP failed.  This is their third shot at an end goal of getting direct access lines tied together between the USMCA counties.  Probably the most likely to succeed but no guarantee.\n\nRail is slow and that makes it vulnerable to other developments in the transit market (see self driving electric trucks).  The market is strong and showing promise but needs to push it's own technology forward to remain competitive long term.  Not to say they aren't trying but the auto industry has way more Engineers.\n\nPositions;. Currently none.  Merger was announced today.  Calls are pricey but I'm going to try to buy in early Monday.

Why would you bet against and essentially cap the potentially massive gains in a squeeze situation if that's the whole reason you bought it in the first place? It doesn't make any sense to me. People buy GME right now because they are looking for massive gains in a potential squeeze situation, and I don't understand the point of capping your gains. If you are willing to do that, why the hell would you even buy GME in the first place? Isn't it in his best interest to maximize his gains for a massive squeeze to not happen? At least, not until they expire which is going to keep increasing if he keeps rolling out his calls? If so, why bother with such a stupidly volatile stock that is frankly, at 200 dollars overvalued by a factor of 4 or 5, instead of a better, more sound alternative? You aren't buying GME for the fundamentals, at least not right now, you buy it hoping it will run up. Why would you bet against that? \n\nAnd yes, I suppose it could technically be called downside protection, but if you are selling CC's because you are afraid of the downside with GME, a stock that went from 350 to 172 in a matter of days, then you're probably buying the wrong stock.
