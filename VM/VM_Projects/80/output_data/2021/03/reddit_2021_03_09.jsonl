{"title": "Academy Sports and Outdoors, more than a Short Squeeze Opportunity", "selftext": "\n\nAcademy Sports and Outdoors (Ticker : ASO) isn\u2019t just the next Rocket or Gamestop. You shouldn\u2019t view them as simply a squeeze opportunity. If you\u2019re looking for just a squeeze and quick 100% gains without ever thinking about the stock again, this isn\u2019t the post for you, it holds lots of info but I\u2019m not spamming rocket emojis and this isn\u2019t a P&amp;D scheme. \n\nAcademy Sports and Outdoors is a retailer of sporting goods based out of Katy, Texas which is just to the west of Houston. They\u2019ve been mostly concentrated in the Houston area, but recently have been expanding into areas throughout the Southern US. During their expansion their careful selection of store locations \u201chas been that it has never had to close one of its new stores, all of which have been profitable since their first day of operation. \u201c (From Wikipedia). They\u2019ve been in the business for over 50 years now and looking to grow under new owners Kohlberg Kravis Roberts. \n\nAs a proud Texan and frequent customer of Academy, I can say that Academy has a huge advantage in the Houston area. Their outdoor competition consists of Recreational Equipment Incorporated (Smaller and most expensive) , Bass Pro Shops (Bigger selection, but less locations) , and Gander Mountain (Closed 100 stores after bankruptcy) While on the Sporting Goods side they compete with Sports Authority (bankrupt) and Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods (only in malls). They have a good grip on the Houston area and are continuing expansion. \n\nI\u2019m not going to do a deep dive into financials but I\u2019ll focus on the three major points about the company. Debt, EPS Growth, and ROE. The company has been able to smash earnings throughout the Pandemic and their YoY growths have been incredible to say the least. However, to get this kind of growth, they had to take on debt to subsidize their growth. The shorts are betting that this is the downfall of the company but they aren\u2019t thinking about the long-term effects of taking on this debt. They\u2019re using it for considerable expansion in a time where everyone else is shutting down their stores to cut costs and Academy is taking it as their huge opportunity to expand. They have been able to successfully cut down on debt through the issuance of Senior Notes and Secondary Stock Offerings\njust recently so they are making all the right moves to make sure the debt isn\u2019t holding them back. The third and final point is their 24% ROE, I shouldn\u2019t have to explain what this means other than you should be excited about their incredible margins.\n\nIn the future, we may see their expansion slow slightly because real estate costs will rise inevitably as the country reopens but they were able to successfully take advantage of this opportunity thanks to the nifty work of Ken Hicks and the rest of the board. While new properties will rise in value I think they will still have good growth. The Reopening means more business though as people return to their brick and mortar locations and even more in-store pickup rather than people ordering items from Amazon or EBay. They believe that the hobbies that people picked up will continue to drive sales (I can attest, Frisbee Golf is basically a subscription service to new disks considering how bad I am) and of course the main thing people mention on here is their firearms. I can\u2019t see what\u2019s a better retail recipe right now than Guns, in Texas, during national unrest, while the government is giving people more money to buy guns and ammo. \n\nNot that I\u2019m a huge fan of national unrest, but Academy\u2019s widespread gun sales and healthy variety are great for sales. Some stores have 4 whole aisles filled up with all the .38, 12 gauge, and .44 ammo anyone could ever need while other stores feature only 3 aisles because they need more aisles for fishing equipment in the summer. While unrest maybe a problem on a national level, Academy stands to profit hugely being one of the largest firearms retailers in the American South. Also, since Spring is upon us they will see upticks in sales for camping and fishing equipment as well as general sports sales. \n\nThese factors are contributing to interest in the stock from both the shorts and retail investors alike. Today\u2019s bullish nod from Barron\u2019s with a $30 price target and rising momentum on this subreddit will make ASO a stock to watch in the upcoming weeks. I\u2019m not trying to recommend that you buy the stock, but I\u2019m giving you information to give you a different look at Academy as more than a simple short squeeze opportunity. Before buying the stock yourself, do more DD  to get a better feel for the company and consider the risks that investing contains. Best of luck to y\u2019all in your endeavor for big tendies.\n\nTLDR: Gun sales are rising and Academy is a major retailer. Have a huge advantage over competition in Texas and they have expanded throughout the pandemic. Excellent EPS growth, top-tier Return on Equity, and the debt situation is being remedied. Bullish nod from Barron\u2019s and momentum on WSB is setting up a huge breakout.", "id": "m0xfvs", "created_utc": 1615259709.0, "score": 198, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 81, "comments": [{"body": "You can\u2019t drink by a Texas river without your lawn chairs and swim shoes from Academy.
