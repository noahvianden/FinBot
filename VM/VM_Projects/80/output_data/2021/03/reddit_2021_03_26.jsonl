It\u2019s still at 45 now, and puts at the 30 strike are cheap right now. Be warned, I may be getting a bit greedy here after yesterday, but everyone wanted to know if I was jumping back in. \n\nThe plan is to hold through Tuesday. I kind of paper handed the last one so now I\u2019m holding strong on this. Check my DD yesterday for why this stock is overvalued af and the crash to 30 has most likely started.\n\nEdit 1: already up huge, for anyone wondering if they can still make money of this HELL YES.
