Inflation is people having more money and each dollar having less purchasing power as a result. It isn\u2019t intrinsically \u201cbad\u201dbecause it churns the economy in moderation. \n\nWhen it has bad effects on the ECONOMY can be when purchasing power of the dollar goes down, but certain classes of people don\u2019t see an increase in the money they hold.\n\nThink about a minimum wage staying flat at $10/hour for 5 years. For simplicity let\u2019s say consumers earn $10 in a month after tax. They have to buy their basic needs like shelter, transportation, and food. So they spend $4 on rent, $2 on transportation (like car insurance or gas for example), and $2 on food, and the remaining $2 they spend on savings/consumables. \n\nNow imagine 5 years later, their monthly income has only increased by $1, so they now have $11 in monthly earnings. During this time though, there was huge economic stimulus and money printing, and other people in the economy have pushed the prices of all these things the consumer was buying all for under $10 previously. Because of this increase in money supply, people have greater demand for these goods from the stimulus. During this time, rich people (essentially corporations and their owners have gotten more money) have flooded their money into real assets to increase their wealth. This has inflated stocks and real estate. Now real estate costs more and this pushes the cost of rent up for the little guys. So the big guys have increased their nominal wealth significantly, and as a result, they can continue to afford a more expensive cost of living. Their real estate investments have gone up, they can charge more rent, they have more income coming in to their stocks, etc.\n\nBack to the little guy consumer. His wage has gone up to $11 per month over this 5 year period. But over this time, the cost of living has increased MORE than his increase in his wages. Now the cost for rent is $7, the cost of transportation is $4 and the cost of food is $3. He now is unable to cover the basic cost of living and can\u2019t afford to save or spend on consumables. ($11 in earnings, $14 in basic cost of living)\n\nThis can be the negative result of inflation, if the increase in wealth/money supply only transfers to the big rich guys, then the lower class becomes more poor and can\u2019t afford the basic cost of living. The implications of the poor becoming poorer is the \u201cbad\u201d part of inflation, because the poor no longer are buying the goods of the rich.\n\nSo in a way it is a vicious cycle. More money in the economy can push the prices of assets and equities up, it can also push up the cost of living.\n\nTo your question, is inflation bad for stocks?\n\nYes and no.\n\nYes: if the lower class falls and has no money, the whole economy has less people purchasing goods/consumables, company profits decline.\n\nNo: if there is money injection, prices of stocks go up, prices that those companies charge on iPhones, on food, on streaming services underlying the stocks goes up, profits go up, etc.\n\nCommodities go up because of similar reasons, people/corporations have more money to spend on them. If the economy declines, there will also later on be less demand for those commodities.", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": ["inflation"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Usually price of goods tend to go up, which profits the company\u2019s margin. 20 years ago you could buy a cart full of groceries easily, but now you have to spend at least 100 to fill it half way.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.23036408424377441}], "tickers": ["inflation"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Inflation not so good for stocks, but really good for commodities", "score": 32, "replies": [{"body": "it is interesting - inflation is not necessarily bad for stocks with low or no debt, as long as inflation is caused by growth and not just money supply", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "In some cases, inflation can also help people that are in deep debt.\n\nI borrowed 30k for school, which at the time, was a lot of buying power.

First of all if you borrow at a fixed rate a rise in the rate of inflation should be benefit you provided your profits rise along with everything else. Ultimately how well a company will deal with inflation has more to do with the competitive environment: a monopoly will just raise the prices they charge to keep it's profit margins the same and they will be glad to have loaded on debt when debt was cheap, whereas a company in a hyper competitive sector might have to eat into it's margins in a game of chicken with it's competitors. Thus a company loaded with short term debt in a hyper competitive sector will face serious issues and the companies without debt might be able to cannibalize it's market share should it fail. So you are not completely wrong but  if I were making a general statement about inflation and stocks, it would be that stocks are an inflation hedge.\n\nAlso, something I find worth mentioning, since my youth was spent in a country that had inflation rates between 20-100% for decades is that the higher the inflation and the longer the inflationary period the easier it will be for companies to raise prices because after a while consumers will come to expect it and won't be put off by it.\n\nSecondly growth will only cause inflation (assuming you mean consumer price inflation, which is typically what is measured) if the beneficiaries of the growth are people who weren't already consuming all they could reasonably consume. So if the primary beneficiary of growth is the top few percent of earners (like it has been for the past few decades) then you can't expect consumer price inflation, except perhaps for high demand and luxury real estate, rather if monetary supply doesn't keep up with economic growth you will get deflation. I suppose regardless of how it's distributed growth will cause increases in costs of raw materials, but then this will undoubtedly be balanced out eventually by more players entering suddenly more profitable raw material extraction sectors. Except of course for things for which supply is very limited and production can not be increased.

{"title": "New to thetagang - old to investing, but new lessons learned", "selftext": "I've been investing for about 30 years, and have even used options now and then.  But I was mostly a buy and hold type of value investor so didn't look too much at the options market.\n\nIn the last 2 months, I got interested in thetagang techniques and tried it out with part of my IRA, mostly with cash-secured puts (CSP) to open up wheels. Here's some of my initial lessons learned:\n\n* **Manage your buying power**.  It can be misleading how much liquidity you have, because much of your large cash balance will be tied up in cash-secured puts.  Every week, look over your positions and free up buying power for positions that don't have much time value left in them.\n* **Stock selection matters** more than high implied volatility (IV) or even IV rank.  I naturally gravitated to solid companies that I already knew, and in general, those worked out well.  For the 2 cases I went with high IV stocks (SQ, TSLA) those didn't turn out so well - had to eat some losses to get out.\n* **Dump stocks you don't want after assignment.** If you're assigned a stock that you really wanted, no problem, start the wheel and sell out of the money (OTM) call options.  However, if you're assigned a stock that you didn't see owning long-term (maybe you got attracted to the juicy IV), sell an in-the-money (ITM) call option at (0.7) delta.  Would you have sold a -0.7 delta ITM put option to open a new cash-secured put on that stock if you didn't already own it?  That's the equivalent of owning the stock and selling a 0.3 delta OTM call. \n* **Timing matters for CSP entry.**  Have some type of technical system for entry into the cash secured put (CSP) leg of your wheel.  It could be as simple as selling CSP on a red day, or when it's over the exponential moving average, or whatever technical system you favor.  It becomes harder to profit on the wheel if the underlyer reaches the strike in the first 2 days.\n* **Avoid low-priced stocks**.  If the stock is less than $20, you'll have a hard time managing your position because the strikes will be in $1 increments on the monthlies.  This is a problem because not only do you have a harder time with targeting delta levels, the bid-ask spread on the option is wider because the market can't arbitrage the difference between the bids and asks up and down the options chain.\n* **Track your position and performance**.  Set up a worksheet so you can always see where your buying power usage, percent of max profit, P&L (realized and unrealized), underlyer relative to strike, and days to expiration at a minimum.  I'm running positions on about 15 stocks, and it would be impossible to stay organized if I didn't have this.  I use Excel on Onedrive which has the nice feature of integrated stock price feeds, and it's easy to learn.\n* **Be patient**.  I haven't optimized my theta generation relative to capital, so my raw theta per day is 0.13% of the portfolio value.  That may not seem like much, but multiplied by 250 trading days, that's 33% a year.  Now, I'll probably lose a decent chunk of that to managing losing positions (I've read 25-50% of that), but that would leave a theta gain of 16-25%, significantly more than my expectations of basic buy-and-hold.\n\nI screwed up a lot in my first 2 months but got lucky and ended up with a P&L that was positive by 2% over 2 months, with the first month not having much capital deployed because I was getting set up and having a few beginner screwups.\n\nI hope this helps other semi-newbies, and I'm always open feedback from those with more experience.", "id": "lzrnyw", "created_utc": 1615127133.0, "score": 254, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 86, "comments": [{"body": "I would say stocks under $20 dollars are my niche.

For me I have been doing quite well on the \"cheap thrills\" stocks.\nOn solo & fuv I own stock at a cost basis that is not a net CREDIT!  I own stock and was paid to aquire it, simply because when I started the stock price was really cheap and easy to make up by selling juicy premium.\n\nOn Fri I noticed a stock I had looked at previously, but passed on had dropped back down, so I took a look at the numbers.\nI bought 100 shares and was filled at $1.01\nSold the April 1.50 call for 18\u00a2\nSold the April 1.50 put for 63\u00a2\nThen sized the position for my account by doing it x times.\nOn the put I originally tried to sell the 1.00 put but want filled at the price I wanted.

But it won't take too long to cover that cost basis, and if it can get to near that 1.50 area then the possibility is too sell the 2.00 strike, increasing potential future gains.\n\nWorst case, the company goes belly up, so my max loss is $170(pet lot)\n\nI use to trade spreads on ndx, rut, spx that had much lower potential gains and much higher max loss potential for each position.  So this cheap thrill has a better risk profile and much less stress.\n\nSo don't just write off the low priced stocks as a group.

{"title": "UNFI Deep value play with high short interest", "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[$UNFI](https://preview.redd.it/tqz5310qeml61.png?width=329&format=png&auto=webp&s=e610ed336e2a89ef31293c8b9577d5c453990c0c)\n\nTL;DR UNFI has the potential to reach $100 EOY with a possibility of a squeeze.\n\n# Who is United Natural Foods?\n\nFounded in 1996, UNFI formed the first natural products distributorship with national range. Since founded, many other regional distributors have merged with UNFI. Thus, making UNFI the largest distributor of natural products. UNFI has been valued much much lower than it should be and is soon to be where it should be.\n\n# Where are we at now? -\n\nI will state below why I think we are where we are, but in short: Amazon cucked UNFI in 2017 and acquired Whole Foods, thus scaring all of their shareholders into thinking that Amazon would never go through UNFI again.\n\nBefore this entire scare, UNFI was trading at an average of 11x EV/EBITDA with a high of 15x.\n\nThey were trading at an ATH of $83.91\n\nNow, when we use the EV/EBITDA multiple with FY21 numbers, we get a current multiple of around 5.7x.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[FY21](https://preview.redd.it/fjveat1teml61.png?width=628&format=png&auto=webp&s=2332bd5c2e69daa3b2dec25fd729c4b287fedf89)\n\n# What numbers are we capable of reaching?\n\nWe can use EV/EBITDA to find what our potential SP could be for UNFI. Take note that the fiscal year 2021 multiple is at 5.7x and UNFI's current SP is $31.50. I will calculate up to UNFI's previous high of 15x EV/EBITDA.\n\nI will be going based off of DOMO Capital's format for these calculations because it makes the most sense to do it this way. They calculated the FY21 EV/EBITDA by going from the older previous multiple which is 7x, the average which is 11x, and the highest which is 15x.\n\n* When you calculate the low of 7x, the share price is $43\n* At the average of 11x, UNFI is trading at $94\n* Last, at their high of 15x, the SP would be $145\n\nDOMO Capital's Justin Dopierala sates: \"We are confident that UNFI should trade at $40 per share at a minimum, and we believe a price closer to $100 is realistic and achievable.\"\n\n[https://seekingalpha.com/article/4406288-united-natural-foods-primed-to-soar-to-whole-value](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4406288-united-natural-foods-primed-to-soar-to-whole-value)\n\n# The biggest concern and reasons why UNFI is trading where it is.\n\n* As stated above, ever since Amazon acquired Whole foods and UNFI acquired Supervalu, we started to see a fall down. I believe (along with DOMO Capital) that this was the original scare for their shareholders.\n* UNFI's debt levels are also quite high at $2.485B\n\n[https:\\/\\/s22.q4cdn.com\\/589001886\\/files\\/doc\\_financials\\/2020\\/ar\\/UNITED-NATURAL-FOODS-INC.\\_10K\\_2020\\_webready\\_V1.pdf](https://preview.redd.it/b5ym4xzxeml61.png?width=770&format=png&auto=webp&s=78b81cd9619bdf6d9e1b65e1a245efec1c7405b7)\n\n* Lastly, UNFI has been struggling to make good profit which is adding on to their suppressed growth.\n\n# Why these reasons are terrible.\n\nI had previously done DD on this before UNFI just recently announced the renewal of the contract with Whole Foods so these points don't matter as much now but they might in 2027 when the contract may need to be renewed again.\n\n1. Amazon would never leave UNFI for a long time because the expenses of building something of their own is too high. It is much more cost efficient to run their business through UNFI.\n2. Despite debt being a big issue for UNFI, they have the opportunity to change it around pretty quickly. UNFI has a lot of money in physical locations (Cubs and Shoppers). DOMO Capital and other's have stated that UNFI can sell off those assets to help pay off debt. They can sell up to $1B - $2B which will net them plenty of cash to speed up the debt payments. UNFI has also already sold off 15 Cub stores. ([https://www.startribune.com/unfi-sells-the-real-estate-of-15-cub-foods-locations/568737362/](https://www.startribune.com/unfi-sells-the-real-estate-of-15-cub-foods-locations/568737362/)) Not only can selling these stores help with debt payment but it will speed up the process of finding new and better ways to profit.\n\n[Bye bye Shoppers](https://preview.redd.it/fr8gzm66fml61.png?width=292&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad24c29f60d58df1b7636232220071620704e04b)\n\n3. I believe UNFI is on their way to changing up their ways of making money and will most definitely begin to bring in newer and better money by incorporating new ways to cash in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https:\\/\\/s22.q4cdn.com\\/589001886\\/files\\/doc\\_downloads\\/2021\\/1\\/UNFI-at-ICR-January-2021.pdf](https://preview.redd.it/l6zba9v8fml61.png?width=1197&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b1af9b171a216e542cd5355cb83e61bd3542a2c)\n\n4. Lastly, UNFI just landed a contract with Key Foods for $10B in revenue over 10 years.([https://ir.unfi.com/news/press-release-details/2020/UNFI-Selected-as-New-Grocery-Wholesaler-    by-Key-Food/default.aspx](https://ir.unfi.com/news/press-release-details/2020/UNFI-Selected-as-New-Grocery-Wholesaler-by-Key-Food/default.aspx))\n\n**Considering UNFI has just renewed the contract and the selling of their grocery business is still on the shelf, these two can completely change market sentiment entirely and has already started considering the 20% gain in SP just over this week.**\n\nUNFI also does it better than any of their competitors out their. They're the top dogs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https:\\/\\/s22.q4cdn.com\\/589001886\\/files\\/doc\\_downloads\\/2021\\/1\\/UNFI-at-ICR-January-2021.pdf](https://preview.redd.it/5zsvo82cfml61.png?width=1190&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b60fb6272e4593659fe29b86e77f3fc29a54b64)\n\n# Short Interest\n\n[Fintel](https://preview.redd.it/ildim1xdfml61.png?width=892&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9aac3c1a711b1eecaee1d4a95da8ebc446c15bd)\n\n* UNFI's current percentage of shares shorted is 22%/12M shares. I am not calling this the next GME by any means. However, SI is high and there is potential to squeeze to a certain extent.\n* CFRA has also noted: \"A prolonged short squeeze is the largest upside risk, in our opinion\"\n\n# Technical Analysis Wizardry\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[10Y Chart](https://preview.redd.it/9mb1z4nffml61.png?width=811&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c89b3abc45b62f8e3263362915e64292e1bec79)\n\n* To start, we can clearly see that a downtrend has been broken. UNFI had been flying down for 5 years and now, that downtrend has been broken right at the start of 2021.\n* To add to that, the 200d SMA has also been passed.\n* RSI is sitting at around 70 which technical is considered overbought/overvalued but we obviously know UNFI is far from overvalued. This shows us good buying pressure.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[MACD](https://preview.redd.it/s1jbcsdhfml61.png?width=544&format=png&auto=webp&s=c4337fb9fe260469c8a96b4403dca44fea689f81)\n\n* Lastly, MACD has a pretty bounce with a bullish cross.\n\n# Conclusion\n\n* UNFI has potential to reach upwards of $140 within the next few years with possible squeeze coming soon.\n* This can't go tits up\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I have added DOMO Capital's link and their comments on UNFI too. I should have done this in the first place. This is my first DD and I used their template to build mine since I wasn't sure where to begin. Link is there now though and I changed + added more!

{"title": "DD DG (Dollar General) - poor folks love it!", "selftext": "Obligatory not trying to distract from GME. I'm in at $310 so please pick me up on the way to the moon.\n\nLong time lurker - first time poster. I'm retarded and my portfolio is red over the past year so do not listen to me, this is not financial advice.\n\nDollar general stock is down ~20% over the last 6 months and barely up since the beginning of the pandemic.\n\nBut IMO there is no reason for it. They have beaten earnings and revenue projections the last 4 quarters. The narrative is that they only beat because of the pandemic retail boost and it is not sustainable. But we are going to be in the \"pandemic economy\" for a long long time. DG stock is going to double in the next 2 years and let me tell you why:\n\n- These fuckers own the retail market for lower income folks. My sister works at Walmart headquarters in Bentonville and there is literally a Dollar General right next to her house. They go head to head with Walmart and don't give a fuck.\n- Poor people fucking love Dollar General. They have brand recognition and brand loyalty. Go to bumfuck Missouri, sit outside a gas station, and ask everyone who walks in which is cooler - Walmart or DG - I guarantee 9 out of 10 will say DG.\n- They are beginning to experiment with their own brands. This will go well. Imagine you can buy a case of beer and the cans just say \"Beer\" on them. Who wouldn't fucking buy that?\n- This stimulus package is perfect for DG. We are literally handing poor folks thousands of dollars right now PLUS the increased child tax credit will be hugely beneficial to DG customers. Do you understand how many children these people have? And where do you think they are going to spend their stimulus checks? They aren't buying stocks or driving into the goddamn big city to shop at Target or Best Buy. They are taking those checks straight to DG and buying extra groceries, beauty products, alcohol, lawn chairs, electronics, and more. Yes, literally everything poor people need is sold at DG.\n- If inflation ever hits, everyone is going to be shopping at DG. It's not like the current customers have a cheaper alternative to turn to. If when inflation hits prices and not our paychecks, more and more of us will be pushed to shop at DG.\n- DG stock is being held down because every granny with a checkbook is buying tech stocks right now. But when that bubble finally bursts, people will remember that it's ok to own stock is companies that actually fucking make money. DG is bubble proof and will benefit from the bubble bursting twofold. People who lose in the bubble will be forced to buy DG stock as well as shop at DG for daily goods.\n- They are starting to dabble in tech and online shopping. I'm not saying they are going to pivot to machine learning. But they do have the data and consumer loyalty to suck more out of their market.\n- DG still sells tobacco and will own that market as larger corporations bow to pressure not to tell cigs. Maybe Biden legalizes weed and DG starts selling marijuana loosies?\nThey are nimbler and more flexible than Walmart, Target, etc. They are much, much better at meeting local tastes. You can buy locally sourced beef jerky at DG. They will figure out ways to insert themselves into more and more markets.\n- Analysts are nervous about their current weird CEO \"search\". Pretty soon they will either announce a hot new hire or announce that they are keeping their current CEO with some hot new initiatives. Stock goes up either way.\n\n\ntl;dr Poor people love Dollar General. Stock will double in the next 2 years.\n\nI own Jan 2023 calls at 240 and 250.

I'm not gonna lie, I don't know what a fair PT is, but I do know that current growth is not sustainable over the long term. \n\nCurrently, stores are making anywhere from 120%-150% of their expected sales, at least in my district, and from what I gather, the state at large. However, this IS because of the pandemic. Like you said, the majority of DG shoppers are poor and are largely rural. They dont want to wear a mask, and DG doesn't give a fuck if they don't, while Walmart and other retailers do (kinda). Once things reopen, these people are going back to Walmart where they can find more things they want/need.\n\nSure, in the short term DG is gonna crush Q4 and probably Q1 earnings, but in the long term I dont see it rivaling other retailers for a couple reasons :\n\n1) There is virtually no in-store pickup. The app offers it, sure, but  literally nobody uses it, and the app is absolute dogshit. Its much more convenient to use the in-store pickup of other retailers, and I think there is gonna be a move towards ordering in-app in the near future. \n\n2) Self-checkout. DG plans on installing self checkout in quite a few locations in the near future. Stealing, which is already a problem, is gonna go through the fucking roof when people dont have to interact with workers. Not to mention that in these rural areas, people like being serviced by actual people, which is why there was an exodus from Walmart to DG. \n\n3) Minimum wage increase. Sure, it didnt pass this year, but we have at least 2 years of a blue senate, and 4 years of a Biden+ Harris administration. It IS going to raise and that's going to tank the shit out of DGs bottom line, since they get off on cycling through crackheads that are more than happy to take the 7.25/hr  to pay for their habits. \n\n4) Incompetent tech. We use registers from 1996. They're pieces of shit. CBLs can't be played on DGs own computers. Inventory is poorly managed, and costs DG hundreds of thousands in waste.  If DG wants to compete with Walmart and shopping becomes more and more automated, theyre going to have to shell out some serious cash on engineers, programmers, and the tech itself. \n\nThe only thing that is protecting DG from people leaving right now is an irrational brand loyalty and cheap, shitty products which other retailers have in spades.\n\nObviously, I'm not a financial advisor and I am not opening a position for DG, short or long.", "score": 62, "replies": [{"body": "I skimmed your post.
