{"title": "Why I'm suddenly Bearish on Facebook", "selftext": "Disclaimer: I currently own Facebook shares, this is not investment advice.\n\nI am considering dropping my Facebook shares and it may not be why you think. While I've read skepticsm about Facebook's ability to survive Apple's IDFA changes, growing privacy restrictions from governments, and legislation around paying for content. My concern is something most may not be informed of - Facebook's atrocious customer service for those paying for the service (business users). \n\nOver the past few months, in what appears to be a mounting problem, Facebook's internal systems have been automatically suspending advertising accounts of some of their biggest advertisers - Consultants and Agencies who manage accounts for big brands / clients and run their ads. \n\nThis has happened to large so called \"VIP\" accounts that spend tens of thousands of dollars a day with Facebook as well as small business accounts and mid-sized agencies. The outcry from that community is growing on Twitter the past few weeks with zero acknowledgement from Facebook on the issue. \n\nWhatever this glitch is, it has now impacted me as well, my Facebook Ads account was suspended 6 days ago and I appealed immediately via the form they provided. In an email response within 24 hours (great response time) Facebook told me there was no problem that my account was just active and fine - it was still suspended. \n\nA small poll of Facebook Advertisers on Twitter by Facebook expert Akvile DeFazio showed 69% had accounts that were recently suspended for no reason, one advertising consultant said it happenend 4 times in a month.   \nSource: https://twitter.com/AkvileDeFazio/status/1371586465449136129\n\nThe glitch appears to occur when an advertiser's ad is flagged as being unapproved for one reason or another and instead of disabling the ad, the system suspends the entire account. \n\nWhen it happens advertisers, agencies, and consultants are locked out of their accounts for anywhere between 1 week and a few months (so far). During this period of time all of the ads in the account apparently pause and the advertisers go explore other advertising platforms for paid social - i.e. Facebook's competitors. \n\nThis may not be enough to put a big dent in to Facebook right away, but it may be the beginning of an exodus of advertisers that will slowly keep growing. This is not Facebook's first time having customer service issues with their business clients, they have other sporadic problems too that the company never appears to address.", "id": "m6lnp8", "created_utc": 1615934999.0, "score": 190, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 81, "comments": [{"body": "OMG!

Advertisers with greater ad spend are placed in higher support tiers. Having worked across the different tiers, I can tell you the difference in support between the lowest and highest tiers is colossal. Getting an ad approved/audited at the highest tier takes literally one phone call made to a senior FB tech's personal number; at the lowest, you have to go through a robocall and hopefully get connected to a person who can submit a support ticket to be resolved in a 2 month window.\n2. Related to the above, most agencies are moving towards a programmatic ad spend model and are utilizing third party media buyers to place ads. Essentially these agencies create ads and then use another company to place them in a bunch of different places, including FB. So you may have the top 150 agencies in America using the same 3 companies/service providers to place a colossal amount of ads - again, these companies are categorized in the highest tier of support.\n3. Social media advertising works *really* well. Hands down, it offers the greatest ROI for the lowest barrier of entry. It is the starting point for most clients I've worked with and modern advertising is now fundamentally built around social media ad content. Additionally FB's typical ad audience is between the ages of 30-50, and these users are the ones most likely to spend money with less effort or deliberation.\n\nAt this point, I'd say the biggest threat to FB ad spend is going to be an exodus caused by ethical concerns. If major advertisers or programmatic providers make a stand and say they'll no longer place ads on FB, then FB will be in trouble - but until that happens, FB has a stable pool of advertisers and users looking to spend money. Small agencies can't afford to give up FB advertising (which is also the ad client for IG, Whatsapp and other placements) even if it is cumbersome, since it's basically the bread and butter for most agencies to sign on clients.

It's incredibly frustrating and directly impacts a marketers ability to do their job, but it's important to understand that small businesses and agencies constitute a near negligible source of revenue relative to the larger spenders.\n\nIt takes something like $50,000 worth of ongoing (monthly active) ad spend to be moved to a tier where you can even reliably speak to a human representative - it's the same thing for Google Ad spend, *which is better* but uses the same tiered \"partner\" system. $100,000 is when you get access to an account manager, but at this tier they're basically just junior sales representatives with some light technical training.\n\nIt's also important to understand that most agencies are moving towards a new method of ad placement that utilizes a middle-man in the form of programmatic ad placement. These programmatic advertising agencies are outsourced by full-service marketing agencies of all sizes and therefor place the largest volume of ads through FB - essentially they function as ad spend brokers with access to better rates and more sophisticated placement tools. To this end, most marketing agencies don't even use FB ads manager anymore for a majority of their clients - and these programmatic agencies have exclusive access to FB account managers who ensure proper functionality.\n\nAnd here's the real kicker: after my account was unlocked and I was appropriately still pissed, I immediately turned around and placed ads through FB because it is still one of the cheapest + most effective forms of digital advertisement and the need has only continued to grow in scope. Yes, there are other social media platforms to advertise on, but you'd be throwing your money away if you chose to advertise exclusively on Snap or Tik Tok over FB - instead, any advertiser worth their salt will tell you to focus primarily on FB/Google Ads and use any other placements as an omnichannel multi-screen approach.\n\nIf you wanna talk actual legitimate issues with FB that could impact revenue, I think you need to focus on the rapid horizontal growth of services that has created too broad of an experience for any one person to properly utilize. Additionally, changes to one service can have a domino effect that impacts all of them - which frequently breaks site-wide functionality and has a legitimate impact on ad performance across the board.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.41803085803985596}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3356122076511383}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6712474822998047}, {"body": "Facebook is fading in popularity, I dumped their stock when Zuck couldn't be straight with congress.

I am sharing mine below. Just apply it to some companies with good capitalization that won't go bankrupt and it's easy money. It is probably far from perfect but definitely better than listening to random news.\n\nMy strategy uses 2 indicators. Simple moving average from last 200 weeks (blue on the screen) and min/max price from last 200 weeks (yellow on the screen). All these indicators are used for really is to determine expensive and cheap prices.\n\nHow to use it?\n\n1. Split ur total investment money into 2-3 piles.\n2. Invest one pile per 3-5 months (this protects you from putting all money in before long bear market).\n3. Invest 1/2 of a pile when the price goes below W1 SMA(200) - blue line\n4. Invest the other 1/2 of a pile when the price goes below W1 MIN(200) - bottom yellow line\n5. No matter if you invested 1/2 or whole pile, sell 1/3 of investment when the price goes above W1 MAX(200) - top yellow line\n6. Hold the remaining 2/3 of positions until you are happy with profit (up to you).\n\nYou can see example entries here: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/uySEqjQE/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/uySEqjQE/)\n\nThis strategy is for investments lasting 3-5 years. Never sell a losing investment!\n\nThis is a very good money-making strategy, but you probably won't be able to execute it because:  \na) you won't be patient enough - sometimes the chance to enter with this strat may appear even only once a year on a given stock  \nb) you will be scared to buy when the time comes - when the price will be at the levels where you should buy, Reddit and other social media will be in panic mode - you must have balls to ignore them\n\nThis should be used on assets that are growing since forever (top stocks, whatever meets the condition really).\n\nIf you are using it you easily can ignore the news, Reddit, and other social media.

It is like the calm before the storm. Low volatility generally means the price is too high and others are thinking the same thing.

{"title": "My first DD post about BlackBerry...", "selftext": "Some of you might not know this, but I spent almost 30 years conducting reviews and interviews for the music magazine I run, and I thought I'd try my hand at a DD post about BlackBerry, since I don't see many here. Your critiques and judgements are HIGHLY sought after by me; did I do enough DD? Was there more things I could have talked about? Lemme know. Lengthy post so I hope it helps and you enjoy...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNOTE: I am NOT a professional investor and this is not meant to be professional investment advice. I always HIGHLY suggest you do your own DD and research yourself, and hopefully you will come to the same conclusion that I have. I like the stock... I hope you do too...\n\nCurrent analysis is that BlackBerry is starting to rise in value \"on the street.\" And NOT just WallStreetBets... Here's some of the more interesting reasons why I think BB is sorely undervalued...\n\nFirst let's take a look quickly at what BlackBerry IS NOT...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* They are not a cat! (sorry DFV)\n\n\\* They are NOT a \"phone company.\"\n\n\\* They are NOT, however, totally \"out of the phone business.\" As early as June 2018, BB had made some interesting BlackBerry Key 2 phones for the international markets, and the Evolve and Evolve X had been licensed for the market in India by Optiemus Infracom.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis last point is MOST interesting. Here's why...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThough BB had sold most of their phone patents to Huawei, their licensee Optiemus Infracom (founded in 1993, I might add) seems to be a VERY strong player in the Indian market. Though the phone systems have seemingly been abandoned, or sold, by BlackBerry, there's ONE bit of VERY important news that isn't getting through:\n\n\"As of 2019, BlackBerry Limited stated that only technical support will be offered for the Indonesian devices built by the company. Additionally, the operational status of Optiemus is unknown as of September 2020, as there have not been updates posted from them in regards to BlackBerry in India since 2018.\"\n\nThis last bit of information is MOST interesting! Did BB decide to intentionally hide this bit of info from the rest of the investing world? Did they think that their PR machine needed to NOT mention this fact to investors and shareholders? COULD BB at some point surprise the market with a new brand of phone?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOkay, so India... It's a country on the \"other side of the world,\" why should we care?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is the second-most populous country, the seventh-largest country by land area, and the most populous democracy in the world. Cool geographic facts, but HOW BIG IS THIS MARKET? With a fifth of the world's population, it's current population is 1,389,308,662 as of March 10, 2021... Not much to really explain at length here...\n\nThough BB DID \"officially\" declare as of September 28, 2016, it would cease designing its own phones in favor of licensing to partners. TCL Communication became the global licensee of the brand, under the name \"BlackBerry Mobile.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, what does this have to do with the \"validity\" of BB? This last bit of interesting info makes for a rather brow-raising piece of info:\n\nA few weeks prior to the expiration of TCL Corporation's global license expiration for the BlackBerry brand, it was announced that Texas start-up OnwardMobility has acquired a license to make 5G devices for the brand beginning in 2021. Unlike for the partnership with TCL, OnwardMobility will be making the devices for the enterprise market, with manufacturing partner FIH Mobile.\n\nLooks like BB is still involved in the overseas market. You can see just how far this company has reached!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEnough about the phones and speculation for the future of another BB phone, let's talk about the more recent events (besides WSB \"liking the stock\") for a minute...\n\nBlackBerry has been in the healthcare market for some time...\n\nIn December 2014, BlackBerry and NantHealth, a healthcare-focused data provider, launched a secure cancer genome browser, giving doctors the ability to access patients' genetic data on the BlackBerry Passport smartphone!\n\nSheesh, I didn't know that!\n\nHere's something interesting from the company's own website that caught my eye:\n\n\"38,000+ patents\n\n18 major development centers in 7 countries\n\nI wonder how many patents were sold off to Huawei.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNINETY...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou gotta be %$%&# kidding me?!?!? Out of 30 THOUSAND patents, only 90 were sold?!??\n\nI'll let you ponder that point for a minute...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, we all know about BB's involvement in other countries, but what about here at home?\n\nBut wait, what about those other 30 something thousand patents, what are those?\n\nWell, according to a Reuters article from January 12th of this year, those are:\n\n\"which include cybersecurity and building computer operating systems for cars.\"\n\nCARS... So BlackBerry COULD find itself on the cutting edge of EV and Self driving car technology!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, I would be amiss if I didn't address ALL sides of this statement, and this is the BIG one for me, though not a total failure. Read on...\n\nArticles from 2014 and 2016 point to Ford Motors using BlackBerry's QNX operating system in the new version of its Sync in-car communication and entertainment system, instead of Microsoft Corp.\u2019s (MSFT) Windows, which it uses currently. One might wonder WHY the Microsoft system was steadily being abandoned by Ford...\n\nHa ha! Windows jokes abound I'm sure in this one, but quite simply put, the shift is being induced by numerous reported malfunctions in Ford\u2019s current technology systems and touch screens.\n\nSo what happened this year? Ford decided to go with Android for it's future in car technologies. It's a Route One financial observer (affiliated with Cnet) noted, with automakers continuing to follow in Ford's footsteps, most notable with Volvo and it's cousin division Polestar.\n\nTwo things make this not TOTALLY bad news for BB, though this bit definitely affected BB price shares through most of the month of February (the news broke Feb 1st):\n\nOne, Ford didn't entirely detail what will make the partnership \"unique\" for drivers, but what will come to its cars in two years will be transformative.\n\nTwo, and most importantly, BB isn't TOTALLY out of the equation for Ford cars, since \"the Android software will also provide access to third-party developers who want a shot at creating apps specifically for the car. The automaker thinks it'll be what drivers increasingly want in the future: more customization and personalization in the car.\"\n\nSo in a nutshell, BB COULD, theoretically, come up with apps designed to run off of the Android software that's going to be in these cars. It's funny how vague and murky the press release from Ford was without giving specifics to exactly HOW transformative this will be...\n\nREAD BETWEEN THE LINES....\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFinally, a few other noteworthy items this year to pay attention to...\n\nAs of June 2020, \"its QNX software is now embedded in more than 175 million cars on the road today.\" That's a LOT of cars that will still be on the road for some time to come. In fact, if those are NEWER cars, those systems will probably still receive maintenance and updates/upgrades. (As opposed to, say, cars from 2000 - 2010.)\n\nWhat sorts of cars are these systems in? That same article references... \"Automakers and Tier 1s use BlackBerry\u00ae QNX\u00ae software in their advanced driver assistance, digital instrument clusters, connectivity modules, handsfree, and infotainment systems that appear in car brands, including Audi, BMW, Ford, GM, Honda, Hyundai, Jaguar Land Rover, KIA, Maserati, Mercedes-Benz, Porsche, Toyota, and Volkswagen.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShit, we haven't talked about cyber security or software!!! Cars, cars, cars! Yes, EV and self driving cars ARE THE FUTURE, even if it is still 2, 5 or 10 years down the road...\n\nOne thing I've noticed; once companies get government contracts, unless they royally screw it up, they're usually around for good, and stock prices seem to reflect that. With the newest Microsoft cyber security threat, you can be damn sure that Cyber security companies will get their \"day in the sun.\" This March 9th article is MOST compelling, and a reason why BB is setting itself up for the future...\n\n\"BlackBerry Limited today announced new technology advancements to BlackBerry AtHoc that will improve how U.S. Federal agencies communicate and collaborate during times of crisis, and reduce the risk of unauthorized access to Federal data, systems and applications.\"\n\nThis is freakin' HUGE... \"BlackBerry AtHoc is trusted by government, military, commercial and humanitarian organizations around the world including over 70% of U.S. Federal Government employees.\" This comes from BB's own website, and you gotta like the numbers... :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMarch brought a number of other announcements as well, which makes me think the prices of BB, though rising at this particular point in time, aren't rising high enough. From the March 8th article stating \"BlackBerry Limited announced that it has teamed up with Desay S.V. Automotive to launch a dual-screen virtual smart cabin domain controller to enable safer driving. Leveraging the QNX Hypervisor and the QNX Real-time Operating System (RTOS), the new technology is now available in leading Chinese automaker Chery\u2019s Tiggo 8 Plus and Jetour X90 models.\"\n\nto the March 15th article about introducing Next-Gen critical event management for the commercial sector, it appears readily obvious that BlackBerry isn't resting on it's laurels.\n\nAdd to that third quarter fiscal 2021 total Company non-GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, a high standard of measuring companies' financials here in the U.S.) revenue of $224 million, $757 million of cash, cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments at November 30, 2020, AND having 19th consecutive quarter of positive non-GAAP operating income, and you see a company that has effective money management.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, all that being said, BlackBerry currently has a Return On Equity of 21.22 percent, which is somewhat high in the index, but when compared to companies like Microsoft (42.7%), Google (19%) and Amazon (27.44%), sounds like it should be even MORE of a bargain. Let me say, though that I'm not 100% sold on using ROE as a sole indicator of a stock's value...\n\nAll in all I love the stock and believe in this company's future... Thanks for sitting with me through my first ever attempt at providing due diligence on a company... It was rather fun to dive into this company's history and outlook for the future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(Please note; all direct quotes from sources include \"\" so you know I'm not paraphrasing, but including actual research data given word for word from the original sources.  \n\n\nEDIT: I have 110 shares...", "id": "m5x5o5", "created_utc": 1615856491.0, "score": 429, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 83, "comments": [{"body": "Thank you \ud83d\ude4f BB has been lowering my net worth, but you sir have saved my reputation.

Halliburton - HAL - 47% move by July?", "selftext": "I've attached an image of WTI - Crude Oil and the Purple line is the correlation between WTI and the company HAL - Halliburton. \n\nAbout Halliburton - \n\nThey are the largest \"services\" company for the Oil and Gas industry.  They have their greedy little fingers in every aspect of Oil and Gas all over the world.  If the price of Oil is bullish then they are making bank.  \n\nWhat really caught my attention was the last 10 years when comparing the price of oil during inflationary periods and how it impacted HAL share price.  You'll notice that only after the financial crisis and during Covid, two times in which the world pretty much shut down, did HAL ever trade below (% wise) with WTI.   Obviously on this chart horizon of 10 years.  If you back out to 1996 then HAL is trading % wise over 100% lower than WTI.   \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith inflation pressures this will only cause WTI to continue to increase as well as if you are bullish that people will actually start traveling more.  Which is what traveling companies like Expedia are forecasting.  People have been locked up in their homes and their ready to get out and burn oil... \n\nPolitical Pressures - \n\nWith the Biden admin hurting US based oil companies by banning fracking and production on federal land this also has caused pressure on the price of oil.  Not as many drill sites can start up as before.  Also the Keystone pipeline XL project was shut down.  Not to mention if Biden decides to start another middle east conflict.  The treasury wants the interest rate on the 10 year to be around 2.5% which would also increase oil's price.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy dumb ape brain is saying that HAL is a major play for the Covid open trade.  However, I'm a stupid moron who is just guessing and this probably will fail... \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rlprgukkcfn61.png?width=727&format=png&auto=webp&s=856cd11dbfda997a01e329d8445126a3a5d246d9", "id": "m6ehn4", "created_utc": 1615915920.0, "score": 2, "upvote_ratio": 0.52, "num_comments": 79, "comments": [{"body": "I was right!

I like GME.** \ud83d\udc8e \ud83d\ude4c\n\n**Let me start by stating the obvious:**\n\nThis entire post reflects my personal opinion and is in no way financial advice. And for full transparency I also want you to know that I'm holding shares in GME and would financially benefit from any increase in price.\n\nElliot Wave Theory\n\n[ Elliot Waves for GME - What that means, further below... ](https://preview.redd.it/idm32ufg5hn61.png?width=1833&format=png&auto=webp&s=9998fee714a9de34c57496decc0b0084514bcfd6)\n\nI know most of you likely never heard the name *Ralph Nelson Elliott* and his surprisingly called \"*Elliot Wave Theory*\". If you want to change that, I recommend you read the free book [here](https://www.elliottwave.com/Free-Reports/Elliott-Wave-Principle). But since I know that most of you are too busy eating crayons I'm going to summarise it quickly.\n\nA rare recording of Ralph Nelson Elliot's early days.\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/m6mkl8/video/vsm22l8l5hn61/player\n\nAs you can see, our fellow \ud83e\udd8d Ralph already had a real hunger for tendies as a little kid. That hunger drove him to use his crayons on charts until he discovered in the 1930s that the stock market always moves in recognizable patterns back, so-called \"waves\". Simplified there are only two types of waves:\n\n1. Impulse\n2. Corrective\n\n**Impulsive Waves**\n\nThose are always waves that move the market and consist of five sub-waves because five is the smallest number of waves that can accomplish an overall movement.\n\n[ Impulsive Wave on GME Weekly Chart](https://preview.redd.it/1vuhwi4n5hn61.png?width=535&format=png&auto=webp&s=04cb758cc44e447e13e8362cce604c11bd12085d)\n\n**Corrective Waves**\n\nAlthough there are a few different corrective patterns we can say in general that they consist of three waves because that's the smallest number needed to achieve a retracement.\n\n[ Corrective Wave on GME Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/tz9lls9p5hn61.png?width=382&format=png&auto=webp&s=01894662f90ac0d8e184b0d53749adafc7944245)\n\n*There are a few special cases, and obviously overall more to learn about it, otherwise, there would hardly be an entire book about it.*\n\nBefore we now take our colorful crayons and applied that mind-blowing knowledge on GME there are a few other things you should understand:\n\n1. Each wave can and should contain waves in itself. \ud83e\udd2f I know... Sounds complicated, and often is, but to give you a simple example, in the 1-2-3-4-5 Impulsive wave above, you'd be able - possibly not on the monthly chart but on weekly or lower - to also fit another 1-2-3-4-5 between 2 and 4.This way you can confirm if your patterns are actually valid.\n2. Each 1-2-3-4-5 Impulsive wave is followed by a corrective wave. So, after 1-2-3-4-5, we see a corrective pattern like A-B-C. *(There are a few other corrective patterns but the basic A-B-C zig-zag is most common).*\n\n#  So you are telling me that fellow \ud83e\udd8d Ralph knew how to predict the market almost 100 years ago? Sure...\n\nElliot Waves are highly accurate and in my opinion a great tool to predict what the market or a specific stock is going to do.\n\nUnlike most indicators it doesn't lack behind, however, there are still cases where multiple patterns could be applied and only once a few more candles are on the chart will it be clear which of those actually is correct.\n\nAlready during our first \ud83d\ude80 launch attempt that got canceled by RobinHood and others, I used Elliot Waves to estimate how far that rocket might go.\n\n[Screenshot using Elliot Waves on the GME 15 min chart on the 25th of January](https://preview.redd.it/11kyqyv46hn61.png?width=1544&format=png&auto=webp&s=1dec899ebec3a26559848da7a73b3e0aff094162)\n\nI shared that screenshot initially [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4syrd/gme_megathread_part_2/gkqko9z/) and mentioned in a further reply once we reached that range that a drop in the range of $137-$207 will likely follow before our \ud83d\ude80 finally will launch to more than $4,000 per share.\n\n[What actually happened after that \\\\\"prediction\\\\\"?](https://preview.redd.it/ghttkcd76hn61.png?width=1552&format=png&auto=webp&s=1fd51527a0311b975640fe30d2aa07c4720a3b1b)\n\nAs you can see both statements were highly accurate and IMHO only because of buying restrictions did the drop go further than it should have and our \ud83d\ude80 take-off was canceled.\n\nIf you can follow so far that's great... if not, I really recommend that you use the time while we wait for take-off to read the book about Elliot Waves.\n\n# OK, but how come that $10,000 per share is now just a stop along the way?\n\nWell, by preventing the launch back then HFs fucked up IMHO and now more people are buying tickets for their trip into space. After all, Elliot Waves are in simple terms nothing else but the manifestation of human behavior on the market.\n\nHowever, the beyond average manipulation (preventing buy orders altogether) also makes it harder to say with absolute certainty that the following pattern is accurate, but since they anyway only reflect my opinion I'm still going to share them.\n\n[Using my new crayons on GME hourly chart.](https://preview.redd.it/aehej23b6hn61.png?width=1782&format=png&auto=webp&s=65e68b932cde18ea852691290e7e8300bacedb4a)\n\nThe way it looks right now we are currently in a corrective wave 2 (see 0-1) that is developing as an A-B-C pattern. Both of those aspects show a correction into the current range, although we haven't reached the predicted range for C in the A-B-C pattern (and maybe won't, but I wouldn't be surprised if the price falls into the range of $131-$161 to confirm both predictions and possibly also close the gap that's still open from the 5th to the 8th of March at $140.50).This would mean that we are likely at the end of wave #2 within a 1-2-3-4-5 Impulse.\n\n[\ud83d\ude80 Pre-Launch](https://preview.redd.it/jf5g20sc6hn61.png?width=1854&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd207b34169180baa9573f43a85b88ff66a3d019)\n\nNow, the projection for the following wave 3-4-5 looks like this and already gets us into the range of $10,231 to $13,382 - at which point we'd see a corrective pattern (A-B-C), which IMHO is very likely since a few \ud83d\udcc4 \ud83d\ude4c bitches would likely sell their shares at that price and HFs obv. will also try to create a drop at a price point like this to make it appear as if the MOASS is already over.\n\nHowever, as mentioned earlier, each wave consists of waves, so the 1-2-3-4-5 Impulse you can see in the image above is actually just wave #3 in the bigger 1-2-3-4-5 Impulse that began during the all-time low of GME. Confirming the highlighted pattern, and also confirming that we are likely going to see a correction/retracement/sell-off at that level. And that Corrective pattern would be wave #4 in the bigger Impulse, and after that, we will see our \ud83d\ude80 fly. It's hard to say how far right now, but personally I expect to see $130k per share, possibly more.\n\nNow, as said, all of that is just my opinion and not financial advice.\n\n**TL;DR IMHO GME will go short-term to around $2,000 at which point we'll see a small retracement and then we'll move to our pre-launch stage at $10,000 per share, followed by a drop to as little as $7,000 per share, followed by the \ud83d\ude80 take-off to $100,000 or more per share. I learned all of that from a very old ape called Ralph Nelson Elliot that used his crayons in interesting ways.**\n\n**EDIT #1:** I started learning the Elliot Wave Theory last year. Two predictions I published last year based on Elliot Waves were the [A-B-C correction in TWLO in October](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/TWLO/JJ2castF-Twilio/) (although my floor for C was a little too low) and wave [3-4-5 for TSLA and the $2,000+ price target in July](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/TSLA/iTTc7EjH-Tesla-Going-for-2-000/) (unfortunately, the stock split ruins the replay, but you can check the chart for yourself to see how accurate my predictions were)\n\n**EDIT #2:** Since some of you are asking if all of that even applies during a squeeze I looked for a chart of a recent short squeeze and if you take a look at [https://prnt.sc/10neu61](https://prnt.sc/10neu61) you'll see that the TSLA squeeze in 2019 also follows the 1-2-3-4-5 Impulse wave pattern.\n\n**EDIT #3:** In addition to \"EDIT #2\" to prove another point, take a look at [https://prnt.sc/10nezpr](https://prnt.sc/10nezpr) and you'll notice that wave #3 of the TSLA squeeze by itself is another 1-2-3-4-5 Impulse wave.\n\n**EDIT #4:** [https://prnt.sc/10nh43c](https://prnt.sc/10nh43c) shows the weekly GME chart with Elliot Waves from the low last year until now and also indicates that we are currently in wave #3 that will take us to $9,193 - $10,805 followed by wave #4 (short drop not visible in the screenshot) and our final take-off with wave #5 (also not in the screenshot).\n\n**EDIT #6 (#5 is at the top): Here are a few things I personally won't do:**\n\n1. **I won't try to trade those waves, but simply HOLD because I don't want to risk missing the take-off because those price levels aren't set in stone or guaranteed.**\n2. **I won't sell on the way up but wait for the top and sell on the way down. Because the price could go way higher than predicted and I rather sell at 80% of the top on the way down than selling at $100k per share** [just to see the top at $1,000,000 or higher](https://prnt.sc/10ni1ei).\n3. **I won't invest money that I can't afford to lose.**\n\n**EDIT #7:** Updated link in Edit #6 to include wave #5 prediction on GME weekly chart. Although, I want to point out that I rely on the hourly chart and use higher and/or lower timeframes only for confirmation.\n\n**EDIT #8:** WTF ARE YOU ON u/ChristianRauchenwald", "id": "m6mkl8", "created_utc": 1615937649.0, "score": 344, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 84, "comments": [{"body": "I have no idea what you are talking about.
