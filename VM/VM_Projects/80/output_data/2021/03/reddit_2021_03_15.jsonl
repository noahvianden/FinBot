So as far as I can tell, there is a \\~15M float, with \\~4M shares shorted. The GME short squeeze thesis has/had merit because there were more shares shorted than there are shares *existing,* let alone the float.\n\n2) The stock went up 30%. If it was an actual squeeze, instead of ppl looking for 'the next GME\", it would have gone up hundreds of percent. It was a pump, not a squeeze. \n\n3)Sorry to go back to GME but it is the one short squeeze we keep talking about. The stock was at \\~$10-5-ish for a few years. Lots of shorts got in in this time period because they expected GME to go ***bankrupt***, meaning they would have never had to return their shares (or even pay taxes). \n\nWhen the stock went to 40-60-100...etc, they stood to lose billions because the price multiplied in a very short (no pun intended) amount of time, and they were likely margin called. Tootsie Rolls has been in the 28-32 range in the last 6 months. If they shorted it at $28 (which they probably haven't, since it's not a business that is likely to go bankrupt any day now, as they thought with GME), they can still get out with about a 20-25% loss. It won't wreck them, and again, there is still about 75% of the float available to them. Sure, it will/would rise the price, but it won't be a squeeze(tm), that you are looking for. \n\n(plus GME had insane options activity, which again, I am not aware of for Tootsie)\n\nI am not here to rain on anyone's parade. You'll probably do a lot better, than people getting into GME at $150-200+, because again, this stock has been in the 28-36 range in the last year, and the risk of it really falling off a cliff is basically 0, and worst-case scenario, you park your money a few months and make a few % gains. :)", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "I am *not saying this is the next gme", "score": -3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3027667999267578}, {"body": "This dd is solid.

If this bill or a comparable bill doesn't pass during this session, then Tesla has to wait another two years for another chance.\n\nThis was likely a factor in the selection of Texas as a site for a gigafactory and the timing of that selection, to help promote a change from the old laws. For months, Texans have been watching a giant factory being built in their state, thinking about the jobs and tax revenue it will provide and the much bigger number of jobs and tax revenues provided indirectly by companies that work with Tesla and with Tesla customers. Now they consider that under the current laws, Texans who buy a Tesla will have to deal with out of state - meaning that for every Tesla bought in Texas, some of that money will leave the state, that could remain in Texas under the proposed bill.\n\nStrengthening the impact of this perception: many traditional Texans have a very proprietary view toward their state compared to the rest of the US (in fact, the state tourism slogan is [\"Texas: It's like a whole other country.\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Texas#Tourism)). Some people there may feel particularly strongly about money unnecessarily leaving their state, similar to the way that many Americans feel about money unnecessarily leaving their country. \n\nAnd as often pointed out, state laws preventing auto makers from directly selling their vehicles were intended to protect dealers from being undercut by the manufacturers who also sell to the dealers - but Tesla does not have dealerships in the US, so there aren't dealerships who need to be protected from Tesla by these old laws.\n\nHopefully the momentum behind this bill will be enough to overcome the resistance from the traditional auto dealers and the bill will pass.", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Oh\u2026 i thought they used this as leverage when picking the state for their factory.

{"title": "$PLTR Palantir Is BREAKING OUT To The Upside \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80", "selftext": "Hey retards! Palantir is recovering from it\u2019s downtrend, and starting to **breakout to the upside**. $PLTR has gone UP 19.42% from it\u2019s March 8th low, after benefitting from buying by Cathie Wood's Ark ETFs and other institutional players. If you take a look at the attached chart, it has broken through multi-month resistance and pierced the 20-day moving average. Why is it starting to run? Investors are realizing that it has a large and untapped Total Addressable Market (TAM) giving Palantir plenty of upside.\n\nPalantir operates two major data-mining platforms, Gotham (for government) and Foundry (for commercial businesses). It **STARTED OUT** for being known for its highly secretive work with the federal government. Helping these high-profile government agencies go digital with their big data was a major tailwind for the company\u2026 but this isn\u2019t why the stock price will **march to the upside**. The **NEXT MOVE** for the company is helping **commercial businesses** transition to the new artificial intelligence driven digital economy.\n\nIn the era of businesses going virtual, Palantir will play a key role in allowing commercial businesses to process their big data with artificial intelligence, much like it has helped the US government do the same thing. Helping businesses make the best use of their big data assets is largely an untapped market. The Total Addressable Market for the company is $119 billion. This means that at a market penetration of less than 1%, Palantir has **room to go much higher**. Adding to this, the big data market will be worth $229.4 billion by 2025.\n\nI'd pay attention to the following:\n\n1. Insider's lockup expiration date was February 19th - anyone who was going to sell **has** sold\n2. Chart is exhibiting a **breakout** from a multi-month downtrend and has penetrated the 20SMA\n3. Institutional buying includes Cathie\u2019s $ARKK. Goldman Sachs **price target is $35**\n4. In 4Q, Palantir signed 21 deals worth at least $5m per contract, including 12 deals each valued at $10m or more, many with **commercial customers** not government. The company is broadening its market to include commercial clients which represent about 10x their present Total Addressable Market. Revenue growth expected to be 4x in 5 years\n5. Many events coming up (DoubleClick Demo Day, Karp/Frost Interview) which will likely act as a catalyst for the stock.\n\nI\u2019m long Jun 26c options. **I LIKE THE STONK**\n\n[https://www.executivesclub.org/programs/upcoming/a-conversation-with-alex-karp](https://www.executivesclub.org/programs/upcoming/a-conversation-with-alex-karp)\n\n[https://www.palantir.com/palantir-foundry/impact/](https://www.palantir.com/palantir-foundry/impact/)\n\n[https://palantir.events/doubleclick](https://palantir.events/doubleclick)\n\n[https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/palantir-stock-price-goldman-sachs-q4-earnings-analysis-2021-2-1030092816?utm\\_source=markets&utm\\_medium=ingest](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/palantir-stock-price-goldman-sachs-q4-earnings-analysis-2021-2-1030092816?utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingest)\n\n[$PLTR BREAKING OUT!!](https://preview.redd.it/7vfqpkep37n61.png?width=1546&format=png&auto=webp&s=fcdda3cd7f76424a111911ce2c257ac9a598cc7a)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[PALENTIR x FERRARI CASE STUDY](https://reddit.com/link/m5ky3e/video/y2u3ylhx37n61/player)", "id": "m5ky3e", "created_utc": 1615815709.0, "score": 455, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 88, "comments": [{"body": "Finally some more people confirming my PLTR bias.
