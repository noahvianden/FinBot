Yes, he USE to be a broker, and Yes he's got some decent info about GME.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe also runs a memebr only Youtube site that makes you pay to make a comment on his page. He only reads super chats, and has NO insight or desire to look at any other stocks his members ask of him. He glances over anything that isn't GME, a complement about him, or just tries to sell him merch.\n\nHe's been asked about RKT, he didnt know about it. He was asked about CCIV..never heard of them. He was asked about AMC, and he bashes it, using his own opinion without any Technical Analysis to back it up. He doesnt do any DD, even when it comes to GME. He has nothing but guesses about where GME might go in the future. Can GME get into game streaming? Maybe. Wonder is he's heard about Steam, Stadia, Xbox Pass or PSN? Will GME get into eSports? Wonder if he knows about MTG?  \n\nThis guy is nothing but a one trick Pony. Once the GME bubble pops, he's gonna disappear, unless cruises start back up, which they wont for a while. And even then, he's always talking about how he sets up groups to go on cruises with him but only so he and his wife can get a free room. \n\nDoes he know his Poop about GME?  Yes he does. If you're in GME and only GME, watch him. \n\nLets be honest, if you're only in GME, then fuck me, why are you investing?\n\nYou're better suited to watch Treys Trades, AndrewMoMoney, StockMoe, Max Maher, Matt Kohrs..and really a handful of any other youtubers. Most of these guys are transparent about who they've invested in. \n\nNot only do  they all look at other stocks, they actually answer their viewers questions, and they educated you.\n\nBruce (not calling him uncle, cause uncles are suppose to be helpful, like Uncle Ryan) just reads super chats, and tries to sell his personal advice for $400 an hour. How can someone who no longer invests give advice? How can someone that hasn't heard about CCIV, RKT, HCMC, and whatever is at least being talked about all over the place advise people with their money?  Would you go to GME for advise about real estate?\n\nI'm sure I'll get some flack for bad mouthing Bruce, and I'm sure he'll have some sort of excuse or reasons for all this, and I'd say some of  this in his channel but I'm not joining his group and give him money to just glance over Super chats.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nApes Strong.", "id": "m7r8f7", "created_utc": 1616075440.0, "score": 73, "upvote_ratio": 0.61, "num_comments": 79, "comments": [{"body": "Did you just reccomend channels of people that literally just read reddit posts? \n\nFuck off", "score": 79, "replies": [{"body": "This is why I hate seeing AndrewMoMoneys stream and videos after his live stream.
