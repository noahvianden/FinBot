{"title": "Why the stock market is not crashing:", "selftext": "First off, let's go straight to the point. The last few weeks have been a bloodbath for most of the market. To many, especially new traders, this seems like a full blown market crash. Well, it's not... a market crash needs a catalyst. Think back to every single crash, whether it was the dot com bubble, the housing bubble in 08, and even the flash crash on black Monday in 87' they all had a catalyst, if not many catalysts.\n\nI keep reading over and over again in the media that the bond yeilds jumping is the reason for this market crash speculation. Let's think about this for a second though - besides the fed trying to hammer home the message to investors that the bond yeilds are absolutely no cause for concern, and actually it's not even close to reaching concerning territory yet, as well as the bond yeilds are actually signaling strength in the economy - how in the world do people come to conclusion that the market is about to crash because of this? Is there any real basis to this? Ask yourself this.\n\n Another narrative that i keep seeing the media push is \"the economy is overheating\". Seriously? What does that even mean? The economy is recovering so fast that the market is going to crash? This has to be the most insane thing I've read yet. I can also note that the same journalists who publish this FUD about overheating, are the same journalists who will also write that the market is crashing when there is BAD economic data (such as the job report this morning). So let's ask ourselves, how can both a booming recovery and a slow, painful recovery BOTH be ingredients for a crash? I cannot comprehend how ridiculous this is becoming. Good news = market crash, bad news = market crash. What do we need for the market not to crash? \n\nI can't talk about all of this without mentioning a wild phenomenon. My portfolio. A very well diversified array of etfs which hit almost all sectors of the market. The best thing to happen to it? A global pandemic/ lockdown. The worst thing? Economic strength indicators, covid cases plummeting and vaccines and stimulus getting pumped into the masses. Has the world gone mad?\n\nAnother theory that is floating around is the market being in a bubble. This is probably the most spread rumor. This one is pretty simple to shut down I think. Earnings season was insane. Comoanjes blew estimates out of the water left and right. Banks, big tech, e commerce, etc. These are the sectors that are being targeted heavily by fud in the media. These are also the companies doing the best they ever have. So how is this a bubble? Of course, companies like tesla and gamestop (lol) can be viewed and argued as in a bubble. But these companies are few and far between.\n\nMy conclusion is only this. Plain and simple, fear. Fear is what's bringing this bloodbath upon us. Panic selling over irrational news articles. Just compare the VIX (fear gauge) chart with almost every single tech stock or major company's stock chart. It's literally an inverse. A mirror image.\n\nIf there is anything to take away from this is that I truly believe this is just mass hysteria and it the dust will settle. Stocks will rise again. Invest in what you believe in and avoid the FUD that's being pumped out for click bait by seemingly every news outlet.\n\nTl;dr: there is no crash. This is panic selling on a mass scale. Don't believe the media fud - the pandemic is ending and there is light at the end of this Corona virus tunnel. Buy the dip with money you can afford to potentially lose and all shall be good again on wallstreet.", "id": "lx5nrb", "created_utc": 1614809314.0, "score": 139, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 80, "comments": [{"body": "> I keep reading over and over again in the media that the bond yeilds jumping is the reason for this market crash speculation. Let's think about this for a second though - besides the fed trying to hammer home the message to investors that the bond yeilds are absolutely no cause for concern, and actually it's not even close to reaching concerning territory yet, as well as the bond yeilds are actually signaling strength in the economy - how in the world do people come to conclusion that the market is about to crash because of this? Is there any real basis to this? Ask yourself this.\n\nWhen cost to borrow is low (low yield on bonds, low interest rates) it really fuels growth, and thus growth companies.  Companies can borrow large amounts of money cheaply and grow quickly.  So their stock value rises.  This is what we've been seeing for much of the past decade and growth stocks have done spectacularly.\n\nBut the flipside is also true: when bond yields/interest rates rise it gets more expensive to borrow, and so growth will slow down.  Slower growth means that the high prices on these growth companies is not as warranted, and so people will sell and the prices will drop.  Bonds also become more attractive with higher yields and so some of the money in riskier equities may also flee to bonds.  This is all an extremely well-known and time-tested phenomenon.\n\n> Another narrative that i keep seeing the media push is \"the economy is overheating\". Seriously? What does that even mean? The economy is recovering so fast that the market is going to crash? This has to be the most insane thing I've read yet.\n\nThe stock market and the economy are NOT the same thing.\n\nLet me put it this way: imagine a little over a year ago someone was to tell you that the global economy would go into a shutdown for over a year, millions would lose their jobs, GDP would drop at a record pace...and the stock market would have one of its greatest upward runs ever.  You'd probably think THAT is insane, and yet here we are.\n\nAn overheated economy means that people are buying like crazy, and there could be a shortage of supply (including raw materials) to keep up,.  This will cause inflation, which can also cause interest rates to rise.  As noted previously, if interest rates rise then borrowing gets more expensive, growth slows down, expected future earnings go down, bonds look more attractive, and stock prices go down.\n\nIn the *longer* run a strong economy will lead to strong earnings, and that means the stock prices may rise again even if interest rates are at a higher level.  But in the shorter term the rise in interest rates will cause stock prices to drop.\n\n> Another theory that is floating around is the market being in a bubble. This is probably the most spread rumor. This one is pretty simple to shut down I think. Earnings season was insane\n\nEarnings are strong.  However, the prices have risen so rapidly that even great earnings have not kept up with the rising stock prices.  Now add in the spectre of higher interest rates to reduce future earnings and you have a situation where even strong current earnings are not enough to justify the current stock prices, and so investors will sell.\n\nNow, whether the downturn we are seeing in the past 2 weeks is the actual \"crash\" or not (I don't think it is), the market is really out-of-whack right now.  Especially tech and growth companies.  Either we will see a crash coming (and no, I don't know when) or else we are facing 5-10 years of low returns so that earnings can catch up with prices.\n\nSo there is all this downward pressure on prices.  So why might it *crash* as opposed to just correcting a bit?  Because stock prices have risen SO far and SO fast.  People have made big money and they suspect valuations like this cannot last, are going to be afraid to lose it, and will get out of their riskier stocks.

Renewables are on an exponential growth curve, and nuclear is basically flat.  \n\n53 new reactor starts isn't even enough to  keep the nuclear energy capacity stable long-term.   [In the US around half of reactor construction ended up getting cancelled at various stages -- for example the Westinghouse bankruptcy left a multi-billion dollar hole in the ground at the planned Virgil C Summer site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cancelled_nuclear_reactors_in_the_United_States).\n\n**Even if those 53 reactors were all completed (and many won't be), that's a drop in the bucket compared to how many reactors are hitting the end of life soon and need to be replaced ASAP.**  Most of the world's reactor construction happened in the 1970s and 1980s with a ~40 year planned lifespan.  None of the countries that participated are building enough reactors to replace the ones scheduled for shut down.  The USA has 94 power reactors with an average age of 39 years, and Watts Bar 2 is the ONLY reactor completed since 1996.  France has 56 -- also mostly at end of their planned lifespan and with no real plan to build replacements (the only recent build at Flamanville went ruinously overbudget).  Some of their old reactor units will get license extensions, which buys another decade or two, but many will not.  Canada has another 19 reactors hitting end of life soon -- and for example they couldn't get a competitive bid for adding new units to the Darlington site.  \n\nNuclear power is not economical anymore, due to the high up-front cost and long history of ruinous cost overruns and delays in construction.  Regardless of other factors, nuclear energy is a dying industry in North America and Europe, and modest growth in China and India won't offset that.
