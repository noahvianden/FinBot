I think it will be viewed as good but still not yet there, and probably won't have a major impact on the stock price because the overall market will fail to see what is obvious to us here on TIC.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "I think it's likely to be a big improvement, but it's quite hard to tell from videos online how good it really is, i.e. how far are we away from a true level 5 system.\n\nI guess there's two benefits to FSD improvements:\n\n1. Better FSD -> Higher FSD price/sales; and\n2. Better FSD -> Closer to actual Robotaxi revenue generation.\n\nI don't think the second one will be priced by the market until Tesla actually gives some real guidance on the rollout. The market might not even believe Tesla until they get 'approval' for a Robotaxi system without a driver. It's such a big technological achievement that the market might really be sceptical until it's actually revenue generating. If this happens, the stock price appreciation may come hard and fast similar to what happened in late 2019/2020 and after the covid crash in 2020.\n\nThe first one will dramatically improve the margins of the cars incrementally so that will have a direct impact on the stock price. For example if we assume 10% of cars have FSD and we double that to 20% because of a much better FSD product, that would equate to an additional $185M of net income for Q1. If Tesla delivers 1million units it would equal \\~ $1B of net income. Add on top of that a subscription service that might bring in around $2k per person per year, @ 20% take-rate thats another $400m per 1 million vehicles. Tesla is also likely to increase the price once FSD is in wide release, potentially further improving the profits generated from FSD sales.\n\nThere is also a big increase in deferred revenue recognition coming as soon as FSD is in wide release. This will be a large one time bump in the quarter, and also an improvement in profitability going forward. Currently Tesla's deferred revenue balance is \\~$1.6B, with the majority of that likely being FSD related. Tesla had a $162m increase in deferred revenue in Q1, which is likely to mostly be FSD related.\n\nIf we assume:\n\n* 20% purchase,\n* 20% subscription,\n* full revenue recognition for historical @ 80%\n* full revenue recognition for current/future sales @ 80%\n* 1M vehicles\n\nWe would have the following related net income impact:\n\n* \\+ $1B net income\n* \\+$400M net income\n* \\+$1.28B one time\n* \\+700m from new sales\n\nThats $3.38B just from the above impacts. This completely ignores any other improvements to Tesla's business, i.e. return of S/X, Model Y cost absorption in Shanghai, 3/Y ramp in Fremont, end of Elon's compensation costs (only 700M remaining).
