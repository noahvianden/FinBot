Large number of cloud providers won\u2019t be able to design their own devices and ARM will never be 100% of the server market unlike the smartphone market. AMD is also well diversified into console gaming and IP licensing areas. See for example Samsung\u2019s device using Vega. \n\nRegarding mining, I don\u2019t think this is significantly material to AMD from downside risk since a bulk of the GPU business is in actual graphics use. This includes high end PC gaming, console gaming and yes also perhaps mobile gaming if Samsung\u2019s plan comes to fruition. \n\nSo overall risks to AMD are just the usual competitive pressures but given that the overall markets they are playing in continue to increase in size, as long as they execute they should be fine. \n\nHaving worked in the chip industry for 25+ years there is not a whole lot of reasons not to buy into semiconductors. Semiconductor content in our lives continue to increase and while the players might change the overall industry is going to be growing and valuable over time. Just look at TI or STM or even INTC who have been around for 50 years and still going strong.\n\nJust don\u2019t bet more than you can afford to lose. AMD and others for that matter have struggled in the past on execution and so the stock might trade sideways or even down for a long time. \n\nBut Dr Su has built a solid team now and hopefully these issues are in the past and won\u2019t repeat again.", "score": 107, "replies": [{"body": "The good:\n\n1. AMD's growth numbers the last 2 years and forward guidance for this year are fantastic. 50% YoY revenue growth 2021. Margins are increasing.\n2. AMD's products are superior to Intel. every single benchmark has AMD ahead, save in laptops, where Intel only breaks ahead by increased power consumption (75w vs 95w), which at some level is a threat to laptop battery life. If the preliminary reports are correct. Where performance matters (everywhere except laptops), sales numbers look good. Laptops dont look BAD, it is just that in a supply shortage AMD is prioritizing the highest margin sales.\n3. As mentioned by others, the semiconductor market will continue to grow.\n4. AMD is gaining market share in the expanding market. AMD has a large runway, a great deal of room to expand. It is entirely feasible to see AMD double its market share in CPUs in the next 1-3 years.\n5. the PE of AMD is the lowest it has been in 3 years.\n\nThe risks\n\n1. AMD stock has held at present levels for 10 months now. AMD has traded sideways in growth for up to a year and a half before (2018), but its hard to believe that in face of such sound fundamentals AMD stock does not eventually respond.\n2. I agree with other posters that in the short term there might be more pain due to the inflation storyline.\n3.  Because of the strained semiconductor market, it is unclear to big investors at revenue levels just how big AMD's edge is over intel. Intel's revenues remain strong because demand is so high. That demand is forecasted to drop, which is one reason why investors are leery of the huge numbers posted this last quarter (stimmy bumps). If AMD has strong numbers relative to intel in the next 2 quarters (6 months) I have to imagine even the most cautious investor has to realize that AMD's edge is enough. Having bought computers for 15 years, I can say with relative confidence that AMD's performance benchmarks are sufficiently good that even previously loyal intel customers are now looking at AMD. I am one of those who has flipped. My opinion is not the market's, and revenues are more important than sentiment. I believe the revenues will come, but for the next 3-6 months maybe intel continues to hold up in the eyes of investors who are used to the story of intel being king.\n\nWhy I am optimistic in face of the risks\n\n1. I think the inflation story is overblown. I think inflation numbers are due in large part to supply shortages at all levels due to covid. Shipping costs and time are dramatically higher. raw materials are out of stock and are more expensive to purchase. Semiconductors are in short supply, and companies which would like to be producing in their factories (car manufacturers) are idling plants. People are buying more than there is inventory, not because of stimulus checks but because of global rampdowns last year taking effect. The price increases on basic things is passed down to the consumer, but eventually the market will equilibrate to the new demand.\n2. The Economy is growing. In the last month I have been struck by the sheer number of signs advertising that companies are hiring. This says to me that companies expect and are ramping up. I suppose it is true that after this pandemic many workers no longer think fast food and retail jobs are worth super low salaries, but that is not a terrible thing. The outcome will be more dollars in workers pockets, which is only inflation (to me) if: A, worker salaries are a primary cost in the bottom line of these companies, which I doubt, given McDonald's effortless ability to raise their minimum wage; or B, minimum wage workers start having so much extra cash that they stop bargain hunting, which seems unlikely to me. The minimum wage earners I know are delaying health care and car maintenance and other large expenditures because they are struggling to make ends meet. They are not purchasing toys for kids, they are certainly not buying clothes at 25% markups.\n3. Crypto will continue to be around in the short term, but even without it computers and gaming consoles are becoming more and more ubiquitous.\n4.

I am invested in AMD via bullish LEAP Puts. But I want to respond on some of the other technology or business related comments since that is my background. I have worked with both Intel and AMD as their partner as well as their competitor. They both have their strength and weakness. \n\nIntel biggest weakness currently is the fact that they own fabs that they need to keep busy. It is not easy for Intel to support third party usage of their fabs like for example competing with TSMC. Leading edge designs require lots of support from the fab to the chip designer in terms of libraries, models, tools etc. this is a multi year process and most designs of chips using leading edge processes are locked in around 4 years before MP. There is a lot that goes into decisions around wafer pricing, mask sets etc that makes it very difficult to move fabs once you are locked in. Some fabless design companies do try to accommodate multiple fabs but usually sacrifice either power, or die size or performance in order to do so. \n\nHence a leading edge CPU design like Zen4 won\u2019t move fabs once the design is kicked off. This is usually a 3 to 4 year cycle from architecture study to first mass production. \n\nIntel is just starting to move in the direction of offering third parties to use their fabs. So getting to a point of being competitive to TSMC is probably 2 to 3 years away best case. Which means they need to keep their own chips flooding their fabs in order to amortize the capex. This limits how much they can take risks to compete with AMD or NVDA or for that matter Apple. So is Intel a threat to AMD - for sure yes. But will they blow AMD away anytime soon - no chance in hell. \n\nAlso the rest of the industry - Google, AMZN, MSFT, Dell, HP, BABA, Baidu, Tencent, Sony etc definitely want AMD to keep going strong since they never liked to be single sourced to Intel. Intel had monopoly pricing for the longest time and they squeezed most of the ODMs very hard. \n\nAs I mentioned before - AMD has been in this position before with the Opteron. And they blew the lead and dropped the ball on execution and gave up everything back to Intel. This is one of the main reasons now you have seen designs like Graviton emerge. But the current AMD team is much stronger and different from the one that blew up before. And so history repeating itself is low probability. But if that happens I believe the biggest beneficiary will be ARM and not Intel. \n\nIs NV a threat - perhaps yes - but again only on the margins for now. x64 still has too much of a software development advantage to be unseated by ARM in the general compute space. And NV historically has had limited success in moving their ARM CPU designs to the high performance arena. If the ARM acquisition goes through they will be more competitive but there is a significant portion of the server space - both cloud and on-premise that will stay x64 at least for the next decade. \n\nNow regarding issues on materials, crypto etc - there seems to be a misunderstanding. Crypto will keep moving to ASIC more and more. And as the pressure for power consumption becomes more critical for crypto success, the GPU will become less important. At least the GPU that is non compute and that drives a display. GPUs that are used for compute like for ML will become more important and any slack or drop in demand from crypto for GPUs will be more than compensated by the increase in demand for ML in the cloud. \n\nAnd regarding raw materials - the semiconductor supply chain is very complex. Most of the materials come from Japan, Korea, Taiwan and very little actually comes from China and the US. Especially in the leading edge nodes. Fabs are just one small portion of the equation. Things like substrates are critical and this was shown by the Fukushima disaster which bought the semiconductor industry to a standstill. So fears of moving materials back from China to US and hence giving Intel or others who have fabs an advantage is not true. Even Intel is dependent of companies like SPIL or AMAT or ASE or Nanya etc. Being fabless has become an advantage in the semiconductor space now compared to 20 years ago when Intel\u2019s fab tech was head and shoulders above the rest of the industry. Having flexibility in targeting process nodes have given companies like AVGO, MRVL and NV huge advantages and have hampered Intel in expanding their footprint. For example Intel tried and failed to gain much in the networking space or the 5G space and it is still TBD it they will succeed in GPU and ML compute. They have killed many products in this space over the past 5 years. \n\nFull disclosure - I am long AMD, NV, ASML, AMAT, STM, ON and was short Intel before but now neutral on them.", "score": 17, "replies": [{"body": "Not ASICS, but staking.

Semiconductor Supply/Demand\nI mean, there\u2019s always been a high demand for this. But AMD\u2019s stock shot up BEFORE we had a real issue in the supply sector. I remember back in August, we were talking a potential shortage of chips. Now a days, no one can get them. I drove past a dealership lot the other day and they had MAYBE 20% of cars in their lot. The demand won\u2019t decrease anytime soon, and there\u2019s only profit to be made in the sector. Their stock hasn\u2019t necessarily increased all that much since then.\n\n2. Console parts\nI remember when the rumor was initially announced; Sony was ordering 50% more parts for their consoles, Microsoft could follow soon. Their stock? No increase. This was around October, when they were sitting around the $80 mark the whole time. This was a huge deal, considering they sold that much more product in the long run (over 4 years or so), but the stock never really fluctuated and only decreased throughout the month leading up to the announcement.\n\n3. Killer earnings\nThey\u2019ve been destroying earnings quarter after quarter, but their stock price never really reflects this. If they continue to increase at the current rate, I feel the next couple of earnings could be crucial to their valuation.\n\n4. Market share from Intel\nI remember just this last month when they posted a large market share increase from Intel within a quarter; this is without their mew Epyc processor line being released soon. I was very impressed with these statistics and could see a large growth in the field in the coming years. Getting people to switch over (from Intel to AMD) is the hardest part; staying with a company is relatively easy and requires little effort. \n\n5. Ideology of \u201cCyclical\u201d Stocks\nWe see the rotation into cyclical stocks form growth stocks to keep with the pace of inflation. I believe we are nearing the age where cyclical stocks aren\u2019t only classic necessities (energy, materials, food, etc), but also technological necessities. In my eyes, semiconductors are the number one technological necessity as we continue to progress into a technological age. Therefore, these semiconductor companies aren\u2019t only a growth stock, but also becoming a cyclical one. The market may be pooling \u201ctech stocks\u201d together, keeping Apple, AMD, Microsoft, and a bunch of other NASDAQ companies, and therefore reduce positions in those companies upon their transition. However, we may come to a realization that semiconductors will function more as a cyclical stock in the near future, and see a rush of investors into the sector.
