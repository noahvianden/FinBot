{"title": "$NOK DeeDee: Get Your Diamond Hands Off Me You Damn Dirty Ape$", "selftext": "Hey MouthBreathers, listen up. If you sold Nokia during the run-up then you just hate money. NOK got caught up in the GME saga and now the stock has a stink on it thanks to the mainstream media and others who don\u2019t understand how a Short Squeeze works, and how GME went parabolic in one week. Let's keep in mind, there were some good and truthful DD posts on NOK in December/January, and some great fucking DD on Nok in the last couple months. I suspect it went from $4 to $9 just from the massive influx of new members checking out our old posts, trying to find an affordable seat on the Rocketship. No, Nokia doesn't have a ton of short interest. But I still really like the stock and I\u2019d like to tell you why, and a little bit about our future re: John Titor\n\n\\>Let's not forget about when this wasn't ALL about fucking the shorts, jeezus christ.. NOK is different from that bullshit, because it truly has deep fucking value. And believe me, this goes DEEP.. They don't manufacture or sell phones anymore. The only connection they have in making and selling phones is the Nokia brand name being licensed out to a Taiwanese manufacturing company called HDM Global. Almost all the company's revenue comes from Wireless Network Infrastructure and Internet Routing Equipment. Let's go back and track this evolution --> In 2010 this only generated 30% of its revenue (Networking Products, Cellular Base Stations, etc) -- In 2020 this made them 85% of their revenue!! Nokia transformed itself into Wireless Technology Company you fucking retards!! They did this through a series of Autistic Acquisitions \"AA\" -- In April of 2011 they acquired the Wireless Network Infrastructure Assets of Motorola Solutions (this basically gave Nokia all of Motorola's 2G 3G 4G assets) --> In August of 2013 Nokia acquired Nokia/Siemens Network joint venture and renamed the division \"Nokia Networks\" and that same year Nokia sold its entire mobile phone division to Microsoft --> The in early 2016, Nokia agreed to acquire Alcatel-Lucent for $15.6 Billion which gave then all of their Wireless Technology, Routers, Switches, and Optical Tech within Alcatel as well as Bell Labs (formerly an Alcatel-Lucent division) -- This final deal gave Nokia the massive scale they have now to compete with the industry giants like Ericsson and Huawei head to fucking head (yeah.. this is real you idiots) And we know that Huawei is literally banned in multiple countries around the world soo... So where am I going with this, and why will they emerge as one of most important companies the near future?? \\*\\*REEFSHARK - AI DRIVEN 5G WIRELESS NETWORKS - NETWORK SLICING - AND THE POWER OF THE FUTURE\\*\\* Take an extra retard pill for the rest of this DD post, you're gonna need it. They have been building themselves up to this moment. ReefShark is the key here, 5G Network is the door, and AI Driven 5G Network Slicing is the living room of the future. Nokia has this proprietary chip that will play a big role in how 5G will be available. It will ease the load of 5G Network rollout because it has a 50%-%60 reduction in energy use, which is an outstanding selling point to the industries looking to tap into 5G bandwidth. It is the most efficient chip of its kind, by far, with the added benefit of boosting antenna performance. This efficiency is necessary to the way different industries and companies will utilize the 5G Network. They will go through MVNO (MOBILE VIRTUAL NETWORK OPERATOR) to basically rent out their 5G bandwidth from a cloud. This is called \\*Network Slicing\\* for all u chimps out there. For example, Tesla will rent out their own slice of dedicated 5G Bandwidth. More than 1,000 companies use MVNO already and most apes have not even heard of it yet. Here is how Nokia fits into all of this techy garbage: NOK IS ALREADY THE BIGGEST PLAYER IN THIS MARKET SPACE (they made up $4.5 billion of the $66.9 billion of \"Telecom Software and Services\" in 2019) AND \\*REEFSHARK\\* MAKES THEM THE UNCHALLENGED LEADER IN THIS EVERGROWING MARKET WITH AI POWERED NETWORK CAPABILITIES<\n\n\\*\\*\\*BONUS LEVEL\\*\\*\\* Last year NASA selected Nokia's Bell Labs division to supply the 4G LTE communications network for the moon soon. No joke, the ACTUAL Moon, not emoji moon. Before the end of 2022, they will put a highly functioning 4G network on the lunar surface in preparation for the planned 2024 return mission to the Moon. Drop the crayons for a second and think about this... Ok now eat the red one (it's the same colors as your wife's butthole after her bf leaves your driveway in his big loud pickup truck) Your stupid little smooth brain is probably wondering what all this old 4G talk is about with all the 5G shit rolling out nationwide, changing the course of history... Answer--> the lunar surface is relatively flat so there won't be interference with the cheaper, more practical 4G network. We are talking about putting a mobile network into space you retards so stfu. The signal will travel further, it just makes more sense. They must start somewhere, though this will evolve into 5G up there eventually. \\*\\*NASA could've given this contract to anyone, but THEY CHOSE NOKIA because they believe in them!! They believe Nokia has the best performing Wireless Network Equipment.. So I like the fucking stock ok?!! --> Insert Rocket Emojis, Fire, Boom, Flags, all that shit right here <--\n\nThe time to buy in is now..", "id": "n8scfl", "created_utc": 1620609343.0, "score": 290, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 81, "comments": [{"body": "A lot of words but I\u2019m already up 220% on these calls so fuck it to the moon", "score": 55, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.13995961844921112}, {"body": "Is this the company that had that cool snake game from the year 2001?", "score": 57, "replies": [{"body": "Not only that, they made the 3310 which might just be the goat.", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "Some say it still has a fully charged battery", "score": 20, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.028064511716365814}, {"body": "fucking loved that phone.

What's my evidence?\n\nOk.\n\n1. MVIS short interest was at 20% when that shit blew up to $28. What's FINRA showing us?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u2fe1pwoa9y61.png?width=518&format=png&auto=webp&s=2dc490e3692c72883298520fbb09c4a15185e791\n\nA spicy, spicy 29%. Gee I wonder why it tanked instead of going to the 60-90 range?\n\n2. Extremely bullish options chain set up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vb7raozob9y61.png?width=1110&format=png&auto=webp&s=18a844fd1144afc666197914e870828b3c8357c4\n\nUnless all of these calls running from 15 to 20 are all WSB, the people that bought these aren't in the business of losing money. There's only 2 weeks until all of these expire, and going from 14 to 20 is no small feat.\n\n3. Elliot Wave mumbo jumbo lookin' good, apparently.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[lines on a graph](https://preview.redd.it/922a5j25c9y61.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=4fc9a084cbb32b0247b14f8c9a1694cfe8dbac2e)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[yup those are some lines right there.](https://preview.redd.it/hbt0rm17c9y61.png?width=1045&format=png&auto=webp&s=32e65e5b5c23328a5f8622bb34dc627f5796144b)\n\nThe Elliot wizards say the next run up will is looking to be soon, and could go to 18 this week and 28 before the 21st. Can I back this up? No fuckin' clue. The info is out there, and it confirms my bias, so I put it in here. The wizards say that the price may likely (or hopefully) hit 12, as whenever MVIS hits the triple bottom support line it likes to rip the fuck up like nobody's business.\n\n4. Other indicators show signs of a run up soon.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[On the 4 hour, Stoch RSI, RSI, and MACD are on their way up.](https://preview.redd.it/o25pc1l7f9y61.png?width=1446&format=png&auto=webp&s=5fda48bf05e1517d24e26318881527dadd19c353)\n\nAlso, Mr. Fibonacci says that the next resistance point upward from 14.27 is between 16.93 (38.2% retracement of the 4 and 13 week low) and 17.51 (38.2% retracement of the 52 week high).\n\n5. No earnings report. Apparently any sort of earnings report will tank a stock shorted or owned by citadel, regardless of how good or bad it is just to put us 'retailers' in our place(example- AAPL). But good news! I heard that several darkpools have been closed, so no more or less of the \"buy from the darkpool and sell on the open market to only impact the price negatively\" tactics. Is that what a short ladder attack is? IDK. Seems like Citadel can just nakedly short whatever the hell they want without repercussions anyway, so take with grain of salt.\n\nAnyway, I don't pretend to fully understand all this shit, so it probably has more holes and a weaker foundation than a jenga tower ready to fall. Disclaimer- I have 40 19c's expiring on the 21st, so I need the hopium more than all of you.\n\nEdit: Forgot to mention institutional ownership is at an all-time high, with Mitsubishi Asset management Co. tripling down on their position.

{"title": "Gevo future great company can fly ahead", "selftext": "$GEVO Gevo Inc (NASDAQ: GEVO) has been an interesting stock to watch as of late. After a massive pop earlier this year, the stock has been tapering off its gains. However, if you\u2019re thinking about betting against the company, you\u2019re missing out on a huge opportunity. \n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know:\n\nWhat Is Gevo?\nGevo is a clean energy company, but not the traditional clean energy company that you think about when you think about the space. The company has no interest in producing solar panels wind turbines. There\u2019s no interest in generating electricity either. \nInstead, the company is focused on replacing fossil fuels with renewable fuels. \nTo do so, Gevo has spent years developing and perfecting a process to turn renewable feedstocks like waste wood and other things we would consider to be garbage, into isobutanol. This isobutanol is then used to develop aviation and offroad fuels. \n\nIn fact, Gevo fuels are already being used in commercial aircraft. \n\nHowever, with a recent announcement from the company, we learned that it\u2019s not only looking at the transportation sector as an opportunity, it\u2019s looking into natural gas for the heating of homes and other uses. \nPresident Joe Biden and his cohorts in Washington D.C. have long been proponents of clean energy, and considering their control over the nation\u2019s capital, big changes are likely coming down the line in the United States energy and transportation sectors. \nAt the moment, investors are focusing on those creating solar panels or setting up wind energy farms. On the transportation side, it\u2019s all about electric vehicles, but that won\u2019t be the end all be all.  There will be significant demand for clean, renewable fuels.\nFor example, I live in a rural area where an electric vehicle simply doesn\u2019t make sense. In my area, if I had an electric vehicle, the only place I would be able to charge it is at home. If I wanted to take a long distance trip, I would have absolutely no place to charge my vehicle when the batteries started to die, and would be forced to tow my vehicle home. \nThat\u2019s not the only issue with EVs either. \nUltimately, filling a line of batteries takes quite a bit more time than filling a gas tank. Who wants to wait hours to be able to drive their vehicle? Sure, EVs are fun, and popular at that, but they aren\u2019t practical for everyone. As a result, renewable fuels will become increasingly important, and in the renewable, clean-burning fuels game, there\u2019s no other company that has even gotten close to the accomplishments of Gevo. \nIn fact, Gevo recently announced a renewable natural gas project, and that it has issued bonds to fund the project. With the renewable natural gas product, the company will be extracting natural gas from cow manure, resulting in yet another renewable product. \n\nThe Market Has Gone Short\n\nAfter sending the stock screaming for the top earlier this year, the stock market seems to have gone short on the stock. In fact, at the moment, the stock trades with short interest of more than 20%. \n\nSo, why have investors gone short?\n\nWell, there\u2019s a bit to it. Gevo is in a growth stage, which is a painful reality for many. The company has signed agreements surrounding the sale of billions of dollars worth of its sustainable aviation fuel. However, to meet the demand set forth by those agreements, the company is having to spend massive amounts of money to build out its infrastructure. \n\nThe big spending at the company is ultimately leading to losses, which is scaring investors; but that\u2019s not always a bad thing. \nTake a look at the early days of Amazon.com. Everyone said Jeff Bezos was a lunatic on a spending spree as he built out his infrastructure to become the leading force in the e-commerce space. When Bezos\u2019 goals came to fruition, there were plenty of people with feet in their mouths. \n\nThat\u2019s likely to be the case for Gevo. \n\nYes, the company is spending money by the wheel barrel full, but that spending is a necessary evil, and will set the stage for tremendous growth ahead. \nAs the members of the Wall Street Bets Reddit have proven, retail investors are getting tired of hedge funds playing with the market at their expense, and are starting to fight back. Well, I\u2019m expecting a war to be waged in the relatively near term surrounding GEVO that could send the stock for gains in multiples.", "id": "n9cdus", "created_utc": 1620671501.0, "score": 155, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 88, "comments": [{"body": "This company have a huge future potential, Its a climate savior.

The green diesel can also be made from fusel oils, a mixture of several alcohols produced as a by-product of fermentation.\n\nRenewable diesel is expected to compete head-to-head on price with natural and petroleum-based equivalents, while reducing particulates and CO2 emissions, according to Gevo\u2019s CEO Patrick R Gruber.\n\nLow-carbon fuels reduce the carbon intensity, or the level of greenhouse gas emissions, compared to standard fossil-based fuels across their lifecycle.\n\nDemand has increased since California\u2019s Low Carbon Fuel Standard came into effect, which is designed to decrease the carbon intensity of California\u2019s transportation fuel pool and provide an increasing range of low-carbon and renewable alternatives, which reduce petroleum dependency and achieve air quality benefits.\n\nIn addition to serving the low-carbon fuel markets, Gevo\u2019s technology can also serve markets for the production of chemical intermediate products for solvents, plastics, and building block chemicals.\n\nThe group's stated strategy is to commercialize bio-based alternatives to petroleum-based products to allow for the optimization of fermentation facilities\u2019 assets, with the ultimate goal of maximizing cash flows from the operation of those assets.\n\nHow it is doing:\n\nGevo kicked off 2021 by announcing to shareholders and other potential investors that it has about $535 million in cash and no significant debt.\n\nThe money will help the company launch its Net Zero Projects to produce energy-dense liquid hydrocarbons using renewable energy and Gevo\u2019s proprietary technology. Gevo is currently developing its Net-Zero 1 Project at Lake Preston, South Dakota and other Net-Zero projects are planned. \n\nThe company expects the Net-Zero 1 project will have the capability to produce around 45MGPY of liquid hydrocarbons (jet fuel and renewable gasoline) that when burned, should have a \u201cnet-zero\u201d greenhouse gas footprint. In addition, the Net-Zero 1 plant is expected to produce at least 350,000,000 lbs per year of high-protein animal feed. \n\nGevo, which is working with Citigroup, said preliminary capital estimates for Net-Zero 1 are $700 million-$800 million (including on-site renewable energy generation). The company is in the process of completing front-end engineering and project planning to determine capital costs for Net-Zero 1 with more precision.\n\nIn addition, the company plans to begin the construction of its first RNG (renewable natural gas) project in 2021. It will produce RNG by using anaerobic digesters to convert manure from dairy cows into RNG, with production expected to begin in 2022. Gevo plans to sell most of the gas to the RNG market in California and use some of the bio-gas generated from this project at its renewable hydrocarbons plant, for example, at Lake Preston. \n\nFor its first major deal of the new year, Gevo in February struck an expanded fuel sales agreement with Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS). Under the deal now valued at $100 million, SAS will increase its minimum purchase obligation for Gevo\u2019s sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by 5 million gallons annually.  Gevo expects to supply SAS with SAF starting in 2024, from its Net-Zero 2 Project for the use and distribution in low carbon fuel regions of the US. Gevo and SAS signed the original agreement in October 2019. \n\nIn addition to SAS, Gevo has closed several other fuel-supply contracts - with Delta Air Lines Inc as well as a deal to supply its SAF to the aviation industry in the Pacific Northwest, by way of its customer and global fuel supplier, Avfuel Corporation.\n\nGevo also won recently the largest contract in its history after entering into a binding agreement with Trafigura Trading LLC, one of the world\u2019s leading independent commodity trading companies. The contract increases the company revenue pipeline to more than $1.5 billion.\n\nUnder the 10-year deal, Gevo will deliver 48 million gallons/year (MPGY) of renewable hydrocarbons, the majority of which is expected to be low-carbon premium gasoline with a smaller portion of the volume for SAF, starting in 2023. Trafigura hopes to supply SAF to both US and international customers interested in low-carbon jet fuel.\n\nLooking outside the US, the company has been awarded part of The Queensland Waste to Biofutures (W2B) Fund to support the development of waste-to-biofutures projects in Australia's second-largest state.\n\nAnd Gevo recently increased its footprint in India via a technology-licensing deal with bio-based technologies and engineering firm Praj Industries Ltd to commercialize low carbon SAF and renewable premium gasoline in the South Asian nation and neighboring countries.
