The VIX closed lower on the week, down to 16.70 from 18.60.\n\n**This Week \u2013 SPY** options are pricing a **1%** move (in either direction) for the upcoming week. That corresponds to about **$418** as a *bearish consensus* and **$427** as a *bullish consensus*.\n\n**Expected Moves for This Week** via Options AI\n\n* SPY 1%\n* QQQ 1.6%\n* IWM 1.9%\n\nWith lower implied vol comes tighter expected moves. QQQ and IWM expected moves are also less than last week. \n\n### Expected Moves for Companies Reporting Earnings\n\nEarnings season continues with reports from Alibaba, Disney, Palantir and more.

Stocks tend to stay within their expected moves around 65-70% of the time, but often those surprise moves beyond expected can be big ones, obviously. But when long options, and not getting a move beyond the expected move you are faced with an overnight vol collapse. Conversely, when short options via credit spreads, you're essentially rooting for the stock to no move beyond the expected move. \n\nLet me if there were any other stocks that I missed in the comments.", "id": "n8m3mz", "created_utc": 1620590184.0, "score": 404, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 88, "comments": [{"body": "The year is 2150.

{"title": "Palantir (PLTR) Valuation Comparison with its High Growth SaaS Peers", "selftext": "I am a data engineer in finance. I am embarking on a new journey to provide data analysis and transparency to retail traders. Stock price, sentiment and news headline can be manipulated by the street, but data is your \"seeing stone\" . Here is my quick notes about Palantir:- I did some analysis (linear regression) on growth SaaS companies. At $20, PLTR is **neither cheap nor overpriced** among peers.\n\n\\- The recent week's drop was spread across the high growth SaaS sector. If you see the price drop of SaaS stocks or simply ARKK fund, it is highly correlated to the **sector rotation** on inflation concern.\n\n\\- I saw people joking about whenever PLTR signed a deal, its stock dropped. Correlation does not mean causation. PLTR is projected to grow its revenue by 30%+, which is 300M+/y, or on average 25M+/m. To keep this growth, you would naturally expect at least signing two new 10M+ contracts each month. So please **do not get over hyped** when PLTR get a multi-million dollar contract. Think about the overall impact.\n\n\\- Despite the recent price drop of PLTR, SI stays at historical low at 2.68% by s3 partners. Total inst. holdings at 30% but the number of holders increased significantly to \\~600. I heard that HFs still **wait for earning to confirm** the commercial growth due to recent sector/macro risk\n\n\\- Key stock catalyst is next Tuesday's PLTR earning after hour. Keep an close eye a few key metrics, including **profitability timeline**, **Q1 revenue growth** (especially on the commercial side) , **2021 revenue guidance**, **contribution margin** and **stock based compensation (SBC)**\n\n\\- My model shows PLTR at **$20 is the fair value** given 30% Rev CAGR & 12% discount rate for 4B'25 goal from mgmt. But VERY likely management sandbags the projection to beat & raise. There is certainly short term hype & risk. But I am **bullish** with a **2-5y horizon**\n\n\\- As of May 9, **130.8M worth of contracts signed** this year with U.S Gov for PLTR  \n\n\nPS: Please follow me on Twitter [https://twitter.com/MikeyJia](https://twitter.com/MikeyJia) if you find such analysis useful. I am just starting but will continue to publish interesting data point about companies like PLTR.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t1ii119b31y61.png?width=1028&format=png&auto=webp&s=4efb02112389a7f712a526675881952563438355\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/31e73kic31y61.png?width=1186&format=png&auto=webp&s=0144549ca58597920af68fdf2c5f88e63e6a5148\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3q6ecnx141y61.png?width=666&format=png&auto=webp&s=4625548357aaaca31e67dcc250190576b5b25e58", "id": "n877f3", "created_utc": 1620537173.0, "score": 157, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 88, "comments": [{"body": "I\u2019m in it for the long term.

Because a product can be sold hundreds of times with 1 engineer, and a consulting service is usually around 3:1.\n\nSO these government PLTR contracts - they are great and everything but until companies start buying a 'software product' from PLTR and not a 'multi year servicing contract' - they don't deserve the multiples they are receiving.\n\nNow with innovative products like PLTR - there is certainly a chance that AWS/ Microsoft buys them out to integrate their software as a product into their pipeline, but i don't think it is likely - especially with all of the government red tape in the way.", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "Hey heapsp, I am a developer too so I pretty much just agree with you.

The closest comparison for PLTR is just IBM but IBM is nearly not growing so there is no good comparison.  \n\n\nBut is PLTR changing? Well, I think it can be too early to conclude, but if you look at their health care and supply chain archetypes, they seem to be on the way to provide a platform for various industries rather than solutions.

In order to productize this - they would need the product to link directly to the data sets and automatically perform all of the linking to PLTR's proprietary model (or make it self service). I think they have a long way to go before this is truly a product.\n\nMy consulting company does roughly the same with competitive intelligence in the life science industry. Connecting and displaying competitive intelligence from a number of sources but it is HAND CRAFTED DATA and requires our engineers to be involved every step of the way.
