{"title": "Looking for reasons why I *should not* go hog wild buying tech right now", "selftext": "This is my reasoning below. Would like to hear some counterarguments before I begin to go on a shopping spree; I\u2019m sure many users here know way more about this than me and can provide some great food for thought. Thanks in advance. \n\nBasically, a lot of growth stocks have been pummeled mainly due to A) sector rotation into reopening plays and B) fears of inflation. The first has no tangible impact on a company\u2019s fundamentals. The inflation hysteria does makes sense, as a lot of growth stocks tend to reinvest excess cash flow and that makes them more vulnerable to interest rate movements. \n\nBut with many of these growth stocks currently being decimated by levels of 50% or more, you have to wonder how much of that is priced in, and should inflation normalize over the coming months, these stocks should see a pretty massive jump in positive sentiment. I\u2019m pretty confident that inflation fears are a nothingburger, making this an excellent entry point for someone like me who has withheld a lot of gunpowder on the sidelines waiting for an opportunity to invest during a tech correction. If inflation does turn out to be a more long-term issue then, again, the stocks are already down 40-50 percent. Don\u2019t see how much more they can reasonably fall. The reward seems to outweight the risk.", "id": "nbk41n", "created_utc": 1620921869.0, "score": 68, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 81, "comments": [{"body": "Zoom out a bit.
