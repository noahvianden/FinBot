Your math works out usually for reverse splits. \n\nProblem is you\u2019re playing with a volatility option. Volatility options calls are more expensive than puts (just check your option chain) because they are there to mitigate tail risk (the risk of market crashing or aliens). The problem is you\u2019re paying way OTM options where most of the value is coming from volatility or vega.\n\nWhat happens after the reverse split is that all of a sudden you are not holding as many contracts. When that happens, the volatility of your position goes down (since you\u2019re profiting 10x less from any market crashes). What happens usually at this point is that UVXY swan dives until it lands at a place right for its volatility.
