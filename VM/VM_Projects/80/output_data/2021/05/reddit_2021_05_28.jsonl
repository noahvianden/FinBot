To the moon!\n\nEdit#2 Well it's July and Nvax has ju ped to 230 twice since o posted that DD when nvax was at $150. Those July 200 options were 12 baggers. Holding shares untill 2023 When a clear picture of our profit comes into view. Holdddd on!\n\n -\ud83d\ude80Mexico/US P3 trials and Price outlook \ud83d\ude80-\nNvax has P3 data coming In June. (7-14 days probable, end of June worst case) for their Corona Vaccine, along with other catalysts in the next few months (approval most likely slated for July-August for US ,UK ,South Korea, and the list starts there ). . Profits at the end of 2022 are going to be the equivalent or close to Moderna.  Moderna is a 75 billion MC while we are a 11 billion MC (About 7x less of a MC  then moderna right now) So next year when our profit matches moderna's and our market cap matches we have about a 7x potential which will put share price between $850 to $1000. (Nvax is $150 right now so $150 x 7 is what the market expects)  Chart on Contracts nvax has and what future prices/MC is expected to be is down below in the \"DD literature section\" at the bottom\n\n\n\n-\ud83d\ude80 Intro to Protein and mRNA type Vaccines\ud83d\ude80 -\nProtein vaccines are the most efficient at handling Covid variant strains (more on that in paragraph below) so as time goes on, and variant strains mutate/ get worse ..... other vaccines will get more and more ineffective.  Other types of vaccines that can handle variants are Pfizer and moderna, but they still only take a portion of these Spike protein. ... versus nvax which makes the whole spike protein. Why did why does this matter? put it this way...\n\n             \n                           \n-\ud83d\ude80Differences how Protein vs.mRNA vaxs work\ud83d\ude80 -\nImagine if the whole spike protein is like a picture. Then I took that picture and I chopped it up into 100 pieces... what Moderna does it takes one piece of that picture and tells your body to recognize it to understand the whole picture, and helps modify your Messenger RNA to recognize the virus. What Nvax does, it uses more of a complete picture... almost all the pieces of the picture, so as the virus mutates  one piece of that picture it can still recognize the virus due to being able to see various other parts of the picture. In the mRNA method using one portion of the picture as virus mutates,  it becomes easy to distort and not recognize the picture anymore therefore needing to always update your vaccine ... that's what moderna and Pfzer have to do.  Because of this using the whole Spike protein via a protein vaccine is the most effective type of vaccine for covid. .... And due to this I expect protein vaccines will be the most in demand due to using a full length protein.\n\n\n\n-\ud83d\ude80 Safety, Side Effects, and Adjuvenants  \ud83d\ude80-\n Every vaccine uses what's called an adjuvenant. This basically boosts the vaccines effectiveness. There's different kinds, and every company uses one in their vaccine. Not all are created equal. What makes Nvaxs adjuvenant (called Matrix M) so special is its the only plant based (soapbark tree) adjuvenant out there, and is the least irritating. This adjuvenant has been tested on pregnant women in the past and pases with the flying colors. mRNA adjuvenant vaccines use common molecules found in viruses and bacteria that stimulate our immune system. This approach has not been fully tested on pregnant women long term. One of the most common types that were used in the past were aluminum salts. They were found not to be \"harmful\" but we also didn't know enough about them and how they affect us on a grander scale. A lot of anti-vaxxers are against aluminum salts and giving it to the children. This is why Nvax will be the perfect solution for anti-vaxxers, children and the eldery that want something completely safe. Just using the term plant-based in a vaccine adds a good connotation, let alone the stronger protection/immune responce it provides. As far as what the virus is grown in,  Nvax uses a moth based formula. So it's insect and plant-based. Sounds like the Karen's will love this! Ultra safe. \n\n\nAdjuvenants work by creating an irritation/inflammation at the injection site, This in turn helps the vaccines be more effective apon administration. This is what makes you feel sore after getting a vaccine and specifically amount of adjuvenate that being used.  NVAX only needs to use 5mM vs  mRNA type vaccines use anywhere from 50 to 100 mM of adjuvenant. Therefore when getting a mRNA type vaccines you get a much stronger side effect due to the large amount being used. This is proof how effective nvax is because they need to use so little to be to get a strong immune response. Hence why they have the best data and we're called a first in class vaccine. In conjunction with how much adjuvenant is being used you can also say it directly alters the safety profile. Use too much and you get too many bad reactions. This is why Nvax has one of the best safety profiles out there.Hands down \ud83d\ude4c Bottom of my post is a link with a lot of the data charted out that includes all the side effects of each vaccine charted.\n\n\n Lastly because the amount of ajuvenant used in mRNA type vaccines can only fit one maybe two strains max before throwing off the safety profile and risking not getting approval.  If they do use two strains they have to use less adjuvenant for both to combine them, meaning you're not going to get complete protection for each strain from the vaccine.  Nvax does not have this problem because of the such small amount they use, they could combine up to five different strains without an issue.... And right now with it being so clear that covid strains are going to keep mutating we need vaccines thay can cover multiple strains and give full protection on each one. Sometimes one strain can cover multiple strains but depending on where the strain mutates, a bad mutation will require addressing each strain individually and putting them together in one vaccine. Since you can't get four strains in one mRNA vaccine this puts us out at a clear advantage down the road when people need to do booster shots, and don't want to get multiple vaccines through the year.  So all in all it's clear Nvax adjuvenant separates itself from the pack and performs much better then other kinds on Safety, Effectiveness, Coverage of all strains and convenience of less shots in a given year.\n\n\n-\ud83d\ude80 Logistics and Storage.\ud83d\ude80 -\nNvax can be stored in a regular refrigerator, and can be left out to sit out in room temperature for a while while you're vaccinating people. A special ultra low temp freezer is needed for the current MRNA type vaccines. Middle income to low-income countries can't afford the special freezers. This is a majority of the world, not to mention the intricate ways you got to handle it so increases your distribution cost because you need special warehouses, dry ice etc. Also makes it easier logistically/cheaper for NVAX to store and ship using regular freezers.\n\n                 \n- \ud83d\ude80 Scientific conclusion \ud83d\ude80  -\nSo far nvax is the only protein type vaccine coming to the market (vs mRNA type like Pfizer or moderna..... or inactivated vaccine...like JnJ or Astrazeneca). As of now Nvax elicits the strongest immune response out of any vaccine with the highest efficacy. Another thing that's really important to know is every trial is not built the same. Every company creates different end points for their trials. Some are looking for severe disease, some are counting everything mild, medium and severe. Nvax counted every single possible infection whether it was mild medium or severe. Case in point j&j didn't have very good efficacy in South Africa so what they did was they only counted the most severe cases so they could say that their vaccine works. (Great you won't die but you'll get so sick you wish you did).\n When looking at mild cases their vaccine didn't work very well. This is why it's always hard to tell apples to apples when you look at efficacy numbers because every trial is different. So you have to look at the devil in the details. \n\n\nIt's getting harder and harder to get trials done because people just want to get the approved vaccines. This puts other competitors far behind us, giving nvax a economic moat of profit untill 2025 at least. Their pipeline is amazing! They teamed up with Oxford for malaria vaccine that's in the third phase right now. ( second phase results for malaria vax was at 77% efficacy which of P3 is the same it's good enough for approval). Their flu vaccine had the highest efficacy vs any commercial flu vaccine, and phase 3 is already complete and now they're moving on for approval. They will running a trial on their flu and covid combo vaccine, and once launched they could double the price of current covid vaccine due to being a 2 for 1. Moderna and Pfizer are also looking at a combo shot but they haven't even started trials yet. The problem is they can't even finish their trials because flu is non-existent right now so be very hard for them to get trials done for a long time. \n\n\n\n -\ud83d\ude80 Investment Thesis & Financials  \ud83d\ude80-\nNvax is pretty much de-risked at this point vs where they were a year ago. Yes you could buy other biotechs that can go up 20x, but they are a gamble. This is a pre-revenue biotech that's more starting to make revenue of a giant pharma. (Hell of a scale up, generally takes years for companies to get to this point if not decades.) They have all successful trials, successful manufacturing officially set up, 2 billion dollars on the balance sheet, $2 billion dollars invested from the US government for \"operation warp speed\" (a program created during the Trump era to speed up vaccine development). They are expected to ship 2 billion vaccines next year. So this is the moment in time where this investment moves from risk to a much safer investment; where you can set it and forget for a year and not worry about failure. CEO came out and said \" all manufacturing now is done and set in place, there are no more issues or glitches to worry about and a year from now we'll be looking back as this being a major success\"\n\n\nThey're the most undervalued covid play right with the lowest float to future earnings ratio and high short ratio that's about to get squeezed in the coming weeks. The before Memorial day weekend on one trading day before market close 4 million shares were bought 5 minutes before close.  Representing about 80% of the daily trading volume in 5 minutes on no specific news. Hedges are repositioning towards long and a lot have bought in this last month. Institutional investment is about 70% in the company. \n Fidelity & Rowe Price etc have all added... and now is a good time to squeeze the small float while the shorts have a high ratio. \n\n\nA link for future outlook chart on forward earnings broken down per contract is at the bottom of the post in DD literature section. It converts future contracts that are a done deal into future market cap/stock price. With all current contracts and current negotiations stock will hit $850 -1000. IMO $800 easily by end of next year. Now would be a good time to buy some July 200-250 strikes and flip in mid June for shares/or more options when P3 results come out.  In June, anticipation will also grow for approval which will increase the implied volatility by a lot ....securing you a decent profit on options. \n\n\n\n -\ud83d\ude80My Positions \ud83d\ude80 -\nAs far as my position I own some $200 July calls along with about 933 shares. I'm all in baby.  Been in since $4.06, I panicked and sold once during February a couple months during the mini bear market and got back in a bit too early so got a wash sale as well \ud83d\ude48 but I'm diamond hands all the way to $800 from here.  LFG  (Check out next link below this paragraph, it has My positions with the price chart mentioned above. My screen name on stocktwits is Johnnyknowsbest. Been on there and here since i started with nvaxz feel free and drop a follow if you want up to date info. But honestly the whole board is worth following there's so much good DD on there, we have a really strong tight knit group of longs that help each other with DD. \n\n\nAlso below this paragraph is a link for the last earnings call and the lastest investor presentation, and the last link is a interview with CNBC with the CEO, where he talks about the data is coming before the end of June, but he said he thinks it could be earlier.  So sounds like 2 weeks is on par or close to it. Also discusses brand new information on how they are launching a covid flu trial this year. \n\nI expect this to squeeze hard in June. Feel free and AMA, been researching NVAX for over a decade.\n\n\n\n -\ud83d\ude80DD supporting literature\ud83d\ude80 -\nI've included a couple messages down below explaining more in detail about what I talked about in case there's any questions.

That's what I originally mentioned in the first sentence of my DD. (Just to clarify) That's a lil over a month away. In about 1 to 2 weeks US/Mexico P3 results are coming out. There's a lot of other catalysts such as EU approval for 200 million vaccines coming. There's a steady stream of catalysts coming, institutions bought and brought up the ownership to 70% in last 3 weeks. A lot going on for this stock. \n\nApproval getting pushed back 6 weeks is not a big deal, as theres too much demand for the next 4 years for covid vaccines. A lot of people think this is a race but it's really a race to do it right so sometimes taking your time and setting up manufacturing the right way and doing trials the right way will get you past the competition. And to top it off all the approved vaccines right now couldn't even vaccinate the world due to short supplies and too much demand. A lot of people want to think about the US demand is done because the US got at least 50% of people with one shot. The fact is most of the profits are going to be overseas. And we will be the go-to for booster shots due to our superior multi-strain protection. The US makes a very small portion of the revenue. With only 5% of the world being vaccinated there isn't enough vaccines in the next year to cover the world we're going to need a lot more than just nvax. So they will be selling at max manufacturing capacity for the next 4 years. Either way they're still producing vaccines as we speak versus Pfizer and moderna that started producing after they got approval and it took them awhile to get stockpile a ready before they could give out vaccines. So regardless, time-wise it's going to be basically the same in that regard because their stockpiling before approval so when approval comes they can hit the ground running versus when their competitors got approved they  stumbled out the gate with manufacturing.\n\nAlso last tidbit they can be stored at regular temperatures unlike mRNA type vaccines. One of the reasons why 1.1 billion doses of Novavax will be delivered to mid to low income countries because they can't afford crazy freezers for Pfizer and Moderna.", "score": 8, "replies": [], "tickers": ["pfe"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.28606677055358887}, {"body": "What's are the reasons for all the volatility in the past 4 months? Why are you that sure that their vaccine ll get approved?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "As far as approval we have the best covid vaccine data in the world to date! Better then Pfizer, Moderna JnJ etc. Not only that we have the most comprehensive data they took the time to get the most diverse population which made the trials tougher to show a good result, and still we had the best result vs our competition. The competition just breezed through their trials and brought in a bunch of white people to make it easy. For example we did a phase 2 trial in Africa with Africans and HIV positive Africans, nobody else wanted to do that because they're afraid of bringing their results down. But this is how you build comprehensive data and that's how you get approvals all around the world. This is why it took them a little bit longer to get across the finish line, but for all the right reasons it took longer and will benefit shareholders exponentially more in the future due to that. Because of the diversity of the trials the data is gold, Biden is teaming up with South Korea to send 4 billion dollars worth of Nvax overseas to low-income countries as well. So if the president say that NVAX is coming out.... it's not a matter of if, but a matter of when. The vaccine is very much needed right now so there's a big push to get it out there as soon as possible but also launch with manufacturing ducks all in a row unlike Johnson & Johnson who had manufacturing hiccups; that's why we're taking our time to make sure everything's perfect and we don't disappoint our customers like AstraZeneca disappointed the European Union and now they're getting sued and not getting any more orders. \n There's been scientific peer reviewed papers published on our vaccine by top scientists saying we're first in class and all the analysts agree. Including B.Riley FBR 5 star analyst Mayank Mamtani. Link below on what he has to say\n\n[5 star analyst from B.Riely explains why nvax has the edge the over it's competition](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/novavax-covid-19-vaccine-edge-215910558.html)\n\n\nAs far as Viotility goes...it was connected to overall markets. We hit 330 last time we reported data, the same week GME took off. When the markets took a big dip late February and in March we followed just like gme so we went down with the market. Then the CEO was kind of quiet while they were getting manufacturing worked out and we got hit with a lot of shorts like GME or AMC. In the last couple weeks manufacturing has been all sorted out. The FDA has been in communication with us and basically all the \"t's and i's\" have been crossed and dotted. We are about to hand in our FDA submission for approval any week with the anticipation of July approval...or very close to it.\n\nWhenever a biotech is pre-revenue the share price is all over the place. We are finally entering the stage of revenue. Went from being in the negative in 2019 to having two billion dollars in our balance sheet from deposits on purchase orders. So now we have orders finalized, manufacturing finalized. And Governments.... not companies, but governments sending us millions and billions dollars worth of orders that are locked and loaded and some already negotiating for years ahead.\n\nDuring the last earnings call the CEO said it was just going to be another couple months until approval and everybody got their panties up in a bunch and thought approval was going to be within a couple weeks so there was a sell-off. But there's no reason for a giant sell-off when approval is coming weeks down the road, people just aren't patient these days. That being said we're supposed to start getting approvals from different countries in July. \n\nAll in all this is the moment in time where the volatility will start getting a little bit better and we should be over 250 without a problem as a support.
