{"title": "Expected moves this week, SPY, QQQ, Crypto. Earnings from Oracle, Fuelcell.", "selftext": "**The Broader Markets**\n\nLast Week \u2013 SPY was down about 1.7% last week, more than the 0.8% expected move options were pricing.\n\n**This Week \u2013 SPY** options are pricing a 1.5% move (in either direction) for the upcoming week. With the SPY around $445 that corresponds to about **$438** as a *bearish expected move* and **$452** as a *bullish expected move*.\n\n**Implied Volatility** \u2013 The VIX was higher on the week and ended Friday at about 21, up from 16.50 to start last week. It is now higher than its historical average. December VIX futures are about 23, higher than last week.\n\n**Expected Moves for This Week**\n\nThe major ETFs are all pricing larger moves for this week than they did last week:\n\n* SPY **1.5%**\n* QQQ **1.6%**\n* IWM **2.3%**\n* DIA **1.5%**\n\nThe 1.5% expected move in the SPY is higher than the historical average. An Iron Condor with short strikes set at the expected move (based on the close Friday), needs the ETF to finish between $438 and $452 to see Max Gain. Here\u2019s an example on the Options AI chart, showing the risk/reward, breakevens and probability of profit of a $1 wide condor at the Expected Move.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cg0ks2ez44n71.png?width=572&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ccbb06cee17f40f627c650fed02dde02607ed4b\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**In the News**\n\nExpected moves for the week in Bitcoin and Ethereum, based on crypto options:\n\n* BTC 6%\n* ETH 8%\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Expected Moves for Companies Reporting Earnings**\n\nIt\u2019s a light week for earnings report with Oracle the largest company of note reporting:\n\nMonday\n\n**Oracle** ORCL / [Expected Move: **5%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/ORCL) / Recent moves: -6%, -7%, +2%\n\nTuesday\n\n**Fuelcell**\u00a0FCEL / [Expected Move: **13%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/FCEL) / Recent moves: -11%, -10%, +3%\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEarnings won't be a major focus for the market until October so macro trends take precedence in September. Overall volatility was quite low to end the Summer and was awakened last week by the string of down days in the market. IV has spiked (a little) and is now pricing in market moves similar to the move we saw last week.
