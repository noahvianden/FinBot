It\u2019s really the price multiplied by the amount of shares which gets you the market capitalization (market cap). So Apple might be $140 and Tesla might be at $800, but that doesn\u2019t mean Tesla is larger than Apple, because Apple actually has a larger market cap. Mathematically, this just means Apple has more shares outstanding to make up for the difference in price: this could be for a number of reasons (stock splits, reverse splits, share offerings and buybacks, etc.). QQQ is a bit of a different story because it\u2019s tracking an index of 100 stocks but same general idea with the underlying\n\nSo market cap is the easy way to determine what the market currently thinks a stock is worth. But where does that come from? In the short term, it\u2019s just the equilibrium of supply and demand for people buying shares.

This is unknown obviously but people try to estimate \n\nThis is where stuff like price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) and price-to-sales ratio (P/S) come in. These ratios, among many other metrics, help you to determine if a stock is overvalued. Typically, technology stocks and growth stocks have higher P/E and P/S ratios because tech tends to grow at faster speeds than other companies and especially software is a much higher-margin business. For example, look at the growth and profit margins of a company like Google versus McDonald\u2019s. This means Google should trade at a higher multiple than McDonald\u2019s and other similar stable/value companies. There\u2019s even more to it than that obviously but that\u2019s the general idea of valuation and what makes a stock cheap vs expensive\n\nInvestment managers and others in finance are essentially trying to determine fair value for a company and maximize their risk-to-reward ratio. It might work for some net fees but not most.

I knew they wanted my money to make money. They also had all kinds of fees and charges. So I took the time and did my homework a bit and came up with what I thought was best. A broker account thru fidelity and add to it when I can afford too. Buy etfs and sit on them until I retire and hope it makes a few buck's. I took a piece of paper n pen and tallied up how many people on reddit liked vti vt. Vti had more tallies so I went with that as my core w vxus for int exposure. I'm at about 70/20 split w them. Reminder 10 % is stocks\n\nSo I opened up a robinhood account before all of the above \n\nBacking up the story here... I found reddit and started looking around and I kept seeing game stop AMC and clov. Well GameSpot was too high per share for me.  AMC I think will be extinction soon. Left me with the stock called clov. Clover health. Try to make this short. Everyone kept raving about how it was at like 8 buxks and gonna shoot to the moon and everyone was gonna get rich lol. So gullible me I took 1200 and bought I think about 100ish shares of it and 1 share of chewy. My wife wanted it. Then I learned all of the rave was because it was a clov page lol\n\nLong story short they stated then to transfer my account as robinhood sucks and the hf own it fo to fidelity or td America. Td America was a pain to setup so I opened up a fidelity account. I then took approx 10k and bought qqq vt and some vti. That week I was up like 400. I'm thinking woe this is easy and great. So I did more homework and asked qs. Guys said pick vt or vti. That's the above story on how I came about choosing them. So after 400 in one week I dumped about 23 24k more into vxus and vti then boom. Monday market tanked I was down like 600. That's when I was like ohh shit you can lose money lol. \n\nSo now that I have taken a step back I'm confident in my etf choices I just need tonrelax and let it ride. 16 yrs is a long term investment. It's gonna win and lose but should slowly over the yrs gain. I need to stop looking at the damn app 10x a day \ud83d\ude44 \n\nReason I didn't do a Roth ira is I was told pay now or pay later. Biggest con to me was I can't touch the coin until in 59.5. As we talked earlier I may want that coin at 55", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah unfortunately for most blue-collar folks that\u2019s how it is. It\u2019s big finance and it\u2019s confusing and most working families don\u2019t know if they can trust it. But that\u2019s mostly because they haven\u2019t seen the historical data (hundreds of years of it). And they tend to draw a false equivalency between options trading/gambling and dollar-cost-averaging into VT or VTI\n\nI think a lot of it comes from accessibility and family influence: back in the day it used to cost a bunch of money to trade and it was super hard to do so most didn\u2019t even bother. And if your parents don\u2019t know anything about stocks, they won\u2019t teach you. I was lucky in that I grew up in a very stock-friendly household with CNBC going 24/7. I was aware of the market in elementary school lol but I recognize this isn\u2019t how most people grew up\n\nAnyways, yeah there\u2019s usually no need for financial advisors. Odds are they\u2019ll get complicated, try to get fees out of you and whatever they tell you will probably underperform VT or VTI anyway. Great choice with Fidelity by the way, they\u2019re an excellent broker. And even if you lost money giving into the hype on CLOV, hopefully you can consider it a cheap \u201cintro to the stock market course\u201d because at least it got you more involved\n\nAlso, just want to mention that there\u2019s probably no need to own VTI and VT/VXUS. If you already own all 3, I wouldn\u2019t bother selling though. Basically VTI is total US stock market, VT is total all stock market and VXUS is total non-US stock market so VT is just a combination of VTI/VXUS. Currently it\u2019s about 62% VTI and 38% VXUS because of the size of the US market but it\u2019s up to you how much you want to weight international. I tend to go less as I have a bit of a preference toward US stocks so I like the weighting you currently have\n\nAnd yeah, I still check my brokerage app way too often but oh well. Just don\u2019t ever panic sell even if the market crashes and try not to act on emotion. I remember people selling when the market was down 7-10% per day during March 2020, thinking they\u2019d buy back later, meanwhile I bought the entire time and the market rallied extremely quickly. Some are still waiting on the sidelines hoping they\u2019ll get the correction they were hoping for. Just remember the two key phrases \u201cmore money has been lost trying to anticipate corrections than lost in the corrections themselves\u201d and \u201ctime in the market beats timing the market\u201d", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.73466557264328}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4443865120410919}], "tickers": ["tsla", "aapl"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["aapl"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6025140881538391}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4757034182548523}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.18883511424064636}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.18177258968353271}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.41751134395599365}, {"body": "You could double your money in an Series EE Savings Bond in 20 years, guaranteed.
