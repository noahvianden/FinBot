{"title": "Stop buying dumpster fires and buy ASO", "selftext": "I\u2019ve refrained from writing a post here on my position in ASO for a while because I don\u2019t want to peddle my shit  and turn this thing into a meme stock (or do i) but I feel like I\u2019d be doing a disservice to my fellow retards by not sharing a major value story here with y\u2019all. GME made me more money than I've ever had, so I hope this can do something like that for some of yall, truly. \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nQuick Pitch\n\nASO is at a P/E ratio of 6.6 -7, with revenue $6+ billion, increasing margins and more profitable than ever, amarket cap of only $3.5b and their debt load being dramatically reduced ahead of schedule. Heavily owned by institutions, KKR dramatically reducing their majority shareholder % to now only 20%. A share repurchase program for $500mil and a lot of insider buying and Ken Hicks who turned Footlocker around took their share price straight up\u2026. How and why are people you guys not buying this up? This 6% dip this morning is probably the best value you can get on the market. Its pretty much an anomaly in today\u2019s market climate. \n\nDKS (Dicks sporting goods) PE ratio is at a 11/12. If ASO was adjusted to just a PE of 9 they would be somewhere around $58.00 a share which is a 45% increase from where we are at today. 9 is extremely fair. As the best and most efficient retailor in the market they should be a 15 or $85 a share. \n\nASO, Academy Sports and Outdoors, is massively undervalued compared to its peers and it is the best player in the space. Why aren\u2019t retail investors piling into this for locked  gains has me confused? It\u2019s a real company with real customers that are loyal and lifers of Academy, many have been shopping there since they were kids and now it\u2019s where they shop for their kids.  My guess is investors see Covid days as good as it\u2019s going to get for Academy, but the reopening is proving to be even bigger and permanent than expected.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nIt\u2019s important to know where Academy stores are located and who they serve. Academy has 259 mostly in the Southeast. They are a low/mid cost sports and outdoors retailer. Think youth sports, gym clothes, and camping/fishing /hunting gear. Their stores are often the only specialty retailer in a suburban area and some more heavily populated areas where ASO and Dicks compete (and in those area ASO wins every time). Their customers tend to be more blue-collar simpler consumers who would rather touch and feel the products vs order online for convenience, even though online sales have picked up drastically recently. Not having a strong online presence is not something that should turn you away from this stock. Nobody buys fishing equipment, camping gear, your child\u2019s sports equipment online, these are things you want to touch and feel and try on and especially with this crowd of consumers.\n\nLike I said I think investors look at covid lockdowns as if it were ASO\u2019s best days, in fact I think this is why KKR ultimately decided to take them public after seeing 2 monster quarters back-to-back, they knew their valuation would be higher than it\u2019s ever been and thought better take advantage of this fluke. I believe retailers are valued at IPO on their previous 2 quarters. But they didn\u2019t expect to keep having monster record earnings afterwards so turns out they jumped the gun. Here\u2019s why it will continue at least for a couple more quarters. Q2 last year we were completely shut down, sure exercise equipment and bike sales were through the roof, but youth sports and other sections came to a screeching halt. Now you have a massive reopening trade that will last a couple quarters longer as kids get back to each of their respective sports (each season) after a year hiatus and adults get back to their hobbies. Kids grow fast and I\u2019m predicting this sector of the business will be on fire for a bit as parents have to replace outgrown equipment. This should bring more traffic to their stores than ever Academy is doing well and will continue to do well because they have a massive loyal following in the South with a product mix that\u2019s borderline recession proof and mostly resilient to online retailers. \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nComps\n\n21\u2019 Guidance compared to 19\u2019 Pre-Covid\n\n\\-  Q2 Net Income at $560,000,000 up from $120,000,000 in 2019\u2013 increase of 352%\n\n\\-  Net Sales at $6.5B up from $4.8B in 2019 \u2013 increase of 35% \n\n\\-  EPS - $5.45-$5.80 up from $1.60 \u2013 increase of 252%\n\n21\u2019 guidance compared to 20\u2019 numbers (keep in mind 20\u2019 was thought to be their record fluke sales year)\n\n\\-  Q2 Net Income at $560,000,000 up from $309,000,000 in 2020 \u2013 increase of 76%\n\n\\-  Net Sales at $6.5B up from 5.689B in 2020 \u2013 increase of 15%\n\n\\-  EPS - $5.45-$5.80 up from $3.79 in 2020 \u2013 increase of 48%\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nOther bullish indicators\n\n\\-  Gross margin increased 29.4% to $642.5 million, the highest quarterly gross profit in the Company's history. The gross margin rate improved by 500 basis points to 35.9%. This growth was primarily driven by stronger merchandise margins from a favorable product mix shift, higher average unit retails and less promotional activity.\n\n\\-  The company also took steps to enhance its balance sheet. As of the end of the second quarter, the Company\u2019s cash and cash equivalents totaled $553.8 million with no outstanding balance on its credit facility. Adjusted free cash flow was $169.5 million. Merchandise inventories were $1.1 billion, an increase of 24.0% compared to the prior year quarter and 3.2% compared to Q1 2021.\n\n\\-  Academy's largest shareholder (KKR) completed two transactions, reducing their ownership to approximately 20% of the Company as of the end of the quarter.\n\n\\-  As part of one of these events, Academy purchased and retired 3.2 million shares for approximately $100 million.\n\n\\-  In addition to the stock repurchase, the Company paid down $99 million of its outstanding term loan and refinanced the loan's interest rate from LIBOR + 5.0% to LIBOR + 3.75%. Based on these positive actions, S&P (B+ from B) and Moody's (Ba3 from B1) both upgraded the Company's debt rating.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nIm long 6,350 shares at $37.30 basis. \n\nI'll let others talk about the Short Interest attached to ASO and any potential squeezes. I think its a buy  with easy 50-100% upside regardless of any of that. That would all be bonus. But if this thing does move to $50-$55 quickly it could really trap some of the shorts and gap up pretty quickly. \n\nPlease take advantage of this and stop buying Discord pump and dumps.", "id": "pkyq64", "created_utc": 1631197159.0, "score": 106, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "num_comments": 82, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|13|**First Seen In WSB**|5 years ago\n**Total Comments**|110|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l87bzk/dont_buy_otm_calls/) \n**Account Age**|5 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.362136572599411}, {"body": "Long $ASO.
