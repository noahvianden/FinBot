{"title": "$BABA - 3 day rule for the market to see the \u201cprosperity tax\u201d for what it is: bullish af", "selftext": " You don\u2019t fuck with Papa Xi. Everyone knows this. You either kiss the ring or say goodbye to your ball sack. There is only one Alpha dog in China, doesn\u2019t matter how many billions your company generates.\n\nIt has always and will always be this way. It is a market fact and that\u2019s why Chinese stocks trade at a discount to other equities - and they should keep trading at a discount.\n\nHowever, when you do kiss the ring, all your problems are over. There won\u2019t be any SEC, FDA, NHTSA, UAW or any other bullshit government or public entity to hassle you. Or there won\u2019t be some bullshit new tax to be spent on absolutely nothing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd guess what? $BABA just kissed the ring. Xi needs economic growth to raise Chinese people from poverty and to keep fabricating new millionaires in order to keep his party going. So he needs to bring economic prosperity to the rural areas. The ghost cities development didn\u2019t work. The common prosperity is a whole different ball game! Suddenly there is over $100bn + pledged to create jobs and bring prosperity to the million of Chinese that still live in poorer regions.\n\nAnd guess where will these modafockers gonna spend their income? What companies are gonna gain from this new and bigger income? The Alibabas, Tencents and JDs modafoooocka! It\u2019s a beautiful way to kiss the ring, be back on Xi\u2019s speed dial, create brand awareness and invest in your future customers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n$BABA has $430 billion EV ; trades at a 19x TTM P/E ; or if cash flow is your thing, Alibaba trades at a 16.5x multiple EV / FCF (and 9x EV / op CF)\n\nRevenue is growing at 40% CAGR since 2018 with 40% growth YoY - And The cloud business is nothing but a toddler yet. $AMZN is trading at a 60 P/E with a much lower growth.\n\nAnd the market? E-commerce in Southeast Asia added 70million users during the pandemic\n\nEither two things are gonna happen imo: the market is gonna digest this over the weekend, realize there will never be a de-listing and FOMO hard start Monday or this will be obvious by next earnings.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm doubling down on the former \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xljuevgte4l71.png?width=1001&format=png&auto=webp&s=92a448833d223b4f30d0935c6f96350abc6c8afe", "id": "pglvuv", "created_utc": 1630601816.0, "score": 104, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 81, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|59|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|356|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o6h30g/tesla_dd_easy_and_simplified_bulletpoints/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8382v/when_i_thought_i_was_out_they_pull_me_back_in/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pglsqj/baba_3_day_rule_for_the_market_to_see_the/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pglvuv/baba_3_day_rule_for_the_market_to_see_the/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n1gjzm/eglx/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nv3ebj/abnb_from_fundamentals_to_technicals/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/otxtm1/nkla_is_gonna_get_shorted_to_the_ground/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8p6bc/melvin_is_out_new_shorts_are_in_why_this_is/) \n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n    \nHey /u/itsonlyfiat, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Positions in post and in here https://imgur.com/X8UjTcN", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.34182459115982056}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.37783488631248474}, {"body": "Came here for the confirmation bias.

Curious to see if Q3 data follows the trend. But if they like it at $226, a sentiment shift can well shoot up the price again to close to those levels on a first leg.
