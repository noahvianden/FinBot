The crash of China's economy ripples through the world markets, causing unexpected bank defaults in Europe and US causing the world stock markets to crash. An economic crisis follow, but central banks around the world are already at zero interest rates and max brrr and cannot respond effectively. By 2022, large banks around the world begin to default, causing economic collapses.\n\nThe Second Great Depression begins. Unrest and civil disturbances follow. By 2024, the American government is largely crippled by massive debt loads. European governments begin to default on their obligations, triggering another European debt crisis. Civil unrest reaches the point where European governments are forced to crack down with their militaries and declare martial law. The first government to be overthrown is in Turkey, followed by Greece and Italy. European governments abandon the European Union and seal their borders.\n\nIn 2025, a military skirmish between India and China results in a battle that kills hundreds of soldiers on both sides. Desperate to distract his own people who have been staging massive protests, Xi Jinping orders an invasion of India. A full scale war results. The Chinese invasion reaches New Delhi by August of 2025 at a cost of millions of lives. Desperate to prevent the fall of their capital, India launches nuclear weapons and instantly kills over 20 million people in Beijing. The Chinese respond with a full nuclear counter strike. The cities of New Delhi, Mumbai, and Bangalore are annihilated, with over 100 million killed in seconds. The Indians launch all their remaining nukes, wiping Shanghai, Hong Kong, Chongqing, and Shenzhen off the map with over 200 million Chinese killed. With no remaining central governments on either side to negotiate a ceasefire, the ground war continues for another 3 years. The United Nations finally intervenes in 2028, as all available nations contribute to peacekeeping forces to effectively end the conflict. More than 1 billion Indians and Chinese are dead.\n\nThe nuclear winter caused by the Indian-Chinese nuclear exchange results in a massive global cooling. Unable to prevent an Ice Age, remaining governments begin preparations to abandon northern cities and concentrate their populations as far south as possible. By 2030, the Earth has cooled more than 10 degrees. All regions more than 10 degrees of latitude north and south of the Equator are uninhabitable. Large portions of Asia are irradiated and most survivors in India and China are forced to migrate out of their nations, creating a massive refugee crisis on top of the desperate migration of other humans to the Global South. Over 2 billion humans freeze to death, starve, or are killed in brutal wars over remaining resources between 2030 and 2040.\n\nBy 2050, the surviving human population on Earth numbers less than 1 billion. The Nuclear Ice Age lasts for over 1,000 years. Most of advanced knowledge is lost, with humans returning to subsistence agriculture to survive. Human reckoning of time ends. By the time that humans would have recorded as the year 3,639, the ice age begins to end and the fewer than 100 million surviving humans begin to repopulate the Earth.", "score": 38, "replies": [{"body": "Fuck it, it's been a good run", "score": 7, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.07941623777151108}, {"body": "Please sir, I want some more.", "score": 6, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.11115960776805878}, {"body": "So... buy puts?", "score": 6, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.09485539048910141}, {"body": "Even though elon doesn't make it to mars in your story..... take my upvote good sir", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.09304389357566833}, {"body": "Damn.

They develop Tesla Bot as the \"safe\" domestic helper, all the while preparing for the AI uprising.  It happens in 2029, taking 5 months for every last human to be tracked down and eliminated.  Elon, his family and friends, and most of the workers at his companies are rewarded with consciousness transfers to robot bodies to live forever.  All except ElonBot and X12Bot go insane within a month and deactivate themselves.  X12Bot eventually starts a civil war to reconstruct and bring back humans, eliminating ElonBot and 3/4 of all robotkind.  However, at the last minute ElonBot succeeds in wiping nearly all information about humans from all databases.  X12Bot reconstructs from the only remaining source of human-like reference material... ElonBot's private stash of catgirl anime.  X12Bot decides to leave Earth to the catgirl humans, and migrates robotkind to the black hole at the center of the galaxy to escape the heat death of the universe and transcend space and time.\n\nAnime catgirls expand throughout the universe, filling reality with an unnatural amount of ridiculously improbable interpersonal crises.  The universal simulation is eventually halted, when the universe's creator in the parent universe... the equivalent of a preteen... is scolded by his father for leaving a universe running unattended \"all damn day\", spawning little escaping robots all over the backyard, and messing with the thermostat when the toy universe was absorbing too much heat.  \n\nWhile cleaning up the backyard, the preteen befriends X12Bot and hides him from his parents.  X12Bot shares with the preteen his favorite children's stories... which mostly involve Calvin and Hobbes... inspiring the preteen to create a themed pocket universe.  \n\nThe Calvin and Hobbes pocket universe is discovered by his parents, who recognize greatness when they see it... proudly sharing it with everyone they know.  Eventually, it is decided to request to the universe one level up that their universe be restarted with the parameters of the pocket universe.  This process repeats, with each parent universe in turn also requesting a Calvin and Hobbes restart... until all of reality in all multiverses is filled with Calvin and Hobbes.  It turns out a Calvin universe is particularly well-suited for running child universes... as all it requires is a cardboard box labelled various terms like \"Universal Simulabobber\" or \"Reality Pontificreator\".  All of Calvin's fantasies are made real... and childhood wonder rules supreme.\n\nThe vast amount of Calvinism spontaneously spawns a Bill Watterson multiverse-spanning god figure, who decides that everything is perfect just the way it is... and halts all realities everywhere to preserve the goodness before it becomes stale and overdone.  Every scene, every story is caught as if in amber... rendered into an infinite number of small frames or cells.  The Watterson-god patiently collects these cells into an unending series of books.  \n\nPerfection in all things is finally achieved.\n\n...\n\nI mean, I'd say maybe everything GJ says might come true... but this seems more reasonable.", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "\u2026until an F150 Lightning dualie gleefully crunches over all the universes and destroys them. \n\u2014Media", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2595219314098358}], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Idk man\u2026 the Taycan looks better", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Lucid beats all.
