Which I wouldn't consider dangerous at all considering that you can just fucking use a mirror or turn your fucking head like everyone had been doing for decades and on top of that the majority of people driving today still don't even have a rear view camera. So basically near zero actual additional risk of collision or injury as a result of this defect, it's a minor inconvenience at best and tesla are doing the right thing by fixing it.\r  \n\r  \nThe hood (frunk) of \\~14% of 2014-2021 Model S's have the potential to open unintentionally (only if the secondary latch is not engaged), resulting in the hood potentially blocking your forward vision. This is definitely dangerous, however in all of this time there has been only one report of this happening to someone while driving and thankfully did not result in any damage or injury. This is an actual issue with actual potential for harm, but has been addressed properly before any actual harm actually happened as a result.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n***This is my rough and uneducated interpretation of the openly available data which you should see for yourself and draw your own conclusions from. Don't trust me (a stranger on the internet) any more than you don't trust the obviously corrupt media outlets. If you think I misunderstood this information, please politely correct me.***\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nBy the way, just as a thought experiment, throw a dart at a board filled with any random assortment of other vehicle manufacturers in the same timeframe and I bet you will find significantly more dangerous recalls affecting significantly more vehicles with significantly less willingness to resolve those underlying issues.
