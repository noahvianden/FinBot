Technical Analysis - watch for resistance points where the stock has hit a price ceiling and has come down again and again, unable to break that price point, even in a hot market. Look for the RSI indicator being overbought at that point as that is often the signal others are using to get out of the trade. Then check how fast the price came down once it hit the resistance. If it hit it and crashed down fast, it likely means that price is not accepted. If it hits the price but keep on flirting with it, up and down, close to the resistance line, there is likely a breakout coming.\n3. Determine your desired profit target. If you did this at the beginning of the trade, you wouldn't have to think about it at the end. What is an acceptable amount of money to make?

{"title": "A near-term pullback, then the third bubble in 100 years is coming, says strategist. Here\u2019s how to get ready", "selftext": "Of the dozens of central bank meetings crammed into this week, the Federal Reserve is seen stealing the show with a tapering start and possible early rate-hike hints. After the \u201cworst inflation call in history\u201d and its credibility shattered, Chair Jerome Powell will need to take the reins hard, says Allianz\u2019s chief adviser Mohamed El-Erian. So we\u2019ll see if a potentially sterner Fed knocks the S&P 500, which glided to a new high on Friday despite nosebleed consumer prices, off the Santa rally path.\n\nOn to our call of the day from a team at Stifel, led by Barry Bannister, warning of another bubble for the ages, thanks to \u201cpoor monetary and fiscal decisions since COVID-19.\u201d And maybe enjoy any Santa rally while it lasts, as the team sees a near-term correction taking the S&P 500 toward the low 4,000s by the first quarter of next year. And then\u2026\u201cLater in 2022-23E, we believe the \u2018behind-the-curve\u2019 Fed might create the third bubble in 100 years, by 2023 to 6,750 for the S&P 500 (Nasdaq \\[approximately\\] 25,000),\u201d said the Stifel team.\n\n\u201cPopulism (which the Fed and Treasury seemingly embrace) leads to poor choices and even worse outcomes. Rate repression may again create a bubble that bursts (always do), followed by a lost decade,\u201d it said. It said investors should look to history for proof this can happen. The S&P 500 dropped nearly 20% in the third quarter of 1998 before the dot-com bubble burst in 1999-2000. A \u201clate arriving\u201d Fed tightening from the second-half of 1999 to the first half of the next year couldn\u2019t stop it, said Bannister and the team.\n\n\u201cThe same happened in the Roaring \u201920s, with a -10.7% mid\\_Dec-1928 drop as rates rose before the Oct.-1929 crash,\u201d the strategists added. The only way to prevent such a bubble would be for the Fed to heed its own financial stability report, where it warned over elevated risk appetite among retail investors and high equity and real estate valuations, and \u201ctilt hawkish.\u201d\n\n\u201cStill, policy may arrive too late, and if the market goes \u2018risk-on\u2019 with a falling Equity Risk Premium and if the 10Y Treasury Inflation Protected Security (TIPS) yield remains repressed at -1.0% due to global central banks, a P/E \\[price-earnings\\] convexity bubble in 2022-2023E may occur,\u201d they said.\n\nWhile the big one may be a way off, they offer a near-term survival guide. Bannister and his team said if both the S&P 500 and commodities weaken simultaneously \u2014 they expect that due to dollar strength, a China growth slowdown, Fed exit signals and tighter global liquidity \u2014investors can take refuge in S&P 500 defensives.

Tesla for eg again - even though car deliveries were fabulous - the increase made it shoot up over the Bollinger Band.\n\nIn general though, the next few days will see a somewhat recovery.\n\nFor Dow (DIA, DJI), it will keep dropping, since generally it must meet the moving average. On the other hand, NASDAQ (QQQ) could drop a teeny tiny bit more, but it looks like it corrected a bit too much - it's over the lower bollinger line. S&P500 seems to have somewhat passed the SMA line, so hmm.\n\nIn general, Dow will drop a bit, Nasdaq seems to be ok (for now). Then, when stocks go hot again, I would sell at the next time stocks seem extremely overheated (ie too close to Bollinger Band's 2*std line) - which in my analysis will possibly happen before inflation (Jan 12) or even FOMC (Jan 25/26).\n\nIn general, there does not seem to be any real market \"threat\" or bubble, as people keep saying. The yield curve (harbinger of recession) has actually recovered due to Omicron kind off being a non topic.\n\nHowever, if the US does in fact have issues dealing with Omicron (since the US has more comorbidities (ie Obesity)), the US could see a different picture than Europe.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Do you see the big amounts of debt and leverage taken by banks when they went insolvent in 2019 cause bigger damage to all this in the long term?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Actually no - I'll have to get back to you on that - I'll try to dig up some analysis :)\nI'm also writing my new analysis today - so possibly I'll put it there!
