{"title": "The effect of Elon\u2019s expiring options on TSLA (Part 4)", "selftext": "TL;DR TSLA go down then go up. TSLA lost 24% of its market cap since I published Part 1 of my thesis. Then I predicted a 12.5M share sell-off, which has just been surpassed and Elon is at 59% of his Twitter sell-off goal.\n\n[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qnhy0t/the_effect_of_elons_expiring_options_on_tsla/), [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qrhl5o/the_effect_of_elons_expiring_options_on_tsla_part/), [Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qv76ty/the_effect_of_elons_expiring_options_on_tsla_part/)\n\nFrom the recent SEC filings I updated the 2012 Award package exercise progress. I added a small early exercise in 2019 and updated the starting balance to all the vested options.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ Table 1 2012-granted and vested option exercise ](https://preview.redd.it/5718oj47gj681.png?width=748&format=png&auto=webp&s=304abddcdbe9cf56f61df82f4a53a984458a92cd)\n\nThere are still 6.4M options to exercise, which can be done in the last two weeks of the year keeping the current pace.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ Table 2  Elon\u2019s share transactions \\(negative denotes sell\\)  ](https://preview.redd.it/5pmoscv5gj681.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=ca1e4ef441f40b2a49f46607926c259d8ac93208)\n\nTotal sell-off progress towards Twitter goal: 58.64%. The big question is whether there will be a big chunk of shares sold the next two weeks. Sell-off will either flare up to 6M shares per week (similar to the first week of sell-off), or linger at 1-2M per week and go into next year.\n\nI made around $2K with long-dated TSLA puts and short shares. I have no idea what I am doing, but I am looking at getting shorter DTE TSLA puts hedged by SPX calls, in case the market decides to moon taking TSLA with it.\n\nSource: [https://www.sec.gov/edgar/browse/?CIK=1494730](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/browse/?CIK=1494730)", "id": "rk1ydj", "created_utc": 1639936706.0, "score": 71, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 80, "comments": [{"body": "Isn't he incentivized to sell before eoy because favorable tax rates will expire next year?", "score": 23, "replies": [{"body": "Microsoft CEO was incentivized to sell in 2021 because WA state has a state cap gains taxing starting in 2022.
