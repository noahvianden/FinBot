{"title": "-=>> 2022 TSLALounge Weight Loss Challenge / Better Health Accountability Group!! <<=-", "selftext": "**Background**\n\nDue to me gaining \\~40lbs during Covid, and knowing that 2022 is right around the corner, I wanted to use this reset of the calendar year as a trigger to lose some weight. Many distinguished folks I\u2019ve chatted with here throughout the year also suffer from the same fate so I figure, why not make this a group challenge? I first posted about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLALounge/comments/rne9uj/tsla_christmas_thread_december_24_2021/hq3cpgy/?context=3) and then [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLALounge/comments/rq7cit/tsla_daily_thread_december_28_2021/hqauwsz/), and, with the replies I received, it made it that much more important that I start this group to help each and every one of us.\n\n**The Idea**\n\nThe purpose of this group is to motivate yourself and fellow sub members to meet their fitness goals: this could mean losing Covid weight, or getting back to your health when you were younger or even beating a personal record. Whatever your fitness goal is, we in this group have your back and will help you reach it via **ACCOUNTABILITY!!!!!!!!!**\n\n**The Ultimatum**\n\nLadies and gentlemen, this is it. December 31st. This is your last opportunity to finish the Christmas cookies, finish the remainder of that lovely cheese pizza you ate when you were abandoned in your Chicago suburb home by your family, have that one guilty dish at your local joint that you are always so anxious/embarassed to order. **FINISH THIS GLUTTONY TODAY YOU FILTHY ANIMAL!!!!** May today be the very last day we engage mindlessly in our vices and start on our collective journey to reach our individual goals.\n\n**To participate, provide the below information in a reply to this post.**\n\n* 2022 fitness goal?\n* What Is your current weight and goal weight?\n* What is your plan of attack in 2022 to reach this goal?\n* Diet/restrictions to help you achieve this goal?\n* Exercise goals/gameplan?\n\n'\\* Scientific studies which I just made up prove that putting your goals into writing make them more real and harder for you to deviate from!!!!\n\n'\\* Ideally, you can reply to this post whenever you want to with your progress / how you're doing, etc. Also, bookmark/favorite this post so you can revisit whenever you need a reminder ;)\n\nParticipants can check in whenever they like on this ~~threat~~ thread and I\u2019ll be maintaining it throughout the year to keep all of our collective eyes on the prize and to keep us all motivated!!\n\n**Disclaimer**\n\nDont't be like my friend. He was up 30 pounds during Covid and tried this summer to lose weight. He immediately tried to run 4 miles like he used to do and guess what? He injured his foot so badly, he needs to see a doc for it now. And guess what? He's packed on more pounds. **START SLOW. TAKE IT EASY. EASE INTO IT (that's what she said!)! THERE IS NO SHAME IN TAKING BABY STEPS. THERE IS ONLY SHAME IN SITTING ON THE COUCH WITH YOUR BON BONS AND LETTING THIS ENTIRE FUCKING GROUP DOWN!!**\n\nLadies and gentlemen, together, we have increased our wealth!! **AND TOGETHER WE WILL IMPROVE OUR HEALTH!!!!!!!!**\n\nFolks who plan on kicking ass and chewing bubble gum in 2022 include:\n\nu/w00dw0rk3r\n\nu/Bob-Zimmerman\n\nu/ButterNight\n\nu/MrGatas\n\nu/Anono-mon\n\nu/dorkywhiteguy\n\nu/Boka_chika\n\nu/dr_turducken\n\nu/Durrblerg\n\nu/wsb_to_infinity\n\nu/McStonky\n\nu/TeslaM1\n\nu/SHOTGUN2HEAD\n\nu/reddituseranyonymous\n\nu/Super_Deep_On_Cell\n\nu/kewlboi88\n\nu/cvmke\n\nu/conndor84\n\nu/Tallicon\n\nu/PanGalacticGarglBlst\n\nu/gonal123\n\nu/uofaer\n\nu/grmphlwar\n\nu/mundane\n\nu/CANUHODL\n\nu/Sagetology\n\nu/Geodude27051\n\nu/Oriole5\n\nu/ShogunSG\n\nu/durrblerg\n\nu/therawstone\n\nu/valiryon\n\nu/kjudd11\n\nu/ragegravy\n\nu/z3n_rider\n\nu/McStonky\n\nu/omertacapital\n\nu/Achilies3\n\nu/selfmadeBread\n\nu/nitrocaffe\n\nu/dualcyclone\n\nu/magic-the-dog\n\nu/wetdreamzaboutmemes\n\nu/Mastiff99\n\nWe can do this together team!!!!\n\n\ud83e\udd1c\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udca5\ud83e\udd1b\ud83c\udffb", "id": "rsvd60", "created_utc": 1640961844.0, "score": 42, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 84, "comments": [{"body": "**2022 fitness goal?** Lose \\~40 pounds (\\~18kg) of Covid weight I've gained due to inactivity and being tethered to my desk like my computer\n\n**What Is your current weight and goal weight?** CW: \\~230lbs, GW: \\~190lbs\n\n**What is your plan of attack in 2022 to reach this goal?** I eat mindlessly, emotionally and out of boredom.
