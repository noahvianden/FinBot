I got myself a charger when we remodelled the garden, and having a charger bought a Hyundai Ioniq electric as a second car. Finally late March 2019 my Tesla arrived, one of the first in Europe. After driving it for less than a month I opened an investor account to buy shares, since it was clear to me that this was revolutionary.
