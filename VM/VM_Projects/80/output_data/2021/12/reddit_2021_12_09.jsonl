{"title": "BuzzFeed Fallout Worsens, Sheds 32% Since This Week\u2019s IPO", "selftext": "(Bloomberg) -- BuzzFeed Inc.\u2019s plunge after leaping into the public market earlier this week is accelerating.\n\nShares of the digital media company were down more than 14% to $6.58 at 12:43 p.m. in New York, putting them on pace to close at a fourth consecutive record low. BuzzFeed debuted on Dec. 6 after merging with blank-check company 890 5th Avenue Partners Inc., and since then it has shed nearly one-third of its value as the majority of investors opted not to participate, leaving the business with a fraction of the millions in funding it originally expected to receive.\n\nThe plunge by the company that Jonah Peretti co-founded 15 years ago contrasts with this week\u2019s 5.6% rise in the De-SP*C Index, which measures the performance of a group of 25 companies that came from SP*C reverse mergers. \n\nTo be sure, volatility in blank-check companies and the firms that go public through them has been pronounced after the offerings reached a peak in the first quarter of this year. The De-SP*C Index is down 47% from its Feb. 12 record, compared with a 19% rally in the S&P 500 Index over the same period.", "id": "rcqqvs", "created_utc": 1639082493.0, "score": 140, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 82, "comments": [{"body": "I didn't know they went public lol", "score": 150, "replies": [{"body": "Either did I until I read this post lmao.

{"title": "Wheeling: How not to? Markus Heitkoetter is this account blown up as of 12-03-2021?", "selftext": "This will be a super long post, but hopefully a good read.\n\nAt the beginning of the year, I had a newbie option trader ask me if I thought this guy knew anything. \"He sounds like he really knows something about options trading\" are the words they used.\n\nI checked him out on a link they sent me, watched a lot of videos at 1 x and then 1.5x and then 2x speeds to get through the nonsense. A lot of the videos were the normal standard basic options information. \n\nconclusion: Typical Internet trading guru, along with the self promotion of his guru books, and his new platform and trading strategy. They are always wanting to sell you something. SO after a few hours I had a good idea of what he was about. \n\nThe one thing that intrigued me was his new Wheel trading strategy series that he was starting.\n\nWould he be transparent on the trades, show enough information to follow and see if his claims hold up?\n\nI told the newbie trader not to pay anything to him, but to watch this series and learn. Most likely it will be not how to trade, but it would be better to watch and learn not to trade like this. The newbie gave me a link near the beginning of February. By that time he already had 6 videos on the Wheel Strategy account up. he was postiong about once a week. \n\nLink to youtube play list: [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBa3sAx-Io2kQMFb5UaY9mLx8kH7MOye0](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBa3sAx-Io2kQMFb5UaY9mLx8kH7MOye0)\n\nI had a lot of issues after watching the first 6 episodes which I told the new trader. The supposition of this trading account, is to prove that you can make a living off of the wheel. So it would be a real world example to prove that you can live off the wheel or not.\n\nMy Issues after the first 6 episodes: These issues are why I stressed watch and learn, most likely, learn not what to do.\n\nFirst 250k cash and claiming 500k. This told me he was already planning on being way over leveraged claiming trading a 500k account when it is really only 250k in real capital. This is just blatant mis-stating and a red flag for potential of blowing up the account.\n\n2nd the goal of generating 15k a month. That is 180k a year. He likes to live well off. Who wouldn't like making 180k year without doing anything but selling a few options. If you used his 500k claim that is >35% annualized return on the account. Possible in a single year, but sustainable to live off of for the rest of your life? No. Now using the actual capital of 250k it is still >70% annualized returns. That is pie in the sky, blatant lying. Red Flag #2 that this account is most likely to blow up trying to keep that promise, but since this might run only a year to prove a point we might never know. Rest of your life can be a long time. So 1 year is short and you can sellout and close it if it works and make the claim for years as you sell your books, and trading strategy off of this series.\n\n3rd, He didn't show all trades. He might have shown more in his \"paid\" daily trading room. But not in the video's he posted under this series. He uses TastyWorks. I have a Tasty works account and know the platform well. So the screens he showed I could gather a lot of information. The first few episodes you would get a nice screen of his open positions, and then on the summary month activity you could see what he traded at least. Just not actual trade details. The red flag were his stock picks. Remember this is Jan-Feb pick anything and most likely it will work. Still the picks I saw for the most part. Low liquidity, high IV.  Red Flag #3 These are high risk trades he is making to achieve the outsized gains.\n\n4th from his Jan 15 and Jan 29th videos I was able to calculate is BP being used in the account at over 60%. If we suffer a 5-10% market correction this account is blown up. In all likelihood at this point., this only confirms that he is willing to leverage to really unsafe levels. Red Flag #4\n\n4 big red flags after just 6 episodes. This will be fun to watch for the rest of the year.\n\nJan closed he withdrew 21k. It's what he actually earned. Realized gains on the tasty screen showed the 21k. Verified gains. This took his net liq back to 250k. Everything working to plan.\n\nI did notice at this point that he did have two accounts exposed for this in Tastyworks. His powerX 25k account, and his 250k wheel account. The size of the accounts were so different, I only took note. Nothing to raise a flag on.\n\nFeb appeared much like Jan. The Euphoria was still running, but we had realized a few shocks at this point. Still his realized gains matched on the screen and he pulled out 26k. 2 months in and he's 17k ahead of schedule. See this is easy, you can live off of 250k. I did track what I could for numbers in a spreadsheet for each episode. What he showed what he didn't and tried to work back to a reasonable number on net liq. Theory here since he is with drawing all of his realized gains then net liq should always hover around 250k. That original Cash balance he started with.\n\nIf you remember last feb we started getting the first concerns about the fed thinking about raising interest rates and possible inflation. SPAC's, anything that was interest rate sensitive, all took hits around the last week in Feb. In the 3/1 video there is a screen shot where the unrealized P&L for the month reads -15k. Realized gains were 26k for the month, So my net Liq calculation put him at 234k. Just a ball park, but definitely below 250k in capital. Not a red flag, but just a warning. trades can go bad it's part of the game. He's up 17k so has some cushion to work with. 2 solid months.\n\nAt this point I want to say, things have been fairly transparent. At least enough is shown that you can fill in the blanks and get the picture. We have 10 episodes and we have a good understanding of what he is doing, almost on a weekly basis. The wheel is looking good. 1 bad trade, but nothing that will take down the account.\n\nAnother thing, with all of his talking you can piece together his thoughts on his style of trading.  4-5 positions at a time. With his willingness to call 250k 500k. We know he is willing to use 100% of his cash. This means he is willing to risk 20-25% of his portfolio into a single trade. This is a definite risk factor. I won't call it a red flag, but it can turn into a red flag if a trade goes bad. Really bad.\n\nThe mar 12th video is the first time he leaves out details. He did not show his open positions for this video. He did mention he was having issues with his ride trade that he would most likely get assigned. Quick calculation by looking at the week before, This is a 30k loss. Unrealized, but still a loss. If I was going to guess his let liq is around 200k, down 50k from the beginning of opening the account. He has gains that he took out, but his working capital is shrinking. This is the halfway point of all of the video's posted. From this point on there will be less video's posted.\n\nApril 5th, market has stabilized and has started to recover from the march sell off, he does do his march recap. From screen shots we can see he has a real realized income of 16k. And an actual net liq of 207k. Unrealized losses are sitting at (-58k). BP used is 45%. On one hand he is still meeting is target goal of greator than 15k a month, but the unrealized losses are a drag on future earnings. Not a blow your account out, but definitely a drag on what you can earn in th future.\n\nApril 19th he purposefully hid available buying power, he also introduced his \"rescue missions\" on trades that have gone bad he's willing to double down, but only by buying in 1/3 at a time of the original cost. Theory is that it reduces the cost low enough. This is a super red flag in my book. You are throwing good money after bad. Opening yourself to even larger losses. At this point I estimate his ride unrealized losses are at 60k. I can't guess at his net liq, but it's below 200k. Just not enough information shown in this show.\n\nMay 3rd, if April 19th was bad at not showing anything. May was the worst. He showed the withdrawal from the tastyworks account site not the trading platform. He showed some open positions, but they were from the powerX account and not the Wheel account.  Red Flag 5. No longer transparent when he's suffering losses. Starts to hide information so that he will not look bad. At this point, it appears he's just drawing down capital and not really making  money. He withdrew 9k, first sub 15k withdraw. Still he's withdrawn 72k which is 12k ahead of target. his argument is the wheel works.  At this point, all we can do is wait and see.\n\nJune 1st, yes 1 month with no updates. The Open trades which he didn't show must be bad, still he opened up but doesn't display the YTD P&L. Net Liq is above 200k. SO if we work back, net liq, the withdrawals take. YTD P&L should be about 32k. So down about 50k in unrealized losses. It's being hidden from the user to see. but based on what is shown this is a decent guess at the unrealized losses he is carrying. 14k in realized gains, yet there is a 20% loss sitting on the books. At least no new red flags\n\njune 25th not quite mid month, but not month end so a bonus posting compared to as we go forward. June was a good month overall. You should be able to show gains. Net liq was not shown and enough info was not show to calculate. What was shown was YTD P&L and unrealized losses. 67k unrealized losses, 97 in realized gains, net 29k in gains.  with 72k withdrawn that is still putting net liq around 200k, so capital is down 50k.\n\nJuly 5th, wow actual realized gains shown like last month, this time 22k. Thing is,. some of these gains are really just lowering the underwater cost of RIDE. So not really a realized gain, if your are applying it to the cost to lower your cost and reduce your unrealized losses. I consider most of this 22k withdrawal just to be a reduction in capital. Net liq was shown and still around 200k. It only reinforces that no real money was made this month. Unrealized losses have only increased. Just think, June was a good month to make money, yet the account is basically flat.\n\nAug 5th, nothing was shown. Only showed a selected underlying and it's P&L for the month. There are some real losers out there that he is not showing. July was a down month. Another serious pullback, so he has probably added another loser to the list. Just not showing. Your guess is as good as mine at this point what the net liq should be. he still maintains that he can take out 16k beating the 15k minimum. I don't really think he met it if you required minimum net liq requirements. Just another drain on his capital.\n\nsep 2nd. Again a lot of not showing anything. This time he uses the orders sold and uses that has his realized gain. He sold 14k in premium for the month. This is just an outright lie. The only saving grace on at least some information was inadvertently shown is the realized and unrealized P&L 151k realized, 120k unrealized losses, net P&L 31k. If I was to guess at this point net liq is at 150k. It should be 100k higher if you want to do this for a living.\n\nOct 4th, same chicanery as the month before. This time the layout has been changed so that cap requirements on a trade are no longer visible. You can see the open positions but all P&L information is missing. This is the last Realized P&L and unrealized P&L shown. 160k realized P&L, 154k unrealized losses, only 6k made YTD net. took out  another 14k based on option sales. No realized basis for the withdrawal. Just another capital drawdown. Right now 155k has been withdrawn. Based on the losses and the funds taken out. maybe net liq 100k balance which most is tied up in stock ownership. Ride has been tearing him up, and the market pull backs have placed him into a few more losers, but we don't know since they are not shown. for the P&L on the stock holdings.\n\nNov 8th video, nothing really shown, we know what stocks are open, but cost, P&L, Cap Required, nothing shown. He doesn't even try to go over what he can pull out. My guess at this point he might have 20k in cash. Net liq under 100k. Any cash is being used fully to sell puts to generate some cash flow to offset the mounting losses. So withdrawals are still at 155k YTD. From october 4th earning are basically breakeven. 100k in net liq, hopefully, any free cash is covering sold put options. he can't withdraw without triggering margin call. My best guess.\n\nThis brings us to now, November rebounded strongly, just not in ride or his other losers. Those stocks are down for the count. Most likely for years. that leaves us with the 20k in cash. Even best case he might have generated a few K not 15k he would need. Black friday was a down event, everything went down just about, ride and his other listed went down just as much or even more. Last week the moves intensified. 12/3 was a peak down move. That close, based on what he was owning, could have triggered a margin call. We are now past the 8th and no update on this series. Even if he posts a miraculous 15k withdrawal. the account is in no shape to continue into next year sustaining the 15k a month withdrawals.\n\nI have no issues with the wheel in general. It suits people, especially when you come from only buy and hold. Buy and hold is taught to everyone at every almost every level of education. It's the basic given in our society, and wheeling only builds on top of this. The dangers lie in yield reach, unrealistic expectations, and convincing yourself that you would not mind owning the stock, for whatever reason. This series exposes all of the risks and how easily someone can justify the moves.\n\nThese dangers don't exist just for wheelers but all option traders. Yield reach is a big danger, unrealistic expectations is just as big an issue, even if you don't plan on owning, roll til right still sucks up capital that doesn't earn you anything.\n\njust looking at the october video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUrCb19SLRM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUrCb19SLRM) \n\nWe can safely assume that this year he has made more money off of his subscribers than he made trading the wheel in this account. the total account P&L was only about 6k.

The wheel is so simple to learn and run I can't imagine why anyone would pay anyone for help with it.  As I note every day, researching and managing a list of diverse stocks is where the hard work is and not the trading.\n\nThere can be some semantics about holding the stock vs having capital tied up trading CSPs, especially for those who have to use 100% of the stock cost as collateral.  A $50 stock will require $5K in collateral or $5K to buy the stock, and the goal is to earn premiums from this $5,000 being put at risk.\n\nIn most cases selling a CSP and making a profit from the premium is simple and straightforward by closing the position for less than the credit collected.  When the stock drops and assignment occurs things get more complicated as the premiums collected from selling puts will lower the net stock cost, then more premiums collected from covered calls (or more CSPs) will continue to lower the net stock cost.\n\nWhile I am in no way defending what is being portrayed in the above scenario, it is possible to have an overall net loss on the stock and still have the overall position be profitable.\n\nA quick example is selling CSPs on a $55 stock using a $50 put strike to collect premiums.  Selling 3 or 4 of these CSPs brings in $2.50 in premium, but the stock price drops to $45 and is assigned.  The net stock cost is now $47.50 with the stock at $45.  Selling more CCs to collect another $3 in premium means the net stock cost is now $44.50.\n\nThis means the overall position will have an overall net profit of $0.50 even though the stock has a $5 unrealized loss . . .\n\nAgain, I know nothing about the above but looking at unrealized losses on the stock will not tell the entire story with the wheel.  He may have large unrealized losses on a concentrated stock position that will eventually result in underperformance or losses, but without knowing how much premium was brought in the net p/l cannot be known.  \n\n**What I will tell you is that you are wasting valuable time watching junk like this when you could be spending that time doing in-depth research on stocks to make sure you are trading solid profitable and quality companies that you would not mind holding over a period of time to work back to a net profit.**\n\n**I'm a firm believer that trading a high quality stocks and being patient can result in an overall net profit nearly 100% of the time.  Where the wheel falls apart is chasing high IV and risky stocks that then drop and the trader doesn't want to hold.

This is what Markus is doing.  He has some bags, as we all do when trading, but the majority of the time he is only selling premium above his initial cost basis.

With that, he is getting far more premium than the average ThetaGanger is getting when he is correct.\n\nI don't Wheel so I am not sure about the margin requirements on a CSP but I remember from his intro videos he was looking to do 3-4 stocks and you use up all your buying power on those 3-4, with the idea if you get assigned you are in 3 positions at fill cash (I think).  I was also under the impression that if you have the leverage, the brokers will let you use it...otherwise, what is the point of the leverage?  So maybe he does overleverage a tad, but most of the time he isn't getting stuck in positions 20,30,40,50% down from his entry.

Once it did get assigned at $56 I then went into the mode of setting calls all spread out for 7 weeks ahead @$57. Then the bottom really fell out, and I thought I would then turn the CCs into covered strangles, and add small CSPs @ $53 spread out over 7 weeks as well. Several of the $57 calls have expired worthless which is cool, but I did have to roll forward the CSPs for two weeks. Now with the \"pop\" in the price, it's looking to allow some CSPs to expire worthless, while only barely looking to test the underside of the CCs.\nSo as each week goes forward, the plan is to just let the out of the money option expire, and either roll the other side, or let it get assigned/called and keep balancing the overall delta of all positions combined.\nI'm still learning that part, but setup some custom software to calculate it. \n\nI wish I could say all positions go like this, but they don't. Some don't have weekly options, and so it's hard to setup the 7 week slinky and I have to be \"monthly patient\".\n\nThis last period of stress for hi P/E and high IV stocks has tested me.

Once I did that, I began to focus on how to reduce that overall exposure. Sell or escape on sudden \"rips\" and resist the urge to buy or be bullish on \"dips\" until the overall exposure is improved.\n\nWe can watch those indicators our brokers give us like \"stock buying power\" and \"options buying power\" but they're not meant to be viewed as a gauge/instrument that you can use 100% of.

I have a few thoughts about him:\n\n1. His educational videos are mostly very good.  He's one of only a few people that go into detail about what a trading strategy really even is, including things like position sizing, risk management, when/how to take profits, entry and exit strategies, etc.  Everyone does videos about CCs, CSPs, PMCCs, how to roll, etc. (as does Markus) but I think Markus goes into a broader area of general trading advice.  He also has clear, simple, and easy to follow explanations and I've found his information to be very easy to digest.  He doesn't go into the same level of detail on other strategies but he has content that a lot of other channels just don't fuck with.\n2. He trades 2 strategies, the wheel and his proprietary powerx.  Powerx uses MACD, stochastics, and RSI with specific thresholds to determine if a stock is on a red, green, or black (neutral) day.  Buy in is when a stock transitions to a green day, sell if it stops being green or if profits are 2x the 7 day trading range, stop loss is at entry price - max risk per trade (I think he uses 3% portfolio size).  I like that this strategy actually defines risk, exit strategy, etc, but I don't think it's actually profitable.  He shows the \"trades\" from within his proprietary powerx optimizer on his 25k powerx account but he hasn't shown the actual account in quite some time.  Karl Domm (Real P&L) did a review of the powerx strategy and has a much better breakdown than anything I could ever give.  His 6-part video starts [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtBn_0R00DM) if you want to see for yourself.  The only criticism I have of Karl's review is what he said about Markus taking down the youtube comment; I think this was more likely either an accident or Youtube's algorithm fucking something up and \\*not\\* a deliberate or malicious removal of the comment by Markus.\n3. His 500k account I think can actually be called a 500k account.  It's 250k cash and then another 250k margin, however I asked if he has portfolio margin in one of his livestreams and he confirmed that he does.  I'm not sure if he is actually over leveraged or not but from what I can infer from when he shows his trading history on occasion (freeze the frame and you can re-construct a fair portion of it) I think he'd be over leveraged for reg-T margin but probably is still fine given that it's portfolio margin.\n4. He's still carrying a huge unrealized loss on RIDE (and I give him shit for that trade every time he's live on youtube) and he admits that he violated his own trading rules for taking that trade.  He seems to be very honest about it and I haven't seen him make any attempts to hide it or otherwise disguise the trade, although I don't know if this is the case for his other trades.  I don't agree that an unrealized loss doesn't matter until you sell.  Also, having looked at how he's averaged down he has indeed reduced his average basis by quite a bit on this trade so his unrealized loss is less than what is being shown in the account, however it's still quite a loss.\n5. He claims 50%-100% profits per year as his returns from the wheel.  I'm skeptical about this, especially given the unrealized losses on his RIDE trade, however I believe that his monthly profit claims in dollars are likely accurate.  He also claims similar returns for his powerx strategy but I've seen no evidence to support that claim.  The one thing that is clear is that he does actually make trades, so I don't think he's a fake guru that doesn't actually trade at all like some others out there.\n6. I think his attitude on getting assigned is a lot healthier than a lot of the people in r/thetagang.  He doesn't fear assignment either on CSPs or CCs.  If he gets his shares called away even if the stock is way above his strike, he just says \"yippee I made money\" and moves on to the next trade.  Same with assignment on CSPs; he just moves right into CCs and keeps collecting premium.  He's running the wheel \"correctly\" (in my opinion) and it seems to be performing in the way that it should.\n7. I think the powerx optimizer and his masterminds program (both of which are expensive) are probably not worth the money.  I would not use or recommend his powerx strategy EXCEPT to use it as a model for what a trading strategy needs to look like (e.g. risk management, position sizing, etc.) in learning to develop your own trading strategy.  His videos on position sizing and responsible use of margin have a lot of good advice though and are definitely worth watching.  However for a lot of his other videos, take them with a grain of salt.  There's still good information there though.\n8. He does seem to have changed how much information he's showing every month on his 2 accounts and is less transparent these days than he previously was.

Even the powerx strategy itself still is a strategy with a defined entry, exit strategy, position sizing to manage risk, and criteria for stock selection.  There's no evidence that the strategy is effective (I suspect it likely doesn't beat the market) but if you want to see a model for what a trading strategy needs to define then I think it's a good concrete example of the basic criteria that a trading strategy needs to address.  I use a totally different strategy primarily based around covered strangles and credit spreads but I built my strategy from the basic form that Markus teaches about those specific things.

It would take more time this year to blow up since the market deflated a lot in the areas he was wheeling.\n\nJust looking at his margin interest that he paid for the year in 2021, figuring it was the last 5-6 months, he was almost fully margined with 160k plus in margin debt. Tasty charges 8% margin, looking at what he paid for the year and knowing  for 2022 in that account he's probably just floating by. RIDE has certainty not rebounded and won't generate much in call revenue. Maybe enough to pay the margin interest he is still incurring and not posting as part of his P&L just for the ride position alone. $2 stocks don't generate much premium.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "why would it take more time to blow up if the market deflated?

I purchased PowerX March 2021 and It worked ok being that 2020 up until December 2021 were ideal market conditions but just about any strategy was ideal at that time  . PowerX uses the MACD, RSI above 50 and slow stochastics above 50. PowerX works best in markets that are trending up and his wheel strategy scanners works on down days also in markets trending up (down days offer more premium). With that being said, I used PowerX and the wheel scanner less than 10 times in 2022 which is why I asked for a refund. As far as transparency goes, he was very open in the beginning when anyone and everyone were making money in the markets and than he gradually stopped showing his trades. Towards the end I did get a scammy feeling when he started to do his \u201ccoffee with Markus\u201d in the middle of the day when most people weren\u2019t available. Also some of his \u201cmastermind\u201d members were a little too cultish for me.

Shit got a little fuzzy when they started to delete comments of people that were frustrated or displeased with the software.
