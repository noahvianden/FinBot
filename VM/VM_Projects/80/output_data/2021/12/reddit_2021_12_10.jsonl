{"title": "Ford is the Apple of the car industry.", "selftext": "I\u2019ve seen it said a few times that Tesla is the \u201capple of the car industry\u201d and while no such thing exists(no automaker will ever organically match Apple\u2019s divine profit margin) if there was an \u201capple of the car industry\u201d it would be Ford. \n\nThe reason being that, while Tesla has a lot of brand recognition within the EV space, if EVs are going to takeover(as they would have to for Tesla to even approach being worth what it currently trades at) then the EV industry will simply be the car industry, with the gas/diesel segment being the niche component. This transition will make Ford king. \n\nBranding:\n\nAlthough teslas upside down penis has made great strides in recent years, the blue oval itself is a brand Americans know and love, and their individual products also represent some of the most powerful brands in the car industry. If the iPhone is the king of smartphones, then who is the king of trucks? The f150. Just like the iPhone, there\u2019s other offerings, some arguably better and cheaper than the f150, but in terms of brand and market recognition f150 is the top dog. Same story with the Mustang and to a lesser extent the Explorer. All you have to do is look at the bronco sport to see the power of branding in the automotive industry. It\u2019s a rebadged Ford Escape with new stamping yet it sells like hot cakes because it shares a name with the traditional bronco. Don\u2019t underestimate the power of Ford\u2019s brands.\n \nProduct:\n\nNow, let\u2019s talk product. I am from Tennessee, and around here it\u2019s somewhat popular to make jokes at the expense of electric cars. But I think once the F150 lighting is on the road it\u2019s going to put the kibosh on that. If the Lightning does everything they say it\u2019ll do at the price point they\u2019re advertising now, it\u2019ll be a juggernaut, and since it isn\u2019t a door Tesla\u2019s douche-mobile cybertruck won\u2019t be able to stop it. You simply can\u2019t argue with a vehicle that hauls ass like a sports car and hauls junk like a truck.\n\nAnd Fords gas cars aren\u2019t anything to sleaze at either. The new Bronco took Jeep behind the barn in record time and their only response is an overpriced, 12mpg box on wheels to compete with the expedition/navigator. Also, they\u2019re slowly but surely rebuilding the Lincoln brand with great interiors and attractive exterior styling. After what they were putting out pre-2017, it\u2019ll take a while to reposition themselves but they will do it if they consistently invest in the brand as they have been. Meanwhile, the normal F150 continues to print money. \n\nThe issues:\n\nIt\u2019s often that people who are fans of a particular car manufacturer will fail to acknowledge any possible flaw in their pick, but obviously Ford isn\u2019t perfect. Their main two issues are dealerships and unions. I think at some point they will bite the bullet and start aggressively fighting to get rid of the dealerships. They\u2019ll never lose the unions obviously but it\u2019s only a matter of time before Tesla starts dealing with them and then Ford will be competitive on price or even be able to beat Telsa.\n\nTLDR: be a boomer. buy Ford stock. embrace it.

{"title": "Coinbase Will Steal Your Imaginary Girlfriend", "selftext": "Coinbase was founded in 2012 by Brian Armstrong.  He's the son of Neil Armstrong (first man on the moon) and cousin to Billie Joe Armstrong (Green Day).  $COIN is the largest code currency exchange in the United States by trading volume.\n\n**Who uses Coinbase?**\n\nCoinbase is in 100+ countries, and they have over 73 million verified users. Last quarter, Retail Monthly Transacting Users (MTUs) was at 7.4M.  They have $255B of assets on the platform.  Compare to RH, 22.4M funded accounts and $95B of assets on the platform.\n\n**How do they make money?**\n\nLast quarter they had $1.235B in net revenue, including $1.1B from transactions and $145M in subscription & services revenue.  The transactions revenue is really driven by code currency volatility, but the services revenue is sticky and fast growing.\n\n**What does the future have in store for Coinbase?**\n\n* Coinbase will be a hodler of non-fiat currency.  In August, they announced plans to purchase $500 million in non-fiat currency and use 10% of their profits to purchase more non-fiat currency in the future.\n* Coinbase NFT, a peer-to-peer marketplace that will make minting, purchasing, showcasing, and discovering NFTs easier than ever. They have over 1.8 million users on the waitlist to join.  [https://www.coinbase.com/nft/announce](https://www.coinbase.com/nft/announce)\n* Coinbase issued $2B in debt at <4% APR for product development and potential M&A\n* They announced a partnership with Facebook. They will be store non-fiat currency for Facebook's new digital wallet, Novi, which will enable users to send and receive money abroad instantly, securely and with no fees.  [https://blog.coinbase.com/](https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-to-power-crypto-custody-for-facebooks-novi-90dc8d3f5830)\n* Coinbase Card:  [https://www.coinbase.com/card](https://www.coinbase.com/card)\n* Coinbase Cloud:  [https://www.coinbase.com/cloud](https://www.coinbase.com/cloud)\n* Coinbase and NBA sign a multiyear partnership deal:  [https://pr.nba.com/coinbase-nba-partnership/](https://pr.nba.com/coinbase-nba-partnership/)\n* Kevin Durant signed a deal to promote Coinbase\n* And plenty of other innovation... browser extension, ledger integration, etc.\n\n**So what?**\n\n**Buy the stock! Sell puts!** \n\n* Oppenheimer\u2019s Owen Lau rates Coinbase as an Outperform with a $444 price target.\n* Lisa Ellis, MoffettNathanson Senior Equity Analyst, re-iterated her $600 PT on Coinbase.\n* Josh Brown likes it.  Kevin O'Leary likes it.  Bryn Talkington likes it.\n\nWhy wouldn't they?  The company has massive YoY revenue growth, and they have actual earnings.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Company|Last Quarter Net Income|Last Quarter EPS|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|$COIN|$406M|1.62|\n|$HOOD|$365M|\\-2.06|\n|$SQ|$80K|0|\n|$TSLA|$1.62B|1.44|\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**I pity the fool that doesn't buy $COIN.** \n\nConcerns - The transactional revenue will eventually get commoditized. The partnerships/services/other revenue is fast growing and will need to remain so for Coinbase to be sustainable in the long-term. Think about Vanguard, Fidelity, E-Trade, Charlie Schwab - they all survived the race to zero.
