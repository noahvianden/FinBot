{"title": "Here's why everyone's undervaluing Tesla", "selftext": "1) The chip shortage will continue well into 2022, [perhaps 2023](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/12/the-global-chip-shortage-could-last-until-2023-.html). Intel says 2023 and many others have too. Tesla's earnings reports shows its managing this better than its competitors. This is a crucial time in the vehicle cycle, as more people consider making a switch to EVs. Tesla is among the few able to deliver. That will reverberate for years to come (brand attachment etc).\n\n2) It's a mistake to see Tesla as merely a car company. It's an energy company. Look at the other things Elon Musk focuses on:  SpaceX, SolarCity, Powerwall / Gigafactory. They all create, store or need lots of clean energy. Batteries will be the key to storing clean energy. Whoever wins the battery wars will control the storage of clean energy: a multi-billion dollar business. If SolarCity takes off it will be key to generating electricity. SpaceX's strengths in space will lead to, I think, not just space tourism but [space based solar energy generation](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20201126-the-solar-discs-that-could-beam-power-from-space).\n\nEnergy is power. Whoever can generate, store and use lots of energy has the license to print money. The industrial giants of the last century were mostly related to energy. And so it will be in the future. I think Elon Musk is here to invest into and build cheap, clean energy. Tesla is the vehicle (pun intended) for that.\n\n(Disclosure: I own 8 shares in Tesla.)", "id": "qccir0", "created_utc": 1634768302.0, "score": 32, "upvote_ratio": 0.63, "num_comments": 83, "comments": [{"body": "I\u2019m not sure \u201cundervalue\u201d and \u201cTesla\u201d have ever been muttered in the same sentence .", "score": 108, "replies": [{"body": "OP should have said \"not overvalued enough\"", "score": 17, "replies": [{"body": "Lol.
