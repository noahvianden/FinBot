{"title": "Intel is not comparable to so-called \"value traps\"", "selftext": "I believe that the climate surrounding the discussion of Intel stock has caused it to enter the realm of hyperbolic discounting.  One claim I hear over and over again is that it is a \"value trap\" such as AT&T or IBM.  Luckily, we retail investors have data and the internet to be able to fact check such claims.\n\nTo do this, I used data from gurufocus and macrotrends. I plotted two graphs, one representing the PE at the end of each year, the other was the ROIC-WACC.  I chose ROIC-WACC (%),  because ROIC is one of the most important determinations of whether a company is doing better than an average index.  The results were surprising.  First, there is no similar comparison to be made of AT&T vs Intel nor IBM.  AT&T has an average ROIC-WACC of 1.2, IBM 6.9, Intel 10.7, Apple 17.4, and Microsoft 18.4.  A company with an average ROIC-WACC of 1.2 is not a value play.\n\nThe average 10 year ROICs were AT&T 5.4, IBM 13, Intel 17.8, Apple 25.6, and Microsoft 26.1. Intel's ROIC is well above the S&P average of 7.2 and yet the average PE is 27.6 vs Intel at a PE of 11.  I chose Microsoft and Apple for a comparison, because these two stocks were also thought to be a dying stock in the past.  However, often times there is a difference between a narrative being told and the data. ROIC-WACC was strong for these companies, and naturally they have done quite well, despite the news surrounding their demise.  Note that Intel now has a PE less than IBM and AT&T now.  While future ROIC is difficult to predict, Intel still has a good running ROIC, and with current interest rates, now is the best time for more capital investment because it allows WACC to be kept lower.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dpq7mfes5hv71.png?width=638&format=png&auto=webp&s=157108dc0c5af79f8c89882a77c1dac3e577a4c6\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gfqqgv3t5hv71.png?width=659&format=png&auto=webp&s=0aac75381d57329840726dde08d1ec7138960423", "id": "qf2z9b", "created_utc": 1635115040.0, "score": 84, "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "num_comments": 89, "comments": [{"body": "Value Traps 101\n\nStep 1 : Using historic data to predict the future.", "score": 111, "replies": [{"body": "Step 2:  Using comparators from other industries, while ignoring available data from representatives of the same industry such as Motorola, Texas Instruments, 3DFX, ATI, National Semiconductor, Rockwell Semi, TRW, VM Labs et cetera.", "score": 47, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.24787533283233643}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4199894964694977}, {"body": "who cares if they simply renamed their problems instead of fixing them?", "score": 41, "replies": [{"body": "INTC stock price gets beaten to shit, and they are still making $20 billion a year in profit, more than the *REVENUE* of AMD and NVDA combined.
