{"title": "Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation (Q3 Week 2) - $TSLA, $NFLX, $SNAP, $INTC, $CLF, $AAL, $VZ, $NUE and More", "selftext": "**Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation (Q3 Week 2) - $TSLA, $NFLX, $SNAP, $INTC, $CLF, $AAL, $VZ, $NUE and More**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhat's poppin' bull gang, hope you're ready for week two of earnings! This week is jam packed with companies reporting within highly volatile sectors, the most notable being steel and airlines, so keep an eye out for those! Alongside those, we've got a handful of boomer blue-chips pulling through, as well as the Netflix, who got relegated from FAANG in favour of Nvidia. There's a lot of money to be made this week, especially with [*collateral plays*](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays), so make sure you've brushed up on those concepts if you haven't already! Let's get into it.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#The Spreadsheet\nTo aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T-_0-_jgomORReMCZ4S4M4ZMnJkgGYoyPfe7zXvN_cE/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn\u2019t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you\u2019re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn\u2019t working for you, refer to [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T-_0-_jgomORReMCZ4S4M4ZMnJkgGYoyPfe7zXvN_cE/edit?usp=sharing) instead!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays\n\nBelow I\u2019ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- **Snapchat is inefficiently priced.** Since going public, $SNAP has had an average post earnings move of **17%**. At the time of writing, the options chain is pricing in a move of only **10%**. This priced move will ***shrink*** as we progress through the week since theta will decay the contracts, meaning we\u2019ll likely have a priced move closer to **8%** the day before the ER. Snapchat has ***never*** moved less than 6% post earnings since IPO, meaning that If you're gambling on this one, the odds are really in your favour. 6% minimum historical move, 17% average move, 8% priced move - The risk reward profile of this trade almost seems too good to be true. We ran this exact trade last quarter and made a huge bag, so I\u2019m really hoping we get to abuse this free money glitch again come Thursday. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n- **Netflix is inefficiently priced.** Same deal as $SNAP, just not as good. Netflix usually moves 8%, but options are only pricing in 5%. I don\u2019t like this play as much as $SNAP since a straddle will run you over three grand, and that\u2019s not exactly gambling money. Regardless, those with huge accounts and even bigger balls may opt to run this trade.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- **Airline stocks aren\u2019t priced properly (yet).** Delta Airlines tanked 5% post ER last week, resulting in the rest of the airlines also tanking 5%. $DAL closed the week down 6%, while the rest of the airlines recovered, ultimately closing out the week flat / slightly negative. This indicates to me that airlines aren\u2019t priced properly at all - Delta had an amazing ER and put out some banger numbers, but tanked despite that due to the concerns in rising fuel prices. Rising fuel prices will end up plaguing ***all airlines***, not just $DAL exclusively, meaning that unless the airlines put up mind-blowing numbers (which are also better than the insane numbers $DAL put up), **a downward move is likely imminent.** I\u2019m genuinely shocked that the other airline stocks recovered throughout the week despite the headwinds they\u2019ll all inevitably face during their ERs this week. Keep in mind, this analysis is made void if airlines slip throughout the week going into earnings as market re-prices them. I could be entirely wrong about this move - we\u2019ve seen time and time again that the market is extremely irrational.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- **Collateral Plays are your friend!** As displayed by the airlines last week (and hopefully later this week), stocks within the same sector tend to move together. If we\u2019re bullish or bearish on airlines, we can look to long or short $JETS, as almost all of its holding report earnings this week. The IV on $JETS is half that of the reporting tickers, meaning we\u2019ll get huge gains on a relatively small move. Most of the steel sector also reports this week! We can look to long or short the entirety of steel earnings by playing $X or $MT since we\u2019ll see a comparable move in those tickers as well, but won\u2019t get IV crushed. More information on these types of plays can be found [here.](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Summary and Conclusion\n\nWe've got ourselves an awesome week of earnings this time round! There's many trades that have a great risk-reward ratio on them this week, which is extremely odd considering that playing earnings is usually a crapshoot. Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T-_0-_jgomORReMCZ4S4M4ZMnJkgGYoyPfe7zXvN_cE/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people find the sheet useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment, it would mean a lot to me!

{"title": "Why is simple Dollar Cost Averaging still the king of all investment strategies? - Analyzing the last 3 decades of stock market data to find the best DCA strategy", "selftext": "By now we have all heard the virtues of Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) and that you should never try to time the market. Basically, it has been repeated ad nauseam that\n\n>Time in the market beats timing the market\n\nBut what is interesting is that I could not find any research that has been done on the best way to do dollar-cost averaging.\n\n**Theoretically, there must be a better way than to randomly throw your hard-earned money once a month into SPY, right?**\n\nSo in this week\u2019s analysis, we will explore various methods to do DCA and see which one would end up giving you the best returns!\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/xuwq9rr4f0u71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=05fea179292bdc2690cc032d6b09ce22bc4d8b2d)\n\n**Analysis**\n\nGiven that dollar-cost averaging is about holding investments long-term, we need data, lots and lots of data! For this, I have pulled the adjusted daily closing price & Shiller P/E ratio of SPY for the last 30 years \\[1\\].\n\nNow we have to devise different methods to do the Dollar-cost averaging that will maximize our long-term return. We will have different personas for reflecting different investment styles (all of them would be investing the same amount - $100 every month but following different strategies)\n\n**Average Joe:** Invests on the first of every month no matter how the market is trending (this would be our benchmark)\n\n**Cautious Charlie:** Invests in the market only if the Price to Earnings Ratio \\[2\\] is lesser than the last 5-year rolling average, else will hold Treasury-Bills \\[3\\]\n\n**Balanced Barry:** Invests in the market only if the Price to Earnings Ratio is within +20% \\[4\\] of the last 5-year rolling average, else will hold T-Bills\n\n**Analyst Alan:** Invests whenever the market pulls back a certain percentage from the last all-time high, else will hold T-Bills \\[5\\].\n\nGiven that we need to have some historical data before we start our first investment, I have considered the starting point to be 1st Jan 1994. So the analysis is based on someone who invested $100 every month since 1994. In all the above strategies, we will only hold treasury bills till the investment requirements are satisfied. I.e, in the case of Cautious Charlie, he will keep on accumulating T-Bills every month if the PE ratio is not within his set limit. Once it\u2019s below the limit, he will convert all the T-bills and invest them into SPY.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/s7yzrxr4f0u71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=65fae654765f7a942b8c01c131d2a2cd8f8dfebe)\n\n**Results**\n\nBased on the time period of our analysis, we would have invested a total amount of $33,400 till now.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/ssnejkd6f0u71.png?width=798&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9a5a0ca55bbf651c1ceaf71c2285ca1934092fb)\n\nNo matter what strategy we use, the most amount of returns were made by the Average Joe who invested every month no matter how the market was trending. A close second was Analyst Alan who accumulated money in T-Bills and only invested when the market dropped more than 1% from its all-time high.\n\nThe least amount of returns were generated by Cautious Charlie who only invested if the PE ratio was lesser than the last 5-year average (basically by trying to avoid over-valued rallies, he ended up missing on all the gains), followed by the Analyst Alan persona who waited for a 10% drop from ATH before investing.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/f89efls4f0u71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=68246916462c95c9f63f83082fe0d5594d30ef0f)\n\n**Limitations**\n\nThere are some limitations to the analysis.\n\na. Tax on the gain on sale of treasury bills and transactions costs are not considered in the analysis. Both of these would adversely affect the overall returns\n\nb. Since I am only using the monthly data for the P/E ratio and my SPY investments (due to data constraints), a much more complicated strategy involving intra-month price changes might have a better chance of beating the market (at the same time making it more difficult to execute).\n\nc. While we have analyzed the trends using the last 30 years\u2019 worth of SPY data, the overall outcome might be different if we change the time period to say 40, 50, or even 100 years.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/o9jenft4f0u71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=64f55e3d405346a4818e55f6ab4d82d981cc7863)\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI started off the analysis thinking that it would be pretty straightforward to find a winning strategy given that we are using nuanced strategies instead of randomly putting money in every month. I also checked for various time frames \\[5,10, 20 years\\] and various endpoints \\[Just before the covid crash, after the crash, before J-Pow, etc.\\]. In none of the cases did any of the strategies beat average Joe in the total returns.\n\nSince this is an optimization problem, I am [sharing all the data and my analysis](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JK4b-CYgvlSH-FqYvCBEve0RQ3ACmJNsmTwzLV7jqWs/edit?usp=sharing) in the hope that someone can tweak the strategy to finally give us that elusive risk-adjusted market-beating returns.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/z9h9ydi8f0u71.png?width=626&format=png&auto=webp&s=40ba2c60e207e0dd6de330950d35c934b6646280)\n\nTill we find our King Arthur, all of us average Joes can rest easy knowing that there is no simple trick that can give you a better return than a vanilla DCA strategy.\n\nUntil next week\u2026.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/w6wb49u4f0u71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=576e2d918b3e709926dcc3cc4885c9374238096a)\n\n**Footnotes**\n\n\\[1\\] The data was obtained from Yahoo Finance API and longtermtrends.net. While the P/E ratio was available for the last 130+ years, the daily closing of SPY was limited to 30 years.\n\n\\[2\\] We are using the Shiller PE ratio - this ratio divides the price of the S&P 500 index by the average inflation-adjusted earnings of the previous 10 years. This solves for the brief period in 2009 when the normal PE ratio went through the roof as the earnings of the companies fell drastically due to the financial crisis.\n\n\\[3\\] We are holding treasury bills as it has the shortest maturity dates and does not have a minimum holding period unlike the T-Bonds\n\n\\[4\\] The 20% cut-off is considered as it would be above one standard deviation from the historical trends\n\n\\[5\\] The idea of investing after the market pullbacks is driven by the following report from JP Morgan which stated that 70% of the best days in the market happened within 14 days of the worst ones\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/drtszst9f0u71.png?width=507&format=png&auto=webp&s=b50654b8d1dc5966f2e0ba9b098caca0b9d37719", "id": "q9yeo2", "created_utc": 1634476173.0, "score": 342, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 78, "comments": [{"body": "Have you compared this to buying 0DTE calls?

{"title": "TSLA to offer disruptive insurance product", "selftext": "Christ, I wrote a wall of text.  TL;DR:  TSLA Insurance is a big bullish pitch for TSLA, get in now.\n\nHinted at in a [tweet from Sep 19](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1439787653394747395) and this article about the [full self-driving feature](https://www.msn.com/en-us/autos/other/tesla-owners-to-soon-gain-full-self-driving-access-at-the-touch-of-a-button-prompting-criticism-from-regulators-and-safety-advocates/ar-AAONcOv).\n\nIn order to opt in to FSD, Tesla owners must consent to having data about their driving beamed back to the mothership.  Currently [TSLA uses 5 factors to rate a driver with a safety score](https://electrek.co/2021/10/14/tesla-officially-launches-insurance-using-real-time-driving-behavior-texas/):\n\n* Forward Collision Warnings per 1,000 Miles\n* Hard Braking\n* Aggressive Turning\n* Unsafe following distance\n* Forced Autopilot disengagement\n\nMakes sense, doesn't it?  The article links some sample insurance rates.  Safer drivers would be getting a substantial discount from their GEICO rate (the *de facto* industry standard); unsafe drivers might pay double. \n\nHere's why this is disruptive and interesting:\n\n**Car (and other) insurance made Warren Buffett his pile.**  In case you don't know, Berkshire Hathaway's core business is insurance, not just GEICO but General Re.  The investible idea is 'float' - insurance premiums are paid immediately, claims are paid later.  The result is that insurance companies at any given time hold a huge pile of cash money, some or all of which eventually must be paid out as claims, but which meanwhile can be invested for profit.  Musk has shown he's not afraid to invest Tesla's working cash aggressively - he gets it, his prior business Paypal was also a float business - and so a source of free float would presumably be quite valuable in his hands.\n\n**TSLA can rate better.**  Insurers have traditionally relied on 'the demos' - age, gender, occupation, income, education level, how much alcohol you buy monthly at the grocery store - all information that is available to them - in order to determine your premium.  It makes some sense, older people *on average* crash more than middle-aged because their senses and reflexes are failing, yet younger people *on average* crash the most because they are stupid and reckless and have higher risk tolerance.\n\nBut in those groups there will be some older and younger drivers who are a better risk and some middle-aged persons who are worse.  What better way of predicting how good you are at driving a car, than by analyzing how good you are at driving a car?  This gives TSLA a disruptive competitive edge over other insurers.  Most competitive edges are one-way - A does something more profitably than B, A skims the extra net profit that B can't capture.  But this is a two-way edge - TSLA skims off only the more profitable customers, shunting the less-profitable or even loss-creating clients to Geico, which is a one-two punch - TSLA Insurance wins, BRK/Geico at the same time takes a hit as its driver pool becomes composed of shittier drivers, causing their rates to go up and making TSLA Insurance even more competitive for the customers it seeks.\n\n**This burnishes TSLA's rep/image/PR/perception.**  For decades it's been the same: you want a safe car and cheaper insurance?  Buy a Volvo.  At this point Volvos are no more or less safe than other cars on the market - the era when Volvo had a 10-year head start on safety features is long past - but Volvos continue to have fewer accidents *because people interested in safety continue to buy Volvos.*  TSLA has an opportunity here to grab that PR crown and they are going to take it.  I don't blame them - seems like every time a Tesla crashed in the last 5 years it's made the news - and the availability of TSLA-specific insurance will attract a certain kind of buyer, the kind of buyer any car company would want buying their car.  And in fact, being surveilled continuously will probably actually make most TSLA drivers safer drivers, so it won't just be smoke and mirrors - it'll be true.\n\n**They have a captive audience**.  GEICO spends a hell of a lot of money on advertising - you know who they are and you know their mascot, don't you?  TSLA won't have to bother - they know exactly whom they're after and they have a channel to reach them without spending any ad dollars.  They can even restrict their promotions to the viewscreens in the cars with the best drivers, if they choose.  TSLA has already sold 1 million vehicles and they show no signs of slowing down - they literally make the market for this product.  $120 a month on a million vehicles is $1.44 billion in float every year, by the way - it'd be worth doing even if they eventually paid out $1.44 billion in claims.  And their addressable market will only grow.\n\nApologies if you read all this and already knew about it - I haven't been hearing much about it, thought it deserved a wider distribution.

That's what I really want to see.\n\nNot to mention macro economics, but that's another story.\n\nBut let me be clear, I think you are right in terms that insurance could be big for them and needs to be accounted for. I just think ultimately they will face competition in the insurance field, even with their own cars.  And I don't know how much their stock has priced into that. I want you to tell me how much money they could make from it.\n\nThanks\n\nEdit: Amazon never did get that high. I thought it did. But buying in 1999 depends on a lot of things. I mean if you bought all the way down... cool. But odds are you would've had abyssal returns for the next few years.

Amazon's price to sales when I bought my first 100 shares was 385, just as a point of reference - they had a negative P/E until very recently - and that and other valuation metrics scared me off buying more until 2011, although I never sold that original stake.  If I learned anything, it's that traditional valuation metrics simply don't matter when a company proves it can disrupt.  And they really don't matter even and especially when \"the thought of buying a share at this inflated value after a big run\" makes your nutsack shrivel up.\n\nIf Tesla can get to 100 million cars on the road worldwide in the next 20 years, insure only the top 30 million of those drivers, roll with $50 billion of float?  They'll be putting up BRK numbers.  Warren can make 20% a year on average on his sizable float when he bothers to invest it; if Elon can do even 8% that's $4 billion of *extra* FCF per year, about how much the $80B WarnerMedia acquisition was *supposed* to accrete to T's bottom line.  From this I hypothesize that it's worth about an extra $80B in market cap.  And those are very conservative numbers, you get an extra billion a year if TSLA only decides to insure the top 40% instead of 30% of its drivers.  And that's assuming break-even on underwriting, which is a shitty assumption at that scale; BRK keeps about 20% of its float year in and year out as underwriting gains, and so that's another $6 B for $10 B of extra annual revenue by 2040, which is worth an additional $200B of market cap.\n\nThere's a reason Ajit Jain's special talent with underwriting didn't get chosen to head BRK after Warren kicks it, by the way.  The reason is that the market is set to be disrupted by ubiquitous data and deep AI, which will outperform even the mind of that notable savant.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Ok thanks for the numbers.
