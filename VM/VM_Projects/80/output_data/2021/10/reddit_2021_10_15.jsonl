{"title": "CRISPR DD", "selftext": "CRSP is expected to report Q3 earnings near the end of the month. Q2 GAAP EPS of $9.44 beat by $5.59 while revenue of $900M beat by $483.6M. CRSP ended the quarter with $2.59B in cash at the end of Q2, compared to to $1.81B at the end of Q1. Operating cash flow per share for the three months ending June 30, 2021 was $8.78. CRSP is currently trading near its 52 week low which obviously represents a buying opportunity. \n\nCRISPR stands for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats. It is an incredibly powerful gene editing tool that which can have both human and non human applications. It has been used in food and farming to enhance nutritional value, and produce more durable, higher yield crops. More on that here: [https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/nph.14702](https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/nph.14702) \n\nJennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry (2020) for their work with CRISPR, however many scientists have done and will continue to do great work with this technology more on that can be found here [https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02765-9](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02765-9) \n\nCRISPR is currently being explored as a treatment for several illnesses including HIV, Several types of cancers, HPV, metabolic disorders and even UTIs.
