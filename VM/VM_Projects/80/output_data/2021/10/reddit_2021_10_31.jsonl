{"title": "Expected Moves this Week, AMC, Roku, Moderna, DraftKings, Peloton, Square and more.", "selftext": "### The Broader Markets\n\n**Last Week \u2013** **SPY** was higher by about 1.6% (or $7.40) last week, more than the 1% move options were pricing.\n\n**This Week \u2013 SPY** options are again pricing about a 1% move (or just less than $5 in either direction) for the upcoming week. With the SPY just under **$460** that corresponds to just above **$464** on the upside and around **$455** on the downside.\n\n**Implied Volatility** \u2013 The VIX ended Friday around 16.20, up slightly from the week before. The VIX remains below its historical average entering this week.\n\n**Expected Moves for This Week** (via Options AI)\n\nOptions are pricing similar market moves this week than they priced last week. Here are the expected moves for the week in the major ETFs:\n\n* SPY **1%**\n* QQQ **1.5%**\n* IWM **1.7%**\n* DIA **1.1%**\n\nAs an example of how the 1% expected move translates into strike selections, here\u2019s an Iron Condor with short strikes set at the expected move (based on the close Friday). It would need the ETF to finish between $455 and $464 to see Max Gain:\n\n## In the News\n\nThe FDA gave to go-ahead for a lower dose Covid vaccine from Pfizer (PFE) for ages 5-12. Moderna (MRNA) announced that the FDA needed more time to review its vaccine for the same age group. Both companies report earnings this week. Options are pricing about a 7% move this week and roughly a 13% move for the next month in Moderna.\n\n### Expected Moves for Companies Reporting Earnings\n\nThe *expected moves* below are for this Friday and link to the Options AI Calendar which is free to use. *Recent moves* on prior earnings start with the most recent quarter. The expected move is extremely useful for strike selection on debit and credit spreads and a gut check on existing positions. Stocks tend to stay at or within their expected move around 70% of the time and implied vol goes lower following earnings, in most cases. Therefore the expected move gives a general sense of what options are pricing for moves needed for debit options and what a stock needs to stay within for credit options trades. In other words, if the stock moves less than the EM, options were overpriced, and if more, options were underpriced.\n\nTuesday\n\n**AMC** AMC / [Expected Move: **10.2%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/AMC) / Recent moves: -6%, +6%, +4%\n\n**Zillow** Z / [Expected Move: **8.5%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/Z) / Recent moves: -8%, -6%, +18%\n\n**Activision Blizzard** ATVI / [Expected Move: **4.8%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/ATVI) / Recent moves: +2%, +2%, +10%\n\nWednesday\n\n**Roku** ROKU / [Expected Move: **7.7%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/ROKU) / Recent moves: -4%, +12%, +3%\n\n**Qualcomm** QCOM / [Expected Move: **4.5%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/QCOM) / Recent moves: +6%, +5%, -9%\n\n**Fastly** FSLY / [Expected Move: **11.7%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/FSLY) / Recent moves: -10%, -27%, -15%\n\n**Etsy** ETSY / [Expected Move: **8.5%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/ETSY) / Recent moves: -10%, -15%, +12%\n\nThursday\n\n**Moderna**\u00a0MRNA / [Expected Move: **6.7%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/MRNA) / Recent moves: -1%, -1%, +2%\n\n**Square** SQ / [Expected Move: **4.5%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/SQ) / Recent moves: -2%, +4%, -8%\n\n**Pinterest** PINS / [Expected Move: **9.1%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/PINS) / Recent moves: -18%, -15%, +5%\n\n**Uber**\u00a0UBER / [Expected Move: **7%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/UBER) / Recent moves: +3%, -9%, -4%\n\n**AirBNB** ABNB / [Expected Move: **6.2%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/ABNB) / Recent moves: +1%, +4%, +13%\n\n**Peloton**\u00a0PTON / [Expected Move: **8.2%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/PTON) / Recent moves: -9%, 0%, -6%\n\n**Cloudfare** NET / [Expected Move: **9.8%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/NET) / Recent moves: -2%, +4%, -6%\n\nFriday\n\n**DraftKings** DKNG / [Expected Move: **6.4%**](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings/DKNG) / Recent moves: +6%, +4%", "id": "qjwx6r", "created_utc": 1635708849.0, "score": 370, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 90, "comments": [{"body": "Is this a bot that posts these?
