{"title": "Due Diligence: The bull case for $DWAC and $TMTG", "selftext": " \n\n**Introduction:**\n\nFor anyone that points out that DWAC/TMTG/future combined entity is pre-revenue, then you're absolutely right. But this stock obviously is not about revenue now, but downstream profit potential. Obviously, any projection of this sort into the future is subject to a great deal of uncertainty, but I will do my best to quantify future prospects.\n\nAs a bit of backdrop, the whole merger process with SPACs is a bit complicated, but roughly current stock prices imply a value of $8B. Warrant prices imply a value of a bit less than $4B.\n\n**Overview of major business segments:**\n\nFirst, let us look at some of the potential segments of DWAC as a business:\n\n* Social media. The SEC filing announcing DWAC/TMTG merger specifically mentions Truth Social by name. Within Truth Social, we could see multiple elements.  \n\n   * A broad based social network (as an alternative to Facebook, cap \\~$1T)\n   * A microblogging service (as an alternative to Twitter, cap \\~$50B)\n   * A video hosting service (as an alternative to YouTube, part of Alphabet/Google but reasonable estimate of $500B value added). (Some thought DWAC/TMTG may acquire Rumble and could be announced tomorrow, but could be some other announcement by Rumble.)\n* Streaming media/video on demand service. The SEC filing mentions specifically mentions a product titled TMTG+.\n\n**Social Media deep dive:**\n\nLet's begin breaking down a few things. Facebook has \\~260M monthly active users in the US and Canada and 2.9B worldwide. Many of the worldwide customers are significantly less valuable, and the US/Canada market was responsible for nearly half of 2020 revenue. Likely, the margins are slightly higher in the US because it is wealthier than most. As a rough estimate, FB's North American portion of the business is currently valued at around $600B (of it's total $1T market cap).\n\nTwitter recently announced it had 206 million \"monetizable daily active users\" (not children) world wide. 25% of these, or 51 million are US based. The most recent data I have is Q1 2021, which shows about half of Twitter revenue is US based. In other words, Twitter's \\~50M monetizable users in the US contribute to a company worth roughly $25B.\n\nThese numbers fall in line with Metcalfe's Law, which states the value of a network is roughly proportional to the square of the number of users. Because FB has roughly 5 times as many users in North America than Twitter, than it should be worth about 25 times as much. $600B/$25B = 24, so we are pretty close here.\n\nSo what's this all mean? Let's run some scenarios. Suppose Truth Social is a free to use platform. The US and Canada populations are, combined, around 370M. Let's suppose for now 10% of this population uses the platform on a regular basis. I think this is conservative, as about half lean conservative, so this would imply one fifth of the target market engaged. If we apply Metcalfe's Law, we get to a value of (37/50)\\^2 \\* $25B = $13.7B. If 20%, rather than 10%, the value goes up not two-fold, but four-fold to $54.8B. If 25% (half of right of center), this pops to $85.625B.\n\nKeep in mind the above is values are ignoring conservative/populist movements in other countries which may provide additional revenues. Brazil (population > 200M) is a huge market with a populist Trump ally, and the CFO of DWAC is Brazilian. There exists a sizable populist segment in Europe, especially in eastern Europe as well.\n\nCritique 1: \"They don't have that kind of userbase yet.\"\n\nResponse: Absolutely true, and there is execution risk. However, current market values are significantly below long run potential. Personally, I think it is reasonable that 20% of America will be active, but discounting at 15% per year with 3 years to ramp, that is $54.8B/(1.15\\^3) = $36B current value.\n\nCritique 2: \"Advertisers will not want to advertise on the platform.\"\n\nResponse: That may be true to some extent, but companies still mostly care about $$$. Even if some advertisers refuse to use the platform those who use the platform may be met with higher engagement from users, who see a company that possesses similar values to them.\n\nOne last thought on the social media front: a monthly subscription as an ad-free alternative may be possible.\n\n**Streaming Media/On Demand deep dive:**\n\nTo begin, I think it is helpful to present some numbers of other streaming services.\n\n* Netflix, the behemoth, has 214M paid monthly subscribers. As of Sep 2021, annualized revenue is $30B. That comes out to $12 per user per month worldwide. The US figure may be closer to $15/month average.\n* Disney+ had 116M paid monthly users (and growing) as of July.\n* Discovery+ bundle has 18 million paid monthly users.\n* Peacock (NBC Universal) has 54 million users, with nearly 5 million using the premium (ad-free) version, with the other opting for the ad-filled version.\n\nWhat is the point? People are becoming much more comfortable with paying for a bundle of content they care about. Let's run some hypotheticals:\n\n* $15/month for streaming bundle\n* 20 million subscribers (about 5% of US/Canada or 10% of conservatives)\n\nThe above results in $144/year \\* 15 million = $3.60B of streaming revenue annually. Keep in mind, the type of content here is not likely to be extremely expensive to produce, like Netflix's huge investments. Suppose this can be produced at $1.5B. That's $2.1B in profit that that segment alone. A $2.1B profit. If it can expand at 3% per year from there with a cost of capital of 10%, that segment would be valued at $2.1B/(10%-3%) = $30B.\n\nObviously, we are not there yet. And risk to get there is large, but even discounting it by 15% per year for 3 years, we get $19.72B\n\n**Total Value and Current Stock/Warrant Price:**\n\nThe above gives the two primary segments a present value of $36B and $19.72B, totaling $55.72B. Even if you think I am being exceptionally generous and you think the company is worth 5 times less today ($11.14B), then the stock right now (valuation of $8B) is still 39% undervalued. Even if you think I am overvaluing the company by 10 times, then a $5.572B valuation (compared to $4B warrant), then warrants are undervalued by 40%.\n\n**The Trump Card:**\n\nThe final element here is to point out the obvious. There are 80 million Trump voters, over 100M Trump supporters, and tens of millions of other, who might not like Trump, but are tired of big tech censorship and monopolistic behaviors. Trump is a unique figure who has the capacity to funnel that energy and support to a particular business venture. His megaphone is unrivaled. Many of his supporters are supremely loyal and would subscribe, even while the product is unpolished, to show support to a movement.\n\n**Tl;dr:**\n\nThere is a legitimate case that the long-run prospects of DWAC/TMTG is massively undervalued.", "id": "qfz9ss", "created_utc": 1635225221.0, "score": 37, "upvote_ratio": 0.63, "num_comments": 86, "comments": [{"body": "Wait how can you do valuations without knowing what the deal structure is.", "score": 29, "replies": [{"body": "It can be inferred from this:\n\n\\> The transaction values Trump Media & Technology Group at an initial enterprise value of $875 Million, with a potential additional earnout of $825 Million in additional shares (at the valuation they are granted) for a cumulative valuation of up to $1.7 Billion depending on the performance of the stock price post-business combination.
