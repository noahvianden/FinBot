At the same time, I am not sure if the demand from Latin America is high enough already to put a lot of effort in it for Tesla. I would assume (with no further knowledge) that the charging infrastructure is lacking and therefore you have a chicken/egg problem, Tesla has no interest in solving because their resources are better spend elsewhere for the moment.\n\nSo I would say it will take quite a while (>3-5 years), before they have the resources to build Superchagers and have enough supply to ship to South America, at an attractive price point.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Appreciate your insight.
