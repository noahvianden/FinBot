One graph starts in 2012, another in 2000ish, another on January of 2019, and another October 2020.\n\nIf you adjust the offset so that they tell a consistent story, here's what they tell:\n\nThe hourly wages graph is the easiest one to work with. What that demonstrates is two things:\n\n1. Contrary to popular belief, wages are not totally sticky. Wage increases from pandemic work in 2020 didn't stick. Attrition and new hiring at lower rates and the reduction of temporary rates resulted in the return to what is essentially a standard acceleration curve.\n2. We're not actually that far out of the normal baseline curve. Slightly elevated, but well within the constraints of the market to handle wage acceleration.\n\nThe second easiest is GDP compared to inflation. If we adjust for the period offsets in these graphs, what you see is that after the supply chain disruption in 2020 (it's funny how quickly people forget not being able to buy toilet paper, meat, etc in mid-2020) once the market began to correct because the supply chain shifted from serving the corporate workplace market to almost entirely the home market, purchasing began to pick up. You already have inflationary forces at work at this point, but they're offset by deflation in some sectors that saw significant decrease during the pandemic.\n\nThis also coincides with the decline of the first major COVID wave in mid-2020, and you see economic activity pick up significantly since then.\n\nIf you'd have looked up consumer spending and capital velocity graphs, you'd see that consumer spending and the velocity of money also saw upticks in mid-2020 into mid-2021, correlating with the steep gap up in the economy to replace lost economic activity from early 2020. This creates a significant trailing inflationary force because the market, now experiencing high gap-up demand, is under pressure to provide renewed supplies.\n\nBecause the pandemic never actually ended, the supply chain and disruption issues continue, but because inflation comes AFTER consumers deplete supply due to demand, the inflationary curve begins to kick up AFTER the pressure occurs in the market. GDP begins to settle down at this point, but the inflation sticks for a while because it's taking a long time to replenish warehouses and because demand remains elevated coming further out of a pandemic.\n\nAs GDP declines, so too does the MoM inflationary acceleration. The end result of this is that consumer spending from July 2019 to July 2021 only accelerated by about 3% over 2 years, or an average of 1.5% each year, which is below the acceleration curve for the prior 20 years. In other words, it's not spending of excess capital causing the inflationary arc, so removing capital that isn't even in the economy yet by increasing rates does absolutely nothing. That'll increase return of capital back from bank reserves, but the Fed released like 10 years of capital into M2 and most of it isn't released into the market yet as evidenced by the lack of a significant consumer spending arc like you'd see if it was excess capital competing for goods causing the inflationary pressure.\n\nIf you correlated inflation with the Fed Fund rate, what you'll also find over the same period is further evidence of this, where the Fed fund rate doesn't correlate with inflation, and neither does M2/M1 because inflation is actually linked to capital in use, not capital in reserve. The majority of the capital in the market is effectively parked at any given point in time regardless of release rates.\n\nBasically. we're normalizing our economy and what most people are seeing as major isolated signs are really the normal stochastic remodulation that economies go through after an event like a pandemic.\n\nBecause we're going to see demand even out as this happens, if you pull excess capital out of the markets as we're experiencing a demand reduction the actual threat is generating too much deflation, since that will cause instability in the debt anchor for the economy since all debt is based off of the retention/growth of asset value as an anchor offset.", "score": 38, "replies": [{"body": "![img](emote|t5_2th52|4270)", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "Yea economic historians have seen this before - similar crap happened in the 20s, we had just ended a war, beat a pandemic and the fed went crazy.

You're doing the same bullshit every other overconfident reddit troll does and cherry-picking your information, removing context, and refusing to test your assumptions.\n\nThe wars in the Middle East were not the same as WWI. This is just you not understanding how WWI helped create the conditions for 1929. The Treaty of Versailles was punitive and heavily disrupted the economic engine of Europe, which deepened the conditions of the encroaching financial solvency problem, which was actually a result of a lack of stable risk offset against the market. At the time, Europe was basically the center of global economics... it's completely different from the War on Terror. Now there are other things happening right now which might be a threat that we can talk about, but that's outside of your argument.\n\nSpanish Flu is not theorized to have had any impact on 1929. This is just something you're conflating because you found a correlation in timeframe. The exuberance out of the Spanish Flu is largely regarded to have lasted a short period of time. In fact, there's very little economic data to point to any long lasting effect at all aside from an economic boost after it ended, which is entirely expected and hard to disentangle from WWI.\n\nFar from doing QE prior to 1929, the actual problem was that Congress, in a fit of isolationism, restricted International Trade, which heavily deepened the depression. 1929 and the early 1930s are actually an amazing argument AGAINST knee-jerk restrictive policies meant to box in economic growth. And as far as the gold standard is concerned, it's heavily accepted by economists that part of the problem was that there were no tools to address the liquidity crisis caused in 1929... which is why they ended it. 1929 is the ultimate nail in the coffin to the bullshit, ahistorical idea that the gold standard somehow avoided bubbles. It very obviously did not.\n\nAnd conflating that with taking unrealized capital gains on the 700 wealthiest individuals who are compensated almost entirely through capital gains that they cash in against yearly anyway is beyond absurd. All you're doing is demonstrating that you don't know anything about economics.\n\nIn fact, it's no surprise but you even lack the intellectual integrity and honesty to properly describe the thing that you're calling out, completely leaving out the very real constraints to the unrealized capital gains proposal... opting instead to fearmonger as if it's something that would apply to everyone.\n\nThis is the pattern from you.

Of course, that's impossible to completely filter, but how I compensate is through trying to look at the data and the context and what it's telling me. \n\nThe argument of Keynesianism, as applied by the Fed right now, isn't \"print forever\" but I think is better represented by saying \"flex capital relative to financial system risk.\"\n\nQE at the scale we're doing it is relatively new to our economy, and to understand the impact, we have to understand the purpose. I think the government made a big mistake in both 2008 and now by explaining the purpose of QE as \"dumping money into the economy to keep people fluid\" which is ultimately the purpose, but the true purpose of QE (I was an internal banking risk regulatory agent in a bank from 2008-2011) is actually to increase bank capitalization to reduce the capital impact and percentage relative to capital on-hand of toxic assets. This allows banks to keep lending, with a focus on cyclical payday lending and keeping the normal credit market running.\n\nIt's basically the equivalent of a margin call in the larger reserve system. Once that's done, and the risk is reduced, you can pull money out of the system.\n\nWhat people don't realize is that the FDIC increases capitalization requirements when these events happen, so most of that money gets stuck in the system to anchor against risk (like the risk of mortgages defaulting in 2020). That's the first place it comes out of when the Fed begins calling it back.\n\nWhile the intent isn't to continuously print money, and they didn't actually do that in the 2010s which is why the Fed had something they could do now to buttress the liquidity issue in 2020, there is definitely a reinforcing cycle where adding capital into the economy becomes a reason to keep it there, and I don't think the end result is that it gets clawed back every time... but that money isn't universally inflationary in part because banks act as a risk lever and aren't operating the way they did prior to 2008. Not saying banks and lending institutions aren't building risk, but it's not the same risk. There's less appetite for running lean now than there was before 2008.\n\nPart of the reason for that is that prior to 2008, there was a risk equation that dominated (I believe it was by a South Korean economist, IIRC) the financial sector risk space that basically suggested that highly risky assets can be packaged with less risky assets and hedged in order to increase profit, but it was taken too far and basically they packaged really toxic assets without any consideration for systemic risk. Things like the housing market were considered to regionally declining assets, not universally, in the event of a correction... so the idea of broader risk wasn't accounted for and excess risk compared to offset was done... think \"Countrywide.\"\n\nBut this gets us down to part of the problem with crashes and predicting them. I've spent a good portion of my life studying them, and lots of patterns that get attributed to crashes are, I think, too simple.\n\nCrashes are really, really rare, and so is stagflation... so you have to really dig into the systemics to understand them. Debt ratios matter, but they have to be put into context as to how they impact the system and whether or not they are offset by other forces/structures. It's really the system's ability to absorb risk that comes into play there. \n\nI have some work meetings to attend.

This is an artifact of people looking for simple metrics so they can predict them, and people have their own vested interests in certain kinds of behavior, but crashes are more complex than that.\n\nWhile things like debt ratios and the size of the market represent correlative functions that often correlate with crashes, the problem is that there are very few crashes to base these assumptions on, so the collection of data is few, and as such difficult to ascertain as predictive... and there's competing data that people tend to ignore because it doesn't fit the thesis.\n\nOne of my favorite problematic ways of predicting crashes is trying to match a market to VIX, which people do a lot. They're almost always wrong even though the thesis that VIX settles out before a crash is true... the problem is that if you backtest the thesis, what you find is that the vast majority of times it happens, a crash doesn't occur. Why is in the question of what VIX is. It's really measuring chaos (volatility) and its degree in the market, and so crashes generate very high volatility, as do the periods after them... so the natural tendency of the market over time is to build stability until the crash occurs... the trouble is then timing the condition of the crash. You might have a series small volatility incidents that help burn off weak market trends, like little earthquakes. Do lots of little earthquakes equal a correction? Maybe?\n\nBut do they equal a crash? And crashes are fundamentally systemic, not capital realignment. Crashes are not cyclical like the normal realignment of the market. So when people are measuring the VIX to look for crashes, they're not going to be predictive because it's not a predictive measure that backtests well.\n\nThings like debt ratios work the same way. They depend largely on the amount of risk offset in the market... capital, bonds, etc... the more offset you have, the more risk you can take on before you get into trouble.\n\nThere are several factors that lead me to conclude in 2005 that the housing market was going to crash:\n\n1. Houses everywhere were radically higher, but wages hadn't increased relative to availability and individual ownership was high. This was a very high risk-on situation.\n2. Variable rates in housing meant that a capital crunch, without a wage increase across the board, would result in a housing default and asset crash.\n3. That asset crash would reverberate to some extent through the rest of the economy (though I couldn't predict exactly when or how or how big... which was I think bigger than most predicted).\n4. The existence of a deregulatory regime in power ultimately meant that no policy to address the divergence event was happening. There's a common misconception that Laissez-faire economics result in more stable systems, but historically it's the opposite and crashes are often preceded by one of two things: Radically deregulatory regimes that refuse to intercede, or hyper-regulatory regimes that overplay their hand. Both are bad for the economy. You want a nice, slow, careful middle ground to avoid too much upset in the market, but you don't want to let the market do what it wants... because what it wants is equilibrium, but in its quest to achieve it will create instability, because it's irrational and unmanaged.\n5. We were currently engaged in several wars and entirely focused there. In 2005, what policies and spending were being prioritized were largely moving money out of Main Street, making things worse. That fed the divergence event.\n6. Other economic factors, like the rising cost of healthcare, were putting a crunch on people's pocketbooks.\n\nI could keep going on, and if you squint really hard this probably looks like right now. The thing is that we have actual domestic and infrastructure spending happening and that tends to produce significant dollar over dollar growth and return. We also have rising real wages and new budding industries. We have capital and significant risk offset, such as the growth of the bond market over the past 12 years. Coming out of the pandemic is generating consistent demand that will level out over time.\n\nWhat we have in 2008 is a divergence event... the kind that leads to a breakdown of the economic condition. What we have at the moment is a more convergent type of macroeconomic condition.\n\nLots of this, like healthcare costs and the cost of housing, are very real worries. Political strife also worries me. If we have a debt ceiling breakdown again and we can't get past it, the bond market will breakdown and that will kill the entire market. If we extract too much capital from the market too quickly, that will result in a crash and lead us into what looks like a coming deflationary event in the macro data. That could cause asset devaluation and as such a crash.\n\nThese things concern me, but without a solid systemic catalyst for a crash, the positive macroeconomic factors and just the simple fact that there's a ton of cash buffering the market looking for a home tells me that the economic engine is going to keep churning, and who's leaving all their money on the table when people are spending money in the economy?\n\nA lack of resolution for COVID also represents a risk. I think another big variant with a systemic mortality problem will spook people even more and that could be a bear thesis.\n\nWhat I want to see in a bear thesis is a solid systemic cause for the collapse that keeps it from recovering. Most of the ones on here are basically \"number too big\" or \"thing I don't like\" which isn't predictive of a major systemic crash. Something actually has to completely breakdown to make people take all of their money out without just dumping it all right back in again.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["vix", "crash"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": ">There was a law enacted in the 30s I believe? That stated that now banks were FDIC insured, but they had to follow federal regulation for that insurance. Banks used to be by and large the Wild West.\n\nCorrect. The FDIC was created for this purpose, and it's a big part of the reason why M2 release doesn't generally cause inflation the way that people think it would. If the banks had their way, you would see more risk-on lending during downturns and dangerous periods, and you'd see more crashes as a result.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>With that said about 2% would fail every year and forced you as a consumer to say okay, I need to be careful where I put my money. We no longer have that as they\u2019re all insured which I find morally wrong. Banks are a business like everyone else. If I had a business where I failed and the government said o don\u2019t worry bro here\u2019s all of the money you lost, it would be considered wrong. Again banks and businesses ARE separate entities, which I completely understand.\r  \n\r\n\nI think moral hazard has to be considered in the systemic context. The thing is that banks aren't supposed to be risk investments, they're supposed to be safe, so the FDIC tries to walk a fine line between protecting the interests of depositors and not providing a blank check to banks. In general, the FDIC will only replace losses that occur from specific events, like bank robberies, etc... if a bank violates regulation and puts everyone's money on black at a roulette table and loses it all, that's gonna have other repercussions (or rather, it should and the FDIC is not meant to protect that). \n\nI think the bail-out that happened in 2008 is a slightly different thing, there I think there's more of an argument against saving the financial system... but I also think that the cost of a crash is much greater than people commonly think. That's why the financial system had to be bailed out... it wasn't just a matter of some bad companies getting taken down, it was a matter of the entire system being taken down, including the state since basically the whole financial system was tainted because of the packaging and the depth of the problem. \n\nOne could argue that public stimulus would have been better than bailing out the financial system, but there are structural problems why that might not have buffered society as well as it should have in the time needed. In the end, QE was a good thing for the banking system... some of the things that came out of it after... not so much.\n\nLike for instance, another thing most people don't know is that QE/TARP funds and FDIC involvement was used to engineer bank mergers between shitty banks and good banks. The end result of that was significant banking sector consolidation, which I think is very bad. It did result in more banks with better accounting and risk profiles, so from the position of stabilizing the financial system, it was good. But there are other costs to reducing competition in the market that will eventually create negative conditions (already are, I think, but I'm thinking more problematic than we're currently seeing).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I do firmly believe we should\u2019ve fully collapsed to a depression in 2008. I\u2019m sorry but banks combining risky loans with good ones is bullshit.\n\nMy only problem with this is that it ultimately wouldn't have been the people who did the worst deeds who paid the price... they'd get out with golden parachutes. The rank and file would pay the most. Crashes destroy more lower and middle class wealth than anything else. Part of the reason we're going through a reshuffle of labor after the pandemic is because 2008 killed significant high pay jobs... or at the very least put the final nail in their coffins. Now we have a lot of manufacturing coming back to the United States due to the pandemic creating the supply chain problem and the end result is that you have a large body of displaced workers who were in the service industry who were furloughed and now have the opportunity to take advantage of access to higher pay careers, or go back to their old careers. \n\nAll of that would have been made far worse by a full depression. It's entirely possible that a full depression would have lead to a geopolitical security meltdown, too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>My real piss and moan about QE as a whole is the idea, that once you do it, it keeps the economy going ie liquidity then you find a way for the federal government to stop spending as much money and balance the checkbook so to speak, which they haven\u2019t done in years and simply kept spending.\n\nI like to disambiguate these topics. I don't know that QE is necessarily increasing spending. I get the idea that more capital promotes a reduction of concern about spending more dollars, but I think a lot of the spending is really happening either due to necessity or a lack of controls. This is really a complex political topic and probably strays more into politics than WSB would allow.
