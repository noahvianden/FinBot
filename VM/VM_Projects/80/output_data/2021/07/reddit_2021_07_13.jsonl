Interest rates are a real concern, however, they've been way too low for way too long and we'd definitely benefit from a sustainable increase. If we're talking macro-economics, the recent CPI spike is concerning, however the 10-year yield continues to drop, which means the bond markets are not as concerned. The debt markets are many times bigger than the equity markets both in notional size and trading volume. If you look at the M1 velocity of money, it's basically at an all-time low, which means even though the fed has printed a ton of money, it's not really finding its way into the larger economy. Both of these argue against higher monetary inflation. This could quickly change, but for now it's not spelling doom and gloom. \n\nIn terms of securities, I've always avoided options on ETFs/ETNs that are based on futures. IMO it makes more sense to trade the futures they are based on. I also don't fully understand the relationship between the underlying and the ETF/ETN.
