What is known though is Google, and others, are and have been infringing on a massive industry-shifting computer memory module technology owned by Netlist. In-depth research and due diligence are both out there on the web.\n\nConsider SK Hynix, who just paid Netlist $40m, cross-licensed all its patents fee-free to Netlist, and agreed to supply Netlist with $600m in raw supplies and products including Hynix Dynamic Random Access Memory Chips (DRAM), Flash memory chips (NAND Flash), and CMOS Image Sensors (CIS).

The Netlist-Hynix deal was undoubtedly strategic. No other defendants will receive the sweetheart deal Hynix did because Netlist only needs Hynix as the first domino to drop.\n\nThe amount of patentable technology Netlist holds in computer memory is significant.

Google, and others, played this game for over a decade. The Federal Court of Appeals, one step before the Supreme Court, affirmed Netlist\u2019s patents being used by Google and others. Google, like the others, did not proceed to the Supreme Court, clearly understanding they would lose in trying to invalidate Netlist patents.\n\nJust like Qualcomm overcame big tech\u2019s theft of its technology, now it\u2019s Netlist\u2019s time to get paid.", "score": 51, "replies": [{"body": "You got an estimate on how much it will be if they settle and if its jury trial?", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Looking at Google\u2019s consumption of Netlist\u2019s memory technology alone over the past 12 years, $1b is a conservative settlement estimate, or some mix of cash and future royalties equivalent to $1b.
