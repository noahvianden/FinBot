{"title": "Advanced Micro Devices: Bullish DD in collaboration w/ u/TheTendilorian", "selftext": "In response to DD posted earlier today by [u/TheTendilorian](https://www.reddit.com/u/TheTendilorian/), I saw an opportunity to steal the show for myself. (Kidding, [u/TheTendilorian](https://www.reddit.com/u/TheTendilorian/) did fantastic work and you can find their post on $AMD financials rightttttttttt: [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oe88ub/amd_su_bae_witness_me/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf).\n\n$AMD is easily my fav stock and I'm perpetually bullish on it, however there's a lot of catalysts that will have effects on $AMD both negative and positive at all stages. I'm not passing this on as financial advice, just my opinions:\n\n**Chip Shortage**\n\nThis one is the most significant situation in regards to semiconductors and the wider tech industry. In many cases it helps the bullish argument since $AMD (and[ also $NVDA](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/nvda/earnings) but fuckem) continues to exceed earnings estimates despite the rough environment. The[ expansion of $TSMC into America](https://www.reuters.com/technology/tsmc-says-construction-has-started-arizona-chip-factory-2021-06-01/), in my opinion, is going to launch $AMD into the fuckin' stratosphere over the next couple of years. Though still based in Taiwan, TSMC is one of the biggest players in global semiconductor production. As of March, $AMD was [\u201cTSMC\u2019s number one customer in regard to purchasing 7nm wafers\u201d](https://www.notebookcheck.net/AMD-overtakes-Apple-as-TSMC-s-main-7nm-customer.528532.0.html).\n\nAdditionally, let\u2019s talk about the economic giant we call China. I\u2019m an International Relations student so this is right up my ~~asshole~~ alley. While current President Biden has mentioned reversing some of the hardline policies of his predecessor President Trump, however there has been little evidence of progress towards that goal. Two weeks ago, the Biden Administration [blocked an attempt by a Chinese firm to purchase Korean chip manufacturer *Magnachip*](https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/06/22/biden-semiconductors-south-korea-china-trade-war/). A small company, sure, but we can extrapolate this stance to assume that TSMC could be off limits to Chinese acquisition in the future if the US and Taiwan can come to a formal agreement. Who knows how long this US-China measuring contest will go on, but the evidence suggests to me that it would not drastically affect the prices of semiconductor companies.\n\nBeing the massive pussy that I am though, I'm concerned about how an impending crash will impact overall liquidity and the supply and demand of semiconductor chips,[ which computing technology consumes about 1/3 of](https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/semiconductors/devices/how-and-when-the-chip-shortage-will-end-in-4-charts). But obviously if we all lose our homes, we would have bigger fish to fry than worrying about $AMD share price.\n\n**Innovation**\n\nI'm an avid PC gamer. I literally have nothing going on other than my Steam account and my Fidelity account. This is (not) a cry for help. IMO, $NVDA has the best net technology for GPUs. However $AMD offers more consumer-friendly products. I believe that $AMD cards offer the best value per dollar paid. (Unless you're one of those idiots paying 5 grand for a graphics card. I mean c\u2019mon, you can watch Pornhub Premium without an RTX 3080.) This catalyst is just going to be driven by overall consumer sentiment. If people begin realizing that their value is better spent on $AMD graphics cards, that[ market share](https://www.statista.com/statistics/754557/worldwide-gpu-shipments-market-share-by-vendor/) is gonna be gobbled the fuck up. Oh and processors? Yeah, $INTC is a piece of shit that I'm not concerned with. No source, just facts. Kidding, here\u2019s some cool charts [comparing processor performance](https://www.tomshardware.com/features/amd-vs-intel-cpus):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ltbr4vp74h971.png?width=1796&format=png&auto=webp&s=45c616a97d7eb16d80cc58ffd7cbe7b019680c6b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e6q6igj84h971.png?width=1839&format=png&auto=webp&s=f51f28cc2194bffa3e615f60ab09e0b9b661c7b5\n\nI won\u2019t lie, the new i9 5.1 GHz is an absolute beast, but the difference is almost negligible compared to the Ryzens, which are priced lower.\n\n**$NVDA Stock Split 20 June 2021**\n\nFuckin' $NVDA... always raining on the $AMD parade. I'm not angry, just disappointed. This stock split is actually pretty insignificant. Does this change any of the fundamentals between the two? Fuck no. Am I looking forward to it? Eh. Is there a point to me including this section? Kinda! As [u/TheTendilorian](https://www.reddit.com/u/TheTendilorian/) said to me, $AMD is a bit of a \u201clate-bloomer\u201d compared to $NVDA which can be seen as the current titan of the GPU space. I expect the price of $NVDA post-split (1:4) to be somewhere between $150 and $250 just based on previous prices and my exceptional arithmetic skills. While this is still above $AMD stock price, I think it will be easier to perform comparative technical analysis between the two companies when the prices are closer. Compare that with the fundamentals I wrote about earlier and you have got one bullish ass stock.\n\n**Price Outlook**\n\nIf I was Michael Burry and had enough coke and psilocybin I would tell you guys the price target a year from now. But I'm a broke college student with no coke and only a little shrooms, so it's whatever.\n\n\\- Short term I'm playing AMD calls pretty close to the chest. Currently holding 7/9 $95c and 8/20 $100c. I roll up or down depending on how the week has gone. $AMD has been trading sideways since the run-up last June with a high of $99.23 and a solid floor around $72-$73. For a quick swing of shares I try to enter anywhere under $80 and exit above\u2026 let\u2019s call it $86.50. As of now, I\u2019m looking out for an announcement stating the date of the Q2 earnings call (I\u2019m guessing August) and I\u2019m looking for $AMD to continue its run and retest $95 before a post-earnings dip.\n\nI\u2019ve charted pivot points for our current trading range as follows:\n\n$85.57\n\n$86.10\n\nPsychological resistance at whole values between $87 and $93.\n\n$93.55\n\n$95\n\nATH of 99.23\n\n[Here's what my $AMD chart currently looks like](https://preview.redd.it/wvvxr1105h971.png?width=1039&format=png&auto=webp&s=218b06ed3e405ab02dea6a7770212d2bb15f1d69)\n\n\\- Mid-term? I don't fucking know, get back to me if the market crashes. If not, 6-12months out, $100-$120 with a floor around $85-$90 just based on how we've been growing and the fact that resistance->support. As mentioned I\u2019m expecting a bit of a pullback soon since tech has been absolutely soaring the last two weeks, but seeing $85-$90 turn into support is not unreasonable in the near future. Honestly I\u2019m much more uncertain about mid-term compared to short or long time frames.\n\n\\- Long term: $NVDA levels. I believe with all my heart that $AMD is the better company and should be valued as such. They are a company that continues to exceed expectations and make great connections in the computing industry. For shares I would just buy and hold until I retire. (Mod who reviewed my post in its baby stages told me that \u201cbuy and hold\u201d was a questionable term to use. I\u2019ve heard the term \u201cinvesting\u201d passed around other subreddits but hell if I know what that means.)\n\n**Bottom Line**\n\nMe and my good pal Tendo heavily believe in this company, as I\u2019m sure many others do. No price target if I\u2019m going to take a 1+ yr position. Under $80 if I\u2019m going for a swing trade that will last one month or less.\n\nSo yeah, that's about it. Great DD[ u/TheTendilorian](https://www.reddit.com/u/TheTendilorian/). $AMD to the moon, not a financial advisor, blah-blah-blah. Who wants to see me lose half my portfolio this week?
