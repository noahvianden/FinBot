Tesla still offers the free hardware upgrade to those who buy FSD outright, but they do not offer it to customers of the subscription service. Fittingly so, because the subscription has no financial commitment beyond one month of fees. Tesla could end up losing a lot of money putting HW3 computers into cars that rarely ever end up using FSD, or even worse, given the supply chain shortage they might end up using chips that could have gone into a new FSD equipped cars that now have to wait for completion.\n\nIt's unfortunate Tesla was unable to stay true to their word about all cars being FSD capable, but like i said this promise was broken the day HW3.0 came out. In my opinion Tesla has done as much as is fitting to keep customers in this situation happy. As nice as it would be if even owners of older cars could try FSD for $200, it's simply not a fitting thing for Tesla to offer. The $1500 upgrade is in my opinion an appropriate compromise. Maybe someone at a service centre can knock that price down for you if you post your argument to them. \n\nMy recommendation though is for everyone who plans to keep their car 4 more years to just buy FSD outright now while they still can. At the rate that Tesla is improving FSD now i bet the price will be $15k next year and $25k the year after that, if they offer outright sale at all anymore by then. Subscription price will probably be $500 per month eventually, and upgrading to HW4 might be $3000", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "RemindMe! 1 year", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I will be messaging you in 1 year on [**2022-07-18 17:32:46 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2022-07-18%2017:32:46%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) to remind you of [**this link**](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/omn87z/tesla_demanding_another_1500_dollars_for_a_fsd/h5njw7o/?context=3)\n\n[**CLICK THIS LINK**](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Reminder&message=%5Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2Fteslainvestorsclub%2Fcomments%2Fomn87z%2Ftesla_demanding_another_1500_dollars_for_a_fsd%2Fh5njw7o%2F%5D%0A%0ARemindMe%21%202022-07-18%2017%3A32%3A46%20UTC) to send a PM to also be reminded and to reduce spam.\n\n^(Parent commenter can ) [^(delete this message to hide from others.)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Delete%20Comment&message=Delete%21%20omn87z)\n\n*****\n\n|[^(Info)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RemindMeBot/comments/e1bko7/remindmebot_info_v21/)|[^(Custom)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Reminder&message=%5BLink%20or%20message%20inside%20square%20brackets%5D%0A%0ARemindMe%21%20Time%20period%20here)|[^(Your Reminders)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=List%20Of%20Reminders&message=MyReminders%21)|[^(Feedback)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=Watchful1&subject=RemindMeBot%20Feedback)|\n|-|-|-|-|", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["pm"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.17827799916267395}], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "The new chip takes less than an hour to install and test.

They can't just start charging for a feature that they sold as being included with the car.\n\nThere probably exist two people who ordered Teslas 30 seconds apart in 2019, both of whom were promised that *whatever the cost* of FSD would be in the future, the **hardware would not be part of that cost** because **all necessary hardware was included in all current cars, regardless of if you bought FSD or not.**  I don't know how you can even attempt to contest this: It's on Tesla's goddamned website: [https://www.tesla.com/blog/all-tesla-cars-being-produced-now-have-full-self-driving-hardware](https://www.tesla.com/blog/all-tesla-cars-being-produced-now-have-full-self-driving-hardware)\n\n>Person B gets the option for subscription whereas person A doesn't\n\n**WHY?**  Why would person A not get the subscription?  Because, as you admit, the **ONLY** reason is because Person A's car **does not have the necessary hardware for FSD.**  The problem is, as I've been trying to point out to you dimwits, is that Person A's car was sold to them as **having the necessary hardware for FSD.**\n\nAgain, the deal was: If you buy a Tesla after October 2016 and don't buy FSD at the time of purchase, the price of the software unlock may change, but **the cost of the unlock does not include the hardware, because you already paid for the hardware in the purchase price of the car.**  So as it turns out, the price of FSD **DID** change.  It went from being only a 7-10k option to a $100-$200/mo option.\n\nI don't know how to say it simpler for the kids on the short bus: Tesla promised that all hardware to achieve FSD was **included in the price of the car,** and paying for FSD in the future *would not entail paying extra for any additional required hardware.*  **HOWEVER,** they have now announced that - *just kidding* \\- some people who want to pay for FSD **DO** have to also pay for necessary hardware that was NOT included in the purchase price of the car.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "They do not have any obligation to provide you a subscription option.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4618491232395172}], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4411593973636627}], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6851372718811035}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6610890030860901}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6941997408866882}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5561107993125916}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.28966131806373596}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6186871528625488}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6320755481719971}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.8030262589454651}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4015960693359375}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5956723690032959}], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.12705151736736298}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5814705491065979}], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.06111929938197136}, {"body": "It's money to start using FSD.
