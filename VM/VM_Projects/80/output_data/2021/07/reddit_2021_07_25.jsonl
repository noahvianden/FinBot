Meaning,  you buy it either you are bullish (you think stock will go up and you keep premium), or you are looking for share of company for a reasonable price to own the shares (which again this doesn\u2019t make since to me personally, because you can buy a call in the same company expiring 2 years from now, and in 2 years you can decide to exercise it or not, this way you have more contracts that basically doing same and you own more share in two years if the stock splits etc). But, if you just think about collecting premium, you should look at the stocks you don\u2019t mind owning it and have high premium. \nExample, TSLA low put for today $635 right now cost you $2.86, meaning if stock falls below $635 by weekend Friday,  you will own 100 stock for $635, even if TSLA is $620. Imagine this happening. If you are a TSLA believer you will OK and wait for TSLA to go up and you can even right every week one contract for 100 shares you have, if TSLA doesn\u2019t hit $635 (your actual cost will be $632) you keep $286 since you already collected $286 for your contract and you writ another one for next week. 2nd scenario Imagine now TSLA hits $631, you get delivery of your stocks $631 (but you agreed to buy it at $635 (strike price) now you own 100 stock of TSLA at $635. While its market price is 620. Here now you have, what you want but you are $11 in loss. If you are not a panic-seller, you can keep your stock and keep writing weekly covered call for $635 weekly until you reach back to $635! Or you wake up next Monday TSLA is back $640!

{"title": "AMD DDs (I mean TnA)", "selftext": "**The TnA:**\n\nOK, look... I'm not a financial advisor, or a stock broker, or anything like that so take my DD here with a big grain of salt. This is not financial advice. Do your own DD. Don't listen to a random dude on the Internet. You may lose money in the stock market. yada yada... if you lose your ramen noodles, I'm not to blame.\n\nAnyway, about a week and a half ago I was passively playing AMD stock buys during a work meeting and decided to do a little TA and noticed that there seemed to be a settling of the bottom end of a handle on a 4-month+ cup and handle formation in the classic form (round, not V-shaped) for AMD. I predicted that it might enter an upward swing in the next couple of weeks, which based on the classic cup and handle logic could run for up to 20 points.\n\nThen red Monday happened, and AMD ran green while almost everything that wasn't a COVID-fix stock ran red.\n\nThen AMD ran up the whole week. The trend for last week perfectly matched the cup and handle classic expected trajectory, and this is not just based on the graph. AMD had a solid consolidation phase in the mid-80s. The company has amazingly high sentiment not just in the gaming community, but across the tech field in general. They have multiple products in high demand AND in shortage. The sell-off position which started the cup makes sense as a profit-taking driven trend. The consolidation phase, being long and having a solid spike in the middle, represents a strong acquisition of solid holders for the stock, and the accumulation buy-in period makes sense on the right-end of the cup as an accelerated buy cycle matched with a gamma swing in buy volume.\n\n**I DREW SOME SHIT WITH CRAYON ON THE GRAPH, WANNA SEE?**\n\nTA is guessing at best, or finding things that fit your requirement, but when you see TA come up with a perfect classic pattern, you should take notice because either it's being formed by actions, or it's natural and people running algorithmic response have seen it and are now behaving based on the pattern (I work in fintech, I know how these people think).\n\nThe decline on the right of the cup makes sense as a patterned sales cycle for profit-taking with a little exit escape because of the run, but this isn't people running from the stock due to a catalyst. The prior run up matched Fibonacci buying sequences, hitting resistance at $95 just like the first spike did.\n\nI don't put a huge amount of value in just reading the graphs here, and often fib retracements just don't work, but with the stock price adjustment, a $96-97 stock resistance point following a $95 resistance point makes some degree of sense, and it also makes sense that algorithms would identify the same cup and handle trend here.\n\n**What are people buying on the options market?**\n\nLook at the options chain for July 30th. All calls are green, and up by a large amount, and all puts are running red with most in the negative double digits.\n\nThere's a MASSIVE number of calls waiting ITM on AMD for the end of next week, culminating at $135 at the $865million range IF the stock went above $135 at the end of the day.\n\nOf course, it won't do that, but $301m are already ITM at the current strike price, and look at the capitalization values of all calls at each of these ranges:\n\nAll current ITM contracts: $301,237,250.00\n\n$95 strike price:   $209,095,300.00 ($510,332,550.00 total)\n\n$100 strike price: $224,474,900.00 ($734,807,450.00 total)\n\n$105 strike price: $37,201,500.00 ($772,008,950.00 total)\n\n$110 strike price: $38,335,000.00 ($810,343,950.00 total\n\n$115 strike price: $38,444,500.00 ($848,788,450.00 total)\n\n$120 strike price: $2,112,000.00 ($850,900,450.00 total)\n\n$125 strike price: $3,525,000.00 ($854,425,450.00 total)\n\n$130 strike price: $5,395,000.00 ($859,820,450.00 total)\n\n$135 strike price: $1,606,500.00 ($861,426,950.00 total)\n\nOf course, many of these are covered calls and there will be lots of sells competing, so I don't expect all of these to add their value to the stock as it runs, but that's a lot of buy happening with the stock at the end of next week (and during the week if people exercise these calls), and that's not even taking into account the large amount of open interest in these options over the next week. Remember, too, brokers generally assign ITM options even if they expire because who's going to turn down profit?\n\nThe standing ratio of calls:puts next week already ITM is 1.33:1, meaning the market is betting for AMD and a little gamma event may be in the works.\n\nThe wildcards I see are:- Earnings on Tuesday- The FOMC meeting- Any random event which scares people on any given day.\n\nAMD did drive up during red Monday last week, though. Approaching Tuesday may be a bulltrap, so set your stoplosses if you're in the stock and feel it's necessary. Who knows what the Fed meeting will do to this stock market (anyone who tells you they know is lying, but odds are there will be panic even if it's just JPOW seeing his shadow).\n\nSo buyer beware, but if you're asking if there's any patterns suggesting AMD can run this week? I'd say these qualify. If this stock breaks $95-$100 this week, interesting things will happen.\n\n[AMD cup and handle](https://preview.redd.it/4bt4hzp5zbd71.png?width=1811&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ab348df7b2795fc35c667f308db359e55f8c2b4)", "id": "or8oya", "created_utc": 1627206262.0, "score": 105, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 80, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|1 month ago\n**Total Comments**|36|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 month|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2578331232070923}, {"body": "Says \"I know how these people think\", doesn't pay attention in meetings.\n\nSonofabitch, that's all the DD I needed \ud83d\ude00", "score": 33, "replies": [{"body": "Hahahah good catch!", "score": 9, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.09056147187948227}, {"body": "Fuck I was considering longing AMD till WSB started going long.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Don't feel bad, I'd have the same impulse.

I can say with certainty that if it were an all-or-nothing thing then gamma events wouldn't occur, but they do so obviously there's an effect even if it's a moving target as to how much.\n\nAlso, what do large funds do when covered calls gets assigned for a stock which is moving up in price? They buy back in. It's not like AMD is a one-turn stock with no future. THAT generates buy pressure.

If you were correct gamma squeeze type of events would happen after option expirations, but that\u2019s not the case. Most commonly the counter party that sells you the calls is the market maker. As they sell the call they buy shares to stay delta neutral. The calls are not fully covered because generally the delta <1. If the stock price shoots up, the delta goes up as well and it forces MMs to keep buying shares (also other calls but I\u2019m simplifying) to maintain neutral delta. This is done automatically with algos to avoid losses. By the time options expire they are fully hedged and the shares that were bought are either released or transferred off the exchange. That\u2019s why ITM option expiration doesn\u2019t impact the price anymore because its impact on the price already happened.\n\n\nAnyway AMD is good stock obviously, nothing against it, I like it too. But Mondays are not that magical.
