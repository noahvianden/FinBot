{"title": "I singlehandedly saved the market by fading myself", "selftext": "Yesterday around 3:40pm, as NVDA was dumping into the close, I considered buying calls. I always lose when I trade semis, but this time felt different. I knew that they would beat earnings and have another quarter of record profits, record growth. However, I also knew that if I bought calls they would've filed for bankruptcy effective immediately and completely fuck up the market.\n\nBecause of my unselfish behavior and deciding to not buy these calls, NVDA is now up to 317 at the time of typing this. This earnings call was going to guide the market for the rest of 2021. This may be the greatest fade of all time, and I've never felt better about fading myself. I actually might be the smartest man alive. Thank me later for all of your tendies.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUPDATE;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v5pbc7vmse081.jpg?width=1030&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c663c7438ac298dd2110ab91df2b01eb7fda80d1\n\nTried playing NVDA today after it broke 323, failed fucking miserably as expected.
