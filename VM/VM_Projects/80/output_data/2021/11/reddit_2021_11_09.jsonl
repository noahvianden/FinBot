The transition to a fully electric fleet for retail and commercial customers is underway, and there's really no reason for it not to accelerate from here. We already have governments around the world talking about banning the sale of new petrol cars within 10-15 years. Countries that are properly penalizing petrol cars for their emissions with relatively higher costs are seeing a significant (even majority) sales of EVs. And even in the US, where they're still subsidizing fossil fuel companies, and don't currently have a good EV incentive, are seeing strong YoY EV sales growth\n* Making EVs isn't as easy as switching your factories over from installing engines and gas tanks to installing batteries and motors. EVs have to be designed from the ground up to be competitive, and they need to change over a big part of the supply chain to an entirely different technology\n* So any valuation based on legacy ICE auto sales is pointless. Selling obsolete cars might generate some profit for 5-10 years, but investing money to keep your petrol cars competitive or even attractive, is just throwing money away. The longer automakers wait to transition all new development and manufacturing of EV, the worse it'll be. In general it seems like the investment community is pricing the legacy auto makers as if some, or many, of them will go bankrupt. And that the best case scenario might be to just collect dividends for a few years before selling off the stock at some fraction of today's value\n* I haven't seen a good comprehensive analysis of EV profitability among legacy automakers. But I assume that it's not good. Toyota, the world's largest legacy automaker currently doesn't have a single EV for sale. Many automakers have only low volume sales and/or only sell compliance cars at a loss. Even companies like GM or VW that are \"leaders\" in the legacy EV space are probably not making much profit (GM might be losing significant amounts selling EVs, offset by suing their suppliers)\n* We could be in a situation where Tesla is just about the only company that's actually making any real profit on selling EVs, which are the only kind of vehicle that's going to matter over a long term investment horizon. We could even be in a situation similar to what we saw with Apple where Apple was responsible for over 100% of smartphone profits, since the rest of the industry averaged a small loss.\n* From an EV profit perspective (and thus investment valuation) legacy automakers might be worth approximately nothing. All of the value might be in other EV only companies, even if they're currently only selling smaller volumes or are in limited markets, etc.", "score": 140, "replies": [{"body": "I agree completely \n\nTesla is among other things, a transportation company, which encompasses the automotive industry.

It will probably transfer from different one geographic area to another until they stop growing manufacturing volumes.\n\nWith >50% growth, they will basically be doubling the fleet every 1-2 years, and so service will have to scale and overtake manufacturing volumes in a sprint, then settle until deliveries catch up to service capacity, then another area will experience an unplanned rush of deliveries and fall behind until service catches up again, repeat until they start to reach steady state of deliveries and can plan a little more appropriately.\n\nSource: I worked in Tesla service for 4 years, planning out service capacity for 1 of those years.

There's little friction for customers to go from Audi to BMW and back.\n\nBut this is not inherent customer behavior:\n\n> People get new cellphones every 1-2 years which means every 1-2 years you can tempt them to switch, but people buy new cars every 7 years on average.\n\nInteresting that you'd mention smartphones: how do you explain that despite the high model frequency, the iPhone is used by over 80% of US teenagers? Where is the \"line-up variety\" consumers supposedly crave? \ud83e\udd14\n\nHow do you explain that for the entire smartphone market Apple has earned 90%+ of all profits globally for about a decade? Despite the much lower cost of entry to competitors? \ud83e\udd14\n\n> It means on average if someone bought a car in 2021, the earliest they will consider buying an EV is 2028.\n\nThe answer lies in your question: cars are switched infrequently, not just because they are expensive, but primarily because they are durable goods. So the same customers who can delay a new EV purchase can easily delay a new ***ICE purchase*** as well, by 1-2-3 years. The low rate innovation bites ICE OEMs here, 1-2-3 years model year difference is not a big deal if your car is otherwise in acceptable shape.\n\nSo most people will IMO ***defer*** the purchase of their next car - and we can already see this happening.\n\nJust 12 months of \"deferred purchases\" in 2008-2009 bankrupted GM & Chrysler and almost bankrupted Ford - while everyone knew that the slump in demand was temporary.\n\nImagine the vulnerability of legacy auto if their slump in demand is not temporary but permanent and irreversible: due to selling obsolete, literally toxic products inferior to EVs in almost every way ... \n\nMost people have no idea how dependent legacy ICE is on profitable ICE sales continuing, and how much they depend on scale. Just a 10-20% reduction in volume due to \"chip supply\" problems halved profits for a number of key ICE OEMs - despite them using the supply shortfall to raise prices and shift production to higher margin units...\n\nThis is a live experiment that demonstrates the highly non-linear relationship between ICE OEM scale and profits.\n\nIf we combine this with the very high debt levels of legacy auto, the very high capex levels required to transform to EV production and Tesla's almost oppressive advantage in EV manufacturing efficiency & profitability, it's hard to see much of legacy auto survive on anything but reluctant government bailouts.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": ">Interesting that you'd mention smartphones:\n\nNo you mentioned them first, what the hell lol.
