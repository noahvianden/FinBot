You may be wondering why this goes against what I said about consumer parts, and that's because it's got HBM, foveros and a lot of different chips connected by it, so it's way too expensive to plausibly make/sell as a consumer part.\n\nBottom line is don't bank on big revenue figures coming from GPU sales in the short-term, because consumer parts will be low to mid range and therefore short on margins, and server parts are slow to sell. They will be relatively good, and though they'll take time to gain market share, Intel has all the resources to not only make adoption fast and smooth for buyers, but also easy for developers to code for max efficiency (they've made a \"OneAPI\" that'll help with a lot of bottlenecks and inefficiencies, plus they're ahead of the curve with PCIe 5 and CXL).
