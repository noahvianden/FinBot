{"title": "DNUT ~ The fated trade; an insider train to tendie town", "selftext": "***TDLR***\n\nDNUT has a bullish chart, with insider buying post IPO when insiders would usually sell. they bought 123mil worth of shares in about a month. They also have lowered Q3 guidance and that quarter is usually just as good if not better than Q2 for their industry. Other in industry have crushed their Q3 ER and beat Q2. I believe they intentionally lowered guidance knowing they will beat so they can cause a pump of good news on ER which is tuesday the 9th (next week). Their EPS and revenue both should beat based off industry Q3 reports that just came out. Not only that but they should be better than their Q2 results. Im in calls for November and December $17.5 strike \n\n***Introduction***\n\nAs far as my research shows Krispy Kreme was once a public company that was taken private and now is public again. The company that owned them was JAB holdings which is now a beneficial owner (10%, which has been long bumped up to\u00a0 15%).\u00a0 They went from around 6million shares to 9million shares.\n\nThis is ABNORMAL, after a company IPO, the holders/owners Pre public release would want to sell and collect profits or just free up cash but these dudes go in and buy shares like there\u2019s no tomorrow. They bought all across the board and on various prices. The quantities they are buying in is abnormal and the time at which they are buying is also abnormal. Both are very bullish in my opinion. Unless they plan on going underwater then the stock price better go above $17. They literally bought 123mil worth of shares in about a months time... it\u2019s almost like an unannounced share buyback system. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Historical data cross analysis that cant go tits up***\n\nThis is me betting on the Q3 ER to be solid af which is next week Tuesday the 9th during after hours. I noticed they lowered their EPS expectations  which makes no sense since both time frames covered by the earning reports are peak restaurant months which are April through August. These dudes are playing the classical, lower guidance so much that you easily beat causing a price pump.\u00a0The  Q2 report was 349M in revenue and 0.08 EPS according to nasdaq (some sites were different at 0.13 like RH but most seem to agree/show that the forecasted EPS is 0.06 EPS and a revenue of 337.7M (all sites agree on revenue numbers). But we can see that they lowered guidance for a term thats usually the years best term for their industry and we KNOW it is the best term by comparing other chains earnings reports that just came out.\n\nFor reference McDonald\u2019s Q2 and Q3 are always similar but Q3 has been often higher. Q3 is the one reported in September \n\n[A chart for the lazy autists who dont wanna see the numbers, but link below is about 16 years worth of data supporting my claims](https://preview.redd.it/zqst3y95tux71.png?width=785&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b3928a0d5a0e18b01a46284b73dea68888cf3bd)\n\nStarbucks and other companies also follow a similar trend. Them lowering EPS to nearly half when it is often larger and will most likely be larger if it follows MCD and SBUX reports and trends  which it will as they seem to go hand in hand as an industry. They are GUARANTEED to beat the earnings and they know it which is why they are buy-in such large quantities of shares in an abnormal and non traditional post IPO fashion. \n\n***The chart \\~ for my astrology loving autists*** \n\nI will go from large time frames to smaller time frames, this is a very solid trade short and longterm trade hence I got short and long term contracts because I simply just love money!!\n\n[Candle sticks, confirmed morning star which is bullish](https://preview.redd.it/3ovzgl6hwyx71.png?width=957&format=png&auto=webp&s=562abcde4b07a7f8cc12693a9c6a5c88f9b9f155)\n\n[Daily, we in a descending channel which usually breaks up, we can see a mini trojan horse bull flag inside of it thats starting to break upwards with confirmation closing above R1 = bullish as fuck](https://preview.redd.it/tm48nzzexyx71.png?width=957&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e9a87eff9660517911cdccaa17208ebca0d2715)\n\n[On the 1hour frame we can see that we formed a bull flag whose price target is $15, this flag broke out closing above R3 (very bullish) and is working its way up. This is what I call a trojan horse flag since its breakout will trigger the breakout of the descending channel. Which will trigger more bullish moves on the larger frames](https://preview.redd.it/q0nj89m2yyx71.png?width=961&format=png&auto=webp&s=cdc39a4d615e66ed436802184028a02ae22fde20)\n\nThe technical analysis here should work like a domino effect and get us up to at least $16 in the short frame but the long frame is welp the sky, idk lol but anything under $16 will have insiders under water and I doubt they plan on losing money even if they have to fake deals and hype.\n\n***Position and the story of an autist***\n\nCurrently I am all in (about 1k) in calls, 11 $17.5 contracts expiring on 19th and 30 17.5 contracts expiring in December.(might offload some December in favor of the 19th since that fits my leverage tolerance a little more). I cant afford to lose this money as it is the last of my savings and ive lost everything else but I truly believe in this trade. I actually stumbled upon this trade after just crashing my last balance to $5 while searching Krispy Kreme donut prices and the ticker popped up so it has to be fate. I instantly did what any intelligent human being would do and deposited the last 1k of my savings and bought. Its also No Nut November and the ticker is literally DNUT aka da Nut, its literally the one NUT u bust after holding in for a few days and building up the horny energy, this nut is usually explosive with lots of fire power so my price target for this will be $20 post ER, in the short term then $30 by the end of November. Buying shares here is useless in my opinion, just trust the insiders, the cross analysis, and TA if the NUT thesis with all its might wasn't enough to convince you. This trade cant go tits up because it will go NUT up.\n\n***Conclusion***\n\nThanks for attending my ted talk, this isnt financial advice, just my attempt to document one of the most brilliant trade ideas I have come up with and eternalize it on this subreddit. Any gains to be made off of here are going to be 1 week for small and short term gains to genuine investing and holding as you'll be buying here at a premium cheaper than the insiders themselves. Im in options since I believe they won't flop the ER and will actually beat with positive guidance but insiders often buy and can hold for a year or two before announcing the actual news so that would be a safer bet but $14 to $20 or even $30 isnt enough for me of a return even if it was guaranteed. I want 1000% returns only at bare minimum and I want them now.If ER is positive which it should be then I think it'll run at least 30% in one week and be bullish going forward running up but perhaps at a slower pace and occasionally retracing back a lil kinda like SPY or any respectable companies bull trend.\n\n[https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/MCD/mcdonalds/eps-earnings-per-share-diluted](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/MCD/mcdonalds/eps-earnings-per-share-diluted)\n\n[https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/SBUX/starbucks/eps-earnings-per-share-diluted](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/SBUX/starbucks/eps-earnings-per-share-diluted)\n\n[https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/DNUT/insider-trades/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/DNUT/insider-trades/)\n\n[https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/dnut/insider-activity](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/dnut/insider-activity)\n\n[https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/DNUT/krispy-kreme/revenue](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/DNUT/krispy-kreme/revenue)\n\n[https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=DNUT](https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=DNUT)\n\n[https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/dnut/earnings](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/dnut/earnings)\n\n\n\nEdit: noticed this post is getting more traction now. To sum things up I made profit but I bought again on the 10% pump a few days ago and sold on the cash yesterday. Got nervous and didn\u2019t believe in myself. My fear stems because my parents will see my investing and I had my entire portfolio. I was wiped about 70%, the reminder went into V 225 FD\u2019s expiring this week. I have BPD and I don\u2019t think I should be trading/staring at charts too much since I act a lot on emotion. Hoping some of you here picked up the shares when I first started shilling em at $14 a pop.\n\nMy journey is over. I hope someone at least benefited from all this! \n\nAn no I always posted DD after I entered not when I was down. I was and always will be legit and honest. Not that there will be much in the future for me. If V rockets to $230 I\u2019ll have a couple thousand to yolo on the next DNUT ER unless it gets priced in....\n\nSayonara!", "id": "qnzehv", "created_utc": 1636202379.0, "score": 53, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 80, "comments": [{"body": "Please don't make me hurt again.
