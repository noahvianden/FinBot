An example is the various oscillator-based indicators like RSI, that might give some traders a view that a market is overbought and others the view that it's just getting started.  These tools don't give the trader precise signals that other traders will also fall in line with, but they can give the trader a barometer of the market (so to speak) that might influence trading decisions.\n\nSome tools base their entire theory on the mass human psychology at a herd level that underpins much of the market's movements, and if used correctly, can give surprisingly accurate short-term forecasts.  Elliott Wave Theory is one of them (and is one that I've studied and used extensively for years).

I was looking at the third to last image, where each ETF shows a bearish trend.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "VIX itself is a calculation that basically calculates how \"hot\" the wings on an option chain 24-38ish days out (rebalancing every so often to keep a the outlook relative to 30 days out). If volume goes up on the wings (because funds decide to up their hedges with options/spreads, in anticipation of volatility in either direction) or bid/ask spreads slide up (outsized demand for vol which drives premiums up as sellers are more incentivized to hold than sell) then vix can spike. If you're familiar with stats then it's basically a weighted variance across strikes, or mathematically modeling it\u2014a complex system with a lot of inputs and a single output. This kind of complexity means that VIX doesn't obey regular supply/demand like many other tickers where excess pressure on either side can push the spot price in that direction. \n\nAs to VIX exchange-traded products, it's a little bit more complicated. VIX ETPs have VIX futures as their underlying and VIX futures don't mirror VIX 1-1 since there are the elements of supply/demand of volatility and the time difference between VIX itself and the futures' expiration. **The short of it is that the price action of VIX ETPs like UVXY and others on the intraday are more measures of demand for volatility (i.e. vega) either as insurance (if long) or as part of a strategy (arb strategies, delta-neutral strats, clipping gamma wings if short, etc), rather than measures of realized volatility**.\n\nAs for the long of it.... well VIX futures exist and are cash-settled on expiration dates scattered throughout the year and most VIX ETPs use these futures as their underlying (often rolling the futures, which is why you'll notice that they're only supposed to mirror performance on the daily rather than all time....hence why, even accounting for maintenance/expense ratio, they decay). Yet what you might notice is that vix futures expiring three months out often will not mirror realized volatility nor will they mirror very well the nearest term futures (this gets into contango/backwardation and that's for another time), but since the volatility ETPs (like UVXY, which IIRC is levered like 1.5x or 2x) depend on these futures which don't match realized volatility (i.e. today's volatility) nor do they necessarily match VIX since the calculation is dynamic and it's tougher for supply/demand to \"copy\" moves induced from recalculation at the same time. If anything traders/institutions familiar with rebalancing will run an internal calculation of VIX with those new option wings and set their bids/asks to compensate for it earlier rather than later. \n\ntl;dr\nVIX as an ETP (UVXY, VXX, etc) is not necessarily a measure of volatility since there are other dynamics that muddle it. Volatility increasing thereby growing our odds of the trading range (over the next few weeks) expanding from, for example, a 5% range to a 9% range (I'm pulling these numbers out of my ass, they're stand-ins and not actual), i.e. spot price will travel within a greater range than otherwise.
