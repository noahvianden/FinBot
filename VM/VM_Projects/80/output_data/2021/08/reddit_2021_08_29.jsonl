{"title": "Tesla, diluted share count, and ARK research.", "selftext": "Let's talk about ARK for a moment.  ARK is very open with their research, which is more than can be said for most actively managed funds.  A few months ago, they released a Tesla valuation model that can be found on their github [here](https://github.com/ARKInvest/ARK-Invest-Tesla-Valuation-Model).  I don't care to comment on the assumptions of their business -- as 2025 hasn't yet come, it would just be my word against ARKs.  There is, however, an interesting assumption at the bottom of their Tesla valuation that I *do* want to talk about.  They assume shares outstanding will increase from 960M at the end of Q4 2020 to 964M in 2025.  This is integral to their per share price target.  \n\nLet's check how Arkk is doing on that assumption.  In terms of financial quarters, we're 10% of the way to the end of 2025, Tesla should be around 960.4M shares.  According to [Tesla's most recent 10-Q, pg. 1](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000095017021000524/tsla-20210630.htm), there are 990M shares outstanding as of July 22.  That's 7x the shares ARK assumed in 10% of the time.  But Tesla hasn't issued any new shares, so what exactly is going on here?  \n\nThe answer lies in the diluted share count.  Diluted share count includes all sources of additional shares that could be converted or exercised, e.g. convertible bonds, Employee stock options, warrants, etc.  These instruments are exercised over time, and the basic share count will tend towards the diluted count.  On pg. 13 of the 10-Q, we can see that including dilutive effects, Tesla's share count is closer to 1.12B.    \n\nThe utility of the diluted share count should be obvious.  If one is modeling a security five years out, especially if the projected price movement is bullish, it should be assumed that all outstanding stock options, warrants and convertibles will be exercised and added to the share count to create an accurate price target.  20% of Tesla's outstanding dilutive instruments have been exercised in the last six months.  Diluted share counts tend to catch up quickly.  \n\nWhy would companies dilute their shares like this?  Employee stock options can pad cashflow and convertible bonds' optionality can decrease interest coupon rates.  These are highly desirable among growth companies with poor cashflow and low/nonexistent credit ratings.  Tesla suffered from both of these problems for many years.\n  \nWhich brings us back to ARK.  ARK largely deals in early stage startups and growth companies.  They should see a lot of these instruments being used.  They should be intimately familiar with the effects of SBC, convertibles, and warrants.  Yet, they didn't consider these effects in their last two models.  This leads to three possible conclusions:  \n1) No one at ARK realized the model was made using the basic share count.  \n\n2) ARK intentionally used the basic share count to increase their price target.\n\n3) ARK's security analysts don't know the importance of using a diluted share count in this situation.  \n\nNone of these options paint a particularly rosy picture of the firm.  If you invest in ARK, this is the quality of research being used to make investing decisions.
