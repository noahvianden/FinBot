Please don't attribute moves like this to the ''short getting burnt'', or ''gamma squeezes'' or whatever. The entire short base could close their position in about 30 minutes.\n\nAlso... as a side note, it works the other way. After a profit warning, or a strong drop in shares, its good to see high volume to allow institutional investors to get out (10-15% of the total shares at the minimum). Otherwise you get that under performance for a few months after where every recovery is sold as a few investors try to slowly get out.\n\nEdit:  If you have 5 million retail investors, each with $2000 to punt at this stock, thats $10 billion in firepower. That's why these shares move. They can buy up the entire shareholding 10x over. Thats without leveraged options. These things always collapse, because eventually when its $2bn market cap, in order to lift the shares higher you have to find ever greater amounts of capital to move the shares.", "id": "pcuzq3", "created_utc": 1630094789.0, "score": 56, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "num_comments": 80, "comments": [{"body": "That first bit isn't purely true.
