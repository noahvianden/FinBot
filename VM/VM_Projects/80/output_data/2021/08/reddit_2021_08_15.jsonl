Here is my attempt at DD.", "selftext": "I have never had the stones to buy options, but maybe now is the time? \n\nOther than the ridiculous spike at the beginning of 2021, Baidu has traded down over 5 years. The 1 year is skewed, but if we look back at day for day, it was about $120 against current day $150. So if I had bought and held through the spike I would have still been up a very decent 25% in 1yr.\n\nNow, Baidu has a P/E of about 7. Compare to Baba at about 23, Tencent about 21.5, JD is at 14. Stateside, mega giants Google is at 30 and Amazon is running a 57 P/E. \n\nFinancials: assets have climbed steadily every year. They\u2019re cash positive with money in the bank. Net Income in 2020 was about 22.5B. \n\nAlmost every analyst I\u2019ve read says this stock is undervalued. $200 seems assured, and long term\u2026 who knows? 33% ROI is great, but 100% if it gets anywhere near ATH would be fantastic. \n\nThe big audacious goal he is their AI. They are the leader in China here, and I believe this will allow them some explosive growth in the future as autonomous driving becomes a reality, online search becomes increasingly driven by AI, and cloud business. This should allow it to rise above the competition from Bytedance, Tencent, Alibaba, and others for search revenue. \n\nThe obvious elephant in the room is the Chinese government crackdown on\u2026 everything. Short term, makes this very volatile. Long term, I think things stabilize and Baidu will be well positioned when it does. \n\nIf I did try and jump into options, I\u2019m not sure how I would approach it. Would love to hear your thoughts (obviously not financial advice). \n\nPosition: 30 shares at $192.\n\nTL:DR - Baidu is undervalued with a P/E half or better than competitors. China be crazy but I believe their net cash, growing revenue, and AI research will position them for 100% growth in 12-24 months.

You are literally gambling. \n\n2.  You are paying someone a premium (the cost of the option) to buy the stock for the price listed (the strike price) before the date (is he expiration date)\n\n3.  If the stock never goes above the strike price, then it is worthless.  These are called Out of The Money (OTM) options\n\n4.  The cost of the option is basically your bet at a casino.  And you\u2019re betting that stock will be higher than the strike price PLUS the premium you paid for the contract.\n\n5.  Example: if a stock is at $80 and you buy and option with a strike of $100 and you pay $1 for it then you need the stock to hit $101 in order to break even.  If the stock never hits 100, the option contract is worth zero.  If the stock goes to $110 then the contract will be worth $10.\n\n6. Why?  This is because the contract (the thing you paid a dollar for) allows you to buy a share at the strike price regardless of the market price.   You can buy the stock at $100 even though it\u2019s trading at $110.  You can get the stock and flip it and immediately make $10.  Because of this, you can also sell the contract to someone else and they can flip it.  Maybe they think it\u2019s going to 300.\n\n7.  All options are sold in blocks of 100 so you have to multiply everything by 100.  The price shown is for 1 share.  So $1 per contract is shown.  People only trade in 100s (blocks).
