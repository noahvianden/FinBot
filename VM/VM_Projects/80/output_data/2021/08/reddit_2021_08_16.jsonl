{"title": "Fed Officials Weigh Ending Asset Purchases by Mid-2022", "selftext": "Federal Reserve officials are nearing agreement to begin scaling back their easy money policies in about three months if the economic recovery continues, with some pushing to end their asset-purchase program by the middle of next year.\n\nIn recent interviews and public statements, several have advocated for this timetable, which would enable them to raise interest rates sooner than currently anticipated if the economy makes rapid progress toward their goals.\n\nThe central bank last December said it would continue the current pace of bond purchases until officials concluded they had achieved \u201csubstantial further progress\u201d toward their goals of 2% average inflation and robust employment. Officials at their July 27-28 meeting deliberated on two important questions: when to start paring their monthly purchases of $80 billion in Treasury securities and $40 billion in mortgage securities, and how quickly to reduce, or taper, them. The Fed is set to release on Wednesday minutes of the meeting that could provide further clues about those discussions.\n\nThe answers are important to financial markets because Fed officials have said they would prefer to conclude the bond-buying program before considering when to raise interest rates from near-zero. At their June 15-16 policy meeting, 13 of 18 Fed officials projected they would raise rates by the end of 2023; seven expected to do so by the end of 2022. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said at a July 28 news conference that the Fed was still \u201ca ways away from considering raising interest rates. It\u2019s not something that is on our radar screen right now.\u201d A recent run of strong hiring reports have strengthened the case for the Fed to announce at its next meeting, Sept. 21-22, its intentions to start tapering, potentially as soon as its following meeting in November.\n\n[https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-officials-weigh-ending-asset-purchases-by-mid-2022-11629106200?mod=hp\\_lead\\_pos2](https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-officials-weigh-ending-asset-purchases-by-mid-2022-11629106200?mod=hp_lead_pos2)", "id": "p5g1gt", "created_utc": 1629120425.0, "score": 484, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 85, "comments": [{"body": "Could someone explain what this means?", "score": 31, "replies": [{"body": "It means if I buy it will drop, if I short it will go up.
