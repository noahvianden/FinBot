{"title": "Options Trading Exit Strategies - A Guide to Exiting Trades with Maximum Profits", "selftext": "**Disclaimer : This article was written to supplement my Options Trading Exit Strategies video. Those looking for more in depth explanations and examples should refer to the video, which can be found on my profile. Happy Trading!**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nWhat\u2019s poppin\u2019 bull-gang, Flux here with an options exit strategy \u201cguide\u201d. I wanted to make this writeup because more often than not, I see people making fundamentally sound trades, only to have their gains vanish due to having poor exit strategy. They either get too greedy and hold on for way too long, or they exit way too early and miss out on an insane runup and want to die for a couple of days afterwards. There\u2019s two parts to each trade - an entry and an exit - and if you\u2019re caught skimping on either end, you\u2019re gonna be kneecapping your gains on a regular basis. Although this part of trading isn\u2019t glamourous, it\u2019s absolutely vital to your overall success as a trader, so it\u2019s crucial that you learn and study these concepts sooner rather than later. With all that being said, let\u2019s get into it.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Types of Exits\n\nThere\u2019s three types of exits that I tend to use when I conduct my trades, each useful in their own right. I\u2019ll give a quick summary of them all, before providing an in depth analysis and examples of each.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- **Fundamental Exits** pertain to any form of exit strategy regarding the change of a company\u2019s fundamentals. These exits usually take place before the fundamental changes since you\u2019re not going to be able to react to the changes in real time and you\u2019ll end up getting front run by algos. Examples of this include taking an exit during an earnings runup or rundown, taking exits before company related news events, or taking an exit before any market-wide news events.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- **Technical Exits** pertain to any form of exit strategy regarding a chart or an indicator - often a combination of the two. Once I see a pattern or indicator pass a certain threshold, I know it\u2019s likely time to exit my position. Some examples of technical exits may include exits taken around support and resistance levels, exits taken during gap fills, exits taken based off of technical patterns, and exits taken during the absence of any concrete patterns or indicators.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- **Psychologic Exits** pertain to any form of exit strategy regarding market psychology. This is the simplest of the three categories, and is often used in tandem with the other strategies to provide yourself with the best exit possible. Some strategies include exiting around whole numbers, screenshot theory, and individual gain theory. More on these later.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nObviously there are going to be a handful of strategies and categories which I\u2019ve missed, but the ones I outlined above are likely going to be the ones which are most common to us retail traders.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Fundamental Exits\n\n**Fundamental exits revolve around one key idea - Sell the news.** More often than not, the results of a given news event are already baked into a stock's price well before the news event is confirmed or actually takes place. As a result, the price of a stock will almost always DROP even if this news is \u201cconfirmed\u201d, because it was already priced in. This can be observed anywhere from earnings runups to product launches to fundamental news events. You may be wondering why this drop even happens in the first place - if the news is baked into a stock's price, shouldn\u2019t it stay flat when the news is confirmed? Hint : Trading Algorithms.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAlgorithms, or algos for short, are always behind the inevitable tanking of a stock's price post news event. It\u2019s quite easy to see why once you understand how these algorithms work. An algo can read through an entire earnings report / news transcript / whatever and fire off a corresponding trade in a fraction of a nanosecond, meaning that they\u2019re at a huge advantage since they **have the ability to sell the news after the news event hits.** This means that algos don\u2019t have to prematurely exit their position until they confirm that the underlying security was priced properly. If the underlying was priced to perfection, the algo takes its profits once the news confirms it (very common behavior among algos - take profits once there are no longer any catalysts in play), thereby causing the stock to tank. If the instrument wasn\u2019t priced properly, and there is a huge upside beat, the algo just stays in the trade and reaps the rewards, exiting at a later date instead. This concept is pretty difficult to wrap your head around initially, so let's go through an example.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**In our hypothetical example, let\u2019s say $AAPL has just reported earnings.** \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Scenario 1 : $AAPL is priced properly.** The ER comes out, an algo skims it, and confirms that $AAPL was indeed priced properly. The algo then takes its profits (as per common algo behavior), and dumps the position as a result of the priced in ER. Many other algos do the same as well, and the stock price \u201ctanks\u201d, resulting in a gap down the following day, and many left holding the bag, even on a seemingly good ER. Welcome to \u201cpriced in\u201d.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Scenario 2 : $AAPL is NOT priced properly.** The ER comes out, an algo skims it, and concludes that $AAPL was NOT priced properly. There was a huge upside beat. Instead of selling, the algo stays in the position because it knows that the underlying is undervalued based on the new news, and rides the wave up, exiting the position at a later date. $AAPL was not priced properly, and as a result, the news wasn\u2019t priced in.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn both cases, the algos win - they either escape with their profits, or ride the wave up for even more gains. **Us humans cannot act as quickly as an algo, and thus we\u2019ll always be at a disadvantage when it comes to fundamental exits. We always have to exit our positions prior to news catalysts to avoid getting front run.** News events are almost ALWAYS priced in. We can\u2019t sell the news AFTER the news drops because we cant digest and react to the news fast enough. We can\u2019t front run the algorithms, so we need to sell BEFORE any fundamental news catalysts, otherwise we run the risk of holding the bag. If there\u2019s one thing I want you all to take away from this article, it's that you should **always sell the news.**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n# Exiting Around Earnings\n\nThis is a very simple concept once we understand the mechanisms outlined above. If you\u2019re in a trade, always look to close it out before earnings (unless you wanna get rug pulled, in which case go ahead, I'm not your daddy). If the news is priced in (which it probably is), you\u2019ll get front run by algos and they\u2019ll steal your profits. Do not gamble on the \u201cpriced-in\u201c news being wrong. You\u2019ll lose that bet 9/10 times. Please note that even if earnings is a beat, that \u201cbeat\u201d can still be priced in. Please, exit your trades before earnings, or you run the risk of getting blown out due to your own ignorance.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n# Exiting Around Product Launches\n\nThis is similar to the concept we outlined above. In this hypothetical example, let\u2019s say $AAPL announces that they\u2019re going to reveal a new line of products in August. If that\u2019s the case, get ready to exit your position before the event. Every August $AAPL showcases their new iPhones for the year, therefore even though they haven\u2019t explicitly said they\u2019re going to reveal iPhones, the market is gonna price the event as if iPhones are going to be revealed. Once they reveal that their new products are in fact iPhones, the price will tank, because it was priced in, and algos followed the exact behavior outlined earlier. The only instance in which the price wouldn\u2019t tank would be if they announced that they\u2019re releasing a teleportation device or something. Believe it or not, the odds of that happening are astronomically low, so you\u2019re better off just selling before the reveal instead. Unless $AAPL comes out with something totally unexpected, the price will drop.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n# Exiting Around Fundamental News Events\n\nThis pertains to market moving news as a whole, like an FOMC speech or some macroeconomic event. If you know that JPow is gonna speak on Wednesday, it\u2019s probably best to exit your position before that since you\u2019ve honestly got no idea what\u2019s gonna happen as a byproduct of it. The entire market could take a shit or could fly green, nobody knows. Since we\u2019re traders, not gamblers, it\u2019s in our best interest to exit our positions or hedge in order to shield our gains. Fundamental news events are often crapshoots, and are the leading cause of solid gains getting unjustly erased in an instant.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Technical Exits\n\nTechnical exits pertain to any form of exit strategy regarding a chart or an indicator - often a combination of the two. In order to have the ability to do a technical exit, you must have a basic understanding of technical charts, patterns, and indicators. The entire field of technical analysis is easy to understand, but hard to master, so even if you don\u2019t have much experience in the area, I\u2019ll do my best to explain it all in a way which is friendly towards newer traders.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Exiting Around Support and Resistance\n\nThis is often one of the easiest exits to perform, as it\u2019s fairly straightforward to identify on a chart. **Whenever you start to approach an area which you\u2019ve deemed as a key level of support or resistance, consider exiting your trade.** If the price has bounced off of that particular level five times in the past, it\u2019ll likely hold true for the 6th time unless something has fundamentally changed about the company or the markets. As a result, you know that you should exit your trade as you approach the level, as it likely won\u2019t keep going in the same direction once we get to that point. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nAn awesome example of this would be the [$CLF chart.](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/9/9ymcqFZF.png) As we can tell, CLF trades in a nice ascending channel. In this case, we can use our trendlines to easily identify when to exit our trades in order to capture the maximum amount of our gains, saving us massive headaches. Once we get near any of the yellow trendlines, we should consider taking an exit since we\u2019re likely going to bounce off of it. Another great example of similar price movement can be found in [$AMD\u2019s chart.](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/l/LzNxfKpr.png) It trades off of supports and resistances very consistently, allowing us to bag consistent gains. However, unlike CLF, AMD often has breakouts to the upside or downside, making it trickier to trade in the event of a breakout.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nYou may be wondering if there\u2019s any way you can capture the EXTRA gains in the event that the support or resistance levels don\u2019t hold. Although I don\u2019t recommend doing it too often, a well placed stop-loss can help protect your gains in the event that we reject off of a support or resistance, while simultaneously KEEPING you in the trade if we break through the support or resistance. Obviously, you\u2019ll need some experience trading to know exactly where to place your stop, and it\u2019s going to vary from ticker to ticker based on IV and the type of security or derivative you\u2019re trading. A well placed stop-loss can help magnify your returns while also preventing you from giving up any gains you\u2019ve already locked in. Be wary, too tight of a stop could take you out of a trade entirely before a run, but too loose of a stop could cause you to give up too much of your unrealized gains. It\u2019s a fine line to play, and that only comes with experience.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnother way you could play breakouts is by using a two stepped approach. First, you take your exit once you approach a given level of support or resistance to lock in your gains. You then set an alert within your broker slightly higher than that given level. If your alert gets tripped, you know that there\u2019s been a breakout, and you\u2019re clear to re-enter the trade to then capture any extra gains that may occur once it starts to run. If I run this strategy, I make sure to set my stop under the newly broken support or resistance in order to preserve my capital in the event of a false breakout. In the end, this method is much safer, but it requires you to sit at your computer twiddling your thumbs waiting for a breakout, so I personally don\u2019t prefer it.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n# Exiting Around Gaps\n\nBefore we get into how to trade gaps, we need to understand what gaps are, and why they occur. [**Gaps are areas on a chart where the price of a stock moves sharply without any trades being placed.**](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/a/asVEHysx.png) Usually this happens as a result of a positive or negative catalyst affecting a stock outside of regular trading hours, resulting in a respective gap up or down the following day. A \u201cgap\u201d refers to a gap in the stock's price as a result of no trades being conducted within that range. Gaps are created because of low volume (technically no volume), and as a result, are prone to getting \u201cfilled\u201d very quickly. Once we are within the price range of a gap, it\u2019s very common that we will get sucked through the area with prices strongly trending towards the opposite side of the gap as a byproduct of the lack of volume.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhen trading gaps, we need to recognize two important levels, and understand how price will act around them. **The very last trade that took place before the gap was created will be a very heavy level of resistance, and the very first trade that takes place after a gap will also be a very heavy level of resistance.** As a result, we will be very prone to rejecting off of these levels, so we want to fully exit our trade around these levels, no exceptions. Once we\u2019re past the initial resistance, we can look to re-enter the trade to capture the rest of our profits.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nUnderstanding all of that, gap trades are relatively simple. First, we ride our trade up to our first level of resistance (the beginning of the gap, aka the price that the first trade was conducted at), and then take our exit to lock in our profits. Afterwards, we set an alert slightly above the resistance, so we get notified once we\u2019re past the resistance and are in the gap. Since we know there\u2019s no trading volume within the gap, there\u2019s a good chance we will get sucked through to the other side, meaning we should look to re-enter the trade as quickly as possible and then ride it to the opposite end of the gap (the end of the gap aka the price that the last trade was conducted at before the gap was created). Once we get to the opposite end of the gap, we fully exit the trade, because we know that 99% of the time we will reject off of this next heavy level of resistance. Gaps have a very rigid structure, and trade very similar to a breakout play. Enter a trade, exit at first resistance. Re-enter the trade after we break resistance, exit once we\u2019re at the second resistance.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**If this concept was unclear or confusing, refer to the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDKNRF_BZqQ) which has in-depth examples complete with visuals.**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Clear Skies and Falling Knives\n\nA clear skies situation refers to when a stock is on a tear and has recently carved out new all time highs - think [$AMZN\u2019s recent run to $3750,](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/6/6E9FplY9.png) or [$CRSR\u2019s initial run to $50.](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/e/EHxx1rVZ.png) A falling knife is the flipside of that, and refers to when a stock is essentially in freefall - like $NKLA when people found out Trevor Milton is a rat, or $WKHS when they lost the government contracts. In both situations, it can be extremely difficult to know when you should exit your trade since we don\u2019t have any technical levels to go off of, and as a result, we don\u2019t know when to anticipate a bounce. Even if we did have a general idea of where it was going to bounce, the market often over reacts, resulting in us blowing past our initial mark before starting our initial recovery.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**The simplest way to play these situations is with a trailing stop.** Trailing stops were invented for situations like these, and they\u2019re honestly one of the most effective yet under-utilized tools. Set the stop, and it\u2019ll trail the stock as it moves. When a stock is carving out new highs, or plunging to new lows, a properly set trailing stop will let you get as close to maximum profits as possible while still allowing you to stay in the trade if we experience some turbulence along the way. If your trailing stop is set properly, you shouldn\u2019t get stopped out of the trade from natural market movements, and will only be forced out once we\u2019ve found a new high or low. I\u2019m not going to teach you how to properly set trailing stops as that\u2019s beyond the scope of this article, but it\u2019s something I may write about in the future given that enough people are interested.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Alternatively, if you want to abuse basic human psychology, you could also look to exit your position around whole numbers.** Humans are weird creatures, in the sense that we like \u201cwhole\u201d things - stock prices are no exception. You better believe there\u2019s going to be buyers or sellers setting up shop at nice, round numbers. Think $20, $50, $100, etc. If a stock is making a miracle run from $10, and is approaching $20, you better believe there\u2019s going to be a large number of people looking to take profits at the $20 mark, and as a result, you should look to exit the position around there. Again, this isn\u2019t a 100% concrete theory, and sometimes these levels won\u2019t hold at all, but it\u2019s still something to keep in mind. More on this later.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Technical Caveats\n\n**Please note, that these technical exits won\u2019t hold true given that a company's underlying fundamentals have changed. A stock's technical charts and indicators are only to be used as a summary of a company's fundamentals.** Technicals summarize the price action which is driven by the underlying fundamentals. If the fundamentals of a company change, the technical indicators and charts will also change, thereby making our old technical charts void. This is an extremely important concept that most traders and investors do not fully understand. Technicals summarize fundamentals.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf $MSFT announces that they\u2019re coming out with a time machine, don\u2019t expect the stock's price to bounce off of the nearest overhead resistance, as that level is now void. $MSFT has fundamentally changed as a company, and as a result, the technicals will also need to change to reflect that. The same is true to the downside. If $MCD announces that they\u2019ve been grinding up humans and putting them into their hamburgers, don\u2019t expect the nearest level of support to hold - it\u2019s void. The stock will plunge into free fall until $MCD is properly priced given it\u2019s new fundamentals. Only then can we look to start re-establishing our technicals.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Technicals are only to be used as a summary of a company\u2019s current fundamentals.**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Psychological Exits\n\nPsychological exits consist of concepts and rules derived from how humans think and react to certain events. They are more conceptual in nature, and will vary from person to person. They aren\u2019t necessarily as concrete as the other types of exits due to their ambiguous nature. Everyone will apply these exits differently, and as a result I can\u2019t give you a consistent set of rules for each one. I can just explain the general concepts and provide different contexts regarding when to apply them. The rest is up to you!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Screenshot Theory\n\nThis is a very simple concept that I actually adopted from Wall Street Bets of all places - **If it\u2019s good enough to screenshot, it\u2019s good enough to sell.** If you\u2019re taking screenshots of your unrealized profits to flex on your friends, or random internet people, it\u2019s probably time to sell out of that position. The only reason you feel the need to flex your gains is because it\u2019s a life altering amount of money. I don\u2019t care what the fundamentals, or technicals say at that point. Cash out of the casino, and realize those gains. If it\u2019s good enough to screenshot, it\u2019s good enough to sell.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n# Individual Gain Theory\n\nThis concept refers to when you\u2019re trading with money that you cannot afford to lose, and you come in on somewhat of a win. Profit or loss, this money is going to fundamentally alter your life (for better or worse) because you were put in a position where you had to \u201ctrade\u201d money which you also needed elsewhere. If you\u2019re ever in a situation where you\u2019re forced to trade to make some extra dough, take those profits asap. A loss is often going to make your life a hell of a lot worse than a win will.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n# Exiting Around Whole Numbers\n\nHumans are weird creatures - we like \u201cwhole\u201d or \u201cround\u201d stuff, numbers being no exception. How often do you catch yourself submitting a buy order for 20$, or a sell order for $50. Unless you\u2019re cognizant of it, you\u2019re not going to think to yourself \u201cimma buy $CLF at 21.83\u201d. There\u2019s a good chance you\u2019re gonna round it up to $22, or down to $20, etc. The same goes for literally EVERYONE else. Just keep in mind that depending on the direction you\u2019re trading, there\u2019s often going to be buyers / sellers at whole numbers. $10, $20, $25, $30, etc. No number is safe. Look to time your exits before or after these numbers, as they may prove to be mini points of resistance. You\u2019ll often see sellers step in at whole numbers on the way up, and buyers step in at whole numbers on the way down. Use this to your advantage.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n# Emotional Exits\n\nThis concept applies to two key emotions - Euphoria and Hope. **The instant you start feeling euphoric about a trade and it\u2019s potential gains, step away from the trade.** You\u2019re not going to be thinking clearly enough to make an optimal trade or exit. There\u2019s a very high chance you\u2019re going to continue to chase the victory. If the victory starts slipping away from you, you're likely going to stay in the trade hoping that it goes back up to the previous high that you didn\u2019t sell at. In situations like this, by staying in the trade, you\u2019ll almost always hold your position well past the top, and will be prone to \u201cdiamond hands-ing\u201d your profits into the ground, ultimately coming up with a loss on a fundamentally sound trade. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nYou need to be conscious of the fact that you\u2019re euphoric, and that this trade went awesome, and exit the position intelligently. Once you start feeling euphoria, and consequently hope, there\u2019s no going back. You\u2019re not trading on fundamentals, and you\u2019re not trading on technicals either. You\u2019re simply not trading rationally. In situations like this, it\u2019s best to take a step back and exit the trade before you make a boneheaded move and end up giving your gains away. Emotions cloud judgement, and as traders, that\u2019s the last thing we want. Sell out of a position once you start feeling intense emotion.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Conclusion\n\nAll in all, options trading is a difficult game with many moving parts - If you're caught skimping on your exits, you\u2019re gonna be kneecapping your gains on a regular basis. This aspect of trading is less glamorous and often overlooked, but is absolutely vital to your success as a trader.
