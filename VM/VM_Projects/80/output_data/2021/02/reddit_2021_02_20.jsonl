Also, I think a big part of what made Netflix so great before was the algorithm they used to make suggestions based on your ratings, I don\u2019t know what they changed or when they did it but it seems like it might coincide with when they switched from the star-based ratings to a simple thumbs up/down rating.\n\nTheir pricing is very inflated for the experience IMO and I have seriously considered just cancelling it altogether lately. Amazon Prime Video and Hulu have been getting more of my watch-time lately and Prime is worth the cost just for the delivery benefits, the Music/Video/etc services make their subscription all the more valuable. Hulu is cheaper but their commercials playing at like 130% of the volume of the shows is super annoying.\n\nAnyway, I remember when Netflix recently announced their most recent subscription price increase that their stock responded very positively. I\u2019d be willing to bet the majority of their investors underestimated the competition and overestimated the quality of Netflix during that stock price rise. Unless something big changes I think they\u2019ll start to see subscription rates dip quite substantially, eventually into a net loss of subscribers.\n\nBUT! I don\u2019t want to underestimate the sticky effect of longtime subscription holders just taking a super long time to wake up and drop the service\u2014I still remember hearing stories of people renting their landline telephones from AT&T or one of the Bell companies (can\u2019t remember atm) for decades as recently as the late \u201890s or \u201800s just because they\u2019d never looked at their bill and didn\u2019t know they had other options\u2014they were simply too used to the monthly bill to even consider other options.

{"title": "Airbnb Earnings, an \"insiders\" take", "selftext": "Listen up!\n\nOr dont.\n\nAirbnb's earnings come out this week and they are projected to be -$9.17 EPS, not very good.  However, I have a strong belief that they are going to CRUSH the earnings estimate and have a very green end of the week.\n\nBut... Why?\n\nWell - besides spending far too much time here with you all, I also spend much of my time owning/managing 3 airbnb's in the Chicago area.  Annnnd I have a new one I purchased in Saugatuck, MI that I have been renovating to prepare for the spring/summer 2021.\n\nSurely this does not qualify me for anything?\n\nListen.\n\nBack in March/April 2020 when shit really started to hit the fan.  Basically ALL of our summer reservations for the Chicago units cancelled.  It was panic mode, literally cancellations left and right because of covid.  This is not news.\n\nAt the same time Airbnb was in panic mode, they trimmed 1,900 of 7,500 employees.  Oof.\n\nThen something miraculous happened.  We began getting bookings again for the summer.  Many more, and bookings were over double in the average length we normally get (read = more profitable). Very soon our entire summer was booked as normal with a new type of guest.  We were seeing many people who now had the freedom to work wherever they wanted travel to Chicago for weeks on end, rather than a weekend.  They would just work M-F and then explore when they wanted.  It was a new type of Work-Vacation? if you will.\n\nOur summer revenue was right on par with what we would consider a \"normal\" summer - truly remarkable given the circumstances.\n\nFast forward - I am living in Michigan prepping the new Airbnb.  I frequent the downtown area and chat up many of the shop owners to get a feel for the area and what the past summer was like as this is a major vacation destination.  In short, every shop owner reported the same thing.  Every weekend was like the 4th of July (typically the busiest weekend of all summer).  Basically all fo them reported that they saw record numbers of people and absolutely smashed their previous \"best months\" of sales and what not.  This trend has continued all the way through January 2021 I've heard, shops reporting record January sales.\n\nIn addition to this there is swaths of data showing the trending increase in short term rentals like Airbnb, VRBO, Home Away, etc.  and a trending decline in hotels.  I don't anticipate this trend changes anytime soon.\n\nSo. In summary.\n\nAirbnb anticipated the worst (as did I) and trimmed employees to cut major costs.\n\nWhat actually happened was a mini boom in short term rental demand as people sought alternatives vacations that did not require flying and people took advantage of remote work.\n\nAirbnb cut costs anticipating the worst, then saw comparable levels if not increased levels of business in many markets.\n\nI think Airbnb is going to crush earnings and am YOLO'ing the rest of my deteriorating account into calls expiring Friday.\n\nI do not work for Airbnb or anything, I am simply a friendly host who is overly confident in his ability to predict the future.\n\nI hope I don't get banned or get this removed cause I can't show my positions, but I had this epiphany today and obviously can't buy calls till Monday, but you can bet your wife's boyfriend's Tesla that that is what I'm doing.\n\nEdit - I'm in with 217.5 and 210 strikes expiring Friday.  Only 1 contract each, which is in fact all I can do with the money still in my account.
