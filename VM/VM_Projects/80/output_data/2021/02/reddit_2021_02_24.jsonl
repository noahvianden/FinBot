But his education began [here](https://i.imgur.com/thvwQRw.jpg).\n\nGraham was big on the concept of \"margin of safety\"... implicit in his thesis statement (which should be committed to memory):\n\n>An investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis, promises safety of principal and an adequate return.  Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative.\n\nAs Buffett notes in his preface to *The Intelligent Investor*, Graham did not consider speculation investing... and that's where I feel fairly confident I understand what Graham means by \"value\" because he was not looking at companies priced 44 or 30 or 20 or 10 times book, but 1.5 times book at most.\n\nHe went a step further, advocating that an investor grant himself a \"margin of safety\" below intrinsic value.  That is, if a company's intrinsic value of x, you would be wise to pay, let's say, 0.75x to give yourself a cushion in the event that your valuation is bloated.\n\nTo paraphrase Buffett, I'll never understand why some people want to pay a dollar for sixty cents rather than the other way around.  All else being equal, if we bought the same stock and I paid closer to fair value for it, my payday will always be bigger than yours.  And if your only answer is \"tech hasn't been at...\" then you're blinkered and awed by the bullshit of VC's and street analysts who have a vested interest in inflated valuations.\n\nRoger Lowenstein prefaces Part 1 of *Security Analysis*:\n\n>Coca-Cola's earnings were rising sharply in the early and mid-1990s, and the company's aggressively promotional CEO, Roberto Goizueta, was feted on the cover of *Fortune.* Goizueta was talented, but his talent was fully reflected in Coca-Cola's earnings, and the earnings were reflected in the price of the stock. Investors, however, went a further step, pushing the stock to a lofty 45 times earnings due to their faith in management to increase earnings. Graham and Dodd referred to this as \"double-counting\"\u2014that is, investors buy the stock on the basis of their faith in management and then, seeing that the stock has risen, take it as additional proof of management's powers and bid the stock up further.  In 1997, an analyst at Oppenheimer was so smitten by Goizueta, who died later that year, that he wrote Coca-Cola had \"absolute control over near term results.\"\n\nIf Graham's central argument is that you shouldn't be the fool who overpays, but the shrewd investor who sells to the fool who overpays, who am I to argue?", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6767891049385071}], "tickers": ["nvda"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Bro though out all this boring fundamentals and technical stuff that\u2019s not what is moving the market..ppl invest in companies they think it\u2019s trynna make the wrld a better place.. n nvidia would be 1 if the price was like $30", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "I'm not the person you replied to but your going to have a bad time if you think that sunshine and rainbows move the market.
