{"title": "Thoughts on copper as an inflation, infrastructure, green energy play?", "selftext": "I am bullish on copper, and I'd like a critique of my thesis.\n\nWhen  I used to work in the recording studio business back in 2007, 8, 9, it  was well known that most people trying to start studios fail MISERABLY.  There was always hype around a record label or some famous producer  opening their new studio, which would fail soon thereafter. They'd have  amazing platinum plaques and credentials, but when they start their own  place, they fail HORRIBLY. They often had more musical talent than  management/business talent and would faceplant. Also, when normal people  would see the success of one studio, they want to start their own and  reproduce it; who wouldn't want to make their living recording cool  music all day?\n\nI was talking to  someone who used to work at a place like sweetwater, one of those venues  that sells equipment to all of the wannabes. Something stuck with me  that I'll never forget.  They told me, \"you don't make money off the  dream of opening a studio. You make money \\*selling the dream of opening a  studio.\"\\* Sell the equipment. The fiberglass for panels. The preamps.  The console. The high end, tube U47 microphones. The setup of the  facility, all that jazz. Regardless of whether the studio does amazingly  well or fails entirely, you made your money. During a time of so many  people's home studio businesses recording people for cheap on craigslist  failing, so many professional studios failing, retailers of the  products necessary to set up said facility were doing amazing. Selling  the dream, generates more stable income than chasing the dream.\n\nLet's  transfer that analogy to new infrastructure plans, green energy  startups, solar/EV companies, wind energy companies, etc. There's going  to be an infrastructure plan regarding green energy coming out, unless  Biden was fibbing about a 2T plan to tackle climate change, which is  hard to believe with a Democratic house & senate. To try and guess  which companies that will benefit, when they will start making profit,  whether they will go tits up or do well, and whether they are currently  in a bubble, that's too much for my small brain. To try and \\*time\\* it -  is even harder. Is ICLN going back down to $18 because it's a bubble  before it goes to $30 when Biden begins his 2T plan, or is it going to  $100 before he announces it? What car company will do best? Is TSLA  overvalued at its humble 1500 PE and about to get spanked by some  surprise Ford or GM comes out with, or is TSLA going to make 10000 PE  the new norm by this time next year? Timing this and picking a company,  as well as when bubbles will burst, is impossible. I don't have the  brain for it.\n\nOne thing is for  sure - every single one of them, will need copper. Copper is an  excellent conductor. Low resistance, low oxidation, cheap. It doesn't  \\*matter\\* whether the  company makes billions, or goes tits up. It  doesn't \\*matter\\* if a specific solar panel company makes great panels  and sells record numbers, or shit panels that all get recalled. In order  for them to even get started living the dream, someone needs to sell  them the commodities necessary to get started. Before they create, much  less sell, a single marketable product, they have to buy the copper.\n\nWe  combine this with another tailwind, the US dollar going to shit. The  dollar appears to be getting obilterated. Stimulus is going everywhere,  federal reserve balance sheet is exploding with seemingly no end in  sight. Inflation occurs as a result of two things - adding more to the  money supply, and a drop in production of goods/services. If huge swaths  of entire industries/jobs are considered \"not essential\" by politicians  for extended periods of time, you have a loss in production. If people  get sick and cannot produce as a result, you have a loss of production.  and if you have seemingly endless QE, money printer go brrr means more  money everywhere - to buy up a limited number of goods and services. The  result, is inflation.\n\nI am seeing  copper as a green energy + inflation play that is less risky than  speculating on any one particular company or fund. As someone who  believes inflation will get worse, and that green energy is the future, I  think copper is a bullish play. I am not quite sure the best way to  take advantage of this, if this is the case. I'm more sharing this to  get criticism & ideas from others than to actually give advice. I  own shares of a few copper ETFs right now and some ICLN, at the time of  this posting, and am not trying to give advice, but rather find holes in  my thesis so I can make better investment decisions.\n\n**TL;DR;  My theory is that there is a triple decker event that will cause copper  to soar more than it has, and continue soaring.

You make more money but your mortgage stays the same, taking up less of your income. It helps anyone with any kind of debt because it lowers the value of that debt, which is held by the bankers. So you got that 30 year mortgage on your 3 bedroom ranch with a basement in Missouri for $200k about 10 years ago. You\u2019ve been a good little borrower and have made all your payments on time, sometimes even rounded up to the nearest hundie to keep book keeping simple.

That can be a good option too.  \n  \nLook, let me put it this way... 40 years ago, my mom bought the house she raised me in in East Missouri for about $30k-35k. Her mortgage payment was under $350/month like forever until she paid it off. That was 10 years ago. She did a refi at one point and the equity was enough to pay more than twice the rest of the original mortgage. They took that second to pay the first, then still owed the same amount plus extra from equity (they didn\u2019t take the full equity but I\u2019m not exactly sure how much). They had a ton of spending cash, they had a way better rate, their payment was the same ,while they both were making twice as much by this time, & their property value continued to go up.
