{"title": "GME moving forward", "selftext": "I have asperger's, like Burry, and I believe there is more to this market activity than WSB's actions, we are in the final phases of a 120 year debt/technology cycle that was due to end in 2012, but was extended by monetary malfeasance. This is the final bubble before the depression. The last cycle complete at the end of the long depression. The reason why stocks like tesla, gamestop, and chipotle have run up so much is because of the bubble. And for this reason I do not believe it is done yet. The bubble should pop on july 14th, until then, I am long gamestop, bought in today in fact, and while it may drop more, I do believe on monday the stock will soar. It's a risk, but one i'm willing to take. Rather than options, i bought the shares.
