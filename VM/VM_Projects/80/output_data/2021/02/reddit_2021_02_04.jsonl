{"title": "Let\u2019s talk about SUNPOWER (SPWR)", "selftext": "I have been looking for a long term hold and I think I found it: Sunpower (SPWR)\n\nSunpower is one of the leading Solar installation/manufacturing/battery storage companies in the \nhugely growing industry. Thank old Joe!\n\nJust google \u201ctop solar companies\u201d and tell me which have the best product and best customer ratings.\n\nSunpower is currently at a peak of a year long run up and now is nearly 60% available shares shorted. \n\nWhat most people don\u2019t know, is, that Sunpower has started to roll out a new product that will consume market share from everyone\u2019s favorite, Tesla. The product is called SunVault. SunVault is an energy storage battery that very well competes and rivals the Tesla power wall. I believe that SunVault will sell extremely well and could bring Sunpower up to Tesla levels in terms of solar and energy storage. The product is capable of powering your home for nearly 3 days. And when combined with the high efficiency panels that Sunpower offers, it\u2019s game changing. \n\nSunVault only started rolling out last summer and Solar doesn\u2019t really pick up till the summer. So getting in now before the busy season may be advantageous.\n\nIf you are looking for a company that is fundamentally strong and has a high upside in a huge market, SPWR really could be something to consider.\n\nthis is not investment advice.

Combine this with an eventual movement towards non-carbon power.\n\nSo I went out and bought the solar ETF \\`TAN\\`, but then I also made a number of individual purchases such as SPWR. They were all flat for the first few years, but now they are all taking off, SPWR probably most of all. And the rate of improvement of solar seems to be continuing on the trend and not slowing.

{"title": "Canoo (GOEV)", "selftext": "Ok here is my first shot at a DD. I've been eyeing this company Canoo (GOEV) for a little while. I'm long 1200 shares @ a cost of $15.28\n\n[https://www.canoo.com/](https://www.canoo.com/)\n\nCanoo is a new EV start-up that plans to have a vehicle subscription service. From their investor presentation, it looks like they estimate $90,000 revenue on a car over 12 years. That means the cost per month for their subscription model is $625 per month, all in, no down payment, no insurance cost, they take care of maintenance, etc.\n\nLink:\u00a0[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1750153/000121390020022608/ea125677ex99-2\\_hennessy.htm?fbclid=IwAR2as\\_F2t-ZrmXWjKGvDLROdeSmL5ByctPw3W0VuqEcOHYjZggG3d5FX4T4](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1750153/000121390020022608/ea125677ex99-2_hennessy.htm?fbclid=IwAR2as_F2t-ZrmXWjKGvDLROdeSmL5ByctPw3W0VuqEcOHYjZggG3d5FX4T4)\n\nNow, I know that seems a bit expensive but it seems that $625/mon is cheaper than the low end of the average of owning a gas-powered car at $750-916/mon. It has a barrier-of-entry because there is no down payment. I don't know how that will play out with most people. I personally like owning my own vehicle, but it could be popular with younger people because again, they wouldn't need to worry about any maintenance or insurance. Now, I do think their subscription model would be very popular among large companies that need a cheap, low-maintenance fleet of vehicles. I hope they're trying to land a contract with a company like UPS or FedEx.\n\nWhat I like most about this company is their \"skateboard\" platform which is the bottom half of the car. From my understanding, they would just need to crash test one of each skateboard. Any vehicle, regardless of the configuration, would also have that crash rating, which is an amazing cost saving when they can sell a bunch of units to a larger car manufacture, like Hyundai, with whom they already have a partnership.\n\nLink:\u00a0[https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21133461/hyundai-canoo-electric-cars-partership-kia](https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21133461/hyundai-canoo-electric-cars-partership-kia)  \n\n\nIt is reported that Apple tried to buy Canoo in 2020 but Canoo turned them down. Apple has apparently partnered with Hyundai to enter the EV-space, I think because Apple really liked Canoo's customizable platform.

They\u2019re **expecting 37% growth** this year.\n\nSo why did they drop from their ER? Well, it was because of next-gen chip shortages through the first half of 2021. But let\u2019s be real here, this is a joke compared to the issues Intel is facing with their next-gen.\n\nObviously, we\u2019d prefer if they never had a shortage, but I mean if you\u2019re gonna have a problem it might as well be this one. This news is LITERALLY SAYING, \u201chey we have too many orders and we can\u2019t keep up sorry, we\u2019ll get it to you ASAP\u201d\n\nImagine thinking this company isn\u2019t going to bounce back and go to new ATH in the next month or two.\n\nOur queen, Lisa Su, said \u201cthere will be added capacity\u201d in the second half of the year. This is perfect, because that means by the time next holiday season comes around they\u2019ll be good to go. I wouldn\u2019t worry about these shortages. They are running at full capacity and we should expect their sales to increase throughout the year.\n\n**Some loser (**u/aatop**) decided to call out Market Share issues in my last post so here's a section just for him:**\n\nIntel gained back 0.7% of market share in Q4 across the CPU market as a whole. Whoop de doo!\n\n**In the last month ALONE, AMD gained back 3%.** Here's a little business lesson. Ups and downs happen. No growth company is going to have growth every single month/quarter. I don't care who they are. There are hiccups. Don't let some negative nancys make you believe that a hiccup means AMD's market growth is ending.\n\n**AMD actually GAINED on Intel in the CPU server secto**r. What does that tell you? That **boomers are actually converting to AMD** for their company. And we all know that these boomer companies have all the money for now.\n\n# Technicals:\n\nFor those of you who care about lines on a chart, I got you as well.\n\nWe really have two things to look out for. We have a resistance (that used to be a strong support) at 88. But we\u2019re basically there right now.\n\nIn addition, the last few weeks before ER, we were in that 89-97 channel. What does that mean? Well, once we get going here **AMD will shoot up to $97 and from there we can retest ATH.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/49t9dzxqghf61.png?width=1988&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a45e5768cdd5fad74cfa67b2544f46065135d47\n\nFor more squiggly lines, the MACD is about to cross the signal line so we could see some bullish sentiment here. And of course the RSI is near the bottom of the range, but honestly who cares about that anyway.\n\n# Conclusion/TLDR:\n\nMy point is that more than half of you fuckers run AMD in your machine anyway and the other half is waiting for their stimulus check to buy the new Ryzen series. The new investors here are all sad from GME, but now it\u2019s time to put your big boy pants on and get into something that has some real value behind it. You got questions? Leave em in the comments and I\u2019ll answer.\n\n**Positions: 4/16/2021 100c, 97.5c \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80**\n\nThis is not financial advice.
