{"title": "(2/8) Monday's Pre-Market Stock Movers & News", "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/StockMarket sub! Welcome to the new trading week! Here are your pre-market stock movers & news on this Monday-\n\n*****\n\n# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Monday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/08/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-february-8-2021.html)\n\n*****\n\n> # 1. Wall Street set to rise after best week since November\n\n> * Dow futures pointed to an over 100 points gain at Monday\u2019s open, an advance that would exceed the 30-stock average\u2019s closing record and could top its intraday all-time high, both of which happened last month. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq on Friday closed at record highs, while the Dow\u2019s gain was about 40 points shy of a closing record as a disappointing January jobs report boosted hopes for further economic stimulus to help Americans and U.S. businesses during the pandemic. All three stock benchmarks logged their best weeks since November. The Reddit-fueled trading frenzy around short-squeeze names receded as shares of GameStop lost 70% last week, even with Friday\u2019s 19% gain. The previous week, the video game retailer\u2019s stock soared 400%. Shares rose 12% in Monday\u2019s premarket trading.\n\n*****\n\n> # 2. Tesla invests $1.5 billion in bitcoin, which soared to all-time high\n\n> * Tesla, in a SEC filing, said the electric auto maker has purchased $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin after changing its investment policy last month. Bitcoin soared over $43,000 in an all-time high Monday. The Tesla filing also said, \u201cWe expect to begin accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for our products in the near future, subject to applicable laws and initially on a limited basis, which we may or may not liquidate upon receipt.\u201d Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been talking up bitcoin and dogecoin, another cryptocurency, in recent tweets. Shares of Tesla rose in Monday\u2019s premarket trading.\n\n*****\n\n> # 3. Yellen says Biden stimulus could result in full employment next year\n\n> * The U.S. economy could return to full employment in 2022 if President Joe Biden\u2019s $1.9 trillion coronavirus rescue package were passed, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Sunday. Long-term unemployment is around a historical peak. While Biden has said he wants to get GOP support for his Covid relief measure, Democrats are taking steps toward passing his approach without any Republican votes. Republicans have opposed the $1.9 trillion price tag and called for lowering the income cap for receiving the full $1,400 direct payment.\n\n*****\n\n> # 4. Trump impeachment trial starts this week\n\n> * Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey, one of Donald Trump\u2019s harshest Republican critics in the wake of the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, said Sunday he sees a conviction of the former president at his impeachment trial as \u201cvery unlikely.\u201d Trump\u2019s unprecedented second Senate impeachment trial will start on Tuesday. With a 50-50 split in the Senate, it would take 17 Republicans voting with every Democrat to convict. If Senate does so, it could also vote to bar Trump from holding office again or getting certain perks reserved for former presidents.\n\n*****\n\n> # 5. South Africa suspends plans to use AstraZeneca\u2019s Covid-19 vaccine\n\n> * South Africa has suspended plans to inoculate its frontline health care workers with AstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine after a small clinical trial suggested it was not effective in preventing mild to moderate illness from the variant dominant in that country. The disappointing early results from the study, which has yet to be peer-reviewed, indicated that giving the AstraZeneca vaccine may not be useful in South Africa. In the U.S., AstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine has not been approved. Only vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna have been approved for emergency use so far by the FDA.
