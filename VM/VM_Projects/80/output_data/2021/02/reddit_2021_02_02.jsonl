Everyday, RobinHood has to submit a 'ledger' to a clearing house, listing all the stocks bought and sold that day. Since the clearing house settles the orders, they need to post a fractional cash deposit, or collateral so that their customers can be paid back.\n\n\n\n>Trades have T+2 (2 days) to settle (cash for the security). Within that time, **the clearing house demands a cash deposit from RH so that they are ensured that they have the cash to settle the trades**. Until the traders (in 2 days time) pay, this forces RH to put their own cash on the line to pay or to be paid the net cash difference. This period exposes RH to credit risk. **This is called a clearing deposit**. The more volatile the stock is, the more money RH has to post as a cash deposit, thus overall increasing the total amount needed for the cash deposit.\n\n\n>The high order volume forced RH to place larger and larger cash deposits in the clearinghouse. GME was also incredibly volatile over the last few days, further increasing the amount they needed to post. **They can't use client money, they have to use their own money and RobinHood doesn't have a large cash position**. They simply ran out of liquidity to further process orders, even after drawing on credit lines to meet the surge in demand. \n\n\n>**RH had to halt and limit buy orders on GME so that they could meet the financial regulations imposed by Dodd - Frank.**\n\n\n>To everyone's disappointment, this isn't a noble 'uprising' against evil traders in Wall street, it's a gigantic misunderstanding of how the financial system operates. A cabal of evil bankers don't sit in a board room in Goldman Sachs planning how to screw over the entire country for fun everyday.

{"title": "$BB DD - NO MEEMS - PART 2", "selftext": "TOday I did research to calm myself down after pounding a redbull and getting triggered by all the misinformation and greedy nitwits that have flooded this site looking for a quick flip.\n\nImagine you\u2019re John Chen. Sauntering down the hallway, with your 50 pound dick grazing the velveteen carpet with each step. You hear the guttural screams coming out of sales. You walk by the engineers, and gaze upon the latest widget as they kowtow before your bespecled grandeur. You hear about the customers who sing your praises, and the (much fewer) ones who tell you your product sucks donkey balls... But we (the retards @ WSB or frankly the dubmasses @ seeking alpha and even JP Morgan equity coverage) don\u2019t know the details any of this, only dry ass reports that come out every quarter.\n\nSo, other than hacking into John\u2019s brain (not recommended), what can we do? We can suckle at the teat of Twitter announcements, and sometimes that\u2019s fun but usually it\u2019s PR driven (unless it comes from Papa Chen\u2019s account in which case suckle away).\n\nBut boy oh boy wouldn\u2019t it be great if we could know the things P. Chiddy does. What new things are in development. Big new sales in the pipeline. Whether the company is hiring (or shrinking), and in what areas\u2026.Wait. For the last thing we actually can!\n\nthanks to the grotesquely fat (and very rich, no offense Gabe) founder of a soul-crushing professional network called LinkedIn. Linkedin, very kindly, takes employment related info from companies and displays it for all the world including competitors of those companies and bored autists like me. So let\u2019s see - What Can headcount trends @ $BB tell us about the company?\n\nTo start, I took a look at Job Postings / Total Headcount. If you\u2019re a shrinking company, this should be a low number. If you\u2019re growing, it stands to reason this % would be higher. No company deliberately hires people they don\u2019t think they need, and last time I checked $BB\u2019s CFO wasn\u2019t completely retarded. Now, it\u2019s important not to read too much into this, but as a general matter companies that are growing have high stock prices (b/c they\u2019re growing, duh) and vice versa.\n\nFANG isn\u2019t a perfect comp (I\u2019ll get to the others in a sec), but **serves as a good proxy of a \u201cbaseline growthy\u201d tech.** No super saiyan rocketships at this point, but nobody is accusing $AAPL of shrinking. See below.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1g1ubpfxize61.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=58d58b12644e9688e15e35e907386b910b9d938d\n\n# IMPLICATION NUMBER #1 - $$BB COMPARES FAVORABLY TO FANG IN TERMS OF HEADCOUNT-IMPLIED GROWTH. IF YOU SAID \u201c$BB IS HIRING MORE RELATIVE TO ITS SIZE THAN THE AVERAGE FANG\u201d, PEOPLE WOULD LAUGH AND THROW BANANAS AT YOU, BUT YOU\u2019D BE RIGHT!!\n\n\u201cBut wait,\u201d you say. \u201cgrowthinvestor123 you fucking idiot, [didn\u2019t you just compare $BB to CRWD, ZS, SAIL, and PANW](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lamg0y/bb_dd_no_meems_part_1/) to justify a **$60 / share** price target for $BB? I want to see the ratios for those.\u201d Ok you, got me. See below, headcount-implied growth is higher for endpoint security comparables.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eaz3begzize61.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=d01221903b3c50a6838710f32daa173035eb9e92\n\n\u201cHah,\u201d you say smugly. \u201cThose other endpoint security businesses blow $BB out of the water, $BB sucks\u201d.\n\nNo, you fucking idiot. If a simple headcount ratio without context was all it took I\u2019d be rich instead of handsome like mommy tells me.\n\n$BB went through [**round**](https://channeldailynews.com/news/layoffs-hit-blackberry-in-waterloo/28015) after [**round**](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=blackberry+layoffs&atb=v224-1&ia=web&iai=r1-3&page=1&sexp=%7B%22cdrexp%22%3A%22b%22%2C%22artexp%22%3A%22b%22%2C%22prodexp%22%3A%22b%22%2C%22prdsdexp%22%3A%22c%22%2C%22biaexp%22%3A%22b%22%2C%22msvrtexp%22%3A%22b%22%7D) of painful layoffs as it shifted from being a handset business to what it is today. Despite what the trust fund communists on this site would want you to think, firing people is never easy, and a lot harder than even hiring them. No manager wants to see his team shrunk,and no CEO wants to be painted as a chainsaw wielding asshole. $$ BB has a **history**, and that is a blessing and a curse.\n\n**Remember**, Daddy chen\u2019s primary focus for the past almost-decade has been driving a turnaround. The handset team? Gone. Money-losing International operations? Gone. But the smart monkes and useful apes who might be able to do more than throw feces at each other??? And these smart monkes who were retained \u2013 Well, no need to make a job posting for that role anymore, right?\n\n# IMPLICATION #2 \u2013 BLACKBERRY HAD > 20K EMPLOYEES. UNTIL RECENTLY THE COMPANY HAS BEEN CUTTING, NOT GROWING, AND ONE OF THE FEW BENEFITS OF ITS PAST SHITTY HISTORY IS THAT THE COMPANY CAN NOW GROW VS. HAVING TO FIND NEW EMPLOYEES QUICKLY LIKE CERTAIN COMPETITORS\n\nThis brings me to the final part of our headcount analysis. Let\u2019s look at those endpoint security comparables again. Headcount is one thing, but of the quality of that headcount? Let\u2019s look at two two non-retard quotes \u2013\n\n***\"I have my own theory about why the decline happens at companies like IBM or Microsoft. The company does a great job, innovates and becomes a monopoly or close to it in some field, and then the quality of the product becomes less important. The product starts valuing the great salesmen, because they're the ones who can move the needle on revenues, not the product engineers and designers. So the salespeople end up running the company.\" Steve Jobs***\n\n***\u201cIf your product requires advertising or salespeople to sell it, it\u2019s not good enough: technology is primarily about product development, not distribution.\u201d Peter Thiel***\n\nI was curious and did comparison of the ratio of $BB\u2019s Engineering / IT monkeys to its sales. See below\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6nog6m62jze61.png?width=524&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb26266cbef428abb3152f1b9077c1a0daee07b0\n\nEven as a $BB bull, I didn\u2019t expect the discrepancy to be so large.\n\n# IMPLICATION #3 \u2013 BLACKBERRY ACTUALLY IS MORE OF AN ENGINEERING / IT FOCUSED COMPANY RELATIVE TO ITS PEERS.

{"title": "Why eBay is going to roll on their earnings", "selftext": "By roll on, I mean knock out of the fucking park.\n\n\nHere\u2019s some DD for anybody who doesn\u2019t eat breath and sleep only GME.\n\n\neBay, like most other online retailers, are going to have ludicrous numbers in this last quarter due to the holiday season. That\u2019s just a given. \n\n\nI am an experienced eBay seller who on a weekly basis for the last few years, sells around 15-20 items. The last few months was ridiculous. Items which were posted that would have around 10 bids and 5-15 watchers, would have 25-30 with 20+ bids. The views on each item was double to tripe from early November until pretty much the last two weeks. \n\n\nLots of volume, lots of selling, lots of 10% commissions for eBay. Now we all saw what happened with Apple, posting 100+ Billion in revenue this last earnings report and being down 3% the next day. That shit happens, I\u2019m not a psychic with a magic ball. If the market is tanking, the market is tanking. Look at it this week. But I will say this, the volume on eBay isn\u2019t why I\u2019m going fucking hard in the calls. Here\u2019s the real cherry on top:\n\neBay has now finally implemented a payment policy they have been working on for a long time. Every single one of my sales went through PayPal, along with everybody else. Every single god damn transaction PayPal got their dirty little claws into. Since I think like the beginning of eBay, it\u2019s just been a given that they give PayPal millions of dollars every month to run their transactions.\n\n\nWell guess what you mother fucker. Shit had changed. Since they have now implemented their STRAIGHT TO BANK ACCOUNT POLICY, PayPal doesn\u2019t even exist. The money goes, you guessed it, straight to your account. They even have their own return feature which they deal with themselves now, instead of putting funds into hold on PayPal. eBay allows you to chose when you get paid and in what frequency. For example, I have mine setup for each Tuesday of every week. \n\nThis is going to and has already saved them MILLIONS in fees. Papa Musk has already moved on from PayPal, it\u2019s time we do the same.\n\n\nOh, did I mention all the new payment platforms introduced as well? I bought a Pok\u00e9mon card the other day without gay as shit PayPal but through god damn Apple Pay. It was way too easy. You can also link credit cards, bank accounts, whatever. It\u2019s 2021.\n\n\neBay posts earnings in a few days, Wednesday after close. Do what you want. If the stock goes down, call me a retard and make fun of me. If the stock goes up, fuck off and thank me later. Look at what it did today. I\u2019ll probably sell a third of my calls on Wednesday for an IV hedge as well.

{"title": "Man up! Taken from other dude", "selftext": "\nMacadelicious\n58m\n(sorry to hijack top comment)\n\nTo everyone who is panicking, the following words are for you:\n\nAll of us have been feeling the ups and downs of this ride and, to be honest, don't forget where it all started and how far we've come. And by 'we' I mean the people who like this stock.\n\nBig hit today, right at the opening. Following this, I had the urge to open reddit and post for the 1st time to make it all clear for you, who obviously feel the doubt about the strategy. Don't feel bad about it, it's normal. You're stading against powerful people who want what we have and will do anything to get it -- starting, as we see, by lowering the prices and targeting stop losses (that you should've canceled already by this time).\n\nBut, just in time of Mark's Cuban AMA, I will spoil the message in his own words:\n\n\u00abIf you can afford to hold the stock, you hold. I dont own it, but thats what i would do.\u00bb\nThis is the message, this is what I want to say to every single of you retards who are in doubt. It's not all fun and games. Some suits are fighting not to lose billions. We, the people, are disrupting the market. You thought it would be easy?\n\nThey are doing everything they can to get those shares in your pocket, that's the only way to cover their naked ass. When people have been saying to HOLD this is precisely what they fucking meant. TO FUCKING HOLD. THIS IS THE MOTHERFUCKING BATTLE. PEOPLE DON'T SPAM IT JUST BECAUSE IT'S COOL TO HOLD. NO, IF YOU WANT THOSE FUCKING TENDIES YOU CAN'T LET SOME WALL STREET CORRUPT TRASH PARASITE TO COME AND TAKE IT FROM YOUR HANDS. THEY ARE THE ONES WHO GOT CAUGHT HOLDING THEIR PANTS. YOU DON'T HAVE TO FEEL AFRAID AND SELL. THEY ARE THE ONES WHO SHOULD - AND ARE - FUCKING DESPERATE.\n\nYou genuinely think that if they weren't scared all of this circus would've happen?\n\nHold your shares, and, if you can, buy some more. Volume is low, price is in discount. We still have the cheese in our hands. Plus (and correct me if I'm wrong because, you know, I'm a retard as well) they still have contracts to cover. I'm confident we might see the price to rise again today. But even if it doesn't, who cares? You don't pay interests to cover, patience is key. Citing Cuban again (damn it feels good): \u00abPatience. Disruption is never easy or straight line\u00bb.\n\nGuys, one last word: this is the epic journey people have been speaking for months. It's starting to spike (remember VW chart, i.e.). Today we are experiencing one of their last attempts to buy shares from the ones who panicked. This is why people keep yelling to HOLD! This is why you should not invest with money you might need, because you don't know how much time you'll have to HOLD! This is why you have to know your risk tolerance, to FUCKING KEEP HOLDING.\n\nJUST TAKE A LOOK TO THE MESIAH IT SELF, DO YOU SEE DEEP FUCKING VALUE SELLING?\n\nMAN UP BOYS, AND KEEP HOLDING THE FUCKING LINE\n\nPosition: 15 shares supported by Europoor\n\n(someone post this, please.

At this point, he's either bluffing or truly not concerned.\n\n**Why would he bluff?**\n\n1. This blew up (culturally/frenzy), hedgies got out of this using the dirtiest of tricks that even he didn't see in the middle of all the hype-buying, it squoze out from under us mixed in with all the hype and tricks, and he doesn't see it yet.\n\n2. This blew up, and saw the squeeze, and still held out of principle (in this case he wouldn't be bluffing technically, just wouldn't have the goal of maximizing gains, which I assume is his goal).\n\n3. He sees it (now) but missed his exit and is doubling down because FUCK and why not / who knows / embarrassed etc.\n\nNone of those options really make any sense to me coming from the guy who called this so brilliantly a long time ago. If you have other theories on why his tweet today might have been a bluff, please comment.\n\n**Why isn't he concerned**\n\n1. He doesn't think the new squeeze data isn't right, shorts are still short and he doesn't buy the S3 update.\n\n2. He has a pre-defined exit strategy no matter what happens that hasn't triggered yet.\n\n3. He isn't planning on selling, ever. \n\n*or*\n\n4. His stoic ass did not get caught up in the frenzy at all. He saw the hype building, he realized that this might blow up to hundreds of dollars on that hype, come back down, and life would go on. Even if GME goes back down to $40-60 we are still up for the month. If a squeeze is still on the table, this frenzy we are going through really won't matter that much if we are looking at this in terms of months at a time. Dude is clearly patient af, maybe he proactively embraced emotionally for this violent roller coaster that nobody truly expected, and scheduled today's tweet a week ago knowing it would likely crash back to earth and still settle at a very good price relative to where its been. \n\nThese are just some random ideas, but I am really curious about this.
