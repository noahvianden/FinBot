{"title": "Pinterest is your express ticket to the moon in 2021. Let me explain.", "selftext": "Hi there. first time posting any DD on here. Please keep your insults gentle. TLDR at the bottom. (play monthly calls at the money and reap benefits)\n\nPinterest recently jumped due to a strong Q4 ER. Here's what they stated about their 2020\n\n>The company stated that there has been a **35% year-over-year increase in the number of monthly boards created**, including a 44% increase in beauty, a 95% increase in women's fashion and a 36% increase in home decor categories.\n\nLiterally, the entire report is a bull's wet dream. Seriously, just read this yourself. https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/pinterest-pins-to-report-q4-earnings%3A-whats-in-store-2021-02-02\n\nRather than making this post a cliff notes of that let me tell you briefly in my own words why PINS is going to go bananas. \n\n1) PINS advertisements hide in plain site.\n\nI recommend creating a profile quickly, w/o ad blocker, and give a quick scroll on your home page, or search for something you might think about purchasing or doing later. I think you'll be surprised at how many ads are in your results but also how well they blend in. **why does this matter**\n\n2) this means better conversion rates.\n\nConversion rates are how advertisers can tell if their ROI is worth it to advertise on a platform. PINS conversion rates are no doubt excellent (we don't have data on this bc it varies from brand to brand) and will continue to be because of the large amount of data they have (they are a god damn search engine, after all. you may have heard of other search engines with excellent ad targeting)\n\n3) PINS is apolitical\n\nthis is an advertisers (and users, honestly) wet dream. PINS isn't banning politicians on their platform, and youre only exposed to the political BS you CHOOSE to see. \n\n\n4) they have a **GROWTH** mindset\n\nthey're not dumb, they understand what makes them money. more active users, more money being spent on the platform in SOME fashion.\n\nto do this, they are dedicated on increasing their MAU (monthly active users) which has already increased 35% as stated above. They're also expanding much faster internationally, for whats it worth. (so if you have bias against the platform because you or nobody you know is on it, think bigger than that.)\n\nthey've also begun collaborating with Shopify, which still has a ton of potential in already very smooth shopping experience. (try to replicate a shopping experience on PINS, you will be surprised at how it acts like amazon in this sense offering you different suppliers and options from varying sources)\n\nPINS is just different, and their executives eyes are on the prize. I'm a believer in their goals to increase the bottom lines that will increase their revenue, and I'm all in.\n\nPS - did I mention Cathie Wood is holding a large stake of PINS in her ARKF fund? She holds over 2 million shares in her ETF, making up 3.65% of the fund. https://ark-funds.com/fintech-etf\n\ninformation on the Shopify partnership https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/post/pinterest-launches-shopify-app-for-easy-merchant-access-to-catalogs\n\nPinterest Is Unique Among The Social Media Giants\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/pinterest-unique-among-social-media-211705148.html\n\n> Brian Feroldi: The way I think about Pinterest evaluation is this. The ARPU [average revenue per user] number is the most exciting thing. I think Pinterest can at least 5X its average revenue per user, like at least.\n> \n> Brian Withers: That would be half of Facebook.\n> \n> Brian Feroldi: Yeah. It would still be [only] half of Facebook. How many users could this platform get? It just added 120 million in the last year. So they're at just under half a billion. Could they get to a billion? Facebook has three billion. Could Pinterest be one-third as popular as Facebook?\n> \n> If you can buy that argument, could they double their user base and 5X their average revenue per user? That will be a 10X growth in revenue. Is that realistic? I don't think it's out of the realm of possibility.\n> \n> Pinterest is a $50 billion [market cap] company. How about this for a comparison? Snapchat, 91 billion. Which platform do you think is more monetizable? Which platform do you think is more niche? If Snapchat is worth 90 billion, I think Pinterest is worth at least 200 billion.\n> \n> Brian Withers: As they grow that revenue, that's significantly scalable. They're going to drop more to the bottom line.\n> \n> Brian Feroldi: Their gross margin is 82 percent and rising.\n> \n> Brian Withers: Yeah, already.\n> \n> Brian Feroldi: So, bullish. [laughs]\n> \n> Brian Withers: I couldn't tell, Brian, I'm glad you clarified that.\n\nThere is so much information out there to confirm the Bull Bias on PINS that it keeps me up at night. I tell everybody I know about this stock. Assuming this takes off it's probably going to Dox me to many I know.\n\nTLDR - PINS is generating stupid cash from advertisers (for being a great search engine and place to shop) because they are increasing their user base at a strong healthy rate, and are dedicating to making sure the train doesnt stop.\n\nPositions:\n\n85c 3/19\n\n90c 4/16\n\n120c 1/21/22\n\n\n50 Shares at $80\n\n\ud83d\ude80 \ud83c\udf1d \ud83d\udccc \n\ni like the stock.
