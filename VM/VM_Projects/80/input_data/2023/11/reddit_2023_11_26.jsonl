I bought in small chunks and held through the split and am up like 700% from my initial investment in 2017. NVidia is now much more diversified as a market leader in data centers and a host of other things. They own something like 80% of the market for AI chips and while other companies like AMD, Microsoft, Intel, etc. are getting into the AI chip game, they are way behind the power curve. If you think AI is the next dot com bubble then you should probably avoid NVidia like the plague. For me, I trust companies to be as greedy as possible and always seek a competitive advantage, and AI helps them do just that. My primary concerns with NVidia are that they have significantly beat earnings expectations 3 or 4 quarters in a row now but in the last two quarters the stock has not really generated significant break outs from the previous quarter like we've come to expect with companies like Tesla (which had a P/E of 1396 at it's highest by the way). If they do not continue to significantly beat projections, or even miss, the stock price is going to suffer greatly. Recent policy decisions by the Biden administration cuts China off from purchasing their AI chips. For now they have a back log of customers they can shift to but they've already invested in tripling their manufacturing capability so once that comes online if they don't have a host of new customers, the chip glut will crash the price of the chips.
