Their value will adjust and climb year ofveryear until maturity where the loss is zero.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nVery much incorrect. No bond is worthless unless its issuer defaults on the debt.\n\nWhat happens is that the value of a bond falls on the open market but you dont have to sell. It is garantued that the closer the bond comes to maturity, the lower the \"loss\". In the end, you will get exacly what you paid for: a in your example a bond that is yielding 1% per year until maturity, where you receive your initial investment back.\n\nThe LOSS you are talking about is purely opportunistic aka if you didnt buy the 1% bond but waited until bonds paid 6% and then bought the bond, you could have made more money. But you NEVER lose money on a bond purchase IF you hold to maturity and the issuer does not default. Ofc, we talk about the nominal value, not the inflation-adjusted value.\n\nThe problem that was caused at SVB for example was that when you HAVE TO sell the bond before maturity due to liquidity issues, you do suffer a loss. At SVB, the bonds on their books lost more value than the bank had equity. Initially, no problem. But the market realized and a bank run occured. And how does a modern day bank run look like? Everyone is going into their online accounts via smartphones and moves and draws their money, pretty instantly and simultaneously.  \nAnd now they had to liquidite bonds below face value to make up for it. Which caused even more people to draw their money.
