{"title": "Fisker (FSR) YOLO Update - 11/13/2023", "selftext": "Original YOLO Post: [Click Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/15hszd4/fsr_my_ultimate_regard_yolo_dd/)\n\nAlright boys, it's me again. As promised, I have an update for you. Included in the update is an INCREASE in my position.\n\nAll of my prior DD still stands, especially:\n\n* Tesla is king, and will always be the f\\*\\*king king (glory to the TSLA bulls)\n* Smart \"asset light\" business model using Magna (who owns a stake in FSR so they can collaborate on pricing power) - instead of Fisker wasting their time building misaligned shit and hoping no one notices\n\nI'm down 37% since my last post. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h6w2zwcvr50c1.png?width=741&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea105a1f7e9ca95fe3d10325c55f5a4bfebf0620\n\nSo why do I insist on continuing to bend over for my wife's boyfriend? Instead of using my remaining $100K for something productive like wiping my ass with Benjamin Franklin's face every day, I did my homework for the first time since 6th grade:\n\n* **I bought a Fisker car** \\- I spent $70K+ (using the other half of my life savings) buying my own Fisker car to see for myself if it is any good. And let me tell you, it is f\\*\\*king incredible. It looks good, drives smooth, and has tons of space/legroom for picking up...friends on the street. This pic was shot in the middle of a 300+ mile road trip during which I encountered no issues. Tons of people were noticing this car during the trip/stops.\n\n[F\\*\\*k, this car is beautiful](https://preview.redd.it/ol6s8tbqr50c1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=472b96dc51bf607bf9ae43bd7044fd1ac5940f37)\n\n* **Company is making meaningful money now** \\- in addition to shipping great cars, they have at least $70K+ of my own money, and likely in the hundreds of millions already (5000 limited edition reservation holders x $70K = $300M+ revenue...and last I had checked they had 60,000+ total reservation holders waiting on cars)\n* **Market cap of this company is only $1.36B** \\- such a low valuation on what I extrapolate to be hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue and potentially 5000+ cars per quarter?? Compare that to $15B for Rivian with 10,000+ cars per quarter and $9B for Lucid with 2500+ cars per quarter.\n* **Reviewers still love this car** \\- the professional and amateur reviews I'm seeing are all still positive. Still no recalls or widespread major issues that I have heard of.\n* **Henrik Fisker hate/haters and lame criticism** \\- so many haters on this guy. I hate him too, he's a piece of shit. But god damn the hate fuels this magnificent bastard as it does Elon, Greta Thunberg, or king of the cucks Will Smith. The only criticism I see are all irrelevant, like his last venture from 10 YEARS AGO failing, or there's so much competition for EVs (see my last post for why these are regard statements) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tjexmikwx50c1.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2620b747cfd0cc55f12603d409023f49bb4ce9a0\n\n* **Plan B still in play** \\- I always still have my small investments in both AMZN and Uber to lift me up and make me a millionaire if FSR goes tits up.\n\nAnyways, that's it. Not financial advice. I f\\*cking love this stock and I love this ride.", "id": "17uhzr0", "created_utc": 1699902209.0, "score": 96, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 154, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|2|**First Seen In WSB**|3 months ago\n**Total Comments**|3|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|10 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n>TL;DR: I love this car and this company, even more so than Tesla.

It is almost never the case in this sub when people think a short squeeze is possible for a stock but this is actually one that *could* get squeezed.

BUT it isn't impossible given the borrow rate, relatively small float and institutions only control around 50% of the float.  \n\nThat being said, this is not at all near a Gamestop type of scenario.  If there is a squeeze it probably wouldn't go too far.\n\nPersonally, I wouldn't go anywhere near this stock.  Their product is too expensive in this economy and has like zero chance to compete with Tesla.  And keep in mind if a stock is getting heavily shorted that means a lot of people that know more than you think this company is screwed.  They aren't screwing the company, they are betting against it and probably for a good reason.  99.99999999% of the time thinking you are going to outsmart the \"hur dee hrr gay bears\" you are going to have a bad time.\n\nAlso, there will not be another Gamestop type squeeze.
