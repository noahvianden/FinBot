Absolutely an impressive but frustrating day to trade. \n\nThat morning sell off has absolutely no chill at all… we straight dumped without even the thought or whisper of a pullback. That was one of the most aggressive downtrends we have seen in a while. What is even crazier is that we managed to recover it all…\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4mokemxia0ka1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=d7ebee6e2a441a5b00de61f0c76301b1d39a69c8\n\nTomorrow morning we get a doozy of data… consumer spending/ persona income is going to be very interesting to see and not only that we get PCE and Core PCE… with the preliminary PCE numbers along with PPI/ CPI we should be expecting some pretty hot numbers to come in. I will be very interesting to see how the markets digest these numbers. \n\nThe markets this morning despite lower jobs data and preliminary PCE hot reacted bearishly and then recovered it all… however, most of that might have been related to the nvidia pump. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qjs47dbja0ka1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=576949f72831ce8e1e9b87a10d4a963bf6f8e88b\n\nThe biggest thing to note on the daily here is the fight around the daily 200ema which sits currently at 399.93. Now if you take a look at the candle body resistance from January 23rd and candle body support from January 30th you can see that this 400.6 level that we closed on today is a big pivot level. Back in January when we had our breakout over 390 and 400 this is where we rejected for 3 days in a row, and then back tested support of before we broke out. \n\nBulls continuing to defend this level could show some overall strength. \n\nHowever we have now closed 3 full candles below the daily 8ema which has not happened since middle of December when we were in the 380s. There is a very clear uptrend break, however, the question still remains of 390 or 405 retest first? \n\nMy thoughts are that IF we get a good PCE beat tomorrow (as in lower than expected) then we COULD see a push back to retest daily 8ema/ 405.3 resistance. If we close below that level that would could be seen as a retest/ rejection and bearish for next week. However, a recovery back over 405.3 would be extremely bullish. \n\nIF we get HOT PCE and markets digest that negatively we could be looking at a bigger sell off that sticks. A closure under the daily 200ema and potentially off that 100ema near 396.6 that we bounced off today would be very bearish going forward. Now that we put in a green day here the chances of further sell off is greater. \n\nKey SPY Support- 400.6 -> 398.5 -> 396.6\n\nKey SPY Resistance- 401.5 -> 403.2 -> 405.3\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/07cbp6rja0ka1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=684f039ad81a3ef3267b2c8b2c0460cbfe7b59ba\n\nTaking a look at futures daily here we actually have not taken back the daily 200ema and remain currently under neath that which sits at 4018. \n\nThe biggest thing to note here is that futures lost that key 4030 pivot level on Tuesday and now have failed 2 days in a row to break through and hold over that level. As long as bears hold us under 4030 the downside is greater than the upside in my opinion. \n\nThe biggest support area is that 3985 which is the daily 100ema though. \n\nKey Futures support- 4010 -> 3998 -> 3985 -> 3965\n\nKey Futures resistance- 4030 -> 4055 -> 4085\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mhk8ijdka0ka1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a2b0985e1f4d96a89d225ac876e4fab8017462c\n\nTesla continues to show impressive strength holding support off 197.1 for the 4th day in a row now… As long as 197.1 support continues to hold we shouldn’t expect a bigger sell off… yet… The last 5 days now have been pretty much a fight over the daily 8ema back and forth. IT is clear that the upside momentum has slowed, however, it is not quite clear just yet that the overall downside move is coming. \n\nTesla is holding a nice 197.1 to 204.8 range and those should be the levels we watch closest for a breakout or breakdown. \n\nKey Tesla Support- 202.1 -> 197.3 -> 191.8\n\nKey Tesla Resistance- 205 -> 209.2 -> 214.3\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t7rovwmma0ka1.png?width=618&format=png&auto=webp&s=7816d8a0b5b15e8162df34851ac70f7f9bd1e84f\n\nThe VIX finally came down and have a nice gap fill today. IT did maintain daily 8ema support also. The VIX doesn’t give us a whole lot of direction here at all. However, holding daily 8ema support should be bullish (as in markets will continue down). However if we break back under 21 tomorrow that push back to 405.3 resistance becomes even more probable. \n\n**Daily log-** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vyjof9ela0ka1.png?width=805&format=png&auto=webp&s=c3882ad457f74a5cbdf11127dd927634466b366b\n\nNot too bad of a day trading today. I got burnt in that 4dte call this morning on a fake breakout pretty much moments before that massive $6 dump started. And honestly based on everything I saw at that moment and my rules I would take that play again. It was a good play just didn’t work out. \n\nOnly other lost today came from getting burnt on this reversal. Historically speaking despite what SPY and 2022 wants us to believe… to full on reverse spy like it did today is actually not common and shouldn’t be expected… Take a look at Tuesday for example we had 3 or 4 moves throughout the day that looked extremely convincing of a big ole reversal upside that was just a put opportunity. I expected the same today and that 1pm double top rejection that then turned into a massive rip to the upside burnt me in puts. I had a few times I could have exited green but again I really did expect a push back to LOD and probability suggested the same. \n\nI was happy that I was able to close all of my 30dte (besides AMD/ Nvidia) at the LOD on SPY which was also the LOD on them. The only ticker I would have held longer or wanted to hold longer would have been Google. \n\nOverall looking at SPY weekly and tech as a whole weeklies (outside of nvidia) there is still a convincing case for downside to continues into the next CPI/ FOMC. However, we also have to take into account that we very well might just end up back in another $10 range from 390 to 400 or 395 to 405.", "id": "11a9amh", "created_utc": 1677187709.0, "score": 65, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 99, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|10|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|4311|**Previous Best DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1144ms6/50_bps_hike_the_nail_in_the_bear_coffin_21623_spy/) \n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\nHey /u/DaddyDersch, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.\n>TL;DR: - SPY impressive but frustrating day to trade", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Might enter 30DTE NVDA puts after today… Looking really juicy 👀", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "[removed]", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "What do you think target wise? 180s?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "[removed]", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "3/17 190P are going for .91/.94 bid ask from what I can see.

We actually began 3 months EARLY to decline in anticipation of the rate hikes. Highly unusual. I hate to say this phrase, but we very early on in the season started to price in the economic slowdown, and massive hedges were bought, so this ruined everything for bears since the trade got overcrowded. Also, the irony is that this being the most anticipated recession in history, companies already began since last year cutting back on inventory, expense, and personnell.

For example, I'm watching a 4010 lower support for a buy signal, the price comes down thru 4020 and breaks down to 4017. Hovers for a while and lowers to a 4013. Then back to 4020. If that level like that 4010 doesn't get tested do we just keep that 4020 as a solid level.
