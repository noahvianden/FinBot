{"title": "Bloomberg: Meta Asks Many Managers to Get Back to Making Things or Leave", "selftext": "The cost-cutting continues, and I'm bullish. Here's [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-02-07/meta-to-ask-many-managers-to-become-individual-contributors-or-leave?srnd=premium).\n\n> *A ‘flattening’ is taking place as Mark Zuckerberg aims for greater efficiency*\n\n>  Meta Platforms Inc.  is asking many of its managers and directors to transition to individual contributor jobs or leave the company as it tries to become more efficient, according to people familiar with the matter.\n> \n> The process is known internally as a \"flattening,\" the people said. Higher-level managers are sharing the directive with their subordinates in the coming weeks, separate from the company’s regular performance reviews that are currently underway, said the people, who asked not to be named discussing a matter that wasn’t public. Individual contributors aren’t in charge of others, and instead focus on tasks like coding, designing and research.\n> \n> Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, **fired 13% of its workforce in November** during its first major layoff. In the months since, staff have faced intense anxiety about the potential for future cuts, the people said. Meta Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg explained during the company’s earnings report this month that he still felt the organization was too slow-moving and bloated. He called 2023 the “Year of Efficiency” and vowed to cut middle-managers and underperforming projects. \n> \n> The *current round of job cuts will be more gradual, enacted on an individual basis*, the people said.  Some Meta employees said they felt the change was needed given the organization includes some teams that compete to achieve similar goals and managers that oversee only one or two employees, the people said. Meta declined to comment.\n> \n> Zuckerberg’s plan for a leaner organization helped the share price recover from 2022, which was its worst year ever. It’s **up more than 56% so far this year**. \n\nCriticism of Meta's efficiency is not new. [Here is John Carmack](https://www.businessinsider.com/former-meta-oculus-vr-executive-john-carmack-criticizes-spending-2023-2), the \"consulting CTO for the company's virtual reality efforts in 2019 after Meta acquired Oculus in 2014. He had previously been Oculus' CTO. Carmack left Meta in 2022 and has since turned his focus to artificial intelligence through his startup Keen Technologies.\"\n\n> \"I was having some real issues at Meta with large-scale strategic directions,\" Carmack said in an interview with the business publication, Dallas Innovates. \"I'm sure you've seen some of the headlines about how much money they're spending, and I thought large fractions were really poorly spent.\" [...]\n\n> \"I have never been able to kill stupid things before they cause damage, or set a direction and have a team actually stick to it,\" Carmack said in the memo.\n> \n> Carmack also said at the time that the company has \"a ridiculous amount of people and resources, but we constantly self-sabotage and squander effort.\"\n> \n> \"There is no way to sugar coat this; I think our organization is operating at half the effectiveness that would make me happy,\" he said.\n\nZuckerberg is turning much more responsive to shareholders at this point than his peers after all the share price destruction.

That wasn’t the point. I agree there are a lot of managers who should go or transfer to IC role if they are good at it. I still do think that will be tricky in practice because orgs with proper leaders would’ve typically already identified and addressed such problems, without input from above; but it’s possible this is the right move for some companies, Meta included.\n\nOriginal answer:\nAs someone working in FAANG (or whatever we call it these days) I disagree with you. I understand where you’re coming from and I’d probably say the same 10 years ago. \n\nFull disclosure: I’m not at Meta and I’m totally capable of switching to IC and be successful but this is not where I add the most value and my teams recognize it. I spend most of my days doing work that my teams aren’t as effective at: aligning external stakeholders, making sure we actually do make decisions instead of being stuck in analysis paralysis, coaching my teams so that they can do that themselves. \n\nIn a way, my job is to manage myself out of the job. But most importantly, I own the outcomes. I’m the one accountable: when my org succeeds - it’s their success. When they fail - that’s on me. My strength is ability to speak my teams’ language, my leadership’ language, as well as product and every other partner and stakeholder. \n\nSome time ago Google released a study called project oxygen, explaining which manager’s qualities make or break teams. Ironically, the original thought behind the study was to prove/debunk the point that managers are useless; and they found that solid leaders are a necessity. \n\nIf I was ever presented with this option, I’d leave. Not because I can’t do it, but because I can have more impact, and add more value by doing what I do today.

Organizations typically rot from the top, so the real problem is unlikely to be addressed with such a move. More likely, bad managers are going to stay and protect those who are the best at managing up, who tend to be the ones that only care about themselves.\n\nAnd, for what’s it worth, this might be the right move for Meta.

{"title": "Turkey: Hyperinflation and Earthquakes = a possible short side play", "selftext": "Unless you are a recluse hiding in a bunker with no internet, you by now know that large sections of the country of Turkey have been destroyed by a series of horrible earthquakes over the past several days. [Since the Turkish economy is being literally battered by earthquakes, the Turkish stock exchange was just halted today FOR THE NEXT 5 DAYS](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/turkish-bourse-shuts-five-days-in-unprecedented-move-trades-cancelled/ar-AA17fYsu). What you might also not know, is that even before the earthquake, Turkey has been experiencing insane levels of inflation approaching hyperinflationary levels. [While you may complain about 7% inflation here in the US, just prior to the earthquakes Turkey was experiencing 58% inflation.](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/turkey-inflation-higher-than-expected-nearly-58-2023-02-03/) Unlike the United States, history has shown that betting against the economy of Turkey is in fact sometimes a great bet. Turkey previously had inflation so high that the average person who used 5 lira banknotes in the late 1960’s was forced to use 1 million lira banknotes by the mid 1990’s!  It got so bad, that Turkey was forced to revalue its currency.  \n \n\n[\\\\\"Every man a millionaire\\\\\"](https://preview.redd.it/9e91e1jf10ha1.jpg?width=469&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c6d0f58b532f5ab0e9f268e847dddfca432aee23)\n\nSo, you’re saying to yourself now, that’s nice Scipio, thanks the history lesson, but why bother posting about this? Because there may be an opportunity to make money by betting against the Turkish economy. How may I do this you ask? Well, you can short individual Turkish companies, but overall if you want to bet against the entire Turkish economy you can either short the Turkish lira itself or bet that ETFs tracking the Turkish stock market will go down. Incredibly as it sounds, the wunderkinds at Vanguard have set up the iShares MSCI Turkey ETF which lets you “invest” in a basket of Turkish stocks. [Its currently down over 4% today as of this post, but earlier in the year was much much lower than it is now.](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TUR)Will it go down more?

{"title": "2-8-23 SPY/ ES Futures and Tesla Daily Market Analysis", "selftext": "After what I would say was a re-iteration of hawkishness from not only JPOW yesterday but also from all the fed speakers intraday today we finally had a negative reaction market wise. However, there is still a case that this is going to continue to push higher leading into CPI.\n\nWe are now 4 days away from CPI and while officially YoY consensus has not hit the markets yet we are seeing preliminary numbers suggesting yet another CPI/ CORE YoY beat but a very probably rebound on CPI/ CORE MoM. The question will then remain… Do markets want to and care more about the YoY decline or do they care more about a significant rebound of MoM? If you remember we got our first negative MoM reading since 2020 I believe it was and the markets STILL didn’t rally. Which honestly when you look at what has happened since CPI its quite incredible that we didn’t rally off that. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uuar5ezro1ha1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=dbbc8df4bbfb653ae55bf791ac0b30d2661ac548\n\nToday was your classic inside day pattern on SPY and Futures. We didn’t quite see that 415.2 resistance retested and we didn’t quite get all the way back down to key support at 408.8 that I would have liked to seen tested. \n\nSo while we did close red today in all reality its hard to call this bearish yet. We also managed to wick down to the daily 8ema and hold that support line. With the break through of that bull channel support yesterday we have now restructured our bull channel and restructured the broken resistance line and find ourselves yet again in another break out/ break down triangle.\n\nKey support remains at 410.9 (that means SPY has to open green and hold green all day) and key resistance remains at 415.2. \n\nWe have not closed a candle below the daily 8ema since January 19th and we have only closed two candles below the daily 8ema since January 5th… so almost 5 weeks of trading all supported by the daily 8ema…. Still incredibly impressive strength here shown by SPY. \n\nFrom a bearish standpoint they want to see a close below 408.8 tomorrow which puts us closed below the daily 8ema and would most likely result in a test of 405.3 support. If the bulls lose that support then we start talking about a bigger drop down to 400 support. \n\nHowever, if the bulls can turn this inside day into a bullish pattern and reclaim 415.2 resistance and most importantly close over that resistance I would feel comfortable in a rally to 419.5 leading into CPI. \n\nKey SPY Support- 410.6 -> 408.8 -> 406.6 -> 405.3 -> 403\n\nKey SPY Resistance- 413.2 -> 415.2 -> 416.9 -> 419.5\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n3h5stkso1ha1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=d360a828039ae3ff7ed086f0774b0aa5353859e8\n\nWhile its not nearly as clear on SPY as it is here on Futes we are actually seeing a potential bull flag here on the daily which would confirm that breakout rally to 419.5/ 4200+.\n\nNow I mentioned yesterday that despite the daily 8ema support bounce/ double bottom we had to worry about that bigger double top off 4177 and that a retrace today was highly probable. My key support to watch today was 4145 and 4123. With this now being the third day in a row to touch and bounce off the daily 8ema we should be looking for a bigger move either below or under that 8ema tomorrow. \n\nWe had a true inside day here on futes and we rejected both key resistance at 4177 and bounced off key support at 4123. We do not have a true sense of direction just yet. \n\nTomorrow the bulls need a closure over 4177 and we are going to start looking at a rally to 4210+. However, the bears could secure a close below 4123 tomorrow which would open up a sell off into that 4085/4095 support area. \n\nAs frustrating as it is both scenarios are highly probable. There is also a breakout triangle formed here on futures and it should be noted that futes never lost its original bull channel support which lies at 4105 for tomorrow and breakout resistance will be at 4175. So we will keep a close eye on those levels tomorrow. \n\nKey Futures Support- 4123 -> 4095 -> 4085 -> 4040 -> 4030\n\nKey Futures Resistance- 4145 -> 4177 -> 4210 \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/moq1rb6to1ha1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=c99f9381b257c57d2bc3d9ebbc01475da5dd9280\n\nTesla with an impressive feat has now closed its 7th green day in a row. It did have a notable 8 green days in a row back in March 2022, May 2013 and April 2020 it managed to put in a 10 day in a row green streak also. \n\nThe question remains… how much does this rally have left? I restructured our blue rising wedge support line after yesterdays support bounce and today we once again lost that support but managed to find intraday strength and closed green. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rdbuz7oto1ha1.png?width=947&format=png&auto=webp&s=37b273e8aa1ecc57bbace5e68e2d281eead3354f\n\nIm not saying a well placed tweet late last night about a Master Plan 3 for Tesla for its March 1st investors day is to blame for todays strength but when SPY closes -1%+ red and everyone but Tesla closes red (nvidia closed at 0.14% green) something isn’t quite right… \n\nSo the question remains… how much meme could a meme meme if a meme could meme? As much as a meme could meme… if a meme could meme… \n\nWe are incredibly now closing in on the daily 200ema on Tesla which sits at 214.9. That would be another impressive 7%+ rally from todays close for Tesla to get there but it is a very real possibility unless the flood gates finally open. \n\nToday SPY showed true weakness for the first time in quite a long time and this time the rest of tech followed that weakness too. \n\nTesla the last few days really the last week of trading besides last Friday has come out very weak with a morning sell of and by some miracle continues to find strength to push this higher. Today the bulls finally closed over 197.1 and broke through that 200 price target. \n\nIts pretty frustrating here because the logical choice here is 100% puts and I just keep waiting for that morning Tesla opens -4% for no reason but this thing just wont stop going up. But after a nearly 110% rally over 5-6 weeks I truly can not justify calls. \n\nMy thoughts remain if SPY doesn’t have a breakdown into CPI retesting 400-405 and choses to rally that tesla is probably going to push for some sort of incredible blowoff top up in that 230-250 range. However, if we see a market wide sell off leading into CPI Tesla has the most to lose (next to probably nvidia). The issue now is when. \n\nMy other thoughts remain if CPI does miss next week on Tuesday and we finally see the wind taken outta the bulls sails that Tesla and all these other memes and tech stocks who have rallied mercilessly the last 7 weeks are going to have some incredible sell offs. \n\nKey Tesla Support- 196.1 -> 190.2 -> 183.9\n\nKey Tesla Resistance- 201.5 -> 204.8 -> 208.8 -> 214.9\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nc8lbq6vo1ha1.png?width=618&format=png&auto=webp&s=45f2fefdf7b9e5ac4ddbdfd3911bbcace8ca25d6\n\nThe last piece of the puzzle that makes me believe SPY at least is going to see a more major sell off here over the next few days is the VIX. Ow I mentioned yesterday that we broke that 4 month long resistance line. However, today we actually broke yesterdays HOD for the VIX and today we closed right at that key 19.6/19.7 resistance line. \n\nIF the VIX continues this trend up tomorrow and especially if it turns its daily 20ema into support we could be seeing a more significant pullback on spy. \n\nSomething to note here is the fact that the VIX closed over its daily 20ema for the first time since January 5th. \n\nWe have not had a full candle over the daily 8ema since then and have only closed 1 candle over 19.7 since January 23rd. If the VIX continues this rally up we are going to see a bigger retrace here on SPY and my target will remain 390-400 for any significant retrace. \n\nWe are once again finding ourselves at a crossroads here on SPY. We have the bearish pieces of the puzzle starting to form, however, for the last 7 weeks every time the bears attempted to make a move the bulls have absolutely crushed their hopes and dreams. \n\nUp until realistically FOMC day we were rallying on technical (talking about SPY here) and momentum but for the last week now we have been rallying on I don’t even know what. It sure feels like the algos buy button is stuck and they haven’t figured out how to unstick it yet. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z2ggirnvo1ha1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=d21f0118f9b27fac73f18c06c1971bf5422b6a39\n\nNext two days do have some decent data which is jobs tomorrow. However, something to keep in mind is that JPOW despite saying he did not like how strong the labor force was did allude to him essentially not caring about jobs as much… it will actually be telling tomorrow to see how the algos react to this data. \n\nFriday we have UMICH sentiment which I am pretty sure has resulted in a rally almost every single Friday at 10am for the last 4+ weeks. \n\n**Daily log-**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1oboau8wo1ha1.png?width=791&format=png&auto=webp&s=3dd74e94bd619eb5aca4aa3a0e34b98d1853c695\n\nToday was one of those highly frustrating days where price action was so incredibly violent and all over the place that we just couldn’t get good entries, or exits. Win rate wise played today fairly well obviously but that one stop loss hunt only for SPY to drop even further after I got hunted was highly frustrating. \n\nThe last week or two has become increasingly difficult to trade. I am finding myself missing the obvious moves on one play… as in today we hard rejected a key level I watch but by time I “believed it” the play was already up 10%+ and at that point its chasing/ fomo… and on the next play I take the obvious entry that follows every single on of my rules and end up getting stop loss hunted before the move ever comes to pay me. \n\nLonger DTE plays/ holds we are also at a highly frustrating time period here as we have CPI in 4 days so going long is extremely risky as we could easily see a massive dump on SPY leading into CPI like the past or we could see a highly regarded rally into CPI like September. \n\nThe rally has lasted so long now with out any meaningful pullback OR consolidation that for me at least to continue to believe in upside here is tough. \n\nI do see an upside case for 420 to 430 depending on what CPI brings us but I also realize how far gone this rally on SPY has gone and especially on other tickers like Tesla/ Nvidia that I just cant quite bring myself to fully bet against it anymore. \n\nThe market has put us in between a rock and a hard place… we have three options here… \n\n1. We sit cash gang (I like this option) and play intraday trends and trade lightly until technical tighten back up\n\n2. You go long on calls and believe in the strength of the bulls and bull market and hope that you aren’t buying the literal top. \n\n3. You go long on puts believing that even in a true bull market stocks do not go up forever and you risk missing out on the next 5-10% move up in the markets. \n\nHonestly all three options have their downside. Even just trading intraday we are left with these extremely choppy and irrational days that make it nearly impossible to gain any true edge. When the price of SPY decides its going to pump $1 on a 15min candle only to immediately drop $1.5 then next candle and then rally back $1.25 the next candle its nearly impossible to lock into a trend and trade this well. \n\nFor me until something breaks the bulls back its light trading and preserving capital for the next big move.", "id": "10xdpkx", "created_utc": 1675897070.0, "score": 124, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 81, "comments": [{"body": "Vix def breaking out.

The current chart has severely diverged from liquidity. Liquidity is almost at October low levels (December was lower but that one was a sharp spike due to end of year RRP pump). Whatever is propping the market up rn is not liquidity which is abnormal since markets have been liquidity driven since 2021 with strong direct correlation. This is also why we’re seeing this wild intraday moves. There’s no liquidity. Shits getting volatile and choppy. It’s very diff from prior bear markets because this one is tied to liquidity. I like to reference historical models since bear markets have a lot in common but right now if we get a whiff of bad news or good news really the market will move ALOT. the problem with the bull case is liquidity is proportional to market going up.
