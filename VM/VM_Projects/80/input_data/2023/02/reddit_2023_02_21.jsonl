In 2022 their gross automotive margins net of regulatory credit sales was 26.66% and revenue per vehicle delivered net of regulatory credit sales was $53,039.50.

If those figures drop to 20% (per company guidance, though they also weren't including leasing which is a small percentage of sales but has higher margins) and $47,500 for 2023, that means Tesla would need to ship 1.95 million vehicles in the year just to match the same gross profit net of regulatory credit sales that they had in 2022.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Appreciate this response.
