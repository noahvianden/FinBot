In fact, advertising could eventually *help* the goal of getting an EV in every driveway, because at some point they will need more demand to keep growing production profitably. \n\nNo, the cars were not selling enough before the price cut. Their production increased a lot last year, and their order rate was no longer enough to match the higher production level. That's why Tesla's inventory rose sharply towards the end of last year and they limited production at their Shanghai factory for a month. Of course, their level of demand is extremely high.

I love driving my Tesla more than any other car I've ever driven.  Tesla didn't *need* to advertise to me, just get me to do a test drive.  And that happened when I rented one on vacation from Hertz because why not.  \n\nIf Tesla wanted to spend money on marketing- I'd suggest that money would be best spent cutting deals with rental car companies to replace most of their fleet with cut-price Teslas.  Sell or lease the rental car company a Tesla for 2-3 years, about 30-50k miles, at a very reduced rate.  The rental company will love this because Teslas need almost no maintenance.  Then Tesla takes the car back, adds FSD (jacking the price by $15k), and sells it as a used car.

Advertising purely helps profits.\n\nEven if you think all of the inventory increase in the US last year was because people were waiting for the tax credit, that doesn't explain why it increased at the start of this year, and it doesn't explain why it increased in Europe and China as well. They obviously had to cut prices in order to sell the massive number of cars they were producing. If they had more demand due to advertising, the price cuts could've smaller or nonexistent. \n\nYou need to make the distinction between demand and quantity demanded. Demand is a function. Quantity demanded is a number. Quantity demanded is determined by both demand and price. What I think you mean to say is that Tesla hasn't been able to meet their quantity demanded at the current prices by a longshot. If that were true, then they would have massive backlogs of several months. But they don't, so it's clearly not true. Even less so at the previous prices. At the previous prices their production was actually above the quantity demanded. That's why they had to drop prices. It's either that or scale back production. Whereas if their demand was higher, they wouldn't have to cut prices to sell all those cars.\n\nOf course Tesla doesn't need to advertise to sell lots of cars at high prices. Their demand is clearly very high today, and that's without advertising. The point I'm making is it could be *even higher* if they advertise. That would increase profits without hurting Tesla's goal of getting an EV in every driveway at all.

With 348.11 being out 52 week low 20% higher than that was officially 417.74 to enter a new bull market. \n\nWhen we pushed to $418.31 today we by technical definition ended the bear market… now there is some discrepancy that you have to close over that level verses just touch it… but the definition I have seen most commonly uses is price action crossing it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ivfxf33i0vfa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=7484cd38a14cfe5c0fdade908ccf1f5355c280ef\n\nTonight we got Google, Amazon and Apple earnings being released. \n\nGoogle with a miss on all revenue and Amazon with a miss on q1 net sales, aws net sales and q4 net sales but a beat on subscription sales…. Overall two good sized misses there. \n\nTo be honest Apple actually kinda missed in a pretty impressive way here… realistically besides china q1 they shit the bed on this one. \n\nMarkets still pretty red here on SPY right now. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lyl50tpi0vfa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=17a251ccb5c7ed3f0a9702d2d96a9b13adde8867\n\nWe also have a wildcard of data in the morning with nonfarm payrolls, unemployement rate and average hourly rate. Last time we got this data we had a 1%+ green open. Historically last year any unemployment data days opened us with +/- 1%. The issue is that premiums and IV already has that priced in. For instance for Friday DTE puts/ calls they are about 2x their normal value already. \n\nThank brings me to my next interesting thing from today…\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xkqvz1ij0vfa1.png?width=233&format=png&auto=webp&s=627cbd58dfc9e348add2f228ee081e3b438f5cd8\n\nWe saw IV hit a pretty incredible level intraday today. We at one point going into power hour we actually saw IV hit 70%. Generally speaking IV should be the highest near open and steadily decrease throughout the day. And on a bullish day like today we should see lower than usual IV. However, we actually saw a very steady increase in IV all day long today. Very peculiar. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dc7oi9yj0vfa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=119d8155f61571012f6841f3321b30b233ca3486\n\nLooking at SPY daily here you can see that we had a huge run up today. We are forming one of those classic abandoned baby patterns here too… We could with the help of this Goolgle and Amazon earnings miss see a good sized red day tomorrow. \n\nInterestingly enough we have now seen 8 out of the last 10 days on SPY close green. And we have seen 6 of those 8 close 1%+ green also. \n\nFrom a technical stand point we touched and broke through the bull market line… by book definition this is now a bull market. What is even more incredible to watch how these algos work is that we dumped $5 as soon as we touched that and broke through. Very impressive. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4br8dgjk0vfa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=d24f6a7123668c855fe36aa54d4a54d98f02b56e\n\nWhat I am really keeping an eye on tomorrow is close. Tomorrow we close out that weekly candle. If we close that weekly candle under 408.8 I would be extremely bearish for next week. However, realistically anything over that we could look for some further upside. I am eyeing a potential move up as high as 427.5 before CPI on February 14th. I am not positive that we will get there. As we very well could see this be a top. If you see that August peak there is a soft resistance line at 417.1 which we are currently hard rejecting. WE could very well turn this into a double top here. \n\nKey SPY Support- 414.8 -> 410.9 -> 406.5\n\nKey SPY Resistance- 416.8 -> 419.5 -> 422.1\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e6taee1l0vfa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e1ca0238e65d79b98c3167fa8f07bf195cee1bd\n\nFutures putting in a reversal candle here also seeing this 4193 resistance but putting in a new support level at 4145. \n\nAs you can see we are also in this very impressive bull channel right now that at some point is going to break and break very hard. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4vd5sxjl0vfa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=5035729ef7d41c2d382b8702060ab922e163ec2a\n\nMuch like SPY we are watching some key levels here on the weekly. \n\nKey weekly support for bulls to defend is 4095 (-1.8%) and key resistance that would make for an even more bullish weekly close is 4220. There still is very much so a road to 4280 here on futures. However, I am not sure if we retest 4095 first or not. \n\nKey Futures Support- 4145 -> 4132 -> 4095\n\nKey Futures Resistance- 4193 -> 4235\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/npfde6em0vfa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=38d1da6a788db73945d9fb6c8b9ffb96cbd0c753\n\nTesla frustrated me today. I have been holding some 22dte puts. I fully see an opportunity for Tesla to retrace to the 150s. I sold pretty much around the time we broke through 192 resistance today as I full saw a road to touching that 197.2 resistance and continuing this run up. Only to have Tesla completely retrace EOD. \n\nGranted I would still be very red but with 22dte and this candle formation I would be higher probability of green. \n\nLooking at tesla here we did finally see the daily 100ema broken and closed over. However this massive gravestone doji here formed a beautiful evening doji star pattern and should lead to a pretty good sized sell off tomorrow. \n\nI was very interested in playing that, however, the IV was extremely high on 0dte for tomorrow and I was not willing to take a chance with 3 major tech earnings tonight after hours. If we break that blue bull channel support at 181.5 tomorrow I would be interested in a short for next week. \n\nKey Tesla Support- 187.2 -> 181.5 -> 177.9 -> 173.9\n\nKey Tesla Resistance- 191.7 -> 197.2 -> 201\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yy82943o0vfa1.png?width=608&format=png&auto=webp&s=2df46e296ec470fcf716294741dc08976904bc71\n\nThe conversation of the day is the fact that the VIX closed 4.82% green on a day that SPY also closed green. IT was impressive to see the VIX continue to rise around mid day while SPY also rose. I am not quite sure what to make of that. But it would appear that we have reached a bottom on the VIX for now. \n\n**Daily log-** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hmy78omo0vfa1.png?width=795&format=png&auto=webp&s=922f9d86f823984b2831164a374f2b8353a0345b\n\nTerrible day here today due to the SPY swing and then closing out that Tesla loser. Slightly red week here so far. See what tomorrow brings though. \n\nIn the end not every day will be green, and not every week will be green. The two puts I got stopped out of this morning followed every one of my rules. I cant be upset when that happens. I also took a very high probability swing that unfortunately did not work out.
