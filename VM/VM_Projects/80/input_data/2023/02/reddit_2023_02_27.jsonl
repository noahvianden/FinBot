{"title": "Tipping point of a bull market or the next collapse?", "selftext": "We have had a massive rally this past 3 months, with spy being up almost +10% on feb peak since the start of the year, and the nasdaq being up almost 20% in that time period. Both of these have fallen about 5-6% since those peaks, with last weak spy being down 2.3% and nasdaq being 3.1% down. Most of these drops have been triggered by bad inflation reports, but without bad inflation coming out what will crash the market? Last Friday PCE came in HOT HOT, having grown 0.6%, and being 5.4% year over year, normally the market would have crashed 2%+ from this, but we only closed 1 percent down showing that the market is unwilling to crash. Further more the growth that we have had this year was mostly retail investors, and they are not showing any signs of stopping. We have crossed the support that held down the October bottom and the December lows, but that was pre market and we actually almost recovered and went above it again on Friday.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPersonally I think that the March low won't be going below 390-385, and it will quickly bounce up to that support that we broke on Friday. I think that next week is gonna be green with a potential bounce to 405 to 410, and then we will stay mostly flat until CPI. When CPI comes out we will plummet to those 390-385 levels but when FOMC happens they will do 25 bps hike which will send the market to the moon (420+ levels). Even if we stay flat next week (Which could very well happen) I will believe that we will bounce to 405-410 before CPI. \n\nWill see another October type low? Probably but it will probably be in L  ate Summer/Fall, while in the spring we will see smaller type bounces like we are seeing right now and like we saw in December.\n\nBut what do you guys think?
