{"title": "Robinhood: Risky Gamble or Lucrative Venture?", "selftext": "Good morning, good afternoon, good evening, and goodnight fellow regarded investors.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***TLDR:*** \n\nShort term bullish on Hood from growth caused by FTX collapse, and reliable revenue generation from margin and payment-for-order-flow in a bear market. Longer term bearish as SBF's Hood shares may be used to cover court expenses and compensation to FTX stakeholders.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**DD:** \n\nThis post is DD as of 2/4/2023. This post contains my BIASED opinions as well as factual information. I will cite any factual information. This post is biased because I am currently in a bullish position for Robinhood <$HOOD>. \n\n**Robinhood: Brief Overview**\n\n*History:*\n\nRobinhood is the first broker to bring \"free trading\" to retail investors (Investopedia - 1). Being the first broker to bring \"free trading\" to retail investors is no small feat. This is one of a few reasons that Robinhood has brought 22.9 million accounts to their platform as of Q3, 2022 (Q3 HOOD, pg 6). As the market <SNP500> rose from Q4 2020-Q3 2021, Robinhood experienced a related growth in Monthly Active Users from 11.7 million to a peak of 21.3 million (Q3 HOOD, pg7). During this time of growth the initial meme stock madness of Gamestop <GME> took place, where Robinhood removed the opportunity for investors to purchase GME shares  (CNBC). Many investors were outraged at Robinhood as they could no longer buy GME. Despite outrage, Robinhood had another quarter of user growth as this event unfolded in Q1 2022 (Q3 HOOD, pg 7). Not only did HOOD have growth during the quarter involving the outrage over GME, but the growth extended into the following quarter <Q2,2021> as well (Q3 Hood, pg7)!\n\n*Operations:*\n\n\"Robinhood Markets, Inc. operates financial services platform in the United States. Its platform allows users to invest in stocks, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), options, gold, and cryptocurrencies. The company also offers various learning and education solutions comprise Snacks, a digest of business news stories; Learn, which is a collection of approximately articles, including guides, feature tutorials, and financial dictionary; Newsfeeds that offer access to free premium news from various sites, such as Barron's, Reuters, and The Wall Street Journal; lists and alerts, which allow users to create custom watchlists and alerts to monitor securities, ETFs, and cryptocurrencies, as well as cash management services; and offers First trade recommendations to all new customers who have yet to place a trade. Robinhood Markets, Inc. was incorporated in 2013 and is headquartered in Menlo Park, California.\" (Yahoo Finance - Profile)\n\n*OK... so what do they actually do?*\n\nPayment for order flow, margin, stock lending, cash sweep (Q3 Financials, pg 17). A Broker <kinda>.\n\nImportantly, I believe that payment for order flow and margin are the most important components to Robinhood's operations. \n\nRobinhood allows investors to use margin on their accounts.  From Robinhood's website as of 2/4/2023: \"Robinhood Financial charges a standard margin interest rate of 11.25% and a margin interest rate of 7.25% for customers who subscribe to Gold. The margin interest rate is calculated by adding 6.5% (for non-Gold customers) or 2.5% (for Gold customers) to the upper bound of the Target Federal Funds Rate, which is set by the Federal Reserve and is subject to change without notice.\" (Hood - Margin). What's important here is that Robinhood is giving non gold members margin at a steep price, while incentivizing users to move to Gold <$5/month> for more favorable terms.\n\nUsers with Gold are guaranteed $5 revenue per month regardless of margin utilization or orders placed. \n\n**The Play:**\n\n*Current Thesis:*\n\nI am currently in, and will increase my short-term bullish position. I expect a drop in the stock price in the long term, so I have a long term bearish position as well.\n\n*Bullish:*\n\nNovember 11, 2022, FTX collapse (Investopedia - 2). Vlad Tenev <HOOD CEO> tweets the following during the FTX collapse: \"In this 'flight to safety', we're proud that customers are turning to Robinhood. \" (Vlad - Twitter). This migration which took place in Q4 2022, was likely not forecasted by analysts or Robinhood themselves. This shift in crypto may cause investors who have moved away from Robinhood to return, and possibly bring their other assets with them. My speculation is that more investors came back to or started with Robinhood increasing assets, and increasing revenues.\n\nThe market <SNP 500> was down over 2022, this may have caused retail investors to be locked into their losing positions. If an investor were to have purchased the security on margin, they were forced to hold or sell at a loss. Selling the losing position and likely entering into a new position generates payment for order flow revenue for HOOD. Holding the position and waiting for the market to turn around generates revenue on the margin lent to the investor. As of Q3 2022, margin revenue was up 31% Y/Y (Q3 Financials, pg 17). Ultimately, no matter what investors did during 2022, Hood profited. \n\n*Bearish:*\n\nSam Bankman-Fried <SBF>, former owner and CEO of FTX owned a few shares of Robinhood... 56 million shares (Coindesk - SBF). Based on the shares outstanding <835.68 million (Yahoo Finance - Statistics)> SBF held about 6.7% of the outstanding shares. SBF will need to pay for court expenses, and it's likely the assets could be used to pay back stakeholders affected by the FTX collapse.  \n\nHow will he pay for court expenses and compensate the stakeholders? Hood selloff - increasing the number of shares floating will drive down the price of Robinhood. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWorks Cited:\n\n[https://www.investopedia.com/investing/free-stock-trading-whats-catch/#:\\~:text=Robinhood%20pioneered%20commission%2Dfree%20trading,flow%20rose%20rapidly%20during%202020](https://www.investopedia.com/investing/free-stock-trading-whats-catch/#:~:text=Robinhood%20pioneered%20commission%2Dfree%20trading,flow%20rose%20rapidly%20during%202020).

Robinhood or Meta will push first. A lot of this comes from starting with a layer 2 on Ethereum and attracting capital onto their layer with appropriate bridges. It's now quite cheap for them to do it, and they could start to own payments, then after move to other financial products just copying a lot of systems in the DeFi space. Robinhood alone has 10x more app users than all of Ethereum. Not even going to say how many users are on WhatsApp.\n\nI'm a crypto guy but genuinely believe the next leg up of big investments is actually betting in companies that will adopt crypto. Crypto is here but I doubt we'll see any more 10x runs ever again. The moonboy era is over and every new chain is just fighting for a saturated market share.
