{"title": "Will The Bulls Keep Rallying Or Will We Collapse? SPY Prediction", "selftext": "We have had 2 important things in the past 2-3 weeks: Inflation and Powell/FED. For Inflation, CPI was ABOVE expectations, +0.5% and  6.4% YOY. PPI also come above expectations being +0.7%. The market did retreat 1.3% on Thursday but stayed mostly flat on Friday showing that the market wasn't fully thrown off by this data. Powell also held an interview in Tuesday 2 weeks ago, he again repeated the disinflation narrative from the FED meeting. This all tells us some things, the market is unaffected by all the negative inflation data and Powell is trying to boost up the market while still raising rates. Knowing this I believe that the market will go up in the next couple of weeks.  \n\n\nThe SPY key weekly support is: 407.1, 402.6, 398.6  \nThe SPY key weekly resistance: 412.3, 417, 422.4\n\nSpy doesn't have a big support between 407 and 402, but on Friday we went down to 404.06  and still rallied back to 407.26, showing that we are not ready to go below that 402.6 support. Next week we will probably bounce somewhere to 412.3 levels and hang around there. If we break 412.3 we might go to 417 but we will see.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf on Tuesday we break 407.1 again we might go to 402.6, but again looking at what happened on Friday its unlikely.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSummary: Inflation data didn't kill the market, and combined with Powell's disinflationary talk shows that the market isn't ready to fall. On Friday SPY broke the 407.1 support and fell to 404.06 but then still rallied back up to 407.38. Next week we will likely see a rebound to the 412.3 resistance and even if we fall back to below 407.1 I doubt we will go to the 402.6 support. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut what do you guys think?
