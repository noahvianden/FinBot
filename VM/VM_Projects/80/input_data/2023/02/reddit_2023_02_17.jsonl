If stocks are in a strong uptrend people don't want to sell them because of the potential profits vs the people that want to buy them.

The thing that people don't seem to realize is that inflation is probably putting a floor under stock prices rather than leading to crash. Simple. Raw materials get 20% more expensive -> Product becomes 25% more expensive (you adjust your profits margins to inflation as well over time) -> People get mad, demand 25% more salary -> buy same things -> Company stock intrinsic value is 25% higher. It takes time for this cycle to complete and the stockprice to adjust so current P/E is not that relevant during that period.
