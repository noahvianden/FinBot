They can’t buy yacht or home from personal money. They can’t give it to their kids. They can’t spend it on parties. There are extremely limited options, how they can enjoy money they gave to non profits and certainly no way how to spend hundreds of millions or billions for their own needs.  \nSo yeah, they put money from one pocket and give it to other, but they can’t take away from that pocket at all, even though they have control.  \nSecond thing was completely irrelevant, as they said that those billioners can chose what this charity supports and it may not be best for everyone. Like duh. Yes, you give money to causes that you want, not what government tell you you should. why is that even point?  \nThe only thing that hold some merit is donating to political campaigns, but almost every company and every billionaire does it from their personal or business account, not from non-profit. Certainly no billions go from non profits into campaigns, so this has a merit, but extremely limited scope.  \nAnother irrelevant thing is that those non profits can invest money - so what? at least more money will be spent on charity, eventually. It’s not like those billionaire can take these profits to themselves.  \nTax breaks. Again, no benefit to billionaire, because he won’t ever see that money again, as their use is very limited. If he spends billion on himself, he will pay same taxes, since charities doesn’t decrease tax from personal income - you just don’t pay tax from what you donate.  \nand why are there billionaires in the first place? Yeah, that has nothing to do with charities.  \n  \nIMHO - close tax heavens loopholes (every US citizen to pay tax also in US from any international income, unless there is an agreement with that country. And to require disclosure of ownership of all international companies, if you reside in US, under threat of jail). And close inheritance loophole (those who inherit wealth, if they decide to sell the assets and enjoy the money, should have same value basis for tax purposes as ancestor did, so they pay full taxes owed by ancestor, not just difference between price of asset at the time of ancestor death and sell price).
