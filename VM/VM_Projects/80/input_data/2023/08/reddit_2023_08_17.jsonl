{"title": "Why Are Analysts Increasing NVIDIA‚Äôs Price Target? Is It Out of Fear That Something Bad Will Happen, Leading Them to Encourage Others to Buy for their own profits?", "selftext": "NVIDIA, often considered the heart of AI stocks, has recently been in the spotlight as analysts uniformly raise their stock targets. To me, this trend seems somewhat peculiar, even considering the current earnings season. The buoyant optimism surrounding the stock‚Äôs potential rise is sparking doubt in my mind. Should the stock underperform, it will be a litmus test of these analysts‚Äô sincerity, raising questions about whether they may be manipulating public sentiment.\n\nIn the broader context of the semiconductor sector, the recent quarterly earnings have been largely underwhelming. Yet, all semiconductor stocks appear to be buoyed by NVIDIA‚Äôs momentum. A stumble in NVIDIA‚Äôs stock could trigger a broader tech market downfall, while success could reignite a bullish trend for tech stocks. My intuition, however, leans towards a potential disappointment. NVIDIA might surpass current estimates but simultaneously lower their future guidance due to sluggish growth. Should this occur, a significant drop in stock price could follow.\n\nDisclaimer: These thoughts are purely my own observations and should not be taken as financial advice.", "id": "15tcuqf", "created_utc": 1692246795.0, "score": 111, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 114, "comments": [{"body": "China put in an order for 5 billion usd or something to get ahead of sanctions I read", "score": 42, "replies": [{"body": "So you are saying the 11b revenue estimate they put out last quarter that made everyone go dipshit crazy was a one time pull forward from china ordering.
