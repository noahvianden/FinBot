Be in a boring industry (necessary)\n2. 2x revenue growth over the last decade (nice to have)\n3. 3x net income growth over the last decade (nice to have)\n4.

Better than average Efficiency Ratio.\n2. 10 yr average Revenue-to-assets ratio >4.50%\n\nAfter all of this I would generally value the company using DCF (if there is stable FCF), or some other method.

I have my watch list set up to see which sectors and cap weight segments are moving, with some sector movers grouped together in the watch list. I also have a few picks of interest at the end of the list. \n\n2. I look at comparison charts to watch stocks or sectors for periods of underperformance relative to the S&P 500. \n\n3. When I see a company or sector underperforming, I want to understand why, so I‚Äôll review earnings reports and headline stories. I‚Äôm specifically looking for indications that the underperformance is driven by a short term problem or sentiment. For example, JPM took a relative hit in 2022 by announcing that they weren‚Äôt going to raise their dividend or approve buybacks after the bank stress tests, while all of the other big banks did both. Dimon‚Äôs bonus was denied by the board, and a lot of traders got out. \n\n4. I sometimes hold off on entry to allow the temporary drop to find a short term floor or range. If the market is trending down, I‚Äôm more likely to make the move without waiting for the underperformer to trade sideways. When the market is going up or sideways, I look for the flat spot before entry. \n\n5. I like swings based on relative performance gap narrowing. I‚Äôm looking for that pop as the underperformer catches up to the index or passes it. I‚Äôm not aiming for a 10x. Once I get the pop, I exit and put the money back into the index. \n\n6. I look at the options chain and determine how I want to express the trade. I‚Äôm fairly risk averse, so I usually use long shares or buy-writes with OTM CCs.
