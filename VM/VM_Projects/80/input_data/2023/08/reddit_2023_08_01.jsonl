We made strong progress meeting key hardware and software milestones to address the growing customer pull for our data center AI solutions and are on-track to launch and ramp production of MI300 accelerators in the fourth quarter.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWe are pleased with our second quarter execution,‚Äù said AMD EVP, CFO and Treasurer Jean Hu. ‚ÄúLooking to the third quarter, we expect our Data Center and Client segment revenues to each grow by a double-digit percentage sequentially driven by increasing demand for our EPYC and Ryzen processors, partially offset by Gaming and Embedded segment declines.‚Äù", "id": "15fnhs5", "created_utc": 1690921002.0, "score": 189, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 89, "comments": [{"body": "I‚Äôm honestly surprised it went up this much with results largely in line with expectations.
