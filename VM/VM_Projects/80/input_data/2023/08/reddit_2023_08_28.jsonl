The next safest after them is BYD, but there's a whole host of issues with investing in Chinese stocks, so I wouldn't recommend it.\n\nFord is probably in ok shape, but I'm not certain yet, they have a ton of debt, a lot of which is backed by loans given out via Ford credit on ICE vehicles that probably won't retain their value too well. Even if Ford as a company sticks around however I'm skeptical that they'll be a good investment, there's simply no growth for them in switching to EV's, unless some of their competitors go under in the process and Ford can pick up their market share. This is the same problem with most of the traditional automakers.\n\nGM might be ok, but I'm much more skeptical about them then Ford. IMO GM is making some bad investments in the wrong battery technology, and isn't moving fast enough to shift towards EV's, both of which will probably bite them in the butt at least some over the next 5 years.\n\nAnd I'm not going to sugarcoat it, at the rate things are going I think pretty much all of the Japanese automakers will either 1) go out of business, or 2) need bailed out by the Japanese government in the next 5 or so years. \n\nNissan especially looks horrendously screwed (which is ironic given how the Nissan Leaf used to one of the earliest affordable EV's in the market). They've heavily under-invested in EV's, and their credit rating has been cut to junk for very good reasons. If I had to bet on which Japanese automaker goes completely bankrupt in the next 10 years I'd put all of my money on Nissan.\n\nMazda meanwhile is trying to push alternate fuels for ICE vehicles to extend their life that will simply never take off because it'll be WAY more expensive than gasoline. And since Mazda is a smaller company they have much less money to invest in transitioning to EV's and much smaller room for error. And frankly I just don't think that they'll have enough political clot to get a bailout from the government when shit hits the fan for the Japanese auto industry.\n\nI don't know about Subaru. On one hand they're making the least amount of mistakes of the small Japanese automakers. On the other hand, the vast majority of Subaru's sales are made in the US, and yet Subaru makes most of their vehicles in Japan, which means that Subaru EV's won't be eligible for the EV tax credits, putting them at a big competitive disadvantage. And it's not like they're at the leading edge in EV's either.\n\nToyota and Honda have the size, for now, to survive over the next 5ish years despite dragging their feet so much on EV's. That said, I think no matter what either of these companies do today they've already guaranteed that they're going to lose at least a third of their worldwide market share at a minimum due to the EV transition, but probably even more then that.
