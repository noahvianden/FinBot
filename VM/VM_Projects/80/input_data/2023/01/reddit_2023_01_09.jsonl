Of the people I know under 30, there are a decent number in the US that own their own house (even single).  In China, 0.  The only people who can \"afford\" a home here in China if they are under 30 are ones that are only children and their parents gave it to them, oftentimes actually married where they had 4 parents pooling money together so that they can afford it.  Obviously, that's a huge difference.  \n\nIn addition, the \"house\" owned in China is a tiny condo in some skyscraper with a barely functional elevator.  Due to the way housing space is measured, all of the community areas, such as hallways and elevators, are also included in the cost.  Realistically, the \"houses\" owned in China have maybe 1/3 of the living space of what you would get in the US.  I live in Wuhan, not a particularly expensive location in China.  Interest rates have also generally been significantly higher in China if you want to take out a mortgage, which will also require a 50% down payment, although that is now getting closer since the Fed has been raising rates while the Chinese counterpart has been cutting rates.  The one thing going for youth in China is not having the same level of student loan debt.\n\nThey also have what they refer to as villas here in China.  Only the really rich can afford those.  There's a very similar counterpart in the US, we call them townhouses.  \n\nSo what's the difference?  There's a huge difference, but you're too ignorant about other countries and what poverty actually means to understand.  In addition, to save up all that money in the first place, people forgo tons of luxuries that people in the US frequently throw their money away on.  They could live with their parents for the first 5-10 years after college or live in a single room with 3 roomates, that's generally what happens here in China.  If Americans practiced even half the financial disipline that most people here practice, then youth in the US would easily be able to afford a starter home.  \n\nBy the way, these people I am referring to in China, these are generally the well off people that got a Master's degree.  The ones that didn't graduate middle school (which there are plenty of) or high school (which there are also plenty of) get to become migrant workers, see their only child and spouse once a year for 1 month, then live in a cramped dorm for 11 months out of the year where they live with a bunch of other people.\n\nIs this enough differences or would you like to come up with some other silly hardships that youth in America encounter and I can give you the Chinese equivalent for you to compare?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "So you’re going to compare inner city China to country farm America?

What’s your point?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Wait a minute, you want me to compare apples to apples for the US vs China?  Obviously that's impossible.  I was already comparing those who are better off in China to those that are relatively worse off in the US and demonstrating the disparities.\n\nFor example, inner city in China tends to be more educated while in the US it tends to be less educated.  People in the US are more educated than people in China.  The people I know in the US with houses only have a BA, whereas these people in China cannot get it with MAs.  I actually was comparing averages of both, but how about this, we can compare the most expensive city in each country, would that make you happy?\n\nActually, how about you just take a look for yourself.  Look at all the cities in China that are high up on this list compared to the \"expensive\" cities in the US.\n\n[https://www.numbeo.com/property-investment/rankings.jsp](https://www.numbeo.com/property-investment/rankings.jsp)\n\nNYC is the highest at 194, with a ratio of 10.2.  Shanghai, a great counterpart to NYC, is number 1 with 46.6.  Feel free to pick different cities to compare.  Rural areas are a horrible way to try to compare the 2 countries because China will not even give data on it, let alone reliable data.\n\nBonus for people in the US, if you buy a house, you get it.  Sometimes in China you buy a house and the developer doesn't finish it and after waiting for a few years you find they have stopped construction and are not even planning to resume.  Then, when you finally get them to claim to resume, you find out they just pay people for a few days to pretend to resume construction.  Meanwhile, you're still forced to pay the mortgage on the house you purchased that doesn't even exist.\n\n>find me one American who isn’t silver spoon fed under thirty that has something similar? No? My point.\n\nSo...you don't have a point, you just want to cry about how things are so much worse in the US and just make up some sort of really weird argument that has nothing to do with data or evidence?  I mean you're basically trying to say debunk anecdotal evidence with other anecdotal evidence, it makes no sense.\n\nHow about you focus really hard on the data, like what I linked, and explain to me how you can claim housing is more affordable in China than the US.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Are you forgetting the title of the original post?
