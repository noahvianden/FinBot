That way you won't get creamed if it does print 17.5 or 17. And since it's not a stock, you can even buy it back at that price, unlike the VIXY.

I trade them as if I was buying shares and selling CCs on them. So I won't open a PMCC spread and close it weeks later. It is a long term play on companies I want to own long term. And I actually typically open my first shorts as a calendar, not diagonal.\n\nWhy don't I just own the shares? Leverage on the long and a higher ROI on the shorts. This is where I'm most comfortable at with my risk tolerance.\n\nBut what about risk on the long? That's why I stick to leaps which are at less risk to short term volatility. Longest DTE possible, but may buy 2nd longest depending on liquidity. Hedge the account with other assets. Not a good idea to do PMCC with anything other than leaps. Some argue that they should be ITM. I disagree. Be patient with buying leaps and don't let the MMs make too much on the liquidity premium.\n\n>Can you give and example?\n\nSure. In December I bought RKLB 5c leaps both dated to 24 and 25 after it's fall from above $5 for an avg price of about 1.7. I sold Jan 5c in December shortly before the dip at an avg price of .17. During the dip (which I was down overall) I bought more leaps at the 5c using the short income and reduced my cost basis. Just this past week I closed those shorts as I saw the rally happening for about 0.03. So within a span of about a month I made 0.14 from a 1.7 investment, nearly 8% ROI in 1 month. I pretty much rolled that into shorting feb 5cs for an average of .22, well above my 10% ROI/month goal!\n\nRight now those shorts are down over 100% since I sold them (mark at 0.525), but I keep an eye on the greeks and made sure delta is positive so I am still overall positive despite my shorts being underwater. However, it's in the danger zone and I am heavily exposed to negative gamma and may need some action to take so that this trade doesn't go sour. But I love PMCCs, because there are so many ways to manage your position because you have soooo much time between the long and short. So despite me being in the danger zone, I'm not worried because time is on my side and I have a few ideas of how to manage this. The long term plan is to open diagonal spreads as the underlying increases.\n\n>What happens when the market drops and you‚Äôre selling calls below or close to your original long strike? Does it turn into a debit calendar spread?\n\nEven though I open with calendar spreads, there's a few things you can do if the underlying goes down below your ability open shorts. Buy more leaps at a lower strike, have a calendar/diagonal put spread making a disfigured form of an IC to hedge, or roll your leap calls down to a lower strike. Yeah you'll lose on the roll, but that'll mostly appreciate back if the underlying revives and it's better to make income with shorts while you wait instead of just sitting on decaying leaps. But I would save the roll down unless you think the stock will stay down. Time is on your side with this trade. Honestly, I could keep this trade going for decades with rolling and I will make money as long as time goes by (I'm theta positive) and the underlying doesn't deviate too far against my overall exposure, which I can easily change depending on my outlook.\n\nA big goal for a PMCC is to sell enough shorts over time to cover your initial leap cost. It is *doable* with proper management and the right amount of luck. See my above ROI.\n\nIf you are interested in how I will manage my trade as it's in the danger zone rn, feel free to pm me to see what I'll do in the coming month.\n\nMind you, my strategy is much more risky than what theta gang would typically approve of. The general consensus here seems to be long ITM leap with a delta of 0.7 and short 45 DTE with a delta of no more than 0.3 and best at 0.2. Much less risky, but much less profitable.
