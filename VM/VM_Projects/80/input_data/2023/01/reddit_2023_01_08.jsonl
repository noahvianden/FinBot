{"title": "Markets RIP on Friday w/ net options sentiment shifting to the upside. Gamma squeeze incoming?", "selftext": "Markets closed Friday with a sharp rip to the upside. Call option activity and net option sentiment has been slowly increasing and making a major shift into positive territory.\n\nThe market (SPY) has been in a tight range for the last 6 weeks with the light volume over the holidays. In regards to the QQQ, but also the general market, there are two things I am looking at:\n\n* The market has been range-bound for roughly 6 weeks with no clear direction.\n* We are back at the June 2021 lows, nearly 7 months of no returns.\n\nI’ve market both levels on the chart below.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i1ri1jwcntaa1.png?width=2464&format=png&auto=webp&s=30557e850b489da111515be1bc63c383acffb719\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis leads me to believe the charts are suggesting a short-term bottom and an entry with a favorable risk-reward may be approaching, depending on your time-frame of course.\n\nFurthermore, there’s an increase in net positive option buying that’s been going on under the hood of the market. [Chart courtesy of the Prospero App.](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/prospero-ai/id1529837512)\n\n*Processing img ibd9fx58xtaa1...*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe SPY average net options sentiment values have been steadily climbing since December. This comes after the large drop that occurred going into the holiday break.\n\nSimilarly, the QQQ was not too far off from the SPY which also showed a steady increase (although more volatile) in [net options sentiment activity.](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/prospero-ai/id1529837512)\n\n*Processing img 5hwlpe59xtaa1...*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nChina stocks have been hammered and BABA was another name showing similar patterns of increasing options positioning, this time to the upside. Here's a look at the longer time-frame from back in October when the share price also happened to bottom at -75% from the high. Net buyers of options have been able to push the share price up nearly 55% since then.\n\n*Processing img r7ra1ydaxtaa1...*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLastly, a look at retail’s favorite stock, Tesla. The share price is down 70% from the highs and retail has been getting hammered on this name over the last 6 months. Positive options sentiment reaching near the top of the charts with the stock nearing the lows.\n\n*Processing img yvhv1jdbxtaa1...*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn my opinion once the sellers have stopped and liquidity dries up we may be seeing some sharp moves upward. This will also come at the expense of more volatility (low liquidity), but makes me wonder if the big players are setting themselves up for the market to squeeze higher.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat do you guys think?", "id": "106jpvr", "created_utc": 1673185841.0, "score": 171, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 77, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 61, "replies": [{"body": "If you are out....means she is going to boom!", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Exactly.

Whether measured by the consumer-price index, or CPI, which most people watch, or the price index for personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, which the Federal Reserve prefers, the annualized inflation rate has been around 2.5% over these five months.\n\nYes, you read that right. Yet hardly anyone has noticed this stunning development because of the near-universal concentration on price changes measured over 12-month periods, which are still 7.1% for CPI inflation and 5.5% for PCE inflation.\n\nNormally, focusing on 12-month inflation rates is the right thing to do, for two main reasons. First, it guards against hyperventilation over “blips” in the inflation data, whether up or down. Second, it obviates the need for seasonal adjustment, since, for example, you are comparing prices in November 2022 with those in November 2021.\n\nBut when the inflation rate changes abruptly, 12-month averages can leave you watching recent history rather than current events.
