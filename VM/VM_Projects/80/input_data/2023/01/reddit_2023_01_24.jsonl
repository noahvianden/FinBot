A separate structure is more consistent with a traditional solvent wet process needing significant drying and special environmental conditioning or sealing.\n\nthis is all speculation until we have confirmed word.\n\ni agree that their cell processing will get better. And so will Panasonic’s CATLs and everyone else’s.\n\nCompared to LICE automakers, Tesla has a tremendous advantage that they can design semiconductors and write software well, and legacy automakers can’t. \n\nBut in battery cells they are newcomers (pack management is state of art), competing with specialist companies with deep experience in this as a core capability.\n\nLong term I am very impressed with CATLs new LFMP chemistry, boosting LFP performance with cheap manganese.
