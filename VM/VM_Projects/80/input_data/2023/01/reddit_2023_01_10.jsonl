Whoever thinks the Fed is going to keep rates at 5% or more through 2024 is simply not paying attention.

Only 6 months later and we are ALREADY to be projected 6.5 CPI. At that rate we will be around 4 CPI summer of 2023 and sub 3.5% by end of 2023. The Fed can not justify holding rates throughout 2024. \n\n2) CONGRESS. alot of guys simply forget how \"america system works.\" The Fed claims that they are \"independent.\" But we all know CONGRESS controls the fed. Once CPI starts to get even lower; Powell and crew will start to get \"phone calls\" from both REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS to lower the rates. Repubs want lower rates to spur economic growth for businesses. The Dems want lower rates to be able to help fund social agendas etc etc. CONGRESS WILL FORCE FED TO PAUSE AND PIVOT as CPI comes down......ESPECIALLY IF JOB LOSS IS WIDE SPREAD.\n\nAnd finally:\n\n3) The fed has a HORRIBLE TRACK RECORD of keeping their word. They first said inflation was transitory and that they were not going to raise past 0.25 bps.\n..........15 months later we are at 4.25%.
