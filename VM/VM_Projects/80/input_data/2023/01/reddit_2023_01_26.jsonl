{"title": "Cautiously bullish… 1-26-23 SPY/ ES Futures and Tesla Daily Market Analysis", "selftext": "Yet another day of a sell off followed by huge EOD push. Today when you step back actually reminded me a lot of last week. We had some choppy/ rangy sell off like movement at open and then throughout the EOD we just slow trended green the rest of the day. \n\nTrading the last 2-3 weeks really does remind me of early 2022/ late 2021. I sincerely hope that we continue trading like this for the rest of the year. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gfw5mphh3hea1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=db03ec622e4410c0ae4e6fc9ff4f20ce2c95d53f\n\nThat thick red resistance line that we broke through pre market is the last resistance line for the bears… with bulls breaking through and closing over that we have effectively 100% from a technical analysis stand point broken the bear market trend. However, we are still by definition in a bear market until we break through 417.74. \n\nCurrently we are in a large blue bull channel with a large rising wedge forming here. \n\nOne thing that I am concerned about here is that 405.3 is a major channel level that SPY has spent lots of time interacting with previous. Bulls are going to need a hard close over it tomorrow with a bigger green day in order to continue this rally. While I have been bullish and remain bullish until FOMC next week.. this 405.2 and 409/410 levels that we are coming upon here are two very big levels that could provide a potential top for us. \n\nMy ultimate target remains $410 which we are now $5.25 from which could easily be achieved tomorrow… However, I recognize the potential for a rejection at 405.3 and a retest of 400 support. \n\nBulls want to close the week OVER 408.8 and bears want to close the week UNDER 405.3 (preferably under 400). \n\nKey SPY support- 403.1 -> 400.3 -> 398.9 \n\nKey SPY resistance- 405.3 -> 407 -> 410.3\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aku8wyzh3hea1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=9070c5aeefe23fc2e5b137f63db9afab6df290e5\n\nTaking a look at futures here we back tested and held key 4030 support, bullishly engulfed the previous candle and 4055 are finally broken and closed over. That 4055 is a key resistance from the December CPI high. \n\nWe now are establishing a new level today at 4070 also. \n\nFutures has NOT broken through its weekly or daily bear market resistance line which tomorrow will sit at 4101 on the daily and 4105 on the weekly. \n\nWe are also coming in on a key resistance level of 4095. This is a major pivot level much like 3910/ 390.1 for Spy. \n\nKey Futures Support- 4070 -> 4055 -> 4030  \n Key Futures Resistance- 4082 -> 4095 -> 4130\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3cb6enqi3hea1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=568974f251bc95c496193cc8cede6d9dee4ed453\n\nI did short Tesla at open due to the 159.8 rejection and sell off. However it was a very short lived sell off as Tesla came down and nicely held 155 support area. \n\nTesla is now trading… with the help of a massive gap up.. over the daily 50ema for the first time since September. \n\nI remain extremely cautious of Tesla and how much it has ran up here and how fast. We have broke over the resistance of that bull channel and that usually is a good sign to short. We also have a massive 10% gap to fill at some point. I did almost take a 30dte put on Tesla EOD today… but I see a case for us to hit 176 first. Bulls want to close Tesla over 163.8 tomororw and realistically bears want to close it under 150 if not lower. \n\nKey Tesla Support- 159.9 -> 154.1 -> 149.9 -> 146\n\nKey Tesla Resistance- 167.9 -> 175\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j3upmfvj3hea1.png?width=635&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a42169d94376ec39db65cd434a703fc92f0c801\n\nNot much to say about the VIX besides it continues to unwind and has now retaken the 18s. The VIX will look to revisit the 17s again in the near future at this rate. \n\n**Daily log-**\n\nOverall another great trading day and another great week of trading. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xqokz1bk3hea1.png?width=816&format=png&auto=webp&s=1fcce3e1ab594e46b2c79aabef36c8c8e82c93ec\n\nI know I have been saying that the last two weeks has been some of the best trading mentally and profit wise in a very long time. I have thought about this a lot and talked to others about this. \n\nIt makes me reflect back to my core trading style. Scalps were never my core style. I never used to trade 10 second long scalps. However, I had to adapt, improvise and overcome this 2022 bear market that was chewing up and spitting us out. Primarily I am a momentum trader and I used to prefer longer dte trades. Find a trend and ride the EMAs out. This trading that has been happening for the last two weeks reminds me a lot of early 2022 and 2021. The morning is volatile and all over the place and then from there we establish a trend and ride the EMA wave up. \n\nWe have officially… for now… returned to that style. I have learned this by realizing what indicators I do and don’t look at to take trades. I use to aggressively focus on VOLD, DMI, Moneyflow and price action. Now I find myself mainly focusing on physical price action, ORB levels and volatility. \n\nThe best thing a trade can do is to learn to adapt to the ever changing markets. Having more than one successful strategy depending on the current market conditions can and will prove to allow you to be profitable no matter the market.", "id": "10m61pt", "created_utc": 1674776062.0, "score": 74, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 90, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|10|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|4109|**Previous Best DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/10bc8s6/are_the_bulls_or_bears_in_control_11323_spy_es/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/109jd7z/cpi_prediction_and_analysis_11123_spy_and_tesla/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/zxm2pi/is_the_santa_rally_over_122822_spy_es_futures_and/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/zhbkpu/12922_spy_weekly_market_analysis_and_recap_plus/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/107r60k/the_fake_breakout_1923_spy_es_futures_and_tesla/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/vwhw7o/how_to_trade_cpi_day/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/v8vbnd/6922_spy_daily_ta_bonus_cpi_day_trade_breakdown/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/zazoex/is_the_bottom_in_or_is_the_next_top_in_12222_spy/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xsd18z/93022_spy_es_futures_apple_and_tesla_weekly_recap/) \n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\n ^^[**Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse) ^^[BanBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/banbets/)  ^^VoteBot ^^[FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/votebot/) ^^[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/leaderboard/) ^^- ^^[**Keep_VM_Alive**](https://www.patreon.com/visualmod)\n\nHey /u/DaddyDersch, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.\n>TL;DR: I have realized that I have returned to my old trading style and indicators.
