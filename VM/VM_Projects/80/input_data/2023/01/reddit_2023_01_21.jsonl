Max loss on spreads is normally the width of the spread, minus credit received, times number of contracts and contract multiplier.

(7.5-1)*(10*100)=6500 max loss. \n\nBUT…. OP is pinned. His long call expired worthless and is now gone.  His short went ITM after hours so he’ll likely be short 100 shares come Monday (he should find that out tomorrow morning). His long call no longer offers protection so max loss becomes infinite. If nflx gaps up 100 points come Monday OP would be down $100,000. Mind you a 100 point gap up is highly unlikely, but nflx did drop over 100 points last earnings, so it’s possible. \n\nSo sizing is important that OP didn’t max out their buying power based on a max loss of <7.5 per contract. They could be in a world of hurt if they did. \n\nI included the crisis number because there was a story of a trader who committed suicide thinking he lost 750k from being pinned.
