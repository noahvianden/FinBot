Generally (not everytime), when spy is up tsla will be up more than the spy. Maybe 2x of that of spy or maybe a bit less. So when spy is down you will be more down than the SPY. What that then means is owning 1 stock of tsla is a bit like owning 2 stocks of SPY. Lets say that one tsla stock is worth 130$, your delta dollars is 130 (because they are delta with relation to the actual stock), But your beta weighted delta dollars are 260$(because tsla has beta of 2). Also, your portfolio beta weighted delta is 2. Now lets say you buy one stock of SARK (which is inverse of Arkk), and let's say SARK has a negative beta (its inversely correlated to spy ) of 2. Also lets say one stock of SARK is worth same as TSLA , $130. So when you buy one stock of TSLA and SARK , your beta weighted delta is 0. Which means technically you are not affected either by market going up or down. If you are buying options, the logic works in the similar way since an option is tied to an underlying which has the beta w.r.t to SPY. Of course options will have a leverage factor. There is also the concept of equal weighting your portfolio, which is useful when the whole market goes up or down (so the beta correlations don't hold ) . There are days when this will happen, but statistically beta weighting will work more often than not.  To put it in summary, whenever you plan to buy or sell something, you look at what impact that has to your overall portfolio and based on your thesis work towards balancing it. So if you expect a massive bull run, load up on as much beta as you can. Make sure your beta weighted delta is as high as possible.
