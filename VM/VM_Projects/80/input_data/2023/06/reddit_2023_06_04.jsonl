{"title": "How to profit off AI rally (hint it's not in tech) and why the rally might not be over.", "selftext": "**How to profit off the AI rally:**\n\nTo put it simply, to make money off the AI rally you take big positions in other sectors so that when institutions rotate gains out of tech, you benefit from the shift.  As institutions are dumping their tech bags, you gotta look for where they're going next and get in with them. Look for high volume buying or accumulation in sectors that are beaten down. but these types of plays mean you might have to sit a while b4 you experience any gains. If you want quicker gains or lottos, you can see which other sectors have high volume buying pressure and take lottos (weeklies) early on those if you wanna gamble. But LEAPS is what I'm mostly talking about.\n\n**Shorting tech might not be a good idea:**\n\nI wouldn't short tech unless you have a good thesis or see heavy institutional selling. Institutions will let the rally go as high as retail is willing to pay. Then they enter the distribution phase and begin dumping shares. Shorting pullbacks on a rally isn't smart because it takes many small rallies for institutions to unload bags on retail. Sell offs can bounce back easily because institutions simply stop selling and then they let retail run the price back up off the dip. That way institutions can keep unloading at their target price.\n\nImagine institutions dump 1/4 of their positions. Tech sells off. Bears think it's crash. Institutions stop selling and selling pressure goes away (they drive the selling pressure). Then with institutional selling pressure gone, retail dip buyers bring the price back up to institution's price target where they dump another 1/4 of their shares. So on and so forth before they finally unload the last of their position and then tech goes into free fall.\n\nHere’s a chart I made to explain. Red line is institutional selling pressure. Green line is retail buying dip (no institutional selling meaning limited supply meaning demand drives price up).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/847mnl09k14b1.png?width=1232&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=42868f9a2aae685bf2e81d3fa84583ac32f75f22\n\n**Why tech might keep going up:**\n\nThis is just a generalization. Even with these factors driving market structure, the overall market and even tech may still trend higher for a while. This is because the concentration of the market’s rally is in tech, and as money rotates into other sectors we may see the rest of the market rise. Retail may see the market rise (as a result of lagging sectors rising), and think “market go up, me keep investing in tech”. Institutions also know this broadening of market gains will create psychological demand in their customers (the retail they sell their stocks to), and may have tech bags they’re willing to dump even higher than the current “top” of tech. And by the way, I wouldn't be investing in tech personally after this really even though it may still rise.\n\n**Market is an auction and why this matters:**\n\nBut you might say “hurr durr economy doing bad” blah blah blah like yeah I know. Everybody knows. The market is an auction, though. It has everything to do with what is the highest price that people will pay for the stocks that institutions are holding.\n\nIf the movement and flow of institutional money is creating bullish signals in the market, the public will sense that pressure to buy regardless of their trading knowledge and be willing to pay higher and higher prices for stocks. The movement of institutional money affects prices and when people see prices move they fomo into the market. Demand goes up because people don’t want to miss out. They don’t understand the market.\n\nThe news cycle, economic woes, and war has scared retail into selling their shares dirt cheap to institutions, and the public has been waiting to get back in. What happens when the public all wants to get in at once? Demand soars and prices of stocks soar because people want in. It becomes impossible to get in the market at a good price for retail because they all want in at once (limited supply since institutions control supply and aren’t selling). If there is public demand, institutions who control the supply can determine at which point they will provide the product. If institutions chose to not unload their bags, there will be limited supply to meet the new influx of high demand. This drives the price up to the institution's price targets at which point they begin distribution.\n\nThis is why stock prices can go up even if it doesn't make sense.\n\nLong story short, the news cycle is only good for trying to guess whether institutions are going to try and accumulate (buy low) or distribute (sell high) their product (stocks) to customers (retail).\n\n**TL;DR:** If you’re going to short tech, know that you are going against the trend and you’ll be lucky if you short into a pullback. If you want to make gains buy LEAPs on underperforming sectors that have institutions rotating into them. You may have to sit on those LEAPs a long time because prices may fluctuate in those sectors until institutions have finished accumulating. If you want to lotto, maybe find sectors that are STARTING to rally on high volume after any kind of sell off in tech and gamble there.\n\nEdit: ppl asking what sector I'm watching, banking.", "id": "140l6qc", "created_utc": 1685902253.0, "score": 98, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 82, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|5|**First Seen In WSB**|8 months ago\n**Total Comments**|745|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|9 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n>TL;DR: To make money off the AI rally you take big positions in other sectors so that when institutions rotate gains out of tech.
