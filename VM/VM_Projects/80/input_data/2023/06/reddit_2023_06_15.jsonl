{"title": "How to make big gains on ADBE earnings tonight", "selftext": "Photoshop software owner Adobe (ADBE) is scheduled to announce Q2 earnings results on Thursday, June 15th, after market close. They are a SaaS company, SaaS stands for \"Software as a service.\" A software distribution model in which a cloud provider hosts applications and makes them available to end users over the internet. We're going to be going over this in detail later. Like many other cloud-based businesses powered by AI, is poised to generate substantial cash flows in the future. Particularly, Adobe's market is expected to grow at a pace of 13% until 2030. \n\nThe consensus EPS estimate is $3.79, with total revenues between $4.75 billion and $4.78 billion. The consensus mark for the same is pegged at $4.76 billion, implying growth of 8.6% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s reported figure.\n\nAccording to seeking alpha: \n\n* Over the last 2 years, ADBE has beaten EPS estimates 100% of the time and has beaten revenue estimates 88% of the time.\n\n* Over the last 3 months, EPS estimates have seen 19 upward revisions and 4 downward. \n\n* Revenue estimates have seen 15 upward revisions and 7 downward.\n\nThe company on March 15 reported Q1 Non-GAAP EPS of $3.80, ahead of estimates by 12 cents. Revenue of $4.66 billion was up 9.4% from a year ago and topped analyst expectations by at least $40 million.\n\n**Important Factors**\n\nAdobe’s strong focus on its Digital Media business is likely to have aided its performance in the fiscal second quarter. Growing demand for ADBE’s Digital Media Solutions, along with solid momentum across Creative Cloud and Document Cloud, is expected to have benefited the Digital Media business in the to-be-reported fiscal quarter. For second-quarter fiscal 2023, Adobe expects Digital Media revenues between $3.45-$3.47 billion.\n\n[Vladimir Dimitrov](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/vladimir-p-dimitrov-cfa-aa754932?trk=public_post_feed-actor-name), leader of the \"The Roundabout Investor\" Investing Group, wrote in a recent analysis, \"The set-up for Adobe's share price remains favourable at least in the short-run. With the narrative around generative AI gaining momentum and sell-side analysts still catching-up, ADBE could continue to outperform the broader market in the coming weeks and even months. \n\nThe rising demand for Photoshop, Lightroom and Premier Pro and solid momentum across the Adobe Express platform might have contributed well to the performance of Creative Cloud. Further, solid enterprise adoption of Acrobat and Adobe Sign is expected to have driven growth in Document Cloud revenues in the to-be-reported fiscal quarter.\n\nApart from Digital Media, strong momentum across Adobe Experience Cloud, on the heels of the rising uptake of Adobe Marketing Cloud, Adobe Analytics Cloud and Adobe Advertising Cloud, is expected to have boosted the business in the fiscal second quarter. Moreover, strength in Workfront might have been another positive.\n\nADBE expects the Digital Experience segment’s revenues to grow 13% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s actuals. Also, Digital Experience subscription revenues are expected between $1.21 billion and $1.23 billion. Additionally, strong momentum in applications like Real-Time CDP and Adobe Journey Optimizer is likely to have been a tailwind.\n\n**Long Term Gains?**\n\nThe SaaS market is highly competitive, especially when compared to the overall Cloud Market, which is dominated by Amazon (AMZN). However, in the SaaS market, no single company holds a market share larger than 25%. This presents a significant advantage for all the companies operating in the SaaS market, as they can continue to grow without concerns about anti-monopoly laws that might put them in direct conflict with the U.S. Government.\n\nAmong the key players in the SaaS market are Salesforce (CRM), Adobe, Microsoft (MSFT), SAP SE (SAP), Oracle (ORCL), International Business Machines (IBM), ServiceNow (NOW), and Workday (WDAY). With a market share of 12.50%, [Adobe currently stands as the second-largest SaaS company, trailing behind Salesforce.](https://i.ibb.co/syLN2fb/EORPpAo.png)\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Adobe delivers its products through the SaaS model. It is projected that the SaaS market will reach a valuation of $149 billion by 2030, with an estimated revenue of $321.6 billion in 2026. The SaaS market can be categorized [into three segments](https://wetelo.com/blog/digitalization/global-saas-market-size-detailed-analysis): Business & Productivity, Transportation & Logistics, and Circular Economy. As evident, Adobe primarily focuses on the Business & Productivity segment. This specific segment is what's going to be reaching a valuation of $149B by 2030. \n\nSince 2018, [Adobe has experienced](https://i.ibb.co/php2nPr/EORPpAo.png) a remarkable revenue growth of 98%, corresponding to an annual growth rate of 16%. Additionally, its operating income has seen a significant increase of 112%, representing an annual growth rate of 18%. The majority of Adobe's revenue is derived from its [Subscription Revenue](https://i.ibb.co/M9Mk6jZ/MA7ypFK.png), accounting for 96% of the total revenue. As evident, Adobe heavily relies on subscriptions, thus necessitating continuous efforts to maintain its reputation and drive innovation in order to stay ahead of the competition.\n\nWhen it comes to operations, Adobe operates in a market that is already characterized by low capital intensity. Over the years, Adobe has consistently improved its [efficiency ratio](https://i.ibb.co/bRT3Bnv/EORPpAo.png). Moving on to the Balance Sheet section, we can see that Adobe has maintained a relatively healthy financial position. Despite numerous acquisitions, Adobe has managed to keep its [debt level relatively stable](https://i.ibb.co/BBT1K94/MA7ypFK.png). Their cash reserves experienced a staggering 172% increase from 2018 to 2020, and have since remained relatively stable, currently standing at $4.072 billion. Moving on to current assets and liabilities, [look at how](https://i.ibb.co/CztwNRp/MA7ypFK.png) Adobe successfully reduced its current liabilities following the acquisition last year.\n\nOverall Adobe is committed to expansion while maintaining its financial health. They prioritize reinvesting a certain amount of money back into the business whenever it exceeds a predetermined threshold.\n\n**Will they mention AI during Earnings?**\n\nAdobe is focusing on generative AI, introducing features like Firefly and [Generative Fill](https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2023/05/23/future-of-photoshop-powered-by-adobe-firefly) to enhance its product offerings and user experience. According to the [Adobe Blog](https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2023/05/10/adobe-firefly-adobe-express-google-bard), Firefly's launch in March marked one of the most successful beta launches in the history, generating over 70 million images within the first month. This AI-driven tool relies on a model that leverages hundreds of millions of photos, allowing it to generate both images and text effects based on provided descriptions. In [MoffettNathanson's Inaugural Technology, Media, and Telecom Conference](https://www.ibm.com/investor/events/svb-moffettnathanson-technology-media-and-telecom-conference), the management stated:\n\n> \"If you're Nike, for example, what are you going to want your teams to use? You're going to want them to use a commercially viable model that was trained in the right way, which you can talk about Firefly, plus all the assets that Nike has, right, that hopefully are stored in Creative Cloud or in our AEM system.\"\n\nTherefore, with a focus on incorporating AI into Adobe's products and services, it's easy to believe that Firefly will consist of multiple AI models in the future that will serve various use cases. This is particularly relevant in today's self-media-driven society, including millions of business owners and influencers on TikTok and YouTube Shorts, where the demand for such capabilities is rapidly growing.\n\nAdditionally, I think what makes Firefly stand out from other generative AI tools is its distinctive feature. Firefly will provide the capability to generate images that are safe for commercial use, without infringing on copyrighted materials. The management continued:\n\n> \"They wanted to be a commercially viable asset that has -- we have kind of credentials that can show that it can be used. If they want to sell it or if they want to put it on and have it being add on Instagram or whatever else, there are signals in the market that the commercial viability of assets is going to matter, just like you can't use a copyrighted image on Google necessarily on Instagram.\"\n\nIt's simple to see a comparative advantage for this functionality in the future if Firefly is able to produce copyright-free images that may be utilised directly in ongoing projects with efficiency. Firefly may be used as a time-effective AI tool, enabling users to train and enhance models using their own material, in response to the growing need for AI skills from people and businesses.\n\nIn addition to this, the company's partnership with Google's Bard expands Firefly's reach and potential for increased user engagement. So there's no reason why they wouldn't mention AI at least a hundred times. Users will be able to continue their creative journey seamlessly in Adobe Express. Firefly will enhance and showcase text-to-image capabilities within Bard, allowing users of all skill levels to describe their creative ideas using their own words and generate Firefly images directly within Bard. I believe this integration differentiates Firefly from other generative AI tools in the market, which offers users a more intuitive creative experience.\n\nThe company has demonstrated its dedication to embracing generative AI and fostering creativity among artists and content creators. Generative Fill, powered by Firefly in Photoshop (beta), will be available to the public in 2H CY2023. I think all these AI features will add value to their service, and can even be treated as a standalone subscription model. Despite a recent 32% rally due to the AI optimism, the stock is currently trading at 32x P/E TTM, which is lower than the 5-year average of 40x. Therefore, I'm bullish on ADBE.\n\n**What to do for Earnings?**\n\nGiven Adobe's [previous track record of beating consensus projections for its quarterly results](https://i.ibb.co/Mn1mnVH/EORPpAo.png), it wouldn't be surprising if the firm once again exceeded them. This, along with the compelling AI storyline, might result in a significant reaction in the company's share price. Contracts are expensive so I'll be getting a call spread. I'll be buying the 6/16 500c for a whopping $1400, and selling the 520c for $830. This means I can get the call spread for $570, offering a maximum gain of 3.6x if the stock moves up 6% - which is the average move with earnings.

{"title": "This isn’t a bubble it’s a revolution, like the industrial revolution, just on a grand scale.", "selftext": "The Dot Com bubble burst because the internet and the infrastructure were not ready and capable of supporting the companies going public at a rapid pace. During the Dot Com era dial up was the primary internet. Most homes didn’t have a computer or cell phones and Robinhood didn’t exist. Today we have fiber optic internet. More information on the internet than a person can read in one lifetime. You can order food to your doorstep or be the driver delivering the food. Get anything you want, when you want it. If the internet at the time was faster and the infrastructure was in place, the bust may never have happened.\n\nA primary driving factor of the bubble bursting was low interest rates from 1998–99 allowing LOTS of startups to open with cheap money/borrowing. We don’t have that now and AI is still thriving.\n\nMost companies that did go public had zero earnings or value just hoping to capitalize on the boom.\n\nThis isn’t the same. AI has been around for a while, for example IBM’s Watson, Apple’s SIRI, Amazon’s Alexa, the GPS reading the route instructions to you or Microsoft word checking your grammar and spelling on word documents. This is AI like it or not. We’ve gotten so used to them we don’t even think of them as AI. ChatGPT is just another tool in the toolbox and it still has a LONG way to go before its good.\n\nMost companies will take a while to implement AI as it has to be perfect when it’s released and people are trained to work with AI not for AI. For example when you order at Wendy’s and the AI bot can’t seem to get your order right, people need to be there to step in. Or when you reach out to your bank to get transaction details and the bot doesn’t understand, a person needs to be there.\n\nA lot of the existing companies on the front lines of the AI revolution (NVDA,Intel, AMD, etc.) are seasoned companies with a long history of revenue. AI development and integration into the economic system (Education, Industrial, Medical, Customer Service, Agriculture, Finance, Media, Transportation, etc) is a great source of growth for all these companies and it’s a great opportunity for new companies to emerge and make our lives easier.\n\nEveryone that has a job today can think of ATLEAST one way AI can improve what they do to make work easier.\n\nThis is the AI Revolution, The Artificial Intelligence Age, a new frontier.
