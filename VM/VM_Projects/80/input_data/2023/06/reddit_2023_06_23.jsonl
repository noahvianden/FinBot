The type of student debt that is under consideration for forgiveness often go to those with financial need. Just because they took student loans doesn’t mean they weren’t frugal. If you didn’t take student loans it’s not because you were frugal it’s because you either did not qualify due to you or your family earning too much or already had the means to pay for it through a nest egg from a donor which means they’ve financially benefited enough from society to help you. Either way college was “free” for you. Because you had someone pay for you, it would make sense that the government should pay for those who don’t have someone to pay for them. Hence the forgiveness. How does that reduce inflation? It doesn’t. It eases the burden of inflation on those it affects the most.\n\nFor example, high net worth individuals are less affected by inflation. They’re less affected by layoffs that happen due to inflation. They have the money to absorb price increases due to inflation. Meanwhile low income individuals are the most vulnerable to layoffs. No income source means no debt repayment. Credit card, mortgages, student loans, etc. Living becomes a nightmare. \n\nLastly high net worth individuals often are sheltered from losses and benefit directly from bailouts. They’ve gotten bailouts every time there was a recession. Meanwhile no one else gets bailouts. Covid was the first time main street got some form of bailout. Forgiving student loans would be the equivalent of bailing out some of main street over wall street. Even though you don’t have loans you should still be for it.
