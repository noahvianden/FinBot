I don't know if it's just that the middle class don't appreciate this so it isn't discussed on the news, but please remember that in the UK over 1/3 of the population is a retired boomer or claiming benefits and this number is increasing every year. These people have seen over a 10% increase in their income in the last year alone and couldn't give a crap what the BoE is doing with rates since they don't have mortgages.\n\nThese ever increasing benefits means government borrowing (and spending) is now at an all time high and will continue to increase. All of this borrowing in recent years has been great for the wealthy as they now get to earn interest on their cash thanks to higher rates and will continue see their asset prices increase (in nominal terms) as the government pumps inflation into the economy. Point is, counterintuitively a significant proportion of the UK population actually benefits from inflation and higher rates.\n\nThe squeeze the media keep talking about exists, but only for a small segment of the economy – mostly less wealthy younger middle class workers who must cope with both increased mortgage rates and higher taxation to pay for all the government spending. If you're a boomer, welfare recipient or the government, your spending will only increase in line with inflation largely offsetting any squeeze occurring elsewhere in the economy.\n\nThe bigger picture here is that I suspect we will need to cut government spending drastically or risk hyperinflation. Other western countries are in similar predicaments but in the UK our mix of high inflation, high taxation and excessive welfare spending (tracked to inflation) makes us much more vulnerable to this risk than other comparable nations.\n\nThose who think we can just increase taxes to pay down a deficit of this size are out of their minds. The government will continue to borrow more as they will continue to spend more on pensions, welfare and debt servicing costs. And more importantly, increasing tax will only slow GDP growth and has been shown repeatedly to not meaningfully increase government revenue – not to mention the fact that taxation is already the highest it's been in years in the UK. The issue here is spending, not tax. This is a key point.\n\nThis isn't a political statement, obviously in an ideal world I'd love more free stuff from the government too, but we need to get real. We cannot afford all of this stuff. State pensions need to be means tested – boomers can afford it. Health care needs to be means tested – again the boomers who are primary beneficiaries of the NHS can afford this. Welfare needs to be more targeted and more reasonable. I'd argue that even student loans should be given out more carefully as in many cases these drag on growth via increased indebtedness and lower worker participation. Most people I know with degrees work in retail and call centres.\n\nAnd for all the middle class people here who don't know what I'm talking about, there are several single mums in my family who have never worked in their lives yet have been given £20,000 cars, £500,000 homes and a £20,000 (tax-free) incomes by the government. If we want to tackle inflation and bring down house prices we need to end stupidity like this. The reports you see on the BBC of people on benefits struggling are cherry picked and rarely show the other side of the story.\n\nWe either stop the insanity on our terms or we have hyperinflation. Just my thoughts anyway. I'll note that most people I talk to disagree and believe the government should be doing more to help people with the cost of living. If the government would like to help me pay off my mortgage as some are suggesting they should I'll happily accept their help, but I don't think it's ideal for our economy.", "score": 94, "replies": [{"body": "The triple lock was a mistake.
