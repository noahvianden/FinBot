It’s called the business cycle. Read about it before you respond. Expansion occurs when rates are low and when there are people available to hire to drive growth. When you hit peak employment there’s no one left to hire to drive growth. What occurs is a wage-price spiral and inflation because companies have to compete with each other to retain and hire workers. Wages rise and prices rise as a result in a feedback loop. As a result the government has to cool off the labor market and raise rates which results in contraction. And the business cycle starts all over again. Now for you younger folks your view may be a little twisted due to the heavy manipulation of the economy since 2008. The Fed has propped up the economy and longest expansion in history with quantitative easing, ZIRP and corporate tax cuts. This is all being reversed. Rates are rising and the cost to borrow is with it. The Fed is also unwinding it’s balance sheet.

All he talked about was how the labor market was too hot and how they need to raise unemployment. Don't believe me. Actually watch it.\n\nAnd here's an article from the Federal Reserve of SF in the year 2000.\n\n[https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/economic-letter/2000/may/why-has-the-fed-been-raising-interest-rates/](https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/economic-letter/2000/may/why-has-the-fed-been-raising-interest-rates/)\n\nThey were raising rates in late 1999 and 2000 and the economy slowed and eventually entered a recession in early 2001. This was engineered by the Fed. Below is a direct quote from the Fed in 2000 discussing why they were raising rates. This is a discussion about wage-price spiral. Sounds eerily familiar to Powell's recent speeches.\n\n\"One consequence of the fast pace of growth since 1996 is that labor markets in the U.S. have now become very tight. With the unemployment rate currently at just under 4%, it’s no wonder we hear stories about how hard it is for some firms to find people to fill jobs. Labor markets as tight as this eventually can lead to faster increases in labor costs and therefore to higher price inflation than we’ve seen so far. In fact, we saw a noticeable jump in the first quarter employment cost index, a broad measure of labor compensation that includes wages, salaries, and benefits.\"\n\nWhether you want to believe it or not the Fed does not want unemployment below a certain level. And the actual percentage is perhaps not as important as the ratio of job openings to people looking for work. Which right now currently stands at 2-1.

I wasn't in on NVDA (congrats to all who were) because I don't know anything about AI, GPUs, wafers and so on.\n\nIn fact I don't know anything about anything that can make me money, apart from recognising FOMO. Which I did.\n\nI dipped my regarded toes in the water with $AI earnings, and 6x-ed what was sadly a smallish amount ($800). I then started looking for the next decent AI play and found ADBE, bought some $435c early this month. They dipped, I averaged down, and trying to be sensible I cashed out with a 5x (obviously could've been a lot more).\n\nI think I missed out on a couple of others (Oracle?) but the same thing predictably happened there I believe. \n\nNow I'm looking at upcoming AI earnings plays and the ones that stand out are $TSM in mid July and $INTC end of July. I've taken small positions (calls) in both but not much point yolo-ing yet as I'd just be paying for theta I don't need.\n\nAs far as I can tell, best way to profit from this madness is to buy calls expiring just after earnings with strike about 25% higher than current price, and do it about 7-10 days out from earnings. Then sell just before earnings or hold through earnings if confident. \n\nSo after having tasted the sweet nectar of success without gorging myself, I now have a couple of weeks to decide how much of my portfolio to spunk on these plays. Obviously the part of my monkey brain that likes instant gratification is telling me I've found a short term money glitch and I should YOLO into TSM then parlay into INTC, 8x them both, and then never trade again. I'm finding it hard to disagree.\n\nThe only way they can go tits up is a huge general market crash in the week or so between buying and selling, or a Chinese invasion of Taiwan (which would kill TSM but actually moon INTC).
