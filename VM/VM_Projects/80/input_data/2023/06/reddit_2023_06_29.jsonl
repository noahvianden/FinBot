Line 2 is the slope which shows the rate that it falls from the top. Copy this slope and apply it to today for line 3. The point where it intersects line 1 is when it stops going down. Draw horizontal line 4 from here and you can see the price is close to 320. Draw vertical line 5 and note that time is close to end of 2023.\n\nThe reason it goes down is because all the AI and quantum computers and everything that you can think of is already priced in. To make max profits we should be buying close to $320 puts expiring in 2024 and sell when it reaches 320.
