They’re posting all these other specs, even pointless ones like 0-60 in 5 sec.  Weight of the truck is a massively important figure for carriers. \n\nIt’s also the crux to Bill Gates opinion.  If you look at the actual quote Gates said, he has a valid point:\n\n“The problem is that batteries are big and heavy…. electric vehicles will probably never be a practical solution for things like 18-wheelers, cargo ships, and passenger jets. Electricity works when you need to cover short distances…”\n\nAnd he’s right.  More range means more batteries/weight, and that’s less cargo moved per trip.  It makes them ineffectual for long range.  That’s why legacy manufacturer Class 8 trucks only have a range of 200-300 miles…  To keep truck weight down.  And those EV day cabs weigh more than the OTR 587 Petes in my fleet (72” sleeper, 300 gal capacity, 2000+mile range, tractor weight is about 20k lbs).  \n\nIt I were to estimate the weight of the 500 mile range Tesla Semi, I’d guess it’s north of 28 lbs, maybe even 30k+.  That’s heavy AF for a day cab; and that doesn’t include the empty trailer.  \n\nMy empty 53’ Utility dry vans weigh around 13k lbs.  This puts the empty combo weight of my tractor trailers at around 33k lbs.  And that lines up with the hundreds of ANB/Pepsi/Coke BOLs and scale tickets I have that show each trip moved 46k-47k of cargo.   If my trucks were set up as day cabs, they’d weigh 3k-5k less; so they’d likely have a legal payload of 50k+ lbs.  \n\nGranted, EV semis can gross an extra 2k lbs, but the legacy manufacturer EVs typically weigh about 5k more than my OTR trucks (around 25k+).  Those EVs are already hauling less tonnage than their ICE counterparts per trip.  How much weight is Tesla’s extra 200-250 mile range add?  Could possibly calculate it based on Tesla battery figures and estimated kWh capacity, and it ends up being a few thousand pounds.\n\nAnd that’s why Gate’s statement rings true.  He was talking about long haul freight.  400 miles and less is considered in the industry to be “short” haul.

The quote is from the author, not NACFE (the source of info).  That quote is also prefaced in the same sentence with “NACFE didn’t specify the payload for this particular day”…  demonstrating that the “70,000 lbs” is not cargo/Payload.\n\nFurthermore, your ICE mpg and fuel costs are waaay off.  The current diesel National PUMP average is $4.56 and $0.35-0.60 of it is taxes that get counted towards IFTA road use taxes.  The quarterly IFTA taxes have to get paid regardless if it’s ICE or EV, and carriers don’t attribute those fuel taxes to fuel cost.  Plus, corporations with hubs don’t pay pump prices.  They buy in bulk and have their own fuel islands on site.  Bulk diesel prices currently average about $3/gal.\n\nThe average MPG of a loaded day cab is over double your quote; around 9-11 mpg.  This means for 1000 miles, it would cost $300 in fuel; or $0.30 a mile.  Driver wages are typically about double that, or $0.60 a mile.\n\nAnd you’re missing a massive variable: number of loads in that 1000 miles.  The EV that managed to do 1000 miles in one day hauled 4 loads.  Even being generous and saying it was grossed out on weight, at most it moved 160,000 lbs 1000 miles.  An ICE day cab would move over 200,000 lbs in the same time frame (1 day, 24 hours).  That’s 40k lbs more a day.\n\nIOW, it’s not “$1000 for 10,000 lbs of cargo”.  It’s $300 in fuel to move 200,000 lbs with an ICE truck.\n\nBut don’t forget charging cost of the EV.  Tesla has stated they average 1.7 kWh per mile.  The National average commercial cost per kWh is $0.1252.  It cost $212 in electric to move 160,000 lbs.  To move 200,000 lbs, it would cost $265.\n\nSo $35 less means it’s cheaper, right?  Only in “fuel” costs.  Driver wages alone to make that extra trip would end up costing the company about $100-150 more overall. \n\nI’ve been saying for years, the battery tech isn’t there to make EV trucks viable for most loads.  I’ve said they’d work on short trips for loads that cube out (run out of space before running out of weight).  I’ve been around OTR trucks for over 4 decades and worked in the industry about 12 years.  I’ve been in charge of crunching the daily/mile cost numbers when it’s been time to buy $1,000,000 of new trucks.  I might know a thing or two.

The rate would need to suddenly fall off a cliff for electric trucks to not dominate long haul in the long run. \n\nFor shorter ranged trucks I don't see how ICE could possibly compete with such a huge difference in fuel costs. They've clearly designed them to be able to replace ICE trucks without sacrificing on driver efficiency (and even to enhance it). And unlike cars where owners might happily choose to pay more due to personal preferences no reasonable business is going to do that.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "It’s not goalpost moving when Gates specifically said it works for short distances.  \n\nThere’s major aspects detrimental to EVs in OTR truck that you don’t realize.  For instance, for years (over a decade) there hasn’t been enough parking spaces for semis in general.  It’s why you can routinely see them parked on on/off ramps at night.  It will take years to just get that parking situation taken care of.  It’s estimated there’s only 1 parking spot for every 11 trucks on the road.  \n\nThrow in the fact that then they’d also need chargers and the massive infrastructure to supply power, how long will that take.  Plus, the increased Wh/kg is great and all for increasing range, but that means each battery will need that much more power to charge.  The Tesla Semi with 500 mile range is estimated to have a 800-1000 kWh battery.  OTR trucks routinely do 600-700 a day with a single driver and 1400+ with a team.  Even with a “lowball” 1000 kWh for a OTR truck, many truck stops have enough parking for 100 trucks.  That’s a megawatt of power every night as a conservative estimate for each truck stop.  But then there’s huge truck stops like the Iowa 80 that has 900 parking spots.  This is just barely touching the problem with what it’s take to support EV OTR trucks even when the battery capability exists.  \n\nThe only reason anyone does it today is because it’s companies moving hub to hub freight where they have chargers present.  And that’s the only way it’d be “cheaper” than ICE too.  Look at any thread that brings up only using public chargers to charge their cars and the operating cost is typically the same or slightly less than a gas car.  With a semi, there is no “charge at home” option unless it’s a company truck at a company’s hub.   \n\nICE day cabs can compete because there’s more in the cost per mile than just fuel (which is still a significant part).  Things like driver wages and insurance make up a considerable portion.  The figures I listed above use very conservative weights for the EV tractors.  Because EV tractors are so heavy, they’re payload is 8k-10k lbs less than ICE competitors; even with the extra 2k lbs they’re allowed to gross.  It roughly means that 5 loads an ICE day cab can haul would take an EV truck 6 loads.  That’s extra time to pay the driver, extra time for the dock worker, and more wear on equipment to move the same amount of freight.  So when you say they “increase driver efficiency”, I don’t know what efficiency you’re referring to.\n\nPlus, down time is a massive loss.  It’s not just a matter of getting trucks into the shop, but having the parts available to fix them.  The more obscure the part, the more likely there will be long down time.  I’ve had a truck down for a month because a part wasn’t available.  That cost the company $10s of thousands.  \n\nThat’s why this Run On Less event is giving lots of detail on mileages and being extremely vague on weights.  They’re showing literal charts of miles driven during what hour of day on a few select standouts, but when it comes to actual loads, it’s “all the trucks combines have moved ____ lbs since the event began”.  \n\nI’m all for advancement and better equipment.

I feel like this is the major point of disagreement? You seem to think that fuel savings will be minimal when it's basically on the order of 50-70% off.

You’ll often see “delivery only” or “no truck parking” signs.  That doesn’t mean you can get away with parking there to run inside to buy stuff real quick.  \n\nThe diesel prices you see at the pump are inflated like mad; even at the gas station.  Most small companies use dedicated fuel cards like Fleetone, which gives some discount.  Then if you buy enough fuel at a particular truck stop company, they might offer you a discount; maybe 15-25 cents off, but you have to sign a contract that you’ll buy so much fuel there every month or they’ll fine you.  Large carriers can leverage massive discounts; often $0.50+ discount per gallon (I’ve heard as high as $1+ off) from the truck stop alone.  \n\nIf you want to take a shower, it’ll cost ya normally around $15.  Or you can save your “fuel points” and get a free shower after you’ve bought 1500 gallons of fuel.  Hell…  some truck stops even charge for overnight parking.  They also charge a premium to reserve a space since parking at night is so limited.  \n\nPublic chargers already cost $0.30-0.65 per kWh.  And the thing is that while “peak time” for cars is during the day and often around rush hour, the peak time for trucks would be at night when off duty. Thanks to HOS and ELDs tracking, it forces most drivers to stop driving at night since most shippers/receivers are only open 1st shift and maybe 2nd shift.  \n\n“Charge while getting loaded/unloaded” is something commonly said.  Except it ignores that’s a cost a shipper/receiver wouldn’t eat unless they had it for their own trucks.  And in the unlikely event they were to allow it, they would charge even more than the truck stops.  Large companies with hubs often have their own diesel pumps since it’s cheaper to buy in bulk.  It’s unheard of to let a non-company truck use them.  In the most extreme circumstances, it might happen, and the cost would be astronomical.\n\nI can’t help but see the sheer irony of pointing out how fuel costs are so detrimental, yet charging costs and truck stops gouging prices (which are well known to do) “are not something they’d worry about”.

It’s a completely different thing from car charging.  And you’d be sorry mistaken if you think other companies would just let Tesla take control of that market.  The ELDs are a prime example.  Before they were mandated, there was only a small handful of companies that offered the service, like Qualcomm.  Once they became federally mandated, everyone and their uncle started offering them.

Commercial grade charging stations other than Tesla have been around for years.\n\nHow has Tesla won?  Freightliner and Volvo have been selling EV Semis for a few years now (the eCascadia was getting road tested by companies in early 2018).  And I know for a fact that companies would prefer a known manufacturer than the unknown that is Tesla.  Hell…  The center position seat alone is a massive deterrent for most drivers.  Whoever made that decision clearly has never backed up a trailer.  A center seat means that when backing up, both sides are blind sides.  \n\nNot to mention parts and service.  Tesla is well known for having very slow service times; a huge negative in trucking.  Plus, everything on the truck is proprietary; a dealer only part.  If a market light goes out (and they will), that alone shuts down a truck.  Any scale or rod side DOT could shut down the truck and ticket it.  Will Tesla be open, or even have the part in stock?  Meanwhile, there’s 3 Freightliner dealers within 30 minutes of my yard, and 2 are open 24 hours.  Plus most the marker lights on them (which are LED like every other truck built the past 10+ years) are a universal type.  That means Peterbilt has them in stock 5 minutes from my yard and they’re open 24 hours too.  \n\nPlus, Tesla is not known for having durable interiors in their cars.  Truck interiors get beat up (and I can’t stress it enough) a lot.  Seats, armrests, seatbelts, steering wheels….  I’ve lost track of how many I’ve replaced.  A factory seat may last 400k-700k miles; really depends on the driver.  It could be the armrests are broke off, or the padding is completely worn.  Maybe it lost some functions (they’re air ride).  And the seats are universal…  A Freightliner seat fits in a Peterbilt/International/etc.  Frankly, based on what I’ve seen in the cars, I have no confidence in a Tesla semi’s interior being durable.  \n\nTesla may have gotten a head start in the EV car world, but they’re already years behind in the semi world.  And companies won’t be nearly as forgiving with weird quirks and poor service times.  It really demonstrates how Tesla garners a lot of hype.
