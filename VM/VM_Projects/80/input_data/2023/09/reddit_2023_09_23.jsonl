No one stock should make up any significant amount of your portfolio", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Your main point of agreement drastically minimizes what Tesla has done extremely well, and that is to create a scaled auto manufacturer from the ground up that has changed the entire personal transportation paradigm worldwide.  That wasn‚Äôt luck, and the hundreds of competitive advantages they gained in the process will continue.  I think there is a mass disconnect on how vital downstream/upstream infrastructure is to making fsd work to reduce latency and improve security by a magnitude.  Based on the telecoms it is projected to be in the latter part of this decade when we will start to see this manifest.  That‚Äôs not just robo-taxi‚Äôs.  It‚Äôll be warehouses, shipping terminals, transit stations, and once more Tesla will be at the front of the pack in that transition.   Sure, Tesla Dojo canned the Nvidia chips and maybe you disagree with that,but it was for a reason.  They are intending to process fsd information in multiple Terrabytes daily for machine learning purposes,  and management believes that their own dedicated self build supercomputer will do the job best, and securely.  There simply isn‚Äôt a company on the planet able to accumulate and use ev driver data in such volume, and that gives Tesla another very large and distinct advantage that will become apparent when external networks and infrastructure are capable to handle fsd.  To your point that there aren‚Äôt production level offerings yet, if analysts are ignoring developments and R&D announcements and existing prototypes and technologies, they do so once again at their peril much like it was in 2002-2004 when the company was thought by many analysts to be doa.  I do not see this as a very savvy way to invest which by definition involves some element of educated speculation.  I tend to hear Tesla contrarians and shorts more like pre-dotcom 20th century Wall Street types than people who look to understand trends and the future by understanding the past.
