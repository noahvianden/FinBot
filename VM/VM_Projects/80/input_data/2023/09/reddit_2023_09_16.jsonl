He won before negotiations started two months ago. From the get-go, General Motors, Ford Motor and Chrysler parent Stellantis were expected to spend more on wages because of the union’s pressure. The question is just how much of an increase, and so far their offers haven’t pleased the union, igniting this past week’s work stoppage.\n\n**Whatever happens, more money surely will be spent. Any wage increase further advances Tesla’s already tremendous cost advantage in EVs over its older U.S. peers, which are contending with generations of legacy expenses while trying to steer a costly transition to electric from gas-powered vehicles.**\n\nIn March, Musk revealed plans to build on his advantage by setting a goal of slashing manufacturing costs for the automaker’s next-generation vehicles by 50%, an ambitious agenda that will depend upon advanced automation, savvy engineering and other changes. \n\nThe Tesla chief executive’s actions this year have shown how Tesla can take advantage of a lower cost structure to engage in price wars with rivals around the world to juice sales.\n\nIn July, Tesla reported second-quarter profit that rose 20% even after reducing prices. Around the same time, in the midst of steep losses from its electric vehicles, Ford said it would slow its EV production growth. \n\nAll of this is playing out as the UAW seeks more than what the Detroit automakers say they can afford and remain competitive. The companies have offered wage increases of varying sizes reaching as high as 20% over four years, while UAW President Shawn Fain countered with a mid-30% increase, down from a previous ask of at least 40%. \n\n**The Detroit companies’ labor costs, including wages and benefits, are estimated at an average of $66 an hour, according to industry data. That compares with $45 at Tesla, which isn’t unionized and was founded 20 years ago. Meeting all of Fain’s initial demands would boost average hourly labor costs to $136 for the Detroit companies, Wells Fargo estimated.**\n\nA key difference between Tesla’s compensation plan and that of the UAW workers revolves around company upside. UAW workers have been getting profit-sharing bonuses while Tesla workers receive stock options, which don’t have a direct cash cost to the company. Over the years, Tesla shares have risen like a rocket, though there have been periods of turbulence. Shares this year have more than doubled.\n\nFain argues that past contracts haven’t kept up with inflation, hurting the union’s roughly 146,000 auto workers’ spending power, and that members’ sacrifices have helped make the companies profitable in recent years. \n\n**“This is our generation’s defining moment,” Fain said late Thursday before the walkout. “The money is there. The cause is righteous.”**\n\nShortly afterward, Ford responded, saying the union’s demands would “more than double Ford’s current UAW-related labor costs, which are already significantly higher than the labor costs of Tesla, Toyota and other foreign-owned automakers in the United States that utilize non-union-represented labor.”\n\nMany analysts, so far, are expecting that the Detroit companies will ultimately absorb the added costs. “The much larger issue is that it adds incremental pressure to their already challenged transition to an EV world,” Dan Levy, an analyst for Barclays, cautioned investors in a recent note \n\nFain this past week sounded annoyed when asked about Tesla’s cost advantage. \n\n“Competition is code word for race to the bottom, and I’m not concerned about Elon Musk building more rocket ships so he can fly in outer space and stuff,” Fain told CNBC on-air Wednesday. “Our concern is working-class people need their share of economic justice in this world.”\n\nFocus on the labor-cost gap is a classic part of Detroit negotiations—raised by executives, investors and analysts every cycle. Before Tesla, there was Toyota Motor and its nonunion pay rates. \n\nU.S. automakers spent years arguing that Asian rivals, without UAW contracts, benefited from cheaper labor costs that allowed them to plow savings into cars that appealed to consumers. \n\nNarrowing the labor-cost gap was a key part of the painful restructuring of the auto industry around 15 years ago, when union members made unprecedented concessions to help save their employers and their jobs. \n\nArt Wheaton, a labor expert at Cornell University, suggests that the UAW’s ability to get higher wages could help put heat on Tesla during any renewed effort to organize there.\n\n“I don’t think Elon Musk has all of that superwonderful, high-polished glow anymore,” he said, noting the controversies the billionaire has had regarding his recent ownership of Twitter-turned-X. “Some of that patina has been wiped clean.”\n\nThe UAW had its best shot in years to organize Tesla during labor strife in 2017 and 2018, when workers were feeling the burn of “production hell” at what was then the automaker’s lone assembly plant outside San Francisco as it struggled with the Model 3 sedan.\n\nBut the organizing effort failed.\n\nThe National Labor Relations Board has ruled that Tesla violated U.S. labor law in its handling of the matter, including statements by Musk that were considered threatening when he tweeted that hourly workers would lose stock options if they joined the UAW. An appeal by the company, which has denied wrongdoing, is pending. \n\nMusk has suggested that employee stock options make his factory workers the highest compensated in the industry, saying “quite a few” line workers have become “millionaires over the years from company stock grants.” Options allow workers to buy stock at a certain price after working at the company for a set amount of time. \n\nAt Tesla, the average pay for a manufacturing technician can range from $23 to $32 an hour, according to estimates by Glassdoor. Tesla advertises factory jobs in California with expected pay ranging from $24 to $67 an hour plus cash and stock awards and other benefits. \n\nOn Thursday, Musk took another jab at the UAW, after essentially daring the union last year to try again to organize his workers, boasting that his factories “have a great vibe.”\n\n“We encourage playing music and having some fun. Very important for people to look forward to coming to work!” he tweeted recently. “We pay more than the UAW btw, but performance expectations are also higher.”", "id": "16k890q", "created_utc": 1694872718.0, "score": 116, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 106, "comments": [{"body": "\"$66 to $136 an hour\"\n\nHow is that possible?

Ideas so great, they're mandatory.\" The thing is, incandescent bulbs provide a superior quality of light to the LEDs. They naturally radiate light in all directions and in the full spectrum or wavelengths (I forget the terminology there). LEDs are very directional and much more limited in how they radiate the light. For example, an LED \"bulb\" will consist of multiple LED lights arrayed in a circular pattern, in order to simulate the natural all directions radiation of an incandescent. They then have to make further modifications to have the light shine up and down. LEDs are superior in other ways, and now are quite close to incandescents in terms of light quality, but that is why choice was good. For people that still want them, incandescents should still be available, say by small, niche manufacturers, same as record albums are. Because after all, if the LEDs are really so superior, they will dominate the market. And using an incandescent is not like driving a lead gas car.\n\nLEDs are more energy-efficient, but the notion that they last longer is bunk. The very early ones did, I actually have one that I run near everyday for hours going on ten years now, but the bulb manufacturers since then have cut that so as to force people to buy them more (it was the big bulb manufacturers that lobbied for the legislation banning the incandescent bulbs in the first place, to force people to buy their more expensive bulbs).
