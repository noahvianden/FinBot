{"title": "Smaller Companies With Long Term Potential?", "selftext": "This is Stocks, would like to see discussion outside of tech and ETFs. I'd like to try to identify smaller companies with long term potential, there's a few which am considering investing for next decade. Here's few ideas which've found, do you have any feedback or similar ideas?\n\n1. NU is fast growing bank coming out of Brazil, was bought by Warren Buffet who's still holding. Bought when was $10-$12 so at even better price than what Buffet paid. They're expanding to Mexico, just realized wife got one of their cards few months back so they're expanding and are growing profits each quarter. 35b market cap.\n2. COCO is the maker of Vita Coco which is sold in Costco. Have seen loyal fanbase swear by this drink after researching about it. Lately, have been seeing Coconut water is on the rise.  Just saw documentary of fast growing export from countries like Sri Lanka. With 1.6b market cap, am thinking this company could be bought out in the future and Coconut water is growing trend.\n3. BRZE Braze company is interesting, helps companies push notifications to their customers through various platforms and is introducing AI generative marketing based off data collected from customers. CFO says will be profitable by 2024 Q4. 4b market cap, operates with subscription based model and growing rapidly their accounts with $500k+ subscription.\n4. SOFI bank is another interesting pick, not because Reddit but actually seeing commercials for this bank and is reaching me by actual marketing efforts now so real world implications. 8b market cap, chase bank is 440b so even x10 is still just 80b market cap which is more realistic imo if growth continues. Younger audience which supposedly will grow into their wealth.\n\nI'm not considering buy now, when fear and greed index takes another nose dive and another crisis starts I'd like to then DCA into these companies. The most famous art dealers will buy hundreds of paintings and hold long term, it's only a handful which actually explode immensely in value.\n\nRational is don't need to get everything right, but finding a 10x with a company near 5b market cap is more realistic imo than expecting Apple to x10 with current 2.7t market cap. There's also too much concentration in these massive behemoths which makes me rather want to invest in ETFs like QQQ and then have few moonshots on the side such as listed.

Trading around 12x cashflows, decent margins, decent network moat, they're buying back stock, and I think what's most impressive is that they're doing all this despite doubling their employees since Covid.\n\nThe only bad thing really was the huge write down they had to do on their Depop acquisition earlier this year and the fact they have slowing revenue growth.\n\n**2:** I know it's hated here but SNAP looks quite attractive at the moment. The main issue with SNAP is that they have no interest in optimising their margins, but the business itself is solid – despite being over a decade old they still have very solid DAU growth. I think it's an easy double if they were to focus on profitability, but to be honest I'd probably want it to go a little lower before I buy. That said, I think over the next 5-10 years it will be a solid company to own.\n\n**3:** DOCU looks decent, although it's more of a short-term thesis 1-3 years. At 17x cashflows it's cheap compared to most of tech and they're still growing nicely. My only issue with them is that it's hard to see how the eSignature space will play out longer-term. They have some serious competition entering the space at the moment which may slow growth in the years to come, but they're still the leading player and for that reason I think they'd make for a great acquisition for a CRM or ADBE.
