That's a long drive in a car that needs warranty repair. There's a Ford, GM and Nissan dealer 15 minutes away.   On top of that, Elon's an ass munch, but mostly the cars  are too spendy yet.\n\nPart of why TSLA is the stock market darling, is they say they get a bigger cut of every car sold, and that might be due to a smaller dealer network.   That smaller dealer network means a more limited customer base.\n\nElectric cars were more prevalent than gas until Henry Ford sold the Model T to rural people who didn't have electricity.   He sold it cheap, so regular folks could afford it.  That's how gas cars put the electric car companies out of business.     Tesla is so far selling expensive car to urban people, kind of the opposite of what Ford did.\n\nThat they could make electric cars 130 years ago, means that it is not particularly fancy new technology.     You just buy the motors and controllers from Dana, zf, etc the batteries from LG, Panasonic, etc throw them in a car, and bob's your auntie.  \n\nThe legacy automakers can ramp up to meet demand or not, in a way that Tesla cannot, as Tesla doesn't make the more complicated gas cars.
