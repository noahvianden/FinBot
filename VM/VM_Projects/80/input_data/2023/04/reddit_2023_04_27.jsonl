In other words, think of any attraction that you're allowed to see, but you're not allowed to actually touch the merchandise.

The Mona Lisa for example.\n\nI'm guessing that many of the areas of the great pyramids in Egypt is more about looking from 10 feet away. Not actually walking up to the temple walls and putting your greasy American hands all over it.\n\nAlso, I'm talking about the *future* of VR. Not what we have now.\n\nIn my previous posts, I've said that the metaverse is going to be huge, but it's still at least 10 to 15 years away. I'm not talking about VR equipment we have now. I'm talking about VR equipment we'll have in 10 to 15 years, which could be significantly more advanced. Remember, AI will be enhancing almost everything in about 5 or 6 years, so factor that in as well. \n\nWe could easily have some sort of gloves that we put on, and have tiny bubbles that inflate and Dis inflate to give a rough sensation of touch.\n\nAgain, would I rather go to Egypt myself and really touch things and really stand out in the sun, and feel the heat of the sun?

Italy would probably be my No.1 overall destination, and I will see that in *real* life, but there's plenty of other destinations where I might settle for 87 percent of the experience and keeping all my money right where it currently is\n\n\nAlso, I think you're dramatically underestimating just how good visuals are going to get. Forget photo-realism. VR has the ability to go beyond photo-realism. Remember that one Black Mirror episode with the two video game buddies? Where all the colors and everything is hyper real. More vivid colors, more vibrant sounds than even real life has to offer. Also, we're talking about full view of human peripheral vision. No downgrade over what we experience in real life. Everything super sharp and crystal clear. Always a beautiful sunny day if you want that. Or a rainy day if you want that. \n\nTwo of our most important senses as a human being is vision and sound. These two can be hijacked COMPLETELY. \n\nIt hasn't happened yet, so you don't even know what it could be like. We don't have it yet. That's why I'm talking about 10 to 15 years away.
