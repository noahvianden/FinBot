{"title": "Crayon Drawings for Impending Sell Off", "selftext": "After 500mg of caffeine and a 20-minute meditation, I felt particularly \"artistic\" and decided to doodle on charts with crayons. In this post, I will examine, in my opinion, the seven most important signals of the market: SPX (S&P), QQQ (NASDAQ), IWM (Russel), DIA( Dow Jones), VIX (Volatility Index), AAPL (Apple), and MFST (Microsoft).\n\nStarting off with SPX, we can see that it has broken out of its long-term downtrend MOAT (Mother of all trends) and even broke out of its February down trend. Currently, it appears to be in \"no man's land,\" with the biggest form of resistance coming from the previous high in February. I personally see no reason for SPX to start pushing up above the February high, but if anyone has a reasonable explanation as to why it might, I am all ears. The RSI (Relative strength index) is at 62.58, and, as demonstrated by the white horizontal line, just about every time it gets to this area, it is followed by a significant decline. Looking at the MACD (Moving average convergence divergence), we can see that the histogram is in positive territory as well as the MACD line. However, it appears to be turning over and going to the downside. Keep in mind this is in the daily time frame.\n\n[\\[SPX\\]](https://preview.redd.it/dzwozct586ua1.png?width=5588&format=png&auto=webp&s=47aa321d8b0ab80de83085cde47553383a2e2699)\n\nNext, looking at QQQ, we can see that it is beginning to stall as it is in extremely overbought territory. The MACD line has passed the signal line, and it is CLEAR that downside momentum is beginning. Since QQQ already went above its February high, the next high it would have to overtake is from August of 2022, which is roughly 5% from current prices. I personally do not think this rally makes sense considering the state of AAPL and MSFT which I analyze down below. Together, both stocks comprise roughly a quarter of QQQ.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[QQQ](https://preview.redd.it/oqbokwe6n6ua1.png?width=4848&format=png&auto=webp&s=f76a04441ab6b269613174c97361234432ccd52d)\n\nSimilar to SPX, DIA has broken through MOAT and it heading toward the February high. However, it is in overbought conditions. I don't see a melt up from here and I think it is about to fall with the rest of the indexes. Maybe it pushes a little higher and then it is in for the reckoning.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[DIA](https://preview.redd.it/8xoep9fbn6ua1.png?width=1980&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2e619a01b03f2538a74a0398c2134accfba4e75)\n\nHere's where it gets a bit confusing for me, and any explanation is welcome. IWM looks like it is ready to pop. It is definitely \"the canary in the Cole mine\". It is oversold and on the MACD, and the looks like it is heading up on the RSI as well. It looks like it has room to run to the upper end of the trend line (shown in yellow). Maybe QQQ and SPX go on to drop while IWM pops but something tells me they are going to move in harmony.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[\\[IWM\\]](https://preview.redd.it/y8qyjaob86ua1.png?width=5588&format=png&auto=webp&s=64315c545306382ff3d10e661a5ecac9a7965c5e)\n\nThe VIX is currently at 17.07. The VIX usually spikes with earnings, which are right around the corner. Additionally, it appears to be forming a bullish divergence.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[\\[VIX\\]](https://preview.redd.it/djjx3cvc86ua1.png?width=5588&format=png&auto=webp&s=1aaf978ae8727c2655a75bc1719848744ac4b7a8)\n\nDo I even need to explain? I mean, if you had to take a guess... where do you think it is AAPL is going? AAPL makes up 7.08% of SPX and 12.43% of QQQ.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[\\[AAPL\\]](https://preview.redd.it/rjbe5gke86ua1.png?width=5588&format=png&auto=webp&s=d47f911e99dd76bfc53dce26fbc009ebbdbb3469)\n\nFinally, looking at Microsoft, it is trading right at its August high, with no catalyst to push it above this point. Microsoft comprises 12.68% of QQQ and 6.2% of SPY.\n\n[MSFT](https://preview.redd.it/fmfgomien6ua1.png?width=1980&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d549db2e4bd020b77bee384677ec2bd2b785aae)\n\nIn conclusion: everything looks like it is about to sell off. I am extremely bearish. I do not know \\*when\\* the sell off will begin, but I think it is wise to average into SPXS or SQQQ as current conditions present downside. In light of economic conditions, I find it difficult to believe that we are not going to be experiencing an earnings recession that would serve as a catalyst to the downside coming off of extremely overbought conditions.", "id": "12numt7", "created_utc": 1681618143.0, "score": 104, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 86, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|4|**First Seen In WSB**|1 day ago\n**Total Comments**|3|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|4 days|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n>TL;DR: Sold all my stocks and bought SPXS.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "But did OP find his puppy in the end?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "![img](emote|t5_2th52|18632)", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "So puts on IWM, calls on SPX and QQQ…got it", "score": 39, "replies": [{"body": "Exactly.

We are going to see a correction for the next mini financial instability crisis, but then SPX/QQQ's will go crazily stupidly high. Because my prediction is that what we're going to experience is a currency crisis and inflation will go out of control. Why? \n\nFor starters everyone in this day and age have so much access to information, that in some ways it's hard to get into a recession/selloff. So what we would need is a black swan event in order to trigger a true sell off? And even if we get one look at the recent regional bank crisis, Dowjones went down 1-2%, but Nasdaq and QQQ's went up on a bull run. Why? Because the FED/Treasury/Government bailed out these banks and did every form of communication and signalling to tell everyone don't panic. Institutions can make dumb decisions, but there will be no consequences for them, and even better they will bail em out with your tax payers money. \n\nThe FED/Treasury claims that the FDIC will cover both uninsured and insured deposits at SVB/Signature and potentially other banks, with the added bonus that it'll cost nothing to tax payers. Absolute BS, the FDIC before only had 130B+ yet SVB and Signatures alone basically gobbled all of that money. So how are they going to cover others? Well the solution that they came out with is reliable good ol **print more money = QE.** Essentially, with the backstopping they already started QE in some form. And that's having a knock on effect in helping bond markets to price down interest rates starting the recent decline of the USD. \n\nThrough this, other nations are watching and after reviewing it that the US economy isn't strong as it claims it is. In fact the US will print/bail out their bad companies at the expense of money borrowed from others/future self. This have already started to influence foreign nations in starting to hedge and move away from the USD. Countries have already signed deals to start trading with their own currencies instead of the USD. Now don't get me wrong these trade deals are small and aren't substantial enough to trigger a currency crisis. But, remember all it'll take is just one little push and things can snowball downhill rapidly. Just as SVB showed, it began with bad decisions, then one earnings call then a few billions $ withdrawal, then 40b, then 100b. Once it starts, it's hard to stop. And unlike with SVB where the solution was money and you just needed to throw a ton at it. What happens when the very money (solution to financial crisis) becomes the very issue? How do you stop nations from moving away or running away from the USD? Offer higher interest rates? Yeah right with a 31T and growing debt (And Biden's new 7.5T bill proposal (we all know it ain't passing at that price point but u get the message)), no way the US could service interest rate of 5%+ for long term. So what will the FED/Treasury do? If history is any good indicator, they'll try to redirect the blame, state that they can't control inflation or even better for worse they'll claim the solution is to print more money ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271). The rest is history as they say and there we go we have a currency crisis. \n\nOverall, we will see a temporary correction for whatever next mini financial crisis that comes up next, but the FED/Treasury will overreact and go full on **QE**. Thereby, devaluing the USD, triggering other nations to minimize their holdings of USD bonds/treasuries pushing inflation higher. Causing the QQQ/SPX to go up, not because there is good news, but because the real value of the dollar will drop and stock markets are readjusting for the difference in inflation. Need proof? Just look at EU nations  and UK stock index. Some of them have recently hit all times highs, yet these nations are facing fundamental financial instability and higher inflation than the US, so why? Because their currencies have gone down in the last year, and this is evident when you look at a 5 years basis. All of them are down, and the stock markets are just readjusting for the difference of value. So America will also have it's own taste of devaluation, it's just that the FED/Treasury have kicked the can so far and now the can is about to bounce back into their face.\n\n**TLDR:** QQQ/SPX will go down at next mini financial crisis sometime this year, but will go to the moon because USD will be devalued by FED/Treasury to save economy from said financial crisis. Foreign nations will sell off USD bond holdings causing inflation to re-surge in the US and more QE will be done to just barely stabilize the economy. So QQQ/SPX goes up not because of good news, but because it's adjusting for inflation.", "score": 20, "replies": [{"body": "You should have a post yourself next time.

Despite the widely available access to information, there is also a great deal that we don't know. That is why statements from the FED or newly released economic data has an impact on the market.

To clarify, the \"access to information\" was meant to say that while yes it alone won't prevent a temporary correction. Due to channel of information being so much more free and accessible in comparison to 2008. Government/FED/Treasury can immediately mediate and get their message across to the markets rapidly. Thereby, calming other sectors that were panicking (Ie: Tech/SPY etc) and stabilize quickly. This prevented a \"**proper correction across all markets\"**. As you saw in the recent collapse of regional bank stocks, while financial sector took a beating other sectors such as Nasdaq, technology, commodities etc actually rebounded rapidly after 1 day correction. And went onto a bull market. This was due of course of swift action of bailing out and constant 24/7 communications that they would bail out and stabilize markets no matter what (discount lending windows etc). This was what I was pointing out as a major problem in the inhibition of a proper correction or a correction of 5-10% on a major index. Due to this, all we will see is a short term dip when the next crisis hits. Then when the FED/Treasury goes full QE, because the scale of the crisis we will see markets rally to insane levels not because of the action of the FED saving the markets, rather it's the stimulation of liquidity and free money floating around.

China cannot unpeg the USD because push come to shove they have to buy food from us and we will in all likely hood never allow those sales in anything other than USD. \n\nHaving said that every analyst worth their salt right now is saying we are in for a correction but the USA is a service based economy and that said 70% of our economy is service based so it's not by a small margin. We are not seeing that drop off in service based sales yet since we had over a years worth of pent up demand on the market. We are seeing a drop off in mid tier merchandise while weirdly enough higher end consumables have popped just look at LVMH( Louis voutton prob butcherd that) its sales aren't dipping they are growing. So I think that the correction will be very stock specific and not an entire broad based sell off like alot of people expect. \n\nJust to be clear though I do believe that if the FED comes out next month and says it's pausing we will break overhead resistance and start a bull market.\n\nIf the FED says we are gonna do 25 pt hike and then pause for more economic data ect you will see a 3-5% ish sell off and then grind back up to break through. If they do 25pt continuing hikes market is gonna shit the bed and test our lows around 3600. \n\nHistorically an extended bear market normally doesn't shift until after the rate hike cycle is complete.\n\nMy best guess is a lot of chop between now and the next FED meeting but at that meeting I could see some fireworks the following week or so based on their rhetoric", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "What do you think about the coming debt limit crisis ?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "The debt limit increase or crisis either way will only further contribute to my thesis about the devaluation of the USD in the long run. As more debt increase = harder to service that interest, and if America defaults, you can see interest rates spike and foreign nations panicking to sell off more treasuries. However, I think that a default is unlikely as in the last couple of days, house speaker McCarthy came out and stated he had a plan and would show the full extent of it tomorrow at Wall street. But, he did indicated that his proposal essentially is a raise in the debt ceiling, but spending for essentials medicaid, social security, defence NDS stuffs, would grow at a 1-2% increase per year. \n\nThis shows that at least he isn't trying to drag this out and leave it last second.
