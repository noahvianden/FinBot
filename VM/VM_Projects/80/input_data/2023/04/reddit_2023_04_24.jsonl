{"title": "Why lower margins now if the growth rate is on average 50% YoY going forward?", "selftext": "So Tesla has been projecting on average 50% YoY growth for some period of time. They are already doing like 450K/qtr, so about 1.8M per year. Using anything near 50% growth YoY would mean hundreds of thousands of additional sales rolling in less than a year from now.  \n\nLet's say they're projecting to do 2.4M sales in 2024. That would be 600K more than 2023, or about 50K/month.  \n\nAre you telling me Tesla massively cut prices in 2023 even though they were expecting demand for 600K+ additional sales less than 12 months from now? That doesn't really make sense.  \n\nIf you know you have a whopping 600K additional sales coming your way, why would you cut prices rather than just hold some additional inventory? Tesla is the only dealer of Teslas. Unlike traditional dealers than may want to race to the bottom to move inventory in a competitive climate, Tesla is the only dealer. No one can cause a race to the bottom in pricing/value.  \n\nTesla would have to have been facing declines in the hundreds of thousands of units if they couldn't even count on their 50% growth rate to eat up that short-term supply surplus.  \n\nSo either Tesla demand fell hard and margins will likely go lower and stay there, or their growth rate will be nowhere near 50% going forward.  \n\nIt just doesn't make sense to throw away so much profit when that volume of sales is just around the corner and growing at the rate they say.", "id": "12x7bgs", "created_utc": 1682321187.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.5, "num_comments": 88, "comments": [{"body": "\"just hold some additional inventory\" costs a lot of money too", "score": 20, "replies": [{"body": "Only if we're talking massive amounts of cars.

Up until now Tesla has been supply constrained, which is to say they've been skimming those members of the market most willing to pay top $$ - and probably not that influenced by price.  The thing most of us Tesla investors were optimistically hoping for is that the pool of those price insensitive buyers would be infinite. However it seems they are finite, and we are starting to have to price more competitively to maintain demand to meet production. I.e. we've gone from being supply constrained to demand constrained. The source of anxiety for some is that Tesla is supply driven, in that we have no intention to slow our exponential growth.  That being the case, and exponential growth being a hard thing to model, it can empathise with the genuinely held belief that if you flood the market with exponentially increasing numbers of Teslas, we could quickly hit the *unknown and unknowable* limit of demand for a reasonable or acceptable price.\n\nNow... as us long term Tesla supporters know damn well, Tesla is in a league of its own in terms of clarity of vision, ability to execute, cost efficiency through vertical integration and incredible innovation.  Thing is, do we want to end up as the low cost operator - the only one able to deliver low margin cars at insanely low prices? Or do we want a different value proposition that captures more margin? FSD is clearly the bet we are making, but I wonder if some more consideration should also be given to the luxury side of the market?  As anyone who has driven a Tesla can attest, they are... spartan.  Bit of a tangent, but I wonder if Tesla could partner with a 'tuning shop' or some such marketing hookup such that they could put in some premium interior and features and double the price?  Ultimately as our footprint gets bigger we're going to need to be a bit more nuanced in our models, features, upgrades, bundles and pricing if we wish to capture all the money on the table from customers.

And even when they came out, it was a novelty and range-anxiety was a thing. But the supercharger network continued to grow and now it is much less of a concern. But consider still... Look at many major cities and you will not find much, if any, curbside charging or other flexible charging options (which are possibly also somewhat dependent on building out solar and battery infrastructure). But if more EV's are sold, you can fairly assume it will be a matter of time as that infrastructure develops driving even greater EV adoption.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": ">Tesla massively cut prices in 2023\n\nprices are about back to what they were in 2020:\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1F5IQOynIawoXiJPVarLDgPQDJAdzY8b5Vamw-Vf3eSY\n\nprices were boosted upwards last year as Teslas got popular for wealthy people looking to avoid $5 - $6 gas prices last summer and so order wait times went from days to months.\n\nUS fleet average sales price is $45k ~ $50k:\n\nhttps://www.coxautoinc.com/market-insights/kbb-atp-february-2023/\n\nso I don't think Teslas are particularly over-priced right now given the $100-$200/mo operating cost savings many people can enjoy with electric (as a LEAF owner I've saved ~$15,000 on gas and oil changes since 2015).\n\n>It just doesn't make sense to throw away so much profit when that volume of sales is just around the corner and growing at the rate they say.\n\nTesla's business model is to run a lean operation and not have months of inventory sitting on dealer lots all across the country.\n\n$5000 lost profit on 2 million vehicles this year would be a ~$3 EPS hit\n\nbut Tesla's $500B market cap is not predicated on selling 2M cars per year but rather 4M+\n\n4M x $50k ASP x 10% net x 30 P/E / 3B shares = $200 sp\n\nInterest rates have gone up from 2.5% in 2021 to 5.5% currently, so a $800/mo payment can buy a $50k car now but could buy that $55k car @ 2.5%.\n\nAlso suppressing demand to some extent is consumer sentiment, tech layoffs, and the general mass media drumbeat of RECESSION RECESSION RECESSION everybody is hearing.\n\nTesla's just gotta set prices to keep their factories running as fast as they can, since the BEV market is not like the ICE market in that there are [network effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect) in play – more Teslas mean more Tesla superchargers, more Tesla service network expansion, more people putting in a Tesla L2 charger in their garage, more people being exposed to Tesla cars via friends and coworkers.\n\nA $5000/car hit now is worth all that. Sure it's $10B, but like I said that's only $3 per share hit and TSLA has bigger fish to fry this decade.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}
