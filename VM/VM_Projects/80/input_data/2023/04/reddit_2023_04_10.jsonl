The 25 strike Jan24 calls cost about $5.30 each which is $530 total, we have to presume you bought more than 1 contact.  \n\nDividing $530 into $23,500 looks to be about 45 contracts.  While the number of contracts is not specifically needed to do the math below, as an obviously new trader you are putting a lot at risk and may not really be aware how much.\n\nThe 21Apr 28 calls sell for .85 each or $85 per contract, and again seems to be above 41 contracts.  \n\nYes, you will keep the $85 per contract if BAC finishes below $28 by Friday of next week.  As the stock price is currently $27.94, and based on the delta of .51 there is a 51% probability it will end ITM and be assigned.  \n\nIf this happens you would be short somewhere around 4,100 shares of BAC at the $28 price.  You can buy long shares to replace these at the current stock price which might cause a loss if the price went up.  The long 25 strike leg is there to help provide protection if the stock does move up and could be closed for a possible profit to help offset any loss on the short shares.  \n\nThat is not really a big risk unless the stock moves up quickly.  Note that new traders should consider trading 1 or maybe 2 contracts until they understand the risks.  \n\nThe more significant risk is the stock dropping where you would collect the $85 per contract but the long Jan24 calls losing value.  These could lose a fair amount off of the $5.30 cost paid if the stock drops and stays down.\n\nPresumably, you have a long bullish analysis on BAC as it moving up slowly in price will help the short leg expire to keep the premiums and the long leg increasing in value.  \n\nNote that there is an ER coming up on 4/18 and which may see the stock price move unpredictably.
