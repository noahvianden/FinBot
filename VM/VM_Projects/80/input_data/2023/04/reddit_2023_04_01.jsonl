Every OECD country in the world and probably 80% of the non OECD countries heavily subsidize their farming industries with a slew of tax breaks and handouts. Why is that? Are farmers stupid? Maybe they don't know what they're doing. Or is food going out of fashion? Nobody wants to eat anymore... that must be it. \n\nI'll use an anecdote: I once had a city job in a corporation as a lowly IT help dude and was getting paid $400/day for my efforts. No keyboard went undusted in my realm. One lunchtime I went to the supermarket for a meal and, as is the usual case when entering a supermarket, the first thing you see is the cornucopia of fresh foods laid out in pyramids of vibrant colours as a cathedral to the success of capitalism. \n\nAnyway, in front of me was a giant wooden palette box full of avocados stacked waist high on sale for $1 each and I realised that for what I was getting paid (before tax), I could literally buy the entire mountain. 400 avocados. I could carry them all home and make a bathtub full of guacamole deep enough to drown in. Every day.\n\nNow think about it. It takes 5 years to grow an avocado tree before you even get any fruit. Then imagine how many avocado trees you need to get 400 fruit off it. Now you need to ship it 50-200 km in trucks and then have people store and stack it all in a warehouse/supermarket and get it sold at a small profit. It doesn't make economic sense. The only way it's possible is that farmers are getting massively underpaid by the oligopoly of sellers above them and are in turn getting held up by fuel tax rebates, loan forgiveness, cheap loan rates, food boards regulating prices, cheap labor laws, govt disaster insurance and the list goes on. \n\nAs a result, farmers are pinned to the mat from day one. Either they play ball with the myriad of conditions laid out to them by the govt's and resellers or they go under and the whole web of market controls exists primarily for one end goal: to keep prices stable and way below their real level. Taxpayers subsidize their own food at the supermarket. Just as much as shoppers did in the days of the Soviet Union. \n\nFarming is far too important to be left to the farmers to run or to capitalism to regulate. 3 days without food and society would collapse. See how much the web went batshit crazy over just an egg shortage. So there's this whole pantomime of there being a capitalist system with the farmer growing food and getting paid for his produce, yada yada but the whole thing is a carefully orchestrated, centrally planned operation. If the glibertarians had their way and erased all government interference in favour of capitalism red in tooth and claw, you'd see food prices jump by double digits overnight amidst massive swinging shortages and oversupplies.
