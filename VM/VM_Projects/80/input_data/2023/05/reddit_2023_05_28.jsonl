However, it's important to note that the specific details and extent of their dependency can change over time due to various factors such as business strategies, and supply chain considerations.*\n\n*Nvidia has been a major customer of TSMC for the production of its chips. TSMC is one of the world's largest semiconductor foundries and has a strong reputation for advanced manufacturing processes. Nvidia has utilized TSMC's fabrication facilities for several of its high-performance GPUs, including the latest generations.*\n\n*Nvidia's reliance on TSMC for chip production can be attributed to various factors, such as TSMC's ability to provide cutting-edge semiconductor manufacturing processes, economies of scale, and capacity to meet Nvidia's production demands. The partnership between Nvidia and TSMC has been mutually beneficial, with TSMC benefiting from Nvidia's high-volume orders and Nvidia leveraging TSMC's expertise and manufacturing capabilities.*\n\n*However, it's worth noting that Nvidia has also explored diversifying its chip production sources to mitigate risks and secure supply chains. They have partnered with other foundries like Samsung Electronics for the production of certain GPU models, which indicates an effort to reduce dependency on a single supplier.*", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Isn't that market manipulation?
