The fact is Nvidia will likely do well over the long term, but is also grossly overpriced with insane expectations.

Most of that increased revenue next quarter is coming from investments in CapEx from companies like MSFT and AMZN because now they have to ramp up spending for all this new interest.   Here is the kicker, not all AI tech companies will benefit, MSFT and AMZN have to spend more than they expected now, MSFT and others will not allow NVDA to dominate this hardware space longer term and will quickly ‚Äúbuild their own‚Äù.
