People love predicting what is likely to happen is 100% so they can say “SEEEEE!!!?? I KNEW IT!” It’s so childish. Just like they like betting on favorites in sports like they’re geniuses picking up “free money” but are always down after >20 bets \n\nThere probably is a 2-4% chance of some kind of default happening, meaning *something* other than a clean raise will likely happen 1-2 time in your life. We already had one a few years ago. There is a good reason our credit rating got lowered. There are corporations with the ability and higher incentives to pay their debt than the US government. It really shouldn’t be called the “risk free” rate and professors have always been reluctant to repeat that propaganda. I expect another downgrade in our lifetime since politicians have other incentives and are less aligned with bond holders than CEOs of the safest firms\n\nThis is something serious to factor in. The know it alls will brag year after year when this doesn’t happen, then once every 10-20 years will get wiped out from over exposure. This how so many geniuses with actual stock gambling skills still end up jumping off balconies every decade\n\nEdit: something else interesting, I think the stock market on average had something like a 20% draw down almost every year. More likely to happen before a recession.
