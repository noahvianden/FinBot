{"title": "Why I'm getting PYPL calls for earnings", "selftext": "Another major week of earnings around the world and across the market cap spectrum is on the way. Today PayPal (PYPL) kicks things off and will be reporting earnings from the most recent quarter this afternoon. With a solid EPS beat rate history and low valuation, I just had to make a post about it. [Last post was AAPL and it did fairly well](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/137wdc6/how_to_play_tonights_aapl_earnings_safely/). \n\nPYPL is a global, technology-driven payment platform with hundreds of millions of direct customer relationships in more than 200 countries. It empowers a streamlined digital and mobile payment experience in-browser, on mobile devices, and in-app. PayPal is also accepted at 75%+ of the largest 100 internet retailers. The California-based $85 billion market cap Transaction and Payment Processing Services industry company within the Financials sector trades at a high 12-month GAAP price-to-earnings ratio and does not pay a dividend, according to [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/).\n\nWall Street analysts expect PayPal will report earnings per share of $1.10 as opposed to earnings of $0.880 per share in the same quarter of the previous year. Analysts also expect sales to increase by 7.69% over the previous year's quarter to $6.98 billion. They expect an average profit of $4.89 per share for the current fiscal year, compared to $4.13 per share in the previous year. On average, analysts predict that the company will report annual sales of $29.38 billion.\n\n**Factors at Play**\n\nPayPal’s persistent efforts toward strengthening the product portfolio are likely to have aided the company in gaining traction among customers in the first quarter. The company’s upcoming results are likely to have benefited from Venmo’s product line strength, which is expected to have continued to aid customer engagement on PayPal’s platform. This is expected to have boosted growth in total active accounts in the quarter under review. Venmo’s strong monetization efforts are likely to have aided its adoption rate in the to-be-reported quarter.\n\nRobust PayPal Checkout experiences are expected to have sustained the company’s momentum in the quarter under review. PayPal is expected to have gained from the growing proliferation of buy now pay later (BNPL) solution on the back of its strong offerings. Further, strengthening offerings for small businesses is likely to have boosted growth in the company’s payments volume in the yet-to-be-reported quarter.\n\n**Key Metrics to Consider**\n\nTotal payment volume (TPV), active customer accounts, payment transactions per active account and the total number of payment transactions are considered to be the key metrics for analyzing PayPal’s business growth.\n\nFor the first quarter, the number of active customer accounts is estimated to be at 438 million, up 2.1% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. The consensus mark for payment transactions per active user is pegged at 52 million, suggesting growth of 10.6% from the year-ago quarter’s reported number. The consensus estimate for the total number of payment transactions is around 5.8 billion, indicating an improvement of 12.6% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. The estimate floating around for TPV is pegged at $348 billion, suggesting growth of 7.8% on a year-over-year basis.\n\n**But Q1 Results Won't just be a Game of Numbers**\n\nPayPal was one of a host of fintech companies slashing headcounts earlier this year. Layoff announcements have largely rewarded shareholders, but the stock has not caught a major bid over the last several months. The business’s skew to lower- and middle-income consumers is a risk during this phase of the business cycle. Moreover, increasing competition from payment providers could high ARPU metrics this year – that will be a key metric to keep your eye on in the upcoming earnings report.\n\nAmongst some [management changes](https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/02/10/paypal-ceo-to-step-down-good-news-for-investors/), it is key that the next phase of the business’s growth has a clear focus. Notably, the company's president and CEO Dan Schulman announced his retirement on Dec. 31, but said he will continue to serve on the board. About one month later, there were news on CFO Blake Jorgensen stepping down from his role after a leave of absence for health reasons. Also, PayPal's chief transformation officer and senior vice president of finance and analytics, Erica Gessert, joined the work marketplace Upwork as CFO in April. \n\nIt’s expected that guidance will only be given one quarter at a time, but a guidance raise would certainly help the share price – and I think we could get that based on decent numbers from other firms in the industry.\n\n**Competitive Risks**\n\nPYPL has exposure to how the macro consumer picture evolves. Should a deeper recession take place, then the firm will struggle. Also, I think too much focus on slashing expenses could be a risk to market share - if that mindset cuts into high-ROI initiatives, then its competitors could pounce. I also have apprehension regarding how the new CEO will lead as smaller transaction players grow. What's more, new regulations in the industry could hurt a larger player like PayPal and potentially favor smaller companies with less dominance.\n\n**Peer Comparison**\n\nRelative to its competitors, PYPL is priced with a mid-range valuation. I took a look at Fiserv (FISV), Adyen (OTCPK:ADYEY), Block (SQ), Fidelity National Financial Information Services (FIS), and Global Payments (GPN). Forward operating P/Es range from 9.4 on the low end (FIS) to more than 70 with ADYEY. PYPL's 1.09 PEG is attractive compared to its peers - only GPN has a lower ratio using forward estimates.\n\nBut PYPL sports better revenue growth than GPN in the out year, with a better net income margin. PYPL is also the leader in the space with its $85 billion market cap, and market share should be protected should the management team execute well on PayPal's next stage of growth.\n\n**Catalysts**\n\nI'll be looking for what the new CEO has to say on upcoming product developments as it introduces upgrades to Venmo and other digital wallet services. If those come to fruition, then there's a reasonable chance that 2023 EPS guidance of $4.87 could be raised.\n\nWhat could help support the stock this year is the firm's stock buyback plan. With about $5 billion of net free cash flow in FY23, there's ample room for at least $3 billion.\n\nAnother upside catalyst is activism from [Elliott Management](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/30/activist-elliott-snaps-up-an-interest-in-paypal-this-is-what-could-be-next-for-the-payments-giant.html). That pressure could result in further cost-cutting initiatives. In addition to buybacks, a dividend announcement can't be ruled out - I assert that would be viewed positively by the market since the company has plenty of FCF to reward shareholders while still funding growth projects. A new, streamlined PayPal may be needed in this competitive landscape.\n\n**Valuation**\n\nOn valuation, analysts at [BofA](https://business.bofa.com/en-us/content/global-research-about.html) see earnings rebounding sharply in 2023 after declines last year. Per-share profits are seen as continuing to rise at a double-digit pace through 2025. The [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/) consensus outlook is about on par with what BofA projects. No dividends are expected to be paid on the stock, but PYPL is solidly free cash flow positive.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/EwPJGOY.png\n\nUsing out-year estimates, the earnings multiples are attractive on the stock considering the high growth outlook. What’s more, the EV/EBITDA ratio is about in line with the market. Overall, if we assign just a 20x forward P/E (a sharp discount to its 37.7 5-year average), then the stock should be near $98. Lastly, the forward PEG ratio is very low at 1.09 compared to the 5-year mean of 1.97.\n\n**Looking at the Options Chain**\n\nDigging into the upcoming earnings report, data from Option Research & Technology Services ([ORATS](https://orats.com/)) show a consensus EPS forecast of $1.10 which would be a strong 25% climb from $0.88 of per-share profits earned in the same period a year ago. ORATS reports that there have been six analyst upgrades of EPS estimates since the February quarterly report. With a strong beat rate history, topping estimates in 11 of the 12 last instances, an earnings beat is likely. But shares have a mixed performance history following earnings dates.\n\nThis time around, the options market has priced in a 6.6% earnings-related stock price swing. That is the cheapest straddle dating back to July of 2021. With a lower VIX today, it makes sense. Also, notice small moves in the stock in the previous pair of earnings reactions. Overall, I see the options as fairly priced given these dynamics. So with a strong EPS beat rate history, and with cheaper options, are calls in order?\n\n**The Technicals**\n\nWith an attractive valuation and fairly valued options before Monday evening’s earnings release, the chart is less sanguine. Notice in the graph below that shares are consolidating in a descending triangle pattern. The presumption is that price action will resolve in the trend of larger degree – which is lower in this instance. A breakdown under $65 would imply a measured move price objective at an absurdly low level based on the top of the pattern being near $120, so we need a more realistic support bogey.\n\nThere is longer-term support in the low to mid-$40s that likely attracts buyers. But a move above $90 would help support the case for a bullish breakout from the pattern. Also, the $81 level represents the flat 200-day moving average (the 40-week moving average is essentially the same thing), so rising above that on a weekly closing basis would be bullish\n\n**What to do for Earnings?**\n\nPaypal moves on average about 7.6 ± 5.9% with earnings. Last earnings, it rose about 6%. Could we see another rise like it? If so, a PYPL call spread looks good, grabbing the 5/12 80c for $140 and selling the 85c for $53 (at the time of writing this). This means you can get the spread for $87, this could offer 5.7x gains. Ideally we want the stock to go up to $81-85, an increase of 5.8 to 11.4%. Keep in mind, with earnings you can never predict things with certainty. This post is not financial or investment advice, consider it as just me offering some education based on what analysts tend to look for in a company when it's time to make a last minute earnings prediction. In fact, just because I'm posting it, Paypal might crash.
