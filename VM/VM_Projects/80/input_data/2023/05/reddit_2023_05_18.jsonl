{"title": "DD: NVDA to $700 by this time next year", "selftext": "**The A100 is the current market leader for AI tasks at $10,000-$18,000 per card. Its purchased by every major cloud vendor.**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m0d8s7zbpn0b1.png?width=982&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4744071f5ed7ca45f9886a5d4e00385e783d951a\n\n[https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/a100/](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/a100/)\n\n**The A100 is the market leader because it has ASIC cores that accelerate the major ML libraries such as pytorch and tensorflow. Other vendors are years behind nvidia.**\n\n* The market for HPC AI cards is currently $10B. Overall HPC market is $35B. Market projections are 20%-40% growth in AI HPC buys over the next 5 years. In the worst case projection that market becomes $25B, best case is $54B. Add in all HPC buys, and the projection for 2028 sits around $50B-$80B.\n* Nvidia's current revenue is $24B split into gaming, embedded, HPC, and other markets, so there is a good case for it tripling revenue in 5 years just based on AI growth.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/be28h4tdpn0b1.png?width=629&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5fb26a7deceb7f0952ef049a3d31471aa66c5299\n\n* There is currently a chip surplus, so Nvidia revenue is down overall because of reduced demand in other markets, but this is projected to change\n* However, AI chips use the latest node processes from fabs (predominantly TSMC for AI), which are much more supply constrained than the overall chip market. The overall chip market is predominantly older processes.\n* The A100 is currently selling over MSRP because firms are madly trying to scoop them up. In fact it is backordered by a month and a half on all major public vendors.\n* This means nvidia is losing at least a month and a half of AI HPC revenue this year already due to supply problems. If they were not supply constrained, revenue would beat last year.\n* Long term, Nvidia can renegotiate fab contracts to outbid other chip designers. Apple outbid everyone for the latest TSMC 5nm node process for their M1 chips, but seeing as A100s are being sold by scalpers for almost double MSRP, Nvidia can change this in coming years.\n\nThis is the original reason NVDA is going up. **Are NVDA detractors right saying its overvalued now that it has gone up almost 200% from lows this year? Yes its overvalued based even on the generous projected revenue above.**\n\nThen why is it continuing to go up? Other factors for why NVDA is going up:\n\n* Market tailwind from tech stocks overall going up. This can account for 1/3 of NVDA's rise, and will continue to dramatically effect it.\n* Index funds rebalancing. NVDA is on the Nasdaq-100 which is tracked by many mutual funds and etfs. These funds are buying NVDA to rebalance their market-cap weighted portfolios.\n* The \"IT\" stock. Investors are craving another crazy stock to cash in on. They've seen a stock as dumb as a certain video game store go to the moon, so why not a company that actually has some fundamentals?\n\nWhy $700 next year:\n\n* Nasdaq-100 will go up at least 30%. This gives a baseline of $400 for NVDA next year\n* The AI gold rush won't stop for another three years. NVDA, MSFT, and GOOGL are the only public stocks that are well positioned to benefit from AI. NVDA is the public company, as a proportion of its revenue, that will be affected the most. This makes it the best company to invest in if you believe AI is the next miracle (I don't). This will mean it will outperform the market. Lets say another 30% on top of the market or $500 by next year this time\n* FOMO. All you regards who just want to make money will jump on the bandwagon. This will be around another 60% of today's value. All that together is 120%, and gives us $700.\n\n**Proof I'm putting my money where my mouth is below. My plan is to hold for one year.**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1wvbpwvgpn0b1.png?width=866&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e4b547233d0047f28393eba8bc130694ab53220b", "id": "13lb98n", "created_utc": 1684444841.0, "score": 115, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 121, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|2 years ago\n**Total Comments**|5|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|5 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n>TL;DR: NVDA is overvalued, but will continue to go up for another year, then crash.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "NVDA will buy APPL next year!
