{"title": "Tesla's pricing and production strategy", "selftext": "This post is both memorializing my thoughts and an attempt to explain Tesla's current pricing strategy as I am reading a lot of criticisms on it which, I think, is related to a misunderstanding of how technology cost decline curves work.\n\nMost of us have heard of Moore's Law which, in a nutshell, is the concept of dropping CPU prices over time. What many don't know is that Moore's Law is really just a subset of a broader observation called Wright's Law.\n\nWright's Law, in a nutshell, is the concept that as more of something is produced it gets cheaper to produce that something. Worded another way, for every doubling of the accumulated production of any good, the price of producing that good drops by some percentage. That percentage is different for different goods but the process has generally been observed for all goods.\n\nWright's Law is why the cost of new technologies tends to drop so rapidly in its early days. Think of LED televisions, cell phones, laptops, photovoltaic solar panels, etc. This isn't is a new concept, it has always been present, for example cars, refrigerators, microwave ovens, etc.\n\nThe reasons for Wright's Law can be complex and abstract but are generally attributed to economies of scale where fixed costs, like design or equipment, can be spread over a larger number of goods. These economies of scale do not just apply to the firm directly producing the final product but also applies to it's entire supply and distribution chain. Even fairly abstract costs like site permitting and employee training get spread over the larger number of produced units. You can almost think of it as \"well the factory has already been built and we have 'recovered' its cost so now every additional unit we produce is effectively 'free' from a factory cost standpoint\". That's kind of a rudimentary way of thinking about economies of scale but might be helpful for non-finance folks.\n\nThis concept is incredibly important to understand how Elon and his team are thinking about pricing and production.\n\nIn order for Tesla to bring the cost of producing vehicles down, Tesla needs to produce as many vehicles as possible in the shortest time possible. Elon thinks long term. He is more concerned with \"maximizing the area under the curve\" than he is about next quarter, or even next year's, profits. The faster they can hit 20 million vehicles per year of production then the faster wright's law kicks in and the more prices fall.\n\nFor this reason, as long as producing a car adds contribution margin, meaning it does not have negative gross margin, then it's beneficial to produce that car in the long term. Once Tesla hits some steady state of production, let's say 20 million vehicles since that's what they're targeting, then sales will stay steady and costs will drop. Gross margins should, in theory, increase from that point forward.\n\nThe above mechanics are basically a certainty. What isn't certain is whether or not other entrants will put downward pressure on what Tesla can charge which eats up their gross margin. This is what Wall St. means when the call Tesla \"just a car company\". They are betting on Tesla's margins converging with other automakers' margins because other automakers will match their cost structure and charge lower prices than Tesla because they would be willing to take lower margins. Tesla would then have to compete with these lower prices by reducing their own prices. This is how competitive markets play out. In my opinion, no legacy automaker has a chance in hell of matching Tesla's cost structure but new entrants or Chinese automakers could.\n\nAt the end of the day, Tesla's mission is to *sell* as many cars as possible and the best way to do that is to *produce* as many as possible. You, as an investor, need to decide whether you think they will be able to produce high margins when they hit steady state sales/production or whether other automakers will match their cost structure and cause margins to converge around some lower percentage.\n\nWould love to hear intelligent thoughts on this.\n\nEdit: in addition to economies of scale, companies also find ways to increase efficiencies in workflows and processes and reduce waste.

They aren’t buying shitty EV’s from the competition because it’s cheaper and they aren’t buying luxury ones from the BEV’s because they can’t afford it. \n\nTraditional OEM’s are losing money on every EV they sell so the more they decrease to compete the deeper that hole is - they have longterm contracts with parts manufacturers for ICE vehicles and now need to find and build new contracts with EV manufacturers. Essentially they are balancing profits with losses on every car they sell regardless of vehicle type.  Whilst Tesla and others purely in EV only have to worry about the future of their EV’s and how to scale successfully.  This is why for the most part they are still getting industry leading profit margins, even if it reaches below average it’s still above average EV’s lol why for the life of me analysts are comparing ICE and BEV’s in the same category is beyond me. \n\nIMO the big automakers can compete is by buying out the smaller nimble EV projects coming to market that are legitimate - see GM and Nikola for what not to do lol.  \n\nA good comparison as to what Tesla has done and is doing is replicated the Toyota playbook when they flooded the the US market with cheap affordable cars and once again the US AM’s have forgotten their history.

(Edit: rate of demand slowing in rate of increase is based upon earning statement that price cuts were made to sell vehicles. Edit made. Obviously more to unwrap here but for brevity's sake I don't.)\n\nThis decrease in demand (at least partly due to high rates/macro) was specified as THE reason for price cuts, during the earnings call.  \n\nI wrote this-I recall-in the comment, and, as we see here, it is a valid point. \n\nSo, perhaps, demand was increasing, but at steady-ish (stagnate?) delivery rates, it not REALLY increasing that much, WITH massive price cuts, intended to increase sales. [not economic demand which is a complicated economic term, misused].\n\nFurthermore they could have and still can double the capacity of all giga factories but have not done so. They could build the Mexico plant, but decided not to as stated in the earnings call. Rates were mentioned but if sales are there enough the rate/cost would not matter. \n\nI recall, and I could be wrong here, that it was stated that, besides rates, they chose not to expand because the demand was not there. \n\n\n-I'm not sure how your comment on factory expansion relates to post-\n\nI think I just explained it in response to your statement that factory/production expansion is \"massively\" increasing.\n\n-just because they want to produce as many cars as possible doesn't mean they can-\n\nTrue but you are conflating \"can\" with \"want\" interchangeably in that statement. \n\nThey absolutely CAN increase production seen by the fact they stated that they chose not to. \n\nThey do NOT WANT to expand production. \n\nExpanding production when demand is stagnate or mildly increasing at a decreasing rate would necessitate decreased prices, and possibly lead to a loss of the expansion-based increased volume cost. that is most of the extra units being sold could lose money. Reference cyber truck (mostly all original parts) loses money until 250k unit, which can't be done until 2025.\nIf your production is too high above demand you could lose money. \n\n(Note that current decreasing prices are not related to this utterance of decreasing prices.

What I am saying is that the two things are nearly unrelated. Both impact resale value independently.\n\nObviously Tesla can't cut prices too much more, too fast, or they'd be in negative margin territory (they've been cutting prices at 3x the rate of COGS reductions so far this year).

Some people may not be vocal about it, or may simply accept their lumps, but it's definitely an impact. Look at Hertz's Q3 earnings where they specifically blamed drops in residual values of their Tesla fleet as one of several factors driving underperformance. Strong residual value has been a core piece of Tesla's TCO (total cost of ownership) story for several years now, and a forecast of continous cost declines undermines that. You can blame the dumb consumer for not foreseeing it, but handwaving over it and pretending it doesn't exist is just fooling yourself.\n\n> Certainly not big enough to prevent them from doing it.\n\nLol, Elon does all sorts of stuff that has negative impacts to one part of the business or another.

The reason I say this is that building factories is very cash-intensive. Perhaps 10B per factory. If they get to 1M cars per annum per factory, you are looking at needing another 15+ factories. This translates into 150B in capital costs which impacts cash flow. Right now they are spending about 75% of their net operating cash flow on capital investments which allows them to increase their cash position. \n\nSo, whatever formula you figure out for \"how fast\" they can get to a 20M per year production rate needs to consider cash flow.\n\nIt also needs to consider macroeconomic trends. High interest rates are suppressing large capital purchases from consumers. No one wants to pay 10% for an auto loan, and understandably so.

Things like material shortfalls, recently enacted regulations, or increases in shipping costs could make the seats more expensive.\n\nAs for production being determined by contribution margins, it's another difficult, dynamic concept that you're treating as a constant. If this were easy for you to achieve, a company would be paying an ungodly amount of money for your abilities. There are a bunch of factors that could force Tesla to continue production even though it decreases the per unit contribution.
