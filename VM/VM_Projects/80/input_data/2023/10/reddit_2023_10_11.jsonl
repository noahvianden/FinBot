If the contract isn't exercised, the contract could be written again next month for more passive income. I understand this strategy places a cap on the maximum rate of return, but for the average investor this makes way more logical sense to me than risk-free investments (t-bills, CDs, HYSA), (given they have the initial capital outlay to have 100 shares of a company within a diversified portfolio). I know that this is disregarding taxes that would lower these figures, but they would still be higher than risk-free investments.\n\nAm I missing something or is this a passive income method logical?", "id": "175pjt9", "created_utc": 1697059868.0, "score": 26, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 121, "comments": [{"body": "Covered calls (CC) work when two things are true:\n1.

I think this is a poor way of looking at it.\n\nI think the mentality should be, \"make today better than yesterday.\" I'll take the big crash at the beginning of the pandemic as an example.\n\nLet's say I bought 100 shares of AAPL on Feb 14, 2020 at $81.24. For a few weeks I sell covered calls at a strike of $82 for whatever premium.\n\nThen by March 20, 2020, it has dropped to $57.31 and stays below $80 until May 29...\n\nSome people got spooked and sold their shares at a loss in that time to try to stop the bleeding. Others held but did not sell covered calls in that time. The first way leaves you significantly worse off than you were in February. The second way leaves you making no return until May and you had no way of knowing that it would recover by May.\n\nI think it makes more sense to start selling covered calls at 60-65. That way you make some premium back and if you do get called out, then you are at least better off than you were at the bottom at $57.31.  (That's the \"yesterday\" in my rule above.)\n\nObviously if you get called out at 60, then you are worse off than at the beginning of February. But you are not doing as poorly as you would be doing if you sold at the bottom and you are not as bad off as you would be if you just sat silent without knowing when things would recover. And you have enough cash to buy another 100 shares at near the price you got called out at and you start selling covered calls again.\n\nI know people who sold at the bottom with several stocks and lost so much that they felt like it just wouldn't be worth it to get back in.\n\nIf you keep thinking that you can't get back in unless your next trade will recover all your losses in one trade, then you will never recover anything.\n\nBut if you make a smart trade that leaves you better off than you were yesterday, then you are on your way to being back on top.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "This is a good realization but a risky strategy on a single contract.  If you sell calls below your put strike you are adding in upside risk.   The risk is the stock rebounds and you are now forced to sell your stocks at a capital loss that would offset all the premiums you've collected.  I would only do this on a single contract if you have given up on the stock and you are willing to take the capital loss and move on to another trade.  \n\nA better strategy is to sell a bracket if you have enough collateral.  Sell a covered call and a new lower put for the same expiration.  This helps hedge your call since only one of them can finish in the money on the ex date.  It doubles your downside risk so you better like the stock long term.  I do this to average my way into stocks I want to own.  With the recent downturn, I have a several stock positions with strike floors 5% apart.  For example, I have TSM at $97 and at $94.  I have DIS at $99 and at $89.  Assuming these rebound, I can sell calls against just the lower positions or average the whole lot.    \n\n\nOne other strategy if you have multiple contracts at the same strike is to split them.  I did this with RIVN earlier this year.  I was put in at $18.50 for 6 contracts and stock dropped down into the $14-15 range.  I sold 3 calls at various strikes below $18.50 until I got called away at $15 when the stock rebounded quickly.   I stacked the $3.50 capital loss on the other 3 contracts.  Since the stock was shooting upwards I was able to sell the remaining 3 contracts at $22 which meant I made exactly $0 in capital gains.   Along the way, I made $2093 in premiums so it was a good recovery method for that stock.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Forgive me for being confused, but I'm not sure how selling puts got into the discussion.\n\nI'm interested to learn though!\n\nI was just talking about selling a call against 100 shares (or multiples).\n\nCan you explain how this works with the Disney shares you mentioned? You are selling a call with a strike of 99 and a put with a strike of 89... What was your purchase price? Or are you talking about selling naked options?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Sorry.  I rarely buy stocks to sell options.  I wheel into them by selling cash secured puts until they drop into the money and I get assigned the stocks at a discount.  The strike price of my put is the lowest I will sell a covered call for.   I call it a \"put strike\" because it isn't the actual cost basis of the stock.  I know I can sell a call at my cost basis but the accounting is easier if I just use the \"put strike\".     By using the \"put strike\" as my minimum call level, I can ensure all premiums are profit.   It is essentially the purchase price of the stock so I could call it that too I suppose.\n\nAs for DIS, over the last few months,  I was \"put in\"  for 200 shares at $99 and 200 shares at $89.  If was more confident in Bob Iger, I would have sold another pair of puts for $79.  That's how I enter or \"wheel into\" a stock position.   After a brief period below $80, DIS closed at $84.35 on Friday.  The premium for $89 calls isn't great with DIS at this level.  So a bracket would be to sell two 10/27 87.00 C and two 10/27 $83 P.  To do this, I need to add an additional $16,600 in capital to the position.  That capital is cash sitting in my money market fund collecting 5% interest.\n\nIf DIS stays between $83 and $87 on 10/27, both options expire and I keep my premiums and my shares, rinse and repeat.\n\nIf DIS drops below $83 on 10/27, I'm buying another 200 shares (assignment) but my $87 call expires and I keep my premiums and my existing shares.\n\nIf DIS finishes above $87 on 10/27, my shares get called away and I will realize a loss of $2 per share($89-$87=$2) .  I usually add that $2 loss to the other shares in my position so my $99 shares would now have a floor of $101. My $83  put expires worthless so I get to keep the premium.  \n\nI could also just sell one bracket (1 put and 1 call) and if I get called away at $87, I could just add two dollars to the remaining $89 contract making it a $91.   Since the stock would have to have upward momentum and be above $87 in order for the first call to finish in the money,  a $91 call would also be in range at that point.  This is what I will likely do this week.  \n\n  \nIt sounds more complicated than it is.

Here is my take: it is actually riskier to not sell covered calls. Let me explain.  I buy 100 shares of xyz stock at $100 per share.  I then proceed to sell a 30 DTE covered call at $110 for lets say $1.50.  If the stock rockets to $130, well shit.  I take the $10 in appreciation and the $1.50 in premium.  I just made 11.5% return in 30 days.  If the stock tanks, I collect the $1.50 and move on.  Even if the stock tanks, I’m still bag holding whether I sold the call or not.\n\nBottom line is that selling covered calls helps create predictable streams of income.  Yes I may miss out on stocks that rocket to the upside, but if I can make a consistent 1-2% per month, I’m at 12-24% annualized, which compounded over 20,30,40 years, etc will make you stupid fucking rich even if you start with a small initital investment.\n\nOne last note, I’d highly recommend looking into the wheel strategy —> 1. Sell a put on a stock you like and take assignment if the share price drops. 2. Sell a covered call above your costs basis. 3.

The premium you collect lowers your cost basis so if the stock tanks, you don't lose quite as much as if you didn't write the call.   Upside risk is imaginary if the call strike is higher than your purchase price.  Equating missing out on some profit vs taking a loss is a false analogy.  \n\nTesla is very volatile so option writing against it is exciting to say the least.  From 1/25/23 to 5/26/23 I wheeled TSLA.  I sold weekly puts until I was assigned and then sold calls at or above my put strike until I was called away.  That's the wheel in a nutshell.  During that four month period, my tracker shows I made $2,735.52 in put/call premiums.  I owned 100 shares of TSLA twice and made $500 total gain between assignment and being called away.  Assuming the capital at risk averaged out to $18,500, it comes out to about 17% return over a 4 month period when the stock bounced around a lot but didn't make a big move in either direction.   That's a good example of a good outcome of option trading.  \n\nIn May when TSLA was in the 160's, I started wheeling it in another account (IRA) starting with Put at $160.  The stock rallied that month and I kept selling Puts against but never wound up owning the stock.   In that account, I've made $2,739.32 but I sometimes held two puts at the same time at different price points.  Assuming the average capital at work was $30,000, it only comes out to 9% return over that period.  \n\nSo can you make money wheeling a stock like Tesla?  Sure.  It's volatility can be put to work as part of the strategy.  Several times I was able to roll calls out and up with a weekly profit to capture more gain.  Same thing with Puts.  I was able to roll them out and down which reduced my downside risk and generated a weekly profit.  \n\nHowever, if had just bought 100 shares of Tesla on 1/25/23 for $143 and held them until today, I would be sitting on $10,800 in capital gains right now.   So it becomes a case of a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.  I made $5,500 in small cash payments over a 9 month period which I stashed in a money market and made a few hundred more  in dividends.  The returns are all realized and sitting in my bank.  I certainly didn't lose anything by doing this.  However, there are those that will rightly say \"But you left $5K on the table.\"  True but to collect that $5K, I would have to sell at some point and hope I get the timing right.  \n\nTesla's earnings are next week.  I currently hold the 10/20 230.00 P which is a $21 discount off today's price and around $32 discount off of when I sold the put.  If I wind up with TSLA next Friday, it will be at a steep discount from where it is today.  If I don't own it, I will likely be able to buy back my put at pennies on the dollar.   I like the control options give me and I'm willing to sacrifice some upside gain for consistent realized returns.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for your response.
