Guess he likes the dividends?\n\n**Warren Buffett bought about $2.5 billion worth of Citigroup**\n\n***June 25, 2022***\n\nAccording to his latest 13F filing, Warren Buffett has deployed roughly one-third of his cash into new investments during the first three months of the year.\n\nAs always, Buffett’s biggest swings are noteworthy. However, his decision to sell most of his bank stocks while adding Citigroup (ticker: C) to Berkshire Hathaway’s (ticker: BRK/A, BRK/B) portfolio is puzzling Wall Street.\n\n**Buffett loves banks**\n\nBuffett is deeply familiar with banking and financial services. He believes the business is relatively straightforward and can be extremely lucrative if managed well.\n\n“If you can just stay away from following the fads, and really making a lot of bad loans, banking has been a remarkably good business in this country,” he told Berkshire Hathaway investors in 2003.\n\nThis year, Buffett has completely sold most of his banking and financial services investments. Only a few banks remain in the portfolio. But that doesn’t mean the love affair with financial services is over.\n\n**Citigroup’s transformation**\n\nCitigroup has lagged behind its peers. Over the past five years, the stock is down over 28%.\n\nCompare that to Bank of America’s 33% return over the same period. Even the SPDR S&P Bank ETF (ticker: KBE) is up 3%.\n\nThe company is now attempting a turnaround to catch up. Last year, Citigroup’s board appointed Jane Fraser as the new CEO — making her the first female leader of a major U.S. bank.\n\nAccording to a filing revealed in May 2022, Berkshire Hathaway, led by Buffett, added more than 55 million shares of Citigroup, building a stake worth approximately $2.95 billion. This move came at a time when Citigroup’s stock was underperforming its own banking sector. The purchase marked a significant new and contrarian investment in the financial sector by Berkshire Hathaway.\n\n**Citigroup Yield**\n\nCitigroup currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.5300. Here is some recent dividend history:\n\n***On August 4, 2023, Citigroup paid a dividend of $0.53001.***\n\n***On April 28, 2023, the dividend was $0.51001.***\n\n***On February 3, 2023, the dividend was also $0.51001.***\n\nBerkshire Hathaway owns more than 55 million shares of Citigroup. If we assume that Citigroup continues to pay a dividend of $0.53 per share (the most recent dividend), then the annual dividend income for Berkshire Hathaway from Citigroup would be:\n\n**Annual Dividend Income**\n\nBerkshire Hathaway would receive approximately **$116.6 million in dividend income** each year from Citigroup, assuming the dividend rate and the number of shares remain constant.\n\n\\*\n\n**Stock Price Capital Appreciation vs Dividend Income**\n\nCapital appreciation and dividend income are two primary ways investors can earn money from their investments in stocks. Here’s how they differ:\n\nCapital Appreciation: This refers to the increase in the price of a stock over time. If an investor buys a stock at $10 per share and sells it 10 years later for $20 per share, the $10 increase is capital appreciation. This is often the result of the company’s growth and increased earnings, which make the stock more attractive to other investors, driving up its price. However, capital appreciation is not realized until the stock is sold, and the stock’s price can fluctuate significantly over time due to various factors such as market conditions, economic indicators, and company performance.\n\nDividend Income: Some companies distribute a portion of their earnings back to shareholders in the form of dividends. These are typically paid on a regular basis (such as quarterly) and are expressed as a fixed amount per share. For example, if a company pays an annual dividend of $1 per share and an investor owns 1000 shares, they will receive $1000 in dividend income that year. Dividend income provides a steady stream of income regardless of the stock’s price fluctuations.\n\nFor a long-term investor holding a stock for 10 or more years, both capital appreciation and dividend income can significantly affect their total return:\n\nCapital appreciation can lead to substantial gains if the company performs well, and its stock price increases over time. However, it also involves more risk as the stock’s price could decrease.\n\nDividend income provides regular returns to the investor, and can be particularly attractive in stable or declining markets. It also offers the opportunity for reinvestment (an investor can use dividends to buy more shares of the stock), potentially leading to greater capital appreciation, and additional dividend income in the future.\n\nBoth capital appreciation and dividend income have their own advantages and play crucial roles in an investor’s portfolio. The importance of each will depend on the individual investor’s financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment strategy.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Warren hasn't liked bank stocks for awhile, he hasn't bought much in the past decade, relatively speaking.
