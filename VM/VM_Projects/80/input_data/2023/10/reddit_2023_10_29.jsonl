Yes.\n\nHold?  No.\n\nPre-Covid, PayPal had a great growth factor.  At one point it was the only payment method on eBay, now they are separated.  \n\nAt one point online, it was more or less the only safe way to pay.  Not other selling platforms (grailed, poshmark, etc.) allow credit cards.  It's easier for buyers.  Why force a buyer to sign up for PayPal, when they can just put their card on the site. \n\nAt one point they were embedding itself into checkouts at physical stores, now it's the same problem as before.  It's easier to swipe or tap your card than it is to login into paypal and pay.  \n\nBasically there isn't anything unique about Paypal.  Credit cards use to allow you to make virtual cards, or shopsafe or whatever but now they even got rid of those because they have better safety protections.\n\nProblem with paypal is they don't take risks.  If you sell a bit ($2,500), they will freeze your account and ask you for receipts for all items.  Even if you don't have disputes.  Even if you send them legit receipts, someone will shrugs and just ban you for life because you are \"too risky\".  They don't want a 6 month account selling $1,000 a month.  To sell $1,000 a month you'll have to slowly build the account up over a two year span.\n\nThat is the fundamental flaw in PayPal, they don't like taking risks.  Amazon, etc. will spend millions or billions on something in beta.  Paypal wil not.  PayPal is essentially the same it was when it was created 25 years ago.\n\nIt's not a growth stock nor does it deserve that evaluation.  To me it's a dying retail stock - think Dicks or Footlocker.  \n\nIn order for me to consider buying, I need to see innovation and risk and unfortunately, that is just not PayPal.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "It’s going up when youtube finance advisors sell.

What we know for sure is that they have headwinds and those headwinds could either be dramatically overstated or could materialise in decreased profitability and growth of PYPL going forward.\n\nWhat we know is that it's valued like a value stock at this point despite being in a growing sector of the economy and historically being a growth company. Modest assumptions over the mid to long-term will likely result in above market returns by my calculations. And if they return to double digit growth without a hit to profitability you could be looking at a 2-3x return over the next few years.\n\nIf growth continues to slow and and margins continue to be put under pressure it might even continue to fall be a lot of negativity is already priced in at this point. There are also theoretically limits to how low a stock like PYPL should trade in the near-term. If PYPL goes much lower then management could support the stock price with buy backs. However long-term their ability to support the stock will depend on their ability to maintain and grow future cashflows.\n\nThe way I look at PYPL as someone who's recently brought a small position is that they're one of the larger players in this space, they have a strong brand and a lot of history behind them. All payment processors are under a lot of pressure right now and if you're going to make a bet on the space PYPL is probably one of the better bets to make given their brand, their diversified product offering, size and profitability. My bet here is that some smaller players are not going to make it and PYPL will then be in a good position to either acquire those competitors, or simply absorb their market share.\n\nIt's also reasonably valued so at the very least, I think if you can hold through the current volatility the odds of the current price being a good entry price is fairly high.\n\nJust remember stocks tend to follow momentum near-term. If momentum is negative you should assume that the stock price will continue to decline until some catalyst changes market sentiment. When that happens you end up with a META / NVDA / NFLX situation where the momentum reverses so rapidly it's hard to get in at a good price.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Whos to say if its undervalued?
