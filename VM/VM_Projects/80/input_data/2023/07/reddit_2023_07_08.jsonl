They currently cannot close the deal due to a PI. Jusge could remove the PI as soon as Sunday or Monday. Then there is a 5 business day cooldown during which the FTC could appeal. Deal deadline is July 18th. \n\nWhile Microsoft has clearly outperformed the FTC, there are risks that the judge would rule in favor of the FTC due to her and Lina Khan being both named by Biden. \n\nI have a shit ton of calls for next week with limited number of put protection so I’ll either make 100K or lose like 60K.
