Also because banking concentration in Brazil was very high, 5 big banks got pretty much all market share of people and business on banking services. 2 of the banks are state-owned (Banco do Brasil and Caixa Econ√¥mica Federal), other 3 are private (Ita√∫, Santander and Bradesco). The last reason to choose Brazil was because it's a very big market to try.\n\nTheir strategy worked, they started with only one service, a credit card and no physical stores and over 10 years grew to many services, including investments, cripto, checking account, insurance, loan, business services, etc. And the number of clients also grew a lot, up to 80 million, that is more than 30% Brazil's population.\n\nAnd they received so much funding they didn't worry much about profits for a long time, only spending to grow their services. It's worth to notice that they never spent much on advertisement, they always had a customer service so much better than the other banks that they basically grew by word of mouth.\n\nWith the funding, in the last 4 years they also started expanding to other Latin American countries, Mexico and Bolivia. Mexico is growing very fast and they say faster than their growth in Brazil. Bolivia is just starting but I don't see why it won't go the same way.\n\nThey still have zero agencies/stores and their software UI is very praised among Brazilians as the best and easy to work with UI. Their cost to maintain a customer is always $0,80, regardless of how many customer they gain every year. That shows their software is very scalable.\n\nTalking about software, they use a specific programming language because they wanted to reduce the chances of bugs in their solutions, so they do a lot of work using a functional approach instead of a procedural one. And they even bought the software language company to make sure it will keep evolving. They never had a problem of data breach or funds misplacement I can remember, other Fintech competitors had some of these same problems in the meantime.\n\nThey just started to be profitable, probably because the stock fell a lot after the IPO and they received criticism around not having proved themselves as a profitable company.
