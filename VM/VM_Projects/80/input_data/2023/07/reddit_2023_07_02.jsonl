Mostly buying shares and selling covered calls (which also serves for an exit strategy when you hit acceptable gains) for steady income‚Ä¶ and also collecting the hefty dividend in PBRs case. I still have exposure to crypto but limited. And I opened a traditional and Roth IRA.  Still growing and learning. \nI learned a hard lesson at the beginning, don‚Äôt use advanced trading strategies without a grasp of it. Granted it was an unprecedented time in march of 2020, but I used it to push myself to learn and get better and to prepare for market instability.\nStarted with oil and ended with oil, honestly is just a coincidence ü§∑üèª", "id": "14owb47", "created_utc": 1688324752.0, "score": 257, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 82, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|3|**First Seen In WSB**|10 months ago\n**Total Comments**|89|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Most roads lead back home", "score": 79, "replies": [{"body": "I don‚Äôt know what roads you drive, but most of them do not lead me back home", "score": 37, "replies": [{"body": "Maybe he lives in Rome?", "score": 15, "replies": []}, {"body": "All roads lead back home though..?", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "The only acceptable road is Wendy‚Äôs.

So if RAD continues in a trajectory similar to amazon, also being a pharmacy, there's no telling what it would be worth. And the reason I've been so criticized for talking about it, and for all institutions and websites saying to avoid it, should just show that its a conspiracy.  \n\n\nand if we go to believe its a conspiracy, then we kno the people behind the curtain love numbers. Numbers and their meaning. I personally hate the stuff, but \"they\" believe numerology is real. And It must be because it is tied into our language even. Plus its pretty obvious they control us with numbers.  \n\n\nthe market cap changed in the past couple days also, it went from 86.9M to 85.21M. Just look at the difference between what numberology says about the two numbers, \n\n86- The number 86 vibration loves organizing social events and mobilizing large groups of people. It gives an ability to be service-minded, loving, and to have strong self-control. It has an excellent aesthetic sense and goes into detail, as well as being able to see the overall picture. ([https://www.numerologistpro.com/numerology-numbers/numerology-number-86-meaning/](https://www.numerologistpro.com/numerology-numbers/numerology-number-86-meaning/))\n\n9-9 is the strongest and most masculine of all the numbers and gives inner strength, power, and the ability to focus one's energies. 9 resonates with the planet Mars also known as Ares. Mars was the Roman God of war and was strong physically and mentally. 9 is the number of the warrior and gives a strong will, determination, and independence in dealing with all aspects of life, always going for the essence of things. But it can also be full of heart and very sensitive, which is reflected in Ares's dual nature as both a strong warrior and a sensitive dancer. ([https://www.numerologistpro.com/numerology-numbers/numerology-number-9-meaning/](https://www.numerologistpro.com/numerology-numbers/numerology-number-9-meaning/))\n\nv.s\n\n85- The number 85/4 vibration is called a \"world conqueror,\" just like the number 58/4, and like 58/4, 85/4 wishes to conquer the world with its new and genius ideas. 85 is more controlled and thinks more about the consequences of its actions. This number gives an interest in politics, business, and expansion, both materially and in terms of influence. Because the 85 has a digit sum 13/4, it does things in its own unique way. But at the same time, we have the number 8, which is very \"traditional\" and likes to do things in the same way as they have been done for generations. This exciting blend between traditional and new gives the number 85/4 the ability to succeed through a very original career. It could, for example, introduce something revolutionary into a very traditional career path or create something revolutionary, but in a traditional way. ([https://www.numerologistpro.com/numerology-numbers/numerology-number-85-meaning/](https://www.numerologistpro.com/numerology-numbers/numerology-number-85-meaning/))\n\n21-21 gives knowledge, diligence, and the ability to achieve great success after putting in a significant amount of effort. The number 21 is a magical number that symbolizes the entire universe and that you can crack the code of success. With 21/3, you have innate intelligence and the ability to get results with all that you do.

Plus people say I'm trynna get rid of my shares by shilling. which I'm not. I have 2500 @ 1.52, so If I wanna back out at their Lowest of lowes, I can break even I'm fine. I truly believe this is the ultimate buy and hold they dont want us in on. They've been planning it since at least before covid and I dont believe they are far from pulling it. as you can see, their current market caps numerology meaning (\"their\" favorite language) It basically says after significant due diligence, along with planning and effort, its time to take over the world lol. \n\nI dont even feel like I'm that correct about this is more of a shot in the dark. However, I feel like IF the conspiracy of the world being ran by the bankers and the federal reserve, and pvt military industrial complex is real. Then this is the stock for longevity and infinite gains. Planned and plotted by those same elite, long ago. So long ago that's why they made it the original \"MEME STOCK\" \n\nthey wanted retail investors to be so cuckolded, and hold so much animosity for this stock, that when it became time for them to start scaling it up, retail is going to look at it as the boy who cried wolf and they arent going to jup in on it until its too late. You can call me crazy. And If I lose my 4k investment. I'll just watch it all the way to the bottom because thats how much I feel it may be real.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd they always say no risk no reward.
