{"title": "Intel - not overvalued amid this euphoric market", "selftext": "Let's summarize the reasons why INTC is at the current price:\n\n* \\- Lagging behind in technology\n* \\- Poor track record of management\n* \\- In the middle of a pivotal moment in their history\n* \\- Losing market share in most segments\n* \\- Record low profits amid market saturation and supply chain issues\n* \\- Their AI portfolio misses most of the AI golden rush\n* \\- Alternative architecture ARM is customizable and this spiked in demand these days\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStill, let's underline some facts:\n\n**Market valuation landscape:**\n\n* \\- Up in the value chain, the only competitor is AMD. AMD is 5 times smaller in size, yet has bigger market cap. And remember AMD outsources its fabs, with this info alone you can estimate that the apples-to-apples difference in valuation is 25-fold.\n* \\- In the fab front, TSMC is valued 5 times higher than Intel. For reference it has 40% less employees.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\nCurrently everything depends on whether INTC will pull out two moves successfully:\n\n* \\- Transitioning to a third party fab model (partly becoming another TSMC)\n* \\- Catching up to TSMC's tech\n\nThey have plenty of resources to do that, however it will not be done overnight and the clock is ticking.\n\nEverything else (mobile processors, graphics cards, AI) is important and on the right track, but they are secondary and we shouldn't worry too much.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Management:**\n\nThe CEO is the best they had in a decade by far. CEO is committed to the new strategy, and made INTC lead efforts in supply chain stability, which should not be understated, as this is of high strategic value for countries and partners alike.\n\nIf they execute their strategy swiftly, they will be at least remotely comparable to their rivals in market valuation. If they hit several bumps, the current valuation would not seem overvalued.\n\nWe already have positive things to say about their execution:\n\n* \\- They secured preferential treatment from ASML for next gen litography ahead of what TSMC can do.\n* \\- They approached the 10 biggest clients in the fab business and some already jumped in the bandwagon. Some, like NVIDIA, gave signs they are likely to join.\n* \\- 25% of their Xeon are used for AI workloads and have competitive offers in graphics cards.\n* \\- I noticed that the satisfaction regarding Intel-branded products has increased lately, due to competitors becoming greedy with their last successes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Irrational fears:**\n\n* \\- The fear that AMD will leave INTC in the dust due to the rapid growth of their market share:\n\nHey, it's one thing to believe that catching up is gonna make the parity even, and it's a completely different thing to defend that AMD has some kind of superpower or INTC an unforgiveable defficiency that will lead to an uneven outcome over the long term. 50-50 seems natural.\n\n* \\- Intel performance disappointed me / I had losses with this stock:\n\nRelatable, but it's not wise to make decisions on these terms.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNgl, this is a long game, but it doesn't look like a bad starting position, especially if we consider the already saturated alternatives.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Thank you for your points of view, they give me more to think about. After all, my goal is to make the most fair case and orient my thoughts, as I see no good or current publication about this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "15curb0", "created_utc": 1690643775.0, "score": 76, "upvote_ratio": 0.77, "num_comments": 97, "comments": [{"body": "Not sure if I find your arguments convincing\n\n\\---\n\n* AMD outsourcing fabs is a \"negative\" for AMD.

After that it will continue growing like it did in the previous years.\n\nWhy we can assume this:\n\nRevenue took a dip in 2022/23 due to supply problems, inventory corrections and saturation of some markets. AMD gained a couple points of market share during this crisis only because they managed this problem slightly better than Intel. That is to say, the problem is not collapsing market share. Revenue kept growing all these years despite steadily losing market to AMD. If there was a halt in that trend, revenue growth could even go up.\n\nThe recovery of this market is bound to happen by the end of 2024 (to 2020 levels).\n\n**Costs:**\n\nI expect costs to stagnate during the current year (production still below capacity, low growth, cost-saving measures), which is safe to say. After that, they will continue to grow at the same rate revenue does (above historical trend for extra safety).\n\n\\------\n\nUnder these circumstances, Net income (excluding equity in affiliates) will be 17B at the end of next year, still below 2020 levels. Nonetheless, that's a forward PE ratio of 8 (and that's only on the business they've been running till now).\n\nStill, NI and Cash flow might take an additional year to fully recover due to new heavy expenditure in new plants and equipment and technology lag, but otherwise we have a solid track record of positive free cash flow that was briefly interrupted during this crisis.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat you said about INTC not dominating the world is correct.

Intel is overbought similar to the market in the last Q, and neither their result nor their track record prompt any optimism regarding massive growth. \n\nEven if you want argue that they are not overvalued that is fine, but to say that Intel is going to some path for multiple expansions in utterly ridiculous, or \"**if you buy it, you get free tickets to benefit from the evolution of their foundry business, which could be a game changer.\"** \n\nWhich sounds like something you pulled out of ChatGPT.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I think OP's predictions are in the (paradise) neighbourhood of the estimates the company provided in the past.

Fun fact, ASML is nothing without the patents they got when they acquired SVG circa 2000. The method of generating the EUV light/laser was created by US National Labs and domestic semiconductor companies, resulting in Congress creating a company called EUV LLC to license it to the private sector. So the US has the IP to make an EUV scanner. They just don't have a company that operates in that field anymore. Also other fun fact, some of the biggest shareholders in ASML are their own customers.
