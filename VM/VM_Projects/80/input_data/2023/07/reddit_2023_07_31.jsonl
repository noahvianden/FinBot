{"title": "My One Year Result Doing Weekly Strangle Only", "selftext": "Started last August 1st 2022 doing weekly strangles with 60k in capital.   I was a total newbie, never bought or sold a call or put before.  I was introduced to short strangle by my investment broker, it's a long story.  You can find my old post about it last year before I dived in.   Here are my results:\n\n* Aug 22 - 2,193 profit\n* Sept -  1,506\n* Oct - 2,037\n* Nov - 2,017\n* Dec -  (6,539) loss\n* Jan 23 - (241)\n* Feb - 2,673\n* March - 3,329\n* April - 610\n* May - 606\n* June - 2,145\n* July - 1,641\n\nPast 12 month - 11,978\n\n2022 - 1,215\n\n2023 up to end of July - 10,763\n\nI mainly trade TSLA and QQQ, occasionally NVDA, META.  When I started in 2022, I experimented with ADBE, AVGO, COST, MRNA, PANW and SNOW...I have net loss of 1,150 with those.    TSLA accounted for 70% of the profit, QQQ accounts for 20% and NVDA accounts for the last 10%.    It's not diversified; I am not sure what I would do if and when TSLA becomes untradeable.    \n\nI open position at every Friday around 12:30 pm, usually 3 contract on TSLA, 2 contract on QQQ and 1 contract on various (NVDA at the moment) at 10 to 12 delta.   The premium could be 600 to 1,000 depending on the week.  My goal is try to make 500 to 600 per week, or 2,000 per month.   At the end of month, I withdraw the profit, any amount over my initial of 60k.   I finally paid my tuition in Dec 2022 when I lost 7,500 in one week.  TSLA has gotten so cheap, I was opening 7 to 8 contracts every week.   Learned my lesson:  SIZING, SIZING AND SIZING.   I did not withdraw any profit until May of 2023 when I finally got back to my initial capital of 60k.   \n\nI think I did okay, I profited 10 out the 12 month, about 20% return overall.   I added another 30k today so I am hoping for better results in the next 12 month now I have paid my tuition and got one year of trading under my belt.   I believe what I am doing works (until it doesn't, yeah I know).      It's just a hobby, I am not trading with my life savings.  If I lose them all, I can handle it.   This method fits my personality.  It's a very structured system; I don't have to guess market going up or down.     \n\nI posted questions, read and learned a lot on this forum when I started as a newbie.   if any newbie has questions, fire away.....I am happy to answer any questions.

Once one or the other strike has been breached, the underlying just keeps moving against one adjusted leg or the other, until no further adjustment is possible (i.e., can't roll to within 60 days for a credit while keeping the underlying between my breakevens) and I'm forced to close for a loss.
