{"title": "For the First Time in Six Decades, Net Interest Payments are Moving Opposite to Rates", "selftext": "US nonfinancial corporate net interest costs are the lowest in 60 years.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/LeAFFvS.jpg\n\n>Since the Federal Reserve began aggressively hiking interest rates last year, more and more economists warned that a US recession was imminent.\n\n>But that recession has not yet arrived, and there's no sign a recession is near even after reliable indicators like the inverted yield curve flashed red flags.\n\n>According to Societe Generale, \"something very strange has happened\" that explains why a US recession has been delayed, and it has to do with some timely moves made by corporations.\n\n>The bank highlighted that going back to at least 1975, corporate net interest payments would rise as the Fed raised interest rates. But for the first time in a long time, that isn't happening. Instead, as the Fed raised rates over the past 15 months, corporate net interest payments actually fell.\n\n>\"Normally when interest rates rise, so too do net debt payments, squeezing profit margins and slowing the economy. But not this time,\" Societe Generale's Albert Edwards said in a Thursday note, pointing to a chart that he called the \"strangest\" he has seen in a very long time.\n\n>So, what exactly is happening?\n\n>It turns out that during the period of near-zero interest rates, especially leading up to the pandemic and during the pandemic, corporations took advantage and refinanced a ton of their liabilities into long-term, low-rate, fixed debt.\n\n>According to data from Bank of America earlier this year, companies bought themselves some time to navigate higher rates. **The debt composition of S&P 500 companies includes just 6% in short-term floating rate debt, just 8% in long-term floating rate debt, 10% in short-term fixed debt, and a whopping 76% in long-term fixed debt.**\n\n>This \"helps explain the recession's tardiness,\" SocGen's Edwards said, highlighting that net interest payments have fallen 25% at a time when they would have risen sharply based on history.\n\n>**\"Companies have effectively played the yield curve in reverse and become net beneficiaries of higher rates, adding 5% to profits over the last year instead of deducting 10%+ from profits as usual,\" Edwards said.**\n\n>The lack of a profit decline means companies didn't have to resort to a big wave of layoffs that would have dented the economy and thrown it into a recession.\n\n>The low-rate, long-term debt held by corporations, combined with their pricing power during a time of elevated inflation, means most businesses were able to grow profits in a big way.\n\n>\"Interest rates simply aren't working as they once did. It is indeed a mad, mad world,\" Edwards concluded.\n\n>All of this could change if companies have to refinance their debt at higher rates. But with most of their debts not maturing until 2025, 2026, 2027 and beyond, it's possible that interest rates could move lower between now and then, enabling companies to continue to ride the coattails of low rates and ultimately stave off a recession.\n\nhttps://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/something-very-strange-explains-why-002654305.html\n\nEdit: Title should say just lowest in 6 decades.

There is a point where interest rates will likely cut too heavily m, but I think we are a fair ways away from that.  From here forward, I would hope the Fed takes a slow and steady approach to future rate hikes.\n\nThat said, .25% interest rate hikes every once in a while is unlikely to cause a recession on its own.  The reason it did in 2008 is because of a rapid rate of increase coupled with a mountain of bad short term debt serviced at those rates, and a truly gobsmacking amount of idiocy in the financial markets.
