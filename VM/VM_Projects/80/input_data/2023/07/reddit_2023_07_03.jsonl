{"title": "‚ÄúUS Factory Sector Continues Contraction for Eighth Straight Month, Raising Concerns of Impending Recession", "selftext": "The latest report on the US factory sector reveals a persistent slowdown throughout June, as the overall index remained in contraction territory for the eighth consecutive month. Among the details, only four out of eighteen industries experienced growth during this period. The economy is now below its pre-pandemic high, leaving little room to deny the evident slowdown.\n\nOur analysis leads us to maintain our belief that a recession is looming, with today‚Äôs report emphasizing that the goods sector of the economy is likely to be the leading contributor. Respondents of the survey in June expressed concerns about the deceleration of the US economy and more importantly, anticipated reduced demand from customers. \n\nNew orders index also remained in contraction territory for the tenth month in a row. Similarly, the production index fell back into contraction territory in June.\n\nConsumers have been shifting their preferences away from goods and toward services, further exacerbating the situation. \n\nThe combination of decreased consumer demand and accumulated inventories at retailers indicates that factory output is likely to remain sluggish. There is some positive news, as factories have managed to catch up on order backlogs due to fewer new orders and improvements in supply chains. However, the backlogs index, although showing a slight increase in June, remains near the lowest readings since the 2008 Financial Crisis.\n\nUnfortunately, the slowdown in orders and the reduction in backlogs have started to impact employment, as reflected in the employment index falling back into contraction at 48.1 in June. On the inflation front, the prices index witnessed a decline to 41.8 in June, marking the second consecutive decrease after a recent upward trend.\n\nIn conclusion, the latest report on the US factory sector presents a worrisome picture of a persistent slowdown and contraction in June. With the overall index remaining in contraction territory for the eighth consecutive month and only a few industries showing growth, it becomes increasingly difficult to deny the evident slowdown. This analysis strongly supports the belief that a recession may be on the horizon, with the goods sector likely to be the primary contributor. Respondents‚Äô concerns about the deceleration of the US economy and anticipated reduced customer demand further emphasize this outlook.\n\nOrder backlogs, which have slightly improved due to fewer new orders and supply chain enhancements, they remain near their lowest levels since the 2008 Financial Crisis.\n\nRegrettably, the impact on employment is becoming apparent, as reflected in the employment index falling back into contraction. Furthermore, the decline in the prices index suggests a possible easing of inflationary pressures.\n\nTaken together, these findings paint a challenging landscape for the US economy. The accumulation of inventories and reduced consumer demand are likely to keep output sluggish in the coming months. Vigilance and proactive measures will be essential to navigate these economic headwinds and mitigate the potential impact on various sectors of the economy.", "id": "14pq5c9", "created_utc": 1688407301.0, "score": 20, "upvote_ratio": 0.63, "num_comments": 85, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|5|**First Seen In WSB**|1 week ago\n**Total Comments**|77|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 week|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n>TL;DR: The US factory sector is in contraction, with only four out of eighteen industries growing.

{"title": "FT BREAKING: China hits back with export curbs on chip making materials", "selftext": "China is the world‚Äôs leading producer of gallium and germanium, making any reduction in its output a significant concern for the global tech industry. \nChipmaking materials are distributed globally, the control over production and supply chains can have significant implications. China‚Äôs dominance in the production of certain metals used in chipmaking, such as gallium and germanium, can impact global supply and pricing (Impacting inflation). \n\nThe geopolitical dynamics surrounding trade restrictions and export controls can affect the availability of these materials. Limited availability of these metals is likely to slow down production or result in increased prices for manufacturers and their clients in the technology, telecommunications, energy, and automotive sectors. As gallium and germanium are alternatives to traditional silicon wafers in specialized applications, their scarcity could disrupt the supply chain, impacting the production capabilities of companies reliant on these materials.\n\nGallium and germanium are among dozens of minerals classified by the US government as critical to economic and national security. The US state department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAccording to officials and experts in China, Beijing is expected to introduce further retaliatory measures in response to the expansion of US-led controls on technology exports.\n\n‚ÄúThere will be more retaliatory measures against the snowballing semiconductor export controls from western countries,‚Äù said one senior official close to the Chinese commerce ministry.\n\nConsidering Nvidia is expected to hit 11B+ in revenue for the next quarter, going from 7billion to 11billion considering their already complicated supply chain issues and this is only going to worsen the issue and make it harder for them to meet that expectation. \n\nNvidia is now ‚Äúpriced for perfection.‚Äù The bears can point to pretty much any risk and have a valid point. as a dominant player in the semiconductor industry, Nvidia is far from immune to the potential consequences of China‚Äôs export curbs. The company‚Äôs market cap of $1 trillion is largely based on its leadership in AI Chips. Nvidia could face significant challenges in maintaining its market dominance and growth trajectory.\n\nThe restrictions could impede the company‚Äôs access to critical components and hinder its ability to supply AI chips to the Chinese market, which is a major consumer of these technologies. Such restrictions would not only impact Nvidia‚Äôs revenue but also create an opportunity for competitors to gain market share in China and beyond.\n\nKim Yang-paeng, a researcher at the Korea Institute for Industrial Economics and Trade, said the restrictions were ‚Äúworrisome‚Äù for South Korean chipmakers.\n\n‚ÄúKorean companies can find alternative sources, but it will take some time‚Äâ.‚Äâ.‚Äâ.‚Äâif you lack some materials, no matter how important they are, this could hit chip production,‚Äù he said.\n\nBased on historical precedents, supply chain disruptions and export curbs have often resulted in market volatility and reduced investor confidence. If Nvidia faces difficulties in sourcing essential materials and encounters restrictions on selling AI chips to China, it could face a decline in market capitalization. The loss of Chinese customers alone, given their significant demand for AI chips, could have a substantial impact on Nvidia‚Äôs revenue and market value. Additionally, heightened geopolitical tensions may deter investors and hinder Nvidia‚Äôs expansion plans, further eroding its market cap.\n\nChina‚Äôs export curbs on gallium and germanium, along with the potential limitations on AI chip exports, pose a serious threat to Nvidia‚Äôs ability to maintain its $1 trillion market cap. The disruption to the global supply chain, which was just starting to recover. The tech sector in particular, and the uncertainty surrounding future market dynamics could undermine Nvidia‚Äôs growth and market dominance.\n\nThe recent move by China to impose export restrictions on gallium and germanium, essential metals used in chipmaking and communications equipment, has intensified the geopolitical tensions between China and the United States. These measures, aimed at safeguarding national security and interests, signify a retaliatory response to the semiconductor restrictions imposed by the US. While China‚Äôs actions may have short-term implications for Chinese manufacturers, the long-term consequences will undermine Nvidia‚Äôs ability to maintain its $1 trillion market cap.\n\nSource: https://www.ft.com/content/6dca353c-70d8-4d38-a368-b342a6450d95 [Financial Times]\n\nSource: China‚Äôs metal export curbs reverberate across Asia‚Äôs chip sector https://on.ft.com/43947NW [Financial Times]", "id": "14py14h", "created_utc": 1688425778.0, "score": 71, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 82, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|8|**First Seen In WSB**|1 week ago\n**Total Comments**|113|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 week|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Like your gf.wont give you something you like , you just need to get things done in an more expensive way", "score": 33, "replies": [{"body": "You just need a hand.", "score": 5, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "The metals aren‚Äôt particularly rare or difficult to find, both metals are byproducts from processing other commodities such as coal and bauxite.

The problem is that it is producing results that are unfavorable to the Chinese in every single one of these examples. In 2010, Japan imported 82% of its rare earth materials from China. This dependence was reduced to 58% in 2019, with the target of less than 50% in 2025. Right now, the US imports 80% of its rare earths from China, but in 5 years it will be less and in 10 years dramatically less because the US is opening its mines back up. Up until 1985, the US was the largest producer of rare earths. Those have since closed down due to the convenience of getting them from China but all of that is changing rapidly. Legislation is being passed that will restrict Chinese rare earths from government and military production.\n\nWhat Chinese have not realized is that weaponizing their dominance in certain sectors makes people want to stop dealing with Chinese anymore in those sectors. In the solar cell example, Chinese were using their access to cheap and readily mined coal without any regard for the environment to drive down costs on those cells and then dumping the market, putting many producers globally out of business. All in a loud and clear eff you to the WTO which had bent over backwards to shoehorn them in. What producers started doing in response is making low carbon solar cells to make them easier to make and with the help of governments (US and EU) passing laws requiring lower carbon cells, as well as tariffs on Chinese cells, which the WTO agreed with.\n\nThe Chinese seem to be under the mistaken impression that there are no consequences to this sort of behavior. Decoupling is happening and US investment in China is tapering off. You can add security concerns and the desire to be in a stronger position in relation to China when they attack their neighbors, engage in massive scale human rights abuses and collude with others engaged in war crimes to the list of other reasons.\n\nFinally, the US is currently building stockpiles of rare earths to fill in until the mines come back online.", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "At that time, Japan sued China at the WTO, which led to China's relaxation of restrictions.\n\nBut now the WTO mechanism has been destroyed by the United States, and the alliance formed by the United States has imposed various trade restrictions on China,\n\nThe WTO arbitration mechanism is now defunct.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "US starts weaponize industry first", "score": -2, "replies": [{"body": "When do you believe the US first started?", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Can't all kind of measures taken by the US to directly harm Chinese semiconductors industry lately be taken as weaponising?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Yes, but this started long ago (roughly a decade), between Japan and China", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "The US has 0 reserves", "score": -10, "replies": [{"body": "According to the US Geological Survey, it does.\n\nhttps://www.usgs.gov/news/technical-announcement/usgs-updates-mineral-database-gallium-deposits-united-states\n\nhttps://www.usgs.gov/data/germanium-deposits-united-states", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "Having 2 places that you can start mining it is not the same as having a stockpile of it in ready-to-use form, unfortunately.", "score": 4, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "> This stock is priced for perfect conditions.\n\nThe stock is priced according to the principles of the market efficiency theory.
