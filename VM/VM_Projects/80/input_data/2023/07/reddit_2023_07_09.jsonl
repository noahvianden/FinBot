Now, the money typically comes from banks, but **it's not the investment firm that borrows the money; it's the company getting acquired.**  \n>  \n>So there are lots of ways the Twitter deal didn't resemble a typical leveraged buyout. Take, for example, who's doing the acquiring. There's no investment firm involved, just Elon. He and some co-investors put up their own money for most of the 44 billion. **The remaining amount, 13 billion, was borrowed from a group of banks. That's the money Twitter is now on the hook for.**  \n>  \n>Elon has already talked about bankruptcy. If that were to happen, the banks could go after Twitter's assets, not Elon's, because, remember, he's not the one who borrowed the money.

I don’t base that on any inside info on the financing structure, just based on his behavior and Twitter’s financials even before threads was announced. In fact I think threads is hugely detrimental to Elon for another reason entirely.\n\nEver since he was forced into this deal (yes, forced) he has been desperate to pump numbers and show cost cutting. Like “look at me I’m a genius on a different level I’ll turn this company around in a couple of weeks.” He immediately started tweeting how engagement was at all time levels and sought to stir up controversy. But in reality Twitter was never going to scale beyond a certain point of engagement because of the nature of its users which are mostly journalists and self promoters which seems to have topped out at around 300 million and the ad revenue has been trending sideways for years. It’s just not a great business. In fact as a Twitter user who really just casually scrolls for news I can see that it’s a complete bubble where the users believe it’s tremendously valuable while most people in the real world don’t even use it because they’re on Instagram. I honestly do not know one person in real life who is an active Twitter user.\n\nOkay that’s a bit of a rant but the point is to level set that Twitter is just a shitty business. Now why is threads detrimental outside pulling users (which I actually have my doubts about)? Because it became apparent to me early on that everything Elon was doing- pumping sub numbers, firing people to cut costs, hiring the woman from nbc as CEO- was leading to one outcome- to take Twitter public again and dump his bags onto the market to free himself from this entanglement. In fact I felt that installing a replacement CEO was the final step and so an ipo was imminent any day.\n\nThen Zuck came along and just completely shit all over his plans at the eleventh hour. Dude is truly much better at this game than Elon and I think has been planning this since Elon took over to hit them when they’re at their weakest. So maybe Elon still tries to take Twitter public but the reality is that having a competitor like meta that has a third of the user numbers in a few days (although probably not actually a third of the same users actively moving over wholesale) is going to diminish the value greatly and help ensure that Elon still takes a major hit on this deal. Twitter is likely worth less than half of what he paid and that’s even in an IPO market that has been heating back up.\n\nAlso, the number of people in this thread just dismissing it as problematic in any way is somewhat telling as well.\n\nNow would it have a massive effect on Tesla’s stock price on its own?
