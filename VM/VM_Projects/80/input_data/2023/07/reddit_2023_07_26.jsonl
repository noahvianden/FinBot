Over a decade behind, now realizing that they need an infrastructure for the cars they have to eventually manufacture if they hope to survive.\n\nDifference being that Tesla already owns the EV market, their infrastructure, and will always be able to sell better EVs cheaper and a lot more of them, profitably.", "score": 58, "replies": [{"body": "They either believed, or listened to people who believed, that it really would be simple for legacy automakers to just start making profitable, desirable EVs whenever they were ready to do so and Tesla‚Äôs lead would just evaporate overnight. \n\nIt‚Äôs as if an experienced alpine hiker were to watch some new guy park their car, get their gear on, and start hiking up a mountain. The old hiker could look on at the newcomer and justifiably say that they could obviously do the same thing if they wanted to. After all, they‚Äôve been climbing that mountain every summer for their whole lives! \n\nBut the new hiker isn‚Äôt heading up on a lovely July morning. No, they‚Äôre they‚Äôre heading up the mountain in December and there‚Äôs a winter storm rolling in.  \n\nFortunately for the new hiker they took the time to prepare, they brought proper winter gear, and, most importantly, they have a plan for how they will make it to the summit safely in winter. \n\nThey‚Äôre well on their way when the old summer hiker realizes <for reasons> that they actually have to climb the same mountain, too, and *right now.* But unlike the new hiker, they haven‚Äôt prepared at all and must just throw themselves at the mountain wearing whatever summer hiking accoutrement is rattling around their trunk.\n\nAt first the veteran hiker remains supremely confident because it‚Äôs basically like hiking in summer and they know the mountain. Onlookers aren‚Äôt concerned either because they‚Äôve seen this old guy climb the mountain time and again all summer long, year in and year out. And how much harder could it really be to hike in winter? Same principles apply, right? You just put one foot in front of the other. Sure, they‚Äôll undoubtedly be some hiccups along the way adapting summer hiking experience to winter hiking, but they‚Äôve been hiking for *years!* Look at how nice their hiking shorts are, that light day pack won‚Äôt tire him out, and those old heavy leather boots are perfectly worn-in and have never failed in the past. \n\nIt shouldn‚Äôt come as a surprise that the old hiker rapidly finds themselves in peril as they encounter deep snow, dropping temperatures, and lose all sense of direction when the winter storm hits. It turns out that despite being a half-century member of the alpine club and an experienced mountaineer, they are wholly unprepared for a winter hike that‚Äôs barreling towards becoming a multi-day odyssey if they get snowed in. It turns out this is *nothing like* their usual summer jaunt in the hills. \n\nMeanwhile, the new hiker keeps making steady progress through the blizzard and their single-minded focus on hiking a mountain in winter has let them come prepared for the storm and all the  other uncertainties and setbacks they will undoubtedly encounter.\n\nIt‚Äôs impossible to say how it will all turn out. And, again, most people will be forgiven for assuming the veteran hiker would be fine and could easily summit the mountain in winter if they just put their mind to it. Plus the new hiker is unproven and hasn‚Äôt even climbed *any* mountain before, so why should anyone assume they‚Äôll be able to reach the summit at all, much less ahead of the veteran hiker? But the longer things go on, the more unlikely it seems that the old veteran hiker will make it to the top first, at all, or even survive the attempt. And that new hiker looks smarter and more capable by the hour.", "score": 36, "replies": [{"body": "You forgot to mention that the veteran hiker is 100 years old, has emphysema, and is waiting for a double hip replacement", "score": 10, "replies": []}, {"body": "Chapter 2:", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "I heard that in the audible voice", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "The winter storm is growing even more furious, relentless snowfall and bitter winds that chill to the bone. Visibility is dwindling rapidly and the old hiker is becoming more desperate with each step, his summer gear woefully inadequate for the harsh realities of winter mountaineering. Hypothermia is a serious threat, and he is entirely unprepared for a potential overnight stay on the frostbitten slopes. \n\nIn contrast, the new hiker is persevering. It's not easy - the biting cold seeps into every pore and each step is a struggle against the icy winds and deep snow. But they're prepared for this. They're dressed in a layered ensemble of insulating materials that traps body heat and wards off the cold. Their pack is heavy, filled with food, a stove, a bivy sack, and other gear that is necessary for survival if stranded overnight. They're not just surviving the storm; they're steadily making progress up the slope.\n\nThe old hiker's friends and alpine club members watch the scene unfold from a distance. They'd initially been confident in his abilities, citing his years of mountaineering experience and his intimate knowledge of the mountain. But as the storm worsens and his progress slows, they're starting to worry. Some even openly question why he didn't prepare for the winter ascent, but many just cling to the hope that his experience will see him through. \n\nThe onlookers are also keeping an eye on the new hiker. At first, they'd dismissed them as inexperienced and overly ambitious. But as they watch the new hiker plodding on, making slow but steady progress, their perceptions start to change. The new hiker had a plan, they came prepared, and now they are managing to weather the storm. \n\nIt's clear that the old hiker underestimated the mountain in winter, over-relying on his experience of the summer hikes, and now his lack of preparedness could cost him dearly. Meanwhile, the new hiker, with their careful planning and adaptability, is navigating the same terrain in the face of a blizzard. Their trek might be slower, but it's consistent, and in these conditions, that could make all the difference. \n\nAt this point, it's too soon to tell who will reach the summit first, or if the veteran hiker will survive at all. But one thing is certain, the new hiker, who everyone thought was ill-equipped to handle the mountain, is proving to be a formidable contender. Their persistence in the face of adversity, their preparation, and their determination are starting to make people question their initial assumptions.
