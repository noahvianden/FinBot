Tesla knows how to manufacture cars of the future and make a terrific margin doing it.  \n\nThey are also an AI and Robotics play.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Key word \"could\". The reality is Microsoft doesn't have the ad business and infrastructure to build around ChatGPT and on top of that ChatGPT isn't economically viable. It costs more to query the ChatGPT model than they can make for showing ads along with that query. A massive LLM like that won't be a threat at all to be honest. The unit economics don't make sense and it will take much more powerful semis and/or much cheaper energy to make it work at scale (hence the small roll out to build hype). It will be a cash drain on Microsoft until investors revolt and force them to stop wasting the money on the compute. If it was really such a big threat then OpenAI wouldn't have given half the business way for a meager 10B. A company with its sights set on a multi trillion dollar business (Google) giving up half the business for 10B? Should tell you all you need to know.\n\nTesla could lose their cash cow due to the massive wave of government mandated competition coming. The thing is no one auto company has to outperform Tesla. They can all underperform Tesla and they can all have worse margins than Tesla and they can all collectively still drive massive price competition and destroy Tesla's profit margins. They can literally take zero margin which will put pressure on Tesla. Not to mention there will be massive loads of cash and bailouts available from investors, banks, and governments. Tesla doesn't have a monopoly on EVs like Google does on search. In fact as of Q4 Tesla market share of battery EVs had fallen to just 10% in China and 14% in Europe. I don't buy Tesla as a robotics play. What have they done in robotics? Run someone out on stage in a suit? They buy all their robotics equipment from Kuka and others in their factories.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I thought your Tesla info was bullshit at best and harmful at worst.\n\nAfter reading your chatGPT statements im moving away from bullshit to straight lies.\n\nYou sir, are full of shit", "score": -2, "replies": [{"body": "Ah I see you have nothing of value to add here. Everything I said about ChatGPT was factual. The ChatGPT model is absolutely massive and costs more per query than can be made from ad placement. It's a losing business until compute and energy become cheaper. That's why task specific models fine tuned from smaller LLMs are a much better proposition than a one size fits all LLM in terms of viable businesses. In fact they're used all over the place already. I actually work in ML and can confirm transformer models have been rampant in NLP applications for like 5 years already. OpenAI just made theirs bigger and used  human in the loop reinforcement to make its answers sound more plausible. It still hallucinates and makes things up and is only trained on a pre-2021 corpus. The fact that it's bigger just means it uses more compute and energy, making it economically unviable (today). OpenAI gave up 49% of their business and 75% of all profit until Microsoft recoups their investment in exchange for 10B. Why would anyone agree to that if they were on the verge of upending a multi trillion dollar company. Please feel free to educate yourself and come back with anything useful that may dispute those statements.

It wasn't founded with that in mind.\n\nBut anyway, I'm not saying LLMs aren't the future. They have already been integrated with many products you use today and you don't even realize it. Google has been a leader in their development and has been using them for years already. OpenAI just scaled theirs up to the point where it became entirely uneconomical but interesting in the amount of information it could store and hallucinate. If it becomes economical in the future to query LLMs of that scale then Google can easily scale theirs and match anything OpenAI puts out. OpenAI doesn't have a monopoly on the technology. And like you just pointed out they are all trained on the same corpus (the web). Proprietary datasets will become much more valuable (Qoura, Reddit, etc). I personally believe the winner will be those who do more with less (more efficient and task specific LLMs). At the end of the day these are businesses and they have to make money not burn it. Google's business is not under threat by any means yet. Google is still synonymous with search and it takes a lot to change something like that. A better product doesn't always win out especially when there are social and switching cost factors at play.
