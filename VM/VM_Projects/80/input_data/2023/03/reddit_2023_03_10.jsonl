The $116 billion difference was equivalent to 43% of Bank of America’s $270 billion of total equity, or assets minus liabilities, as of Sept. 30.

Now the loss gets realized when they sell let's say $1T in bonds for $800B (I have no idea what the real ratio would be, this is just a demonstration, but there would be some loss).  So $1T of assets disappears and they only get $800B.  So in this example, every $800B of withdrawals would cause a $200B loss.  How do you cover that loss?
