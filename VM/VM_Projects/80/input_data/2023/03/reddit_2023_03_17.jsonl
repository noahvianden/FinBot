Obviously, that puts the Fed in a very scary place and I honestly don't envy Powell (although I'll argue it's their fault this is happening in the first place!) given that just a week ago he said they need to pick up the pace of rate increases because inflation was persistent.\n\nI am personally smelling an imminent panic (likely leading to further losses), but weirdly enough Michael Burry(out of all people!) was hopeful: [https://twitter.com/BurryArchive/status/1636028550708068353/photo/1](https://twitter.com/BurryArchive/status/1636028550708068353/photo/1).
