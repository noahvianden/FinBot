{"title": "Consensus on PYPL in 2024", "selftext": "All, I would like to hear what people think of PYPL in 2024. There are many reports out there pointing out that PYPL will have a breakthrough or will be trading higher due to oversold and how it's undervalued at the current price. I do agree some extent that it's fairly undervalued based on their business infrastructure, transaction volumes, and brand recognition. Also, I like the facts that new leadership change and he's trying to trim the fat and be more efficient in all business segments. However, At the same time, this stock is probably the most hated stock in fintech and this reflected on the current price. I think this is the only stock that has negative YTD returns in fintech while all of growth stocks have explosive returns in 2023. Based on the technical chart in 3 months frame, it is moving slowly upward but I feel like it doesn't have enough gas to push higher compared to others in fintech such as SQ, SOFI and etc. I was hoping to see a positive upward movement consistently but it seems like everytimes it moves up then it comes down to make it flat or where it was before. I have been holding this stock since 2021 and initially I was thinking to hold it until the end of 2024 to see if it's worth to continue holding it or call it a quit. However, based on what I've seen so far I am starting to have a second thought and perhaps stop wasting time and it's time to finally move on before it's too late. What is your opinion on this stock and what do you believe in general consensus heading 2024?\n\nFull disclosure, I've invested a lot in this stock and my avg is down to around 105ish. I've never expected to see this stock would bounce back up to pandemic level. But I was targeting perhaps 100ish range but given what its doing, this might be a unrealistic dream.
