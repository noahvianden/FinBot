If you look at the Pittsburgh subreddit a lot of actual steel workers are ok with this takeover and probably hate their union leader.

Nippon said Us Steel hq can stay there, they said theyd honor previous union contracts,  and they are a company with a great reputation in the industry.

Now, Democratic Senator John Fetterman of Pennsylvania used a video filmed from his house that was overlooking a U.S. steel plant to call for the sale as bad for workers. Let's listen to that.\n\n\n\n\nMART√çNEZ: Professor, is he right? Will jobs be hurt - U.S. jobs will be hurt by this sale?\n\nPRUSA: So I don't think so. I think he's 100% wrong. So there are challenges for U.S. Steel workers, and those challenges are going to be there at U.S. Steel with or without Nippon Steel's ownership. What's most important for U.S. steel workers, and particularly the ones at U.S. Steel, is that they have companies that will invest and continue to invest in state-of-the-art technology to allow them to be competitive. U.S. Steel's really struggled over the last decade in investments in their firm. They've made a lot of promises that they haven't been able to keep. And I think the hope for the steelworkers is that Nippon will bring much-needed capital into the facilities.\n\nMART√çNEZ: And U.S. Steel, in their announcement, says that Nippon Steel will honor the union's collective bargaining agreement. So we'll see what happens there. Senator Fetterman also went on to talk about national security. He says steel is always about security, both our national security and the economic security of our steel communities. Any concerns with that, professor?\n\nPRUSA: No. For first of all, the national security arguments related to steel are much overblown. I mean, the actual percentage of steel used in the modern military as a percentage of our production is quite low. So that's a traditional argument made for kind of protectionist reasons, it's certainly not valid. And then, if you take it seriously, Japan is one of the United States' closest allies. And Nippon Steel is a world-class company. It actually benefits U.S. national security to have one of the prized companies in our country revitalized with this joint partnership. In a way, what's happening at U.S. Steel right now is what we've seen over the last 20 years with a number of large steel companies, that is a move to become large, global corporations.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Got a doomer in the chat", "score": 0, "replies": []}, {"body": "According to J.D Vance and company, it's a national security issue.
