{"title": "14 Months Wheeling 300k Account - Update", "selftext": "What's up everyone.\n\nThis is the update for November 2023. Octobers update can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/17ma49o/13_month_wheel_update_300k_account/).\n\nIn November 2023 I closed 13 trades with an average hold time of 16 days for a gain of $4,549. Still holding many shares of many companies so I've been limited on the amount of positions I am willing to open, however the positions I'm holding shares in have seen substantial capital gains as this month ripped higher. This is evidenced by the fact that last month I had unrealized **losses** of $19,000 but today I have unrealized **gains** of $3,000.\n\nBelow are the trades I closed in Nov 2023.\n\n[Closed Nov positions](https://preview.redd.it/mt9heezdiq3c1.jpg?width=859&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=735c1d02665d2fe7ddfda7f9d9d9cd4165f3c6a2)\n\nMy total realized profits for the past 14 months is currently $92,818 and my current unrealized profits are $3,000. Again, this is a shift from last month where I was holding unrealized losses instead.\n\n**This brings my NET profit to \\~$96,000. This is a 32% return on a 300k account in 14 months. QQQ is up 29.75% and SPY is up 14.4% in this same time period.**\n\nBelow is a running log of all my trades\n\n[Running log through Dec](https://preview.redd.it/k4hzi33wkq3c1.jpg?width=859&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=87c71e7508c67727638f9555d75aad28ff2ba69f)\n\nNo assignments this month as you can imagine since the market has been on fire. Got called away from my SBUX position which freed up some buying power. Will be called away from my CRWD position next week finally after holding for a year. Will also be called away from ENPH next week for some tax loss harvesting. PSTG is a new stock I just started digging into, first time selling puts on it after their 14% drop post earnings the other day.\n\nHope this helps and thanks for the continued support!\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "188kked", "created_utc": 1701459858.0, "score": 102, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 118, "comments": [{"body": "How were your drawdowns compared to QQQ/SPY over the same period?", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "My biggest drawdown was 8%, spy and qqq experienced 11% and 12% drawdowns during that time respectively.

The difference is I trade strangles rather than CSP's and I'm more conservative with my delta selection and DTE. I found that theta declines fastest in the last week so I have been trading 10 DTE.
