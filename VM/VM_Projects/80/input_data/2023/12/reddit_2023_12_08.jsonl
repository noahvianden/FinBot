{"title": "Amazon drops Venmo as payment option", "selftext": "* Amazon will no longer allow users to pay with Venmo beginning Jan. 10, according to a notice sent to users.\n* The company announced last October it would accept Venmo at checkout.\n* Shares of PayPal, which owns Venmo, slid on Thursday.\n\nAmazon notified users late Wednesday it will soon stop accepting Venmo as a payment method.\n\nThe company said it will no longer let users pay using Venmo beginning Jan. 10, according to a notice sent out to Amazon customers. Amazon will still accept Venmo debit and credit cards, the notice states. Venmo announced the move in a separate notice posted to its website.\n\n“Due to recent changes, Venmo can no longer be added as a payment method,” the company said. “Venmo will remain available to users who currently have it enabled in their Amazon wallet until 01/10/24.”\n\nShares of PayPal, which owns Venmo, closed down 1.7% on Thursday.\n\nThe move is an abrupt reversal. Amazon announced last October it would add Venmo as a payment method at checkout, giving shoppers more options to pay for their purchases. Venmo is a popular payment service that lets users instantly send money to one another.\n\nAn Amazon spokesperson confirmed the change and said shoppers will still be able to use “nearly a dozen other payment methods.” The company didn’t elaborate on why it is removing Venmo as a payment method.\n\nA Venmo spokesperson told CNBC in a statement that the company and Amazon agreed to disable the payment service as an option, adding: “We have a strong relationship with Amazon and look forward to continuing to build on it.“\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/07/paypal-shares-slide-after-amazon-drops-venmo-as-payment-option.html", "id": "18dm4e7", "created_utc": 1702039771.0, "score": 215, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 88, "comments": [{"body": "“due to recent changes” thanks for the thorough explanation of why you’re making the change Amazon!", "score": 226, "replies": [{"body": "Chargebacks perhaps or having a buffer with fraud?
