You aren't going to have a broken arm and say \"No big deal\". \n\n>We also do not know how badly the Corrolla was damaged in the first impact. I assume the Corrola air bags deployed as well.\n\nWe can see the damage of the Corolla. The entire front is destroyed. If the airbags didn't deploy, that would be a huge problem. And the driver would have been clearly hurt. Airbags deploying make more sense. But the driver is also just 17 yrs old. Not likely feeling anything from hitting the airbags right now. But they are likely going to feel it in the future. Nearly everyone does. Not bad though. Unlikely he will go to the hospital. But same for everyone in the CT. \n\n>We also do not know what the side Impact did to the castings\n\nTrue, but very unlikely by the damage seen. \n\n>You also discount time to repair. The CT is not rolling out of the shop anytime  soon. \n\nI didn't even talk about time to repair. Didn't care. Again, repairable vs totaled. \n\n>So factor in car rental.\n\nNot likely since it is a factory vehicle. But would be something to consider if this were a customer vehicle.\n\n>Again what are you considering a win.\n\nRepairable vs totaled. But didn't really say \"win\" as everything is kinda murky. But no real injuries for either party. And even though the CT is very likely repairable, it is at a high cost while the Corolla is totaled simply because it isn't worth much. \n\nBut if you want to really have a win counted, here you go. The CT driver will be on the road again within a few hours or a few days max. Could be another car, could be a rental, or could possibly be the CT itself. The Toyota driver will need to buy a new car. But at 17 yrs old, he likely won't get one quickly. And the insurance may not even pay him since the car is very likely liability only (2009 hand-me-down for a kid). While that is circumstantial, what isn't is that the kid who likely was over paying for insurance will now have a wreck with a very expensive vehicle on his record.

Maybe the same CT, maybe another, maybe a used Tesla, maybe a rental, or even a Corolla. Doesn't matter. The CT driver isn't 17 and didn't cause the wreck.

The police said that he went off the road and over corrected when trying to get back on the road. If there is a correction somewhere, I would like to see that. But as of what the police stated, the Corolla went slightly off-road, corrected too much, and then slammed into the side of the CT. \n\n>Since you like to speculate, I will as well.

And it went enough to massively damage the car. \n\n>I thought cars would bounce off the CT.\n\nThe Corolla did bounce off.
