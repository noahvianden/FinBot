It just can't.\n\nHow do others not realize that that every thing just leads to a V. \n\nYes thing are going well and I agree! Economy is doing well etc. Fed this, Fed that... Again we have never had a market this unstoppable where the market just isn't capable of having the most basic pullback and that needs to be discussed more.
