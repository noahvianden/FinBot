It depends if the fed has to re-raise rates after initially lowering them, though.\n\nIt is common knowledge that the fed starts lowering rates only once they have accomplished their goal of cooling the economy, in which something usually breaks. That's why they raise rates in the first place. To slow the economy.\n\nAgain, it isn't an argument. It is 100% fact.\n\nIt is also why you see a recession after the yield curve uninverts.

Which is why we had crazy inflation, which is why we had to raise rates, etc..\n\nUltimately, I never stated WHY we entered a recession as the WHY doesn't matter.

No, I didn't say that in 2022. \n\nI'm just providing tangible data and facts, which you can ignore if you want, that's entirely up to you.\n\nHowever, what I'm saying is history has shown that 100% of the time the fed has cut rates, we have entered a recession sometime within the next 5 years (the recession takes longer to hit if the fed lowers rates, then has to raise them again).\n\nI never said I could pick the bottom. I never told you to go all cash. I never said a recession was coming in 2023. I said I think a recession is coming solely based upon history. Even so, past performance is not indicative of future results, so we may not enter a recession... But if I were a betting man, I would say that yes, based upon history, I would bet we enter a recession in the near/medium term future.\n\nWith that said, if you also look at the charts, we typically rally hard before falling. Like in 2008 we rallied 15% once the fed announced cuts. Then dropped a little and actually had another 10% rally before finally falling.\n\nMaybe you should stop listening to people on the internet for financial advice and start accepting some responsibility for your decisions instead of blaming other ppl bc of what they told you.
