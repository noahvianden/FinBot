Currency conversion rates will improve margins. The strong dollar had a big negative effect on margins in Q3 but the dollar is weaker in Q4. This is a tailwind.\n\nIn addition to the above, if Tesla's margins are indeed higher on MIC exports than on MIC domestic sales (as i suspect), the increase in exports as a % of total MIC sales will help offset the potentially lower margins in China due to the delivery incentives.\n\nSo, i wouldn't assume margins will necessarily be lower in Q4.\n\nAnd i think profitability will be higher than analyst estimates in 2023, simply because Analysts have consistently underestimated Tesla's EPS for the last 5-10 years. They've always been under. So, i think just on that basis, it's highly likely Tesla beats their estimates.\n\nBut if that's not convincing enough, look at EPS revisions.

MIC cars which are sold in China have a lower sales price and therefore lower Profit Margins than MiC cars which are exported and sold elsewhere.\n\nYou can check this out yourself by looking at the sales price of various countries which receive exports versus the sales price in China.\n\nThey make more profit by exporting a car than selling it domestically.\n\nAs a result, when the export % of MIC cars increases, so do profit margins because those exports will pull the average up.\n\nThat means Tesla can effectively lower profit margins in China but still maintain relatively high margins globally.\n\nFurthermore, global profit margins should actually be higher in Q4 over Q3 (all else being equal) because the USD is weakening relative to the Euro and other global currencies.\n\nThe strong dollar had a big hit on Q3 profits due to currency conversion losses reducing margins. This works in the opposit way too. When the dollar weakens, margins increase.\n\nLastly, it's true there may be a temporary demand problem in China.

These same analysts are predicting 48% CAGR for the next 5 years.\n\nBased on the analyst track record, i imagine Tesla's true 2023 P/E is probably below 30x, and it's EPS CAGR will likely far exceed 48% because of operating leverage. If Tesla grows sales and revenues 50%, their EPS will grow far in excess of 50%.\n\nAnd the table is set for next year.

This is the only thing that matters and you don't even know the answer. It's also important how big the differences are after everything is taking into account. (ie the cost of doing business in a country must be taking into account as well, for the the factory the calculation is different because it's where you make the product, for the companies you sell in, it's a choose to sell your product there or not. There are operational costs that scale in different ways.)\n\nThe discount they give doesn't matter were they give it, if it's where they have the biggest margins one bit. What matters is how much discount to how many cars. If they give the same discount to the highest margin cars or the lowest margin cars is IRRELEVANT. It all gets calculated together in the end. Only thing that counts is total sum earned for total sum expended. Unless the difference between net profit per car on average and the discount is significant (a multiple of 5 is significant) and the resulting shift in where cars are sold is also significant. (like an increase of 25% in the one place vs a 16,67% decrease in another place)\n\nWherever they lower their prices, they will most likely sell more cars, so there will be more cars sold at a lower price. Take your example and say they give discount elsewhere and the mix changes, then you get to the exact same numbers in the end. The only way you don't get the same result is if you drop price and you assume they will sell more cars in the places they didn't drop the price. You would have to be really stupid to do that. Or you guess a number and from there assume the discount they give is 1/5 of the difference in net profit per car and you can increase sales 25% in one region while dropping it 16,67% in the other region.\n\nThe price for the cars isn't the same to make so your hypothetical arithmetics are dumb as fuck.
