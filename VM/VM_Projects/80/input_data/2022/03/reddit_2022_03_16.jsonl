If you decided to skip out on something due to the uncertainty of the future or due to the virus dangers that results in a pent up demand. A lot of those purchases were only delayed, not canceled outright. Even the ones that were canceled outright freed up money that could be spent elsewhere. This increases demand.

Even my brother ended up buying a Tesla only because it was the only thing available. He wanted a Mach-E but the wait is likely over a year. He did order a Lightning in the 2nd wave but he probably wont see that till year end. He is hoping to just sell the Tesla once the truck arrives.\n\nTold him this is a horrible idea and to wait but he has cash to burn so he just went for it since the Tesla was ready now and his car was on its last leg.\n\nI will say however, he is very unhappy with his Model-Y.

Literally there is no point to it at all except maybe self parking for someone who doesnt know how to park a car...\n\nBut worst of all, he had it about 3 weeks when there was some sort of recall and the car has been in the shop for 4 weeks since... its literally been in the shop longer than he had possession and what did they give him as a loaner? A tiny M3... He is not happy at all and they keep pushing back the return date due to supply problems.

Meaning not only do you need to monitor the drive itself, but also monitor the cars behavior. Basically you are like a driving instructor. You know those cars where they have a 2nd brake so they can take control? Thats exactly what this is like. Good luck with inner streets. I dont think you can even turn it on there can you? I didnt try that but I assume it would be nerve wracking. \n\nSelf driving is all or nothing. It either can self drive like a human or it cant. If it cant, you are doing extra work. The only thing that seems worth it is the parking and even that is like pulling teeth. It only parks in reverse and wow is it slow. If you do that at costco on a busy day a lot of people will be very angry assuming they dont take your parking as the idiot car pull forward to backup. But if you suck at parking for whatever reason, then there you go. Ive heard some people cant parallel park. Might also be nice for huge semis and such. Otherwise, worthless. Total waste of time and money.\n\nThe seats suck. He is 6-4 300lb and im 6-0 230lb. We are both ex-athletes, he younger than I am. They suck.
