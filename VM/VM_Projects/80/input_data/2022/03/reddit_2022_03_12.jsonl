There's good reason to believe their growth isn't going to be sustainable in a downturn and it's possible we may even see systemic risks surface. For example the exposure to Cross River Bank is probably a point of systemic failure in this sector, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_River_Bank\n\nEven fintechs with earnings and a reasonable PEs like UPST are probably more risky that they appear on paper.", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "I’ve followed AFRM for a while and will continue to increase my position in the stock, so that said, I want to call out that you have a couple of misunderstandings on this comment and the one below.\n\nThe first is that the delay of the bond sale is an issue. I can’t read the Bloomberg article, but it’s my understanding that the delay was not due to an inability to sell, it was a conscious decision not to sell at a lower rate when they believe they can get better terms once the Russia-Ukraine situation has settled down. They did the same thing around Covid first wave. Given the Affirm business model, they are just more impacted by interest rate hikes.\n\nSecond call out is that CRB doesn’t securitize the loans, they originate them. The bulk of the expenses you see on AFRMs expenses is the origination costs. CRB is also not the underwriter, Affirm is. Sounds trivial, but figure you should know that the bond sale Affirm is doing is the securitization of those loans (basically Affirm is creating a trust, packaging the loans, and selling the debt)\n\nBecause Affirm underwrites, they can control the risk level if the market takes a turn and reduce delinquencies. Their models target for 2%, but have missed a bit in the recent past and their delinquencies average 1%. This means they missed opportunities at making more loans and revenue. \n\nAll this said, my big bet is that Affirm itself will become a bank one day and that will automatically drop their expenses in a big big way (origination costs and funding costs go down, revenue goes up in some states due to being able to charge higher interest rates). They will expand to other countries with Amazon and Shopify given the investments both have made in the company (They gave amazon 7M shares for basically free and an option to buy 15M more shares). At the same time, the sector is expected to continue to grow a lot in the US. \n\nThe major concern is, if they don’t do all that, you make little to no money in the investment. If they do get that right, that means the ad sales on Affirm app become more valuable (because users), they can replace current credit score system (because they do more than just users with credit scores), and they become a Visa type company that is better vertically integrated. \n\nIt’ll probably end up being a waste of my time when I look back at this 10 years from now, but I’m a huge fan at the moment.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": ">Because Affirm underwrites, they can control the risk level if the market takes a turn and reduce delinquencies.

My understanding is that a lot of the loans originated by fintechs are securitised by Cross River Bank.
