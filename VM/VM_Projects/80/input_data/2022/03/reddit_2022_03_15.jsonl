{"title": "Is it worth buying LEAPS with IV at yearly highs?", "selftext": "I'm fairly new to options trading and so far have only felt conformable buying LEAPS which I've done to some success. However, given the current levels of market volatility and the subsequent inflated option premiums, I'm struggling to find any reason to pull the trigger on stocks that I've got high conviction in.\n\nFor example, a huge amount of blue chip companies have a 52 week IV percentile of 95%+. This includes Microsoft 98%, Apple 97%, Google, 95%, Visa 97% and many more. As far as I understand, this means that IV has been higher than current levels only <5% of the time over the past 52 weeks. If I'm understanding this correctly, that must surely mean that now is a god awful time to be buying LEAPS or any similar call-related options strategy. Even a high delta and favourable price movements will struggle to offset such high IV premiums and once volatility starts reverting back to the mean, it will be even harder to profit.\n\nDo you guys agree that buying LEAPS on underlyings with such high IV is a huge no go? Or am I missing something here? What levels would you need to see IV decrease to before you consider buying?", "id": "tf29ig", "created_utc": 1647383477.0, "score": 67, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 86, "comments": [{"body": "I just bought some Facebook LEAPS, but I went deep in the money to reduce that high IV exposure.
