Great little car and didn't have any issues with it.   Was a 3 year lease.   But the main issues were the dealers.   Since I was new to EVs I was hesitant and they sensed that.   So everything was geared to try and get me to buy a gas powered car.     It became clear that they just didn't want to sell an EV which become even clearer after purchase.\n\nBut largely the issue is all the problems you have with gas cars x 10 at dealers for EVs.    In the case of Nissan they said you needed a battery check once a year to maintain warranty and that for the first 3 years that is free.   It became clear the reason for this was to get you back in the dealership to try and upsell you on every service they could.      Since they need limited maintenance dealers know they aren't going to get you coming back over and over with an EV so they would rather you buy a gas car.  If you do buy an EV they will work you over to try and do service you don't really need like a brake fluid flush when the car was only 1 year old.\n\nOnce I bought, and went through the Tesla process, it is hard not to see the problems traditional automotive will have with dealers.   And you can see them trying to deal with that already with the moves made by VW, Ford and GM.     The car itself was fine but just a car.   It didn't feel next gen.    So the Leaf just felt like any other car that happened to be an EV.    A tesla feels like a different thing.   I have described it as the difference between a flip phone and a smart phone.   It just feels new and more advanced.\n\nSo basically traditional auto has all the problems of trying to maintain the legacy when EVs don't actually need that.   The dealer problem is a massive one and not something that is going to be easy to overcome.   And the cars. up until recently from them,  have felt like afterthoughts where they just made a gas car electric.   A great example is the online experience for the leaf.

The car itself we didn't like but the punch of the motor we did.  We lucked out and ended up buying a used low mileage Mercedes Benz B class with a similar Tesla motor and battery set up. They were basically compliance cars.  We enjoyed that car tremendously but it had limited range and no fast charging.  I invested in TSLA at that very moment.  Fast forward to 2021 and we finally bought our first Tesla MYLR and could not be happier.  And yes, TSLA help pay for Tesla.  I still have and keep buying TSLA.  \n\nWe did look at the Mach-e, Ioniq, Bolt and a couple other EVs but hated the dealership experience.  We walked out of the Ford dealership because we could not stand their BS.  Unless you are a masochist, there's no reason to want to waste hours in a dealership as they play their games.  Buying my MYLR online and taking delivery was one of the most painless car buying experiences I have ever had.  I do not see myself ever walking into another dealership ever again.  And yes, I get there are people who will never buy a Tesla, let alone test drive one or get into one.  I have a few friends like that but it's their choice.  I know what my next car will be when it's time to replace my remaining ICE.", "score": 14, "replies": []}, {"body": "I think there‚Äôs two types of people.

With the Ioniq or *any* non-Tesla that same route takes multiple days. I might get there quicker sticking to EA's network which would mean a route going through Chicago, Omaha and SLC before finally hooking north to MT.\n\nMy inability to buy it in MN is just a symptom of the whole problem. Hyundai can't produce enough, so they sell them in limited markets and only get sales from people who just happen to not need to drive in huge CCS dead zones. Lack of availability is the first in a domino effect of compromises and disappointments.\n\nAnd even ignoring charging networks and availability there's nothing about the Ioniq that makes it better than a Tesla in different ways like how Android does some things better than iPhone and vice versa. It's like the Pocket PC of EVs if anything. Hits all the numbers for \"portable computer\" but entirely misses the mark.\n\nTo be truly competitive you have to have it all the same as Tesla and then something that makes it stand out.
