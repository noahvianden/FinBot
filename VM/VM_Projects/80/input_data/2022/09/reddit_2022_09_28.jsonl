{"title": "9-28-22 SPY/ ES Futures, Apple and Tesla Daily Market Analysis", "selftext": "  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hcxt01a8loq91.png?width=505&format=png&auto=webp&s=b86bd9ab890b8f28befdbc4aec5dbdeda4b11175\n\nDo you guys remember back in June and July when inflation was really bad (aka not peaked), the fed was telling us the whole time we are going to continue to raise interest rates and inflation isn’t coming down. And what exactly did the market do? It found the one tiny piece of information that it could that was “bullish” and they went on a 2 month long rally only to it see it come crashing down in epic form… This leaves us exactly where we are today. \n\nSo the question remains and will remain probably until this week closes…. Was today a needed relief rally after the markets saw 6 red days for the first time since the 2020 coivd crash (granted a day late by my expectations) or did we just witness the bottom cemented in and the markets are about to go on another fake “pivot” rally?\n\nFor me on one hand honestly after tapping 360 yesterday and putting the first 6 red days in since 2020 bottom here makes a whole lot of sense, on the other hand there was a lot of oddities about todays rally so lets cover those. First lets talk about TRIN. In general I don’t ever use TRIN to make a trade because to me that’s not the way to use it. In general as you can see a TRIN of 1 is normal. I have never seen a TRIN of 7.48 before. That is one hell of a balance for SPY. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aje958s8loq91.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=d01ad1baf1defccb9ecd664ba49d54fb12315e01\n\nNow why might the TRIN be lagging? Well lets take a look at pre market and the opening hour… \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6xs2ls59loq91.png?width=691&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae030b4f920b9d1c608b78013616832f448da991\n\nNow I have been mentioning this for over a week now but this drop we are experiencing right now is primarily in my opinion drove by non-tech sectors. We have witnessed tech for the most part holding strong despite SPY selling off heavily. What we witnessed today was the exact opposite. Today we saw at open TECH was the sole red in the market. Apple at one point hit -4.5% and Tesla too was very weak. However, despite that the NYSE and the rest of the market was hella green. I have been wondering if we were witnessing a rotation within the markets. I am beginning to wonder if today what we saw was those shorting the NYSE finally took profits. I have been saying that until we see tech breakdown and show true weakness that doesn’t break intraday we wont get the next big leg down on SPY. Now the issue is we just saw that with tech this morning… when the #1 weighted company in SPY is down nearly 4.5% and SPY is up 1% there is something seriously wrong with that picture. \n\nSo the question again remains did we see TECH finally break down today but it was masted by the BOE rate rally or is this about to be a market wide rally. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oik7akq9loq91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=d99c85447aabf12e2748765dc8a872a375b848d9\n\nThere is a lot to unpack here on SPY so lets talk about it. For the last 4 days we have seen 370.6 resistance hold up incredibly well. We had not seen any 15min candles break through or close over that resistance in 4 days… that was until power hour today. Now I have been saying as long as we hold 370.6 resistance I am bearish. Today is even more of a wildcard because we breached that resistance, however, we failed to close over that resistance with a pretty violent EOD sell off. \n\nOn one hand we easily can say that this was a breakthrough resistance and now we should see a continuation up to 380-390… much like the June low where once we broke through this key 370.6 level we never lost it again and from there the bottom was in. \n\nHowever, unlike the June rally we have spent 4 total days closed below 370.6 and unlike June this was not a big dump then V bottom rally. In addition when tomorrows candles open that Daily 8ema is going to put todays candle top wick as a rejection of a potential breakout of the 8ema. Generally a rejection of the daily 8ema means there is more downside to be expected (look at August 25th).\n\nHighlighted on the daily chart is 3 possible scenarios with similar candle structure. Whether this is a true V bottom and its only upside form here now or whether this was merely a much needed dead cat bounce is yet to be seen but as of now we are back to playing level to level till we have a direction. \n\nKey support- 368 -> 364.4 (v-bottom support) -> 362.2 -> 359.7\n\nKey resistance- 370.2 (blue falling wedge resistance) -> 374.25 (373.44 gap fill) -> 375.5 (bear channel resistance ) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/09tnze9aloq91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=9085e696fa1af9306e5a7f8e1866bcb9cafcb09b\n\nFutures also has a potential V bottom setting up thought it is not as well defined due to the fact that overnight futures dropped nearly 1.5% before rallying through the morning on the BOE news. This in a way tells me that the overall sentiment is bearish. Without that BOE news futures were poised to open -1%+ red which with Apple down 4% and Tesla down 2.5% at one point would have led to the 350/3500s almost guarenteed. \n\nFutures continues to also reject the daily 8ema breakout but did take out its falling blue wedge.\n\nKey support- 3710 -> 3670 -> 3635 -> 3600 (blue support) \n\nKey resistance- 3770 -> 3805 -> 3835 (black bear channel resistnace) \n\nIf we happen to breakout and get through 3835 tomorrow that would give me bias that this is a true V bottom and that we are going to see more upside. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xbl4yb2bloq91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=e7a44bf5598e888427e0fd1f3268a08bdcd5fbe9\n\nApple remains intriguing to me. On one hand among spy and overall markets it looked very strong and it looked like there was no way it was going to see that 149.3 support broken. However, we saw a pretty gnarly open and dropped all the way down to smack that 144.8 support line. From there Apple Calls would have been the golden ticket. So the setup we have here on Apple is that we remain in the blue falling wedge, we put in a new low (lowest low since July 14th). So Apple still remains well over the levels in comparison then SPY does. However we broke a 8 trading day long support today. Apple also closed a full candle back below the daily 8ema and has now closed its 5th DOJI in a row. EOD it did attempt to take out that 150.7 resistnace however failed to do that. \n\nKey support- 147.6 -> 144.8\n\nKey resistance- 150.7 -> 152.4 -> 152.8 (blue falling wedge) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ugx206kbloq91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=34976eee5982c5e248571e0dc94ddeec4101b179\n\nLets take a look at Tesla. Tesla had an interesting movement overnight and intraday. Overnight before afterhours closed it was up nearly 2.5%, however by open it was down nearly 2.5%. From there it did see quite the rally through the day. There was a ton of struggle at 283.8 before the EOD spy push green accelerated Tesla through it. However, despite that push green we did not see a close over the daily 8ema and this is actually the 2nd rejection of a daily 8ema breakout in a row. \n\nInterestingly enough this candle close is a bigger bodied dragonfly doji (the opposite of the September 26th candle) and with this I actually expected to see a rejection and downside from here. Much like we saw on August 16th and August 25th. \n\nNot shown or reflected on the daily but Tesla died out right at key weekly resistance of 287.9. We have two potential patterns forming on the daily. We have the black falling wedge and we also have a V bottom forming with the red support line. The thing with the black falling wedge that unless Tesla sees a nice red open under 283.8 then that will be broken. Usually that to me would mean there is more upside to come but with the daily 8ema as resistance I favor downside until Tesla closes over the 8ema. \n\nKey support- 283.8 -> 281.4 (red support) -> 270.2 \n\nKey resistance- 291.8 -> 300\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sri7ys6cloq91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea76e752ca01e631903b5d020811c06bd63456e9\n\nThen there was the VIX. Today we saw the VIX pre market put in the highest high since June 13th. However we saw VIX from there unwind and never stop. The VIX definitely paused at 32 and 31 especially for a long time, however, in the end she unwound and found support at 30. \n\nThis is where things get unpredictable and anyone telling you they know for sure what is going to happen next is lying. With the VIX back to 30 (but over it) and SPY back to key 370.6 resistance we either saw the VIX unwind to prevent full on capitulation with the vix breaching 40-50 so that we can continue downward OR the VIX is confirming with SPY that the bottom is in. \n\nFor me going forward I base a lot of stuff off the weekly close on Friday night. If the futures and SPY weekly candle closes OVER the weekly 200ema and the VIX closes below 28.3 I would think this is a real bottom and not just a dead cat bounce. I would be very interested in some 14 and 30dte calls. I would see SPY retesting 390 and possibly even 400 by end of October. However, if EOW we get a sell off with SPY closing below the weekly 200ema (regardless of where the VIX is) then I would have a really hard time being bullish.\n\nA close over the weekly 200ema then we most likely are looking at a December 2018 weekly 200ema support double bottom… a close below the weekly 200ema and we are looking at a covid March 2020 or August 2011 pause before we sell off even more. Tread lightly here guys.\n\n10% challenge- \n\nToday I had to take off just before power hour so sadly I missed the fun but was able to have a pretty good day still. You guys who know me know that a true trend day like this with extreme momentum is absolutely my least favorite type of days to trade. I treaded very lightly today.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g6ilhk0dloq91.png?width=730&format=png&auto=webp&s=23192a9ca3264ac7ce98bcefc34cd877e12b1c40\n\nI want to remind everyone what happened last time spy was 360-380 and the VIX was over 30… a lot of people blew their accounts up. This is not the time to be playing hot and heavy or full porting (well really no time is the time for that) but this especially is not the time to be doing that… if anything when the VIX breaks 30 we should be leveraging down…\n\nThe VIX being over 30 adds a ton of volatility and unpredictability to the markets. I watched a few plays today that I took, wanted to take and that I saw others take push, reject hard (triggering stops) only to push well through it. I would never recommend removing stops but I would recommend when you enter a play you need to be entering closer to resistance and supports then usual. This needs to be a violent entry without hesitation and it needs to be followed with early profit taking. Don’t let a position that’s green and the price action is pausing sit. Take the proftis and GTFO… 2% win is a hell of a lot better then a -20% stop loss hit.
