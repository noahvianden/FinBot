{"title": "Why CPI will miss using oil prices ( A üåàüêª conformers bias?)", "selftext": "For my fellow bagholding bears who are down 50%+ on their shorts, who held despite being told the CPI will fuck them over. I respect ur conviction as I too share such a conviction. I shall share with you all a glimmer of hope. \n\nThursday when Powell spoke, the market manipulators decided to finally release the estimate of the august CPI after withholding the estimates for so long which led to the market recovering and pumping from Powell‚Äôs impact. This was planned to create a squeeze which as we have seen has killed many of our üåàbrethren. I strongly believe next week we will witness a rug-pull. \n\nI‚Äôm gonna keep this short since I‚Äôm too lazy to attach images and explain them. But I went on the charts and tried to estimate by staring and using volume distribution to guesstimate the average cost of crude for July 22 vs July 21 and august 22 vs august 21. The results are wonderful bear bias and are as follows:\n\nAverage crude oil price \n\nJuly 22- $97\nJuly 21 - $73\n\nAug 22 - $90\nAug 21 - $67\n\nyoy % change/increase\nJuly = 32% \nAugust = 34%\n\nSo I‚Äôm terms of oil price changes from 2022 and 2021 between august and July they are about the same. Meaning if oil was the sole component of CPI we would have 8.4-8.6 and not the estimated 8.1\n\nEven if other shit dropped in price I HIGHLY doubt it will result in a .4% drop YoY. I believe this drop in oil prices is due to some macro seasonal effect cuz in 2021 oil also dropped those months. N=4 aka unreliable but good enough for conformers bias. Isn‚Äôt that what ur here for? So off that the september CPI should come in hot dung October (based off oil prices). Some say car prices this n that dropping but haven‚Äôt they already been dropping?\n\nImo the only reason we saw the drop from 9‚Äôs is because we had oil prices drop July and august which compared to a year priory the oil prices were rising/flat hence a smaller % change but in august 2021 oil prices were dropping so the current oil price decline shouldn‚Äôt be as impactful as a .4% decline to CPI. \n\nTdlr: if we assume oil to be the only contributor of CPI then we should get a hot/flat CPI at about 8.4-8.6 which would cause a dump as it will be well above the fake estimate of 8.1 which was used to pump the market. \n\nNote: core CPI did not drop last month as it is not directly impacted by oil indicating that inflation did not peak last month (correction added as an edit ‚Äî‚Äî core peaked in May) \nEdit 2: core estimate remains at 6.1 compared to last month which was also 6.1 (came in at 5.9 which is same as month before) so at least big money doesn‚Äôt think we‚Äôre ready to turn down further on core despite it being lower than estimates last month. Make of this info what u want but it builds some foundation for the thought which is that core can come in higher indicating inflation did not peak yet\n\n\nEdit 3: July 2021 CPI was 5.4 and august 2021 was 5.3 meaning the reference point for this august is 0.1 higher meaning assuming everything stayed the same between the two months then we‚Äôd have 8.6% YoY. If everything changed equally in terms of relevance between 2021 and 2022 just like oil priced then the CPI will come at 8.6/8.7%\n\nEdit 4: also looking at he overall 2021 CPI data the cpi dropped sharply in July and august then spiked in September aka these are deflationary months for whatever reason. Maybe spending is slowing idk if it‚Äôs seasonal I‚Äôm too lazy to pick up and check past 10 years but one this is for sure. 1. We have a lower reference point 2. We have similar price changes to July meaning inflation will not be that much lower if even lower compared to last year.\n\nAlso obv I lack lots of data and these are all rough estimates. \n\nEvery time now that I posted a bearish DD the market recovered and pumped like crazy and I was always wrong so u can inverse me based off my track record or pray that I am correct this time if ur a üåàüêª. I‚Äôve also been right in the past with forecasts but the market reacted opposite of what I anticipated so I‚Äôm really good at being wrong even when I‚Äôm right. I‚Äôm not guru, this is not financial advice, I‚Äôm on the last of my savings here, I am also jobless.\n\n\nEdit 5: I think if he‚Äôs invoking volker we‚Äôre likley to see more than 1bps or more soon. CPI is YOY so rn we‚Äôre hiking rates and running QT so deflating aka if relative to 2021 the 2022 average CPI is 10% cuz prices rose 10% then if prices rise 2% in 2023 it‚Äôll seem like inflation has been defeated but reality is we‚Äôre actually 12% from 2021 before hyperinflation started. And in 2021 inflation was running abt 5-7% hence real inflation even with the bullshit formula would be around 15% compared to pre pandemic. Inflation much like stocks compounds. Right now with high numbers he had the ability to throw blame on the numbers and hike crazy. Once next year starts he won‚Äôt have such liberty. Inflation won‚Äôt go down until rates are higher than CPI so we‚Äôd need like 10%  rate at minimum and asap as Powell said himself before the consumer starts pricing it in to everyday life cuz that‚Äôs how the inflation spiral happens. He‚Äôs more than likley to wait post election to drop the big bomb of a hike.
