Even SPX is just a simple formula, calculated as the value of a portfolio of market cap-weighted stocks, which is very easy to statically hedge hence why there are so many liquid tradeable products that track it perfectly. VIX on the other hand is actually the square root of the value of a portfolio of strike-weighted call and put options (see variance swap pricing), so it can't be statically hedged and there are no tradeable products that track it perfectly.\n\nAnyway, the output of a formula is only as good as its inputs. I've seen these blips happen before in the intraday VIX charts and they always coincide with times when volatility blows up and market makers pull out their quotes and replace them with super wide bid ask spreads until things settle down. I bet you that CBOE doesn't do a very good job of filtering out the noise from these quotes and merely inputs the average of the best bid and ask of each option into their formula. Market makers will usually blow out their bid ask spreads symmetrically when they try to reduce their risk, but sometimes that results in someone else's one-sided order becoming either the best bid or the best ask for the option so its mid price becomes garbage. CBOE probably has some validation that halts formula output from being published when the output blows up some stupid amount and they'll only let it resume publishing after a human takes a look and signs off on it, at which point it returns to a more reasonable value.", "score": 732, "replies": [{"body": "This guy stocks…", "score": 170, "replies": [{"body": "this guy stonks", "score": 17, "replies": [{"body": "Check out the stonks on this guy.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Thanks for sharing your knowledge", "score": 52, "replies": []}, {"body": "I upvoted you to pretend I understand anything you said.
