{"title": "Weekly forecast/outlook:", "selftext": "I hope you like this brief my fellow enthusiasts.\n\nReports: Let's quickly take a look at some of the more important reports which we will receive this week\n\nPMI Reports: We get a whole host of PMI reports this week, from both the EU and the US. For those who don't know, the PMI is an index which is based on surveys of purchasing managers at companies. This is used to get an indication of the overall health of the manufacturing sector as a whole. This will also paint a picture of the demand, as manufacturing output is based on demand. So this is another metric feeding into inflation related data. I would want this to come in slightly lower than the previous month, to get a nice steady relief in demand and manufacturing.\n\nTrade Balance: We get the US trade balance this week. Which is simply a report outlining the difference between exports and imports within a country (We also get those two numbers for China in separate reports this week). Trade balance is important as it paints a picture of a country output vs input, which shows how much production there is of products, versus demand for international products. This is yet another metric feeding into inflation, not as straight forward as the PMI, but important none the less.\n\nChinese inflation reports: We get both the Chinese CPI and PPI this week. The CPI is an inflation report for consumer products, and the PPI is an inflation report for producers. These will both paint a picture of the inflation situation in China. This once could get interesting as demand has tumbled in China, and with lockdown fears, and interest rate decreases. This report could really swing either way. It will of course be important as China is a huge player economically, so keep an eye out for this one.\n\nOil: Going into this trading week, we have also had some developments in the world of oil.\n\nNord Stream Shutdown: As some of you know, Russia would stop exporting oil through the nord stream due to a supposed gas leak at one of Gazprom's' facilities. This has caused yet another supply cut, and we are starting to see the repercussions, with the EU now having meetings regarding this escalating situation, and oil prices going up once again.\n\nOPEC+ Output Scares: There are fears that OPEC+ (Group of countries whom supply oil) might cut it's output of oil to other countries in 2023. If the Russian situation isn't resolved by then, this could send European energy prices into the stratosphere. Keep a close eye on this situation to see how it develops. (I will also report on it).", "id": "x6g16k", "created_utc": 1662383936.0, "score": 169, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 81, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | |[DGEN\\FRENDS](https://twitter.com/dgenfrends)|\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|2|**First Seen In WSB**|2 months ago\n**Total Comments**|74|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|3 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=x6g16k)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=x6g16k)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Nord Stream is a gas pipeline not oil pipeline.", "score": 31, "replies": [{"body": "Accuracy is rarely a component of WSB DD.
