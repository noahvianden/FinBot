America is sitting at around 134% which means paying off the debt is not possible. Raising gdp growth rate to allow the gdp to catch up is based on production and services and since it's a physical output, it can't be synthetic so it's limited on its increase. This leaves debt and since paying it off is not possible the only remaining play is dilution of currency which causes inflation. Stocks and asset values are not derived from the value of the dollar so usually inflation causes bubbles in markets since its not the value of the assets themselves that are being diluted. This causing a lag before a burst of the bubbles since eventually high, prolonged periods of inflation will eventually affect profit margins and available cash flows of both individuals and companies where they will have less available funds to continue to prop up asset prices and we get a crash in the market. \n\nNot only is the lag catching up but with rising interest rates causes fewer loans to be created and more debts to be payed off, it causes liquidity in the markets to be retracted and less money supply is created which causes more liquidity shocks. \n\nWe probably won't see a bottom until the feds pivot or we see massive liquidity fear shock where banks don't have the reserved cash and the yield on investments aren't high enough to pay out the lenders trying to get there money out.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for the details comments.
