{"title": "Bull case vs Bear case", "selftext": "I wanted to create a list of all the current Bull vs Bear conditions in the current market, and figured I would post it here so people could add in suggestions:\n\n**Bull Case**\n\n* A good amount of damage has been done in markets this year, bringing things down to fair/under valued (based on TTM and Forward EPS estimates).\n* Commodities look to have peaked, along with interest rate expectations, thereby signaling peak inflation (which is what started this whole thing).\n* The job market is still strong, unemployment is low and there's still something like 1.9 open jobs for every person.\n* The consumer is still strong and spending a lot of money. Their balance sheet is also healthy.\n* No recession this year. A slowdown in growth appears certain, but not a recession. Given the recent decline, the market has more or less priced in the current situation.\n\n**Bear Case**\n\n* While there has been a good amount of damage done, markets are only \"fairly valued\" on forward EPS estimates that have not been revised down. \n* Commodities are still higher than pre-covid levels by a significant amount. Peak inflation doesn't mean we instantly go back to 2%. Inflation is sticky, and higher than 2% will have the Fed continue to raise rates. Inflation may slow to 4 or 5% which is still way too high. If they raise and pause rates like the 1970's bear market, it will be a volatile mess.\n* Jobs are a lagging indicator, and things can change quickly.\n* A strong consumer contributes to inflation, forcing the Fed to continue rate hikes until inflation is below 3% at the very least.\n* Until we know what earnings look like, we can't estimate how deep the growth decline will be. It's safer to wait until earnings + forward guidance at the very least.", "id": "w1koet", "created_utc": 1658100849.0, "score": 73, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 86, "comments": [{"body": "Bull case: most of Reddit is bearish.", "score": 118, "replies": [{"body": "Literally the best indicator.", "score": 33, "replies": [{"body": "I disagree.

Or they have better offers. \n\nOne example is a lot plans were put on hold and all the sudden there‚Äôs a huge demand for construction projects. Now contractors are hard to find and charge more. They start hiring workers at much higher rates than they would get at the 7-11 and now 7-11 starts complaining that no one wants to work for them.

Three straight days.\n\nAmerican took the opportunity to offer early retirement packages to a lot of employees across the company during COVID. Note that American is a union company. So if things get a bit crazy they can‚Äôt just ask people to work longer. They are required to stop. That‚Äôs pilots, cabin crew, as well as ground crew. So what happens when you just gave early retirement to a ton of your ground crew and you schedule a bunch of flights when demand picks up when COVID slows down?
