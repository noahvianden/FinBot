Nvidia designs chips for  GPUs and for AI applications. They recently entered the data center market. Nvidia doesn’t make their own chips, but have a contract with TSMC to make chips for them. \n\nIntel designs and makes chips for clients (laptops and desktops), data centers and recently entered the discrete GPU market. They are also expanding into the foundry business, meaning they will make chips for other customers. They also own Mobileye, which is expected to IPO this year or next. \n\nBefore you buy either of the two stocks, I would advise that you learn more about the companies, and their financial performance. Intel for example, has been a dividend stock for a while, but they are going to have a negative cash flow for the first time in decades to fund their foundry business. As a result, the stock may not do well for the next couple of years till Wall Street sees tangible results.\n\nNvidia on the other hand has been growing very quickly the last couple of years, but there are strong signs that the music is about to stop with an oversupply of GPUs and chips in general. The problem with growth stocks is that the multiple completely collapses once the growth slows down, so there is a significant risk of that in the short to medium term.", "score": 86, "replies": [{"body": "It's worth mentioning that Intel has plenty of cash available to afford the foundry expansion for the upcoming years without hurting shareholders . Also, the chip-act gives Intel a pretty substantial subsidy to expand, so it's not all out of pocket. \n\nNvidia really is, and will be for a while, the mayor player in GPU and AI technologies. However, their demand has decreased lately, not in small part due to the crypto-hype dying down. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy pick would be Intel as a long-term value pick. based on Cashflow alone, they are a good deal right now.  not even taking into account the possibility for a turnaround", "score": 37, "replies": [{"body": "Intel’s cashflow is expected to be breakeven or negative.

Nvidia has been extremely tone-deaf to consumers recently, prices and power draw have been increasing at insane rates for major performance gains despite customers asking for more efficient and cheaper cards that only get slight performance gains. They also recently released a GPU that's more expensive than their own GPU which has been out for years now that was faster. Would of been ok a few months ago when prices were insane but they released it just a few weeks ago when it's price-performance made 0 sense. Both companies have the potential to be great but at least in the consumer market Intel is the only one innovating right now at least compared to Nvidia.\n\nWith Intel being the one innovating, has the dividend, longer experience in the field, often considered higher skilled engineers, and recent expansions. Intel seems like it's the better long term option, especially if you compound the dividends, Nvidia may get some good growth in the next few years especially with their new GPUs in a few months hopefully. Current leaks for pricing are ridiculously high so unless they drop the price (which they probably will) they won't sell. But if they're reasonably priced it will be great for Nvidia if their performance leaks are semi-accurate. Intel on the other hand has room to grow for years with no sign of slowing with recent innovations and strong competition with AMD. Their entrance into the GPU market with some driver work (which is likely) may also be extremely profitable in a generation or two. Intel is in a good spot to shoot ahead, with the dividends they're an extremely good long-term hold.
