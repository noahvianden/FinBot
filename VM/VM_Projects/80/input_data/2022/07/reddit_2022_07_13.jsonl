{"title": "7-13-22 SPY/ ES daily TA", "selftext": "Well I have never been so right but felt so wrong at the same time. The play 100% was overnight spy puts. Those of you who listened and played 0dte spy puts saw around 100% gains at open. The only issue is that if you didn’t close those immediately almost half of your gains were gone in the first 5 minutes and the rest were gone by the first closed 15min candle. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sjstray5geb91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=ecf612a3749bf7c7f9461113a93c70d63c759627\n\nThis was quite the wild day today. They literally ran here all day long. This morning we started out with the narrative that “inflation has peaked… its all good… no worries here!”\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0rtuvvh6geb91.png?width=806&format=png&auto=webp&s=a478541480df4d5bf3b2a53d0b3f13ab2c33e250\n\nThe algos had really no bad news to pick up on all day today. Everything was nothing but how CPI is backwards looking and that everythings gonna be just fine. No one I mean no one was forward looking to FOMC and what things could mean… \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ni208h87geb91.png?width=819&format=png&auto=webp&s=065383c13561544a2fab0b9b45b47d7e65071ca7\n\nQue the end of day… and what do we get? We get massive news about 100 basis point hikes and those are 100% not priced in right now. This feels just like right before the FOMC in June where they kept it all good everythings great then all of a sudden WSJ drops a news article about 75bps hikes and the next two days were blood baths.   \n \n\nIf you want my actual opinion.. and this is not TA based by strictly opinion… someone high up purposefully leaked that 10.2 CPI fake article yesterday. What it did was triggerd ALL the algos out there to dump. And it did that day. And then it came out it was fake. But you know what? Those algos now see that we have 9.1% inflation (worst in decades!) but it reads it as less then the 10.2 so the reaction is not nearly as bad. This in my opinion was MASSIVE psyops being played out on algos and retail… Its just like the WSJ article for 75bps hikes… they never release things like that but it was ironically released just in time to let the markets know to price it in before FOMC…. Okay rant over back to TA!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p2f88708geb91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=68d982323bcb770e719f3b6ed1faf540db38d9d5\n\nOkay today we are going to take about the VIX first cause this things truly pissing me off. I can not still fathom how underwhelming the vix reaction was today to CPI. The average move has been about 13% by the vix from low to peak and today we barely saw 10.8%. The VIX is not reacting normally at all and I believe this is what is propping markets up right now. The volatility is not there at all. Until the VIX kicks in a move there is no long positions worth playing at all. \n\nJanuary 12th- vix moved 7.6% total, February 10th- vix moved 22.8% total, March 10th- vix moved 12.6% total , April 12th- vix moved 13.9% , May 11th- vix moved 12% , June 10th- Vix moved 12.7%, July 13th- vix moved 10.8% total… very underwhelming… VIX didn’t even break 30 today…  \n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/px2z66n8geb91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=26ea644d1740d74daed8ef4ae306448da8c6951a\n\nThe Daily chart is starting to form some obvious trends the only issue is its hard to trust… you can see we have a nice inverse head and shoulders forming that should take us to 370 minimum and possible 365 at the lows. However, after todays bullshit its hard to trust and be able to go long for this. \n\nTodays open and close did show us a few things though. We rejected the daily 8ema again (bearish), we closed under yesterdays low (bearish), we gapped filled (neutral) and we bounced off 375 (bullish). \n\nRight now I am seeing 375 as support and 382 as resistance. Until one of these two levels are broken we aren’t gonna see the big move. \n\nBull case- 375 was higher low bottom today and we will break out back above 380 tomorrow and close over the daily 8ema breaking the red dotted resistance line and look for 400+ by end of month. For this case to play out markets have to price in 100bps hike over night (or have done it EOD today), fomc has to be beautifully executed and earnings have to be positive af… if we get all that there is a case to be made that bottom is in.\n\nBear case- today was the worlds biggest bull trap. There is historical accuracy that spy is one day late to react. Today I think is that day. Bears already blased through the black dotted support line and closed under it we will now be looking to complete the inverse head and shoulder and close closer to 370 EOD tomorrow and look for 365 EOD Friday. This would complete the inverse head and shoulders. From here this would be the 2nd test of the weekly 200ema at 363 and could finally break us through it. \n\nNeutral case- we are going to fuck around and find out what JPOW wants to say and do end of July at FOMC. We are stuck in this purple 370 to 390 sideways channel. This is where we are going to maintain for quite a while until we get some sort of amazingly bearish or terribly bearish catalyst. \n\n10% challenge-\n\nWeird day today… so I alerted yesterday that overnight puts were the play… I, however, decided it wasn’t worth gambling 30 and 50% profits overnight on a 50/50 win. I didn’t carry anything but my UVXY calls over night… they opened around 40% but when I saw VIX wasn’t gonna get on board yet again I closed them from 27.8%. Which is sad cause that is about what I should have closed them for yesterday before market closed…. In general I think next Cpi 2 days before playing 7dte ATM uvxy calls would still be the play assuming vix is near 25 again.\n\nFrom there I played the probability and got burnt… I watch the IV probable highs and lows and its resistance/ support that I rarely see broken. I did not anticipate that we had the strength to break through it and knowing that almost every CPI had closed lower than it opened I played some puts on the 10am rejection there and saw a quick 20% only to get absolutely wacked faster than I could get out of them. I attempted to average down once at 1115 when it looked like we topped and got wrecked. Overall I closed them for a pretty massive loss at 145pm only for it to dump next candle. That dump woulda saved me 20% loss. But I don’t know if I woulda closed either… \n\nI was patient EOD waiting for the sell off and scalped a nice full remaining BP 50% 0dte put scalp. Woulda been 150% had I held but wasn’t worth the risk.. I set a 50% stop limit when I saw 60% profits and wasn’t gonna gamble… it didn’t give me a green day… but it did give me a green week still. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2gsubti9geb91.png?width=650&format=png&auto=webp&s=a91543bddfa0b0d4683aa48f680515734d7fcd51\n\nOvernight I am holding these… I am going with the bull trap narrative and that the next 100 bps is gonna get priced in today and tomorrow. \n\nMy break even is 371.75 (-1.8%) for tomorrow and 366.5 for Friday (-3.6% ) from todays closed… I think we get that 370 test tomorrow and that its worth the risk.. if the VIX ever gets back on board this should also get a nice IV pump on a bigger drop too. (see below) but 5 out of 6 post CPI days have also been red with 4 of those being significantly red (with the average being -2%). However, I did not recommend NEW overnight puts as almost all of those days as you can see below did not open with any significant pre market drop. \n\nBiggest lesson today for me was you may be right but your timing may be wrong. In the end being patient and waiting for my play instead of anticipating the play is always best. Had I waited at 10am for a confirmed breakdown in theory there should have been enough left for plenty of gains. However, that doji at 1015am was highly unexpected and did come out of nowhere and all things pointed to heavy bear at the time. In the end the less here is that we CAN NOT ever make a trade that will blow our accounts up. One single trade should NEVER be enough to end your trading career. If it is you went to heavy. I recommend 5-10% per trade. That means that if you have 10k in your options account (again not full net worth) that you only trade $500-$1000/ position.
