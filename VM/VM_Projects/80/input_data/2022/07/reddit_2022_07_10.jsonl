If you buy both types you’re spreading your risk.\n\nIf you want you can choose to buy more growth or more dividend (value) companies.\n\nVOOV are all the more value oriented companies of the the S&P 500.\n\nVOOG are all the more growth oriented companies of the S&P 500.\n\nGenerally speaking VOO = VOOV + VOOG, so you can choose to invest in different types of companies of an index by buying more or less VOOG or VOOV.\n\nThere are some funds that aren’t true indexes, but are groups of high dividend companies. The most popular is SCHD. \n\nTo be honest SCHD is a safer investment. It will not decrease in value as much in bad times (just compare it to VOO for this past year, which was a bad year).\n\nThe price of SCHD decreased by 4.6% and the price of VOO decreased 10.7%. \n\nVOO is getting a 1.6% annual dividend and SCHD is getting a 3.3% dividend.\n\nThe difference is in good years VOO gains much more price value. This makes SCHD valuable for middle age investors approaching retirement that want risk in equities, but slightly less volatility. \n\nThis makes VOO more volatile. You don’t want to sell it during bad years, but you do better if you can wait and sell it after a few good years. VOOG is even more volatile. It is down 15% this year, but in prior years it had increased in price value much more.\n\nWhat I would recommend you doing is considering when you need your money. Do you think you’ll need to use this in a few years? Perhaps for college. You’ll want to choose more stable stocks and SCHD or VOOV might be slightly more stable. You give up some gains in good years for less volatility (In case you need to sell in bad years) and you get a extra small dividend every year in addition.\n\nIf you’re fine leaving invested for many years and you don’t need immediate access to the money, choose something a bit more aggressive toward growth.\n\nVOOG are all the more growth oriented (and likely low dividend)companies of the S&P 500.\n\n\nSo you can still choose to by an index tilted in different directions.\n\nSo what is right for you? That all depends on the risk you want to take to get larger returns. If you need your money at any given moment, choose less volatile.

My understanding is that operating leverage basically arises from OpEx growing more slowly than revenue and NOT gross margins increasing.  If that’s correct then:\n\n1. Why are you discussing lower service costs if warranty reserves are already accounted for in gross margin? Tesla will have > 80% of their entire fleet under warranty for as long as they grow > 50% annually.  The important factors would be vehicles shipped per delivery center, how much savings can arise from reducing costs unrelated to COGS.\n\n2. Why factory automation and CapEx?  CapEx is depreciated or amortized into COGS and only affects gross margins. Unless you’re claiming that better factory automation lowers non production expenses like HR?\n\n3. Why insurance?  The only way a new business can improve operating leverage is if it has a superior ratio to the existing business.  Did you calculate that the OpEx / Revenue ratio of the insurance business is < 9%, and thus will help improve the overall company’s ratio?\n\nWithout thinking about it too much, intuitively it seems like operating leverage decreases in importance as OpEx shrinks.\n\nE.g. when OpEx was at 33%, it was far easier to see operating leverage on declines, than it will be with OpEx at 9%.  When that ratio was 33%, reducing OpEx by 10%, used to cause 3.3% of their revenue to fall directly to net profits.  Now a 10% decrease in OpEx only causes 0.9% of revenue to add to the bottom line.  I was hoping to see you cover this factor to project how long Operating Leverage will be a large factor.  \n\nThanks for your wonderful write up and thanks in advance if you choose to answer these questions.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "1.

D&A is a pretty major line item running through the P&L\n\n3. The point was to show that many of Tesla’s R&D projects don’t require much incremental capital. Tesla is will positioned to enter adjacent markets (like insurance) without the upfront capital needed by other players because of the vertical integration and overlap with the auto business.

If they’re means of liquidating assets for cash (since the assumption is that they don’t have much freestanding cash on hand), they will continuously generate less and less profit as the market falls.
