Try like 10-12x. Because people on here only know hyper growth and tech earnings they seem to think that’s a steal when in reality semi’s is closer to a cyclical infrastructure sector. Massive CapEx takes years to materialize (amd’s ryzen success now is result of cash flows dr su was pumping out the door in 2013-2016) and the cash cow order cycles (enterprise) are done on multi year contract refreshes. \n\n23x is a stretched p/e in semis. The key statement here is: The risk/reward is asymmetric. \n\nAMD is not likely to improve their gpu market share (in fact very possible they lose share to intel arc), they’re entirely dependent on tsm fab supremacy which carries its own additional risk as being highlighted in recent national security conversations. \n\nEven with as recent of a launch as the 5800X3D in the consumer space they’ve returned to the “cheaper but 2nd best performing” chip in the segment. \n\nEnterprise is their beacon of light. The problem comes from how much of the low hanging fruit is already taken. The longer they give Intel to respond, the less aggregate market share they will stabilize at. Time is not on their side but enterprise silicon cycles are not nimble.\n\nMacro factors are adverse as well. Rising interest rates naturally put significant pressure on valuations dependent 4-5 years out. At current growth rate guidance (assuming no further degradation or slowdown) AMD wouldn’t *match* Intel’s total revenue today until 2027. The dcf valuation presents a tail heavy cash flow series that leads to high sensitivity to rfr and terminal period.\n\nRight now the fanfare has priced them to execute on all these growth hopes while mitigating all these risks with very little discount rate. That presents marginal upside if they do everything perfectly and very large downside if they don’t….\n\nA good company with likely a good future does NOT mean it’s at a good price. To drive the point home, Intel was poised to be the bedrock of the internet and electronic device driven future in 2000. Over 15 years, they executed to perfection increasing revenue 80x, avging 25% RoE (never less than +11%), and capturing 99/97% market share by 2015.

A fuck up on a single cycle of architecture puts them at a disadvantage for a full 2-4 years.
