Netflix isn't Ford.\n\nThe ONLY challenge any streaming service has is subscribers.  That's it.  Nothing else matters.  Subscribers are EVERYTHING for a streaming service.  Every other metric they can tailor however the heck they want.  And the only thing they can do wrong is something that will tank subscriber count.  So far, ever since 2013, Netflix has had a steady rise of subscribers.  The rate has been increasing, nearly linear, and largely unaffected by most everything else going on, including rate changes(which they do all the time), password sharing changes (has happened more than once already), whatever crap shows or cancelations that people want to complain about, and even new entries into the market space.  None of it has actually mattered because subscribers keep going up along a largely flat curve, regardless of all this stuff.\n\nOnly one other streaming service on the market is growing faster than Netflix, and that's Disney+.  That's it.  Otherwise Netflix has had the most total subscribers by a large margin and a stronger growth slope than everything else.\n\nSo where are they not a growth company and stock?\n\nRevenue has grown steadily and has not flatlined or tapered off.\n\nSo why again is not a growth company?\n\nOk, do we look at PE then?  Well, that's kind of crap because it's never really been an uptrend.  It's been a downward slope the whole time.  So PE has been some of the best it's ever been and has averaged higher than its current value for a long time.  Even the PE at the down turn was the lowest it's ever been, so it had already been the best price to earnings ratio ever before it tanked.\n\nMaybe it's earnings?\n\nThis looks to be the only case where lower earnings were met with a stock price downturn.  BUT, a rise back up did not.  Again, revenue is just rolling in, and all it is just choices in where those dollars are going to various projects.  For some reason, it seems people are freaking out about them actually spending some cash on project.  But even that's incorrect.  October of 2021 before the stock crashed, earnings was 3.2 million.  Great!  Among the best it's had ever.  Then the stock crashed.  O...kay...  The following earnings was 1.3 million for end of Dec.  But that wasn't outside of normal ranges for many previous quarters.  Sure crash the stock, whatever.  Now comes Q1 of 2022 earnings and, bam 3.5 million again, near record levels.  Yay!  Right?  No, the stock crashed again.  Why?\n\nLike there are zero metrics here that show why the stock is tanking.  Great subscribes, dominating the market, great revenue, great PE, everything.
