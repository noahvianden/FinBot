The price of the put ($29) suggests that the market doesn't factor that big a drop. So clearly, **you believe that there is a** **higher than normal probability of a big directional move to the downside**.\n\nConsidering the bolded part as the basis of your trade, selling a put isn't the right trade for that, specially a put such as that. Think about it. A short put is a bullish/non-bearish/range-bound trade. So why would you sell a put if \"bolded part\". If anything, a call credit spread or a put debit spread would have been the more viable trade than what you selected on the basis of your trade.\n\n---\n\n**Selling extremely far off puts has it's own consequences also.** Your win-rate increases, yes. But what also increases is the number of recovery-trades required in-case you DO go wrong. Because with penny options, you lose a larger % of your initial credit on tail events. **Even if there happens to be a tail event, you'd be better off losing a higher dollar amount on that trade (by selecting strike with higher D) because you make way higher dollar amounts on trades that you don't lose.** This is where that whole penny steamroller analogy comes in.\n\nRemember, tail events are tail events. You don't know if it's 2SD or 10SD. If you sold 16D puts, then maybe you get messed up by 2 tail events in a year. If you sold 5D puts, maybe you get messed up by 1 tail event every year. But in the former, you make back the money in 6 months. In the latter, maybe it takes the whole year to make back the money lost.
