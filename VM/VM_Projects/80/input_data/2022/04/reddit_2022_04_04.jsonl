{"title": "Elon Musk Says Tesla Aiming At 30% Gross Margin For Supercharger Network", "selftext": "CEO **Elon Musk** said on Sunday that the electric vehicle maker is aiming at a 30% gross margin or about 10% profitability including all costs for its **Supercharger** network business.\n\n**What Happened:** Investor Ross Gerber had asked Musk if Tesla works on “a 50% gross margin on the energy cost,” and “if it is across the network or it varies by location?”\n\n**Why It Matters:** Tesla reported overall automotive gross margins of 27% last year and 21% in 2020. The EV maker does not reveal a unit-wise margin breakup.\n\nTesla owns and operates over 30,000 Superchargers in over 2,564 locations globally, of this over 8,000 Superchargers are in China alone.
