Which doesn't mean I think that all those comments on reddit are coming from paid trolls, I also think that Musk is very easy to criticize on a lot of things. I'd just guess that there's some conservative think tank out there coming up with anti-Musk talking points, and they're extremely happy to see those taking points getting repeated \"organically\" on reddit and Twitter.\n\nThere's also a lot of investors who bet against Tesla and lost a ton of money and are just bitter. And there's a lot of experts (and arm chair experts) who know how the auto business or aerospace business is *supposed* to work and are bitter that all their predictions from the last 10 years are ending up looking ridiculous.\n\nMusk is turning a lot of things upside down that were supposed to be stable and predictable.

The thing that frustrates me is the amount of misinformed people that think Elon came from extreme wealth and apartheid money, and that he had everything for himself.\n\nThis is wrong and misunderstood. By in large, Elon is a self made man, he had over 100K in student debt when studying, and he was dirt broke when he first came to Canada. Now that Elon's wealthy these past few years, people automatically think he is so evil, and that he gets everything from the back of his workers. \n\nThe overall sentiment I've seen is that most of these thoughts come from the left. Now I myself lean towards the left to many cases, but rationally speaking, a lot of the right that has common sense, does not think Elon is a bad person and he was born with a golden spoon or some BS. By in large, Elon is a person who did build himself up from basically nothing, and somehow, no one on the left seems to believe that.\n\nThe thing is that, Twitter, in itself these days is silencing a lot of the people who do understand Elon correctly. I like the view that Elon has, in that if you can see stuff on a platform to which you don't agree with, that means the platform endows free speech. I'm sure twitter under Elon will still condemn things like the insurrection and all that, because most of the people on both the left and the right side ended up thinking that was unacceptable, except for a few right-wing radicals.\n\nI think Elon has great potential and a great company to add to the portfolio by buying twitter, and maybe just maybe, he will over time push down the amount to people hating him in some regard, by proving to their rationale that his actions are level-headed and fair.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Engaging in a Twitter fight with Bernie is what flamed this up much more then usual (IMHO).

You don't need a Bloomberg terminal to do this analysis though, I realized there are many problems with using this as an indication.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[30 Year Yields Compared to SPX](https://preview.redd.it/x7ljsn94mxt81.png?width=1474&format=png&auto=webp&s=53cbd12a0211926027298578d34e6cac326244d7)\n\nLast week I said that the 30-year yields are better at predicting a market top.  Then I noticed, that both have margins of error, so finding the average of the 30Y + 10Y would be an even better indicator.  Also as the bond yields approach 0 they will decrease slower.  This is slightly an exponential trend, not a linear trend which can be fixed by graphing it logarithmically.\n\n \n\n[Average of 10 Year and 30 Year Yields](https://preview.redd.it/xb0ov8ljyxt81.png?width=1477&format=png&auto=webp&s=d926fc6f86b3307182dd4f7c63aa3e3eba866aa6)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Average of 10 Year and 30 Year Yields](https://preview.redd.it/zhuo5860zxt81.png?width=1480&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce7589143354bba01f71f05994a304f552c41a82)\n\nAs a continuation of the current uptrend in bond yields, I would expect the yields to cross this major level around the middle of June.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Average of 10 Year and 30 Year Yields](https://preview.redd.it/lsbab1e71yt81.png?width=1478&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a6fbe97a05d8422c9d5c27ebfe8f80e6c858647)\n\nThis has predicted the top within about 5 months, exception of '94 though. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Comparisons](https://preview.redd.it/0zqtd3144yt81.png?width=1475&format=png&auto=webp&s=dff90c779a6a9520481562fc83cd2f8f19f2ea68)\n\nFrom this, I can conclude that when we have some recession in the next year, the central bank is just going to print more money and devalue our currency.  This is not a crisis though, no need to keep gold bars under your bed.  Maybe in another 30 years, it will be time to buy gold bars.

The stock market will most likely be fine until June.  I will look back at this in May though.  \n\nJerome Powell will talk Thursday at 1 pm, he may talk about reducing the balance sheet.
