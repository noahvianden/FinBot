{"title": "Cathie selling out is a big deal.", "selftext": "Since ARKK appeared in 2014, it has returned 198%. In the same time BRK has returned 121% and SPY has returned 109%. So Cathie is beating literally everyone even AFTER her fund lost 70% of its value.\n\nNow Cathie has been on a selling spree. She's liquidated a lot of her positions to either nothing or close to nothing. A lot of dullards will swoop in and say Cathie doesn't know what she's doing. But those same people willfully disregard her returns that I described above and really just wish to throw rocks at her.\n\nNo, the reason I think Cathie is selling is because she sees a bigger reversal coming and she doesn't want to be part of it. She probably still has high conviction for all the stocks she's sold but she probably thinks she can get them for 1/2 off.\n\nLook at PLTR--company is financially stable and can easily survive a recession due to strong fundamentals. Thus, there's no real reason to sell PLTR right now if you're planning on holding for years... Unless you're thinking the price is going to go down even more and you want to come in and buy it for even less.\n\nAnd that's what I think is happening right now. I think that Meet Klevin guy was right. I think there are too many negative factors in the market right now to warrant a push up, and I think Cathie sees this and is positioning her fund to take advantage of a shift in the market cycle.\n\n**My positions:** This week basically all my positions lost. Calls on PLTR and AMD for May, both of which are OTM now. And my last position is for $350 SPY Puts in May that I got as insurance against my calls.\n\n**Note:** I'm not trying to spread FUD. If you look at my post history you'll see I've been actively making bullish posts. I'm genuinely hoping we see a bullish reversal, but if we don't I'd rather take a loss on a little bit of my cash rather than all of my cash.

It keeps going up, down ,or sideways?\n2. The “today” price makes the headline but virtually no oil in the world is traded on the “ today” price.  Oil is traded 24 hours in multiple markets based on delivery month, and most physical sales are on a unweighted average based either on the month of delivery or the laycan time if a cargo.  Today oil traded $105, but April 2023 delivery is still under 80. This is a physical market,  someone bought oil for $80 a barrel today that will be delivered a year from now. \n3. USO cannot faithfully track the today market.  It’s value is an average of the front month and m+1, m+2 prices.  If you think the forward curve is wrong and too low, USO will gain value, because it bought contracts today for delivery in June, which is a lot cheaper than the today price.   Ur if the price rises as delivery month comes, USO gains value. If June gets here, higher, USO makes money.  If June gets here lower, USO loses more than the value of lower oil.  Worse, USO hasn’t choice but  to sell its June contract in May because it can’t actually take delivery and the crude market is physical.  This is why oil prices went negative in 2020. Paper traders had to pay people to get out of physical contracts because they do not own infrastructure to store oil. Also, all that infrastructure was full at the time anyhow. Rather than default,  the paper traders paid someone to take their oil.\n4. For gods sake,  go look at cmegroups futures quotes.\n5.  If you think oil is going up higher than the futures curve, go with USO or any oil company that isn’t so in love with climate change that they have committed to stop drilling or isn’t so battered by COVID prices that they can’t grow production as fast as another with a stronger balance sheet. But if you think oil is going up higher than the futures curve, the higher leverage producers benefit slightly better than lower leverage producers.  If you think oil trades sideways or with the forward curve,  the lower leveraged, often high dividend paying producer is probably the way to go.
