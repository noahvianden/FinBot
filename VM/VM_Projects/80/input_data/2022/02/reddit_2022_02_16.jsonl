Some of the world's largest e-commerce brands have moved their entire websites over to Shopify. I work in software development.

Let me answer: building software is fucking expensive. A decent U.S.-based software engineer will set you back a minimum of $150k per year.

That millions of dollars the company is wiping its ass with every year. \n\nGuess who solves these problems? Shopify. Build it once, they maintain it for you.

All we have are clunky immobile headsets that let us into a clearly artificial world. There's no real value to that. The novelty wears off quite quickly once you realize the limitations and how cumbersome it is.\n\nBut, once VR reaches the point of full realism, including haptic feedback realism, it will be the inevitable future. Imagine lying down in a pod and being transported into whatever world you can imagine. Millions of people would line up to escape the bullshit that is their real life. \n\nNot only that, the possibilities become endless. You could escape night, and only live in the day, or vice versa, for example.\n\nImagine VR brothels. No risk of infection or anything else, and conceivably you could bang literally anyone you wanted as many times as you wanted.\n\nThe Meta verse makes perfect sense as the future for most people. There won't be much left to do once AI is in charge of most tasks. The technology just needs to catch up.\n\nGo to work. Come home. Bust a meta nut. Bedtime.

The technology is currently unattractive, but that doesn't mean the actual virtual universe isn't where the world is heading. So if your problem is the headset, then you're agreeing with me.\n\n3.
