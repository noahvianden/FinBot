{"title": "HIMX ðŸš€ðŸš€ incoming with 2/17 earnings?", "selftext": "HIMAX is a solutions provider for every display on the planet with hands in TVs, VR, EVs, monitors and phones. They have seen massive 100%++ run ups on previous earnings dates. Dec20 eps was 0.2 and saw a run from $6 to almost $16. Their currently shorted interest as of 1/14/22 is 22.76m which puts it around 6DTC. Their earnings are coming up on 2/17 premarket. Their EPS expected to be 4x higher than this time a year prior yet they are sitting around the $10-$11 range. They saw a blow up on Q4 closing in December before retreating back down. Iâ€™m fully expecting a 50-80% run towards earnings date. Volume has decreased D2D as the price has retreated. With major companies showing huge fiscal gains this should be a great sign that HIMX will have had a huge year since they provide screen functionality for all these companiesâ€™ devices.

Heavily shorted tho starting about 9 months ago it went from 3 million shares short to 25 million.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I'm a noob to market, serious question: what does this mean for a stock? I understand shorting an unproductive company like Blockbuster but, how would pressure shorting affect a productive company like AMD? In the short and the long term. Also, does this mean that the shorts are betting that sooner or later the company will slip?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Shorting AMD would temporarily decrease the price theoretically.  You sell the share and need to buy it back later and return it.  If there is too much buying pressure then you will lose money on the trade if you buy back the share later.  There are naked shorts too and history of synthetic share practices that may or may not be valid still.\n\n  \nHowever, the volume and MC of AMD is so high that shorting won't really have a huge effect.  Take HIMX for example, you can short one million shares and it will tank the price and set off algorithms to sell more.  Also, shorts can do a lot of things to lower sentiment of a stock.  High short interest can lower the stock.    \n\n\nHIMX was cyclical in the past so the price increase to $15 and gets shorted to $10. Fortunately for Himax's case, if the company is turning it around.  Q4 is going to be the best quarter in their history, 2021 was the highest in history, 2022 is going to be another year of growth.  So now, if it picks up volume and sentiment increases all these 25 million shares eventually will have to close their position and buy a share off the market.  \n\n  \nSo my thesis is that HIMX is going to offer a big dividend this year and have sustained growth for four years straight.  The bear thesis is dying off and the shorts need to buy the shares as sentiment increases.  I see the stock going to $17-18 unless something dramatic happens with Taiwan.", "score": 6, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "Sdc is better", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "They are cheap enough to have both.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Motley Fool canâ€™t shut up about this stock.
