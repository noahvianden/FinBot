{"title": "+$160K gain porn ($SNAP Calls + $SPY Calls)", "selftext": "# All my screenshots can be found here: [https://imgur.com/a/HgDZco2](https://imgur.com/a/HgDZco2)\n\nI started out with **$17K** on Monday hoping to make some good earnings bet this week. \n\n\\- My first win was $UPS call which I gained almost **+$40K**. The thesis I had there was: less bad Winter weathers, surging delivery numbers between people due to Omicron and holidays. (Link: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/sja4lw/42k\\_gains\\_in\\_ups\\_earning\\_call\\_im\\_up\\_a\\_lot\\_this/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/sja4lw/42k_gains_in_ups_earning_call_im_up_a_lot_this/))\n\n\\- On Wednesday, after selling my $UPS calls, I had roughly around **$60K** and I was so happy. So I started swinging $SPY calls and Puts + $FB Calls (pre-earning) which helped me to reach **$90K** on the same day. Yah, it was truly wild experience... I had almost $30K in $FB 350c but I sold like $27K because it was too much risk and I'm thankful for that. \n\n\\- The next day however, I had around $74K to begin with but made a huge mistake swinging $SPY calls and puts which made my account to become around $42K (lost about $25K). I was really pissed and although I gained more from previous days, it felt like I lost money. **So I decided to YOLO into $SNAP calls. I bought $30 calls with 200 contracts which was roughly around \\~$19K.** The thesis was that I thought $SNAP just simply dropped due to $FB and if the earning turns out to be good, I thought it'll at least go back where it was. And fortunately, I was right after the bell.\n\n\\- You can probably see from the screenshot, I gained a huge amount when the bell opened. However, pre-market didn't hold up. If it did, my calls would've been around $160K gains but it was only just over a half of that. So, I didn't feel like it was enough and although I gained money, it felt like I lost money HAHAHA.\n\n\\- So, I started to swing $SPY calls and puts again. However, I thought the job report + Biden talk was already priced in and people wouldn't care much about it. So, I stopped buying puts and went in on buying calls (including $TSLA calls). **This helped me to reach $200K today and right now, I sold everything so that I can enjoy the weekend, let me money settle so that I can cash out $150K and start again with $50K.**", "id": "skkm6t", "created_utc": 1643999473.0, "score": 375, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 85, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|10|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|4|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=skkm6t)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=skkm6t)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "you fucking CHAD. what's your thesis on sq??? you gonna play earnings? with paypal dumping I think sq will pump like snap did.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Congratulations and fuck you", "score": 170, "replies": []}, {"body": "This is definitely sustainable.
