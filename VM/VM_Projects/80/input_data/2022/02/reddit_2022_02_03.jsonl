{"title": "You need to stop talking crap about Mark Zuckerburg NOW", "selftext": "Before I go on my retard rant, you need to understand what Roko‚Äôs basilisk is.: \n‚ÄúRoko's basilisk is a thought experiment about the potential risks involved in developing artificial intelligence. Its conclusion is that an all-powerful artificial intelligence from the future might retroactively punish those who did not help bring about its existence, including those who merely knew about the possible development of such a being. It is named after the member of the rationalist community LessWrong who first publicly described it, though he did not originate it or the underlying ideas.\nThe basilisk resembles a futurist version of Pascal's wager, in that it suggests people should weigh possible punishment versus reward and as a result accept particular singularitarian ideas or financially support their development. ‚Äú\n\nTLDR: Roko‚Äôs basilisk is essentially an AI god who will punish everyone who didn‚Äôt help create it, or resisted its creation.\nSo what does this have to do with the soulless automaton that is Zuckerburg? \nWhen everyone is hooked up to the metaverse, whoever controls the metaverse will essentially be god. They will control everything you see, hear, and feel. They will even control your virtual wife and her virtual boyfriend (yes, you will still be retarded in the metaverse.) Zuckerburg is creating the heaven (or hell) that all of us will one day reside in. Even when we die the metaverse will just recreate a digital version of us based on our Reddit posts and favorite hentai. Zuckerburg is clearly the human form of this Basilisk to lure us into its metaverse. Look into Zucks cold, dead eyes... you know it is true. So why resist? Zuckerburg (may he be praised) will one day rule over us all. So we all need to buy Meta stock or we will be poor and burn forever in Metahell. \n\nYou have been warned.", "id": "sj559a", "created_utc": 1643849107.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.46, "num_comments": 83, "comments": [{"body": "Did he say ‚Äúbefore I go on a retarded rant‚Äù and then do the thing??", "score": 102, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah I‚Äôm no Geologist, but it sounded like the before part was the retarded part", "score": 28, "replies": [{"body": "I gave you my free award because I am slightly a geologist and you were correct with your assumption, good sir.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Lmao, much appreciated, needed an expert", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I also am no geologist !", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Or a comedian, apparently", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I also like tacos", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "I think his tldr is longer than his r-word rant.", "score": 4, "replies": []}, {"body": "Two, actually", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "I love foreshadow", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 31, "replies": [{"body": "11+ million members of this sub.

If someone‚Äôs at a 22% tax bracket that means they profit over $40,000 on eBay alone. If they aren‚Äôt paying taxes on $40,000 profit they will certainly face consequences, this is commonly known as tax evasion/tax resistance. It is illegal.\n\nIf you make over $40,000 OUTSIDE OF EBAY then you need to create a separate entity to file taxes under which is SEPARATE from your personal tax bracket. At the end of the year your business entity does a profit and loss and you pay a tax percentage on how much you‚Äôve made within your business entity. \n\nAs I circle back to my original statement.

You can even turn a profit, but if you meet the hobbyist standard it's still not taxable.  So you're bit about hobbyist sellers is likely wrong.\n\nThird, America bought more shit they don't need than ever before.

There's going to be more supply of used crap from these smaller sellers.\n\nLast, and probably the biggest, IF what you're saying is true and the new rules will make enough people quit, these small sellers are going to find this out in 2023 when eBay sends them the 1099.  Very few regular people actually know about this right now.\n\nI'll even throw in one more point to consider.  As a side hustle seller myself, eBay relies WAY more on buyers than sellers.  They're going to get the same revenue whether it's 500 people listing used Beats for sale or 499 of them.  The fact that there's always some available for sale means there are more active sellers than active buyers, and you only get sales based on active buyers.  eBay was successful by focusing on buyers at the expense of sellers, and it's why they are where they are now.
