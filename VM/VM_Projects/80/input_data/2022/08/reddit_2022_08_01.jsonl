Technically correct, but incomplete.\n\nIt's fine to base your decisions on simplistic metrics, but claiming that officials are \"lying\" if they don't immediately declare a recession based on incomplete data is disingenuous.\n\nWill politicians try to spin all economic news in their favor? Of course! Fortunately, they don't get to decide. In the US, *nobody* can confirm or deny a recession except the National Bureau of Economic Research.\n\nThe US is only officially in a recession when the NBER declares that we are. *That* is the textbook definition, regardless of who edited Wikipedia most recently.\n\nThat said, two quarters of negative growth is bad, and arguably far more actionable to investors than when the recession officially started.\n\nThe declaration of recession is more important to politicians and historians than investors (or it should be if you know what you're doing).  \n\n\n>Also, does this not give figureheads rather than math the power\n\nThere's a reason why a team of non-partisan economists are tasked with calling a recession rather than \"hurr durr two negative quarters\". Every recession is different. Some are caused by sudden shocks (commodities, war, terrorism, pandemic). Others are caused by speculative bubbles or financial crisis, and others are simply the result of the business cycle.\n\nIf you only focus on one simple metric, you might ignore other aspects of the economy. For example, in past recessions, there were never more than 4 million outstanding unfilled job postings when the slowdown began. This time there were 11 million. Recessions usually tank the stock market, but the Covid recession caused tech stocks to moon.\n\nIf you're paying attention to recession overall and not the individual indicators that collectively drag on growth, you're doing it wrong. The market was tanking even before growth went negative. Consumer sentiment was in the toilet for months based on inflation. If you waited for two negative quarters to shift your risk profile, it was already way too late.\n\nhttps://www.npr.org/2022/07/28/1113649843/gdp-2q-economy-2022-recession-two-quarters", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "I appreciate the nuanced explanation and response!

Convincing and arguably decisive evidence the 'bottom is in' — the 2022 bear market is over,\" he said.\n\nLee's confidence stems from the fact that between a negative GDP print, another 75-basis-point interest rate hike from the Fed, and more natural gas volatility due to Russia's Nord Stream pipeline drama, a lot of bad news occurred this week and yet the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 managed to stage a 3% rally.\n\n\"When bad news doesn't take down markets, it is time for investors to assess,\" Lee said.\n\nOn the earnings front, despite a strong US dollar and heightened economic uncertainty, companies are reporting better-than-feared results. With 52% of the S&P 500 having reported second-quarter earnings already, 73% beat profit estimates by a median 7%.\n\nEarnings matter because in the long term that's what drives stock prices.\n\nResults from mega-cap tech behemoths Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, and Apple all eased investor concerns about the resilience of their growth and their ability to manage inflation, which helped drive considerable gains in their stock prices this week.\n\nLee believes the economy has reached the pivot point where incoming data will be decisively less negative, and disinflation tailwinds are set to strengthen. Commodities from metals to oil to grains have been on the decline in recent weeks, which has already resulted in some price declines for consumers.\n\nSource: [https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-outlook-bear-market-over-new-sp500-highs-fundstrat-2022-7](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-outlook-bear-market-over-new-sp500-highs-fundstrat-2022-7)\n\n'The bear market is over' says Tom Lee of Fundstrat.

Lee's always bullish but people have mentioned that already.\n\nThe chart says there's some potential. On Balance Volume and Market Breadth trends show increased strength, and there's accumulation of volume and price correlation built into the most beaten down stocks. We did go up on bad news several times, and we broken several patterns on the SPY chart including a long-term resistance trend going back to early January. \n\nAll of this is still pretty early. It's not uncommon for mid-Bear trends to do things like this in prior corrections/crashes. But this is also mirrors what it looks like when you get an early return of market strength at the beginning of a bull trend.\n\nWhat I look for in OBV is divergence that shows a change in buying behavior. Volume relative to price is flattening out. Next we're looking for it leg up through resistance. That's a solid test for at least a short term bottoming process since a rise in buying volume as measured by OBV reinforces the upward price trend.\n\nSee here's the thing: The early stage of reversals of Bear trends tends have low volume, which feels idiosyncratic, right? \n\nBut it makes sense when you think about it. That's when proven confidence hasn't returned to the market but the default net impact of buying becomes positive on low volume. That's a sign of seller exhaustion, and that causes the unwinding of puts and the covering of short positions, resulting in a cyclical cover event.\n\nIn our case, the major factor is not just earnings or macro anxiety, it's the drawdown of predictably profitable margin levels for funds. The risk free rate of return is declining, energy is declining, the biggest rate hikes are likely behind us (even if we go to 4%, it's unlikely to be via another 75 bps hike unless inflationary problems get WORSE (not the same, worse) then chances are the next hikes will be less.\n\nThat all adds up to a liquidity inflection point where funds and institutions have higher risk appetites AND motivation to deploy funds to not fall behind, and that's where you often get your early change in direction... and anecdotally I've heard that we're seeing that.\n\nBut I'm still skeptical because there are still unknowns and we're still looking for confirmation... and you see very similar trends during short term bull rallies that continue into Bear markets... so I'm playing the uptrend right now (I was playing the downtrend, still have some of those positions open) but am definitely looking for confirmation or breakdown vigilantly. \n\nBut yes, there's reason on the chart to think we might have a bottom, potentially, at least for the short term (1 month timeframe).... but I would not be at all surprised to see it collapse down as early as tomorrow.
