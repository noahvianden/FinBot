{"title": "Can we have an honest discussion on BBBY?", "selftext": "No snide, no insult hurling, no culty or conspiratorial behavior, can we have facts?\n\nObligatory disclosure - I have a very inconsequential short position on BBBY at $26\n\nNow, to the discussion of the recently transpired events. What is the bullish case for BBBY now, really? Let me point out my view of things, along with some (in my opinion) wrong things that have been thrown around\n\n1. Short interest is still high. There is no discussion about that. But the borrow fee is nowhere near prohibitive. Right now it sits at 67%. If a short believes there is at least that downside in a year, or whatever downside they believe there is adjusted for the time they intend to hold, it's perfectly rational to short.  I personally believe the downside is pretty short term, let me elaborate\n2. The filing from yesterday. Let's clear some things out\n\na) The filing is legit. The report even came quite late, if you look at the SEC website [https://www.sec.gov/corpfin/form-144-email](https://www.sec.gov/corpfin/form-144-email) and get the file, the timestamps seem to indicate this document was online already at noon. You all could have been earlier and beat the headline and make a hefty profit, had you known in advance\n\nb) The filing is a clear intention to sell. Form 144 is titled literally NOTICE OF PROPOSAL TO SELL\n\nc) We don't know if Cohen sold yet, or not. Affirming EITHER is the case has no basis. But the fact is that the intention is there, and the filing expressly states that a sell order has been filed with JPM along with the 144 form, to be executed starting 8/16. Why are people denying this?\n\nd) Some people argue that he only wants to sell his options. I'm assuming Cohen is a rational man and if this is the case and he really only wants to sell options, the filing is utterly stupid and self destructive. He could have only filed for selling the options, but no, he's filing for the WHOLE position. He is a whale in BBBY. He KNOWS he is a whale in BBBY. He KNOWS that this filing means an intention to sell. He KNOWS that people are watching his every move, and that this filing would be easily and convincingly interpreted bearishly. WHY, if he's rational, would he make a move that tanks his own position if he intends to hold?\n\ne) Some people argue that he was obligated to file a 144 form because of 10% ownership only. This is incorrect, the only required form is 13D, which he did file on the same day, or one day earlier. There is no obligation to file a 144 if you have no intention to sell.\n\nf) Some people argue that he cannot sell until late September without forfeiting the gains because of Section 16b. This is incorrect. Section 16b only applies for profits on purchases and sales (or sales and purchases) where BOTH operations are performed when the agent is an officer of the corporation or holds 10% equity. Cohen's purchases were done at a time where he held 0% equity, section 16b does not apply at all.\n\n3) Late yesterday, BBBY came with a statement that reads, quote\n\n>BED BATH & BEYOND SAYS PLEASED TO HAVE REACHED CONSTRUCTIVE AGREEMENT WITH RC VENTURES IN MARCH & ARE COMMITTED TO MAXIMIZING VALUE FOR ALL SHAREHOLDERS  \n>  \n>BED BATH & BEYOND SAYS HAVE BEEN WORKING EXPEDITIOUSLY OVER PAST SEVERAL WEEKS WITH EXTERNAL FINANCIAL ADVISORS, LENDERS ON STRENGTHENING BALANCE SHEET\n\nIf you have read enough of these statements, you'd know that \"PLEASED TO HAVE REACHED CONSTRUCTIVE AGREEMENT WITH RC VENTURES IN MARCH\" usually means they don't really agree on terms and are moving forward separately. This FULLY explains RC getting out of the position.\n\nAlso, BED BATH & BEYOND SAYS HAVE BEEN WORKING \\[...\\] WITH EXTERNAL FINANCIAL ADVISORS, LENDERS ON STRENGTHENING BALANCE SHEET. This means in 99% of the cases that a cash raise and dilution is incoming.\n\nBoth of the above are, of course, my opinion only and open to interpretation.\n\n4) and this is the one that bugs me the most, why the rationalization? I propose the mental exercise of imagining that it wasn't RC filing this 144, but the board members. I would bet hard cash that this sub would be all over kicking and insulting the board for \"not believing in the company\", \"lining their own pockets\", etc, etc. Why do you behave so differently when RC files the same?\n\nI welcome respectful discussion, I will promptly ignore nonsensical attacks, as I have not made any attacks on my side at all (I believe)\n\nEDIT - Even though I'm of the opinion above, I also honestly think RC is not being malicious here, nor pumping and dumping, at all. I think the board is blocking him, his plan did not work, and he wants out.\n\nEDIT 2- many comments pointing out that he files this just in preparation if he ever wants to sell. Can anyone point me to a similar filing for GME? As far as I can find, he has never filed intention to sell on GME.
