In 1975, it was a 200 lb piece of furniture with a 23 inch screen and a shitty picture. If you wanted to change the channel without getting up, you had to birth a small child to assume the role of knob turner. Also, for most people (like me) who grew up in the sticks, there were between 1 and 3 channels, depending on whether nature was cooperating at the moment. If you missed something on TV, that was it. You just missed it. There was no \"on-demand\". No Youtube. No reruns. Channel scarcity was real, so lots of events happened once and that was it.

Sorry for the rant, here is your answer in short sentences: \n\nA 2% inflation target is just enough to keep economy (companies, households, consumers like you & me) spending money rather than saving which fuels economic growth. Also it incentivices investments over saving. Overshotting this 2% target is bad because prices are rising too fast and create too much pressure for companies, consumers etc. A significantly lower inflation than 2% is bad as well because money is rather saved than spend / invested and therefor this will drain the economy from the stuff that keeps it running: money / liquidity", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "I just needed a simple definition.

Keep us happy enough not not riot but not comfortable enough to enjoy life.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Reasons given from my money and banking class and pretty much any article you google as to why a low level of inflation is good or better than zero:\n1. If deflation is expected consumers will defer purchases to when products are cheaper, reducing economic output. Related to #5\n2. Debt financing is an important part of the capital system, deflation discourages borrowing\n3. Stuff gets better over time, and is made cheaper over time, so it should cost more.\n4. Equity financing is important because you want capital ‚Äúinvested‚Äù not stuffed in a mattress.\n5. Deflation results in a downward spiral,  people spend less,  business produce less and hire less, suppressing demand,  making people spend less, making business produce less,  etc. the upward spiral of increased demand is better.\n6. The government needs to be able to spend money it doesn‚Äôt have in times of war, etc.\n \n\nI have thought a lot about this and I‚Äôve decided this is what I think of each of those reasons (my armchair opinion and sorry for the novel): \n\n1.  This is only true for discretionary spending,  if I knew my dollars would be worth more tomorrow, I‚Äôd still have to eat, pay rent, drive to work, etc. today.  Deflation harms borrowers and spenders, and vice versa. Inflation harms savers and lenders. And vice versa.\n2.  Debt financing includes a reasonable expectation of inflation or deflation.  You may be willing to lend at 1% if you expect 3% deflation,  or lend at 6% if you expect 2% inflation.  Same real return to you. Either way, debt markets would be capable of addressing this; they assign a premium to the debt when the stated rate is too high relative to deflation or lack of inflation or risk. In this way, you can still issue debt in a negative interest rate environment.\n3.  If stuff gets better and cheaper over time,  why shouldn‚Äôt the consumer have that benefit? I see no reason why the government should devalue currency for this?  Also,  chicken, flour, and gasoline, have not improved since 1957, but cost 10x as much?  Why are TVs always trotted out as the sole example?  Cars are better, sure, but 10x better?  Absolutely not. \n4.  In a defLationary environment,  the expected return on equity would likewise adjust as debt does.  If the risk of your business means I should earn a 10% return,  then I should get 8% if I expect 2% deflation and a full cash return of capital.  If instead, as many investments do these days, return only in capital gain and appreciation of the business, then the value of the business should increase by 12% per annum. If Hence why the markets PE ratio is so high during periods of high inflation,  investors are willing to take a lower return since holding cash is a negative return.\n5. I find this completely idiotic as an explanation, though it‚Äôs probably the most common given.  The idea that business will produce less because nominal prices are falling is as ridiculous as saying they are producing more when prices are rising,  no!  The value expressed in monetary terms changes,  but the actual inflation/deflation adjusted production remains the same.  Also, even if they do ‚Äúand hire less workers‚Äù non discretionary spending is quite inelastic.  Also, if prices are falling consumers will demand a higher quantity, pushing prices back up.  The downward deflation spiral is a dumb argument, and has only happened once in the US due to the Great Depression, the causes of which were multiple and mostly due to government interference.\n6.  Government can always borrow money like the rest of us.  Inflation is just a wealth tax except it‚Äôs regressive as all hell, since the wealthy have the means to allocate their wealth to investments and us poors keep a lot of our wealth in cash (proportionately) to survive our paycheck to paycheck lives.  Also,  investment values move with inflation, mostly, so it floats the wealthy boat.  Salaries are sticky and do not move well with inflation, so it swamps the poors canoes. \n\nIn my opinion the 2% inflation target is nothing more than the government saying it‚Äôs going to reduce the debt on its balance sheet by 2% per annum, and also the cash in your pocket. It might do that at 10% per annum when it‚Äôs politically expedient, like it has been for the last 2 years or so.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Eat my dongus you fuckin nerd.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
