{"title": "I might have just created a brilliant strategy", "selftext": "Okay, so this all started when I wanted to dip my feet into the wild-west of volatility arbitrage. There isn't much practical literature around on it, but the core concept was simple: eliminate exposure to all other greeks, and profit from changes in volatility. So over the past few months, I started exploring and eventually started trading a strategy that I haven't seen anywhere else, so here it goes. \n\n**Background**\n\nWe all know that the market likes Black-Scholes, but Black-Scholes lacks in some important ways, the biggest ones being that it doesn't account for dividends, large price moves, or most importantly, the expiration risk premium. Since Black-Scholes are for European options, it doesn't factor in that the option can be exercised at any time. However, market prices do account for this extra risk, and it is a large reason why if you price an option with Black-Scholes, the market price and calculated price will be pretty far off. \n\nLuckily, the Barone-Adesi and Whaley (BAW) model captures this extra risk perfectly by adding a slight tweak to the Black-Scholes model. Without going into the granularity of differential equations, the BAW model accounts for the risk that the option can be exercised at any time and adds that value to the Black-Scholes value. It isn't mandatory to know it's formulaic derivation, but [here](https://ir.nctu.edu.tw/bitstream/11536/14182/1/000264318900005.pdf) is a research paper reference for those interested. \n\nIn case you didn't know, implied volatility is just a variable that is backed out from the Black-Scholes model. So, all things considered, we are also able to back out implied volatility from the BAW model, except this IV will be more efficient and accurate. Our profit comes from collecting the spread of:\n\n**Calculated IV** \\- **Market IV** = **Profit**\n\nGreat, we have an efficient measure of IV! Only, how the hell do we target this? I'm retail just like you, so the options like replicating a variance swap or hedging a short call are just way out of my price range. This capital limit restricts this strategy to only going long volatility. When you lock into a defined-risk straddle, betting that IV will increase, delta-hedging becomes extraordinarily cheap. It sounds scary and expensive, but as you'll see below, it really isn't. \n\n**Strategy**\n\nOkay, so we know that we can only trade if we're expecting IV to go up. So first, we have to find options that meet that criteria. There are a lot of ways to determine these stocks, you can use upcoming earnings for example, but I personally go with the following \n\n* Have an IV at least 5% lower than the 20-day historical IV\n* Are no more than 5% out-of-the-money\n* Expire in less than 30 days\n\nI use the OpenBB screener with those parameters and get the following output:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lvw8ljtk6cg91.png?width=1250&format=png&auto=webp&s=f14a077c8905cc0a9e7044eec5979a10c9d501d7\n\nNow, let's check if the IV is right. I first plug the call values into the BAW model and back-out IV using the bisection method (research paper [here](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13504850701591325?journalCode=rael20)). \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vzm2p6jh6cg91.png?width=988&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6e91c8a702c8ff6465006a35b39afc45c160c39\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qz26fv5j6cg91.png?width=253&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0edded21661e16e9d25a6273c0ed7902d578f28\n\nAs pictured, the IV of the call according to the BAW model is in actuality about 5% higher than that quoted by the market. When pricing the put, the IV is about 3% higher. \n\nNow, it's clear what needs to happen. I must long these two positions and hedge my delta so that I make money if IV goes up. The fun begins. \n\nI buy the call and put for a net cost of $765. When the order is filled, the starting delta is 2.48. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/te6zvfxc6cg91.png?width=756&format=png&auto=webp&s=9cb43caf3ccb344e81b4922b64b7d02526ec23fa\n\nThis means that for each dollar the stock moves, the position makes/loses \\~$2. We do not want that risk. We want our delta to be neutral, so we short 2 shares of AAPL. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/et3jbfkd6cg91.png?width=676&format=png&auto=webp&s=6890273e771471677b945a3b744c565554e0b6cc\n\nThat's it. That's all delta-hedging is. Over the lifespan of the option and over the day, the deltas will oscillate up and down, but for a stock like AAPL, this range is typically small, only requiring you to hedge a few times in either direction. \n\nNow that the position is delta-hedged, you are exposed to just the change in volatility (gamma too, but since you're dynamically hedging, it isn't a significant risk).\n\n**Profit**\n\nAs expected, the IV of the position increased. By 10 minutes before market close, the implied vol of the call increased from 21% to 27%, and the implied vol of the put increased from 21% to 24%. This allowed me to sell the call for 495 and the put for 435, for a total of 930 ($165 profit).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tm2x2d2a6cg91.png?width=792&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfc55bc977ad073e566cf2c5cda83b5098f1a950\n\nDon't just take my word for it, you can pull the historical data and see exactly how this trade played out.
