I’ve seen some companies’ actuarial data, and its results are  \ncomparable to what was said on the Q3 2021 earning call.

Low take rate on telematics. Especially if  \ncustomers want to drive the cars to their performance levels.   \n   \nCustomers want the best coverage for the lowest possible  \nprice and top-notch claims and customer service. Insurance is a complicated  \nlegal contract based on each states laws. It will take many years to enter  \nthese markets competitively.

Price  \ncan’t be your only advantage, if it is, your underlying fundamentals may not be  \nsound.  \n   \nUntil laws change about driver liability, re: FSD (I’m a  \nBeta Tester), I’m bearish on Telsa Insurance.

The worst market cap valuation I have seen in many years.\n2. PIF and the other large investors have paper hands. I think that they will gradually sell off a big chunk off their 1B shares.\n3. No earnings.\n4. No revenue.\n5. Biiiig yearly losses. Biiig negative cashflow.\n6. Lucid has been slow to get things done - 7 years in, and they still are not able to deliver cars in volume. Compare this to Tesla - a company that moves fast and keeps moving forward. Even GM is moving faster.\n7. Insiders and hedge funds have sold off a biiig chunk of their shares. For instance, the CEO seems to own only 0.8%. Also HF Magnetar Financial sold off 94.15% of their shares 16.8 million shares (see 1/7/2022 13G/A fillings). ***If the insiders and the smart money don't believe in the company - why should we?***\n8. Fake rumors around LCID like 'Apple may buy Lucid' are plentiful. These rumors appear to come from social media accounts that only report on Lucid. I smell a P&D.\n9. ***Inflation*** has hit most 'growth' stocks on the NYSE - but it has not yet hit LCID. I think will hit LCID hard, and that small apes will be left holding the bag.\n10. The FED may take away the punch bowl. If they do LCID will be a victim.\n11. After looking at the technology behind the Lucid car, I don't understand why this car company is assumed to have superior tech. They seem to use similar batteries, engines, etc as other competitors. For instance they are way after Toyota in battery technology (look at T's patent portfolio), and GM in autonomuos driving (look at Cruise's successful pilot in San Francisco). ***Who will pay $170k for a manually driven Lucid that takes hours to charge - instead of $100k for a self-driving Cadillac, Lexus or Mercedes with fast-charging battery?***\n12. It is starting to look like Russia could actually invade Ukraine. If they do, fear will spread, and a $60Billion company that losses money, and has almost no deliveries will likely get hit hard.\n\nBut it is your money. And I shared the info I have available.\n\nDisclaimer: I am a retard. I own puts on LCID. This is not financial advice. And I want a banana.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlmost forgot...
