{"title": "The Silver Tsunami: How will Baby Boomer retirements affect U.S. employment and stocks?", "selftext": "According to Wikipedia, the median baby boomer was born in 1955 which puts them at age 66 today. Much has been said about employers having trouble finding qualified workers recently, and it has been attributed to the pandemic, unemployment benefits, and working age adults switching careers or quitting their jobs entirely. Demographically, however, all of this ignores the elephant in the room.\n\nAnyone who’s a millennial has probably heard at a young age that “tons of jobs will open up once all the baby boomers retire.” Well, guess what? That’s happening right now, in addition to all the ramifications of a global pandemic and a collective reevaluation of our purpose in life.\n\nAll this is to say, we have hit peak boomer. And all the baby boomer stock BUYERS are soon going to become stock SELLERS.\n\nI listened to Mad Money last Wednesday, and Jim Cramer had his “Are You Diversified?” segment where people call in and ask him about their top 5 holdings. This Hank Hill sounding guy calls in and said his top stocks are Southern Company (SO), Verizon (VZ), ConocoPhillips (COP), Phillip Morris (PM), and Union Pacific (UNP). These are not stocks I would own, except maybe UNP, and I don’t see anyone here ever talk about them. But I am younger and can understand why someone his age and demographic would own these.\n\nMy point is, while boomer stocks are widely acclaimed right now due to impending interest rate hikes, I posit that these stocks will soon face long-term secular *outflows* that will continue throughout the Millennial generation’s working years. Furthermore, when some Millennials ultimately inherit their boomer parents' and grandparents' stocks (with the all-important step-up in cost basis), how many Millennials are going to hοdl grandpa’s ConocoPhillips stock when they could instantly diversify or invest in literally anything else tax-free?\n\nTl;dr: Baby boomers are retiring and boomer stocks will be sold off like the dickens.

At 100k AMC is at a 50 trillion market cap. There's only about 40 trillion \"dollars\" on the planet.\nWith this scenario alone you can see that the math doesn't add up, and that's not including any other stock squeeze or any of their synthetic shares....Could it reach 100k?

Unless your property is incredibly unique, incredibly expensive, etc. If you are buying / selling some random cookie cutter subdivision house, cookie cutter condo, like so many people in this country ... they provide very little value. Bare minimum regulatory requirements, like legal disclosures, and that's nearly it. This is the exact reason why huge volumes of sales are moving to discount rebate companies like Redfin and others. On a $300k sale, 2.5% to buyer and 2.5% to seller??? That's $15k freaking dollars. For very low skill work. It's absolute insanity. So that very fat margin is being eroded away. I recently used a 1% guy that had been around for a while as the industry evolved into the modern online equivalent. And he was super blunt about it. Back in the day when you had limited public access to the MLS, when you had to do research much more manually, when you had to build and schedule showing days, when listings propagated much more slowly ... the agent cost made more sense. Today, the vast majority of that has been automated and eliminated as work for him. And while the 2.5% lingers around, agents are trying to scoop up that gravy train.
