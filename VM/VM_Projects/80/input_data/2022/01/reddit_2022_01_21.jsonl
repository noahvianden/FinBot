After earnings it dropped similar to Netflix, just not as much. A few weeks later it tanks again. I made the mistake of buying the dip too early.\n\nInterest rates haven’t even started yet. Netflix is only showing us what is coming. Look at 2016 stock prices. Look at how much shit has gone up, and you think a 20% correction at $400 is an insane buying opportunity? Are you insane? \n\nHere’s a buying opportunity. Back in 2020, AMC was trading at $2. This is not me telling you to yolo into amc in 1/22. Again, not a good buying opportunity has come for amc yet. \n\nI saw it, said wow. Amc isn’t gonna be there forever. I insisted it would go up to $32, it’s 2017 price. I didn’t think movie theaters would go away.\n\nI held, opened my app in January 21’ to see amc at $16. I was shocked, but held. I ended up selling at march 21’. I was right about it, but I never got to see the huge profits. Still sold at $9. \n\nThat is a dip buying opportunity. When a stock is trading at ridiculous low levels and obviously has room for upside potential. I did the same thing with American Airlines back when Covid hit. \n\n\nDon’t just yolo into shares because it tanked.\n\nEdit: and Netflix drops $50 more. LMAO.

{"title": "Why tomorrow spy will bounce", "selftext": "Tomorrow is option expiration day. There is 1.3 trillion in single stock options set to expire. This creates a situation know as gamma squeeze tomorrow. \n\nSimply put, when gamma is high, price movement in underlying causes large delta changes in the options. What this means is as prices go down, it generally will create more downward pressure and same for prices going up.\n\nSo why do I think it will go up instead of down? A combination of reverse wsb, TA, and media sentiment. Today is first day where retail has done more selling than buying since December. Wsb board is also filled with bears even this morning when things are up. Inverse wsb usually works. Retards are generally gonna retard and be wrong. \n\nMoving on to the technical analysis, we are above the 200 day which is 442 on SPY. We are right now at 445 in after hours. This means we only have a little to go before hitting 200 day moving average which should get a bounce. If you go back to 2019, we have bounced a few times with only 2020 covid crash breaching the 200 day.\n\nLastly, media sentiment of today's trading action has bought a shift in tone. Before today, the sell offs were orderly with some bashing on growth stocks and pumping financials and consumer Staples boomer stocks. However today's media talking points has shifted towards wondering when the bottom is in.\n\nI believe we will see strong buy the dippers here because it is the most logical place to place bids. It's a Friday going into fed week, with no green days for past 3 days. Today marks the 3rd red day the broad market has experienced. As spy approaches 200 day and it being a great way to screw wsb, hedgies, market makers and funds will most likely use this opportunity to try to squeeze up into a relief rally.\n\nMy positions are spy 0dte calls and I will add more if we do go higher due to gamma squeeze of opex around 10am. \n\nAlso I could be totally wrong and spy goes down 2% tomorrow and breaches 4420 and heads to 4300 right away with no bounce.
