{"title": "Options with Training Wheels aka Defined Outcome Investing", "selftext": "When people want to dip their toes into options, so often they start with buying single leg options because it seems simpler to grasp. But what they don't realize is that they're playing a losing game and when the market moves against them, the results can be disastrous. Counter-intuitively, more complicated option strategies are actually safer and provide higher probability of winning. When you create spreads with options, you can achieve what we call \"defined outcome investing.\"\n\nInstitutional investors and the top 1% have been using defined outcome investing products for decades (in the form of structured notes and annuities and more recently unit investment trusts and exchange-traded funds). Retail investors should have access to the same tools to achieve less risk and a defined return on their investments in the market. \n\n## How Does Defined Outcome Investing Work? \n\nFirst, let’s define some terms that are relevant to defined outcome investing: \n\n**Reference asset -** Each defined outcome investment is linked to the performance of a reference stock, ETF, or index. \n\n**Reference price -** This is the price of the reference stock, ETF, or market index.\n\n**Outcome period -** A defined outcome investment is not infinite. It is an option contract with a set time period.  \n\n**Cushion -** The cushion is the amount of the underlying asset price can go down before you lose any of your investment. In other words, this is the amount of safety blanket you have for your investment against the market.\n\n*Example:* If the market index **reference asset** falls by 18%, but your defined outcome investment has a buffer of 15%, then you will only lose 3% overall. The cushion has absorbed most of the decline. Some popular buffers are set to 9%, 15%, or 30%.\n\n**Ceiling -** The ceiling is a cap on the maximum amount of profit you can receive as the underlying reference asset price goes up. You are cap your upside in exchange for the buffer.\n\n*Example:* Say that the reference asset price soars by 35% but your upside cap is 30%. You would collect up to the first 30% of the reference asset’s increase, and miss out on 5% of the gain.  \n\n\nWhen you combine these concepts into a defined outcome investment strategy, you can create security for your investment, even during market volatility. The contract of the defined outcome investment is set for the outcome period. You can withdraw early if the value reaches your target profit earlier. \n\n## What Are the Benefits?\n\n* **Customizable risk-return profiles**  \nWith defined outcome investing, you can personalize your risk-return profile to align with your long-term strategy. You can be conservative or aggressive. Your buffer can be set to absorb downside volatility while keeping your cap high enough to help you reach your financial goals. Or if you're particularly bullish on an asset you can accelerate the upside in exchange for a ceiling on the profit.  \n\n* **Income Generation**  \nYou can define certain outcomes to provide a fixed return that is superior to bonds and CDs while taking a reasonable level of risk. \n\n## What kind of Outcomes Can be Achieved?\n\nThere are three main objectives that can be achieved with defined outcome investing:   \n\n\n1. **Income / Preservation**  \n*Best for investors who want to preserve capital, even in a down market.*   \nThe preservation strategy offers maximum cushion and a fixed return. The drawback to this strategy is that the ceiling is typically lower than with other strategies. Put spreads are commonly used for this objective.   \n‍  \n*Example*:   \nBuy 1 $120 put  \nBuy 3 $125 puts  \n Sell 5 $135 puts    \n1/20/23 expiration   \nNets a fixed **13%** **(13%** **annualized)** unless $AAPL falls below **18%** (**$133.97**) as of 01/20/2023 \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/16b0uwj3xfe81.png?width=1428&format=png&auto=webp&s=f8081f60dde9506784f16a8a6d9a553a699e246f\n\n1. **Growth**  \n*Best for bullish investors who want to collect profits earlier*  \nThe growth strategy is on the opposite end of the spectrum in terms of risk. There is typically no downside protection, but in exchange for the ceiling you get accelerated profit.   \n*Example*:    \nBuy 2 $160 calls   \nSell 2 $170 calls   \nSell 1 $170 put    \n9/16/22 expiration   \nAccelerates gains by **3.2x** and makes up to **20.8% (34.7% annualized)** on $AAPL through 9/16/2022. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bdehv87pyfe81.png?width=1426&format=png&auto=webp&s=de7f88d8c9525f6b0c4e34aefcb5369cfc0d42ed\n\n1. **Hedged / Buffered**  \n*Best for medium risk, medium reward long term investors*   \nThis is the meeting of the two above strategies and is the most popular for defined outcome investing. You set a ceiling and a cushion that keeps your investment within parameters that match your objectives and outlook on that asset.  \n*Example*:   \nBuy 1 $160 call  \nSell 1 $185 call  \nSell 1 $140 put  \n11/18/22 expiration  \nMakes up to **18.3% (23.1% annualized)** unless $AAPL falls below **13%** (**$143.19**) as of 11/18/2022\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lqd2zudvzfe81.png?width=1422&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d8fc58716a459ac00a7c1b84381812de6d4b841\n\nWould love to see a shift in how beginners approach options trading and even out the playing field.
