You want to buy bonds right before interest rates are lowered, so investors are dumping bonds and rising the 10yr.\n\nEx: KO (CocaCola) last year offered a 5%, 10yr bond for $1,000. This year after the rising of interest rates, KO will offer a 6%, 10yr bond for $1,000. Everyone wants the 6% yield, they don‚Äôt want the 5% bond that someone bought last year, so if that someone wants to get out of their 5% bond they won‚Äôt fetch $1000, they‚Äôll get like $925 for it. So right now people are dumping their bonds in anticipation of being able to buy higher yield bonds later in the year, and this is pushing the 10yr and all bond rates higher", "score": 194, "replies": [{"body": "I sort of wish you went on a few tangents and just kept on explaining stuff.  I would keep reading.", "score": 44, "replies": [{"body": "Lol, uh okay, a tangent it is:\n\nSo again, the guy who bought the 5% KO bond last year, if he does nothing for 9 more years, he‚Äôll collect his 5% every year and then on the last year of the bond he‚Äôll get his $50 coupon and his initial $1,000 back. If he‚Äôs cool with that, he‚Äôs fine. \n\nBut if he ever plans to sell his bond before maturity, interest rate changes will affect the bond price, and the more time he has left in the bonds life (the bond‚Äôs duration) the more his bond‚Äôs price will be affected. \n\nThe past few years where interest rates (basically) haven‚Äôt changed, KO has just issued a new lot of 5% 10yr bonds year after year. Let‚Äôs assume they have issued a new lot of 5% bonds every year the past ten years. Someone who bought a 5% bond 9 years ago, their bond has a duration of 1 year since there‚Äôs only 1 year left in its life. Someone who bought a new 5% bond this year has a fresh 10 years duration left.\n\nIf the market collectively and suddenly assumes interest rates are about to raise 1% in the next year, the guy with the 1 year duration left on his bond doesn‚Äôt really give a shit because he can just take his 5% instead of 6% on his bond for one more year and get his $1,000 back next year. He‚Äôs not missing out on a lot of return. But the guy who has 10 years left is kinda fucked, because he‚Äôs gonna miss out on 1% yield every year for the next 10 years. And for him, the market might even assume interest rates will move up 3% in ten years, so when the fed threatens to raise interest rates fast, the bonds with lots of duration (time) left in their lifetime get their price dropped the most. The bonds expiring soon, are way less affected. \n\nSo, Imo, the bond market is freaking out that the Fed‚Äôs sudden heightened concerns about inflation means they will raise interest rates 1% this year, and all bond prices will drop, longer duration bonds prices will drop the most. So they are panicking and selling now, even though the Fed hasn‚Äôt even raised rates once yet. Consequently, stock investors see the 10yr rising and foresee companies that don‚Äôt make money yet and borrow a lot of money are gonna grow slower because they have to pay 1% more on the money they borrow. \n\nI think it‚Äôs a little overdone though. The Fed is on the side of the market, that‚Äôs clear, they won‚Äôt hike 4 times this year. Also, there‚Äôs only so much more bond selling that can occur, as most of the people buying bonds are managers of pensions and mutual funds that have mandated bond purchases they must make. It‚Äôs not a decision, they HAVE to keep buying bonds, which will help keep rates from going much higher. \n\nThe jump we saw in the ten year last week was a lot, but it‚Äôll stop going up or slow down a lot this week unless the market freaks out even more about another bad inflation number or JPow says something stupid on Tuesday. Bonds selling will slow and the ten he will stabilize. Historically it‚Äôs lived above 3% but I don‚Äôt see it there for a few more years.

So, on the secondary bond market, if you wanted out of your 1.5% bond for any reason, you‚Äôd have to sell your 1.5% bond for a price to make it equivalent to a current new rate 3% bond.
