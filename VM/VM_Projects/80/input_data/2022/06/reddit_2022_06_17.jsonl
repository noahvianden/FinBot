Nor does it prove your point when people stop replying to you.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Follow along. Maybe you will then learn a couple of things.\n\n1) So they are also technically, HYBRID ICE vehicles as well. Do you see how that classification is troublesome? There's a reason why PHEV and EV numbers are reported separately. Check VW's financials. They don't report hybrids as EV's for the obvious reason that they aren't EV's for the most common purposes. Some auto companies have also been pushing PHEV's because local governments have been charging huge fees based on whether your vehicle 'qualifies' as clean or not. PHEV's was a financial incentive for auto companies to push.\n\n2) Manufacturers are moving away from PHEV because they aren't useful when EV's outperform them. PHEV's made sense when the battery technology was not at the point where the range and pricing was sufficient. We are far past that.\n\n3) Bringing up Ferrari plays no role in any of this. You're just adding a random piece of info that has no bearing on the discussion. Anyways, Tesla is by far more profitable than Ferrari. We're talking about margins. Tesla isn't in the business of luxury exotic vehicles. What are you going to compare next? Gordon Ramsay's restaurant to a local McDonald's? They don't operate in the same business.\n\n4) Governments are forcing them to by way of taxation and high fees. Maybe you haven't realized but ICE companies pay a carbon tax for every ICE vehicle they produce. That is why Tesla was making billions off their regulatory credits by selling them to ICE automakers. In many European countries, such as Norway, you receive priority parking. Norway, it costs significantly less to own an EV than an ICE because Norway also charges an insane tax on ICE vehicles. In China, you are allowed to be in a specific lane that has much less traffic if you drive an EV. Government is practically demanding that the future of cars be EV's.\n\n5) I work Big 4 and VW is one of our clients. There is literally no reason for VW and other ICE automakers to not mention EV profits if they exist. They are highly encouraged to do so by their accountants if they indeed exist. The reason they aren't doing it is because it isn't a pretty picture to paint to investors when they are bleeding money on every EV they sell. \n\nI don't really care, either. You can believe what you want. List the pros/cons of not listing out EV profits vs listing them out. You can't find a single con to listing their EV profit separately. It's about being logical, here. Being right? Volkswagen can easily come out and say they are profitable selling EV's in their earnings call. Have you listened to them? I have. Just a year ago, they stated they were losing thousands of dollars selling their ID EV. Ford just came out and stated that they lose money selling every Mach-E. GM came out and stated that they lost money selling every Chevy Bolt. Maybe update your knowledge before coming into a topic without a logical approach.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "Tesla says it's profitable.
