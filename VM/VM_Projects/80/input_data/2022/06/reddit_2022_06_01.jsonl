First of all, give yourself a nice pat on your shoulder and be proud that we stuck for this finale together and dig deep. I mean, we had to dig really, really deep for this when everywhere around were chatting about the end-of-the world talks. But we kept our heads cool DCA'ed in our favorite index called Nasdaq, for the month of may. Didn't buy a bunch of stocks, but you know, i will never ever advise you that. But unfortunately, I broke that promise last week by buying a portfolio. So ahhhh. Kinda did, but also kinda didn't. That portfolio though, is crushing it on Wall Street.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBefore we begin our favorite months June - July - August which you already know are going to be good, ( we proved it in our previous posts ) i want to say that it was fun talking about things in the bear market. So I came to the conclusion that if I am wrong and we just go up forever after August and never look back, I will stop these weekly posts. All you will be hearing from me is after FOMC week. Now I know only a tiny fraction of you will be sad,( most of them hate my crayons and rgb drawings with TL; dr. posts XD ) but guys, you have to understand i am just a terrible guy to follow in the bull market. There are literally thousand of financial gurus of green market out there. Every one of them is much better than this monkey over here. It's the sad bear markets that are my specialty. I thrive on things like Bear rallies, Stagflation, Depression, Recession and listening to people talk about their ex. So whenever those fears start coming back again, you will be hearing a lot from me each and every single  week. I don't care if things become bearish for 10yrs, you will still hear from me. And that is my promise to you. WSB.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEnough of my BS, but this time we wont rewind the week. Instead, lets get to the point quickly\n\n.\n\n**Summary of QT**\n\nQt 2015-19 vs Qt 2021-24\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[2015-19 tightening cycle](https://preview.redd.it/xv7ddsdo00391.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=e875b1929eca74044300868d1eb63157164a5315)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[2021 - 202X tightening cycle](https://preview.redd.it/5v3hhzyu00391.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=94631a4bf609dac600e2c64471099422e6b33958)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-> Max cap $47.5B/m starting June 1 and 95B/m starting september 1. But theoretically we would never achieve it. Hence $85B/m max cap. Will explain later why. Last cycle the max we went was $50B/m.\n\n\\-> Market is already anticipating Qt, hence bonds are selling off. By the end of 2024 Fed will remove $2T/8.6T from the system.\n\n\\-> This money goes into RRP. It's like a black hole for excess liquidity sucking deposits out of the banking system into money market funds.\n\n\\-> In picture above, area b/w white line is tightening, which begins with rate increases and when rates around 1% QT starts. Red lines are Qt announced and begin one month after. The orange line is when we will pivot from rate hikes. Right now this cycle we dont know yet. Maybe June FOMC 13-14 economic projections will clear it.

Interest rate on deposit lags even though there is an increase in interest rate in rrp when FED is hiking.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is so because banks have been stuffed with a lot of deposits over the last couple of years. The excess liquidity in the system should insulate it against a potential increase in deposit pricing from rate hikes, which should then benefit banks cost of funds and net interest margins as loan yields reprice faster than deposits.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA deposit beta = relative change in deposit / change in interest rate from Fed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis indicator will be lagging the deposit betas in money market fund industry and are expected to rise more slowly than experienced in prior rate rising cycle given unprecedented levels of liquidity on balance sheets, the low level of alternative market interest rates and Fitch forecast for positive yet below average loan growth.\n\nBanks are likely to allow excess deposits to run off before restricting deposits upwards, which should support net interest income and margins as banks control funding costs while taking advantage of higher asset yields.\n\nLets say Fed hikes 100bps rn with target 2.5% by end of the year. Your checking account is still 0 bps, so when Fed raises rates rrp goes higher and then money funds offer higher yields, so there might be competition there with commercial banks offering nothing. Hence there will be movement from banking sector to money market funds. By the way, money market funds have management fees anywhere, b/w lets says 25-50 bps. So if 100bps is the Fed funds rate right now, then investors only get 75-50bps.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2. Why are bill yields trading below rrp? (rrp 30bps 4w bills at 20bps and 8w at 28bps)**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[TGA vs RRP 1:1](https://preview.redd.it/og75evbb30391.png?width=1483&format=png&auto=webp&s=80c14552bcb5caceb475d2a23a84869fe8a8fd48)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nArgument 1 :\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTga (Treasury general account) was very large. Now tga is coming down and rrp is going higher. This has been happening 1:1 recently.\n\nAlso, there is a bill shortage in front end which will partially feed into rrp action. The issuance of treasury over next 6-12m will probably input how long rrp stays large.\n\nPart of the reason why money market funds don't want the treasury bill right now and rather stick it in rrp is because they are not profit seeking entities. Their first concern is the safety of their investment. Treasury fund are uncertain right now. They don't want duration risk. Although there is probably never going to be a loss for them since they will be holding them to maturity, but they don’t want to hold something which goes down in value when the Fed is hiking.\n\nBut if Treasury fed funds rate becomes certain and the treasury market start issuing some more bills and as banking system maybe starts to bid deposit away from money market fund as reserve balance starts to get scarce, probably will start to see rrp come down in 6m or so, then treasury might become attractive.\n\nIn the beginning period of Qt we might see rrp go up.\n\nEx : Lets say a 2yr Treasury bill costs $100 and fed hikes so the price now is $98. You will never realize this loss. But you'll see red so they park in rrp. Rrp is like Fed's attempt to supply collateral to a market that has too much liquidity.\n\nMoney market funds are very conservative about what they buy. They wake up everyday  and park money in rrp because you cant really buy anything else that makes sense. Yields are below rrp and extremely low. If you're a money market fund, you get inflows. Lets say a bill is trading 30bps below rrp at 50bps. So you can go and just invest 80bps at rrp.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nArgument 2 :\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut currently one can argue with another reason why the bill is trading below rrp.\n\nPart of the reason bills are at low yields is because the fed is cutting issuance. Also, we had to sell off stocks and bonds so that money went to cash. Cash for a lot of people is a treasury bill. They are very short term investment. Money that pays interest. So a lot of people are buying that at the same time supply is getting cut. This quarter, Fed will cut 450B following the quarter 150B of treasury bill issuance.\n\nLess supply, more demand pushes yields low and rrp, thereby trading above in yields.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nArgument 3 :\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut there is a a third group of experts that believes this so because of the collateral shortfall. A monetary deflation perhaps, and the time is running out.\n\nAn extra premium for pristine form of pristine form collateral because they wanna buy a treasury bill and take loss rather than lend cash out and take bill as collateral.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3. What impact will Fed and government have on higher than expected tax receipts and lower treasury borrowing schedules on yields with Qt?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs we all know coupon rates have an important effect on the treasury. Since the Fed is about to issue more longer term treasury and also the repo facility can only invest in the shorter term so it feels like the longer term treasury is screwed.\n\nBut it's not that easy. There's a lot of other factor involved beside just supply and demand dynamics. Supply being Treasury, will be issuing more longer term bonds and demand being Fed, will reinvest less of its maturing security and only to shorter term bonds.\n\nLong term bonds are influenced by economic conditions, too. If we are heading into a slowdown, which it does feel like, then the duration of these bonds will start appealing to investors.\n\nAs we head further down the road, the duration will probably catch a bid regardless of increased issue and lack of reinvestment from Fed.\n\nIf inflation remains at 8% till the end of the year, then long term bonds catching a bid will be near certainty.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**4. Will the “Bond bear market” continue?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYes and no.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA : \"Yes\" bond lover guy\n\nBonds will occasionally get a flight-to safety trade. We can already see 10yr rollover from 3.2% to 2.8%\n\n&#x200B;\n\nB : \"No\" bond hater guy\n\nBut the formula for nominal yield = Inflation + growth\n\nSo you don't buy bonds when there is increasing inflation with some room for growth.\n\nAlso, if you have an asset that you created to infinity by printing trillions of dollars, eventually prices will go down.\n\nAnd Fed has started to realize it. Every quarter there is this treasury borrowing advisory committee. They ask the private sector to make a presentation to them about certain things. Most recent one was whether or not trade due to volatility and issuance will be okay for the treasury market. So Fed will be late to solve the problem.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy personal take :\n\nIn the past, Qt has led to bond yields crashing lower because the flight-to safety trade swamped everything. In the beginning period bonds sell off a bit and during the last period they end up more than 100bps lower than they started. But history doesn't repeat it rhymes. So i think market has front-runned the Qt cycle in last 3-4 months.\n\nBut there will be a lot more factors to consider.\n\n\\- Lockdown in china\n\n\\- Ukraine russia war\n\n\\- Global food supply\n\n\\- Other fundamental and commodity factor\n\n\\- Rapid roll over inflation or a little bit less transitory and persistent sticky inflation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**5. In last 2-3yrs size of US treasury market have increased significantly, but treasury repo market has basically not increased much?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[US treasury market up](https://preview.redd.it/f8y90pns30391.png?width=1533&format=png&auto=webp&s=1474c53ead87b2a66e19dbf0413020c38b2bf189)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Rrp market still down](https://preview.redd.it/n0edm59q30391.png?width=1545&format=png&auto=webp&s=dcb1e316792870e25bf65717d240081984ec4144)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLots of investors who buy US treasury securities are not real money investors like pension funds. They are relative value funds. If repo volumes don't pick up, these are like levered non-bank financial institutions who have less room to absorb some of the increased treasury issuance, so this will all put pressure on the repo market if the usa treasury issue gets a bit larger.\n\nWhen the usa issues a treasury, someone has to buy it. There are two parties.\n\nCash buyer : real money , pension fund\n\nLevered buyer : they get money by borrowing in repo market.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**6. 2013-14 recruitment channel of monetary policy by Jeremy Stein**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/stein20130926a.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/stein20130926a.htm)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe way the federal reserve enacts a lot of changes in financial markets are basically not necessarily through direct actions of the federal reserve like raising fed funds rates or 90B dollars of Qt but basically by talking to markets.\n\nSo the market is tightening itself. Its banks starting to back down hatches. Some tech stocks are getting marked down. Bunch of capital having little bit of implosion in MBS selling off. Its like the market is reacting to itself and anticipating things to happen and sort of acting now as opposed to reacting when those changes are actually going to happen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**7. Is Fed going to sell treasury this yr before maturity?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[MBS won't mature and will go down to $15B in 2024, but enough for first 3m i.e. 17.5B\\/m](https://preview.redd.it/2m3ag0tz30391.png?width=1895&format=png&auto=webp&s=35dcb1874465301b90c27af5362f74de55cf52fe)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStarting June 1 till next 3m, Fed max cap of selling securities will be 47.5B/m = 35B/m treasury bonds + 17.5B/m mortgage-backed security.\n\nStarting September 1 till next 3m, Fed max cap of selling securities will be 95B/m = 60B/m treasury bonds + 35B/m mortgage-backed security.\n\nAs interest rate on Mbs rises because of tightening in financial markets and interest rate increases, it has extended the effective duration of Mbs. Mbs is a bit different to treasuries. Basically, you can refinance your house anytime you want. You can also prepay your mortgage, but treasury bonds have a fixed maturity. As rate increases it has affected the portfolio of Mbs. Meaning less of them mature early on than Fed expected. So MBS will be maturing at 20-25B/m as opposed to 35B/m in september.\n\nA lot of discussion is being held that Fed will sell Mbs. This is something Fed hasn't done before. One thing they can do is rather than sell their maturities from its portfolio, they can let them passively mature and run off that way without reinvesting them. They won't actually sell security to the open market.\n\nFed just cannot sell Mbs because of lot of other complications in market. The Mbs the Fed owns right now are basically off the run. So they're issued at lower coupons than the market is currently trading.\n\nMost Fed portfolio is 2-2.5% &\n\nMost market coupon 4-5%\n\nThe market isn't very liquid at the moment if they sell $1T of Mbs.\n\nMbs are special in itself because they are 30yr loan. You can prepay it anytime you want.\n\nEx : 5% mortgage, interest rate went down 3% then i can get new loan to repay old loan.\n\nWhen that happens the yield loan gets paid down and shows up as a prepayment for whoever holds the bond.\n\nBut since we are starting from a low mortgage rate, say 2.5-3.5%. So no prepayment so no one will ever refinance. The only way these bonds will get paid off is through monthly principal + interest payments,, which is a slow process.\n\nHence its all up to Fed to call how Qt will happen for MBS.\n\nMortgage paydowns are proceeding okay until 2024. Then it gets kind of low to about $15B. That's probably slow, but we all know something will blow up when it does happen and then Fed will inject Qe+. So all asset classes will moon once again or we are in a “Great depression”\n\nChart b/w spread b/w mortgage yields and 10yr treasury widened a lot. That's Qt working.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**8. Deep dive on balance sheet capacity?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Banks guidelines](https://preview.redd.it/037k0yu940391.png?width=1261&format=png&auto=webp&s=d8c34995af915a777cea7ab1656d822c2f71e69d)\n\nHere are the terms that you should google and learn more about.\n\nSLR , RWA , differential accounting guidelines, diff b/w notable and non notable transactions, VAR limit, haircuts, collateral velocity, IM VM requirement etc.\n\nThese all influence ability of financial institutions to construct their balance sheet and conduct financial transaction.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*Warning\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* : This sh9t will f@#k you up. Don’t read. It’s just a rant.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBasel 3 in brief :\n\n[https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d424\\_inbrief.pdf](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d424_inbrief.pdf)\n\n[https://www.bis.org/fsi/fsisummaries/b3\\_lrf.pdf](https://www.bis.org/fsi/fsisummaries/b3_lrf.pdf)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSLR (Supplementary leverage ratio) : In the USA it its a part of Basel III tier 1 guidelines with which banks calculate the amount of common equity capital they must hold relative to their total leverage exposure. Large US banks must hold 3%.\n\nThere's a two set of guidelines that are supposed to be governing how banks construct their balance sheets one is SLR, a risk-asset-neutral leverage ratio. So basically it just governs how leveraged overall banks could be.\n\nOne of the most important changes to basel III as compared to earlier versions of basel is that this is gonna be a non-risk-weighed measure, which means it also captures all sorts of activities, right. So it captures things like over-the-counter, off balance sheet like derivatives, as well as sort of balance sheet activities like repo.\n\nFed's intention is to regulate SLR to be a binding constraint on the balance sheet. It's supposed to be more like a backstop.\n\nIt then engages banks to be a different kind of behavior. A couple of years ago we got a new novel marketing invention right before the time of the repo blow that may have facilitated the repo blow-up in 2019. It was called \"Sponsored Repo\" born out of frustration or response to a lot of these balance sheet restrictions.\n\nThe problem : For normal repo transactions they count, so $1 of repo counts $1 against your assets for SLR. This leads to a problem where repo is relatively historically been a high volume but low spread business.\n\nSo now you have an SLR that basically gives you a fixed limit of how much asset you can own on the balance sheet. You don't want to do these high volume, low spread businesses. You want to do low volume, high spread business.\n\nThis basically incentivizes banks on margin to get out of traditional repo and into sponsored repo or into activities that have more favourable accounting treatment like FI swaps. These are similar to repo transactions. Its basically a collaterized loan by another currency. But FI swaps have favourable accounting compared to repo transactions. This basically leads to situations where banks have to choose b/w various kinds of activities. They are more likely to choose activities that have more favourable accounting treatment.\n\nSo this all leads to basically all sorts of problems where you have incentives which are not necessarily economic in nature. You have sort of regulatory incentives in the past, Basel 1 and 2 where you loan your $100 of mortgage to a subprime borrower where there's a $100 of mortgage on your balance sheet. If package this into MBS then its diversified and accounts only 50%. If you pair this with CDS then this accounts for only 20% against risk-weighted assets ( RWA)\n\nSo basically as a result of how these guidelines are stretched, you can have 5x more exposure essentially through different types of instrument. We can talk about whether this is justified or not because to some extent you know if you have CDS on subprime Mbs, it is safer than holding just subprime loans. So it all depends on what type of assets banks want to hold.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow lets talk about the underrated driving force. The money multiplier.\n\nIts a ratio of monetary base to amount of loans or deposits.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/page1-econ/2021/09/17/teaching-the-linkage-between-banks-and-the-fed-r-i-p-money-multiplier#:\\~:text=Money%20multiplier%20%3D%201%20%2F%20RR%2C,ratio%20set%20by%20the%20Fed.](https://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/page1-econ/2021/09/17/teaching-the-linkage-between-banks-and-the-fed-r-i-p-money-multiplier#:~:text=Money%20multiplier%20%3D%201%20%2F%20RR%2C,ratio%20set%20by%20the%20Fed.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nInvisible money multiplier :\n\nAs these haircuts, collateral velocity or how SLR governs the counting treatment of different types of assets that base could hold. It changes the invisible money multiplier on different types of assets on how much banks can lever up on these assets, & it changes the structure and the favourable accounting treatment for different types of assets in financial systems.\n\nMeaning banks can add hundreds of dollars of long term-duration Treasury bonds viewed as risk-off hedges to their balance sheet & it has nothing to do with deflation or depression coming. It could basically be due to a change in the SLR exemption ratio.\n\nA lot of banks have to deal with regulatory concerns. Ex : Banks make loan to business. There are going to be capital changes under regulation that add to the cost that a bank incurs. But if banks were to buy the treasury, there'd be no capital changes. So there is leverage ratio but no risk-based measure so it could be cheaper for them to buy treasury and so that could be their part of consideration.\n\nNot to mention, but they have a whole bunch of liquidity regulation. They kind of have to buy liquid assets like treasuries or cheap reserves. for ex : They could be holding on to these assets simply due to huge optimization problems.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSummary :  Regulation plays an important role in what banks can do or not. So we should not read into anything macro what they are doing with their asset book.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**9. We keep hearing \"Banks dont need reserves to make loan\" so why does it matter if the quality of reserves in the system decreases? Reserves are mostly in excess nowadays no?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Balance sheet of Banks](https://preview.redd.it/rltkfbxk40391.png?width=1836&format=png&auto=webp&s=7516e905077e516f42da07c366d40c816b877743)\n\nReserve requirements were eliminated in March April 2020. Whatever reserve requirements used to be, they don't exist anymore.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2011/wp11256.pdf](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2011/wp11256.pdf)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere was a research paper which called for some alternative monetary facts. They talk about this myth that money multipliers banks need reserves to make loans. They provide that in 2007 JPM had 0.1% of its its assets in actual reserves. Banks needed to have 10% at that time.\n\nBanks need reserves in order to settle transactions with each other. They don't need reserves to make loans in the first place. But if deposits that are created by those loans were to be transferred to another bank, then they would need reserves to settle with that bank. So they would transfer deposit + reserves. So basically these reserves are lent to subtle transaction b/w banks. They are used to lend in both the repo and FX markets. So banks need reserves to settle inter bank transactions by both buying and selling as well as lending and borrowing. But they are not necessary to make loan.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**10. Concept of money**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBasic :\n\n[https://open.lib.umn.edu/principleseconomics/chapter/24-1-what-is-money/](https://open.lib.umn.edu/principleseconomics/chapter/24-1-what-is-money/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFed made rule : Treasuries would not count as assets and then banks loaded up on treasuries and people were like banks are betting on depression. Basically, they were giving free amounts of leverage to hold. Leverage is defined as assets/equity.\n\nFX swaps & interest swaps are money in some sense because these when you combine with loan and security, might allow you to hold more of these loan and securities, which basically allows you to have more purchasing power over these kind of assets.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nValue at risk :\n\nWhat kind of assets banks can hold. A certain type of risk measure which Hfs and different types of financial institutions use that basically tells them how volatile an asset is historically or with 30D look back period. Basically, how much velocity is acceptable for that asset.\n\nEx $100M portfolio of security at 10%. The max amount you should lose is 10% if the historical distribution holds.\n\nSo if $200M then its 5%\n\n$400M then 2.5%\n\n$1B then 1% mark.\n\nA lot of these concepts are fungible. In all, money isn't bank deposits or reserves.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBalance sheet capacity :\n\n1 unit of balance sheet space, however you define it to be, allows you to take 1 unit of additional risk exposure or 1 unit of additional purchasing power.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**11. Volatility and its impacts on bonds+stock market**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf volatility goes up, many things become less money-like.\n\nIf volatility is low, you can trade your assets for bank deposits or something else.\n\nIf volatility is high + no liquidity then you will not be able to easily convert your assets into bank deposits.\n\nThere was an unprecedented volatility in US treasury market during march 2020.  We saw huge bids from treasuries and sell-offs. Hf's basis trade blowing up. You also had foreign institutions trying to sell treasuries and get into cash, but the US treasury market became frozen and unusable for a period of several days. This was not supposed to happen and be the most liquid market in the world.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere was a blog post in NY: Fed.\n\n[https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2020/04/treasury-market-liquidity-during-the-covid-19-crisis/](https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2020/04/treasury-market-liquidity-during-the-covid-19-crisis/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey looked at dealer under SLR. During March 2020 they didn't behave differently, but the commentary is that it wasn't that they were bound by SLR except because volatility was too high.\n\njust to protect themselves, dealers weren't able to prepare the market as they used to. If there is a wide bid ask spread treasuries are moving a lot, you dont know what the right price is. So you don't want to warehouse risk. So you pull back market activity and hence people can't sell.\n\nHence, treasuries became less money-like.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nVIX at 16 with leverage 4x ( S&P moves 1% in a day ) = VIX at 64 ( S&P moves 4% in a day )\n\nVolatility is high derisk, whereas low volatility means lever up and go crazy.\n\nIn 2020, no one could sell treasury when people wanted to basis harvesting by buying cash treasury and selling in futures. The spread kept widening before it converged. Hence, people were forced to add more collateral and eat losses.\n\nSince 2008, the equity of banks is still growing, but their assets have actually declined because of restrictions in balance sheet capacity.\n\nHigh volume with less tolerance for risk led to the collapse of leverage in the financial system.\n\nHence we wont drain $3T from balance sheet. Something is bound to break before that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt last i will throw in charts of Fed rate projection and housing market. Be careful while analyzing them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Fed rate projection](https://preview.redd.it/a4lhz4dw40391.png?width=1902&format=png&auto=webp&s=9abef72cfdb1fdbaa6ad6e42b5d91433c6b76430)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[How bad housing is.](https://preview.redd.it/9qvcqp9z40391.png?width=1207&format=png&auto=webp&s=8bee9c2088af18edeba4817440e155b19dc8e9f1)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.s.
