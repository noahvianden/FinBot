I think it’s likely you see 10% discounts going forward but I don’t see any reason or evidence to see it getting as bad as the 2008 crash since there’s no reason we would see as many foreclosures unless we get into stagflation territory where unemployment gets bad.\n\nAnd either way, as the article makes very clear, the higher end of the housing market is basically unaffected because owners can afford to wait out economic downturns.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "No. I’m saying foreclosures and a mortgage market based on overvalued homes which people couldn’t actually afford in the first place is what led to the ballooning 30% number but it didn’t happen in every city, particularly the PNW was extremely resistant to the housing crash.\n\nAnd no, valuations aren’t up any ridiculous amount because there is a housing shortage everywhere and qualifying for a mortgage is much more difficult than in 2008 so there won’t be as many foreclosures without unemployment getting bad (in which case everyone will be screwed because that means stagflation).\n\nI can read between the lines and tell that you have hopium there will be a housing crash with massive discounts so you can get a home. If you’re looking in unattractive, poorer areas and have all cash you can probably find someone who gets desperate and get your discount.
