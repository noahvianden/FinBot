Everyone else *intentionally* moved to modular platforms because modular platforms present an innovative shared cost structure across a diverse set of models to do exactly what you describe.\n\nThe idea is that rather than building millions of the same car, you build multiple differentiated cars with similar underpinnings and a diluted R&D cost.\n\nIt *isn't a flub* when GM only builds a few thousand Hummer EVs — *and I think this is what confuses people*. It's a limited public release — a beta, if you will — of a generalizable platform which will indeed extend to millions of vehicles. It is *intentionally* the same abstracted design underneath as the Silverado EV, and GMC Sierra, and will eventually be the same as the future Tahoe, Suburban, Yukon, and Escalade.\n\nAll that money is in the platform, not the individual vehicle — because in the grand scheme of things, throwing money at an *abstraction* of a vehicle (which you can then [stamp out in different versions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_Group_MQB_platform)) makes way more sense than throwing money at a single vehicle itself.\n\nTo borrow a phrase: *Platforms are the machine which allows you to build machines which build machines.*\n\nHere's the thing: Tesla too, will need to do this to expand to 20M. The Model 3 and Model Y are a *nascent* version of this, but they're not generalizable in current form, because they aren't expressly modular. The TMY is, for all intents and purposes, simply a hiked up TM3.. which is fine, but the minute you need to change something fundamental and make a differentiable offering.. well, that means building something wholly new and bespoke.\n\nSo platform-based development is the *inevitable* conclusion we are speedrunning towards, and the end result will be something a lot more similar to Ford's lineup — because if you have a Bronco Sport, it's a [negligible proposition to throw a Maverick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_C2_platform) towards your customers, too.\n\nThe real meaty argument here is that some automakers have gone too far.
