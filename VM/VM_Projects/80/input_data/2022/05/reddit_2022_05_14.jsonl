I stopped trading options almost entirely now for 2 years and trade forex. I study charts and trade probably more often then majority of traders here since if you trading lower then 25k you when to respect pdt. Those trading larger accounts still do not usually place near the amount of trades a forex scalper does. Generally speaking it is the most liquid market and tradable 247 with binary options even. So I have a small amount of experience to shed light on. In forex percentage risk is so important and entirely a game changer. Because it’s leverage trading and far greater then robinhood since options is a set risk. I’ve become a mad man to evaluate percentage risk as I trade prop firms. For the records and you don’t have to take my words for this but my chart skills have gotten very good because of all the hours I’ve put in.

Sometimes you didn't have all the information when you initially formed it. Sometimes the overall situation will change. Sometimes you will just have been flat out wrong.\n\n5 - When you realize what you're holding isn't actually worth its price, sell it. Don't rely on hope/greed that it could be more expensive tomorrow. Your profit/loss in the trade should not be a consideration. \n\n5a - The only semi-exception is taxes/min length of holding requirements. This is actually the sort of thing options are supposed to be used for - you can use them to protect yourself while waiting a bit longer for long-term gains tax rates to kick in.\n\n6 - Options buyers typically lose money. That's OK if they're being used as insurance to protect a much larger amount of money. Otherwise it's better to be a seller of options rather than a buyer.\n\n7 - When you fail to follow your rules, but make money on the trade anyway, it's still bad. When you follow your rules and lose money, you still did the right thing.
