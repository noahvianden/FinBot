And that similarity is a large percentage of people misunderstanding the company.\r  \n\r  \nFor a long time with Tesla, people would say stuff like \"it is just a car company\" and \"the competition is coming and then it is over for Tesla\". Those people didn't understand Tesla, but as more people started to understand Tesla, the stock experienced tremendous gains.\r  \n\r  \nNow, whenever I see Roku stock get brought up, I see similar kinds of misunderstandings.\r  \n\r  \nMany people misunderstand Roku's business thinking that they are just a hardware seller, but they are much more than that. Roku is selling the shovels to the streaming gold rush. Every streaming service has to give Roku a cut of their subscription revenue just to be on their platform. So, as the overall streaming industry grows bigger which it will, it doesn't matter which individual service is the leader since Roku will be collecting a cut of the revenue from all of them. In addition, Roku has a great ad business, and they collect tons of data about customer preferences across all of the streaming services and that data is very valuable to advertisers. It is also valuable for use internally to help them deliver the content that people want as they grow their own streaming service into yet another source of revenue.\r  \n\r  \nRoku also gets the competition fears with people thinking that Apple, Google, and Amazon are going to hurt Roku. It is like people think that this competition is new. But, in fact; Apple, Google, and Amazon have been competition for Roku for many, many years (Google and Amazon since about 2014, and Apple since 2007 before Roku was even released). Yet Roku continues to beat them in owning the most market share year after year after year with no signs of that changing.\r  \n\r  \nI don't always agree with everything that Cathie buys (I don't believe in her 3rd largest holding for example), but I'm with her on this one. I'm very bullish on Roku at these current prices and I think that it has the potential to be a ten-bagger over the next decade.", "score": 20, "replies": [{"body": "Teladoc is also the new Amazon", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "I heard Jim Cramer say that more than once.

{"title": "Abercrombie and Fitch ($ANF) Earnings Report (05/24 PM)", "selftext": "So many earnings reports coming up with the market exploding feels like soooo many good opportunities are just not being discussed. This is a community of over 10 million people and I can't find any DD about any upcoming earnings reports during a HISTORIC market crash. They fricken turned off the free money and it seems like everything is dropping back down to COVID levels. Feels like free puts all around but nobody is calling out any plays. I wanna just present information and create a discussion about specific companies that I think could be a good investment opportunity. On this post I will talk about $ANF.\n\nI think with Abercrombie and Fitch there could be a good possibility to make some money. With their earnings report being pre-market Tuesday (05/24), there is still a chance to get in on some puts if the market continues to tank come Monday.\n\nPretty much everything lately has been tanking right, pretty obvious to see. Seems like everything is returning back to at least covid levels (just take a look at the NFLX/TGT/ROST charts).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[5-year $ANF](https://preview.redd.it/x1w801573s091.png?width=535&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e3fd745eb8cd8a0dae9b2d50d585393f28e192e)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[1-month $ANF](https://preview.redd.it/sldesjx93s091.png?width=549&format=png&auto=webp&s=085e069ab11424e5487499d247bf7809e3dd3cac)\n\nI want to go over $ANF and why I think there are two different ways to make money off of their upcoming earnings report. First, just by taking a look at the charts, one can see from the 5-year chart that this thing has still got a ways to go before getting back to pre-covid levels. There is no way anybody in the world could convince me that Abercrombie and Fitch are doing better right now than they were back before covid, especially given all the . The 1-month chart also shows that this thing is clearly in a downward trend. Shit even looks like it bounced recently on the 1-month chart for some reason...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Fidelity Pro Options Distribution](https://preview.redd.it/9zlvnjvw3s091.png?width=648&format=png&auto=webp&s=270a93b90ee4429226043c1e28007227172828d1)\n\nAs of market close on Friday (05/20) this was the current call/put ratio for $ANF. It is clearing showing that currently the market is betting on this thing tanking, and lets be honest... everything is dropping right now. However, this also does show that the 52 Wk IV30 is at an all time high so if you are holding options through earnings and there isnt enough volatility, you will get IV crushed. That said, there are still ways to make money from this.\n\nSo, from the 5-year chart one can see that this ticker used to sit around the $15 - $20 range pre-covid and meanwhile it closed at $27.97 like, just look at what just happened to Target...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[5-year chart ](https://preview.redd.it/ildb6ot07s091.png?width=1410&format=png&auto=webp&s=76d4b81092e568cc92b6bfec4b695726388b614b)\n\nAll retail stuff is going to be experiencing the same stuff... just look at Walmart and Ross recently. Supply chain issues off the ass, plus is the world really better now than it was back before covid? The money printer got turned off and the market is getting completely flipped over. The old rules don't apply anymore. I think there are tons of different opportunities coming up and I just wanted to present information and get a discussion going.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Options prices next two weeks](https://preview.redd.it/afjs7bhg6s091.png?width=1203&format=png&auto=webp&s=a8fe2fd44691f780865e6ac67b30cccc2d530f76)\n\nThe options/FDs aren't horribly expensive. Could be a good possible day trade if you don't want to hold through earnings if you buy early Monday morning and sell late into the day as the IV rises to lock in some profit or if you wanna gamble with some runners, go for it.\n\nFuck whatever the fuck the analysts are saying. I feel like this is a good opportunity for some puts and I would like to hear come counter arguments! I have no emotional attachment to this stock, I just want to make money from it so please don't attack me haha I am just trying to start a discussion.

They like to sit around a 1:1 cash to debt ratio, even after repurchasing 10.2 million shares in 2021 at prices above where they are right now. They have dramatically increased their margins and IMO are ahead of inflation by consolidating their store count and embracing omni-channeling which has reduced overhead costs. They are even looking to open more stores this year, which sounds absurd until you look into the economics of how they operate them as hubs for their online distribution (think GameStop but better margins). They should sit at a 7-8% operating margin this year even with inflation which would still be better than pre-covid operations.. \n\nI know that retail is getting beat up but there are FAR worse companies than $ANF to bet against.
