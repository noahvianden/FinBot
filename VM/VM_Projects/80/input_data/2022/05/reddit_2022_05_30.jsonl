Tesla is achieving margins people thought were impossible in the automotive industry (30%+ gross, en route to 40%), with unprecedented demand, and massively improving cash flows quarterly. \n\nNot to mention the majority of TSLA longs are not banking on the cars being the end game, but a means to the renewable/AI end-game. Modern markets evaluate the TAM of these companies and apply a multiplier for likelihood of capitalizing that TAM. (This market concept is nothing new, but explained thoroughly and beautifully in Peter Thiel's Zero to One.)\n\nThe three combined TAM is \"$/mi driven\" for the robotaxi theory, \"$/kwh\" on the energy grid theory, and $ per labour unit on the moonshot AI-Robot theory. Collectively this could be a multi-trillion opportunity, but most people will scoff at it.

Right now they basically are the EV market and a luxury good, so they have massive pricing power, I agree. \n\nThat said every other theory is pretty much entirely unproven. The robotaxis fleet is running on pure hopium. There‚Äôs no reason to believe tsla will even be the first to true fsd bc we don‚Äôt know which tech will get there first. Their solar is a failing business and their Robot is a man dressed in a robot suite.

The multiplier can be 0.01 (unlikely) or 0.5 or 0.99 (imminent.) \n\nIf it was certain then it would be baked into the price, and that's called hindsight investing and is the sure-fire way to average returns. \n\n\"Competition will destroy margins/moat/etc.\" has been a bear thesis since 2013 and we still haven't seen it. Not saying it won't happen (it's capitalism -- enemies always chip away at market share), but I'd say it requires more *hopium* to assume FCA/Toyota/VW et al to produce comparable EVs at anywhere-near-comparable-margins, navigating the Innovators Dilemma, and being dragged down by technological debt + infrastructure debt + dividend obligations. \n\nIt will take billions upon billions, cutting off gangrene, and ridiculous execution to compete with Tesla *today*, all while Tesla still moves at the speed of light towards the end-game of an energy utility. \n\nThe cars are a means to the end, so we get in line now -- and that's why the big vision bears are going to be at 500B or 1TN market cap. Same reason I was leveraging my house to buy *Amazon: The book company* or *Netflix: The video streaming website*.

You say it‚Äôs been a bear thesis since 2013 like that‚Äôs relevant. Elon has been promising full fsd since forever too. But there are two realities: 1. Tesla will not be the only EV so competition is imminent and 2. It‚Äôs totally unclear that Tesla can deliver robotaxis, robots, or apparently even profitable solar. \n\nThe competition does not have to come from legacy car makers either. So that‚Äôs not really a counter argument. I agree competition in the luxury space is going to be hard to come by but if you‚Äôre talking the eV TAM most people would just buy an EV ie tesla less the software.
