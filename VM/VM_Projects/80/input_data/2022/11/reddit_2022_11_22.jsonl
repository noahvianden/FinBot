The stock has also been boosted by the pre-2022 bull market, its admission to the S&P, low interest rates, FOMO, and Musk’s aura.\n\nBut now the S&P index is down over 20% and will likely lose another 20% if we enter a recession and/or if interest rates rise. That will tend to drag TSLA down. Rising interest rates make growth stocks particularly unattractive to sophisticated investors.\n\nFOMO is fading as the stock’s price loses its momentum and establishes a year-long downtrend of 50%. Trends tend to continue—the basic truth of technical analysis.\n\nTesla’s first-mover advantage will last for maybe another year, but as its growth rate slows investors will value it less highly. Its competition, which is supported by its ICE profits, can sell BEVs at a loss and cut Tesla’s margins. Some competitors have already beaten Tesla on quality but haven’t yet ramped up their quantity.\n\nTesla is facing regulatory pressure and costly lawsuits, including reputational cost, especially if it loses California’s racism suit.\n\nTesla’s big bets on FSD and a full-featured 4680 battery (and with it the Semi, Cybertruck, and Roadster) are fizzling—a fizzle that hasn’t yet been recognized in the SP. CATL will be supplying all comers in 8 months with a battery superior even to a full-featured 4680.\n\nAn impending shortage and consequent high price of battery materials will make HEVs and PHEVs, especially Toyota’s newly improved versions, powerful diagonal competitors with BEVs.\n\nTesla is canceling orders for its roof tiles and may be exiting that market. Its solar panel business is small and has little promise. Toyota and Lucid have come out with Powerwall competition that looks at least as good as Tesla’s. Tesla’s big power storage units are doing OK, but competition in that market will keep profits down.\n\nI suspect Musk will have to sell a big batch of his TSLA stake due to the Twitter situation, depressing the SP.\n\nThe above is how the big picture looks to me—a perfect storm.
