Every newspaper, every News Channel was talking about the subprime mortgage collapse and there was a lot of uncertainty on the street. I knew this guy from college and later found out he was one of our clients. He calls me and ask of what is happening, he was an engineer with a car manufacturer who had just lost his job and his wife was a homemaker. I told him about the situation and told him not to panic. He had been a good saver over the years and had put together a nice nest egg which on an average day was worth around 800k but b/c of the situation it was around 430K. His money was in couple different funds.  I told him to only withdraw what he needs to survive the next 6 months as his house was already payed off. I said get any job even a minimum wage job, just keep money coming in, keep applying to jobs where you can use your degree (engineering gig) But whatever you do, do not sell anything more than what he needs for a few months. Me and him got into an argument about \"not selling\". I told him that even if it all goes to 200k, tommorow is another day and that he should have confidence in American businesses over a long period of time, I told him that Bear market over corrects in situations like this and not only he should not be selling if anything he should be buying more b/c the valuations were crazy cheap. He said it was ppl like me that was the problem, He called me a \"wall street scumbag\". Not surprisingly he did not take my advise and sold everything.\n\nI saw him today and he was the one that brought up the call and he apologized he said that according to his calculations if he had just left his account alone he would have had more than 1.4 million today.
