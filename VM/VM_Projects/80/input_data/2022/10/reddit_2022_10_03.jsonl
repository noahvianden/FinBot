{"title": "My Bear Thesis", "selftext": "I have been investing for over a decade and I have not seen anything like the past two and a half years. \n\nAs 2019 came to a close we were seeing a general softening of the market and than COVID-19 hit and central banks around world started with the most accommodating fiscal and monetary policy in history. Interest rates dropped to essentially 0 and everyone got a free money like an Opera talk show. We saw the fastest and strongest bull run and shortest recession in history. It created crypto and meme millionaires commodities sky rocketed like lumber, copper, lithium, rare earth metals etc. housing prices increase by 50-100 percent in most market in North America we had one of the largest drops in labor force participation and turnover. \n\nIn 2022 this all changed as our fearless central bank leaders ignored the ramped run up of assets and impacts of free money for all polices as just a transitory hiccup not to worry about  to only see one the largest increases inflation since the 70s. This of course led to the \"o faaak\" moment where they decided to raise rates quickly to avoid hyperinflation and so free money ended, eviction moratorium were lifted and the most aggressive tightening cycle in history \"The Big Squeeze\" has begun.\n\nToday we continue to see a tight labour market, a rising USD, an energy dislocation, rising costs of almost all things including debt and a high interest environment that hasn't been fully priced in nor adjusted to which is leading to business and consumers being squeezed and a high degree of volatility in financial markets. \n\nWe are seeing one the largest periods of personal savings evaporate and consumer debt starting to rise as the global synchronized tightening cycle  continues with promises of increase unemployment and pain. In many markets we have seen the impact working it's way through the real estate market, reduction in real consumption and disorder in financial markets as a result from USD aggressive apperction. \n\n1. As unemployment ticks up, household debt to increase and  real estate price declines will accelerate. \n\nTypically people will hold on to their homes until the bitter end But with rising rates, food bills, car payments, declining real wages and loss of an income earner many house holds will reduce consumer discretionary purchases, end leases or financing on second cars and increase the use of credit before having to sell their house. \n\nWe have already seen big declines in consumer discretionary items and we are likely to see used cars and auto related stocks see drying up demand as a precursor to accelerated real estate declines. \n\nShort Consumer Discretionary ETFs \n\nLeap PUTs on auto traders / manufactures with high valuations, low margin of safety and operating margins of less than 30%. (2022 Q4-2023-Q1)\n\nShort US Real estate - decline have started in many states in the US but more advanced in NZ, AUD, CAN, UK.  (2023)\n\nBullish - Agriculture, discount grocers, fertilizer, oil consumer staples, utilities. \n\nEU energy Crisis and War in Ukraine \n\nHigher prices for energy at multiples of other regions will have an outsize impact on manufacturing and will lead to a recession in Q4 2022. \n\nShort EU equities (EPV)\n\nBullish - LNG exporters, Uranium, Defense companies, USD.\n\n\nConsumer Debt crisis - moderate to high probability with declining real estate equity and increases unemployment/ debt.(DRV)\n\nFinancial crisis- increasing probability with liquidity reductions over 2022-23.\n\nSovereign debt crises - increasing probability in emerging markets and is occuring in some countries already.\n\nWe are entering a period of higher uncertainty and volatility (UVXY) equities and bonds have both underperformed over the last 6-9 months with the USD being the safe haven has appreciated greatly. It is likely we will see a continuation of this trend as assets and consumption continue to decline and the accumulative impact of a high rate environment over longer duration has an outsize impact on the consumers, companies with larger debt loads and lower operating margins and countries that are import dependent with declining currencies. \n\nWhile a pivot is possible it will likely be short lived as cash inflows into equities and commodities will likely re spark inflation which policy markers are trying to avoid as history of the 1970s pivot has been closely examined.\n\nIt is more likely that monetary policy will only be used as last resort to prop up asset prices when they breach well below March 2020 lows to stem off deflation as the war against inflation is declared over at least in the short term.\n\nDo you agree ?

Executives told the Financial Times that markets barely dodged a Lehman-Brothers-like collapse – but this time with your mum’s pension at the centre of the drama.\n\nProblems with “pension plumbing” are what caused the mess. The culprit is said to be a popular pension strategy called liability-driven investing, or LDI.\n\nLeverage is a key element of many LDI strategies, and are basically a way pension funds can look like they’re an annuity without making the full capital commitment of becoming one. As the drama unfolded we talked to some analysts and pensions managers who weren’t directly involved with the UK meltdown, but are experts in LDI and liability-matching practices. Here’s a summary of what they told us:\n\n\n**What on earth happened this week?**\n\nIn short, gilt yields soared. That forced UK pensions to sell gilts. That pushed gilt prices even lower and yields even higher, which forced UK pensions to sell more gilts (and other liquid assets), and so on. The Bank of England intervened to stop the spiral. See the chart below:\n\n\n**That looks bad. And now I have more questions than I started with. Why did UK gilt yields soar in the first place?**\n\nIt was indeed bad. The benchmark 30-year gilt yield spiked 1.2 percentage points in just three days, a massive move.\n\nYields have been climbing for a while, but the latest extreme jump happened because chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng’s mini-budget was an homage to Harry Styles’s Don’t Worry Darling performance — a foreseeable disaster with a poorly hidden British accent.\n\n**That doesn’t explain why UK pensions were forced to sell.**\n\n\nYes, that’s the key question here!\n\nThe dumbest explanation is that pensions had to sell gilts because gilts are easy to sell. Pensions also sold other liquid assets, like mortgages and high-grade corporate credit, for the same reason. They needed to raise cash.\n\n**What did they need the cash for?**\n\nWell, the cruel irony is that pensions needed collateral for margin calls on leveraged trades hedging against big moves in . . . UK government bond yields.\n\nSo pensions sold bonds (among other things) to raise that cash, pushing yields up, making hedging trades even more expensive, and requiring even more collateral.\n\nIf the BoE hadn’t stepped in to arrest the declines, pensions may have defaulted on those contracts, which would have been very bad. That isn’t the same thing as going bust – it’s not like all the investments disappear overnight – but it does risk tying up the pension in a knotty legal fight over settling the default.\n\nAs Toby Nangle pointed out on Wednesday, The Pensions Regulator said in 2019 that 62 per cent of the biggest UK pensions had at least some exposure to interest-rate swaps, a type of derivative . . . \n\n**Derivatives! Didn’t Warren Buffett call those “weapons of mass financial destruction”?**\n\n[Heavy sigh] Yes, he did.\n\nBut interest-rate hedging with swaps is a pretty vanilla type of derivative use, all things considered. Pensions used everything from equity options to single-name credit default swaps, according to The Pensions Regulator’s 2019 survey. Interest-rate swaps are used widely among the large US and UK investors who want to match their assets with liabilities; think pension funds and insurers.\n\nIn fact, the basic concept of “liability-driven investing,” or LDI, just means planning your investments’ cash payouts to your future cash needs. In a simple world, you wouldn’t need derivatives to do this at all. Pensions would simply buy bonds that would pay out what they need to pay pensioners, when they need to pay pensioners. Need a lump-sum payment in the future? Buy a zero-coupon bond that matures on that date! Easy.\n\n**We don’t live in a simple world, though.**\n\nExactly, and that’s where things get messy. Until a pension plan is fully funded and frozen (meaning it has no new participants or benefits), there isn’t any way to know for sure what its liabilities will be in the future. That means pension funds need to take extra risk. There is an entire industry built to tell them how to take this risk, and there are many different options, like private equity, hedge-fund strategies, and notoriously, the rare kickback scheme.\n\nGenerally, when a pension starts putting money into liability-driven investment strategies, it means that it isn’t interested in continuing to watch its pension’s funding ratio swing around with the market.\n\nPensions generally don’t put all their money into LDI strategies at once. Beyond the uncertainty around what they will owe, many are underfunded, meaning they need to put cash into riskier assets to earn a return and make up for that difference.\n\nBut even when they need to put cash into stocks or other risky markets, they can use leverage (swaps, repo, etc) to match their entire investment portfolio’s duration with the duration of their liabilities.\n\nIn this scenario, with well-functioning swap hedges in place, the current value/cost of all of a pension’s liabilities declines in a bond-market sell-off. At risk of oversimplification, that means that equities can fall, but if they decline less than the bond market, the pension’s funding status can actually improve.\n\nThat is probably a large part of the reason that pensions of the 100 biggest US companies were actually more than fully funded as of August 31, according to consultancy Millman, which estimated that assets totalled 106 per cent of liabilities.\n\n**Hold on. LDI is based on a quant-y accounting gimmick?**\n\nWe can’t say the concept itself is a gimmick — again, the entire insurance business is pretty much built to match assets with expected liabilities. Barring widespread defaults, bonds do have a predictable stream of cash flows.\n\nSo in a perfect quantworld, a pension would own a risk-free government bond that pays what it owes a retiree, on the day it owes it to them. Then who cares if the price of the bond goes down today? They’re holding it to maturity. And even here on earth, a company that freezes its defined-benefit plan can then offload its (matched) liabilities to a life insurer who can perform insurance magick (maths) to ensure the payouts happen (for a fee). Works well, right?\n\n**But adding interest-rate swaps to the mix sounds like a way to pretend you have that bond portfolio without actually putting up the capital to invest in a bond. (Or forgoing the potential equity returns.)**\n\nYes! It does seem a bit like some quants decided to build a better pension-management mousetrap, doesn’t it? And whenever there is a way to sell questionably structured derivatives to pensions or other “real money” investors, there’s almost always a Wall Street counterparty eager to make the trade.\n\n**Like who?**\n\nIf you think you might know, please do get in contact.\n\n**So now they’ve blown up. What does that mean for the rest of us?**\n\nStay on the lookout for more deleveraging outside of the gilts market. In the US, investment-grade corporate debt and agency mortgage-backed securities should be an area of focus, since, like gilts, they are fairly liquid and easy to sell.\n\nFor its part, the investment-grade ICE Corporate Bond Index lost 2.2 per cent between Friday Sept. 23 and Tuesday Sept. 27, underperforming benchmark Treasuries; that compares to a 1.5-per-cent loss over the entire prior week, when the Fed raised rates by 75 basis points and took an unexpectedly hawkish stance.\n\n**We know LDI strategies are popular in the US too. What’s to stop something like the UK blow-up from happening there?**\n\nA couple of experts who help build LDI strategies for US pensions told us that US companies tend to use less leverage than their UK peers.\n\nBut it is difficult to find concrete data backing that up, because companies don’t need to report their pension plans’ leverage or swap exposure in their SEC filings. And given the general attitude that is likely to surround LDI for some time, we aren’t especially eager to accept that at face value. Millman loosely gauges LDI participation by pensions’ allocations to the bond market: Its latest annual pension-funding study found that their fixed-income allocation had climbed to 51 per cent by year-end 2021, up from 42 per cent in 2008.\n\nStill, it isn’t clear that a comparable disaster is destined to occur in the US, even if the country’s pensions were similarly levered. Remember, the main cause of the mess was a gilt sell-off that was extremely fast and violent, prompted by a major panic over a mini budget.\n\n\n\nhttps://www.ft.com/content/f4a728a5-0179-48bd-b292-f48e30f8603c\n\nhttps://archive.ph/pA3eH", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for this brother.

You are hired by an employer to flip burgers. Employer pays you $15 an hour and you are able to flip 16 burgers at $1 profit to the employer each. Your employer made $16, paid you $15 and kept $1 for himself. You both made a profit.\n\n2. **Negative Sum Game**: Adding Person A and B net change is negative. Not necessarily that both are negative, usually one is positive, but the other is far more negative.\n\nExample: Jones Act. The American Shipbuilders lobby politicians to require ships going from one American Port to a second American port must be American ships with American employees. There's only a few of these companies. They make massive profit.\n\nBut, the American consumer has a massive loss, because it's economically inefficient to have a ship go from China to LA and then unload some of it into a second ship to go from LA to Hawaii. But, it's illegal under Jones Act for the ship to go from China to Hawaii to drop off some of their goods and then to LA to drop off the rest. Because a Chinese ship can't legally go from Hawaii to LA. So Hawaiians have to pay far more for their goods, than if the Jones act didn't exist.\n\nNegative Sum Game because for the American Ship Builders to make $100M profit, the island of Hawaii has to spend an extra $120M on stuff they buy due to the extra waste of time of sending a second ship.\n\nNegative Sum games are usually not found in free markets because the participants wouldn't willingly engage in them. We only see them when lobbyists representing special interest groups can bribe, I mean donate to politicians to make the economy less productive to extract money from a larger number of people in small amounts each, so they don't notice.\n\n3. **Zero Sum Game**: Adding Person A and B together equals zero.

This particular portfolio has around $150k in it total.\n\nI am about $100k in Gold and then oscillate the other $50k into a variety of things including TSLA puts.\n\nSo about a month ago, I had $10k TSLA Puts, and $140k of various stocks.\n\nTSLA went up 5%, and my puts went down 20% as is common. Because of the nature of options, they are leveraged.\n\nI did not want to sell any of the other $140k of stocks I held to re-balance into TSLA puts, so I shorted $5k of TSLA.\n\nA short is a pure linear play. If TSLA goes up 5%, I lose 5% in my short. If TSLA goes down 10% I gain 10% in my short. Compared to Puts that have exponential movements. If TSLA goes up 5% the put might go down 20%.\n\nThe benefit of using options is, worst case scenario if I have $10k of puts, I can't lose more than $10k. At worse, they can drop to zero if TSLA goes to the moon. The other benefit is they are leveraged as mentioned, so if I'm really bearish, I buy puts and only slight downward movements in TSLA can mean big gains in my puts.\n\nThe downside of using options is I need the cash to buy them. I didn't want to sell any of my securities in the $140k at the time, so I couldn't buy more puts. I could short TSLA though.\n\nSo I shorted $5K and TSLA kept going up. No problem, I shorted another $5k and another $5k and another $5k as it went up a few days in a row. The higher up it goes, the less likely it will keep going up. It can't go up to infinity.\n\nThe downside to shorts is that the downside potential is unlimited. Even though I just admitted it can't go up to infinity, it's theoretically possible, and thus you could lose an infinite amount of money.\n\nHowever before it gets too high, your brokerage will margin call you, and demand you close out the short position at a loss, and sell off the rest of the stocks you had to back your margin account.\n\nIn my case, I had $140k of stocks. So I could easily short $20k of TSLA without much risk of a margin call. TSLA would have had to go to a $3T market cap company in order to risk a margin call.\n\nBut, I hedged against this by having $100k of my $140k stocks in gold stocks. Gold ETF and gold miners. In order for TSLA to hit $3T, Gold would likely soar and offset the losses in TSLA. Portfolio construction.\n\nSo the downsides to shorting are (a) risk of margin call and (b) it's linear, not leveraged in the same way options are.\n\nMy strategy has been to buy about $10k of puts, and if TSLA goes up more than 10% from that starting point, I start shorting in $5k increments, each time it goes up another 3% or so. Eventually it start coming down, and I close out the short with a small gain of 5% or so. I use that gain to buy more TSLA puts.\n\nAt other points in time TSLA is just crashing. So I dont short any shares, I let the puts I already have do the work. As the puts go up and make a 30% to 50% gain, I trim some off, back down to around $10k worth.\n\nSo I start off with $10k in puts, maybe it drops down to $7k and I short TSLA in $5k increments until I make a $1k to $2k profit in the short and use that to buy more puts, to keep it around $10k.\n\nTSLA goes down, the puts go up to $13k to $15k and I sell back down to $10k.\n\nThe cash goes into the rest of the portfolio to buy more gold miners or whatever was down that I am bullish on.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "thank you. damn, looks like I could have made a lot of cash using puts, ill buy a super small amount rn and figure those fuckers at.

OP makes it sound easy but it's not. I've been dabbling since the Covid crash and the biggest issue with options is the volatility and the fact that options decay. Unlike a short, which OP said, is linear, options are leveraged and the pricing is based on volatility.\n\nFrom purchase, the odds are stacked against you. If you look at most options profit calculators, they show this pretty clearly in a visual format. Options usually have a significantly less than 50% \"chance\" of profit. That is because of a few reasons:\n\nReason 1: is that the option makes money when the underlying (the stock) moves in the direction you predict (up for calls, down for puts), but, you are paying a PREMIUM for the option contract itself, and that premium means even if your option is In the money at expiration (i.e. you have a $350 SPY Put and SPY is $340) you might still lose money at expiration because of the premium you paid at the time.\n\nReason 2: The second reason is related to the first: the price of the option goes down over time. This is because the premium that can be charged for that option goes down. So you might pay $10 for a $305 Spy PUT when SPY is at $320 with a strike date in 4 months, but 3 months later you'd only be able to sell that $205 SPY put for $5 if SPY is still at $320. The underlying didn't move (spy price was identical both times) what changed was that the option got closer to expiration and thus the premium was lower.\n\nSo you're not only paying a premium just to play the game, you also lose over time. If the price of the underlying is inverse your position - you lose. If the price of the underlying is flat - you lose. If the price of the underlying is in the direction you predict, but not fast enough, you lose.\n\nConversely, most options have a window where they are in profit. Almost ANY option you will buy will have a period of time when it's in profit. This could be only for 5 minutes after you buy it, but because of volatile the pricing of options is, your options will often be in the green at some period. Thus, conversely, it's very possible to \"often\" win if you make good buys and SELL AT THE RIGHT TIME. The hard part is knowing WHEN to exit your position, as I was talking about above. The best you could ever see is a 1% gain on your position 10 minutes after purchase, or you could see a 200% gain 3 months after purchasing an option. So knowing when you should exit and take profits is everything, and something most people struggle with (including me, see my post above) because if you exited near the top of ever option purchase you ever make you'd be very, very rich.\n\nUnfortunately nobody can call the top, not even of their option purchase, so you need a cohesive strategy to force yourself to close when the time is right. Over time, with many plays, you should do well because if your strategy is good and you stick to it, you reduce the times when you 1. Buy the wrong option and 2.

I.e I'm playing SPY puts right now assuming the direction is down. When we see a trend reversal, news switches to positive, the fed stops with the rate hikets, etc. I'll move into calls, but until then, I don't fight the trend.  Longer options (6mo-1yr) give you much more likelyhood that at some point the underlying will move in the direction you predict and you can exit.
