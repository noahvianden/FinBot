Executioning and positioning are all that matters. If Elon Musk tweets that Tesla *wants to make a coffee machine*, they are not suddenly a competitor to Starbucks. Volkswagen [makes sausages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_currywurst), but they are not a competitor to Sysco or Tyson.\n\nThere are things that Tesla is executing well on, and deserve a place in this chart. For instance, autonomous semi trucks are justifiably a vertical for reasonable inclusion on this chart, since we know that vertical is in active development. For OP to also include VTOLs, however â€”Â a vertical within which Tesla has *no known active development whatsoever* is not even in the *same realm* of reasonability.\n\n>There are dozen things on that list that traditional automotive OEMs don't do, let alone having culture or leadership capable enough to take on such projects\n\nGreat.
