{"title": "how to short the banks", "selftext": "So I was thinking about the whole thing that PayPal tried to pull over on all it's users and when word got out, tons up on tons of people deleted their accounts in rebellion and I thought... With banks and the government at all time high  levels of fuckery, we could rebel against the banks too. When you deposit money at a bank, they borrow it and use your money to make themselves more money, like that's always been a known thing forever, so... What happens if everyone withdraws their money? Even if everyone on this sub just went and pulled out like $1000, that's a good couple billion dollars to flash yank away from them. That alone might not be enough to do serious damage to them sure, but it could certainly start a spark.
