{"title": "Energy is the only investment that matters in the next couple of years", "selftext": "Stop pissing away money on daily/weekly options when you can make huge nearly guaranteed gains on oil companies if you can wait 6 to 12 months. Fuck it, buy options but buy 12 month options instead of short dated ones so the invest thesis can play out.  \n\nWe are in the early stages of a global energy crisis. ESG advocates have dissuaded oil, gas and coal companies from investing in capital expenditures over the past 5 or 6 years. We are reaching the point that we simply do not have enough energy to power the world at an affordable rate, so energy will become unaffordable. Oil, Gas and Coal companies will make so much money over the next couple years until voters realize how unbelievably stupid the ESG policies are and that they have decimated the standard of living in America.  \n\nOil price has been decreasing lately but this has been because of the actions of governments that are attempting to lower the cost of energy. Over the next couple of months the oil demand will increase by 1 to 2 million barrels per day at the same time that the supply will decrease by 3 to 4 million barrels per day, creating a net impact of 4 to 6 million barrels per day of tighter oil markets. This will probably result in the price of oil increasing to $150 to $200 over the next year despite a recession.  \n\n* China and the US are both releasing approximately 1 million barrels per day from their SPR. US will likely stop releasing SPR oil after the election in November.  \n* Once China ends their zero covid policy of locking down cities with covid outbreaks, Chinese demand for oil will increase 1 to 2 million barrels per day.  \n* This winter, Russian supply of oil will decrease by 1 to 2 million barrels per day because Russia is not able to produce oil in Siberia during the winter without western oilfield service companies. These companies all pulled out of Russia due to the war in Ukraine.  \n\nOnly 18% of energy is used as electricity (most of which is generated with fossil fuels) and the other 82% is fossil fuels directly combusted for energy. So the vast majority of energy used is fossil fuels. The ESG crowd has convinced the world to stop investing in CapEx for fossil fuel companies because of the switch to wind and solar. There is no way to transition to wind and solar fast enough to avoid a massive energy crisis. Fossil fuels are required to mine the metals required to build the EVs, wind and solar. It will take way way way longer to make the transition compared to what the ESG crowd thinks. There is massive profit to be made from investing in these hated oil, coal and nat gas companies. Many of them have PE ratios that are 5 or lower at current prices, if oil price goes higher then they will only get better.  \n\nSome of you might think that soon there will be peace in Russia and Ukraine and all of these energy issues will go away. The west recently destroyed Russia‚Äôs two nord stream pipeline and destroyed their bridge to Crimea. Russia is furious and just started a new offensive against 20 Ukrainian cities. This war isn‚Äôt ending any time soon.  \n\nIn the short run (6 to 18 months) the best investment is oil, nat gas and coal companies. In the longer term uranium miners will be the best investment. I won't go into the details on uranium and nuclear power investment thesis in this thread, but longer term it will be a tremendous investment.
