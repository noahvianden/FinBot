They had thought that they could first forge an economic Union and then slowly work a way to a political Union. But that idea went bust. The Credit Crisis of 2012 already showed how fragile and fragmented EU really is -- incidentally, all these far-right parties across EU gained a stronghold during that time too.\n\nThe ECB can only attack the problem through monetary policy, just like the Feds in USA do. The major, crucial difference is, USA is a Union ratified through *History*. There is absolutely no fear that Texas or Alabama or Florida would secede from USA, in the event of any crisis. They are *federal states* within a country. EU is, and perhaps will be for many years to come, a Union of *sovereign countries* -- countries sometimes at each others throats, who are only begrudgingly getting along because that carrot of economic incentive is hanging in front of them. At the first sign of impending problems, they start using \"Exiting\" the EU as a political leverage.", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "Yh the diverging interests among members has always made the implementation of certain policies a nightmare. But I would think that at least there would be some sort of suggestions from the ECB.\nAnd it's like there's not been a precedent, for example during the 2012 you were talking about they created Troika that was responsible for managing the bailouts of a few countries.\nI'm not looking for forced measures or anything like that, just something...", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "They have funds and mechanism in place, there is more understanding and coordination now, one hopes. I remember the European Stability Mechanism, that was established from last credit crisis. Was around a few hundred billions. That will help cushion the blow of whatever is to come, after the ECB has no choice but to engage in serious economic tightening and recession is finally here.\n\nECB still has some kind of TLTROs in place too. They will be ready to stabilise, when needed. Right now, they need ways to drain the excess EURs out of the system since the decade of QE. Can only raise interest rates (taxes are individual country's fiscal decision), and unload the assets from balance sheet, but they are not doing the latter yet -- I am guessing this is a sign of them coordinating/following Feds. If they both can \"spook\" the markets enough to slow down inflation in coming months, it would be a success.\n\nBesides all that, the fact of Ukraine war is what weighs the most. Energy price surge propagates throughout the supply chain. Once that becomes manageable again (Germany seems well-supplied already and had a subsidy package of EUR 200 billion recently), things will get better in 2023.
