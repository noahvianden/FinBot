{"title": "NOK DD", "selftext": "Nokia just replaced their CEO w/ **Pekka Lundmark**, who was a VP at Nokia in the 90's-00's and is generally seen as a strong candidate to make effective changes. Share prices jumped when this was announced March 2nd.\n\n**SINCE THEN**, Nokia has signed partnerships with Intel and Marvell to continue investing in their 5G infrastructure. It's looking like our man Pekka is prioritizing Nokia as an infrastructure company, and going after the big contracts. \n\nThis article points out the promising elements of Nokia's push for more 5g contracts - [https://www.lightreading.com/5g/ericsson-huawei-and-nokias-5g-wins-are-no-big-deal/a/d-id/757677](https://www.lightreading.com/5g/ericsson-huawei-and-nokias-5g-wins-are-no-big-deal/a/d-id/757677)\n\n>A far more useful measure would be a regular quarterly update on market share. Under pressure to scotch concern about its 5G competitiveness, Nokia included one in its last earnings report and promised updates in subsequent financials. In the fourth quarter of 2019, it claimed 27% of the 4G and 5G RAN market outside China, where its reluctance to be as transparent suggests it is struggling. While a number that includes the world's biggest mobile infrastructure market would obviously be even more helpful, neither Ericsson nor Huawei provides anything close. Nokia also indicated that it expects to maintain its 27% share outside China this year.  \n>  \n>A market share statistic is not the only new metric recently championed by the Finnish vendor. Henceforth, it has promised to show details of what it calls the \"weighted 5G win rate.\" The idea is to demonstrate its success at converting 4G customers to 5G and securing entirely new 5G business. A figure of 100% would imply contract numbers are unchanged: Either no customers have defected, or any losses have been offset by new deals. At the end of 2019, Nokia's win rate was more than 100% outside China and in the mid-90% range including China.\n\nThe fact that they are being more transparent than their rivals is a positive signal. A 100%+ win rate outside China means they are signing **NET NEW** contracts.\n\n**BUT WAIT -** they also just announced today they upgraded their IoT network to be on 5g - [https://venturebeat.com/2020/03/17/nokia-adds-5g-to-worldwide-iot-network-lets-carriers-test-new-sensors/](https://venturebeat.com/2020/03/17/nokia-adds-5g-to-worldwide-iot-network-lets-carriers-test-new-sensors/)\n\n**BUT WAIT EVEN MORE -** in the new James Bond movie, he will be using a Nokia phone - [https://www.gsmarena.com/screengrabs\\_from\\_new\\_bond\\_trailer\\_show\\_the\\_nokia\\_82\\_5g-news-41859.php](https://www.gsmarena.com/screengrabs_from_new_bond_trailer_show_the_nokia_82_5g-news-41859.php)\n\n**TL;DR Nokia is poised to solidify its position as a strong 5G vendor in 2020.** \n\n**NOK 1/15/21 $5c, $7c, $10c**", "id": "fk8k91", "created_utc": 1584463836.0, "score": 149, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 81, "comments": [{"body": "Good DD.

One of our biggest advantages is intelligence programs. Expect to see massive government subsidies thrown to companies that compete with Hauwei. \n\n-This is a time sensitive problem too. It's a technology arms race to 5G. Expect major pressure on Nokia and Ericson to up their game. \n\n-Nokia has made some drastic moves in this sector. They've spent a ton internally at the expense of profits, brought back their old CEO, partnered with two big companies, spending on upping their marketing game. They can have another bad quarter with these kind of prospects and long term moves in place. They got the backing of National Security, whose ready to burn all the money it needs so they can beat China. \n\n-A lot of the work they have to do won't be as affected by social distancing. \n\n-Covid 19 I believe is probably at it's height for emotional impact. It's here, it's confirmed. But 99% of people are just getting bad colds and progress to treat the virus has improved dramatically in just the past few weeks. I think the public has gotten the message and social distancing is well in effect.

The virus is still spreading rampant and my best guess is that most of you fuckers will end up getting it.  So you're (hopefully) going to stay inside and not spread that shit around. I probably have it, you probably have it, and I have no fucking clue but I'm pretty healthy and feel like shit right now so it's hard to tell. \n\nAll of these people going out to bars because they have \"nothing else to do\" are going to spread it.

More people are going to turn up sick and infected, and they'll be a ton of unreported cases.\n\nStates are turning patients AWAY and REFUSING physician testing and treatments in hospitals.

The watershed shutdown decision was literally TODAY. \n\nThey are doing everything they can in the media to hold the markets down and keep it steady, I'm not trying to fear monger but this shit is NOT over YET.

Markets are sideways right now, there will be another dip before a run back to the top. \n\nThis market crash isnt a market based on financial incompetence like it was in 2008, it's a market based on a global health impact.

{"title": "Rite Aid (RAD) Mooning After Earnings 4/09", "selftext": "All right listen up autists. u/Howard_510 made a damn good DD about a month ago about RAD. Read it.\n\n[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6k5ot/rad_is_the_next_spce/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\n\nNow for the update. Yesterday was Analyst Day, and you guessed it, RAD fucking mooned. Last week, it was down over 40%. Not good right? Well yesterday, it shot up 75%. Yeah, this is better than SPCE, TSLA, GILD, or whatever autistic SPY puts you all are buying. You have the chance to get in before earnings (4/9) with 4/17 calls and make fucking bank. \n\nFor the people who’ve read this far: it’s obvious why RAD dropped so much last week. The markets in the shitter, and we’re in a recession. Soon enough, we aren’t gonna be seeing the crazy volatility and the profitability of calls and puts alike. What does that mean? It means we need to find good, undervalued stocks, and make them the new meme stocks. Fuck the biotech companies who all have the new coronavirus cure, they’re dogshit. RAD is it. In case you didn’t read the original post, they reported earnings in mid December. They beat expectations by 270%, and their stock price shot up from $7.50 to $20 in two weeks. That’s 165%. Free tendies. Can’t go tits up.\n\n[Analyst Day Report](https://www.riteaid.com/corporate/news/-/pressreleases/news-room/2020/rite-aid-to-outline-corporate-strategy-and-growth-plan-at-analyst-day)\n\nKey takeaway:\nRAD raised their guidance. Not by a ton, but think about it. A terrible quarter for the economy, and they increase their earnings expectations. Not by a ton, but why would they raise their guidance only to just barely meet it by their earnings call? They know they’re gonna knock it out of the fucking park again and yesterday was just a little taste. \n\n**Tl;dr - If you like money, load up on any RAD 4/17 calls.**\n\nPositions: I’m a broke boy until RAD moons. Only have 1 contract of RAD 15c 4/17 and 1 RAD 12c 4/17.\n\nDear SEC,\nI’m not qualified to give financial advice and therefore I would never give financial advice. This is gambling advice, just with really good odds\n\nEdit: Sorry fellows, hope you sold before earnings.
