Pulling numbers completely out of my ass what I mean is back in Feb it could look something like:\n\n- 1% chance covid19 infects nearly everyone in multiple waves and brings all global travel and most global commerce to a halt for 2 years = the market drops 70%\n\n- 4% chance covid19 causes significant disruption in most major economies and lasts 1 year = the market drops 50%\n\n- 20% chance covid19 causes significant disruption in most major economies and lasts 3-6 months = the market drops 30%\n\n- 75% chance covid19 is contained within china and the only economic impact is supply chain disruption = the market stays steady.\n\nAgain these numbers are completely pulled out of my ass but if you price in all those effects you only need to drop the market ~9% and everything is priced in, but you've got a whole lot more room to go down in those most negative scenarios. The volatility isn't necessarily that jacked up because it still considers the overwhelmingly most likely scenario to be little to no movement.\n\nThe other part of this is that the market is guessing at the likelihood of each scenario and guessing at the impact.

The market has dropped like 30% now, let's say that's because there's a 50% chance things goes back to normal and a 50% chance the market drops down to -60% (from normal conditions), now look at implied volatility now - through the fucking roof. You're 9% case would demonstrate a very noticeable \"pricing in\" of IV.\n\ntl;dr IV would've reacted much more aggressively and noticeably than stock prices if this was actually priced in in January.

The market didn’t need to panic as long as Trump denied all the threats Corona is posing to us. He always said that the US had it under control blah blah. \n\n2 Anger - the market is angry at the bad and Late response by the Western world and also by the fact that the US stock market was inflated and had liquidity issues. Also Trump’s language changes. He starts to call it a pandemic and declares national emergency. It’s time to panic. \n\n3 Bargaining WE ARE HERE - it’s not all bad. Infinite QE, stimulus bill, unemployment numbers slightly lower than the worst case 4 mil. But I think that mostly one thing affected the markets this week: Trump said that he wants to re-open the country at Easter. That’s an immensely great sign for the market. People would work again and definitely spend even more money on consumption to ‚celebrate‘ the fact that we all survived beer virus. \nThis is why I think that all your April puts are relatively safe. As soon as Trump admits that this shitshow will continue until May or even June, the market will realize that its hopes of a sudden re-opening are futile and drop even more in a short period of time. That would be your last moment to get rid of your April puts. \n\n4 Depression - welcome to the next months. \n\n5 Acceptance - as much as I love earning money from insane OTM puts, I want this to be over as soon as possible.
