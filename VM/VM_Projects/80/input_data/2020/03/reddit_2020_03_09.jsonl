If you don't know Activision-Blizzard is responsible for creating Call of Duty, Overwatch, and a few other games.  They're one of the biggest gaming companies in the world.  They are also the biggest player in the E-Sports movement, as they own MLG, and are starting their Call of Duty: Modern Warfare E-Sports League soon, that just got even more sponsors.  They've been hit by corona virus, but not nearly as much as the general stock market, and I believe they should actually have gone up because of the virus.  The only reason that they are lagging behind is because of digital art creation, with around \\~50% internationally taking place in China, and they've already started sourcing from other places.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**China is the biggest consumer of Video Games, with annual revenue of \\~$34 Billion**.  For the same reason that Netflix is up because of the virus, Activision should be up too.  People are quarantined to their houses internationally, left with digital content as their only source of entertainment in their life.  Before the crash, Activision was sitting comfortably at $64, now it's at $58 and there's no logical reason for it to be.  People just got scared that it would follow the general stock market.  The average analyst price target is $68, $10 above where its at this very moment.
