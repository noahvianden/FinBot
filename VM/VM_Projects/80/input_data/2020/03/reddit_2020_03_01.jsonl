{"title": "Two Reasons the Market will Rebound Sooner Than You Think", "selftext": "Longtime lurker, first-time poster to this sub. I’m fully cognizant that this post may not age particularly well next week, or in the weeks hence, ([especially in light of recent news](https://nypost.com/2020/02/29/pope-francis-cancels-third-day-of-events-amid-mysterious-illness/)) but whatever; I have no shame putting myself out there. This is why God gave us anonymous Reddit handles.\n\n**One:** It’s an election year.  Trump absolutely won’t let this market fail.  By hook or crook, he will 100% do everything within his power (and not in his power) to prop up the market.  (Including working Powell like a sock puppet.)\n\n**Two:** Investors will eventually realize/recollect what I still remember from two weeks ago:  It’s a classic chase for yield.  As expensive as they’d gotten, as recently as two weeks ago, [US equities still remained a bastion of growth compared to virtually *everywhere else* in the world](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/300-trillion-household-assets-bullish-us-stocks-morning-brief-110559102.html).   And that was *before* COVID-19.  If the rest of the world was already teetering on the precipice of blazing-dumpster-firedom *before* the Coronavirus outbreak, now the full-on zombie apocalypse has actually arrived, where do you think all of those pension funds/hedge funds/etc are going to get their returns for 2020? (They need to be able to somehow justify charging those fat fees!)  [Italy?](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2020/02/18/807025154/ciao-italia-why-italys-youth-are-leaving-in-droves) [The UK?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brexit) [Germany?](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/20/world/europe/germany-hanau-shisha-bar-shooting.html)  China?  America has now literally become the only game in town. The market is forward-looking; after the initial panic settles, where will that chase for yield go?\n\nGame on.  I’m all in. Last week hedge funds suddenly woke up and remembered why they existed. But eventually, when the inevitable rebound happens, I expect Big Algo to launch it into the *stratosphere*. It shall be thunderous unlike any man has ever witnessed before. I obviously have no idea where the *exact* bottom is, but I’ve learned that precisely timing it is a fool’s errand. (If you’re able to do it, then good on you. I am happy for you; I am simply not as skilled as you are.) The only way (for me at least) is to ride it out. Assuming you’re not facing a margin call, etc, my humble suggestion is to just take a vacation and not even look at what’s going on. Check back in a week or month or two.\n\n(Disclaimer: I’m personally currently long AMD and MU– I believe in the Big Data Story! PS.

He can't pass any legislation, and the one and only big piece he did pass during his whole term was a huge cut for billionaires/corporations. So he doesn't have to actually *pass* legislation, he just needs to *promise* it.  And guess what he just started doing again: promising some mysterious \"middle class\" tax cut.   The cuts can be as fraudulent as the last ones.  His followers ar paying more but claiming they're not.  Reality has no meaning.\n\nBut then you say there's nothing else he can do.  So wrong.  He can declare fake victory in his fake trade war against China.  Like everything he says, it can be a lie.  Look at what his fake and bizarre \"phase one deal\" announcement did to supercharge stock prices.  Him declaring \"the war is over\" (again) will elevate stocks.  He'll know that following the election he can just declare a new fake war if he feels like it or if his age-related paranoia kicks in.\n\nNext, he can make fraudulent \"infrastructure\" promises.

It is election year and Trump can pump the market all he wants, but hard data will work against him. By hard data I’m referring to the economic drag caused by this virus. A lot of companies in the US have direct exposure to China, with most of their factory being shut down, it’s going to have a drag on earnings. \n\nSecond is, stocks have skyrocketed to new highs based on greed, cheap borrowing, and part of the tax cut from Trump. Corporate and consumer debt is at all time high, It’s a matter of time before the bubble burst. \n\nIn the long run, I’m a bull, I believe the market will go up, but in the immediate short term, the market will go down, I’m predicting another 5-10%, I could be wrong of course. \n\nMy takeaway is this, until we fix the issue with corona virus, there will be more pain to come. Also, consider that the US lack an adequate testing and prevention against this virus, with cases popping up, it’s a matter of time before it gets worst, and from there, consumer spending(that drives US economy), will drop", "score": 36, "replies": [{"body": "> By hard data I’m referring to the economic drag caused by this virus.

I don't have a fancy MBA or work at some prestigious, boutique financial firm.  I'm just a guy trying to day/swing-trade for a living in my humble abode.  Watching the show, *Billions*, back in 2016 is what first piqued my interest.  And I started actively trading at the beginning of 2019.\n\n**One:**  Re hard economic data and China-- It's a country of \\~1.4 billion people.  Because of the one-child policy that lasted for decades, there's also a pretty big M/F gender disparity.  Additionally, in such a top-heavy government, Xi cannot afford to look weak for much longer; his COVID-19 honeymoon is quickly waning, IMHO.  Many big companies are already highly automated anyways.  Those of them that aren't will simply throw human bodies at the assembly lines to meet production quotas again, regardless of the infections.  Remember, there are no human rights in China; it's a communist state.  Either come to work or you're fired and will never work again *anywhere* for the rest of your days.  I recall that scene from Chernobyl where the workers were already so badly radiated that they decided to just keep shoveling the uranium \"for the greater good.\"  In times of crisis, humans lives (esp in communist states) are forfeit and cheap in the mission of the almighty dollar/RMB.  Gotta keep the engine of capitalism humming!  (There is some great irony in this, I know.)\n\n**Two:**  Looking forward, what is the strategic macro picture?  Here's my speculation for several moves ahead on the board:\n\n\\- Meat-space is going to get increasingly more fraught.  I currently live in an apt rental complex and I already see those Amazon Prime vans making multiple trips *a day* delivering stuff to our complex.  Millennials are already reluctant to go outside.  My God, back in my day, going to the mall, getting pizza, and hanging out at the arcade was a thing.  [Nowadays.](https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2019/05/dead-malls-everywhere/588970/) \n\n\\- The other day I was in line at our local Walmart (when times are good, it's Target and Whole Foods.  When times are like now, it's Walmart and Aldi's) and some guy ahead of me was in line was trying to use multiple gift cards to make a huge purchase.  There was some problem with the register and the whole ordeal took something like ten minutes as the queue grew increasingly long, with everyone inline considerably annoyed.   Yes, there was something like twenty registers, but only three were manned at the time (it was a weekday afternoon).  I mean, seriously, can you blame millennials for not wanting to venture out into meat-space?  It's awful.\n\n\\- So back to now:  What are the implications of COVID-19?  Will it make meat-space more attractive or less?  You do that math.  My feeling is that the Coronavirus will just accelerate what had already been a growing trend:  People doing more commerce from home, people being more entertained at home, etc.  I'm a big follower of a16z and their big claim to fame is *\"Software is Eating the World.\"*  I wholeheartedly believe in that.  This is why I currently have huge positions and am overweight in memory and semiconductors.  I believe in more datacenters, more people going online (according to Andreessen, only half of the global population is currently online.  Vast swathes of South America, Africa, etc are still in the queue), and the basic human way-of-life is fundamentally changing.\n\n**Also:**  I do believe we'll eventually figure out crypto.
