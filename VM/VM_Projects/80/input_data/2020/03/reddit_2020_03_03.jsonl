{"title": "PSA: Interest Rate cuts (and other monetary policies) can’t fix a supply shock.", "selftext": "It seems some of you degenerates are taking the expected interest rate cuts at face value.\n\nI think it’s time for a lesson in Macroeconomics.\n\nNow to start.\n\nOf the four “tools” the FED uses to control the country’s economy, the federal funds rate seems to have the most tangible effect on the economy. In terms of the markets.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n>wHeN inTeRESt rATeS gO doWn, bAnK sAy “I HaVE MonEe ” \n\n\n>BaNk gOs tO fEd and ask “hOw MuCH iT cosT FoR mOnee?”\n\n\n>Fed say “a sPriNkle UndEr 1.75%” \n\n\n>BaNk say “oK tHx” \n\n\n>BoRoweR go tO bAnK anD sAy “I HavE tHiS mUch moneE”\n\nAnd then the bank loans an appropriate amount of money based on the fed funds benchmark rate and the collateral of the borrower. When rates are high borrowing goes down because the cost of money is expensive and the opposite happens when rates are down. \n\nNow this is fine and dandy when the problem has to do with investment in the economy. It works well and GDP posts a positive outlook. However, since the current decline is a result of a virus that is literally shutting down the manufacturing center of the world, there will be more money circulating but there will be not enough raw materials or goods to spend it on. This along with the increase in the money supply in the United States creates what is known as cost-push inflation.\n\nCost-push inflation is when the aggregate supply decreases this stints economic growth and causes consumer prices to rise. This is called a supply shock. \n\nAs firms try to meet stakeholder expectations, they may cut labor in the short-run (because you can’t be as productive with lower available inputs) and unemployment will increase. If this persists (which it likely will, the US economy is already overheated and far below the natural unemployment rate) It results in what is known as stagflation.\n\nDuring a period of stagflation inflation is occurring at the same time as a decrease in buying power. Consumer spending falls off a cliff and STONKS GO DOWN. \n\n\nAnd that’s not even the worst of it. \n\n\nSince interest rates are already so low the USA will be entering uncharted waters by continuing to lower them.\n\nUsually when the eventual rebound of a supply shock occurs the fed can lower the rates and kick start investment again, but if the rates have no where to go but 0 and it comes to that, there will be no incentive for banks to loan funds. AND THEN BOOOM GOES THE FUCKING DYNAMITE. \n\nNew research is conducted to prevent such a calamity from ever happening again, some policy is enacted, and the cycle begins anew. Then STONKS GO UP.

I've had various success with credit spreads, but I've also been nailed a few times if it starts going against you, you will have max loss on the spread which is probably a lot more than losing the value of your option.  Then you have to close both legs anyway, so again if it starts to reverse against you the spread will also reflect that.", "score": -1, "replies": [{"body": "That's if you open it as a spread from the beginning. If you buy one call for example and it runs up 100%. you want to lock in profits with no more day trades, you then sell a call a strike above or below so that if in case tomorrow the stock drops lowering your option value it would be offset by the premium received which increases in your favor.

If SPY starts to go back up both the put I sold and bought are now worth less, but you're saying I'll keep the $900 premium.  If spy continues to tank I've now capped my gain though, right, as both will continue to increase in value.  I feel like this play works best only when the play turns against you?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Many ways you could use it but in this case what OP was saying is if you're out of day trades. So let's say your 305p is worth $1000 and you want to sell but trapped due to PDT, if you sell a 304p for $900 and the next day price of stock goes up, your 305p (pretend) is now worth $750 and the 304p is now worth $650. You close the  305p position the next day for $750, and since you sold the 304p for $900 and only have to buy back at $650 gives you $250 gain from that. So you end up with $750 (sale of 305p) + $250 (gain from sell/buy of 304p)=$1000. See how your profit was still \"locked in\" in a sense? Of course, yes you would cap your upside gains but it's just protection if you're scared the market will go against you before you were able to cash out.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Cool ok one other question.
