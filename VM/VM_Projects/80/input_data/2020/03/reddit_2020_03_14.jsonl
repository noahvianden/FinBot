The reason that experience is valuable, though, isn’t because it teaches you fundamentals - it teaches you about controlling emotions. Honesty this is a great time to be making money, but a shitty time to be learning. It’s so easy to make money right now, you likely won’t have the experience of staring at your options wondering things like “why is my call going down even when the price of the stock is going up”? Because this market moves so fast, you’ll either be up 5x or down 50%+ in no time at all. See, I have adhd as well, and I read about this shit in books, but it didn’t really stick. Concepts like “IV crush”. I knew what it was, and I knew the definition, but I didn’t really UNDERSTAND what it meant until I bought an option on a company right before earnings, and watched my call go down 50% while the stock went up 2%. I was so confused, and it stood out in my mind because it was so emotional (losing money SUCKS), that when I went back and started reading up on IV crush again, it actually had some context this time. So that helped me understand what IV crush is, and at the same time, helped me understand IV a lot better, and how it affects a stock. So it’s things like that, that come with experience, that will help you understand the concepts after you’ve done some trading. But I can tell you, it’s much better to just be learning your emotions when you’re using real money, because you’re already comfortable with the fundamentals. If you’re learning both as you go, you’re gonna have a rough time. Read through some of these posts, you’ll see tons of people just like you, that started with a tiny bit of money, made a SHITLOAD of money because they got lucky a couple times, and then gave it all right back because they never really knew what they were doing in the first place. You don’t want to be one of those people, but unless you approach each trade with a plan, and know what you’re doing, I can assure you that you will eventually lose it all back.
