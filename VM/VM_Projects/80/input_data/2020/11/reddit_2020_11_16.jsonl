Every time I try to understand that, I come up empty. Just as empty as the reason why SPY waited so long. They knew TSLA was coming, they knew it was going to become eligible at some point. They should have prepared for it and announced inclusion the day after Q2 results. So not doing that was the first big mistake.\n\nSecond mistake was to wait for Q3. I mean, sure, the stock fell sharply as all the gamblers got out, but the gamblers were in in the first place because of the negligance in the first place. So it sort of was too late at that point, but after the stock went down and TSLA issued new shares, there was a period where gamblers were not an issue. They missed that.\n\nNow, they give TSLA a 30 day runway. They know index funds would buy close to inclusion date. So what time do they need to prepare? This only gives gamblers the opportunity to front run the index funds and squeeze them. It all could have been over within 5 days with a massive increase in stock value.. but with this long runway, the float might get artificially reduced. So that might have been the final mistake. SPY might have started to dig its own grave as index funds dont want to be exposed to this kind of stupidity.\n\nSo what I am doing here, I am posting the hypothesis that the index funds will get squeezed. Obviously we only know after the fact, but as hypothesis goes, you can try to invalidate it by finding a counter argument. So.. does any of you have an idea how this 30 day runway could help the index funds? If so, how? How can this not end in a massive squeeze?", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "There’s no set rules that if the funds don’t do something they get a fine. There’s also no rule where funds have to be 100% market weighted.

Its obviously within the rules of each individual fund. That makes the stacked inclusion of S&P all the more strange in my opinion, because it adds 0 value to the process.\nOn the other hand, historically, most of the funds bought the day before inclusion. So there IS some concentration.\n\nAlso, if Gary Black is to be believed, index fund managers are payed to track the index, not get a cheap price. So they have not much incentive if they smooth the process at the cost of tracking accuracy.\n\nAsking here because I think I am missing something, therefore want to hear folks shoot down the hypothesis.", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "As investors we do seem fixated on indexes getting a good deal. They don’t care, nor should they. They just want the SAME deal. The best deal for an index tracker is one where every other tracker buys at the same price.

Why is this needed? Because as almost all companies vest more and more into their IT stack, the more of a shit show it can become. Most mid to large companies have around 10+ internal systems they use to service their customers across all business units. Hell you might even work somewhere where you have to log into 6 different systems each day to do your job. \n\nReporting on the data in each of those systems even if they're integrated already can be super challeging - this is where Palantir comes in.
