{"title": "$WORK will keep running 🚀 🚀 🚀", "selftext": "Alright, autists, I know what you're thinking. \"WORK ALREADY WENT UP 37% WEDNESDAY AND YOU BRING THE DD NOW?\" Calm your tits and hear me out. 3 Reasons why WORK can continue to climb. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n1) ARKK's 6th largest holding (at 4.4% of the fund) is WORK. They even bought more WORK shares around $27 on 11/06. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d17og8c2tp161.png?width=2104&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac006decd09409efabbe6c4d01bb8c561eff51d9\n\nARK is known to sell some shares when a stock is hitting all time high and yet, they did not sell a single share on Wednesday. ARK must believe WORK is worth more and CRM will pay more than $40 for WORK. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n2)  Software company acquisitions usually come at a premium of 30-50% which correlates to $39 to $45 per share for WORK. I believe CRM will pay $45 or more because CRM sees the value of integrating WORK in their suite of software. WORK acquisition will most likely double or even triple the value of WORK under CRM. CRM knows this and the board of WORK knows this. WORK will not be sold without a high premium.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3) Amazon is a big customer of WORK and may want to acquire WORK instead of having to use CRM's software. Google is another player that could join in this bidding war which will surely pump WORK up to $50 or even $60 if this lasts a while. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood luck and may the tendie gods bless us. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPosition: $WORK  01/15/21 $45C", "id": "k1v1c5", "created_utc": 1606454479.0, "score": 132, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 80, "comments": [{"body": "buy PLTR got it", "score": 219, "replies": [{"body": "This is the way.", "score": 19, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Maybe no one was working on Wednesday", "score": 90, "replies": [{"body": "Ark sold shares of DOYU, GBTC and XONE on Wednesday.", "score": 30, "replies": [{"body": "Lmao I meant they all prob went home by the time WORK news came", "score": 19, "replies": []}, {"body": "Probably should buy into huya as it is going to merge with douyu", "score": 4, "replies": []}, {"body": "Sell X^^^(BOX)ONE, buy PS5.
