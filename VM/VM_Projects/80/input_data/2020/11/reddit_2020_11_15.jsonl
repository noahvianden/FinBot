People buy many NVDA GPUs because they know a lot of people need them so they know they can resell them at higher prices. If NVDA made a lot more GPUs then people could buy from NVDA instead.

The reason they are active is because scalpers know they can buy all the GPUs available and deliver a profit. Take for example NVDA produces an arbitrary number of additional GPUs. Demand for GPUs stays the same but supply increases. There's 2 things that happen in this scenario:\n\n1. Bots continue to buy all GPUs available, their profit margins reduce (possibly to zero or below) because demand stays the same but supply drastically increases. They suddenly have an insanely large quantity of graphics cards and demand cannot support their profit. They stop the bots from buying.\n\n2. If bots don't stop buying all the additional GPUs available, scalpers have to increase the price to compensate for the loss of profit. At a point, people will look for complimentary complimentary goods.
