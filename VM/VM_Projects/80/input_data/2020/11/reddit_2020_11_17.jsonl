Inclusion happened early which makes sense.\n\nNormal inclusions are 3-10 days.  Never in the history of S&P has an inclusion been announced 35 days prior like Tesla.\n\nBut, also never in the history of S&P included a company as large as TSLA.\n\nStock split caused a really nice rally for a couple weeks which was unfounded on solid grounds.\n\nS&P inclusion will buy up 10% of all available float shares (shares that are \"for sale\" by retail etc) (not elon and other people who won't sell)\n\nOver 120,000,000 share will need to be bought by the inclusion date, AND NOT SOLD.  They basically turn into non-float shares which takes them out of rotation.\n\nMy suggestion: BUY TESLA IN ANY FORM POSSIBLE\n\nshares, calls, LEAPS, whatever.  The only stipulation is to do it ASAP.  This will be a month long bleed up easily pushing us past ATH of 500 a share.\n\nThis idea is not based on fundamentals of the company, elon, or anything else.  Simply the statistics of how many shares need to be bought and how many are available to sell.\n\nHow many people in the right mind would sell at 420-480 knowing that 120million shares will be bought and held over the next month?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Buy TSLA shares/calls/leaps\n\nstonks only go up, especially when index managers have no free will over the time constraint or how many shares they need to buy.
