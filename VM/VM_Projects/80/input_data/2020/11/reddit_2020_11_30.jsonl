If I do a condor in January in AAPL I'm really making a bet on IV going lower, and ideally that means the stock going sideways as well. But closer in, like your Dec 4th example, it's not really about IV, it's more just about whether the stock stays within your strikes. So the strikes you chose are essentially in line with the expected move, meaning your condor is establishing a range of profitability for a scenario that will likely play out 2/3 times (it stays inside). However, that 3rd time likely means max loss. So the risk/reward ratio on that trade is great near 50/50... but gets less great the closer it gets to risking say 65 to make 35 cuz then your essentially at even odds.
