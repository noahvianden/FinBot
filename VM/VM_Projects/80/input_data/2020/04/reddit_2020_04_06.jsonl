I tend to agree with your analysis, but in this case I firmly disagree with the sentiment presented. On a Macro scale, US Shale has undercut OPEC+ and crude since the introduction of hydro fracking. Fracking at its core is a far more labor intensive endeavor and requires a far higher capital expenditure and operating expenditure in order to produce the same amount of oil when compared to traditional crude production. US Shale companies don't hit profits unless WTI is trading at above $60/bbl; as you know, WTI is currently trading at $29 which is already heavily inflated because of the Trump tweet. Many shale companies have already turned off their pumps for the time being and more will continue to every week proceeding forward. The oil price war started by the Russians and instigated by the Saudis is no closer to being solved. Like I said before, since the introduction of hydrofracking, Shale has been responsible for the global production increase, undercutting OPEC standards. Russia specifically, has no intention in cutting production to give back market share to uneconomical US shale producers. Furthermore, Russia knows that the US producers can not cut production as it violates anti-trust laws in the US so they are going to continue to flood the market with cheap oil. To make matters worse, reports of oil supply shortage are sure to keep prices low. Now the elephant in the room is that oil consumption is at a 20 year low and likely will continue to get worse as Corona debilitates travel, supply chains and manufacturing. We saw the biggest single day spike in price on Thursday based off of a superficial tweet, it would not surprise me to see oil have historic drops in the upcoming weeks. I also disagree that the sentiment is positive from the OPEC+ talks, anyone with half a brain knows they are not going to cut oil by 15mbbs and even 5mbb would be a far out stretch.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Why does stonk go up when oil goes up", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Selling when US cases are confirmed stabilized", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "You can do a lot of analysis and look at a lot of charts and still be wrong", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": ">Elevated crude prices supports the equity market\n\nlol maybe you should check the price of oil since 2014", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I think I’m going to jump on those Apple puts, 4/17 seems like an insanely high risk position though.
