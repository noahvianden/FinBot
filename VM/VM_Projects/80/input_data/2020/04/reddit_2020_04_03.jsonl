It means those equivalent puts and calls have the same IV.\n\nSure, the may not quite look like it sometimes, but when you account for carrying costs and the market maker fucking your wife, they always do.\n\nWhat does all this imply?\n\nWell, you have to next understand how black-Scholes works.  When you use black-Scholes to price an option, something called Geometric Brownian motion is used to model underlying volitility.\n\nThe thing is... This brownian motion has no downside or upside bias.  It is just a cute little bell curve that expects a downside movement just as often as an upside one and  is just sort of a random walk.\n\nOK, so... Knowing all this, what does it mean for VIX?\n\nWell, it means basically VIX must increase based on big upside movement because if it didn't, the underlying models used to price options would be breaking put/call parity, and there would be arbitage.\n\nVIX don't usually spike as much on upward moves because markets generally move upward slowly, but slam quickly to the ground when shit goes bad.\n\nFind a market with big upward moves and you will find big VIX too.
