Results from SARS 2003 trials were grim.\n\n‚ÄúThese SARS-CoV vaccines all induced antibody and protection against infection with SARS-CoV. However, challenge of mice given any of the vaccines led to occurrence of Th2-type immunopathology suggesting hypersensitivity to SARS-CoV components was induced.

We have never successfully vaccinated against a corona virus. COVID-2019 is a highly transmittable diseases while its little brother SARS 2003 was easy to contain.\n \n‚ÄúWith SARS, most human-to-human infections occurred in health care settings that lacked robust infection control procedures. When infection control practices were implemented, the outbreak ended. Since then, the only occurrences have occurred through laboratory accidents. They have not spread throughout the community.\n\nCOVID-19 appears to spread person-to-person, through droplets that are expelled when a person coughs or sneezes and then are inhaled by a nearby person. Less often, it may be spread by touching an infected surface and then touching one‚Äôs mouth, nose, or eyes. Transmission may also occur before a person becomes symptomatic‚Äù\n\n[SARS 2003 v COVID-19 Comparison](https://www.biospace.com/article/comparison-2003-sars-pandemic-vs-2020-covid-19-pandemic/)\n\nNow you may be thinking?

My criteria was to figure out who might win, and then,of those, which had a small enough market cap that success would be transformative to them and form an appropriate WSB-style options play. My TLDR conclusion is that it's very possible (\\~35-40%) we get sufficient vaccine availability later this year to choke off outbreaks, which is in turn followed by broad availability the following year, early.\n\nEDIT: I will go into a lot of detail on that, but to your core thesis, which is that most SARS vaccines caused animal models to get even sicker when confronted with SARS, my response would be it's precisely the existence of that research that makes this vaccine more likely to win fast because you know the issue and can work around (and paper specifically calls out some proteins better than others for this reason, Spike being better than N). I wrote follow-up DD at the end.END OF EDIT\n\nI read a bunch of the literature you cited and others first. Then I called a bunch of friends of friends - some analysts, but also a virologist who works on vectors for gene therapy, but has done a lot of RNA virus work and some DNA virus work, and a research oncologist who is not a specialist in this field but understands the dynamics and is a superstar in his field and has some important patents in immunotherapy fields.  I am not a biologist or doctor, but I have a science background.\n\nHere was what I got to:\n\n1. If a phase 1 trial is working, the vaccine can be GREATLY accelerated if we a) pre-build production capability, and b) are willing to test phase 1 and 2 subjects with virus directly (normally not done) in order to form a high-quality data set that can get emergency authorizations quickly and push forward to effectively having a phase 3 done fast. In some scenarios, that means broadly available vaccine for high-risk groups this year for early vaccines, and soon after for many of the others. Right now, people ARE pre-building production capability, AND we are already shortcutting safety some (phase 1 moderna without animal model).\n2. Most of the big company vaccine attempts are credible and done by good teams. But they will be slower. At least one of them WILL succeed.\n3. Coronavirus doesn't seem at a glance especially hard. It's a slow mutating virus that is stimulating neutralizing antibodies on bits that do not seem to mutate that fast, and there are several bits that are good neutralization targets.  One big X factor behind all of this is - hard or easy to vaccinate disease. In some scenarios, MOST vaccine approaches work. In others, FEW OR NONE work.  Your theory is that vaccination attempts will cause immunopathy per the paper, and that's the likeliest issue that needs work-around that would cause broad failure.\n4. SARS antibodies are cross-reactive with COVID-19, and have some neutralizing power. This is helpful because we can use our SARS vaccine knowledge to not repeat mistakes. This also implies a more stable virus.\n5. The MRNA, DNA and Adenovirus approaches are valid and have important differences but are kind of similar (I'm not a biologist, but all three find a way to inject foreign DNA which becomes RNA or directly RNA into a cell to then pump out a subset of the viral proteins of COVID, once, and then not replicate). They are desirable for working around the known issues. Seperateyl, Adenovirus vector used to have rejection issues, but mostly worked around now.\n6. There's never been so much brain power at a vaccine topic, and we know a lot about the disease already, antibodies that seem to work, and had SARS vaccine attempts. All of this greatly helps all vaccine approaches, but especially the MRNA/DNA and vector approaches, because you specifically choose these proteins to be the ones in the payload to be sure to be neutralizing, and avoid the issues you mentioned..\n7. Moderna amping up to max dose in their phase 1 is not a bad sign, and may be a good sign, as it definitely means lower doses were not showing signs of over-response. But, it doesn't disprove your thesis. The longer we don't see a safety issue from it, the more it does weaken your thesis though (since your thesis would be that a vaccinated person may end up blowing up when challenged by virus).\n\nThe conclusion I got from asking a bunch of questions of the various scientists I had access to is that there's likely at least a low double digit % chances that either the Chinese vaccine (which just went phase 2), or the Inovio, or the Moderna vaccine (or all three) will work without a ton of tweaking and time, and hit their 'best case' timelines. The other conclusion I got is that this will get solved - none of the scientists I talked to thought this problem going to be unsolved a year from now across all the contendors (vaccines injected into patients could go longer in worst cases), but all conceded it's not solved until it's solved, and its possible it won't be.\n\nBecause Inovio and Moderna are very small and smallish companies respectively, and I think the chance that one or the other wins this is in the ballpark of 30%+, I entered into calls a few weeks ago - Nov 20 $20 for Ino and Jan 15 $50 2021 for MRNA.  I don't know that the pricing is attractive with the run-up now, but I'm still in them.\n\nMy sense is that if they are on track to win, we will know that inside a few months. One of the guys I talked to put emphasis on Inovio having Gates backing, despite them being behind Moderna, but likes Moderna too. There is some chance the general approach there is just correct and 'easy', in which case speed matters more, and Moderna has a big advantage.\n\nI don't know what the value of the prize is, but it's probably small compared to the global benefit. But even at $100/dose profit across half of the western world, that would boost their market caps several 10s of billions of dollars, on top of any other brand halo, prestige, future contracts on preventative vaccines, etc they get.\n\nEDIT 4/19: Followed up based on discussion on thread under this today with the people I initially talked to. Relevant articles are the one the OP posted which at the end talks about mitigation strategies, and then this easy to read roll up article: [https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/117/15/8218.full.pdf](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/117/15/8218.full.pdf)\n\nAs for the calls I made - Virologist had little to add other than that ADE is really not a big concern for him here, the question would be garbage antibodies/immunopathy, which is what the OP paper referenced. The research oncologist told me a few things:\n\n\\- Agreed with virologist, ADE is likely not a major risk (which specifically refers to antibodies facilitating infection of immune cells and in turn way more virus), the risk is the immunopathy finding, which is an inflammatory immune system cascade. The fix is probably to ensure that a lot of neutralizing antibodies are made (that prevent infection after binding), and that as few non-neutralizing antibodies are made by the recipient as possible. The problem emerges when the infection gains a foothold, and then a ton of antibody activity happens without dropping disease because the antibodies arent neutralizing, and then the immune system starts spinning too hard and in the wrong ways.  That's what the OP paper linked had - lots of neutrophils with damage in lungs. The best candidates for protein targets seem to be spike-protein oriented, possibly fragments of it such as on the receptor binding domain, since you'd expect those are neutralizing, and that paper referenced them as possibly better. He doesn't think anyone fully understands this, but was pretty sure that's the strategy, and very sure the issue is understood by the people doing the work.\n\n\\- He disclaimed heavily that quantifying the difficulty of fixing this is really hard, but knowing people know the issue clearly and are watching for it, and some animal models didn't have this issue, matters a lot. So, he's optimistic, but finds it hard to predict on any particular thing, just that they 'can' work.  He doesn't feel this is an insurmountable issue, though he can't say it ISN'T - it could be insurmountable and it could be we don't get a vaccine.\n\n\\- He gets very little direct info flow from the vaccine developers because they are all industry and the ones who know the most are focused on their projects.\n\n\\- Lastly, a LOT of top tier talent in adjacent fields is dropping everything right now and doing COVID work. This should lead to a lot of diverse insight that will improve understanding of the disease, and facilitate therapies also vaccine strategies and fixes. The total brainpower on this is very, very high compared to ordinary disease situations, and also has diversity that ordinary disease situations might not have, so you would expect acceleration of all timelines on vaccines and therapeutics from the volume of work and the creativity of it coming from the varied perspectives from adjacent experts.\n\nEdit 4/21 - researcher shared this with me, which discusses OP‚Äôs major concern and mitigation strategies:\n\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41577-020-0321-6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41577-020-0321-6)\n\nEdit 4/22:\n\nMERS vaccine in monkeys targets spike protein, no immunopathy, VERY bullish news:\n\n [https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/investigational-chimp-adenovirus-mers-cov-vaccine-protects-monkeys](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/investigational-chimp-adenovirus-mers-cov-vaccine-protects-monkeys)", "score": 17, "replies": [{"body": "Yep, using the RBD portion of the spike protein should be the safest region to avoid immune issues and confer neutralizing antibodies from the vaccine.
