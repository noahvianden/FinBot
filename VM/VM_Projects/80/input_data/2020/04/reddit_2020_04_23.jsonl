{"title": "Stock Watch List April 23, 2020", "selftext": "Good morning, here's my watch list for today\n\nGap Ups: BLPH, BNTX, FLIR, IMMU, INO, JNUG/NUGT, NAT, NLS, SNBR,  ZM\n\nGap Downs: AYX, CROX, CTXS, HSY, PDD, STX, TGT\n\nEarnings season has officially started, in the near future we should start seeing some more opportunities than usual. As for today, pre market is flat while the SPY tries to make it's way over the 50 day moving average. As far as gappers go, there is a few but not many good ones that I like so I will be patient at open as yesterday was pretty choppy for the first hour or so until the market found direction. If SPY can break and hold over the 50 DMA, we have room to the 200 DMA which is currently at around 300. I feel repetitive saying this but due to the comments and messages I will continue to say it, always have a target and stop calculated Before you take any trades, this is important to eliminate emotions and give you an exit plan in case price moves against you. If you dn't use a target price then use a moving average or trend to capture profits.
