Tech will not only weather this situation but will most likely move up. Almost every tech position can be done from home (unless you work in manufacturing and production of components), so layoffs are almost non existent. \n\nAlso, how do you think people who don’t work in tech are currently working from home? Via technology. \n\nOur company has actually started buying more end-user equipment in the name of social distancing. Users who previously shared machines are now getting their own workstations. \n\nUsers who are now working from home may not have all the equipment necessary to do so and the company is spending money on devices and peripherals they need to do their jobs remotely. \n\nWe were also slowly transitioning from Skype and WebEx to Microsoft Teams; shelter in place just propelled that transition. I imagine there are a lot of other companies now looking at all-in-one platforms for business services, as well as cloud storage, that previously had no use for them or found it too costly and time consuming to make the switch. However, once they get familiar and start to reap the efficiency benefits of these services they will continue to use them after this ordeal is over. \n\nOn another note, with everyone staying home what do you think kids/young adults are doing? Gaming or using tech services. With TrumpBux and expanded unemployment people who previously had no expendable cash flow (and most likely still won’t have it but will have a lump some of cash and nothing to do) will be blowing that money. And what do you buy when your stuck in the house? Electronics. \n\nThe caveat here is whether or not production and manufacturing can keep up.
