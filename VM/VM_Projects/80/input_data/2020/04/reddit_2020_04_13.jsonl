{"title": "My last post for you retards - $SPY Bullish TA", "selftext": "$SPY Technical Analysis 4/13/20 - Bullish, Potential Entries on Monday\n\nA Quick Note: This is meant to be a purely charting and analytical approach to evaluating market movements.  Although I have been very successful in the past predicting movements traders should always make an effort to adjust their positions based on changing political and media landscapes. This approach isn‚Äôt meant to be any more accurate than a meteorologist predicting the weather. Take positions at your own risk and always do your own due diligence. I release these for thoughtful criticism from traders who use different approaches for analysis.\n\nTl;dr: Bullish in the short term but there is going to be a wall of resistance after 285.
