Here's Buffett's Advice.", "selftext": "[https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/04/08/should-you-buy-stocks-now-or-wait-heres-buffetts-a.aspx](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/04/08/should-you-buy-stocks-now-or-wait-heres-buffetts-a.aspx)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's Buffett's advice for a stock market crash.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## 1. Don't try to time the bottom\n\nWhile Buffett may be nicknamed the Oracle of Omaha, he's always been quick to admit that timing the market is a fool's errand, even for himself.\n\n\"I make no attempt to forecast the market -- my efforts are devoted to finding undervalued securities,\" the **Berkshire Hathaway** ([NYSE:BRK.A](https://www.fool.com/quote/nyse/berkshire-hathaway-a-shares/brk.a/)) ([NYSE:BRK.B](https://www.fool.com/quote/nyse/berkshire-hathaway-b-shares/brk.b/)) chairman and CEO has said.\n\nBuffett has taken this stance even further, implying in Berkshire's 1992 shareholder letter that near-term market forecasts can be \"poison\" for investors. \n\nInstead of focusing his energy on timing the market, Buffett devotes his efforts to finding great businesses at good prices. \"If we think a business is attractive, it would be very foolish for us to not take action on that because we thought something about what the market was going to do,\" Buffet said during the company's 1994 shareholder meeting.\"If you're right about the businesses, you'll end up doing fine.\" \n\nIt's Buffett's skill at finding undervalued high-quality businesses that has earned him the nickname Oracle of Omaha -- not his ability to time the market. Further, his decision to *avoid* timing the market has likely aided his stock-picking prowess.\n\n## 2. Don't waste a good buying opportunity\n\nOne of the biggest problems with investors making market timing a key part of their investment strategy is that it can result in missing out on opportunities to buy stocks at lower prices while they are busy trying to predict a bottom of a market sell-off. Since predicting the bottom of a downturn is so difficult (if not impossible) the best way for investors to take advantage of these opportunities is to simply be a net buyer of stocks over time, particularly when stocks of quality companies go down in price.\n\n## 3. Get in the game and stay in it\n\nProbably the biggest takeaway from Buffett's discussions on market crashes and market timing is simply this: Be a net buyer of stocks and stay invested for the long haul.", "id": "fxjake", "created_utc": 1586395960.0, "score": 125, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 81, "comments": [{"body": "4.

Numbers are added to each time the Fed does it. What are we on now, QE6? “Not QE” was basically QE5.\n\nQE artificially induces inflation... some believe that eventually printing money will not work and instead the Fed will induce inflation with no real economic growth. Some people theorize this could occur if they overreact and do too much QE when it is not needed. Every time the Fed tries to undo a QE, markets throw a temper (“taper”) tantrum, so they never do. \n\nWe’ve seen the effects of this already. It stops winning companies from potentially failing since, historically, in an economic depression winner and loser companies fail, unlike a regular recession. That’s a good thing.\n\nHowever, it also stops many losers from failing, which some believe leads to slower real economic growth and less innovation as new (and hopefully better) companies are prevented from taking the loser’s place, leading to more economic inefficiency. The only way for loser’s to fail are for them to be really huge fuckups for hitting their break-point on super cheap debt and free money.\n\nIn my opinion, the Fed is overreacting and being a big baby about this. We’re going to see the bad scenario from QE almost immediately as those hurt by the lockdown won’t be able to participate in the asset price recovery.
