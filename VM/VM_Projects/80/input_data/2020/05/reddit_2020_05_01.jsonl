In 2000 and 2008 we seen the early 'Bear trap' sections of the bubble and then in the following decade we seen enthusiasm become greed and greed become delusion. The 30% gain in the S&P500 through the year 2019 was the final stages of this bubble.\n\nHere is a post describing us being in the ['Delusion' stage of the bubble in January of 2020](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/SPX/KY1p7aZa-50-Years-Could-End-in-Tears-for-US-Indices/).\n\nThe pop of this bubble and the following bear market will not be a nice fast one like the crashes of 2000 and 2008, it will be a more drawn out affair where prices drop far lower. The crash of the 2020's will be more like the crash of the 1930's depression. See the analysis [leading to this conclusion here.](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/03/01/us-indices-bubble-in-style-reflecting-the-great-depression-of-1930/)\n\nIn the months of January and February major US indices traded into the zone where a bubble template would be looking for the top to be made. Read about how this method has [worked in previous crashes here.](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/04/05/how-technical-analysis-has-signalled-previous-stock-market-highs-and-now-again-in-2020/) First forecasts in late January were mostly stopped out. There were losing signals on the Dow [around 29,300](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/DJI/RGkn3RjW-Dow-Jones-Crucial-Support-Levels-in-the-Week-Ahead/) and some in [February at 28,900](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/DJI/xWSFpsRi-Selling-Dow-28-900/). Individual stocks shorts done poorly, One exception was the Vanguard dividends index VYM. This did make it's high on the [exact price first posted.](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/VYM/BlWd0mFm-Popular-Vanguard-Has-High-Exposure-to-Bad-Market-Conditions/)\n\nIndividual stocks picks done particularly poorly in January. TSLA almost doubled from the first [shorting price of 510.](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/TSLA/FOs1PP5d-Tesla-Could-Breakdown-Soon/) Some did a bit better. [Like shorting T at 39.](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/T/IUgQyy8k-AT-T-Vulnerable-Debt-Cash-Flow-Leaks/)\n\nLater in February more sell signals were generated as price traded briefly over important resistance levels. If price broke back under these it would suggest market weakness. These were [170 on VTI](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/VTI/IPRCTQh9-VTI-Enters-the-Stubborn-Stage-of-a-Possible-Reversal/) and [29,000 on the Dow.](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/DJI/LiV4pmmH-Dow-Jones-Crucial-Downside-Break-Possible/) Once these levels were broken the bear market began. In the following days a signal for a [30% drop on the Dow Jones came](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/DJI/Cd6Il3np-Next-Series-of-Falls-Can-Take-Dow-Down-10-000-Points/) (and was successful).\n\nIndividual stock picks did much better in February. High prices were signalled in [MSFT](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/MSFT/LWCMh0jH-Microsoft-Setting-Up-For-Hard-Landing/), [BRK](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/BRK.A/bHDf6D7j-Buffet-s-the-King-of-the-Bag-Holders/), [SPCE](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/SPCE/uFAroqOi-SPCE-and-Gravity/), [GOOG](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/GOOG/m56g98mU-Weekly-Bearish-Butterfly-Pattern/). A high on [AMZN was called](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/AMZN/b4DOD5dy-The-Amazon-Bubble/), but price later traded higher. The best signal generated was a buy on the [TVIX from 34 to 800.](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/TVIX/ts9VcIlG-TVIX-Long-Term-Trend-Line-Break/)\n\nIn the month of March , 2020, the bubble popped. Most risk based assets and indices crashed over 30%. First analysis post said to [wait for a bounce to sell into](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/DJI/nVbfBVXn-Dow-Bounces-Like-a-Brick-While-Making-Big-Breakout/), but this was updated before the market opened to say prices could fall [8% and then 30% in March.](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/03/01/30-dow-jones-drop/) At this point the TradingView account was suspended. Only one account is allowed, and this was set up specifically for a 2020's bear market. So no further posts or updates were made there.\n\nOn the 3rd of March came the first signal to [look for the down move entering somewhere in the 16,000 - 18,000 area](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/03/16/dow-jones-enters-end-of-denial-stage-and-start-of-the-bull-trap/) on the Dow Jones. Followed by a post on the 16th of March saying [we're entering into the bull trap.](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/03/31/optimism-in-the-air-as-end-of-bull-trap-approaches/) The low on the Dow would be made around 18,250 on the 23rd of March. From here a rally began which has made a current high of 24,500.\n\nApril of 2020 has been the bull trap month. Some losing signals have been generated in the later couple weeks of April. A few calls on the top of the bull trap have been made. Prices have not went substantially higher, they've just not dropped. A forecast on the [17th of April marks the current high](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/04/16/17th-april-2020-the-bull-trap-completes/), but it looks like price can trade a bit higher. A post on the 19th of April calls for a crash in the S&P500 to [1,600 within the next 5 - 10 weeks](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/04/19/19th-of-april-here-comes-an-attitude-readjustment/).\n\nToday is the 25th of April. Over the last two weeks forecasts of a big drop starting have been inaccurate. I very strongly suspect this is akin to the sell signals generated in late January and early February.

A big housing indicator starts to creak.", "selftext": "Previous Post:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ga29ar/tea\\_leaves\\_pork\\_futures\\_and\\_chickens\\_running/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ga29ar/tea_leaves_pork_futures_and_chickens_running/) \n\nedit: linked the correct previous post because OP is bad at this. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, as we've discussed many times, housing is one of our big 3 indicators for systemic failure. The machine has started to creak a bit.\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/30/wells-fargo-says-it-will-no-longer-accept-applications-for-home-equity-lines-of-credit.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/30/wells-fargo-says-it-will-no-longer-accept-applications-for-home-equity-lines-of-credit.html)\n\nThis tells us that more of the riskier lines of loans are starting to dry up. Why is a HELOC (home equity line of credit) higher risk right now? Well, it inverses a bull market in that people taking a HELOC now are more likely to be doing so because they need money for basics, not luxuries. During a Bull market, banks might assume that people taking HELOCS are expanding or making themselves more valuable, and the bank is happy to takes its cut via interest. Banks now, meanwhile, want to hold on to as much liquidity as possible during uncertain times, to stay flexible.\n\nAs we've discussed before, recession/depressions do a unique thing to the loans/housing market.\n\nUnderlying Prices go down.\n\nMortgage rates go down.\n\nBUT, it gets harder, not easier, to get these good new loans/prices. One more way the poor get screwed.\n\nAs banks fight to conserve their liquidity, they'll naturally get more and more stringent on who they're willing to give loans to, because they need a guarantee that you're not about to lose your job and default on the money they give you. They don't want to end up owning homes that no one is paying for (because they'll have to) and it'll increase the encumbrance on their market nimbleness.\n\nWith a HELOC, they might surmise that you might already be in trouble, and that you're more likely to default on the new loan. If you're going to default anyways, they'd rather keep all their money, thanks. Almost sounds like the thing the Fed does where they give money to the companies that need it the least, and the little guy gets left out to dry...Hrm...Patterns... This is one more way the \"houses build wealth\" myth fucks you, in that its not always money when you really need it, because now you have lots of money you can't get to when you really need it.\n\nIf it were me, and I had a great credit score (800+), and I was looking, I absolutely wouldn't buy a damn thing right now. When housing collapses, you can pick up things for much much cheaper, as the vast majority of Americans (sub 800 credit scores) won't be able to buy anything. If you have a good enough down payment, you'll still be able to entice banks to take the risk on you, because you'll represent much less risk if you have enough liquidity to show you can put down 15% during a recession.\n\nSomething else I've noticed a bit of, is that we're getting a bit whippier, in that we're starting to see a bit more range in our nightly activity. Combine that with gaps, and it's got me interesting in playing nightly straddles again. Cause everyone likes positions and picture, below is a picture of my 'testing the waters\" position tonight. I picked it up at 330EST just as volatility was starting to pick up for end of day, so even as theta decayed (I bought a May 04 straddle) my premium, volatility helped keep its value high. I'll sell it first thing tomorrow morning, unless we're already in a big trend pushing my straddle more in the money. If we appear to be stable, or moving back towards my strike, I'll sell as soon as market opens. The other nice thing about buying right as volatility starts to open, while its still low, is that you can get your straddles closer to end of day strike pricing. This should give you a bit more money, because straddles are entirely based on how far the underlying moves from the straddle in the moment you buy it. You can skew a straddle if you think it'll go up or down, by buying a higher or lower straddle, but I personally prefer a neutral entry.\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/vTaMxf5.png](https://i.imgur.com/vTaMxf5.png)\n\nI payed 601.34 for the position, we'll see where our return is in the morning. If its strong, we'll prolly take a stronger stance tomorrow, as straddles can be extremely safe returns, and you don't have to be on either side of the \"MY POSITION IS FUCKED\" that plagues the daily thread after closing.\n\nStraddles allow you to take a much more aggressive stance on your bets, because even when you bet 100% of your position, you know that you're not capable of going bankrupt, and if you could place a bet with 50% of your position that you were 100% certain would profit, you absolutely would. The risk in the straddle is the decay of the premium, so if we think \"nothing\" will happen, we don't go in, but if \"nothing\" does happen, we're only going to eat the decay, and we'll get out as soon as we're able. When sizing your positions, size your loss-risk tolerance based on that.\n\nFor now, we're still waiting to see our indicators fail 'harder', but nothing so far has really given us a reason to doubt our outlook. I'll be starting to take some larger straddle positions on the overnight if things return well the next couple of nights, both  so that the incoming gaps can pay out, and in the event the fall of mankind starts at 3am before markets open, I'll still have tickets on the ride.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRemember when we said this could lead to war?\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/trump-threatens-use-of-tariffs-against-china-as-coronavirus-retaliation-2020-04-30](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/trump-threatens-use-of-tariffs-against-china-as-coronavirus-retaliation-2020-04-30)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe intelligence community already knows whats up:\n\n[https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-intelligence-agencies-say-coronavirus-originated-in-china-wasnt-man-madeor-genetically-modified-11588260228](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-intelligence-agencies-say-coronavirus-originated-in-china-wasnt-man-madeor-genetically-modified-11588260228)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd when we raised tariffs during the great depression?\n\n[https://www.thebalance.com/smoot-hawley-tariff-lessons-today-4136667](https://www.thebalance.com/smoot-hawley-tariff-lessons-today-4136667)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBe safe autists, lets try and safely pad things a bit before the ride takes off.\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/JYl4mBC.png](https://i.imgur.com/JYl4mBC.png)", "id": "gb7rgv", "created_utc": 1588292211.0, "score": 258, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 88, "comments": [{"body": "My nips....  they could cut glass right now.

So although they might pay a mortgage, they are actually making money on that money. They are also very nimble in the market, because usually they can flip out of those investment vehicles to pay off the house if necessary, or eat the loss on selling the house in the event it is no longer a good investment.\n \nThe mean salary in the united states is 53,490 per household\nThe average home price for a first time homebuyer is 218k in 2018\nThe average home price in general is 226k. \nThe average credit score for individuals 20-59 falls inside a FICO of 662-706, the \"good but nothing special\" range.\nThe average mortgage rates, apr,monthly payment and total interest paid for a 200k house for that credit range in 2019, assuming a 20% down payment: \n\n700–759\t3.63%\t$913\t $128,560\n\n680–699\t3.807%\t$933\t $135,776\n\n660–679\t4.021%\t$957\t $144,611\n\nBut the average down payment? Less than 6% for 55%+ of homebuyers\n\nSo what this means, is that people are getting into homes more and more that they're paying a bank for, not building significant equity in for many, many years. This leaves them victim to having to choose to either stay in the same area, and take the wage deflation that comes with being stuck, or give up that equity and re-start a new loan in a new location where the front-loaded interest payments on a new house in a new location to go after a higher salary still leave them paying a bank, and not themselves. With the average salaries really not providing a large buffer month-to-month, a mortgage ties people into vehicles that don't always appreciate at rates that beat even inflation. \n\nSimply put, when you buy a house, and an already wealthy person buy a house, its not the same game. \n\nNow take that same average salary, and put them in a much, much smaller home, that they pay mostly in cash for, and do all the fix-up for, etc etc, and then you start to build wealth.\n\nUnfortunately, the system is built to entice people to buy more than they can reasonably afford, and keep them chained to their monthly payments, because otherwise the current system can't float. \n\nIf you want to build wealth with home buying, buy very, very small to start with. Why? Because the moment your house is paid off, your salary increases by the entire amount of your mortgage, plus the equity appreciation rate of your house, plus the investment return rate of your money now that you can invest it directly into a vehicle that is worth it (which a small house generally is not, as it doesn't appreciate fast enough due to american financial education). \n\nIf you're already wealthy, saving a small very small % of your wealth per month isn't that helpful, so you find bigger vehicles.  \n\nIf you're not already wealthy, the % of your wealth saved will be much higher, making it a better return, but only if its truly being saved. Paying 80% of your monthly mortage rate to a bank on a frontloaded interest mortgage isn't saving anything. \n\nThis is why finance needs to be the most important thing you learn in grade school. If purchase isn't making you money, its a liability, not at asset. For the vast, vast majority of Americans, a house is a liability. \n\nhttps://www.thebalance.com/average-price-of-starter-home-4172916\nhttps://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_nat.htm\nhttps://www.businessinsider.com/cost-to-buy-a-house-in-every-state-ranked-2018-8\nhttps://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/what-is-the-average-credit-score-in-the-u-s/\nhttps://smartasset.com/mortgage/what-is-the-typical-down-payment-on-a-home-purchase", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I honestly appreciate your long explanations about why you think of it the way you do. I don't think we're going to agree - which is fine - and I'm not one for super long written pieces on the internet.\n\nI'll make this my last response, but again, thank you for the honest engagement.\n\nSo the first step (and the whole point) of getting rich is saving money. Saving more than you spend and having different vehicles to grow your money.\n\nPaying rent is throwing money away. It's paying for someone else's mortgage or profits. There isn't as much flexibility as renting, but there's zero savings. Mortgage costs can often be less than rent and act as a forced savings account which most folks aren't great at.\n\nHomes track with inflation country-wide and locally. This is why your grandparents paid $25,000 for their house that's worth $250,000 now (not real numbers, but you know what I mean).\n\nThe average home increase in value between 3-5% per year and it can be much more than that in high growth areas.\n\nHomes can be sold and upgraded tax free via a 1031 exchange. This allows you to pay zero capitol gains on an asset that could have appreciated substantially.\n\nYour argument changes part way through to people buying more sensibly instead of buying what the can barely pay for. Which is exactly the method they should go for. Buy something you can easily afford and pay it off as soon as possible. My argument is it's one of the best ways for a non-wealthy person to become wealthy. Having an asset like a home allows you to either not pay rent or to make money off someone else renting - all while the asset grows in value.\n\nTo place the personal choice of how much house to buy at the feet of the banking institutions is silly. Nobody is forcing them to buy at their max limit. Of course the systems entice them, just as food is meant to be enticing and some folks over eat. It's a personal choice and each person (if they intend to grow wealthy) needs to show restraint.\n\nI wish that mortgage companies didn't stack the deck 80% in their favor, but they have to hedge their own risks on lending out money. That's why you should buy less than you can afford and pay it off as soon as possible.\n\n\"If you're already wealthy, saving a small very small % of your wealth per month isn't that helpful, so you find bigger vehicles.\" I haven't personally found that to be true. If it's a net positive, it's positive.  Particularly because it can be a net positive in the short term and a huge positive in the longer term once the house is paid off.\n\nLike I said, we probably won't agree, but that's why I think they're the best path.\n\n[https://www.zillow.com/research/zillow-home-value-appreciation-5235/](https://www.zillow.com/research/zillow-home-value-appreciation-5235/)\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/23/how-much-housing-prices-have-risen-since-1940.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/23/how-much-housing-prices-have-risen-since-1940.html)", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}
