{"title": "Where the market is headed and why...plus virus update", "selftext": " I'll reiterate these are just my opinions, but all of the numbers or stats I mention are correct from sources like WSJ, Bloomberg, NYT etc. plus individual research.\n\nThe virus:\n\nAs Im sure you've seen recently there has been a lot of media coverage on Remdesivir, the first possible therapeutic for COVID. I have seen various different claims to how effective it is, from Gilead the maker to obscure media outlets like STAT which originally reported it was very effective at wiping out the virus. The WHO leaked the results of a study from China last week that claimed there was no statistical significance between patients who were given a regimen of the drug, and those who werent. This study was double-blind, and had a control group, but was smallish with only I believe around 100 participants. The WHO then pulled this article from their site shortly after it went up. Days later, the official report from China was released the morning of the GDP drop of the month of March which came in at -4.8%, the biggest drop since 2009.  \n\nFunnily enough, that same morning both the GDP report and the small China study were released for Remdesivir, Gilead came out saying that a study in the US patients given the drug resulted in a drop of hospitalization time from 14 days to 11 days, with ~50% of patients improving who had severe results. This covered up the China story quickly. The market jumped 3% and it was blasted on all media outlets that this was the first therapeutic. The flaw in this study was there was no control group, so in my opinion it is nearly impossible to measure how succesful the drug was. It was also not coincidence that this news dropped the same day as the official China study came out. I remain skeptical at how good this drug will turn out to be, but there are much larger studies set to be released in the coming weeks. There are also over 200 different therapies and vaccine trials going on worldwide. Without getting too far into detail, Bill Gates sees 7-10 vaccine trials as being very hopeful with a timeframe of 9-18 months. I personally believe it will be by the end of the year we have a good vaccine option or therapeutic with 90% + effectiveness that will only be available for emergency use. Gates sees the logistics of making billions of drug doses safely as the larger challenge, and that taking longer than expected because it's literally never been done. \n\nIn terms of the latest research about mortality and contagion, it seems that the R-naught (how many people you spread the virus to once you are infected) is much higher than anticipated. Bill Gates seems to think it's around 5. So for every one person who gets it, you give it to 5 people if left unmitigated. Obviously an exponential curve. The reason its so difficult to contain is because how much of a \"viral load\" you are exposed to determines how symptomatic you are, and how sick you get- for the most part. There are reports of people having very high loads and not being symptomatic. Again a reason why its so difficult to track. Social distancing has reduced this R-naught in nearly every state to below 1 or to about 0.8 in most places, which is maintained the virus would eventually fizzle out slowly. Unfortunately, the minute restrictions are lifted the number will rise possibly to above 1 and you will see cases start to climb exponentially again. A great website that illustrates this I've linked here: https://rt.live/\n\nMortality is tricky because it is so biased on age. It seems that the mortality rate on average will be much lower than the ~5% current US statistics report. This is because the denominator for the calculation is likely between 10-50 times larger depending on location than reported cases. An antibody study for NY saw that around 20% of the population has had the virus already. My guess is places where outbreaks are bad the numbers are much higher than reported, and places where numbers are low the reported cases are much more accurate. In all likelihood we will never know the actual number. The death rate for young healthy people without underlying conditions is about 0. The death rate for anyone around 40 without underlying conditions is close to 0, and anyone above 40 with underlying conditions it is pretty dangerous to risk going out. About 95% of the cases are considered \"mild\", but mild cases are like the worst flu you've ever had, and the symptoms last for weeks. Also new reports suggest not only does this ravage the lungs, but it can also cause permanent heart and brain damage for unknown reasons. People have reported upticks in seizures after getting the virus. All in all not great. \n\nI believe we are past the biggest peak of cases if things continue as they have been, but opening up will cause there to be more peaks to come. Probably we will have limited opening and closing of much of the economy all over the country at different points until we have herd immunity or a breakthrough in medicine. The best visual I've seen is a sinusoidal wave that has lower peak to troughs as time goes on. The Y axis being new cases, the X being time. The one anomaly that gives me hope is Sweden which has not locked down but it seems slowly gained/gaining herd immunity. A more likely scenario for the US is Singapore, which is now undergoing strict lockdowns after an initial first wave- they are in the second. What I see is indisputable at this point is we won't ever go back to a complete normal until a vaccine or a 95% + therapeutic. \n\nThe economy\n\nThe last email I sent on March 22nd I mentioned now was the first time I'd buy into the market since the peak for certain companies based on how steep the drop was. By sheer luck, it was the day before the market bottomed on March 23rd. If you had bought some of the stocks that I suggested on the day of the email (which not even I did all of them) most of the companies are up around ~50% with some like Chipotle and some of the hotel and cruise stocks up about ~100% since just 5 weeks ago. Now, I believe we are on the other side of where we were, which is absurdly overbought. Let me explain why. \n\nAs I mentioned last time, there were multiple enormous stimulus packages that were released during the past five weeks. The fed successfully backstopped the credit and equity markets from completely collapsing, which would have happened if they didn't flood an unprecedented amount of liquidity into both markets. \n\nOn a daily basis for the past few weeks the fed has bought around $70 billion of credit, more than entire months of the last few years. They have slowly waned off of this ridiculous buying, but what it did besides stabalize markets is completely disconnect market fundamentals from prices. This is why we have seen an over 60% retracement of the initial drop in the stock market the past month. I believe this is now over, and I am taking a leap to say the peak of the rally was last Thursday. I could be wrong, but from a technical perspective a number of indicators say Thursday might've been it. I am suggesting if you are in stocks that have had a significant updraft since the lows of the past few weeks, I would sell into strength. Despite the unprecedented measures of monetary and fiscal stimulus brought on by the government, and the media headlines of the 'new bull market', the government can only support, not supplant consumer demand. \n\nEstimates of corporate earnings continue to rocket downwards, and the most recent GDP estimate for Q2 is between 30-40% decline. This is not on an annualized basis, but then you need to consider the rebound which is why the market has recovered so much- all hope that the recovery will be V shaped. I believe the recovery wont be nearly as fast as the market has priced in, which is a V. Trump seems to be on this side which has promoted what I consider false hope in many. Even if there is a relatively fast medical breakthrough, 30 million people are now unemployed, with the actual number likely 20% or more higher than 30 million. This means that every single job since the financial crisis' peak unemployment is now gone. 30 million people is 18% of the labor force. Many of these jobs might be temporary layoffs, but the labor participation rate has been declining since the 90s. And with the government's generous $600 a week unemployment check plus state unemployment, anyone making less than $15 an hour would be making less working than sitting at home. In other words, the government is incentivizing companies to lay off workers. These benefits will likely go into 2021, greatly slowing the economic recovery. Also, most small restaurants and consumer businesses cannot sustainably be open at 25% capacity. It is more economically viable to stay closed with no expenses other than rent and utilities than be open paying employees more than $15 an hour at 1/4 capacity with 1/4 tips. \n\nThe market \n\nWe have retraced and bounced off of the 61% level, an important level many people trade on. We also broke the uptrend from the past few weeks, and were trading on ever thinning volume. Additionally, Buffet's favorite market indicator tracking market-cap/GDP is at an all-time high. The market is also extremely top heavy, meaning 5 companies make up more than 20% of the total S&P market cap. Commodities are also tanking, with oil below 20$ a barrel, hitting -40 last week for a day. The last time all of these conditions were in place while the market ticked every higher on hope was the 2001 internet bubble. This is where it gets interesting, if you werent already riveted by this rambling mess of an email. \n\nDuring the market crash, 7/10 retail market participants (us) didnt motify their positions at all. Of the 3 that did, the vast majority actually added stocks, only 16% sold them. One of the key indicators of a market bottom is capitulation, when everyone thinks it'll never end. The market bottoms when there is no one else left to sell. 16% selling doesn't sound like capitulation to me. \n\nLooking at fundamentals, the forward-12 months earnings for the aggregate S&P has been falling precipitously over the past few weeks with the consensus is around $125 a share, a 30% drop from pre-coronavirus levels. This is how much earnings dropped in 2008, and I think this drop will be worse overall so in my opinion it is a conservative estimate. Multiplying that by the average P/E ratio of the past 50 years you get 2,100 for the S&P. Multiplying it by a more realistic number you get 1800. We are trading at ~2850 as of close Friday. This would give an implied P/E forward looking ratio of ~23, the second highest in history after the 2001 bubble. I don't think we will hit 1800 as of now because of what the fed has done, but it isn't out of the question. Many highly regarded investors like Scott Minerd, Jeff Gundlach, and Ray Dalio agree. Minerd sees a worst-case of 1500 for the S&P. \n\nIn summay, I believe we are at the peak of a long term debt cycle. I believe the levels of debt accumulated during this crisis will inhibit investment from consumers and corporations for years to come. 40% of Americans couldn't afford an unexpected expense of $400 without taking on debt before this crisis- during the longest economic expansion in US history. Over the past decade the recovery was the slowest ever since WWII, and the interest rates never got above 2.5% historically very very low, which begs the question why was it so slow? This will change consumer behavior like the Great Depression did, hopefully for the better. But the enormous government responses globally will also fundamentally change how the world operates. Printing money at billions a week is not sustainable, and inflation will occur at some point. For now, the dollar is in such high demand we are likely to see a sustained period of delation, which further hurts an economic recovery and investment. Why would you hire a new employee now if it will cost you less in the future- deflation. I know this sounds doom and gloom, but it's not meant to be. Buffet had his annual meeting today and said America will get through this, and I totally agree. It's just I believe this is a 9/11 or great depression type event that will change our behavior in ways that we don't know yet. Honestly, in the long run probably positively.

Then again Tesla is the second most valuable car company in the world worth $150 billion and its stock is up 70% for the year, and it had income of $16 million the last quarter- so maybe money does grow on trees.

Them pulling out of short selling back at the trough has gotten middle america to rush in as gold is to expensive for a stimmie check but silver you can feel rich buying several dozen ounces.\n\nLooking forward on their monthlies there is extreme call interest in the 21-30 range and while a fair amount of puts in the 20-25 range, between the theta they sell and particularly with the spot price pumps getting more people to FOMO while simulatenously increasing volatility again raising premium higher; haven't crunched the numbers but as it stands current with the call to puts they'd make a low 9 figures over the next two and a half months not including expected options buying which I can not properly extrapolate if they get it down to 22ish. Given they have about 30000 tons of silver and this years appears to be a net wash in terms of silver production/consumption but a lot of uncertainty, that \\~25 billion\\~ worth of silver (at current prices) plus SLV shares equivalent can be readily converted into a very safe billion+ plus a year while being good for their books by having a tangible asset despite the fact we both know if they dumped 30000 tons of silver on the market it'd be worth only a couple dollars an ounce.\n\nSo yeah, two month projection as it stands now is 23ish SLV etf price based on price pinning expectation but could definitely change if market sentiment switches to more puts which could raise the target.  Seems like to me with your weekly SLV theta strategy you can adjust a bit and base it off of sentiment, and go a full strike or three under if call sentiment is high as JP will oblige and crash the spot price thus SLV's underlying.  It's essentially what you're doing when you write puts via the RSI as you know JP will oblige and raise the price of the spot.\n\n You can check out today's options with the most volume and see it lines up with SLV's highs and lows and how the majority of people who bought contracts today got absolutely fucked, as well as about one week ago.  Current sentiment puts SLV's price at about 2.5/24 for next week but there was an uptick in puts compared to last two weeks average so will have to monitor as that might raise it back to the 25/25.5 level.\n\nI would also say the best way to profit play futures and go long/short any fifty cent increase or decrease from the strike price of max pain, buying an additional contract each deviation (using a rough standard of silver  spot = two bucks more than slv etf, also obvious to whatever scale of capital you're willing to commit) while watching option sentiment and adjusting fire with a fifteen minute candle to target entry/exit points over any four hour trading window.  This manipulation will also lead to firm resistance points as JP likely trades with itself as I scalped the 26.6 mark today twice today which was equal to the profits I made shorting it this entire week prior.\n\nProbably a bit much but using this post to write my thoughts down on a week of full silver spot trading and it's been an interesting one to say the least.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "\"heavily manipulated\" do you have any proof or evidence at all?

{"title": "The Big Hedge: How to cover your ass so you never have to live in mom's basement", "selftext": "**TL;DR**: Options trading gives you a tool to protect yourself from massive downside risk in the event that the company you work for/sector you work in goes tits up. Use options as a form of cheap insurance for your job.\n\nFirst, I'll point you to [an excellent WSB thread on hedging for options trading](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fn5f4p/hedging_for_autists/). You don't need to read it to understand my point, but I want you to take away these key points.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Options accomplish 2 primary things:  \n>  \n>*They allow us to control for downside risk, similar to buying car insurance* for your speed demon of a wife. When you buy puts you are protecting yourself from losses if your long position goes tits up.  \n>  \n>They allow us to leverage our existing assets for greater returns. Similar to renting out your condo to buy more rental condos, you can \"rent out\" stocks that you own by selling covered calls or puts, a concept we will discuss further down. This is where Theta gang get their tendies.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The strategy** I have for you is simple: Buy way OTM puts dated a year or more into the future on your company. Roll them over to a later date either quarterly or annually. In the event of a systemic shock that destroys your company, you pay yourself a fat unemployment check. If your company is too small to buy LEAPS on, find another company or two in the same industry to buy the puts on.\n\nMathematically, the goal is to spend about 1% of your annual income on these puts in such a way that if your employer collapses you secure 25% of your annual income to fall back on. If the market is efficient, this bet should pay off about 1 in 25 years. Since the business cycle lasts about 9 years, this means that you are hedging that your employer is specifically affected by an overall downturn in about one in three business cycles and gives insurance against less systemic risks that might destroy them.\n\nYou should calculate the correct strikes yourself for your employer, but a good heuristic is that a one year put 15%-25% OTM will have the correct properties. Volatile companies will have more expensive options, and therefore will require more capital to secure a potential payout of several months salary. But they are volatile for a reason and that reason likely impacts the odds you will continue having a job so the more expensive insurance is warranted.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nConsider these made up **anecdotes** about Frank, a Boeing plant worker, and Tom, an Enron regional energy operations manager.  The option premiums are my best estimates based off of experience buying/selling LEAPS. If you have historical premiums data I would love to see it.\n\nFrank gets paid $60k a year at Boeing. He's started making this bet every year since he started working for Boeing in 2010 after losing his construction job during the 2008 recession. At $600/year for insurance he has paid out $6000 so far. He rebalances his one put contract on 01/01/2020 paying $6/share for 2021 puts at $285 strike (\\~13% OTM). $BA hasn't been very volatile lately so the premiums are cheap. The Wuhan plague hits and $BA plunges to a low of $90. Frank sells the contract for $200/share benefiting additionally from the pump in IV. Frank makes a little under $20k on this trade which is 4 months pay. He nets $14k on the trade considering the amount he spent during previous years. Frank feels no anxiety about losing his job when the plant gets shutdown.\n\nTom gets paid $400k a year at Enron. He knows some shady stuff happens at Enron, but that happens at all the energy firms he thinks. Tom has been playing this strategy since he started working for Enron in '88. He made some money on it during an energy shock in the 90's but only enough to cover 2 years of option premiums. He rolls over his $4,000 worth of contracts in January 2001 when Enron is trading at $80, buying 12 contracts with a strike at $60 because Enron volatility has been high for $3.30/share. Later that year the Enron scandal is uncovered and the stock price collapses to $0 before the year is over. Tom makes $72k. Net after previous years is therefore $28k. He can pay the mortgage on his new and fugly Texas McMansion while he looks for a job.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Of course, the best strategy for keeping your job is to be excellent at what you do*. You can't control everything though so it pays to be prepared. If you worry that your job may ever be on the line, then this strategy is for you. It's a good way to harness the degenerate things you've learned at WSB to make sure you can sleep easy at night.\n\nEdit: Also compensation in company stock is a scam unless you're an exec who gets to make buyback decisions.

{"title": "Big Tech Waving the Rainbow Flag", "selftext": "It should be well known that FAANGM is dominating the S&P index weight at over 21%.  The combination of this dominance and the insulated nature of their business models have led to a lot of frustration for anyone running TA on the SPX during the recent rally.  With the risk of earnings behind us on big tech, lets take a look at how these bad boys are looking and what the implications are for the broader market.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[AMZN Daily](https://preview.redd.it/l59fkfoj7mw41.png?width=1418&format=png&auto=webp&s=4fefb7961f5afa7b1a314e8c8e4427b7b232fc49)\n\nThere was a ton of speculation on AMZN going into earnings, but it is time for this baby to check back to the 2,000 - 2,200 range.  This would be a healthy pull back after the breakout to new highs, but would put a dent in the SPX performance.  MACD crossed over on Friday.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[MSFT Daily](https://preview.redd.it/dfztu9s99mw41.png?width=1418&format=png&auto=webp&s=65341521aa5cf30f6b296b5b8a6c14b95da2fc0e)\n\nMSFT broke its uptrend a couple weeks ago, but hung on as it has an insulated business model and (IMO) if you are an index fund you couldn't afford to miss a breakout on earnings due to the contribution.  With earnings out and MACD waning after the double top at 180, I'm betting on a move back down to the 50 day MA.  Again, a pretty standard check back, but the 7% move down will weigh on the index thanks to the 5.7% weight in the SPY.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[AAPL Daily](https://preview.redd.it/1eqk7rqyamw41.png?width=1418&format=png&auto=webp&s=eaa9be1af319c90f4db71eb299f92340746721ad)\n\nAAPL, similar to MSFT, broke the uptrend a couple weeks ago, but was bid up into earnings.  With that behind us there is room for a healthy correction back to the 50 day MA at \\~270.  That is a 6.5% move down with an over 5% weight in the SPY.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[SPX Daily](https://preview.redd.it/q759igkjdmw41.png?width=1418&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e70f5bef509a47100dd297c730bebbb35f7568b)\n\nTo tie things together, the rolling over of big tech could drive the S&P down to the 50 day MA of \\~2,740.  If momentum to the downside picks up, we could see \\~2,640.  \n\n**TL/DR:**  Market sentiment has been influenced by big tech, so look for big tech to signal the next leg down.  With earnings out, technicals are turning negative, which removes the positive influence on broader market.  Tech is likely to outperform throughout this recession, but this increases the probability for downside moves on the names that are truly getting bent over.    \n\n**Positions:** SPXS, SPYp 5/15 +270/-260,  XLFp 6/19 +20/-18, ZMp 8/21 +130/-100, XLEp 6/19 35", "id": "gczbyf", "created_utc": 1588543856.0, "score": 160, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 82, "comments": [{"body": ">\t~~FAANGM~~\n\nFAGMAN", "score": 378, "replies": [{"body": "Mods.

I go long on things that meet three criteria: good long-term oriented leadership(don't like anything that even has a whiff of pump like buybacks), good technology/portfolio/support/and moats, and finally the numbers make sense (pe ratios , historical performance, marketshare, margin, etc).

There technology also makes sense and I think provides true benefit to smaller residential solar systems. The bad though is pretty big. They are too small right now, this means they will not have the leverage of larger comoanies so in the upcoming component shortages they will be crushed and desperate for parts. They are too young and do not have a proven track record. There current valuation is too large for there current size and volume they will need to grow to a significantly larger size before they deserve that valuation and hardware just doesn't scale as fast as software plain and simple.
