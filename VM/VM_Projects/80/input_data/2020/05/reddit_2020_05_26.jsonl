(Nothing worse than having a Long Put or a Long Call that you bought when IV was higher (like before earnings) and then IV crushes and so selling it back will have less premium...which means you might have to pay more to close it, than what you paid for it, ouch.\n\n So when Paper trading, put on the same trade at different expirations and strikes, copy the greeks and each day, look to see how they change. Then when you have a feel for how each one changes during up and down moves, then practice adding adjustments. \n\nSpreads can protect you if it changes direction...for example, a Bull Put is a Long Put (you pay) under a Short Put (You receive money but you have the obligation to buy if called out, and can get called out at any time... so do NOT do a short put if you don't have the cash to buy the shares) \n\nThe difference in what you received on the Short Put and paid for the Long Put is your profit potential....but here is a little trick...If you want the stock anyways and it slips down below your SP AND your LP, then you are now making money on that LP, which can be a beautiful thing because you would close LP on expiration, you get assigned those shares but your cost basis is quite a bit lower. Shares = $50 - SP (2.50)= cost basis is 47.50...then whoa-ho...you closed on expiration the lp that was like 3.50 cuz stock price moved below,...so now $47.50 - 3.50 = cost basis of $44. \n\nOnce you get the shares, you can turn around and put on a Short Call for anything 44 or even below and you can STilL MAKE money if shares go down. It's like getting paid to rent the stocks...rinse repeat. \n\nTrick here is to know your stocks Dailey movement tendencies. Put the Bull Put on when stock is near the low of the day...and if selling a Short Call to get rid of the stock, put that SC on when stock hits the higher part of the day.\n\nDO KEEP in MIND, that a Short call CAN be called out ON expiration Weekend even if the stock price closed above your SP strike price...So if you have $950 profit and you would miss 12-20 bucks to close it, but you feel like the stock could go up so you wouldn't mind keeping stocks, but love that extra cash...then CLOSE the SC. Ask me how I know, lol (esp on something like Tesla...not fair? ya but we already know its all manipulated so learn the game and play it well.)\n\nLots to learn...lots of different strategies, so don't rush it. Maybe just start with Bull Puts to acquire shares, and then practice covered calls to sell.\n\nIts exciting, it can be very flexible, and this is probably the hardest market right now to try to learn, lol.
