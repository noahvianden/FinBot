This handles the part where you don't know when drop can come and will let your puts fluctuate a bit without being killed by theta. They'll be more expensive (maybe 500-1k apiece) but that's the price of not buying FD's\n\n\nStep 2) use long puts as collateral, sell near-exp (like 2-3 days left max til exp) puts that are either same or lower strike than your long put. The long puts you purchased for $1k can serve in the place of ~30k cash that would otherwise be needed as collateral to sell a put. \n\n\nStep 3) When theta kills your sold short put(s), either buy them back on exp day if it looks like they might go ITM, or if they're doomed, just let em expire.\n\n\nStep 4) now that your long puts are no longer serving as collateral, repeat steps 2-3 for next upcoming exp day. \n\n\nStep 5) if/when SPY does and up taking a dive, worst case scenario is you were just at the \"sell FD puts\" step and just sold some that are now climbing along with your long put, which remember, should be climbing as well. Should this happen, you can either buy back the short put at a loss if you think you caught it before the end of the drop, or if it's dropped and flattened already, close out using a calendar spread (buy back the sold out (at a loss) *and* sell you long put at same time (for what should be a nice gain). \n\n\n\n\n\n\nA few things I've particular liked about this strategy and why I think it fits a small cap account like our shitty ones:\n\n\n -- Skirts frustration of running out of day trades: because you'll only be buying the long term puts only ever so often, and the more immediate profits will be watching sold near-exp puts tank on theta. Thus unlike the many times I (and possibly you) have seen a call or put we bought rise up to $500+ profit on a day we can't close it, only to barely break even the next day cuz it got theta raped and you just had to sit there helpless, now you have theta working to your advantage. If a sold put tanked on a day you couldn't sell it, not like it'll suddenly be worth $100 more just because a new trading day started - in fact the opposite - your profilt will jump overnight with the theta decay. \n\n\n --  way less stress about your long put with an expiration date that lets you breathe a bit and not have to hope spy moves a specific way by the end of the week or day.\n\n\n-- minimal capital needed as an investment ($1-2k) to empower you to sell Puts\n\n\n-- if you make sure your long puts are nicely ITM (mine are 300 strike), the puts you'll be selling will likely be at lower strikes to make sure they expire cheap/worthless, so worst case, you'll still recoup some money if you get assigned, as your long put will enable you to sell the shares for a higher strike than the sold put that was assigned\n\n\ngood luck dude", "score": 8, "replies": []}, {"body": "2500 on UVXY calls + 2500 on slightly otm SPY puts = euphoric inducing returns", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Uvxy is like fire, not as bad as vxx tho", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I'd go theta gang for a few weeks, have some short term Iron Condors on SPY, then as we get closer, change to call credit spreads and use that to funds puts.\n\nThen move to all puts, ride it down, then near the bottom, sell puts until IV goes down.\n\nThen IC the (presumably slow) recovery - or buy stonks in units of 100 to collateralize selling more puts.", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "theres no way there wont be a couple more market crashes with the state of the economy right now and it may very well happen at the start of june.
