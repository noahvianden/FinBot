{"title": "The Bearish Case for the Stock Market", "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\nThe S&P500 is only down 12% from its all time high in early 2020 and is greater than its average in 2019. The S&P500 Index closed today at 2,972. In 2019 the S&P500 averaged to be 2,913. In 2018 and 2017 it averaged 2,746 and 2,449, respectively. \n\nFor those bulls who want to buy stocks now, you must have been going crazy buying stocks in 2019 and even crazier in 2018, and 2017. Many people were saying stocks were overvalued (or at least a bit frothy in 2019), but now (going into the most cataclysmic economic event of our lifetimes), it is a good time to buy??\n\nHere is my bearish case for stocks:\n\n* The economy is being kept afloat right now by insane debt forbearance, money printing and stimulus spending. If a individual or business cannot pay make loan payments. No worries. They will just be deferred. Everyone gets a $1,000 check from the government. Uncle Sam will pay the wage costs for all businesses for 10 weeks. Many Americans are making a lot more $$$ on unemployment then they did from their jobs. You can't pay rent? Well your landlord does not have to pay his mortgage so that can wait. This will wear off. A lot of it will be re-upped. However, the economy is in recession  right now even with this massive stimulus. This is the end of a long economic expansions and people have decent savings and are fine. It is only down hill from here.\n* There will be pain once defaults start happening. We will not escape this recession without some pain. Banks and Financial Institutions will not want to lend or invest into uncertainty. Credit markets will dry up which will squeeze the economy. \n* Its going to get more expensive for many businesses to operate with safety restrictions. Profits will be more difficult to come by. Retail, restaurants, travel and leisure will take a huge hit. Autos probably will too. Businesses are not going to have there employees travel (stay at hotels, take planes, eat at restaurants) in 2020. People are not going to go out like they used too (the bartender wearing a face mask just kills the vibe).\n* Businesses will be forced to make cuts. Unemployment will lead to lost wages and the recession/depression spiral will develop.\n* I expect the FED to go through unprecedented measures to keep the economy afloat. But there will be economic pain.\n* Who knows how long it will take to get a vaccine? It could be one or two years or longer. We hear about companies making progress, but companies have the incentive to do that to increase their valuation.\n* What if there is a second out break? The virus is out there and it quickly went from 1 case in the USA to shutting everything down. \n* Even with insane FED spending, the economy will be in worse shape the virus goes away because all the debt, inflation, ect. Companies will have to pay more taxes to pay debt, the government will have to reduce the deficit (government spending is much less than 2019 and 2018). If there is inflation well that is a tax too, because everything is more expensive.\n\nMy questions is why by stocks now? Do you think the S&P500 is going to increase 12% to its all time high? Then what. Is it going to increase 100% once the virus goes away?\n\nThe economy has been so good for so long, that people have forgotten that companies can lose money. It is not just \"I struck out this time at bat, I'll do better next time I'm up\". If you can't pay your debt, the companies goes under (or has to shave assets to stay alive...a recession is not the best time to be a \"forced seller\"). If you cannot pay your employees you have to lay them off. A company may be relying on cash flow from operations to invest back in their business t continue their growth. If you are a company with \"growth potential\" your funders may no longer investing more money which leads to tough decisions. \n\nI welcome thoughts from Bulls and Bears. I shared my opinion for discussion so I can hear feedback and form a more complete view. I have no interest in calling Bulls stupid.

It simply isn’t going to happen. If we were to shutdown again in the fall, economic markets would plummet into the earth off of the uncertainty alone. Consumer behavior would also become incredibly cautious. Consumer discretionary spending would be almost non-existent as people focus their money more on essential items and rainy day savings even more than they already are. All of the jobs that were temporarily furloughed would likely turn into permanent losses. The ripple effects from this would reach every corner of the economy. It would also mean that the current administration would have to eat crow and admit they were wrong. It would mean throwing in the re-election towel once and for all. \n\nIt’s for all of these reasons, the last one particularly, that you will not see another economic shutdown. I think what you will see instead is a government and an economy that puts its blinders on and keeps trudging up the hill of economic reopening and recovery whether there is a second outbreak or not. This horse is only going one direction, and that’s forward. At this point, what you’ll be fighting against more than anything is consumer sentiment. And believe you me, every company in America is about to spend every dime of advertising money to convince the American public that their stores and restaurants are safe. The U.S. government will tow their end of that line as well. \n\nAt the end of the day, I agree with you.

Without this federal support, their local economies will spiral out of control. It doesn’t matter how you spin it, as a governor you don’t get to come back from that.

Right now, we have two bad options and zero good ones:\n\n1) Keep the economy shutdown and/or shutdown again in the fall. The economy simply won’t be able to take that hit. We’ll spiral straight into a Great Depression that will take a decade or more to recover from. We’re not just talking about a bunch of filthy rich hedge fund managers, investors, and wealthy businessmen losing some cash. We’re talking about tens of millions of people losing their jobs and being plunged into poverty and homelessness. The effects that unemployment has go far beyond just financial. Suicide and depression rates go up. People stop going to the doctor because they don’t have the money. People stop taking their medications because they can’t afford them. Unemployment literally kills people. For every 1% unemployment goes up, 37,000 people die. If unemployment reaches great depression levels, you’re talking about nearly 1 million deaths - ten times the current U.S. coronavirus deaths. All of that poverty and poor health will then ripple through families for generations to come. \n\n2) Open the economy and take the risk that COVID-19 takes off like wildfire and kills 3% of the population. Whether or not it actually does this is still a big question mark. With social distancing, mask wearing, more stringent sanitation protocols, ramped up testing, contact tracing, and antibody tests, we will likely be able to significantly curb the spread of the virus even as economic activity resumes. People forget that the whole point of this shutdown was not to “stop” the spread of the virus, only slow it down enough to avoid overloading our healthcare system, which we have done. You can’t just keep that whole country shutdown for 12 months. That simply won’t work. \n\nSo, what you’re left with is choosing between a course of action that is guaranteed to have disastrous results versus one that may or may not have disastrous results. Neither option has good odds, but the shutdown option has a guaranteed set of poor results while the reopening option has some sliver of hope in it.

Thanks u/831sweatyfeet\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis will get deleted I'm sure.  But u/formerbuck made a big DD the other day, and garnered a significant amount of followers.  I only went as far as to follow his post, and try to see if his angle was correct.  It was not, and he has proceeded to delete his entire post, and comment history.  I don't know that he was mean spirited and purposefully wanted people to follow him in to the ditch, but I know he took a few people down with him.\n\nWatch who you follow, and trust.  In fact don't trust anyone here, in fact if you have any less a clue than I of what you are doing, just stop.  Or don't, it's on you tho.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: grammar and syntax\n\nEDIT2:\n\n5/27 SPY c$306\n\n5/29 HPQ c$18\n\n6/19 SPY p$245\n\n7/17 GE c$8", "id": "gn3x2n", "created_utc": 1589945770.0, "score": 48, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 81, "comments": [{"body": "Sir, this is the internet.", "score": 47, "replies": [{"body": "Sometimes people need reminding.", "score": 26, "replies": []}, {"body": "If everything on the internet is true, how is his information false?", "score": 5, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "what bag did he leave u holding?", "score": 26, "replies": [{"body": "A big one apparently", "score": 9, "replies": []}, {"body": "Nothing.
