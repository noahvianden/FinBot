This means that in order for a brokerage to agree to lend you 100 shares of stock x you have to give them ($13 per share) $1300. So suddenly instead of investing $4000 to own 100 shares you only paid 1300. However, this means in order for you to make a profit, when you sell the price of stock X needs to be $53+ so that you can cover the premium without taking a loss.
