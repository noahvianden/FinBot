Antibody testing's reliability has been questioned as well.\n\nData - This is where I disagree most with you. The majority of economic data has been terrible. Even the data you're citing here I don't think is good news. 90% of layoffs temporary = furloughs to get PPP $. That chart from Redfin is literally just \"interest\" in buying. People hear that rates are very low and believe it's a good time to buy. What they don't realize is banks are only making mortgage loans to QMs with 20% down right now. The social programs will end and with fewer people working and paying tax, who knows how it gets paid off. \n\nFed - Does not give a shit about individual equity prices, just that the market functions properly.\n\nIndicators - Plenty of bad ones too. Just Google \"credit downgrade\" and click the news tab, for example.\n\nTechnicals - And high tide is tomorrow morning. This is a massive and unprecedented macroeconomic event so I wouldn't put too much faith in that long term.\n\nI think you're riding a lot of weird and unprecedented things into this bullish trend that explains some of it as well in the short term.
