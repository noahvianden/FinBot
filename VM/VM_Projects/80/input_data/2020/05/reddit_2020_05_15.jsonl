{"title": "Firstrade sold my position without my permission", "selftext": "My story is not as bad as the questrade one, but this is a heads-up for anyone who uses Firstrade's level 3 margin account.\n\nI never go into margins due to my low risk appetite, and I generally own various stocks and sell cash secured put options. On May 1st, I received a notification saying that one of the 4 BA cash secured puts was bought to close with a loss. I was baffled since I did not recall making an order, and I have enough cash to buy the stocks so it couldn't have been the system forcing me to close. After waiting in line for 2 hours to get the customer service person on the phone (yep, that's the standard for Firstrade), I was informed that Firstrade's system sold my position but they are not sure why, they need to \"clear things up\" with the clearing firm, and that I should apply for level 4 margin account to prevent the same thing from happening again. After losing their client's money due to a mistake, Firstrade's response is essentially \"increase your risk appetite to prevent losing more money\".\n\nI asked for a follow-up and waited for two weeks with no news, so I eventually called and asked for the manager. After speaking to several clueless reps and being put on hold for several 30-minute chunks, I finally got to speak to the head of Firstrade's trading desk, who proceeded to repeat the same gibberish about how they are not sure what happened, they will take more time to investigate it if I want, and I should either downgrade the margin account to level 2 which does not allow verticals or upgrade it to level 4. As to the prospect of getting compensated for the loss incurred by Firstrade's \"not-sure-how-it-happened\" mistake? That they are sure is not gonna to happen.\n\nIn the end I lost 80 from the puts and 400 from the opportunity cost, but this experience indicated to me that **Firstrade is not a trust-worthy broker and could potentially lose their clients lots of money while having \"no idea how it happened\"**. I currently have my play money with them but will move it somewhere else once I close my positions.\n\nTldy: Firstrade closed my cash-secured puts without my permission, refused to compensate me for the loss, and pushed me to apply for higher level margin account as their \"solution\".", "id": "gkisbe", "created_utc": 1589581046.0, "score": 271, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 76, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 322, "replies": [{"body": "Yup, that's what I was planning to do.", "score": 120, "replies": []}, {"body": "Before filing the complaint; let FT know that you intend to file if they don’t compensate you for the loss.
