For Tesla, this could partly be the equivalent of a sale - they have shown in the past that they're willing to raise prices when it makes sense to do so. \n\n- And if we think of it as a sale, then it's really a very small reduction - imagine another car dealer advertising \"big sale - prices 3.5% to 6.2% off on select models!\" - people wouldn't say \"wow - what a huge reduction - they must really be having trouble selling them!\". Tesla's price cuts are a nice incentive to buy (and keep in mind they could raise prices again later, so an incentive to buy now rather than later), but are not large enough to indicate any major difficulty selling cars.\n\n- Some people feel that it \"doesn't make any sense\" to reduce prices if Tesla has plenty of orders. But this assumes that Tesla's main goal is to maximize earnings. Keep in mind that Tesla's real mission is to accelerate the transition to renewable energy and transportation. Over the long term, as Tesla is able to reduce the cost of production, they reduce prices to increase the number of battery electric vehicles being sold and on the road. Elon has stated that if he has a choice between selling fewer cars at higher prices or more cars at lower prices, he would prefer more cars at lower prices. So as Tesla is continually able to reduce production costs, it makes sense to them to lower prices, even if that means not digging every possible penny from the customers' pockets.\n\n- In the context of reducing cost of production, remember that during the shutdown, there were multiple reports of a large amount of activity at the Fremont plant - not vehicle production, but presumably upgrading and/or building production lines. And since Tesla reopened I've seen at least one report of permit applications for further additions to Fremont manufacturing capacity. Even beyond exciting innovations to be introduced on Battery Day, it's very possible that the ongoing upgrades that started during the shutdown have significantly reduced the cost of vehicle production yet again, in which case it would make sense to cut prices.\n\n- Model Y prices are not being cut. That makes sense not just in the context of expected very high order rates, but also because the Model Y production line(s) are the newest, with the least to be gained from upgrades compared to the older production lines. So the improved production efficiencies are largely already \"baked in\" to the current price of the Model Y. At the same time, as Model Y sales are expected to eventually surpass Model S, X, and 3 sales combined, Tesla wants to keep the other production lines busy, so the price cuts make the most sense for those models.\n\n- Other carmakers have been cutting production due to the pandemic and the expectation of being able to sell fewer cars. Many people have pointed out that Tesla stands to gain a huge long-term competitive advantage by gaining market share - selling a larger percentage of the total number of cars being sold. So cutting prices (again in the context of likely lowered cost of production, as mentioned above) could be partly intended as a competitive move to further increase Tesla's market share.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Of course it makes zero sense to pull a demand lever like a price cut, if you’re production constrained.  In that scenario, the only thing a price cut achieves, is increasing the waitlist unnecessarily.\n\nTesla always fine tunes by pulling demand levers, to try and maintain a very healthy order book. They shoot to have about 3 to 6 weeks of orders to fulfill at all times.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "> Of course it makes zero sense to pull a demand lever like a price cut, if you’re production constrained.\n\nRespectfully disagree. As I noted, long term Tesla's cost of production is going down, and long term their goal is to reduce prices to grow sales volume and increase market share. And a company planning to increase production may like to have a waitlist - not only does it provide some assurance that there will be a market for the additional cars, but customers on the waitlist are not customers who are out buying competitor's cars at recent deep discount prices.\n\nAs for why to choose this particular time to cut prices, given that long term they plan to cut prices anyway, of course there's the slowdown in the whole automobile market due to the pandemic and shutdown, but also there are the recent factory upgrades that likely have lowered cost of production, and desire to increase market share, as mentioned earlier (and remember that Teslas driving on the road are one of the company's big advertising tools).\n\nSome other possibilities:\n\n- As the market recovers, it is likely that many people who have been using public transportation will see the benefit of driving a car to reduce the risk of infection - Tesla will be trying to capture part of this market.\n\n- Every time Tesla cuts prices, some people always proclaim \"see, no demand!\", and the stock price takes a hit. Right now when Tesla is presumably basking in the reflected glow of an expected SpaceX Commercial Crew launch might be seen as a time when the impact of the \"no demand\" claims might be reduced. Also, some people who haven't paid much attention to either SpaceX or Tesla may hear about the launch, wonder who this Elon Musk guy is anyway, and out of curiosity look up this Tesla company and wonder what its cars cost. A little more interest in Tesla plus lower prices could bring in more sales orders.\n\nI agree that current economic conditions and the attraction of the Model Y are likely affecting order rates of the older models, but I disagree that if makes \"zero sense\" to cut prices even if there's a waitlist - there could be plenty of sensible reasons for doing so.", "score": -2, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "I thought they were production constrained?
