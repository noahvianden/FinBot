{"title": "Whats your views on recession, are we still expecting one?", "selftext": "...  \n\nEven though the country is planning a reopening, there is a lot of uncertainty regarding how consumers will react. For instance, in China, even after the restrictions were eased in the first week of April, business activities have remained lackluster as many Chinese residents have opted to stay inside in fear of a second wave of Covid-19 infections. Empirical evidence suggests that such waves could often prove to be disastrous. For instance, the second wave of the Spanish Flu pandemic in 1918 killed millions of people in the United States.\n\nIn the United States, things could prove to be similar to that of China.
