It's really hard, if not impossible to predict if that can happen. \n\nWhat we know is that in 2025, 2030 ICE cars will be illegal to sell in Norway, EU and most of the world. It will probably be all electric cars and not meme fuels like hydrogen. Will Tesla have majority market share at that point? \n\nI dunno, by iPhone 4 in 2010 Apple looked pretty dominant with no other phones being able to compare, in 2020 they have a 14% market share and losing to Samsung, Huawei, Xiaomi, BBK Electronics (Oppo, Vivo, Oneplus, Realme). BRK has a over 20% market share and many of their brands wasn't even funded back in 2010. \n\nChina is kinda the wild west of electric cars right now how that will turn out is unknown, most of the companies being propped up by government support. BYD is a bigger EV maker than Tesla with them producing around 100 GWh of batteries now vs Tesla's 35 GWh. \n\nAutonomy I think will be pretty gradual. It's easy to do, but very hard to get right. \n\nBatteries seems like a potential world domination vector, if you can make cheap and good enough batteries you can start selling products to governments instead of cars to random consumers. Take for example Saudi Arabia, they are building 2x nuclear plants in 2020 and another 14 before 2030, at $7 billion each. \n\nIn total those 16 should produce 110 GW electricity. To replace them with batteries you maybe need 10 hour capacity and solar, \n\n16*$7 billion / (110 GW * 10h) in $/kWh = $102/kWh\n\nhttps://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=16*%247+billion+%2F+%28110+GW+*+10h%29+in+%24%2FkWh+\n\nIn Saudi Arabia solar is dirt cheap and they keep breaking records for like $0.013 now. Buying 24h of 110GW solar is only $30 million, meanwhile Tesla gets paid $112 billion for the batteries. \n\nAll you need is to break that $100/kWh limit. Saudi Arabia will be spending those $110 billion on energy regardless. If Tesla can make batteries for $50/kWh and sell them for $90/kWh, they would profit $44 billion, Saudi Arabia would save $13 billion plus won't have to deal with nuclear. \n\nThat's for one deal with one country and it would generate more revenue than Tesla has made to date ($58B vs $112B). \n\nThat deal would be for 1 TWh, and Tesla has plans to do 3TWh/year. So just from their own roadmap, $300B in yearly revenue, $120B profit, and they sell some cars as well. That's better than Apple at $260B revenue and $64B profit. \n\nIf Tesla can only lower costs to $70/kWh, like 30-40% then they would still be making similar profit to Apple", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "It will not be easy to operate / deal in certain areas and countries .

Some of the brands you mentioned are not even sold in US and I think it was calculated decision on Apple’s end to keep their price tag high .

While in China they just make EVs with no quality for even cheaper. \n\nIt's still an open question though, I don't think as many are fine with a 100 mile cheap knock-off chinese car as they are with buying a cheap smartphone.

It is only accelerating.\n\n# Insights from a Mattress Firm Manager\n\nOn another forum I participate on that has a thread focused on this stock, there is a Manager at Mattress Firm (with 15 years of experience in the mattress industry) on the forum that regularly posts.  I don't know if he is corporate or at the store level, but he often posts great insights on Purple.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4ihuzctvqi151.png?width=579&format=png&auto=webp&s=613f5d911b0f145c9d767a0323c8820dac4e3f8b\n\nA few things to note from his post:\n\n1. Memorial Day was recording breaking for mattresses:  Purple was a stand out.\n2. Production at Purple for the cheaper original mattress has been halted to support demand for the higher end Hybrid \"2, 3, and 4s\", which are also much higher revenue and margin for Purple.\n3. Mattress Firm and likely Purple are sold out of inventory if delivery pipelines are at least 4 weeks long.\n4. Most importantly, OP lets us know that Karen won't get her mattress faster by talking to the manager.\n\n# Verifying Sales Volume\n\nTo verify the sales volume assertions from the Mattress Firm guy, I went on to [Purple.com](https://Purple.com) and attempted to go through the ordering process for a King bed.   Purple had a conversion-killing popover like the below (if they are willing to kill conversion with this, you know they aren't hurting for sales and they've probably pulled back on marketing spend to a more efficient level).\n\n**Original Mattress (Cheapest)**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vdbjitvwqi151.png?width=1526&format=png&auto=webp&s=275d521ded5bd4e9d8cea940f9465484ef1c2a23\n\n**Hybrid 2\"**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6q505gsxqi151.png?width=1409&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d5113606e8faa586b6d4ef5992f7a76fd15637a\n\n**Hybrid Premier 3\"**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2n5nypzyqi151.png?width=1618&format=png&auto=webp&s=f2e28eaf7d1882c19a6fece66ce5128f2faad2c5\n\n**Hybrid Premier 4\"**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5mu71exzqi151.png?width=1551&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e00621d981f17baa51bc566fc3755ba213b26e5\n\nI'm sure a few of you are glad I've posted pictures so it makes it easier to follow.   Too bad there are words on the pictures as well...\n\nAs an investor, I'm liking the fact that we sold out of our $75M in revenue value of inventory stock that we had in place at the beginning of the quarter.   I'm also liking that Mattress Firm is four weeks delayed while the DTC site is less delayed:  it shows that management is making good on their promise to prioritize higher margin and revenue DTC sales over wholesale partners for now (in the long run, we obviously want to keep our wholesale partners happy too).\n\nIt is the end of May already.   This stockout pretty much guarantees a revenue maximized Q2 as the next two weeks into June have already been sold.   If sales continue at a reasonable pace, this momentum carries into Q3.   This stock should be worth much more right now.\n\n# Capacity Expansion\n\nWe learned from the earnings call that the 7th Mattress Max machine (the proprietary, built-in-house machines used to make their unique mattresses) will be online by the end of May.   This machine represents an additional 20% increase in capacity over 2019 EOY capacity.\n\nThrough another forum on this stock, we've learned that the manufacturing team now has mandatory Sunday workdays, which were previously voluntary, which is another capacity expansion.\n\nBack of the napkin, this brings us to 910 beds per day of average capacity.   At an estimated average selling price of $2,200 (take the [$1,863 Q1 2020 average selling price from the S-3](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1643953/000119312520140451/d922462ds3a.htm), adjust for the 40% discount the beds are sold to wholesale at, and adjust again for the reduction in wholesale and shift to DTC), this gives PRPL a max manufacturing capacity of $182M or so in revenue for a full 91-day quarter.   Realize that we only get one month of that, but we also had $42M in inventories (at an approximate $75M in DTC revenue value) at the beginning of the quarter.\n\n***Given that we know they are sold out of inventory, we should have a killer Q2 that may be closer to the top end of my previous estimates*** (especially if you include an estimated $15-$20M in revenue from ancillaries like seat cushions for all of your COVID stay at home butts that aren't subject to the same manufacturing constraints).  Hey, it might even beat that top end.   With lower marketing costs per DTC unit.   Awesome.\n\n# PRPL Options Have a Market Maker Now\n\nThe PRPL options chain went live last Thursday, but have been plagued with ridiculously awful bid/ask spreads and little volume, which has resulted in very little open interest.   I've probably had 2500 contracts worth of bids I've cycled through trying to get a reasonable price.\n\nBased upon the reasonable bid/ask spreads yesterday (for a stock of this volume--remember this isn't an S&P 500) today, it looks like we got a market maker to pick up PRPL for us.\n\nI was able to pick up 40 15c contracts at very reasonable prices for Jun and Oct.  There is still a decent sized Bid/Ask, but not out of line at all with a stock of this volume.\n\n# Frequent Comments and Questions\n\nI keep getting the same comments and questions on these threads and via PM, so I figure I would answer some here.\n\n**Why do you only post on PRPL?**\n\nWell, I'm over a million into this stock so it is important to me to keep a good eye on it.   As a result, I know more about this position than any other position I'm holding.  I'm trying to pay it forward to this community by spending the time to write decent DD in appreciation for all the money I have made off of others' DD here.   Please do the same with the stocks you know best.\n\n**This is a pump and dump.**\n\nThis is the antithesis of a pump and dump.  First of all, I've been posting on this for over two years.   Second of all, I've held almost all of my position that entire time (mostly added, but did a few sells in the last few weeks to play with PRPL options).   Third, you are an idiot and don't have any money to play this anyways.\n\n**What is a warrant?**\n\nWarrants are simply options written by the company itself rather than another investor via CBOE.   The warrants trade individually (instead of contracts of 100) under the ticker PRPLW.   They are not available on some brokers (e.g. Robinhood).   They have an expiration of 2/2023 and an exercise price of $11.50 (two warrants for one share).   They are like super LEAPs.\n\n# My Positions\n\nI own:\n\n* 1 share of PRPL\n* 30x 15c 6/19\n* 10x 15c 10/16\n* 521,400x PRPLW\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/alvcvt51ri151.png?width=1242&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6271fed7550fa0aeab2abe6acc7bc066a727f1a\n\nThis isn't investment advice.

I read a few people's comments that you replied to in previous posts, but I just want to be 100% sure.

Making the breakeven $16.50?\n\nIf that's the case the warrants seem like an absolute no brainer with that huge amount of time until expiration.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "You are correct with your math.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "It's already past $15 and no other options exist yet.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah.
