{"title": "Fairly Conservative Stock Advice for the non Expert", "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\nBuy stocks with earnings and increasing revenues. You can forget that occasionally but it takes time to learn when you can do that.\n\nYahoo finance has all the general info you need to assess a stock in most cases but it'll take a while to learn to navigate for everything.\n\n**If you can find a stock that is going up nicely (during normal times) in volume more than triple its average inexplicably on NO CURRENT NEWS-that is the best way i have found explosive stocks-Finding one in a hot sector is a big plus. It may take 2-3 weeks or more before they start popping. The reason this works is because it indicates some 'wise guys' know something is coming that isn't out yet.  It is best used for small cap to low mid cap generally unknown stocks. Don't use this formula for stocks that have crashed and are now bouncing up.**\n\nRead these boards and watch all the business channels as often as you can-Listen when Buffet speaks. This is to learn basic market and business  principles and not necessarily for specific stock picks. If you hear of an interesting stock, do your own due diligence.\n\nA Drip plan on a Utility or Dividend Mutual Fund where you add extra money of the same amount regularly is the surest way to make a nice score over time. Try to get in when the market tanks and/or up your extra contribution at that time.\n\nDon't EVER buy stocks under $3-$4.   If you have to, make sure you can handle a total loss. If you receive a phone call from a broker you don't know to buy one, don't even think about it-just hang up.\n\nAvoid Margin unless you can transfer in covering funds in a day or two\n\nBuy thinly traded stocks that you like when they are down on low volume.\n\nNever set a GTC order for more than a week or two at most.  You can wind up buying a stock for forty  that is 25 ten minutes later. Much less likely to happen in a week or two and then you can re-assess your decision. If you have a GTC  order, you must read the after market and pre market news so that you can cancel your order if something weird is going on. The exception might be in the crypto market  to set some GTC orders at 60% below market and hope for a flash crash.\n\nWith short term trading, only trade stocks with good fundamentals that you wont mind owning if things don't go your way.\n\nDon't buy in the pre market\n\nOnce you sell a stock at a profit, don't buy back in on a small drop\n\nAlways have 20% cash in case of a market crash. Adding money incrementally and waiting for a 5% rally are usually good ideas\n\nIf you get lucky and have a 500% gain or more  inside of a year on a stock, take double your investment  off the table.\n\nRemember  \"No one ever went broke taking a profit\" and You'll never buy at the absolute lows or sell at the highs. When in doubt on taking a profit, sell half!\n\nNONE of this info came from a book. I have never read a book on the market but quite a few articles, watched the business channels, talked extensively to active investors  and been trading and following the market for decades.\n\nGood luck!", "id": "hfktl1", "created_utc": 1593086282.0, "score": 426, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 89, "comments": [{"body": "\"Remember \"No one ever went broke taking a profit\" and You'll never buy at the absolute lows or sell at the highs\"\n\nThat's what I am wrestling with right now concerning Apple and Microsoft.

{"title": "Apple and Amazon: The Big Short", "selftext": "# TLDR: I am bearish on Apple and Amazon in the short term and they will dip below March 2020 lows. This a fairly LONG post and uses Elliott Wave Theory and RSI. If you believe that is bullshit, immediately downvote this post to oblivion. Otherwise, please keep reading!\n\n**Disclosed positions:** SPX December 275 puts (because I'm unfortunately not American and hence can't directly short Amazon/Apple without insane capital requirements :(  )\n\n\\----------\n\nI have attached the charts for two of the largest companies in the S&P500, each having a market capitalization of above $1 trillion. From the looks of the price action - it doesn't look too good. I expect a further decline in these stocks within the next few weeks and months, potentially exceeding even the lows made in March 2020.\n\nLooking at the chart for Apple, the price as of June 25th 2020 seems to have reached the top of Wave (iii) of -v-. Maybe there could be some more room for the price to squeeze up, but a pullback in the form of Wave (iv) is imminent. If the internal structure holds, then we hit the target cluster under **\"Scenario 1\"**, where the price reaches **between 310 - 290** with a 50 - 58.6% Wave (iv) correction. If this support holds, then Wave (v) up is the next logical move.\n\nHowever, I am of the strong belief now that the price will go down further, and this is based on alternation theory. The major Wave (II) was in fact only a shallow 33% decline (not shown in the image), which seems to indicate that Wave (IV) will be rather deep. This leads us to **\"Scenario 2\"**, where the price could reach **between the** **230 - 200 level** with more than a 50% correction. There is a possibility we could go lower, and this is because the internal Wave -iv- was a 76.4% correction - rather unusually deep. Generally, a correction such as this should not violate the Wave (b) of -iii-, but in rare cases such as this, the overall structure still seems to remain intact.\n\nTo further solidify the hypothesis that Wave (IV) could go lower than the March 2020 lows, the wave structure seems to be forming an expanded flat pattern which I have highlighted, and also the RSI appears to be forming a rather **weak bearish divergence**.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Price projections for AAPL \\(25th June 2020\\)](https://preview.redd.it/jhx5a108x1751.png?width=1545&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c724f4a08670934ad38127776d79a69c2f3e9ae)\n\nNext up is of course, Amazon. Like Apple, the price action has practically been parabolic since 2008, and many a bear trap have caught bears off guard.\n\nBut this time, I think the bears may have it. It is quite rare for a Wave -v- forming inside of a major Wave (v) and (III), all aligning at the right projections. Wave (III) was a super extended rally, and I expect it to continue in the long term with a Wave (V). But as Wave (II) was a rather shallow 23.6% correction, it is expected that Wave (IV) be deep, supported by the developments of the internal Wave -v- and (v). The projection cluster here is **between 1630 - 1440** for the Wave (IV).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Price projections for AMZN \\(25th June 2020\\)](https://preview.redd.it/bqotcoppx1751.png?width=1545&format=png&auto=webp&s=3725424b60d3c7d69aa8c456489cfb6cc6f951f6)\n\nPerhaps my counts could be wrong and the price just keeps going up due to strong fiscal and monetary responses. But that would mean even the internal waves are wrong which currently strongly confirms the hypothesis that we have in fact, reached the top as of June 25th 2020 (plus or minus 7 days). If the price indeed goes up, then we can say for certain that Elliott Wave Theory does not possess much long-term predictive ability in identifying reversal points in the future, as this current forecast large rests on the assumption that the current top is a major Wave (III) supported by an internal Wave -v-.  \n\n**Edit 1: It is clear most folks here have unfortunately not read my post, as they seem to be thinking I'm comparing 2020 with 2008. For those who understand Elliott Wave theory, know I'm not bearish long term. There is still a bullish Wave (V) due after this short term Wave (IV) dip. The only difference is that I'm saying Wave (IV) still has more room to dip, thats all.**", "id": "hflgc6", "created_utc": 1593089109.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.47, "num_comments": 87, "comments": [{"body": "Inverse this guy.
