{"title": "IMPORTANT please read DD before going all in (serious post)", "selftext": "OK I see a lot of retards here that don't really understand whats happening. The FED making this announcement signals (just like when they lowered interest rates the first week of the first crash) that they think a crash may happen this time too. However, with bonds so expensive they know that if a crash materialises much of the liquidity will be drained not only from equities but also from bonds, making dollar squeeze high to the moon like a MF.\n\n As bear JPOW said last week (remember retards?) they don't want liquidity to drain from bonds as this may cause trouble even for solvent companies to refinance their debt. This message by the FED is pretty much a \"if things go wrong please go into bonds, we got your back\". Also it means that they expect deflation which is a BAD signal, they want to keep rates low without having to control yields.\n\nEDIT: positions\nLong portfolio of stonks hedged with\nSPY 230p 9/19 and 200p 12/19", "id": "h9mqlh", "created_utc": 1592248348.0, "score": 74, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 83, "comments": [{"body": "Bear, bull, kang, the market will always be there.
