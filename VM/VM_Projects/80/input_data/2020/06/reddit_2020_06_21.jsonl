{"title": "DD: $GE Boomer Stock Moon ShotðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€", "selftext": "Alright boys, here is your next big tendie ðŸš€play for yoloing autists like myself or bagholding boomers that want to hold LEAPs for your wifeâ€™s child college fund. \n\nHereâ€™s some key points unraveling here and there will be a TL:DR at the bottom for you low attention span retards.\n\n1.\t**If JPOW is god than Larry Culp is Jesus**: For the first time ever GE hired a CEO who was an outsider of the company. Culp was previously the CEO of Danaher for 13 years and increased their stock price by over 1000%. He was brought in after Flannery failed to produce and his pay package is one of the most aggressive performance oriented package ever seen, with a possible $317 million payout in 2022. It is in his best interest to correct GE in the right direction and If this man cannot fix this company then inverse this DD and short the fuck out of it\n\n2.\t**Boeing/GE 737 recertification catalyst**: It has been over a year and 3 months since the 737 max was grounded and has been plaguing Boeing since before Covid19. GE makes the engines for the 737 Max and has suffered along with Boeing with orders being cancelled. Everything surrounding the recertification flight has been kept tight lipped with the FAA and Boeing releasing little details. What we do know is they are looking at it possibly certifying later this month or early July and we know Boeing would not continue with this unless they were positive they would pass. Experts says a successful flight would mean that Boeing stock would shoot up no less than 15% after news is released with GE right behind\n\n3.\t**GE surge Quarterly Earning Report and current progress**: To fix company debt issues Culp has sold off underperforming divisions with sales of GE lightbulb 250 million to Savant and GE Biopharma for 21 billion to Danaher. GE has normally surged after quarterlies and have exceeded EPS except for the most reason one due to Corona. With the FEDs recent announcement to buy corporate bonds GE stands as a possible player to benefit from JPOWs printer. GE also is still not anywhere near covid ATHs and could see 40-60% increase in the next few months.\n\nFor all the strict options gamblers premiums on contracts are one of the few things that have not been inflated in this Kangaroo Market. These are also not low volume plays with good open interest.\n\nTL:DR: GE going to the moon ðŸš€ðŸŒ™. Buy in now for potential 10 bagger\n-\t7/10 $8.5c - 737 Max yolo\n-\t8/21 $11 or $12c - Earnings and 737 Max yolo\n-\t1/21/22 $20c - LEAPs for boomer and belief in Savior\n\nMy position: 47k yolo on 8/21 $11 and $12 calls\n\n[ðŸ’ŽðŸ™Œ baby](https://i.imgur.com/Xkf75mH.jpg)", "id": "hd4529", "created_utc": 1592732120.0, "score": 153, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 87, "comments": [{"body": "I have pretty in depth knowledge of GE as generations of my family have worked there.

But ultimately I think he loses this bet. GE's saving grace was their aviation department which was going to carry them through restructuring. That department is flatlining right now, leading GE to burn billions in cash every quarter.

That 1 cent dividend isn't keeping institutional investors invested.  The only way that changes is if ditching the money losing branches actually allows the dividend to increase to something above a 1% dividend yield.
