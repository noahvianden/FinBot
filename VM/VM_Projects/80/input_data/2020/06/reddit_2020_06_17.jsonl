{"title": "My Analysis of Snapchat (NYSE: SNAP) - a long term bet on innovation", "selftext": "# Hey everyone, here is my take on SNAP (NYSE). Pls let me know your thoughts (supporting/ conflicting) etc. or if there's anything else I need to cover. This is just my opinion of the stock and I could definitely go into way more detail...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## 🔥 Investment Thesis\n\n1. Snapchat has the potential to become the first Western Super App\n2. Snapchat is a bet on innovation, and that innovation wins in the end\n3. Snapchat is leading the way with augmented reality and is a long-term hardware play\n\n#### (1) Snapchat has the potential to become the first Western SuperApp\n\n* On June 11th, Snap announced **Minis**. These are micro applications that third-party devs build for people to use inside of Snapchat.  \n\n   * Snap is starting with 7 Minis with some big partners including Headspace (meditate with friends) and Coachella (coordinate your festival line-up with friends).\n* We can look at the success and misfortunes of other companies who have launched micro applications to see if this is a good move for Snap:  \n\n   * **Bull Case: Snapchat replicates** [**WeChat’s success with Mini Programs**](https://melchers-china.com/wechat-mini-programs-a-rapidly-growing-trading-channel-in-china/)  \n\n      * Mini Programs launched on WeChat in 2017\n      * By August 2019, there were 2.36 million WeChat mini-programs\n      * In 2019, over 300 million people had spent a collective [$115B](http://routenote.com/blog/tencent-made-115-billion-just-from-wechats-mini-apps-in-2019/#:~:text=Tencent%20revealed%20the%20news%20that,expand%20the%20platform%20in%202020.) through WeChat Mini Programs\n      * Chinese research agency Kueclub and Tencent Research & Development found 40% of 8000 research respondents believe they will completely replace standalone apps one day\n      * Since announcing WeChat Mini Programs in [December 2016](https://chinachannel.co/try-wechat-mini-programs-now/), Tencent (owner of WeChat) stock has increased over 130%\n   * **Bear Case: Snapchat follows the sad path of iMessage apps…**  \n\n      * These are small apps that you can access through iMessage on iPhone\n      * Developers seemed to [lose interest](https://www.macrumors.com/2017/03/16/developer-imessage-apps-fading/) in 2017 after 6 months.\n      * Hasn’t grown much beyond Sticker packs… and certainly nowhere near as big as WeChat Mini Programs\n* My Take:  \n\n   * **Evidence of Success:** Snap has killed it since opening its platform up to developers. Out of [800 apps integrated with Snapkit](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200611005151/en/Snap-Announces-New-Developer-Products-Partnerships-Snap), 20 are in the top 100 of the app store at the moment. Snap Games have also seen a successful start with over [100 million users](https://venturebeat.com/2020/06/11/snap-hits-100-million-players-teams-with-zynga-and-launches-more-chat-games/) since they launched last year. I expect similar success for Snap Minis, and ultimately for them to follow the path of WeChat.\n   * **Snap becomes stickier:** If Minis are successful, it’ll make Snapchat very sticky. Why would people leave the Snap app when so many other convenient services are offered on it? Snap previously made their app sticky with Snap streaks, and now they’re going to make it even more so with Snap minis.\n   * **Growth opportunities:** If everyone is using Snap Minis to plan, shop, and socially book tickets together, non-users will be persuaded to download Snapchat to access these programs specifically.\n   * **Revenue diversification:** Snapchat has a huge opportunity to diversify revenue beyond adverts and brand partnerships, by taking a cut of revenue spent through e-commerce Snap Minis (see above: $115BUSD spent through WeChat mini-programs in 2019).\n\n### (2) Snapchat is the most innovative social media company\n\n* This is pretty clear from all the news articles released about Facebook copying everything Snapchat does\n* Snapchat was [**FastCompany’s most innovative company of 2020…**](https://www.fastcompany.com/most-innovative-companies/2020) a list that also placed Tesla, Shopify, Beyond Meat, and Spotify in the top 15.\n* It’s worth reading more about this [**here**](https://www.fastcompany.com/90457684/snap-most-innovative-companies-2020)\n\n### (3) Snapchat is leading the charge with Augmented Reality and is a long-term hardware play\n\n* **Leading the charge into Augmented Reality:**  \n\n   * According to Mordor Intelligence, the Augmented Reality market is expected to have a CAGR of [152%](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/augmented-reality-market) between 2019 and 2020, and the user base for AR technologies is also expected to grow beyond 1 billion by 2025.\n   * Researchandmarkets.com is more bearish, estimating the [size of the AR market](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200515005267/en/Global-Augmented-Reality-Mixed-Reality-Market-Growth) to only grow at 44.74% (still ridiculously high) to USD 27.44 billion by 2025, up from USD 2.98 billion in 2019.\n   * Snap is positioning itself to take a large proportion of the consumer-facing AR market.  \n\n      * More than [170 million](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-11/snap-says-170-million-use-its-augmented-reality-tools-daily) people use Snapchats Augmented Reality tools daily\n      * Snap recently announced an AR tool called Scan that allows people to digitally interact with anything they see with their iPhone camera  \n\n   * Snap was rated as the #1 most innovative VR/ AR company of 2020 by Fast Company, and if they can use this to capture a large proportion of the consumer AR market (27.44B in 2025 - see above), their revenue and valuation could be off the charts in the medium - long term.\n* **Long-term hardware play**  \n\n   * Following the iPhone and subsequent Android smartphone releases in the past decade, AR glasses have long-believed to be the next major hardware step in computing that will change the way we interact with the world\n   * Evan Spiegel (Snapchat CEO) believes we are unlikely to see mainstream AR glasses for another 10 years\n   * In an interview, Evan Spiegel stated  \n*“Spectacles, because they’re a new type of camera, they’re still event-based in terms of usage. You go on a really cool trip, you’re playing with your kids, whatever it is — and you want to represent that moment in a totally new way, from your perspective in 3D. So for now, I do think it’s going to continue to be an event-based product.* ***But what’s really exciting is that over time, we’ve seen the capacity for these cameras to evolve from event-based products to products that are used all day long. So, I think we’re just on that journey with Spectacles****. And we’re fortunate that we can continue to invest along that path to get there.”*  \n\n      * While open to interpretation, this could mean that Snapchat is investing in Snap Spectacles, with the aim they will eventually become AR glasses armed with Snapchats AR software to compete with [Apple’s much-anticipated equivalent](https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-glasses/).\n   * **EVEN MORE INTERESTING:** On top of Snap’s augmented reality software capabilities, Snap has also announced [voice-enabled](https://mashable.com/article/snapchat-voice-scan-lens-finder/) lenses called Voice Scan. This is similar to Apple’s Siri or Amazon’s Alexa.  \n\n      * Voice could potentially be used as a control-mechanism for AR glasses later down the track\n   * **My Take:** AR glasses seem to me like an inevitability, however, whether or not Snapchat create them is a pretty huge speculation. However, the upside of this speculation could be **ridiculous**. Using the case of Apple and the iPhone as an example:  \n\n      * There are currently [728 million iPhones ](https://www.statista.com/statistics/755625/iphones-in-use-in-us-china-and-rest-of-the-world/)in use around the world\n      * When Apple announced the iPhone on the 9th of January 2017, its stock price was [$11.94](https://www.businessinsider.com.au/apple-stock-price-in-the-10-years-of-the-iphone-2017-6?r=US&IR=T)USD. Since then it has appreciated over 2500% to $352.08USD. Apple’s market cap was less than $80B when it announced the iPhone, today it is $1T.\n      * If AR achieves a similar reach, then the dominant AR hardware company could see similar success to this.\n\n## 👎Risks\n\nNo investment is without risks.\n\n* Many people believe Superapps will [fail in the Western world](https://blog.prototypr.io/why-chinas-super-apps-will-never-succeed-in-the-us-64c686c8c5d6), so Snapchat Minis won’t succeed in a big way.  \n\n   * Western world and Asia do have incredibly different internet ecosystems with China effectively jumping straight to mobile\n   * Snap has had recent success with its Snap Kit and Snap Games, however, only time will tell\n* Snapchat is dying and will be replaced by the next social network  \n\n   * Snap still reaches more 13-34-year-olds in the US than Facebook or Instagram. It also reaches more users in the US than TikTok and Twitter combined.\n   * Snapchat growth has significantly underperformed [Instagram](https://www.statista.com/chart/15034/worldwide-user-growth-of-instagram-and-snapchat/). However, it would be worth to look into where the growth comes from (age and country demographics).\n   * It is entirely possible that the next social network could be built on top of Snapchat ([Hoop](https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/05/hoop-snapchat-app/), [Wink](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/wink-make-new-snap-friends/id1482681335), [YOLO](https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/08/download-yolo-app/) are some of the fastest-growing consumer apps and are all heavily reliant on Snapchat)\n   * Snap isn’t afraid to acquire the next social network, having previously acquired [Bitmoji](https://www.bitmoji.com/) and [Zenly](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.zenly.locator&hl=en_AU)\n* Snapchat has Facebook copying everything they do  \n\n   * [Evan Spiegel doesn’t seem too worried about this](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/evan-spiegel-says-facebook-copying-their-popular-features-is-the-most-fantastic-feeling-ever/articleshow/64379256.cms) so long as Snapchat remain innovative and ahead of the park  \n\n      * *“If you can create something that is so beautiful and simple that the only thing other people can do is copy it exactly, that is the most fantastic feeling. It is the most fantastic thing in the entire world.”*\n* Snapchat won’t become profitable  \n\n   * One of the biggest tests for Snap will be figuring out a monetization model beyond advertising. No one has cracked this outside of China yet, and Snap’s messaging network of close friends makes it possibly the best positioned to do so.\n* Snap spectacles suck..  \n\n   * They do suck, but as mentioned above they could simply be a step in the process of getting to full AR glasses.\n* Snap is already huge ($23B company), it won’t grow much more  \n\n   * Snap has the long-term potential to be the size of any of the top consumer tech companies. Apple $1.47T (51x Snap), Google $964B (33x), Facebook $653B (23x) and Netflix $184B (6x).\n* Before investing, make sure you read Snapchat’s prospectus and yearly reports to see more risks.\n\n## Current valuation\n\n* Amongst the 35 analysts that cover Snap, the average target price is $18.66\n* At the current price, the consensus is Snapchat is marginally overvalued. However, with plenty of positive information being released at the Snap Partner Summit, this could change when analysts next update their ratings.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n* Worth digging deeper if you’re a patient investor, looking to buy and hold for the long-term (minimum 5-10 years)\n* Could crash again like in 2018 if Snap fails to execute mini-apps etc. or if young generation has a fundamental shift to another social network\n* *Disclosure: I’m long SNAP through underlying equity, but not that long… it represents a very small proportion of my overall portfolio.

I'm not retarded enough to buy SNAP options though.", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": " Disclaimer, I am short Snap and have lost a lot of money:\n\nHere is my take on Snap.\n\nTheir main product, messaging, isn't profitable and can never be because you can't monetize messaging to any reasonable extent. This is because the second you inconvenience users in any way, they will just switch to another free alternative. As such, no standalone messaging app has ever succeeded, e.g. ICQ. They've all been part of larger companies that financially support them. However, even then messaging apps supported by larger companies such as with MSN messenger/Microsoft, AIM/AOL, Yahoo messenger/Yahoo, Google Hangouts/Google, that were immensely popular in their day, were eventually shut down when the larger companies simply lose interest due to lack of profit. And the current generation of popular messaging services are also all financially supported by larger parent companies:  Facebook Messenger/Facebook, Whatsapp/Facebook, WeChat/Tencent, Skype/Microsoft, iMessages/Apple, and Android Messages/Google. Snap doesn't have this support. In addition, the company has been around for 9 years, still hasn't turned a profit, and has lost somewhere around $7 billion. So if somehow Snap is able to succeed, it will be a major outlier. \n\nHowever, it is a very popular messaging app, a lot of people use it and there may be an opportunity to monetize these users in some way outside of messaging since they open the app every day. This is why Snap is putting so much resources into other projects outside of messaging, this is where they are trying to make money. They received a lot of IPO and bond issuance money and they are throwing this money in all different directions hoping something will stick and allow them to make a profit from their large number of users. For example, they have tried the following:\n\nhardware company (Snap Spectacles)\n\nmoney transfer service (Snapcash)\n\nsocial media platform (Snap stories)\n\ncamera company (lenses)\n\nThese have all failed to turn a profit. Now they are trying the following:\n\naugmented reality storefronts (Lego, Nike, Amazon, etc.)\n\nmedia platform and content producer (similar to Youtube, Netflix, Facebook, etc.)\n\ngaming platform (similar to Facebook)\n\noperating system (Snap mini's)\n\nHowever, with these new ventures, there is a big difference compared to established players. These companies host their own content (e.g. Youtube) they don't have to pay hosting costs. In contrast, Snapchat has to pay about $750 million dollars (and growing) every year to Google and Amazon to host these services. Also, Snapchat doesn't have a profitable core product, like Facebook Inc. does with the Facebook website/app and Google does with Google Search and Google Cloud, to prop these experiments up and financially support them indefinitely, all they have is a dwindling cash pile.\n\nIf these new ventures don't work out, Snap will have to try something else. However, Snapchat now has $2 billion dollars in debt. They've spent the rest with little to show for it financially. If they are not demonstrably profitable when they have to rollover this debt, they will be hit with large interest rates, which will absolutely guarantee they never turn a profit and will also crash the share price.\n\nAnd to make this all more difficult, Snapchat users are teenagers and people in their early 20's. Once people reach their mid-late 20's and settle down, they stop using Snapchat. This is a problem because these users command the lowest ad prices. For example, I receive relevant ads on Instagram/Facebook for European river cruises, auction houses selling expensive pieces of historical art, etc. These ads are relevant, highly targeted, flawlessly integrated into my media stream, and I actually engage with them. They command high prices. Contrast this to the ads I receive on Snapchat, which are click-bait and low margin. People say that Facebook is less popular with teens ever since adults started to use it. While this is true, it's also true that it was only once adults started using Facebook that their revenues exploded, as such users command high ad pricing. So Snapchat has the problem that their user base doesn't result in high ad prices.\n\nLastly, Snap has a lot of competition in all of its segments with very deep pockets.\n\nWith regard to messaging, Snap has a lot of free competition: SMS, iMessage, Whatsapp, Facebook Messenger, Instagram/Threads, and other messaging services that are more popular in other countries such as LINE, Viber, Kik, Telegram, GroupMe, Signal and WeChat. In addition, RCS messages will replace SMS and be the new standard soon, with many advanced messaging features seen with Snapchat such as read receipts and filters built in. Whatsapp will also soon ad ephemeral messaging and presumably iMessage will at some point as well. This is not to say people will stop using Snapchat, it just means Snap can never make their messaging service inconvenient in any way (e.g. place ads), because people will just flock to alternatives. As such, profit can never made from messaging, Snapchat's core function.\n\nWith regard to following celebrities and companies, Snap has to compete with: Instagram (photos and stories), Twitter (text and photos), and Facebook (stories, photos, and text). This is already a crowded space.\n\nWith regard to original content and video, Snap has to compete with: Youtube, Netflix, HBO/Time Warner, Hulu, Disney, Amazon, CBS, NBC, Apple, Facebook, Instagram, and Quibi. The streaming wars are in full swing right now and horrendously expensive. Snapchat doesn't have the back catalog or budget to produce high quality content. These companies also have deep pockets and/or subscription fees, and can afford to go into a war of attrition, whereas Snap cannot. It's also worth noting that Youtube has never made a profit. I find it hard to believe that Snapchat can turn a profit as it tries to become a media hosting company, when it has to actually pay for this hosting unlike Youtube.\n\nWith regard to photo editing, filters, and lenses, Snap will have to compete with Adobe Photoshop Camera.\n\nWith regard to video games, Snap has to compete with all the large mobile gaming companies: Epic Games (Fortnite), Activision/Blizzard, Nintendo, EA (FIFA, Madden, etc.), Niantic (Pokemon Go/Harry Potter), Tencent, Bandai (DBZ), Microsoft (Minecraft), Rockstar games (GTA), etc. These companies make money from selling games and microtransactions. I cannot think of a single reason why they would rather use the Snapchat platform as opposed to the native Android and iOs platforms that already have everything they need, are more mature and well developed, and give them more control over their games and their monetization. And in the cases when they don't want their own platform, they can just use Apple arcade.\n\nWith regard to short silly videos, Snap has to compete with TikTok, a Chinese company propped up by the multi-billion dollar Chinese company ByteDance, which means there is an effectively endless amount of financial support from the Chinese government.\n\nGiven all this, can Snap pull it off? Maybe, but so far the answer has been \"no\" and the odds are stacked against them. This is a very high risk stock. If the stock was trading at $4-$5, perhaps it would be worth the gamble. But with a current market cap. of $30 billion, the risk/reward ratio just isn't there.", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "It boggles my mind how a company that has done nothing but lose money can be worth $30B.

Just look at the damn history of revenue growth. The numbers speak for themselves. Just accept that Elon Musk thinks at a different frequency than the rest of us and look at his track record. Look at the numbers.[https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TSLA/tesla/revenue](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TSLA/tesla/revenue)Read their quarterly report and pay attention to operating costs. Their income statement is piss easy to understand. Once you have seen how stable their fixed costs have been, you will see a clear path to and just how easy it is to drastically increase earnings through growth, which conveniently they have in droves.Of course the current price reflects expectation of future growth, the question is whether that future growth is realistic or not. If anything, it's unrealistically low. If you use a 50 multiple like I told you to, Tesla just needs $1B of growth profit per quarter to justify a $200B valuation. That's about 200k cars which they can do in 2022. Then what about 2023, 2025? They'll still be growing at 40% way beyond that because Tesla is more than about cars. Have you read about the several Powerpack contracts across the globe. Energy easily doubles Tesla's valuation as Elon Musk said Energy is bigger than car making.  \nIts balance sheet is one of the most solid right now. You haven't done any homework. Tesla was one of the few companies who didn't take out any COVID loans. Why is that? If their balance sheet is so bad, why don't they take out any? Nasdaq recommended Tesla as a low leverage company to invest in right now.  \n [https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/buy-these-5-low-leverage-stocks-to-avoid-debt-related-risk-2020-06-17](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/buy-these-5-low-leverage-stocks-to-avoid-debt-related-risk-2020-06-17)", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}
