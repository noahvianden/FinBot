This could be the final proof that \"get woke, go broke\" is a real thing, or if Tesla emerges victorious, expect a skyrocket to $1150-$1200.  \n\nThis will also be an opportunity to out CNBC or Bloomberg TV what side they are on; the side of the market, or have they fallen to the same forces as the rest of the retard media?  The only colors I want to hear about on CNBC or Bloomberg is GREEN or RED.  They might actually be costing someone money at this point, talking about race, when they could be reporting on actual market news.  If they want to talk about race and market news, they should talk about RLJ, BYCF, and that one CORV or CORN or whatever the hell it is.  At least then it'd be relevant to the reason for their channel:  TEH FUCKING STONK MARKET!@!@  \n\nI know CNBC and others read stuff in here.   Please stop trying to be CNN and whoever else.  I don't need hard hitting journalism on the state of the race relations in America from your channel.  I watch all of that later on at night during the news.  Please tell me WTF is happening in the STOCK MARKET 30 minutes after the market has opened for fooks sake!  \n\nAnyway, I digress.   CNBC will reveal their true colors on monday.  Are they on team Green?  Or literally any other team than team GREEN.  Because if they aren't on team GREEN, then I'm never watching it again.  \n\nTLDR;\nTesla vs the Woke Machine Monday  \nThis will set up CNBC to reveal themselves as actual financial news, or merely social justice warriors  \n\n\nCNBC: Please stop being social justice warriors, you might be costing me actual fucking money!  The STOCK MARKET only please.  I know it's kind of a running joke, but this past week it was true:  I had better information in this subreddit, than on your fucking channel.  Think about that.  How you treat TSLA on Monday will show your true colors.", "score": -2, "replies": [{"body": "ok boomer", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}
