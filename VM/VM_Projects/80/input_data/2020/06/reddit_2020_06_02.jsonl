Well, if we have never actually paid off any of that deficit then how did it add money? Could one argue it destroyed money( taking it out of supply chain)? I mean, yea they can lend it to other reserve banks and commercial banks, but commercial banks cannot lend it to businesses or consumers, and they have to give the FED treasuries (collateral). It is stated right there in the federal Reserve Act of 1937. By that Act in of itself they are not contributing to the money supply, once again it says it right fucking there. Commercial Banks CAN create money supply. When there is demand built up, in a INFLATIONARY ECONOMY, they will. If commercial banks had pent up demand and the FED just added to their money supply then why the fuck would they need to constrict lending standards/requirements?Consumers and businesses cant get a loan from a federal reserve bank though, only through a commercial bank. So why has the federal interest rate been in a rate of decline since the 80's? We weren't printing the whole time. As we ease off of printing we should be seeing interest rates increase, but we arent and we haven't. QE works in an inflationary environment. The act itself Disinflationary/deflationary.

This helps ensure that banks are solvent and have enough funds to meet demand for withdrawals, and can be used to limit the process of money creation in the banking system.[3] However, rather than directly controlling the money supply, central banks usually pursue an interest rate target to control bank issuance of credit and the rate of inflation.[4]\"", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "To actually add money to the money supply \"printing money\" would take an act of congress to repeal the Federal Reserve Act of 1937.
