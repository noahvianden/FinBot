{"title": "All aboard the unsinkable USS Stonk Market", "selftext": "Imagine you've spent half your life savings to buy a ticket on the legendary USS Stonk Market.\n\n\"Unsinkable,\" they say. \"Literally can't go tits up.\"\n\nYou board, and oh my God, everything they said about it is true. Not long after you board, you meet this sexy, rich bombshell named JPow. There's immediate raw sexual tension. She invites you to the first class area, and although everyone there treats you like a dirty commoner, you make those assholes like Warren Buffett and Carl Icahn look like tendy-less autists with your IQ of 150 and dank memes.\n\nMeanwhile, the sexual energy between you and JPow reaches an eruption point. You paint her like a French girl before you begin fucking her silly. That \"Brrrrrr\" sound as she blows on your asshole and jerks off your dick is the sweetest thing you've ever heard.\n\nAs you switch and start eating out JPow's asshole, there's a sickening thud and the whole boat shakes. \"That's weird,\" you think, but the captain makes an announcement and says everything is fine.\n\nMoments later, one of those rich douchebags from first class comes to you and says, \"Listen chap, I own a 1/100 share of this ship. I'll sell it to you for 10% of the original price.\" Now you, with your IQ of 150, can immediately do the math in your head. Shit, this beta cuck is gonna sell you an easy 10x opportunity for pennies on the dollar? You can't help but shake your head and laugh as you give the other half of your life savings to this pussy paper hands bitch, who leaves on a shitty raft like the dickless fuck he is while you jerk yourself off to your money-making genius.\n\nSoon, all the first class passengers are selling their shares in the ship to the third class, and the price of these shares soar from the buying frenzy. This drives the price of these shares to nearly their original price. You can't believe it. How is making money this easy? Clearly if those fuckheads on first class are that stupid and have only billions of dollars, you with your autistic savant IQ would be able to make trillions!\n\nYesterday, there was another sickening lurch, and some of the other pussy cucks started to panic, but not you. Because you are a goddamn genius. In fact, you've taken out a loan and bought up more shares from those paper hand bitches. \"Who cares about a bump,\" you think, as you drift off to sleep thinking about tendies and JPow's tight hairy asshole. \"Once we land, I'm going to be fucking rich.\"\n\nEDIT: In all seriousness, please be careful out there folks. If you see all the rich people leaving the ship, at least entertain the possibility that you're wrong, not them.
