{"title": "Travel Stocks: A Warning to Long-Term Investors", "selftext": " It seems the popularity of airline and travel stocks has rebounded of late. If you’re a short-term speculative trader you may be able to profit off short-term volatility. For a long-term investor these companies are sure to underperform the overall market with several facing serious risk of bankruptcy.\n\nFor those that don’t remember, or maybe not old enough to focus on the economy, the last time we faced a demand shortage we saw serious contraction in the airline industry with several prominent chapter 11 filings. Last time around the government attempted to bailout the airlines resulting in little success. Out of the top four airlines in the last crisis, only American Airlines stockholders maintained their holdings. However, even American shareholders had to endure a chapter 11 filing, the only saving grace was they saw their holdings in $AMR get rolled over into the newly created $AAL. The other top airlines were United, Delta, and Northwest, all of which declared chapter 11 bankruptcy. Shareholders lost everything in their bankruptcy proceedings. \n\nWhat we see in the airline industry directly correlates to other travel related companies. With air travel down as much as 90% year-over-year hotel occupancy rates have dropped significantly. Add in the fact that we’re facing unprecedented unemployment levels heading into peak travel season and you have a recipe for disaster. The cruise lines still face regulatory hurdles and it’s unclear when they’ll be back on the open seas at peak capacity.\n\nThe travel industry as a whole will eventually bounce back, but that doesn’t mean investors should be flocking to these *sale* prices.
