{"title": "Disconnect Emotion from trading - A lesson", "selftext": "This morning I learnt a very valuable lesson.. Two actually. The first was to not be a dumbass and only make trades that make sense for your account size regardless of the potential reward and secondly, in my opinion even more importantly, never let emotions influence your trades. \n\nYesterday after the crazy rally that AAPL had, i knew there would be a pullback to stabilize the price a bit. My strategy was to enter the play at what I thought would be the peak of AAPL rally, around 370. At 371, with my opinion, great timing, i purchased the 365 put with a 6/26 expiration. Terrible expiration imo but it was the only contract close enough to the money at a reasonable price for my account. (The trade was around 70% of my buying power, my first lesson). I planned to sell bby end of day when the pullback occurs. I was busy at the time I wanted to sell and for family reasons had to hold through the night. Come this morning, AAPL opens lower and aim thinking, great it will continue a decline and correct its price. Welp around 10 min into market open I see it begin to rally again to 368 and get freaked out, knowing that this is practically my whole account and even a couple points higher could basically wipe me out. So i sold the contract due to the emotions. \n\nIn the moment, it seemed like a good idea since I did not want to take on the risk of blowing up my account. Now AAPl is at 362 and my contract is worth double the price. \n\nHopefully you guys can also learn from my mistake and not let emotions influence your trades.", "id": "hf317j", "created_utc": 1593012598.0, "score": 206, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 84, "comments": [{"body": "I think this is great lesson and thanks for sharing it so honestly.
