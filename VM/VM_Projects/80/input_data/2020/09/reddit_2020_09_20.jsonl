{"title": "This is a next level idiot...", "selftext": "Some of you might remember our lady friend who asked this subreddit 2 times for somebody to \"invest\" for her. Here is her post begging for people to gamble for her. We tried to tell her to not be an idiot but apparently she didn't listen\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/im4l57/so\\_my\\_post\\_asking\\_for\\_someone\\_to\\_invest\\_for\\_me/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/im4l57/so_my_post_asking_for_someone_to_invest_for_me/)\n\nShe stated, \" Why can’t it be done? Why does it need the pomp and circumstance of Wall Street? Say I know a friend who’s doing well I can’t give them my money to trade for me?\" \n\nI put a reminder on all these kind of posts and today I was reminded. I found out that she gave somebody $1000 to \"invest\" and the person ran away with the money saying that he/she lost it all but provided no proof....(facepalm) \n\nThis is her new post: \n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/smallstreetbets/comments/ivz8fu/i\\_gave\\_someone\\_on\\_reddit\\_1000\\_dollars\\_to\\_trade/](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallstreetbets/comments/ivz8fu/i_gave_someone_on_reddit_1000_dollars_to_trade/) \n\nPeople, we are all retards but don't be this kind of retard.\n\nEdit: look like one of the commenter who agreed to help her in the original post was the one that run away with her money. She knew the person but refuses to reveal the name to the public. This post is not trying to shame the lady but to let the new retards know the risk of trusting strangers on internet with your money. \n\nPositions:\nTSLA $500c 9/25 \nTSLA $450c 9/25", "id": "iw5a2w", "created_utc": 1600567208.0, "score": 218, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 78, "comments": [{"body": "Lmao if you’re willing to give a stranger on wsb $1000 then you deserved to be parted with your $1000.
