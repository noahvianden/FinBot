Walmart is an absolute giant and the fact that they're going to use their infrastructure to compete with amazon prime is huge.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere are a couple stats to give you autists the scale of what's going on here:\n\n**Employees**\n\n|Amazon|840,400|\n|:-|:-|\n|Walmart|1,500,000 (US only)|\n\n**2019 Revenue**\n\n|Amazon|$280.52B|\n|:-|:-|\n|Walmart|$514.4B|\n\n**2020 Q2 Revenue\\***\n\n|Amazon|$88.91B|\n|:-|:-|\n|Walmart|$137.7B|\n\n\\*Basically walmart is doing fine despite the virus\n\nSo now walmart is now going to use all this infrastructure to go head to head with amazon prime.

Not even amazon can ship that broad an inventory on a day's notice without extra fees.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd also I'm gonna bet that since they're delivering groceries (again, directly competing with amazon) which is gonna be an \"essential business\" they'll get all kinds of bullshit tax breaks / ppp loans / who the fuck knows.

{"title": "The pros are getting ready for a market crash ‚Äî retail investors, not so much, top economist warns", "selftext": "‚ÄòA large market correction, should one materialise, would encourage more professional selling that could overwhelm the buy-the-dip retail investor.‚Äô\n\nThat‚Äôs Mohamed El-Erian, Allianz‚Äôs chief economic adviser, explaining in an op-ed for the Financial Times how action in the options pits should be taken as a warning by retail investors who have been cashing in on the stock market‚Äôs relentless push higher in recent months.\n\n‚ÄúThe seemingly endless rally‚Ä¶ gives the impression that prices are endorsed and supported by the entire professional investment community,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAfter all, despite the vocal concerns over valuations having split away from underlying corporate and economic fundamentals, few fund managers have been willing to challenge the market by placing outright shorts. ‚Äú\n\nHowever, ‚Äúsophisticated investors‚Äù are expressing their cautious views with the use of derivatives, and El-Erian says the mom-and-pop types should take note.\n\n‚ÄúIt is hard to overstate the extent of today‚Äôs risk-taking in U.S. financial markets,‚Äù he wrote, pointing to the explosive moves in a small number of high-flyers, such as Apple AAPL, +3.98%, Tesla TSLA, -4.67% and Amazon AMZN, +1.39%.\n\n‚ÄúMuch of this could be seen as market deepening were it not for one troubling fact: corporate and economic fundamentals have yet to reflect a sustained and convincing recovery from COVID-related damage,‚Äù he said. The rebound in consumption is slowing, initial jobless claims are back to the 1 million level for a second straight week, bankruptcies are rising, and, according to El-Erian, it‚Äôs looking like these short-term disruptions are about to become long-term scars.\n\n‚ÄúRather than a well-thought-out bet on the future, stocks reflect many investors‚Äô resolute faith in a consistently favourable and predictable liquidity environment,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúIt is a backdrop anchored by reliable stimulus from central banks.‚Äù\n\nOn the surface, the same can pretty much be said for what we‚Äôre seeing in the derivatives market, but there‚Äôs more to it than just that.\n\n‚ÄúThe fear of missing out on an unceasing equity rally has increasingly been expressed through call options,‚Äù El-Erian said. ‚ÄúThose who would normally short the market on concerns of excessive valuations appear to have no desire to be steamrollered once again by favourable liquidity and the strong ‚Äòbuy-the-dip‚Äô conditioning that comes with that.‚Äù\n\nHe pointed out that buying call options limits risk and gives traders the ability to take strategic shots at capturing rallies. At the same time, the smart money is hedging bets with downside ‚Äútail protection‚Äù to guard against the inevitable sharp declines. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre seeing the VIX volatility gauge VIX, -1.09% decouple from equities, another sign, according to El-Erian, that retail investors are particularly vulnerable when the sellers take the upper hand.\n\n‚ÄúIt would take a big shock for markets to move significantly lower ‚Äî such as a renewed sharp economic downturn, a considerable monetary or fiscal policy mistake, or market defaults and liquidity accidents,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúBut should such a move occur, the likelihood of further market turmoil would be high, especially given the current lack of a short base to buffer the downturn. This exposes small retail investors to big potential losses.‚Äù\n\nNo sign of the dying of the bull Tuesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.75%, Nasdaq Composite COMP, +1.39% and S&P 500 SPX, +0.75% moving higher. \n\nhttps://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-pros-are-getting-ready-for-a-market-crash-retail-investors-not-so-much-top-economist-warns-11598970447?mod=home-page", "id": "il1hjq", "created_utc": 1599027156.0, "score": 62, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 85, "comments": [{"body": "No one predicted the market would be this retarded right now.

Your sold call is covered by the one you bought. You can roll the short call out and up if things get dicy. Always roll in one operation. I sold a Sept 18 670c for 5.2. I expect it to expire worthless but I'll probably close it on expiry day since there could be an ah surge given the underlying. Delta was .14 I think at the time of the trade. Your longer dated call will always gain more value than the shorter dated one at the higher strike you sold. Look up diagonal spreads. You have to manage them more but good rewards for pushing phone buttons.\n\nI am not suggesting turning this into a standard debit spread with both options having the same expiry.\n\nEdit: I said I'd let the short call expire worthless but if I get 75 percent of the value or so before then I'll probably roll it for more time value.
