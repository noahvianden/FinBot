The 780 put may have cost 401 and the 800 put gave a premium of 420.9 (made up numbers but probably close). So when they placed the order they received 19.90 in credit. Then there are 3 scenarios to close. \n\n1. Tesla closes below 780. They buy shares at 780 from the put they purchased and then immediately sell them at 800 for the put they sold. They lose 20/share on the sale but made 19.90/share on premium. Overall, they lose .1/share or $10.  \n\n2. Tesla closes above 780 (for example 790). The put they bought expires worthless. The put they sold they now owe these shares at 800 so they buy shares at 790 and sell them at 800 taking a $10 loss per share. So they collect a premium of 19.90 and take a loss of 10/share giving them 9.90/share. \n\n3. Tesla closes above 800. Both puts expire worthless and they keep the premium gap giving the max gain of 1990. \n\nBreakeven in the scenario is if tesla hits 780.1 by expiration.  Clearly, that is not happening even on tesla with it's wild swings. They now are assigned on the put they sold and had to buy 100 shares of tesla at 800/share.

I think there is risk that they are now on margin and their brokerage could charge them since they just spent $80000 on shares technically on margin. The brokerage shouldn't do this though because they brokered the trade and know that they can exercise their leg to sell at 780.  \n\nIf you are actively managing this I think he could have profited by waiting till the stock is headed down, closing his short put (the one he sold) and then closing his long leg at a lower price.
