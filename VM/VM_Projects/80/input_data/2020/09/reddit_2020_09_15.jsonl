My Discover Bank was offering a balance transfer of up to my credit limit which is $19,400 at a 3% fee and no interest until 12 months has passed and the balance hasn’t been re-payed. I took out a $5,000 loan with an upfront fee of $150 or 3%. I plan on investing this money into Apple, Tesla and QQQ with hopes that the return at the very least is 4% on that $5,000 to break even on the loan after IRS takes their taxes on those gains within the following year. I anticipate getting much more than 4% return on that $5,000 within a year which will effectively net me a profit. I’m new to investing and I believe this action is called investing on margin. I chose a $5,000 loan, because the monthly amount to pay it back within a year fits in my budget and I can stomach losing that much money as opposed to going all out with my $19,400 credit limit in which I can’t afford to lose that.
