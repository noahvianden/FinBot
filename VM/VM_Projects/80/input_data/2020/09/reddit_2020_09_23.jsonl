Finally there are the proven market leaders with great fundamentals and huge war chests (AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, etc.). Are these overvalued? Maybe. It’s hard to say. Probably everything is. But with the progressing economic crisis and increasing belt tightening (both at the consumer and industry levels), these companies are positioned to gobble up their competitors and expand as everyone else contracts. \n\nThe above is all very similar to the dot-com bubble. But that shouldn’t really be a surprise since they’re pretty much always present in the market to varying degrees. What is different are the underlying, structural issues:\n1. Similar to 2000, there’s definitely a bubble driven by inexperienced traders playing with options (which tech in particular is riding). \n2. Based on Fed policies, stocks are pretty much the only place for huge firms and the *very* wealthy to park their money and still make gains. \n3. COVID has hit a lot of small businesses, people are out of work, rents and mortgages are still coming due, state and local budgets are stretched paper thin, federal aid has dried up. So consumption, the driver of earnings, is going to slow.
