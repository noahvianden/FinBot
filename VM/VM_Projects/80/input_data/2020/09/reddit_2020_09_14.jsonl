{"title": "How have you changed as an investor in 2020?", "selftext": "How have you evolved as an investor as a result of the confusion of 2020? Personally I've done through the following modes\n\n* Started investing in 1999, did everything wrong, like buying that great Janus fund that was up 39% last year? RIP me.\n* Had no-name \"advisors\" doing absolutely nothing for me for a few years\n* When I got enough money to get my own named advisor with Wells Fargo, things went \"well\" — I was able to take part in the recovery after the GFC, though of course I was paying him 1.4% to manage my stocks, and he was buying funds with 0.8-1.5% expense fees. When he talked me out of buying AMZN at $450, I fired him, figuring I can make my own mistakes and save the 1.4% fee.\n* So I moved everything over to Fidelity in 2015 and did well, mostly using iShares funds but owning some individual stocks I thought I understood. But while I know a Boglehead-style buy and hold strategy will work for me in the end, I was interested in learning about quantitative ways I could know when I should or should not be in the market, perhaps using tools like The Investor's Podcast has, a momentum tool that can provide basic buy or sell signals, which is really cool. \n\nI decided to try to properly try to learn to understand chart functions like RSI, MACD and understand for myself when I should be buying stocks and staying away. I joined [StockCharts.com](https://StockCharts.com) and watch the content they put out on Youtube, which is very helpful at understanding the ideas and reinforcing things nicely. This will hopefully keep me from saying \"Oh, AT&T fell 10%, I guess it's a buy\" when it clearly isn't, and that I shouldn't be holding those shares of DAL in February of 2020. \n\nHere's an example chart of SPY, since we can't embed images into posts here. I really love the things you can do with this platform. \n\n[https://imgur.com/a/S8JGaZa](https://imgur.com/a/S8JGaZa)\n\nYou can do things like organize your portfolio and sort by RSI so you can see trends and understand things you shouldn't be holding. And set up default charts to go to when things crash, so you don't feel \n\n[https://imgur.com/a/1IrBBZv](https://imgur.com/a/1IrBBZv)\n\nSo bottom line, I'm going to try to avoid allowing huge drawdowns on my \"buy and hold\" stocks going forward. Which sounds like common knowledge, but I was a Boglehead for so long, it takes a while to unlearn it all.\n\nTell us how your investing style has changed this year!", "id": "isgghn", "created_utc": 1600069125.0, "score": 43, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 80, "comments": [{"body": "Flipping a coin to make investment decisions is no worse than basing them on technical and fundamental analyses.", "score": 27, "replies": [{"body": "I’d say yes, to a degree.

Also i was not worried at all when seeing my investments in the red, which made me realize that i could handle the risk psychologically (very important!).

We all know how that turned out so far 🤡. I invested for a quick flip and i don't even like the company. At first it rallied quite well, but eventually it lost a lot of steam.
