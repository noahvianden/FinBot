{"title": "Time to buy calls on 3x leveraged ETFs and go full retard", "selftext": "Good Morning Autists,  \n\n\nI rarely show trades here because I don't want to be the reason 3,000 degenerates make or lose money but after you all gave me a shite ton of positive feedback from my last post about that bullish bearish artwork, I decided to give the WSB community a bearish idea.  \n\n\nFirst off, listening to strangers on the internet for investing ideas is a fantastic idea.  I also know a guy that lives by the river that likes to hand out special candy before sleeping it off inside his van.  Please don't be this stupid and do your own 33 seconds of DD on robinhood.  And no, DD does not include typing in the symbol to see if you can trade it or not.  \n\n\nSo here's my full retard idea.  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Behold the power of the squiggles](https://preview.redd.it/yqydbrejt3m51.jpg?width=1896&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=80710c27fddcc0c270be63c045b14b0afe990444)\n\n  \nSo this is SPY.  If you don't know what that is, it's because you've been with TSLA too long.  This is the biggest ETF in the world.  The thick white lines are the rising channels and the yellow line is the previous top in feb 2020 which also caused a brief pause in august 2020.  Finally, the white and blue lines are the 21 and 30 EMA.  Why those numbers?  Because I started trading at 21 and should have quit by 30.  \n\n\nSo here's what I'm seeing.  I'm only a small gay bear in the pool of rising bottom callers because we've been 3 days down and stonks only go up.  So I'm almost definitely wrong here.  But what I'm seeing is when the last drop happened, we had to break that channel on some heavy volume, and then the MA's showed the way.  \n\n\nThe first time that happened in february, it was a brutal reversal that shook out almost every gay bear and let the bullish diamond hands think they had defeated the gay bears to live forever as kings.  The bulls quickly realized it was a shenanigan all along and with both sides a$$'s handed to them, everything rolled.  \n\n\nFast forward to now.    \n\n\nThis time, we broke out above old ATH's and all the bears shorting all the way up have been defeated by YOLOing millenials on robinhood.  Life is grand for all.  However, one thing most people don't talk about, is that when a stonk breaks an ATH, it's a very bad sign to see it close back below that ATH on heavy volume.  That's changed it from a strong retest at old high's to a failure at old highs.  \n\n\nAdd to that it's done so on heavy volume (it's yellow when it's more than 1.5x average, because I couldn't just color in bigger volume with a crayon so I had to code a little), and it's closed below the 21 and 30 emas.  \n\n\nSo if the fit really has hit the shan, I'm going full retard.  The upside is with softbank now being the scape goat everyone needs but not deserves, we now have a reason to die.  The reasons were all already there but it was being ignored.  But on a slightly more serious note, the # of stocks beating estimates and finally not continuing higher is important, it is showing sentiment is shifting.  \n\n\nSo when I say full retard, I mean my type of full retard.  One that risks 2% on a trade and looks to make his year.  This is full retard for me because it's not in my plan at all, and I shouldn't be doing this.  When Stan from accounting says full retard on WSB it's because he's putting all $8,000 of his grandma's inheritance on TSLA 500 YOLO calls expiring friday, but at the end of the day we'll both lose, I just won't have to drink my tears for supper.  But you do you.  \n\n\n  \nTL ; DR ?  \n\n\nFine.  SPXU (Triple Leveraged short SPY) trading calls.  That gives me 3x overall leverage and then I'm trading it with calls which gives me 100 shares for 1 call, or even though it's not accurate, in WSB math, 300x Leverage.  CheckMate.  \n\n\nSPXU Oct 16 2020 $11 calls.  If market closes back over 21 ema, stop past that bar's high or jump.  If market doesn't stop bleeding, it could be a terrible month and this will be a solid insurance/trade/YOLO experience, just depending on who you are.  Probably won't post where I punch it unless it's so bad or so good I need to show off the porn.  \n\n\nAnd last, this will probably fail.  Do your own DD, I'm not your investment advisor, blah blah blah.  Good luck gay bears.  here's hoping we can make $100,000 so we can switch back to the next meme stock aka TSLA Battery Day.", "id": "ipe0ji", "created_utc": 1599650534.0, "score": 200, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 85, "comments": [{"body": "Would be more tempted if you made the chart look like a cute animal", "score": 174, "replies": [{"body": "It’s a lightning bolt, not fancy enough?", "score": 18, "replies": [{"body": "Better; its DOUBLE lightning bolts.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I have a ticker that’s cooler anyway : TNA", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "No I  said TNE", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "i prefer “retard” pattern", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "We’re in an EKG market now", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Have you ever made love to a man?", "score": 66, "replies": [{"body": "it’s not love when the man is jpowell", "score": 17, "replies": [{"body": "Do you mean it's not gay when the man is jpowell", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "It's not love until you reach the elbow", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "This is great but have you noticed that the IV of SPXU is >3x that of SPY so you don't get more leverage you just buy a crappy option.
