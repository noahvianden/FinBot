I am here to encourage you not to do that. There is hope.\n\nOne thing I have always relied on to tell me whats next is the Relative Strength Index. It shows when a stock is overbought/oversold. Right now, SPY, TQQQ, every single stock is just coming down to that middle point. They were being severely overbought for a few weeks.\n\nDo not worry as it will not go down further than it has today. We have weathered the worst of the storm. It still could take a month before we are back in full motion but stay in there. It hurts like hell but we will make it through this together.\n\nTo Valhalla brothers!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**tl;dr The sell off is done.

As of yesterday it was 57.63 9/3/2020. At close today I promise that will be 50 even. And from there, we go up.\n\n# Look at the RSI before the June 11th crash and the RSI yesterday:\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.profitspi.com\\/stock\\/view.aspx?v=stock-chart&uv=100563&p=SPY](https://preview.redd.it/7tzckenfl5l51.png?width=656&format=png&auto=webp&s=06c4246baf371141f66a458c3fe5941ded23554b)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHopefully this gives you a little hope that it will be okay.
