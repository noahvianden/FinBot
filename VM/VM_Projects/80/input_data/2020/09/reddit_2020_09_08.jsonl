Since AAPL's been having these red days, I got in on the 120c's for November.  I know we have a few upcoming catalysts - \n\n1. iPad and Apple Watch event, which is coming soon apparently.\n2. iPhone 12 launch event, which is apparently its first 5g phone, so that should be exciting.\n\nTSLA was another stock that underwent the split, but I think AAPL has better fundamentals, and looking at their business model, I think they should still go up in the near future.\n\nSorry I don't have any DD or anything, but I wanted to check on how others are planning on playing AAPL in the next months. I couldn't find a post where people were just talking about AAPL, so I thought I'd just make one.\n\nWhat do you people think ? What are your AAPL positions ?
