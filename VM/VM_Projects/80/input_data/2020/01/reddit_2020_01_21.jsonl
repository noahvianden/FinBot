They are not a software company that spends  capex and dev costs to launch a piece of software to 1 or 1 billion  users and amortize the cost over years.\n\nI mean media creation for a streaming platform is pretty similar isn't it? Netflix spends money to create a new show and then the cost to launch that to 1 subscriber vs 1 billion is basically just the server costs. Netflix then amortizes the cost of their new IP on an accelerated basis over 10 years (I think, it's either 5 or 10).\n\nNetflix is actually an outlier among media studios in that they do accelerated amortization instead of straight-line, so their EPS would actually be higher if they followed the industry standard.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>On the conference call, Ted just said they will  spend 20% more on content in 2020. You think at some point, they will  stop and just stream re-runs?\n\nYou're right, I doubt they will start spending less, but I think their spending will become more efficient.\n\nI guess my thinking is that as Netflix moves forward, they will establish more tried-and-true popular IP like Stranger Things. If they manage to have 4 or 5 ongoing cash-cow series, then they can be a lot more efficient with their spending. Like $5mil on Stranger Things will generate a lot more views than $5mil on Sense8 or some other new IP. So yeah they might not spend *less* if they're goal is to keep expanding the amount of new content produced each year, but they'll get more bang for their buck and their service will be higher quality for the same cost as time goes on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Netfix's only hope of profitability is increasing subs and APU to offset the cash burn.\n\nYeah this is the bottom line. Netflix seems pretty close to saturation in the US market and how much they can raise subscription fees before it decreases revenue is definitely up for question. But the US is their most mature market and imo even if domestic growth stagnated and prices didn't change, it's still a promising model if this is how international markets will mature as well.\n\nIt's something like 60% of Americans that have Netflix and the price has been increased considerably since the early days of the service.
