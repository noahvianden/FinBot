Said we need to protect our great geniuses and cherish them\n* [Tesla] Shocking how it's come so fast. Go back a year and they were talking about the end of the company, now they're talking about these great things.\n* **\"[Musk] is going to be building a very big plant in the US. He has to. Because we help him, so he has to help us.\"**\n\nSupporting ideas:\n\n1. I could see Trump fumbling a leak of this nature.\n2. For Trump, it's a win. It shows how he turned a subsidy into a new factory/jobs.*\n3. For Tesla, it's also a win. Shows the critics that yes, the subsidy helped, but now Tesla is doing the right thing and paying back.*\n\n\\* I don't agree with the underlying truth behind these statements. But from a political optics perspective, these statements make sense and I think neither Tesla nor Trump would have a problem playing it this way.", "id": "esas7t", "created_utc": 1579693376.0, "score": 76, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 79, "comments": [{"body": "Maybe it was a reference to Gigafactory 1?

Trump was doing what he usually does and says what he wants someone to do as though they are already doing it without telling them to do it. This is also a roundabout way of carrying the criticism of Tesla \"living off the taxpayers\" through subsidies, when in fact Tesla paid off green loan years ago and is subsided less than fossil fuel vehicles.   Also, this request for a factory is based on Trump's perception of the reality of good business, vs what is the reality of good business. For example just look at his support of coal, when in fact power producers cant uses coal competitively. I suspect he also wants to tie his brand to Tesla's success.  Effectively his comment was \"Elon Musk better build a big plant in the US because I helped him. Isn't it great how successful we both are? We are good businessmen. \"\n\nWhat is very interesting to me is that Tesla has become such an American economic powerhouse globally that it cannot be ignored anymore by both industries (Bob Lutz \"Tesla is finally doing what I was always saying they should be doing (paraphrased)\" and politicians (Trump's comments).", "score": 11, "replies": []}, {"body": "Here's just the Elon bit on YouTube:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxEwTFJG1DQ\n\nIt's funny how Trump tries to think of another American innovative genius after he's named Thomas Edison ... and then remembers the American genius who invented the wheel.", "score": 29, "replies": [{"body": "The wheel was truly Americas great gift to the world", "score": 11, "replies": []}, {"body": "Thanks for that!
