But each time, there was a positive catalyst that forced shorts to cover and caused a short squeeze since they had to buy back their shorts at higher prices. First it was an analyst re-rating it to a buy even at the new high price, now it's the long anticipated earnings\n\nThe Tesla rally is completely justified based on the news that's come out. However, the sheer size of the rally was exaggerated by how unexpected not only one bit of news was, but a consistent chain of unexpected positive surprises. And all these positive surprises ended up being such big catalysts to the upside because it was all in the context of leading into today's earnings, as it became more and more apparent that last earnings wasn't a fluke and this earnings will be in line when many hedge funds did not think TSLA would post such an amazing beat again. \n\nNow as a result of this beat, TSLA is priced to absolute perfection. Bears are fucking hungry and ready to sink their claws back in. My prediction is that tomorrow we might see one final short squeeze as shorts are forced to cover their positions, after which hedge funds load heavy shorts at $698 to prevent TSLA from hitting $700, and will proceed to start successfully driving TSLA's stock price down for half the time between now and the next earnings report. At the same time, as shorts are covering, many many people might take profit at this price level since there is no more anticipated catalyst (i.e. earnings) on the timeline any time soon. So we really might not even see a huge short squeeze tomorrow as profit taking might cap the upside.", "score": 65, "replies": [{"body": "whats this saying for the people on this sub that don't know how to read", "score": 42, "replies": [{"body": "800 calls", "score": 41, "replies": [{"body": "2/21 800 calls got it", "score": 26, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I know how to read but I saw all that text and moved on", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "800 calls", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "Have you seen this [forbes ](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chuckjones/2020/01/25/teslas-accelerating-stock-price-hasnt-been-driven-by-a-short-squeeze/#63264464673c) article that claims this most recent run up hasn’t been shorts covering but longs adding to their holdings?\n\n\n“Surprisingly, the multi-month Tesla squeeze has taken a breather even as Tesla’s stock price rallied over 38% in 2020.
