They're mostly free riding on ISP's, especially outside America.  They haven't built much of anything physical at all.  They have done loads of localized IP and content wheeling and dealing, but that's not physical or infrastructure in any way.\n\nIt's also weird that you'd use Netflix - which is a perpetual money losing operation - to try and say that's how Disney will make money.

They're both streaming entertainment, and unlike Netflix, Disney has merchandising, theme parks and successful box office outings. Sidenote: you seemed to get stuck on DVDs for some reason, but those are a thing of the past- anyone in the entertainment industry can tell you that. It's a small, nostalgic market that fuels DVD sales for the most part. No serious entertainment company is putting any resources into that.\n\nYour math is also wrong as far as subscriptions go. It's not 6.99. It's 6.99/month, in perpetuity, forever. That is WAY better for a business model than a one time purchase of $30.\n\nEDIT: For the purposes of your argument, you are also conveniently leaving out the arms of the Disney empire that print money. Theme park ticket costs have risen exponentially for years. Merchandising is a multi billion dollar business. And because Disney specifically targets kids, they are building brand loyalty (which you are grossly underestimating in your equation). It is intangible, but a factor nonetheless. I can't think of any other children's brand with the amount of adult support (ie $) that Disney has.

Or maybe you are \"misremembering\".  Read their legal disclosures.  Any nanoscopic offices they have are mostly there for regulatory or mandatory and licensing reasons.

That office is an atom on a molecule on a pin on a hair on a hippo on a planet in a solar system in a galaxy.
