This is what I said when the stock was at $300 and going down to $180 and after tripling down, thinking it's just obvious what the future will be, apparently it takes a while for the mainstream to realize this. The 80% gain this year is the mainstream starting to accept that EVs are the future and buying an ICE car is stupid in 2020, plus that all other automakers are completely incompetent at making autonomous EVs. \n\n> Also claiming today’s high price makes sense because of future growth only makes sense of the stock never moves higher from now on... \n\nNo, even if a stock is based 100% on future value, there's always risk and discounted future earnings to consider. Money next week is always better than money next year. As time goes on that future value can be realized and stock goes up. Then there's risk and uncertainty, a 10% chance to earn $1,000 should be valued at $100. If it's a completely random event then immediately following the event the value will either go to $0 or $1,000 depending on the outcome. For Tesla there's the entire energy business, autonomy, battery tech that's riddled in uncertainty and if you believe/have insight that they have a higher chance to succeed than the consensus, then that's free money. \n\nIf the 10% chance to earn $1,000 is in reality 20%, then that's a huge opportunity to invest, as everyone else realizes this the value will increase from $100 to $200.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": ">auto industry... car maker\n\nNot sure you get what Tesla is doing here, but it ain't just making cars.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "> Even though Elon said on Q4 call he expects 50% growth annually.\n\nJust last year around this time Elon also said profitable all quarters going forward then posted a loss the next quarter.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Ark's analysis wasn't based entirely on current sales, though.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "You can't base on revenue.

Tesla selling 5x more cars is not the same as Apple selling 5x more iphones.\n\nFor each iPhone Apple makes A LOT of profit, somewhere like paying $250 for it and selling it for $1,000. On top of that the iPhone user might get iCloud subscription and buy Apps on the AppStore, giving Apple revenue without costs. Lots of it too.\n\nWhen it comes to Tesla the profit margins are much different. First, each car sold has lower margins than each iPhone sold. On top of that the additional revenue like supercharger use has a lot of costs to operate: electricity and land. The more people charge the more it costs Tesla. It’s not true for software downloads, one extra download is almost nothing in terms of costs.\n\nFinally when you look at Tesla’s revenue by business type selling cars is the overwhelming majority. This means that until it diversifies it’s revenue (and most importantly profit), it should be priced like a car company. Car companies at best have a 1.0 sales/price ratio. Looking at that Tesla should be worth $25 Billion, or less.\n\nTo justify the same sales/prices ratio as Apple Tesla must prove its car sales generate the same profit margins as iPhones plus that a substantial side revenue exists which also has killer profits (little costs, lots of revenue). Oh and it must scale: yes if you sell $100,000 cars your margins will be great, but that isn’t sustainable as very few people can buy them. We must look at the sub $35,000 price range, if they have great profits Tesla with just them + supercharger that is profitable and a self driving subscription can justify a 2.0-3.0 sales/price ratio (assuming great profits from supercharger and selling the self driving subscription), but Elon said otherwise, and it not being sold yet means it’s not even profitable yet...supercharger breaks even...self driving is a one time buy right now...", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I agree completely.
