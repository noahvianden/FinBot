You and another person can place the same market order at the same time and end up with wildly different prices. You can place limit trades that get traded through and not get executed. Many trades are negotiated off exchange (this is true during market hours too, but those trades are still held to the NBBO quote where as in after hours they are not). Liquidity can be sparse and movement in both directions is rapid and not necessarily reflective of a price in a competitive market. If you do see a quoted price from someone, they are not necessarily obligated to execute with you if you try to trade against it.
