That means whoever they are borrowing the shares from also is not selling/trading them because they are on loan. When they get margin called they have to buy shares from someone who did NOT loan their shares out. This is why this is called a short squeeze. \n\nAlso I just checked your numbers. Bloomberg is reporting about 25mm shares are short so at the last tick that's worth $21.75b that needs to be covered right now, and that number only rises as the stock goes up. As these people buy back to cover, they are creating the vicious cycle of pushing the stock even higher margin calling even more shorts.

I mean, sure maybe, I just am not seeing these numbers add up.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "142mm shares float. 25mm of that is short, meaning they borrowed from people who are long out of that 142mm and then sold it to other people who are now long. Effectively 25mm shares EXTRA have been traded that don't actually exist. When the stock goes up, most longs don't sell. The person who is short is paying a large interest rate to borrow those shares on top of the losses they're taking in the market. Tesla is the most shorted stock in the market which means the interest charge will be amongst the highest in the market. When they get margin called, they are forced to buy shares back. The 25mm shares that they borrowed from are unlikely to sell. They're making phat interest on top of the price appreciation for the shares they lended out. Most of the big institutional owners have only been adding positions in Tesla not selling. Names like Baillie Gifford who owns 13.8mm. Vanguard and BlackRock that owns almost 8mm and 6.4mm for their various mutual funds. Many other institutions own it too, most adding not selling shares. Then you have large individual investors, like Oracle CEO Larry Ellison who owns 3mm shares just by himself. Do you see how the supply of shares people are willing to trade rapidly evaporates? Keep in mind Elon himself owns 34mm shares and only ever sells small amounts to pay taxes, then usually buys them right back later. These big shorts have to find someone willing to sell them shares, and LOTS of them. The longer they wait to find a seller the worse it gets for them and they're still paying brutal interest. \n\nShorts have unlimited loss potential and limited gain potential. It's amazing how few people understand this bias. You have to be way more informed about a short position than you do a long position. A lot of people on Reddit think shorting is a game like trading in and out of stocks on a whim. Then something like this happens and people get a reality check on how this shit really works. There were 10 years leading up to today where people were predicting the iminent death of Tesla. Very powerful, loud, respected people like Bob Lutz, many hedge fund managers, news talking heads, and analysts. People need to understand these talking heads all have a financial interest in lying about Tesla as much as possible. They lie about Tesla's safety, battery tech, financials, or software (sometimes all of these at the same time). In December Morgan Stanley's bear case for Tesla was a valuation of $10 / sh. \"Legendary billionaire investor\" Jim Chanos went on CNBC to layout why he thought Tesla was worthless. \n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2017/12/14/jim-chanos-we-think-tesla-is-worth-zero.html\n\nWatching that interview now if you actually research anything about Tesla's product  or business you realize all of that was just blatant lies. He was using his media platform to bet short against the company and profit off the stock selloff as a result of his media spot. \n\nPeople talk about Bulls getting overhyped.
