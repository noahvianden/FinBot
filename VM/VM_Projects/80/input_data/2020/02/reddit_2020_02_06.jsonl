I'm still not quite sure of the mechanism of how this potentially worked from that post.", "score": 23, "replies": [{"body": "I‚Äôll give you an example:\n\nIn June when the stock price was $180 Fred (being a very astute Tesla fan) realized, it was fundamentally very underpriced.  Rather than buying more shares, he decides to buy call options at $750 / share that expire Feb. 7th.  XYZ institution makes a lot of money by capitalizing on irrational dreamers like Fred.  They looked at their data and realized no large company ever has stock that goes up 4X in less than a year.  So they‚Äôre willing to sell Fred 10k options at $0.15 each.  \n\nEach option gives Fred the right to buy 100 shares of Tesla from XYZ at $750 any time over the next 8 months.  So:\n\neach option costs Fred $0.15 * 100 = $15.  \n10k  options cost Fred $150k.  \n\nThey give him the right to buy 1M shares of Tesla anytime on or before Feb. 7th for $750.  \n\nFred‚Äôs breakeven point on the stock is $750.15.  He would buy the 1M shares at $700, sell them at $700.15 and get his initial $150k back.  \n\nHowever if Tesla is at $1500 per share Friday, Fred buys the 1M shares from XYZ for $750, resells them for $1500 and makes $750M!\n\nXYZ institution is sitting there in June feeling very happy with the $150k they got from Fred.  Easy money!\n\nIn July TSLA goes back in the $200‚Äôs but XYZ is not that nervous.\n\nTesla releases the surprise Q3 results and Tesla soon jumps into the $300‚Äôs .\n\nNow XYZ is a little nervous, so they buy 50k shares of Tesla stock.  That way at least as Tesla rises, they‚Äôre protected a little in their bet, because they‚Äôll have some of those shares, plus those shares appreciate, so it would mitigate their loss to Fred.\n\nTesla releases q4 and the stock jumps again.  Now XYZ buys 200k shares of Tesla.   XYZ and other institutions are now continually buying shares to hedge their bet against people like Fred, just in case they have to give him 1M shares below market value.  \n\nIronically this is happening to such a large extent, this hedging causes the stock price to rise again and causes XYZ to buy even more shares!  They‚Äôre now caught in a positive feedback loop where this call hedging, plus shorts covering, is causing TSLA to skyrocket, gaining more and more each day.\n\nNow it‚Äôs Wednesday and TSLA is shooting up to over a $200 gain in one day following a $100 gain the day before.  Poor XYZ has only bought 300k shares, but come Friday, they‚Äôre going to have to sell Fred 1M shares.  They now know they are looking at a $750M loss to Fred, but maybe even worse, if the positive feed back loop accelerates.  \n\nSo they decide to illegally force Tesla down.  The problem is that if they do it more than 15 minutes before close, it will trigger a rule that will prevent them from continuing the next day.  So 13 minutes before close they borrow 2M shares and sell them for lower prices than they‚Äôre worth to immediately stop Tesla‚Äôs momentum and drive the price down.  They know lots of nervousTesla shareholders set limits in the $900‚Äôs to lock in their gains, and so they can start a reaction where those investors will automatically sell and the price will drop under $900 / share.  \n\nFortunately XYZ also has ties with MarketWatch, so they also get an article published with the false headline Tesla negative for the day, within the 13 minute window (even though after the $80.00 manufactured price drop still left Tesla positive for the day).  They know that bots are programmed automatically to sell on headlines like this, so it‚Äôs a wonderful technique!  And of course the article can be removed minutes after trading.  No harm done, right:-)\n\nNow early yesterday morning they can sell more shares in the small German index and drive the price down further very easily, and spook lots of investors and cause everyone to sell and drive the price to the $700‚Äôs.  Now slowly they can buy back the 2M shares at $750 that they borrowed at $950 and make a very nice profit of $400M.\n\nOn Friday, Tesla will close at $748 and Fred will get $0.00.  XYZ pockets Fred‚Äôs $150k and they win again.  They know there‚Äôs no risk, because the SEC never prosecutes stuff like this.\n\nTHE END", "score": 188, "replies": [{"body": "This is the first time I've been able to understand stock options trading.

I hadn't considered selling calls against the leaps until it was pointed out by another user u/veliladon. It's also generally easier to roll out the covered calls and manage essentially 1 position as opposed to managing the QQQs constantly. The LEAPs are up like 20% already, so I can benefit from collecting an extra like 1-2k worth of credit every few weeks to lower the cost basis of the LEAPs.\n\nSelling covered calls on LEAPs is actually a strategy called [Fig Leaf](https://www.optionsplaybook.com/option-strategies/leveraged-covered-call/), or a leveraged covered call / LEAPs diagonal spread.\n\nThe Theta for the position is negligible, so I'm not too worried about it until much later on.\n\nAs for the overall goal, I plan on exercising some of the positions later on and longing shares at a lower cost basis.
