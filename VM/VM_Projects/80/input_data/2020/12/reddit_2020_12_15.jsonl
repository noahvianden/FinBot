But here's the really, really quick version\n\n - GME's biggest assets are retail storefronts and staff, e-commerce growth, and leveraging the massive membership program they still have\n\n - GME's revenues have been declining partly because of digitization and partly because of the waning console cycle\n\n - the main bear thesis before 2H/20 was that Gamestop was going bankrupt before the new consoles – they aren't, not any time soon - the new console cycle will provide a huge infusion of cash for Gamestop to modernize their business\n\n - if revenues stabilize and the business is modernized along the lines of other successful specialty retailers like Best Buy, the market cap would be *significantly* higher (2-5x)\n\n This last point requires a strong management team and a lot of cash, and I've been forced to lower my probability on it because Sherman has been cagey about the details of the turnaround. He promises to reveal more in the coming months.\n\n Now, there's also two big weird factors at play.\n\n - 140% short interest. There are more shorts than shares outstanding. By a lot. Gamestop is the most shorted stock in the world, on any exchange.\n\n - Ryan Cohen. Billionaire founder of Chewy has bought a 10% stake, hired a mergers-and-acquisitions specialized lawyer, and started sending angry letters to the Board with lines such as \"won't be satisfied with a lone board seat\".\n\n Personally, I think the highest upside comes from Cohen.
