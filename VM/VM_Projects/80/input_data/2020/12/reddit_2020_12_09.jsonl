{"title": "üöÄüöÄüöÄ C3.AI is the real gold here ya'll but not at the current price üöÄüöÄüöÄ", "selftext": "Fk [C3.Ai](https://C3.Ai) with such retarded opening i really hope that it crashes and burns after the hype so we all can pick it up cheap. At this point im not expecting any ipos to be cheap just purely based on the hype were seeing right now. But here is just a DD i did for it. The company has **an interesting business model in which that the company will partner up with another company to create an application that is proven to increase efficiency, reduce cost, track measurements for analysis purposes and so on and will then proceed to sell the same implementation to other companies that may benefit from the applications**. The revenue is mainly based on the subscription models to create steady stream of revenue. The company is lead by Tom Siebel, the pioneer of the customer relationship management software business that sold his company to Oracle for 6 billion in 2006 and C3.AI is his next level creation to revolutionize the world. **C3.AI is listed as one of the top disruptors of 2020 is backed up by Microsoft and spring creek capital with 50 million of stocks and $ 100 million investment respectively. C3.AI announced the partnership with Raytheon Technologies to develop AI solutions for aerospace and defense missions for government customers, including the U.S. Air Force and intelligence community. They also announced partnership with Microsoft and Adobe for a new customer ‚Äì relationship management software seeking to comeback Salesforce INC.** The potential **for C3.AI is limitless because of how broad the scope can be. With a successful implementation of an application, C3.AI could easily spin it off to implement such applications to other industries with incredible scalability and tremendous reduction to developing cost**. Before we dive into what the company actually does, here is the overview of the company. \n\n**Financial wise, the company has**\n\n\\- **A whopping 71% yoy growth**\n\n\\- **86% subscription revenue**\n\n\\- **A $271 billion TAM by 2024.** \n\n\\- **Narrowing income loss thanks to the rapid growth**\n\n**The AI technology is a proven technology and is one that is being used daily to help industries moving faster into digital transformation. The currently capability and usage of the AI software is as followed** \n\n\\- **Make 1.1Billion predictions per day**\n\n\\- **Has 4.8million machine learning models in production use**\n\n\\- **Has 622 million sensors generating data for the C3.AI suite**\n\n\\- **Has 770 unique enterprise and extraprise source data integration** \n\n\\- **Has 50 Million businesses and consumers touched daily**\n\n**Notable market successes:**\n\n\\- **Banks are able to enhance securities lending optimization with estimated value of 14 billion in additional daily trades deployed in 52 weeks**\n\n\\- **Healthcare managements are able to enhance production optimization with estimated value of 300% increase in unit production deployed in 4 weeks**\n\n\\- **Oil and gas companies are able to predictive maintenance for offshore oil rigs and is able to recapture $28million per year in avoided shutdowns** \n\nWhat is C3.AI\n\nC3.ai is an enterprise AI software company that provides software as a service, applications that enable the rapid deployment of enterprise AI applications of extraordinary scale and complexity that offer significant social and economic benefit. \n\n**Two primary software solutions:**\n\n**1.** **C3 AI suite: designed to allow customers to apply design, develop, and deploy enterprise AI application to any type (basically a platform that allows you to develop your own applications)**\n\n**2.** **C3 AI Application: include a large and growing family of industry specific and application specific turnkey Ai solutions that can be immediately installed and deployed (a prebuilt application that is ready to go for implementations)**\n\nThe market entry growth strategy of C3.AI is focus on partnering and coordinating with lighthouse customers (the big companies including AWS, Baker Huges, FIS, Google, IBM and Microsoft) to create a proven and scalable applications that work to increase efficiency, cut down on costs and to record measurements on a massive scale for analysis purposes. With the established applications. \n\n**C3.AI is then able to** \n\n**1.** **Expand those same use cases across similar companies**\n\n**2.** **Establish middle market sales organizations, including tele sales, and online sales**\n\n**3.** **Leverage on marketing partners as enterprise and mid-market distribution channels**\n\nReal world user case:\n\nEngie ‚Äì largest power producer in the world with\n\n\\- 114.4 GW power production capacity\n\n\\- $67 billion annual revenue in europoors money\n\n\\- 153k employees, operated in 70 counties \n\nWith the partnership with Engie, C3.Ai developed and deployed performance optimization for gas power plants, efficiency optimization of heating and cooling plants, energy analysis and management for enterprise and consumer customers, and anomaly detection of wind turbines. **C3 was able to bring the scalability required to build industrial AI based application with over 1million sensors, 5 million end points and 17mil measurements per day with the end result of bringing estimated 1.5 billion in annual economic benefits**\n\n\\- Wind turbines with in 12 weeks of deployment sees 2-3% increase in performance resulting in 15-22Mil annual economic value\n\n\\- Heating and cooling plants see 2-3% saving in energy consumption costs with $3mil annual economic value\n\n\\- Application in analyze energy for metered facility on the Ohio State university campus and is expected to see 25% energy saving within 10 years within 16 weeks of deployment \n\n\\- Application to analyze and forecast consumption for electricity and gas retail customers in France of 2.6Mil electricity consumers and 8.6mil has consumers with deployment of 6 months \n\n**Revenue model**\n\n\\- **Term subscriptions of the C3.AI Suite**\n\n\\- **Term subscriptions of C3.AI applications**\n\n\\- **Monthly runtime fee of C3 AI Applications and customer-developed application built using the C3.AI suite, usage based upon CPU- hour consumption**\n\n\\- **Professional services fees associated with training and assisting customers**\n\nIn the case of Engie, C3.AI would be making money from subscriptions to C3.AI suite and applications, setting up required trackers for measurements, developing AI applications, a monthly runtime fee if Engie is continuing to develop new applications with C3.AI. With the proven applications and set up, C3.AI then would be able to sell them to other companies that could also benefit from same implementation. **With Biden focusing on green energy infrastructures, one could expect the demand of the applications to increase.**\n\nTheir AI has also been used in sectors like utilities, banking, aerospace & defense, healthcare, retail, telecommunications, smart cities, and transportation. **With already proven and prebuilt applications listed below that could be implemented into broader and more general sector.** \n\n\\- **Anti-money laundering**\n\n\\- **COVID-19 Data lake**\n\n\\- **AI CRM**\n\n\\- **Energy management**\n\n\\- **Fraud detection**\n\n\\- **Inventory optimization**\n\n\\- **Predictive maintenance**\n\n\\- **Production schedule optimization**\n\n\\- **Readiness**\n\n\\- **Sensor health**\n\n\\- **Supply network risk** \n\n**As C3.Ai continues to work with various more different sectors to create more applications, C3.AI will be able to reach into more boarder market. With already established applications in various broad sectors, C3.AI is going to take AI to the next level by focusing on deep penetration into business solutions, aerospace and defense with the partnership with Microsoft, Adobe and Raytheon Technologies to fully dominate the sectors.** \n\n **TLDR:** \n\n**There is none cause im too lazy to type one.**", "id": "k9wieh", "created_utc": 1607535765.0, "score": 77, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 85, "comments": [{"body": "Last week it was supposed to be about $34 at IPO, fucking thing started and soared up to $100.\n\nJesus fucking christ.
