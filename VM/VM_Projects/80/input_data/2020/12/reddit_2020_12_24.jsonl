The March calls allow enough time for a serious catalyst to run up the price. \n\n- Also. EARNINGS BABY!!!! PLTR will report earnings on March 15 and we all know the pump that will result from this. This is close to expiration but the run up to earnings will pump up the value of the option, and the plan is to sell before Theta and IV fuck you. \n\n- Finally, the sentiment around PLTR is amazing.
