Possibly. With battery capacity eaten up by the more profitable use in cars and trucks. Basically, there may not be large scale, citywide battery capacity to accommodate fluctuations in a wind and solar dominated mix.\n4.\t⁠Grid owners will recognize the dilemma and turn to gas and nuclear, specifically small nuclear, in the form of Nuscale (owned by Fluor Corp $FLR). Fluor is Texas based (Republican support) and Nuscale provides a lot of good jobs, ideal for compromise green deals.\n5.\t⁠Additionally, the Northeast population corridor will require more nuclear as solar is meh there. I assume offshore wind alone can’t power the now-added needs of DC to Boston corridor\n6.\t⁠Nuscale modular, pre-fabricated and shipped in reactors will provide price stability, which will erase the anxiety over massive overruns. Plus, the small reactor design is far safer (and earthquake proof). At 4.2 bucks a watt, always-running, we may see a growing demand for nuclear.\n7.\t⁠Fluor is engineering and construction firm that will benefit from an infrastructure plan, for a company with 8 billion in annual revenue (give or take), and Utah’s first Nuscale reactor costing 1.5 billion, it is easy to see how there may be an opportunity here.\n\n** Central to the thought process is the assumption that electrical demands will go way up, but that we will be battery constrained which will inhibit solar and wind from becoming MAJORITY dominant in the energy mix due to the instability and inconsistency**", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Strongly agree with you on 1 & 2, but I diverge slightly at 3 and more at 4.\n\nBasically there are lots of way to manage variable power generation. One that you mentioned is adding gas. Others are:\n\n* Non-Li-ion batteries (e.g. flow, zinc-air, other emerging techs that are poor fits for EVs but may be suitable for grid storage)\n\n* Other energy storage (pumped hydro, CAES, LAES, eavor loops, and a variety of techs that are less likely to be successful like Siemens hot rocks and the assortment of rediculous perennial mass-inertia or mass-gravity schemes like flywheels and concrete blocks)\n\n* Non-variable renewable generation. (e.g. geothermal)\n\n* Variable renewable energy that is so cheap to build that its viable to overbuild it and curtail it in times of oversupply - we have already reached this for solar PV in a few places\n\n* The major elephant in the room that is massively underestimated is smart demand response - e.g. water heaters, HVAC, industrial heat, etc that can be intelligently controlled to match grid output. This has as much potential as all of the above techs combined, but very few \"get it\". Fortunately Elon does, hence his interest in residential home HVAC that can integrate into Tesla VPP solutions.\n\n\n\nThe part where I really diverge from your thesis is the logical leap that small nuclear will be the solution. Don't get me wrong, as an engineer I love nuclear and the protential it holds, but it is a very high risk business with a massive amount of regulatory uncertainty, severe headwinds from public opinion, and a long track record of projects going massively over budget (like 10x) before being cancelled as failures.

I think we *are* going to be battery constrained.\n\n2. I don't think that will be the case. It may be that other storage options are more expensive than lithium ion especially\nfor short duration storage, but that doesn't mean that they will be more expensive than nukes.
