I'm having a hard time figuring where your understanding has gone off because it's so wrong. Instead of making fun of you (like others have done) I will attempt to explain how the concept of debt/interest affect the balance sheet and income statement so that hopefully you can build your knowledge and maybe someone else will read this.\n\nFirst we need to understand the difference between a balance sheet and an income statement.\n\nA balance sheet effectively shows a company's assets, liabilities and equity *at a moment in time*. Assets are property that the company owns and liabilities are obligations that the company must pay to someone else. Equity is the difference and, at a high level, can be thought of as accumulation of money invested into the company and it's net profits (or losses).\n\nThe income statement shows a company's revenues and expense *over a period of time*. The net of the revenues and expenses is the company's \"net income\" for the period which then flows into the equity section of the balance sheet.\n\nNext let's talk about how debt and equity are treated on these statements.\n\nWhen Tesla takes out debt, they receive cash for that debt. At that moment this is purely a \"balance sheet transaction\" meaning that their liabilities (debt) increased by some amount but so did their assets (cash). This is important to understand. The income statement is not affected at the moment that debt is taken out. The company will then spend that cash on some assets (factories, FSD chips, whatever), that's another \"balance sheet transaction\" in that cash decreases and some asset increases. Let's forget about that for now. After some period of time, say a year, interest will accrue on the debt. This is the cost of borrowing money and this interest hits the income statement at the time that it is accrued. When the company pays this interest, they will hit cash (balance sheet) and interest expense (income statement). This can go on for many periods, it depends on the loan terms. When it comes time to pay back the principal, the company will decrease their cash position and decrease their liabilities. Again, this is a \"balance sheet transaction\" in that the repayment of the principal does not affect the income statement. *Principal repayments are not an expense of the company*.\n\nIn sum, interest payments hit the income statement while principal payments do not. This is a very important concept to understand when looking at financials because you can massively overstate or understand income statement impacts from debt issuances or repayments if you misunderstand the concept. If a loan carries a 10% interest rate and then repays the full amount of the loan you might overstate the impact on the income statement by 10 times if you look at it incorrectly.\n\nAs a bonus, let me give you a framework on how to think about debt and whether it is a good idea for a company to take on debt or repay their existing debt. Basically any time that a company thinks it can earn more money from investing the loan proceeds than it pays in interest, it should borrow money and/or not repay a loan. So if the loan is at 10% but Tesla thinks it can generate a 25% IRR from investing in a new battery plant, then it would be silly for Tesla to repay the loan. Unless of course Elon is trying to pander to a bunch of Wall Street dummies.\n\nFor some additional reading you can read about a concept called the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC).\n\nLet me know if any of that doesn't make sense or if you want any more explanations.

There’s no denying that the profits on straight long options cannot be rivaled by most other strategies including and especially limited-profit theta strats.\n\nYou are correct though that buying way otm yolo options and crossing your fingers won’t usually make you money, that’s why those are the exact options most option sellers love to _sell_. Money with long options is generally made buying at/in the money with longer term options (a few months out at least, if not LEAPS), letting the stock run some so they become even deeper itm and get some serious delta/gamma gains, and then selling at your profit target. And not coincidentally, these are the exact options that most option sellers _avoid_ selling, because there’s a high probability they’ll go against them as the contract seller.\n\nCase in point looking at MSFT, the Jan 2023 at the money ($220 strike) calls are currently approx $40. These calls have a breakeven price at expiration of about $260 and they have an entire two years. Is it relatively safe to say that MSFT will end up going well above $260 within the next two years? I think so, barring any sort of outlier event with the company or market, the possibility of which is of course always there.\n\nAnd, more often than not, one can sell these longer term options way before expiration for sweet profits, often in triple digit %, and I have personally done and continue to do many such trades. However, if one of these long options goes in loss, then that can also be big, which is why we need to give them extra time to ride out any shorter term dramas in the market, and also have a loss management plan.

They’re quiet, keep a low profile, and enjoy their gains. They don’t need to show it off to anyone on the Internet.\n\nYou are correct though that most fail at it. But I don’t believe that in itself makes any strategy outright ‘dumb’. It just means it’s way more complex than the average person can figure out or handle (with poor risk management of course almost always being the main culprit), which is why they tried, gave up, and moved on.\n\nMany day traders will argue that swing trading is dumb because your trading capital is at risk overnight and for many days/weeks at a time and subject to random events which occur during non-market hours which can potentially cause significant loss in a swing trade by the time the market opens next time around.
