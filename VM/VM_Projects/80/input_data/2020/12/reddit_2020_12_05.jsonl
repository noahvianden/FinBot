Firstly people think it's a \"data\" mining/gathering company which is far from true. For government contracts, palantir does not store any client data or have access to it. Their software only displays this data, where the data is kept on premise for a client (completely separate from palantir).\n\nGoogle and Microsoft are also players in government contracts, and they do get quite a few. But palantir is a company which has been operating for almost two decades now, and their artificial intelligence has solved a lot of complex problems so far. Google and Microsoft (and other AI-driven companies) could very well compete, but it would take them a long time to monopolise the market that palantir sits in at the moment.\n\nEdit: for anyone looking to learn more about Palantir, check out their medium posts starting with this one - https://medium.com/palantir/palantir-is-not-a-data-company-palantir-explained-1-a6fcf8b3e4cb", "score": 87, "replies": [{"body": "I watched an investor video and like you said, they make it clear they are not a data mining company.

From my experience with AWS, they are very reluctant to provide customized services, they want everything to generalize so that a developer could sit down and implement whatever they want without bugging them. They won't go after customer's needs. Palantir on the opposite provides customized solutions. When you use Palantir, you pay both AWS fees and Palantir fees so it is good for the AWS if Palantir acquires more customers and at the same time, AWS don't need to do customized solutions so they are actually promoting Palantir, rather than competing.
