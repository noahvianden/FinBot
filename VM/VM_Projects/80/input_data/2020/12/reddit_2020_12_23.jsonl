{"title": "Why it's not too late (still early) to invest in Magnite (MGNI) - CTV/PTV play", "selftext": "MGNI holder since $10 here. Also holding 800 call option contracts (positions at the end of post). It has been one of my top performers and is still in BEAST MODE. Some of you may have seen Needham analyst Laura Martin (same analyst who called FUBO early) mention on CNBC today that it is her top stock pick for 2021 and could run up 500% when asked by the hosts (I think that's a stretch). Her pick caused MGNI to run up another 17% after hours.\n\nIT IS STILL NOT TOO LATE TO GET IN. In fact, you are early. This is going to keep running, here is why:\n\nWe are just starting to see advertisers open up their budgets for Programmatic Advertising more and more. You've heard of cord cutting, right? You know you don't watch shit cable TV or at least don't want to anymore, right? Well, your favorite apps or shows on Connected TV (AppleTV, FireTV, Hulu, Netflix etc etc) are just beginning to work in advertising spots on their free programming. Magnite is the one who sells alot of those ads for massive clients (exclusive agency for Disney Hulu and Discovery Networks) and they will absolutely add more partners. This is just the beginning. I would say we are 30% of the way into adoption from big brand advertisers (they can also serve small-mid brands).\n\nIn addition, the technology they have processes super targeted ads in real time. This is much better for advertisers than what they got on linear TV. These advertisers have to follow the audience. They have no choice but to spend their money on CTV ads and the younger generations are ditching the cable box completely. This is like investing into the ad agencies that got huge at the inception of the television. BIG MONEY. Lots of room to grow.\n\nMagnite is also working closely with TTD (TradeDesk) to develop identity technology (think cookies) that is less intrusive to the user/consumer and more telling to the advertiser allowing them to target better and with less violation to the consumer's identity. SERIOUS tech. TTD is buying the ads for the big brand advertisers from MGNI who represents the sellers (Disney Hulu etc).\n\nTTD has a $50B market cap. MGNI is sitting right around a $3B cap right now. You see where I am going here. This company will grow and probably quickly since they are leading the sell side (SSP) of the Programmatic TV industry right now. Happy to answer more for any of you who have questions.\n\nHere is a great thread on Twitter that breaks down CTV/PTV, TTD and MGNI among others:\n\n[CTV/PTV Breakdown by  Dhaval Kotecha](https://twitter.com/dhaval_kotecha/status/1331454357452296192)\n\nWatch:\n\n[Needham's Laura Martin discussing Fubo, connected TV and calling MGNI her top pick for 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MldSPQyYzk&feature=emb_logo)\n\nPositions: 1/15/21 $25C, 3/19/21 $30C and $200k in current value equity.", "id": "kim7ej", "created_utc": 1608698160.0, "score": 83, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 84, "comments": [{"body": "Been in since it was at $18 did no DD but a reddit post and I'm glad I got in.", "score": 43, "replies": [{"body": "I bet you love watching that chart as much as I do on the daily.", "score": 17, "replies": [{"body": "It triggers seizures for me", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "It triggers euphoria for me", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "Y‚Äôall down for cocaine and hookers tomorrow?
