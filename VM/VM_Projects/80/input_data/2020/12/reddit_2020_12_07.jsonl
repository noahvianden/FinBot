{"title": "Researching historic SP movement around S&P500 inclusion events", "selftext": "**WARNING to those thinking about swing trading on inclusion day (sell then buy back in). Not as potentially easy as first glance would suggest.**\n\nUp front, I am big fan of Tesla and the TIC community, am a novice investor and welcome any feedback or comments. Also that the upcoming inclusion is *unprecedented* so who knows what will happen. I don't intend to spread any FUD but want to share some insights I've uncovered. What they mean is open to discussion and of course this is not investment advice. Being transparent, I intend to sell a portion of my shares for an upcoming house deposit. The better this performs, the more shares I can keep long term but if SP falls dramatically, I can still cover my short term financial needs.\n\n\\------------------------------------------------\n\nHave seen a lot of people posting here the 'guaranteed win' solution of swing trading TSLA around inclusion -- expecting a big spike, then big dump so one can 'time the market' and get some free shares or profits. Whilst this sounds logical and great, if I've learnt anything this year -- if everyone expects zig, then you'll likely get zag!\n\nTook the liberty to pull up historic SP movement around S&P500 inclusion dates for select number of interesting companies. This includes Yahoo, BRK-B, Facebook, Amazon, Google, Twitter, PayPal and Salesforce. It was hard to get clarity on exact dates of announcement and inclusion so have based this around peak volume day (day before inclusion as funds get to equal weighting).  I only compared -3 trading days before inclusion to 5 trading days after as this seemed to be where most of the action resided. \n\n*Image attached shows the SP movement (daily closing price) in comparison to inclusion date (100%).*\n\nIF the above swing trade method were to work, you would see a clear upwards movement on the left side of day 0 (inclusion date) then down on the right side. This DOES NOT SEEM TO BE THE CASE THE MAJORITY OF THE TIME. The red line is the average.\n\nMy personal assessment of this is that as the index/benchmark funds buying pressure begins, then we see the short term speculators exit along with those with low conviction/lower price targets, attempting swing trading or have short term financial needs i.e. house deposit. After this buying pressure is complete, then we are left with the high conviction shareholders IF the buying outweighs the sellers.\n\nThis upcoming inclusion is unprecedented to the extreme. There is over $100B of buying pressure expected to start in the few days before inclusion. This is A LOT of money. Combine this with huge media attention, current market and strong opinions combined with high options volume -- who knows what will happen next.\n\nSo take this for what it's worth. If you do intend to swing trade, don't forget taxes and that your long term capital gains timer will reset. Good luck trying to 'catch the falling knife'. If you're long term, the going consensus seems to bejust ride through it as ultimately this will have zero impact on the SP.\n\nFeel free to contribute to the discussion below and stay smart with your trading and investing. Good luck.\n\n\\------------------------------------------------\n\nAdditional interesting info\n\nDay of SHORT TERM highest closing price around inclusion (3 days before to 5 days after)\n\n* Amazon  5\n* Facebook  1\n* Yahoo  2\n* BRK-B  5\n* Google 5\n* Twitter 5\n* PayPal 1\n* Salesforce  5\n* AVERAGE 3.625\n\nMax daily volume % compared to average volume of data collected around inclusion\n\n* Amazon  661%\n* Facebook  325%\n* Yahoo  489%\n* BRK-B  1220%\n* Google 316%\n* Twitter 359%\n* PayPal 292%\n* Salesforce  572%\n* AVERAGE 529%\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0z9d6rzeop361.png?width=1427&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e15acdd05e8c75fd29bea67c6bee44062d7d9c7", "id": "k8bvrj", "created_utc": 1607325008.0, "score": 112, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 83, "comments": [{"body": "OP (and others), you may find the last couple mins of this video interesting.

It will allow my mind to rest a bit.\n\nJust as diversification is good when there is uncertainty with picking stocks, it can be good when trying to time the market. I think most people wanting to sell some (including myself) are debating wether to sell on the 18th, the 21st, or some weeks later when things stabilize.

So investing in Tesla does carry a risk greater than a diversified placement, especially if the company is valued way into far future earnings and something were to happen to Elon. And as correct Elon has been for a long time there's always the small risk he will do something crazy that doesn't work out. It's clearly a different breed of human that can say \"yeah I put every cent I had in the company with 90% risk of going bankrupt\". We need to keep this in mind and not get too tunnel-visioned by the success.\n\nAnother reason for my diversification is that my portfolio is not 100% \"don't touch for 10 years\".

Not saying this is the case here but a lot of people fervently believed in Enron and look what happened.\n\nAdditionally if you have a shorter term goal, you’re less exposed to volitility risk. Ie what if you were going to buy a house or retire next year? And then there’s a new 2008 housing crash (macro tank), stocks dump post inclusion and Elon for some reason says he’s sorry but doesn’t think FSD will ever be possible?

{"title": "ATSG - a sneaky play on AMZN", "selftext": "ATSG - Air Transport Supply Group.  An under the radar play on Amazon and likely an acquisition target. Stick with me here:\n\nATSG subsidiary Air Transport International will fly the six Boeing 767 converted freighters under a preexisting contract with Amazon to provide crew, maintenance and insurance. Amazon is leasing the planes for 10 years from another ATSG company, Cargo Aircraft Management (CAM), part of a deal this summer for 12 aircraft. \n\nThe first leased freighter began operating under the Amazon banner in May, with the remainder scheduled to start work next year.\n\nWith the new flight award, ATSG projects that its airlines will operate 38 767s for Amazon Air by April 2021, 36 of which CAM leases to Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN).\n\nIn exchange for the commitment for 12 more leases, Amazon will receive 7 million warrants to purchase ATSG stock, increasing its potential ownership stake to 38%. If Amazon leases five more aircraft under the 2018 deal, its equity stake in ATSG could reach 40% — double the investment rights granted in the initial 2016 partnership. So far, Amazon has not exercised any of the warrants granted by Wilmington, Ohio-based ATSG.\n\nI believe this is a strategic acquisition target for AMZN, as they have made a strong push into their own delivery and owning the process end to end. From delivery to the distribution centers to delivery to the customer. \n\nhttps://cheddar.com/media/amazon-replacing-usps-with-own-delivery-network\n\nBased on their growth with ATSG and their potential 40% ownership stake - it is a logical progression and one I’m betting on.\n\nATSG is a leading provider of aircraft leasing and air cargo transportation and related services to domestic and foreign air carriers and other companies that outsource their air cargo lift requirements. ATSG, through its leasing and airline subsidiaries, is the world's largest owner and operator of converted Boeing 767 freighter aircraft. Through its principal subsidiaries, including three airlines with separate and distinct U.S. FAA Part 121 Air Carrier certificates, ATSG provides aircraft leasing, air cargo lift, passenger ACMI and charter services, aircraft maintenance services and airport ground services.
