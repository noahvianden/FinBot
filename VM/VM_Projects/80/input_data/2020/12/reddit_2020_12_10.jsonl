This is the time where, if you sell, people in the future will wonder after you leave the room \"he got rich selling WHAT for WHAT valuation?\"\n\nLet's get into the technicals:\n\nMuch has been written, mostly wrong.   Tesla is the product of (i) massive leveraged bets, many by retail, (ii) gamma squeeze (the SIGs and other market makers of the world had never seen gamma move so quickly on newsless days and weren't ready for it to some extent) and (iii) up until $1,500 pre split, a massive short interest.  It was a perfect storm.\n\nNow, boatloads of the shares are in the hands of leveraged retail.  But it's not any leveraged retail.It's options, where the buyer has to affirmatively keep buying to keep the leverage on.  (to use my SIG example before, I believe they own 7% of the company's shares, all as Delta hedges to massively in-the-money options).\n\nThe leveraged buyers are no longer rolling forward their options if you look at the interest week over week.  Every week the long interest deep in the money and near the money is going down.  The leveraged buyers (again mostly retail) certainly aren't buying the shares held by the market makers.  They'll be dumped on the market over the next few months.\n\nThe S&P inclusion is important, but I've now read all of the S&P inclusion studies finding a short 5-10% bump.  It's based on arbitrage (buy at the announcement, sell when the funds buy).  In short, it's already happened.  None of the studies found a bump on the actual inclusion date.
