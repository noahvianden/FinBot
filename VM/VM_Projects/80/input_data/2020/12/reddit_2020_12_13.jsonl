{"title": "CNBC: ‚Äú I think this one could triple‚Äù. $BFT", "selftext": "You may have noticed an unexpected 10% spike on BFT after hours Friday (after it ran as high as 8% higher during regular trading). This spike came from no other than our boy Steve Grasso from Fast Money on CNBC. Steve said, ‚ÄúI like to give you stocks that could double. I think this one could triple.‚Äù \n\nNow.. if I had your curiosity and now have your attention, feel free to keep reading below. \n\nBFT is a SPAC. If you‚Äôve been living in a cave and didn‚Äôt have internet access to waste your life on WSB, a SPAC is a company created for the sole purpose of taking another company public. It‚Äôs a newer technique that has proven to be a much quicker way to get your company a ticker. \n\nThe company that will be getting a shinny new ticker is Paysafe. Paysafe is a multinational online payment system. Founded in 1996 and headquartered in London. Their largest marketshare is in Europe and are highly dominate in the gambling industry.  \n\nPaysafe\n\nFinancials: $1.5 billion in revenue. $468 mil EBITDA profit. Net profit of $142 million. \n\nCustomers: Paysafe is attached to very big names, in lots of sectors. Just a few are: Draftkings, Twitch, YouTube, Fortnite, Henri, Spotify, Staida, NH lottery. \n\nKey facts to note:\n\n1. Process over $100 billion per year. \n2. Jacked to the tits on diversification. From a large global presence, to a huge foothold in several key sectors. This has helped them a ton during Corona when so many others have faltered, they have remained steady.  \n3. Actually profitable, which is very rare for SPACS. \n4. Its major competitors (i.e. PayPal, Square, Venmo etc.) aren‚Äôt willing to move into gambling where Paysafe is dominating.  \n\nI don‚Äôt want to hear any, ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you tell me 18 years ago when the stock was a penny. The price went up so it can never go up again‚Äù. This baby was just confirmed last week and is just starting to make it on major news networks. You will start to see more than just CNBC talking about it as it‚Äôs one of the largest SPACS of the year, and I would challenge any of them to not recommend it as a buy.

Hyllion and all the other structured items that murdered investors but made the acquisition company plenty of money because of how they are built are just common and par for the course.

The company is basically sold to the public so if it tanks to the deepest areas in the Mariana Trench he made his money. Basically Hyllion is common, not rare, for SPAC performance and the winners are few and the structures are obscured and the bet is not ... clairvoyant. \n\nI actually have nothing against SPACs but it is worth noting that the companies that many of these are merging with are just either shady or stupid.
