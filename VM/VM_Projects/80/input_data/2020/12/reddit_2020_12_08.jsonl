There are two types. Calls and puts. \n\nCall options govern someone’s right to purchase the stock. Let’s say I buy a call option with a strike price of $15 on some stock $XYZ which is currently trading at $12 with an expiry of Feb 19, 2021. I give someone money (the option’s price or *premium*) for the right to purchase 100 shares of $XYZ from them for $1500 before or on Feb 19. I don’t own the shares but I have something that will change in value as the share price does (a *derivative*) if the share price rockets next week to $14.50 I’ll own a contract which is worth a lot more than I paid for it because of the chance it will end up “in the money” ie at a point where $XYZ is worth more than $15 a share (let’s say $17) and I can make a guaranteed buck by *exercising* my call and buying the stock for $1500 and immediately selling for $1700. Naturally if the stock price fails to reach $15 by the expiry date my contract becomes literally worthless, a risk which is not really present for stocks in general; at the same time the person on the other end faces incredible risk because the stock price can increase to $60 a share and they’re on the hook for my $5500 (minus the premium I paid for the call) profit; this is particularly bad if he did not own the stock outright (was naked, as opposed to covered if he owned it and could just begrudgingly hand over his stock that went to the moon). In this example I bought the call or was long on the call and the other guy was short on the call or sold the call. ELI5 call goes up when stock goes up. Long/buy call = bet stock goes up; short/sell call = bet stock goes down or stays sideways. \n\nA put is the exact opposite so you can buy a put which secures the right to *sell* someone shares. So in the previous example pretend $XYZ is trading at $17 and we buy a put option with $15 strike on it. We are now hoping that the stock price goes BELOW $15 before expiry. Let’s say it goes to $13. I go ahead and purchase 100 shares on the market for $1300 and then exercise my put option and sell them to the poor guy on the other side for $1500–> $200 profit (minus the premium I paid for the put originally). ELI5: stock goes down put goes up. Long/buy put = bet stock goes down; short/sell put = bet stock doesn’t go down.\n\nSome general things to know:\n\n1. Options lose value everyday because everyday there’s less opportunity for price movement. \n\n1a. The conclusion of this is your option could well be worth $0.00 on expiry day\n\n2. Options are weird and move based on more than just stock go up call go up like I’ve explained here. \n\n3. Even over their worst years most companies you’ve heard of won’t have their stock go to $0. \n\n4. Options are leveraged meaning that their value moves as a multiple of the share price changes. If you’re wrong you are very wrong and you only have so many days to wait out being right. It isn’t enough to be right about the direction your homework has a due date. \n\n5. Some but not all options plays can open you up to infinite risk like the fellow who sold me the call if he didn’t actually own the shares. It’s gonna be a rough day for him if he wakes up and sees that the stock price went to $200 and I can buy his shares for $15 pop. \n\n6.
