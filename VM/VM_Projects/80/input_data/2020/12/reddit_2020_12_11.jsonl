This is a comedy/entertainment piece and do not treat it like anything else... Don't act on anything written in this post. Read it like a retard.\n\nHello Retard!! \n\nHave you heard of the fallen Berry in the Fruit wars of the touch phones? \n\nNO?? Good I didn't expect you to know anything you retarded fuck!! and don't research it too or I'll call your wife's boyfriend to beat your ass!\n\nAnyway... BlackBerry has reinvented itself as an IT company in 2014 after John Chen became CEO. It now leads in the cybersecurity industry with contracts signed with 18 out of the 20 G20 countries. From the Airforce to Fortune 500 companies Blackberry handles their cybersecurity needs.\n\nI can go on and on about how good they are in the cybersecurity space but WE DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT SHIT! What we care about is the EV(EV stands for electrical vehicle you retard) industry which **WE** Blasted into Saturn this year.\n\nThe BlackBerry QNX software is in 175 million vehicles. In addition, BlackBerry just announced that it partnered with **Amazon** to create BlackBerry IVY which is a software which will allow automakers to provide a consistent and secure way to read vehicle sensor data, normalize it, and create actionable insights  from that data that will allow automakers to create personalized driver and passenger experiences and improve operations of connected vehicles. **Blah Blah Blah,** why would I care? Because every car company and especially EV companies were looking for a service like this which BlackBerry and Amazon **will literally pioneer.** In addition, the CEO mentioned in an interview the possibility of partnering up with our EV company **$TSLA.** Now imagine how news of this would affect $BB.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow your small brain might wonder with all of BlackBerry's potential, why isn't it moving much in price???!!! \n\nIn my opinion, It's because boomers are still butt hurt about the steep price drop of it after the fruit wars and that it never recovered. This company literally has a price to book value of 2.3. Which means it's very undervalued!! and it has **CASH** for days... so no worries about offerings.\n\n\nIf retards on WSB adopt this $BB and raise it, it might become the next bloated EV play in the industry. \n\n**TLDR;(I'm all in $BB)**\n\nMy positions: 1333 stocks, 100 19 MAR 21 12$ calls\n\n\n**Update:** I‚Äôve just bought 667 more stocks on margin for 8.02$ to raise my position to 2000 stocks.\n\n**Update 2:** Motley Fool Canada wrote an article 5 hours ago with very similar wording to this post.

{"title": "Your Tendie Stimulus IV: Don‚Äôt Buy the Dip (yet), Jerome has forsaken us", "selftext": "EDIT: this is **not** meant to be super bearish‚Äî I actually think SPY probably has a green Monday. I‚Äôm saying targeted stock choices should be made based on/ once stimulus comes through, and in accordance with Wednesday FOMC decisions, rather than SPY calls at the moment. \n\n[UPDATE: interesting article from October talking about limited Fed maneuvers left](As DC delays stimulus, the Fed is running out of ways to help economy https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/28/the-fed-.html?__source=iosappshare%7Ccom.apple.UIKit.activity.CopyToPasteboard)\n\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-\n\n**Yes, its true**.  The liquidity programs we've come to know and love--the true \"pumps\"‚Äîare stagnating or contracting, and it's clear SPY doesn't like this.  We are our own out there people. Let me break down for you how and why that is; and what we can do to save our tendies.\n\n*First, let‚Äôs take a quick look at the vehicles that the FED has used to keep us propped up that I‚Äôm referencing:*\n\n**Overnight short-term loans (Repo, Reverse Repo operations)**\n*What It Is*\n[More detailed description I did back in the day here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hcdpox/dd_playing_vxx_and_spy_against_the_fed_repo/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf), but this is the process by which the FED has been giving banks overnight loans so they could make asset purchases.  They used to give these loans to each other, but the process became fucked up and expensive and the FED stepped in to fix this by offering the loans themselves at a low rate.  Once the pandemic hit, they took the unprecedented step of offering the loans with zero additional interest for themselves, basically offering free money.\n[‚Äò0 basis points over IOER‚Äô is nerd speak for ‚Äòfucking free money‚Äô](https://i.imgur.com/tD780yn.jpg)\n**-Did it work?  Yes.**  \nFed Policy typically takes a couple of months to affect the market.  With that in mind, you can see that the performance of SPY correlates with the interest rate and bid volume on overnight repo operations.  Free money policy was instituted in March, and the impact gained full strength in the spring.\n[look at this insane Repo activity in early June when the loans were free money. SPY was +7% month to date!](https://i.imgur.com/3bwjqd5.jpg)\n\n**Treasuries** \nI won't go too deep into treasury purchases and its effect on market activity, but the simplified version is this; **if the FED needs to flood the market with money by pushing people to invest in vehicles aside from safe, boomer treasuries, they will buy up the treasuries themselves.**  This raises the price of treasuries by starving the market, thus giving them less yield--in other words, making them less valuable.  With less yield, people turn to stocks.  That's an oversimplified version of how it works, but you get the gist; the FED buys treasuries so people buy stonks.\n**-Did it work? Yes**.\nTake a look at the yield rate on treasuries here.  [At this time in 2019, the 20 year yield was up as high as 2.2%](https://i.imgur.com/1fLBbE3.jpg).  But, take a look at what happens after March.  The Fed begins buying up the treasuries, and the yield goes down to .98 in April.  All you need to know is that means the yield on treasuries was dogshit so people were pressured to buy stonks.\n\"How do you know this was the Fed's doing?\"\nThey said it.  [Here is one of many statements from the FED](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/opolicy/operating_policy_200312a) saying \"we are going to by the fuck out of treasuries at an increased rate because of COVID\".  How increased?  Take a look at this photo, we are talking about an average of 10 or 20 billion dollars, to 80 million dollars a clip.\n[treasury spending increased 3 fold](https://i.imgur.com/J08Av7D.jpg)\n\n**Bond Repurchases**\nIn March the FED announced they would be buying corporate bonds in another major boost to available liquidity.  Just as SPY got shaky, it was an added boost immeditely after the June  crash (a crash, btw, caused by a change in the repo loan interest rates).  Basically, when large companies need money they issue bonds to shore up cash that are available to the public (same shit as treasuries, basically)--the FED is now buying those bonds.  This direct infusion of cash from the FED is about as close to outright buying stock in companies as you can get.\n**Did it work? Yes**. \nSee: June rebound.  Also google some of the types of companies they're buying bonds from.  There's a reason why the fact that nobody is paying rent hasn't caused a mortgage-backed credit crisis for major banks...yet.\n\n*So, weve established the main tools the FED uses to prop up the market and that they work.  What‚Äôs the problem, and why am I saying JPOW has forsaken us?*\n\n**Because the Fed‚Äôs balance sheet has been contracting, and with that these programs are no longer offering nearly as favorable terms as they once were, but the market isn‚Äôt strong enough to handle those unfavorable terms.**\n\n[here‚Äôs a graph from the FED showing their flatlining balance sheet](https://i.imgur.com/CoRcfBb.jpg)\nThe FED is spending less overall than it was earlier this year (remember, it takes a couple months for spending policy to catch up in the market).  *This was bound to happen, but the problem is the key programs I mentioned are all at obviously ineffective levels and haven‚Äôt been increased.* PROBABLY BECAUSE NOBODY COUNTED ON THE SECOND COVID SURGE DESTROYING PROGRESS IN EMPLOYMENT NUMBERS. \n**a) Repo operations haven‚Äôt been the zero-cost interest level since July**, moving from +0 basis points over the standard interest rate, to +5--and on longer term loan operations +10.  The market has not responded kindly to losing their free money, looking at the monthly SPY charts.\n**b) While generous, the treasuries purchases have stalled out at 80 million**.  More importantly, the FED hasn't facilitated any key changes to which terms they purchase (long v short, etc). The market has responded to this stagnation with stagnation, looking at the monthly SPY charts.\n**c) Bond purchases not set to increase**: The FED is still purchasing bonds, but have also stagnated the rates of that along with the other two facilities.  Kaplan, the Dallas Fed Chair who's always running his mouth, has [indicated a lack of support for increased corporate bond purchases. ](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/02/kaplan-says-hes-not-in-favor-of-fed-increasing-bond-purchases.html)\n\n**What the contracting FED balance sheet, the stagnation of these increased liquidity programs, and the lackluster performance of SPY over the past three months combine to signal is that the market/SPY is NOT healthy enough on its own to continue its rise.  Sure there will be good days, I even have a 267 exiting Monday, but the absurd gravy train of June-August is no more. If you take the 5 day election bump out the picture, SPY has performed over 50% less than its aggregrate performance April-August.**\n\nWhy did I say don't buy the dip YET? Is help coming?  Yes.  Two potential ways:\n**1) The stimulus**: if enhanced UI benefits are improved, the spending in the consumer goods and credit market would provide a huge boost that could offset the economic effects of an increasingly bleek jobs situation.\n\n**2) The FOMC meeting on the 16th**: this is where the FED would make any decisive changes on the lending programs mentioned here.  My guy /u/curiousmaniac pointed out to me that these changes, if they even happened, likely wouldn't come to fruition in the new year (even if the policy is changed on the 16th).\n\n**So yeah, you might wanna chill on SPY. I hear you saying ‚Äúwhere was this BEFORE TODAY?! REVISIONIST HISTORY‚Äù**\n-[here's my DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k9zcbo/why_the_market_is_becoming_the_economy_a_tale_of/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) from  last week calling the top of SPY at 370\nTo be fair, I'm wrong a fucking ton, as we all are lol. but gotta flx those few sweet moments you get it right.\n\n**Positions:**\nTLT is my new hedge against SPY because VIX and its derivatives are ass rn.

(here's my[ DD on VIX 101 if you're curious](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jfhdta/volatility_for_dummies_vxx_uvxy_vxx_and_spy/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf))\nOther than that, monthly stimulus plays that favor consumer spending (on places that are at an advantage from hybrid online/retail models due to lockdown), TOL (housing numbers explode when stimmy passes), and TDOC because TDOC is dope. \n\n**WMT: 1/8 155c**\n**TGT: 1/8 180c**\n**TDOC 11/24 200c**\n**TDOC 1/15 205c**\n**AAPL: 1/8 126c**\n**HPQ: 1/15 25c**\n**TOL 1/15 46c**\n\n\n**TLDR**: FED tools are drying up, SPY is too dangerous for now--market isn't strong enough on its own yet.  Count on monthlies that are a hybrid of pandemic retail/online winners in preparation for the stimulus, and pay attention the results of FOMC meeting on the 16th.
