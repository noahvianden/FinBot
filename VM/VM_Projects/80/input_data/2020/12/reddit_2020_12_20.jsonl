I did a quick comparison of the Dot Com  Bubble vs the current \"Bubble\". In both instances we have a small bull  run, small correction (relatively speaking) and then a massive bull run.  In the 2000s I used 1500 as the baseline and 8000 as the current  baseline. The graph shows the Change in percent of the overall QQQ  Market leading up to the correction and into the subsequent market. They  are eerily similar. I would argue we are under performing the bull market of 1999 and have not reached the bull market of 2000. Based on  this, honestly, we may not see a huge correction until we hit Nasdaq 16K. It could even go to 24K?\n\nI feel good about the next 6 months. After that its a toss up.    Of course I am not an expert so this is just hypothesizing...will  history repeat itself?
