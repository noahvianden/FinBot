Okay that's a joke.\n\nBasically all new technologies do this and the world embraces a few and the rest go to zero. Now I am not saying NIO will do this within 2 years or anything but if you think about the curvature of competition [and the technological lifecycle](https://www.perecondom.com/2017/08/28/how-specific-technology-evolves-from-birth-to-death/) we're not in a place where we can actually declare with any wisdom winners and losers.\n\nI am not saying you are wrong. I am not saying you are dumb. I am only saying that your end-game PT and such might A) be really, really high and B) you might find that even if the company expands and is successful and such it might not be what it needs to be in order to survive and thrive and dominate in such a large, overcrowded marketplace (China) where you have very real archaic nepotism driving many business deals.\n\nFor all I know it is possible that NIO ends up acquired by another company if it is successful and simply consumed.
