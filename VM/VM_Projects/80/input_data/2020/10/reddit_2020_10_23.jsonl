{"title": "iPhone 12 launches in China to strong demand despite stiff competition for Apple in 5G smartphones", "selftext": "https://sg.news.yahoo.com/iphone-12-launches-china-strong-073637889.html\n\nCompared with last year’s iPhone 11 line of phones, the iPhone 12 line is showing strong demand in China. The country is estimated to account for 35 to 45 per cent of global demand for the iPhone 12 Pro, according to a recent report from TF Securities International analyst Kuo Ming-Chi, who is known for his Apple analysis. There were between 7 million and 9 million pre-orders of the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro globally during the first weekend of sales, according to Kuo.\n\nThe new iPhones have also proven to be a hot commodity on Chinese e-commerce sites. The available stock on JD.com sold out within 30 seconds after pre-orders started on October 16. And Alibaba, the parent company of the South China Morning Post, said that about 30 million users have searched for the new iPhones over the last 30 days on its Tmall marketplace. That is twice the search volume for the iPhone 11 in the same period last year.\n\nSales of the iPhone 12 could be aided by the fact that it is the first iPhone to support 5G after Apple skipped the feature last year. Sales of the iPhone 12 and 12 Pro reached an estimated 1.7 to 2 million units globally in the first 24 hours of pre-orders. The three iPhone 11 models only saw 500,000 to 800,000 units sold in the same period after pre-orders opened in September last year, according to the report from Kuo.\n\nThanks for the awards.", "id": "jgl2db", "created_utc": 1603451354.0, "score": 1053, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 82, "comments": [{"body": "That title gave me a stroke", "score": 220, "replies": [{"body": "Well good thing it didn’t make you stiff just like how apple is facing stiff competition in 5g smart phones as the iPhone 12 launches in China", "score": 76, "replies": [{"body": "As a holder of Apple stock, it’s making me stiff", "score": 42, "replies": [{"body": "Judging by your username are you related to Tim apple?", "score": 19, "replies": []}, {"body": "Are you?

I'd much rather have access to it from other computers and phone brands. I think the monopoly is its ecosystem. And the laptop business should break away from the phone unit.\n\nApple's quality in laptops has gone to shit. I can't even use my 15\" MacBook Pro, that I paid $3K for, as a portable because the keyboard doesn't work by design (it repeats characters and misses characters and yes it was \"fixed\" per the recall but it's a shitty design so it doesn't work again), and also my laptop started to swell up because the battery was exploding, which turns out to be also a problem by design that Apple was sued over in 2017 and continued to design the problem into its laptops despite that suit. Unfortunately, this $3K POS isn't the first badly design Mac laptop that I lost money on. I thought the first one was a mistake, and by now I realize that it's just a mega corporation that is churning out sleek, attractive crap and basically can afford to defy its customers to try to sue it over small amounts now that class action lawsuits are no longer allowed. Even if someone sues and wins, it doesn't bother the company. I had to eat the battery recall on my laptop because no one had sued Apple over the 2018 15\" Macbook pros yet. And that whole deal with paying companies to destroy usable used iPhones and trying to use IP rights to forbid individuals from repairing their products, is also greedy behavior of a company that has gotten too large to compete and has become predatory of its own customers, in order to keep up profits. I was so pissed off that I refused to pay Apple to repair my battery issue and I ripped apart my laptop and fixed it myself. And it has to serve as a desktop because I have to use a separate keyboard because the keyboard doesn't work reliably. \n\nAll of that has really opened my eyes to how greedy and unethical Apple has become. I only buy used MacBook pro laptops now, from other individuals, because I don't want to hand the company any more profits and also because a model has to be out for a year or two before all the design flaws are thoroughly tested by the public before I'll buy one. Same with the phones. I don't want to spend so much money on a phone that has a magically draining battery like my iPhone 6 had. So I'll just buy an iPhone a year or two after the model is out and tested by the public. I'm trapped in the Apple Ecosystem for now, until I muster up the energy to move, but I think the company itself has been making overpriced crap since Steve Jobs died. \n\nApple was one kind of company when it was a computer company. It's another kind of company as a phone toy maker. I'm going to all linux laptops and a home cloud server as soon as I get the time.\n\nI believe it's gotten too greedy and influential to be a responsible organization. I definitely think it should be broken up into different business units or release its ecosystem for other equipment makers to design to. I am an Apple customer who thinks it should be broken up. I had the first iPhone model and have been an Apple customer ever since, and I've basically hated the company since 2018 after being repeatedly ripped off by a company that is leveraging its broad footprint to gouge its customers unethically. All of its recent exploitive issues are the kinds of things progress to when they are monopolies. \n\nThe reach and popularity of its phone products has enabled it to become a corrupt computer company that would not survive with its business practices if it had to compete as a standalone business unit.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Nothing you listed makes it a monopoly and the us gov has no power to break it up.

You know what’s even better? ITM spreads! You can get great R/R at the cost of lower POP. But the far lower risk makes up for it. My usual trade now is a max R/R of 1–1, usually positive reward to risk. Combining that with TA, risk management and diversification and I have a decent edge. I’ve been generating about 5% returns per week while staying 75% cash and keeping position size small.\n\nThe TT strategy is for people who want/need a high win loss ratio, like you said you’ve only lost two trades. Losing trades is not a big deal for me, that being said my win/loss ratio is usually between 50-70%. I usually close my trades at 50-75% profit, never letting them go to expiration, similar to tasty trades but not leaving so much money on the table.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "But with the TT method, you never accept a max loss.
