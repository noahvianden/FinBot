{"title": "Conservative Option Trading", "selftext": "There are countless ways to trade options (I've probably tried them all over the years). I think that you first need to define for yourself an objective (beyond making money which we all have) and then evolve a strategy that fits.\n\nAt my retired age, I can't wait for long term stock trades so my objective is short term \"in and out\" option trades with a high annualized run rate (30%+....can't get that from a bank),\n\nMy strategy is short term trades with a high probability of success and using decaying time premium as the source of income.\n\nI use short strangles as my trading approach and for success probability I set the strikes at 2 standard deviations from the price for the time period….statistically, this indicates a 95% success rate. I also use mostly ETF’s although solid slower moving companies also work as they are less inclined to wide swings (don’t want that with a strangle). I also use weeklies as I only go out 3-4 weeks as time decay seems highest during this period. I have several more “rules” for myself for protection and to stay focused. It has taken me several years to evolve this approach, but it has been working pretty well for me.\n\nOnce I enter the trade, I then monitor the premiums frequently. If they decline to where the annualized run rate has increased to 100% or better of the original expectation, or the actual return is at least 50% of the original target, I close the trade….old adage on the street is to not be a pig and don’t be greedy. This also frees up collateral for another trade.\n\nSo what’s the downside? First of all, since I am selling naked options, the collateral requirements are quite high which governs the rate of return.....my account has grown to the point where I can have a number of trades open at a time. However, one needs to check several brokerage firms to find the best (lowest) collateral requirements. As my trading account has been growing, the trades have become like compounding interest.\n\nA second drawback is the amount of effort needed to monitor the trades. Sometimes a trade will move to the 100% return range in a matter of days, so I close it to take the profits off the table to free up collateral for another trade. The reason the return rate increases is because the time decay has occurred over fewer days than originally planned (that's goodness).\n\nAnother issue is the amount of bookkeeping needed. Since the account has been growing, I’ve been having more trades open (another rule is to stay diversified) and I have to really pay attention to them just in case.\n\nSo being at my advanced age what do I do with the profits?....as the account has been growing, I transfer a portion of the gains to the brokerage accounts I've opened for the grandkids where I buy them solid long term issues like MSFT, AAPL, QQQ, etc.\n\nOption trading has become my hobby. My approach is not a get rich quick scheme, however given time and effort, you can certainly build a healthy nest egg.

{"title": "ICE OEM's Deadpool", "selftext": "I collected a list of major indicator at  31st December 2019, pre-COVID19, for 10 traditional ICE OEMs and asked myself if looking at this data and at what is happening in 2020 I can guess which one of them is going to fail first. My thesis is that the downturn trend for ICE OEMs, was already in place at the end of 2019 and COVID-19 simply accelerated the trend and forced different responses from different OEMs depending on the urgency they assessed their future.\n\nMy initial Deadpool places at number 1 is the the OEM with the most urgent need to apply correction in 2020 in order to survive; number 10 id the OEM that may have perceived less the need to adapt.\n\nSurprisingly, Ford come up as the company that, in my simplified analysis, had the worst Cash on Hand to Debt to Earning ratio, hence has the least margins to postpones changes and survive. With that in mind (and hindsight is always 20/20) it seems natural that they made a big deal to embrace BEV with the Mach E and the upcoming F150E. If they keep on changing fast they may turn the boat around, and they can because of the corporate command chain being still driven by a single family.\n\nThe second group of companies that should had felt some urgency is GM(#2), BMW(#3) and Nissan(#4) , closely followed by Hyundai(#5) and Daimler(#6). It seems that all these companies have kind of started exploring serious BEV transitions but at a somehow slower pace then Ford.\n\nThe next group is Vokswagen (#7) and Honda (#8) that have, in my humble opinion, very diverging strategies with VW trying to race ahead with BEV and Honda being kind of paralyzed or keeping their cards very close to their chest.\n\nThe last two are FCA+PSA (#9) and Toyota(#10) and both are basically dragging their feet because they started from a more \"comfortable\" position at the end of 2019.\n\nMy thesis hence,  is that the ability to survive will boil down to speed of adaptation and the amount of \"cash-reserve/market credit\"  or resources available at the end of 2019.  Unfortunately for the ICE OEMs, the speed of change is not under their own control but is dictated by the like of Tesla that is only constrained by production capability.\n\nIf Tesla or another automaker can ramp up fast enough to cover the demand of BEVs, the speed of change required to keep up would quickly outrun the resources (cash on hand and market credit) and we will start see big trouble.\n\nSo who will be the first to collapse and possibly force governments into providing additional resources? My bet is equally spread over GM, BMW and Nissan, simply because I give Ford credit for trying hard to change fast (just my opinion).\n\nWhat do you think? how may I get better insight from the 2020 data?

They now have falling production everywhere while their operating expenses continue. C Class down 46%. E class down 32%, S class down 25%\n\nWhen they post real earnings, I'll have a dive into those.

They don't cut advertising, they pay even more for the super bowl ads.  Business as usual.\n\nThe high margin sales are not coming back.

At an industry meeting near Stuttgart, Blume said synthetic fuels would \"not be in competition with electric mobility\" but rather supplement the use of battery-powered cars, the news agency dpa [reports](https://www.wiwo.de/unternehmen/industrie/oliver-blume-porsche-chef-serientaugliche-efuels-in-zehn-jahren-moeglich/26273802.html) in an article carried by the business weekly WirtschaftsWoche. The CEO of luxury carmaker Porsche stressed that there already are \"billions of cars in the world's vehicle stock, which is why we have to approach the issue from both ends.\" This would mean in a forward-looking way through electric engines and in backward-looking way by allowing cars with combustion engines to become climate-friendly through synthetic fuels. [**E-mobility**](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_e#e-mobility) **alone could not achieve the transport sector's climate and sustainability targets, Blume said**. He added that technological progress would lower the costs for synthetic fuels from currently more than ten euros per litre to about two euros by 2030, which would allow for a mass roll-out of the technology. By contrast, Blume said fuel cells were no option for the carmaker, as the transport of pure hydrogen to service stations would be too much of a logistical challenge.\n\n**The oil industry and other industrial groups are** [**pinning high hopes on synthetic fuels**](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/oil-industry-lobbies-german-government-boost-synthetic-fuels-amid-corona-crisis) **as a way to keep combustion engines and the associated infrastructure running amid the push towards more sustainable mobility.** While many major carmakers as well as the German government regard battery-powered vehicles as the main technology needed to achieve comprehensive emissions reduction for passenger vehicles, synthetic fuels are seen as one option to also reduce the climate impact of freight vehicles, transport vessels or aeroplanes.\n\nFrom another article:\n\nPrices at electric car charging points in Germany are not transparent and diminish the trust people have in [e-mobility](https://www.cleanenergywire.org/glossary/letter_e#e-mobility), the consumer protection association vzbv has [said](https://www.vzbv.de/pressemitteilung/e-autos-intransparente-preise-ladesaeulen). **\"Customers often don't know what they will have to pay for a kilowatt hour and face drastically higher prices without any discernible reason.\"**\n\nWho owns the largest third party system Ionity?
