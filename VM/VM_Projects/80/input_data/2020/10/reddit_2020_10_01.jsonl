{"title": "COSTCO CALL option play since May", "selftext": "Edit: I'm not sure why I mistyped intrinsic value but if you know that is, then you know what I mean. I'm just trying to share a strategy that worked for me, not trying to brag or anything. Always stay humble.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI played COSTCO call options since May and made about $200k. COSTCO is a stock with low implied volatility and rewards you well if you are patient. This is not a swing trade or a 10 bagger but in my opinion, it was always a sure thing, hence I was able to buy 100 or 200 call options. I've played other tech options, NVDA, AMD, AMZN, TSLA but it always felt like pure gambling. I made about 40k on NVDA but got burned for 20k on TSLA and AMZN. I don't recommend playing options on tech stocks unless you're YOLOing stimulus money or a paycheck.\n\nOption trading on WSB has become exactly that but there are still handful savvy people that are playing smart. Sure, in the beginning when you have less than $10k, you can take higher risk for higher reward. But when you accumulate over 50k or 100k, you can invest on plays like this that gives you 10-15% return consistently without having to risk losing 80%.\n\nMy advice is once you hit 50k, don't chase option plays like ZOOM or obscure meme plays like PRPL. Play monthly options on low premium on call options like WMT or TGT. Don't hold for earnings unless you have options that are over 1 month till expiration.\n\nIf you manage to get past 100k, then put 75k in APPL or AMZN or NVDA and you can do whatever you want with the 25k. This has worked for me and hopefully this inspires this community to play smarter and make money.\n\nNow I will go to local Costco and get some rotisserie chicken.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fevp23hboiq51.png?width=1053&format=png&auto=webp&s=dcc0b91dfe2ccfcd8c5ee0ea0eefd0ab2d28a254\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kbst9qwgoiq51.png?width=972&format=png&auto=webp&s=0891a965f84b59a91b7341b519bf5588fbe61c7d\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xpj57o7loiq51.png?width=941&format=png&auto=webp&s=c49437265d557ea40dc8cbc7446a68df76a36c3e\n\nIt wasn't all glory and there were days when my unrealized loss was 30k or 40k but you have to set a price target or an exit date and be discipline.
