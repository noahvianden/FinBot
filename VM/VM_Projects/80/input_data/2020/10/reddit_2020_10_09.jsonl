It offloads network specific functions more efficiently than running them on the CPU.\n\nThe DPU, also handles virtualization functions, further increasing the efficiency of distributive model of Datacenters.  Datacenter MONIES is all about efficiency, AMD's Zen3 is already delivering Significantly higher Performance/watt vs the competitor. With in house DPU, that is further acceleration towards integrated/complete, easy to implement product lines.\n\nIn function , this deal is identical to the Mellanox + Nvidia deal.\n\nXilinx is very strong in the DPU space and they have one of the best products.\n\nXilinx also make FPGAs, flexible processors for development of custom products. They claim they are not an FPGA company, they're a solutions company, but really, they solution your problems using their FPGAs, hahaha.\n\nFPGAs are used as accelerators, specific AI functions or math can be done faster on FPGAs,  and they are flexible if you decide on a different function tomorrow, just update. These work differently vs CPUs, but they complement each other. Yes, AMD is in AI, and that role will increase along with the rest of the market.", "id": "j7zrrr", "created_utc": 1602253112.0, "score": 86, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 79, "comments": [{"body": "Then why tf is AMD down.
