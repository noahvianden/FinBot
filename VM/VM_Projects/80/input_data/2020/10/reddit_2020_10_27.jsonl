It is an instant dilution. Since you made the comment \"know or care what P/E means\" I'll assume you actually just don't know. Think about it this way. Company is worth $100 and there are 100 outstanding shares, then each share is worth 1% of the company. If tomorrow there are 101 shares then each share is now worth 0.99% of the company. It doesn't matter what the price is, they are now diluted. If the company were to sell tomorrow you would get 1% less. If they issued a dividend you would get 1% less. And if you voted you would be 1% less heard. \n\nThat is true value of the share. Supply and demand are actually the only things that don't get effected intrinsically. It's the markets responsibility to price in the change. Elon selling is the only directly impacts supply and demand.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "LOL my bad I thought I was in wallstreetbets.  But also, that's not totally correct.  Ill try my best to explain, sorry for the tone earlier, WSB has a twisted way of showing affection towards one another. \n\nThe share price and \"share holder dilution\" are two different things which historically have a strong correlation (so its generally acceptable to assume that when shares outstanding go UP, Stock price goes DOWN).  This is all based on the fundamentals of supply and demand.  If supply goes up, demand for that good goes down.  If a company sells stock on the market to create capital, it causes the price to drop because the supply of stock has gone up.  (This is what you are arguing and I agree that is true)\n\nHowever, this is a different situation.  Because while technically the shares outstanding are up the public float is unchanged.  Go [here](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/062315/what-difference-between-shares-outstanding-and-floating-stock.asp) for more info on shares outstanding and public float.  But here is a quote:   \n\n\"[Floating stock](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/floating-stock.asp)¬†is generally the most narrowed metric of analyzing a company‚Äôs stock by shares. The floating¬†stock is a measure that excludes closely-held shares. Closely-held shares are stock shares that are held by company insiders or controlling investors. These types of investors typically include officers, directors, and company foundations.\n\n**Many indexes use the floating stock of a company as the basis for market cap calculation**\"\n\nSo, since Elon acquiring new shares will unarguably be considered \"closely held\" the number of shares float is unchanged.  It even says that most indexes use shares float as the basis for market cap.  If you believe that the fundamentals of a market are based on supply and demand, it remains unchanged.  There is not the typical \"shareholder dilution\" that is typical with a company selling on the open market for capital.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "All good man.

Elon outright owns 20% of the company, if that much was unaccounted for it would be a massive swing in the market caps being reported. Not to mention a huge amount devoted to employee comps.
