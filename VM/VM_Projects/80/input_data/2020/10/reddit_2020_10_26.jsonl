Tesla will hopefully have its advantage because of cheapest batteries and vertical integration, so tesla can offer best price in robotaxi prices.

In the long run most of the saving should run down to the end customer in dramatically lower prices. I do think this is a massive opportunity of course, all im saying I feel like it might be sometimes over estimated in the sense that it is compared to current model and state of things instead.
