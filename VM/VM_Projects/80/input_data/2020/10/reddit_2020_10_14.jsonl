{"title": "Here is a Market Recap for today Wed, Oct 14, 2020. Please enjoy!", "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, October 14, 2020**\n\nStocks accelerated yesterday‚Äôs losses as market participants digested a new round of corporate earnings report and the prospects of additional stimulus before the November presidential election.\n\nThe Nasdaq finished 0.84% down. The S&P (SPY) fell 0.63%, and the Dow Jones finished the day 0.53% down.\n\nToday, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin admitted that coming to a deal regarding stimulus and advancing the measure through Congress would be ‚Äúdifficult‚Äù before the November election. The remarks come shortly after Mnuchin and House Speaker Pelosi met on the phone to negotiate further, a deal Pelosi‚Äôs spokesperson called ‚Äúproductive‚Äù. The two are set to discuss again tomorrow, but after multiple weeks of discussion and the November election coming ever-nearer, chances for additional stimulus look dim. \n\nThe impasse between US lawmakers over stimulus is alarming, given the frequent calls of Pres. Trump, Jerome Powell and other FOMC members, and economist for more virus-relief. Yesterday, Senate Leader Mitch McConnel said he would introduce a smaller, more targeted proposal to the Senate when the chamber reconvenes next Monday. He said ‚ÄúWhen the full Senate returns on October 19th, our first order of business will be voting again on targeted relief for American workers, including new funding for the PPP.‚Äù The estimated $500 billion deal is way below the $1.8 trillion package proposed by the White House earlier in the week, a sign that negotiations may be souring. However, Pelosi has made it clear she would not support smaller, targeted bills, calling them inadequate. Pres. Trump appears to agree with her, tweeting ‚ÄúGo big or go home!!!‚Äù for more stimulus. \n\nIn other news, two companies in the forefront of vaccine development for the coronavirus announced their respective trials were put on trial over safety concerns. Eli Lilly (LLY) said Tuesday afternoon that enrollment for its COVID-19 treatment would be temporarily halted, less than a day after Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) said clinical trials for its COVID-19 vaccine candidate were paused due to an unexplained illness in a participant. Shares of Eli Lilly and Johnson & Johnson were little changed overnight after dropping during Tuesday‚Äôs session.\n\nIn terms of earnings season, all eyes are on big banks as they have already started to report. An article published by Marketbeat summarized sentiment by stating that ‚ÄúJPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Wells Fargo and Bank of America saw their profits partly recover in the third quarter from the depths of the coronavirus-caused recession earlier this year. The turnaround stems mostly from improvements in the U.S. economy that allowed these big banks to set aside less money to cover potentially bad loans ‚Äî $5 billion in the third quarter versus $33 billion in the second quarter.‚Äù\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Goldman Sachs (GS) reported third-quarter results that greatly exceeded expectations.
