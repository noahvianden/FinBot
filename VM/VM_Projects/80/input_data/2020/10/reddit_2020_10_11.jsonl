{"title": "Sell before the US election?", "selftext": "I have around $50k in Fidelity index funds in my Roth IRA, and have gained about 20% across the board from my initial investments 3+ years ago. I have always been a cautious investor, and learned that going the index fund route for all investments is a safe bet, plus with low fees and expense ratios, it seemed like the most bang for buck. That said, the kangaroo stock market has me interested in throwing a bit of money at stocks to see what happens. I put in some money to AMD stock and already have a 25% return since initially investing a few months back. At 28 years old, I feel like I could be a bit more risky.  \nMy understanding is that with the ROTH IRA, any money I make in that account, I will not have to pay taxes or capital gains when withdrawing. Would there be any advantage to dumping funds now that the market is quite high, and waiting to see how rocky this election is? Then buying funds again when there is a dip? With the current political climate, I really can't see the election going smoothly, leading to people selling across the board, regardless of who actually wins. Plus if we get into a constitutional crisis, even more reason to be out of the markets.\n\nAny thoughts on this?

If you want to buy the ‘option’ to buy shares of AMD at a specific price, let’s say the current price of $83 bucks, and you want to be able to buy it for this price for a certain amount of time, say 1 year, then you can pay a premium for this option. The premium is going to be much less cost than buying the share of AMD outright. Currently, the premium for this is about 17 bucks. So, you can leverage your money by spending a fraction of the cost for AMD to buy the option to buy many more shares of AMD, multiplying your returns.
