Not wanting to cut my losses, greed, not  \"settling for small\" profits on home run attempt trades- which itself should be a no-no for me.  \n\nI'd go up working small, CC, credit spreads over say 10 or 20 trades, any where from $50-300  er trade then enter dumb dumb trades and throw away my money.  \n\nSort of breakdown of my 45 days  \n+4,900, winning trades, mostly CCs and credit spreads  \n-7,500, losing trades, mostly long calls, over 5000 of that on just **2** trades.    \n\nCoincidentally all my losers, long calls and/or earning plays.  \nThe big 2 losers, an earnings play on AMZN this week and a \"YoLoOOo\" on TSLA a few weeks ago when it fell below 400 thinking surely it'd bounce back to 420 by week's end... seriously... I did that.  \n\nFor fresh onto the boat folks like me, don't be a dumb dumb,  \n\n* take the time to educate yourself, don't be like me learning on the fly with real money half ass-idly and only now making a serious attempt to get comfortable with the greeks and other fundamentals after a month in already.\n* game plan your trade, size, entry, exit and stick to it.  Sizing is important, chasing bigger profits with bigger allocation per portfolio, be careful.\n* on the medium/high risk stuff, take your profits, 20-50%, view that as 100%\n* exit that losing trades, if you can't adjust, in a way that makes sense and not just to prolong the loss, take the exit\n* pay attention to your psyche, biases, etc. History doesn't always repeat, forget shoulda/woulda/couldas.\n* if you're going to gamble as in going into trades you really don't have a clue on except \"earnings\" or some other event, if you don'y yet have good understanding of IV and how it can explode premiums, gamble small.  I like this on the TSLA call, even with the price going up the call was losing value.\n* stick the your plan!\n* stay away from tsla", "id": "jl6orr", "created_utc": 1604096845.0, "score": 254, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 78, "comments": [{"body": "2500 isnt that much in the realm of learning how to trade.

I’ve blown like $8K at the option casino.\n\nYou are heading in the right direction by being honest with yourself about what went wrong and looking for feedback from others. I learned that longing stocks has been far more profitable for my style so I stick to that with the occasional options dalliance. I intend to get back into it eventually when I get my legs under me more and I’m less naïve.\n\nThe past 4-8 weeks has been tough for anyone with all the whipsaws, so treat it as tuition paid and DON’T GET SPUN. If you are looking for feedback, I think the points you list are valid, especially on size. Managing $800 in a trade is a million times easier than managing $8000. Better yet, never have naked options at all. Use only spreads because they allow you to set your max loss and let it ride.\n\nYou can see what went right in your winning trades, positive theta. You can probably keep riffing and just crank that knob up to start making money. Long put/call, that’s tough man. I don’t want to go in without knowing I have some protection WHEN (not if) the market smacks me in the face.\n\nLikewise, knowing where and how to get out is important. My successful long option trades often have had a limit order set as I can’t watch them all day. I go in, set the limit order and boom get out for a quick 20% or so gain the next day as I’m asleep! \n\nAre you often buying OTM or near to expiration? For newbies, I would suggest minimum 50 DTE or so and always ATM or ITM (though currently Dec-Jan vol is elevated so maybe even further). That will generally give you more wiggle room, but like I said I’m a big fan of spreads so you don’t have to really worry about that at all.\n\nKeep grinding, just decrease the size... I hope to see you posting here about big gains some day!", "score": 24, "replies": [{"body": "Also, there’s nothing wrong with TSLA. People love to crank the IV up on that thing and the market is red hot for its options so there could be opportunity there.
