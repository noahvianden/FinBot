{"title": "GameStop Announces Multi-year Strategic Partnership with Microsoft", "selftext": " According to Globe News Wire:\n\nGRAPEVINE, Texas and REDMOND, Wash., Oct. 08, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- **GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME)** (“The Company”) today announced that it has entered into a multi-year strategic partnership agreement with Microsoft Corp., further advancing its strategy to expand its physical and digital video game offerings, as well as enhance the Company’s retail technology infrastructure. With over 5,000+ retail stores worldwide and its world-class eCommerce platform, GameStop leverages its vast customer network, PowerUp Rewards, and omni-channel capabilities to deliver enhanced gaming solutions to its customers. Through this partnership, GameStop will standardize the Company’s business operations on Microsoft’s cloud solutions and hardware products to deliver rich new digital experiences to customers, creating the “ultimate gaming destination” for gamers in its vision to be the premier omni-channel customer access point for video game products.\n\nThe partnership includes enterprise and commercial elements.\n\n* Under this agreement, GameStop will standardize its back-end and in-store solutions on Dynamics 365, Microsoft’s portfolio of cloud-based business applications and customer data platform, empowering associates with integrated experiences across its business operations including finance, inventory, eCommerce, retail and point of sale. This will enable store associates the ability to access omni-channel insights about customer preferences and purchasing history, real time information on product availability, subscriptions, pricing, and promotions in order to provide a differentiated and personalized in-store customer experience.\n* Additionally, associates will be equipped with new Microsoft Surface devices that will transform the in-store experience and help unlock new retail experiences in the future. The mobility of Microsoft Surface will allow associates to move freely within the store footprint, meeting the needs of customers faster and more efficiently. Microsoft Surface devices have already been an important part of the digital modernization strategy for store management.\n* As part of its transformation, GameStop plans to roll out Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Teams to its stores, empowering more than 30,000 store associates with enhanced productivity and collaboration tools. With Teams, store associates will more easily be able to ask questions and share insights with one another, enabling them to provide a better customer experience. Associates will also benefit from enhanced security and identify management capabilities.  \n* Following decades as an essential provider of the Microsoft Xbox gaming platform and services, GameStop has expanded its Xbox family of product offerings to include [**Xbox All Access**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=isKe5SUpg_XM1cKKZLdi78yPAU6K0_N2llJUfofCzU6IA4V8MqjpEZ8c1ihAfS3c7tUHzYsYESBk7BgfMvgUhgCWctgvfIf_bplVrOpe7D-GXTAjyYtfHnGzrF76KOdq), which provides an Xbox console and 24 months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate to players with no upfront cost. GameStop and Microsoft will both benefit from the customer acquisition and lifetime revenue value of each gamer brought into the Xbox ecosystem.\n\nGeorge Sherman, GameStop’s Chief Executive Officer, stated: “This is an exciting day at GameStop as we announce the advancement of an important partnership that capitalizes on the power of our operating platform and significant market share in gaming to accelerate our digital transformation; drive incremental revenue streams; and over time, further monetize the digital world of gaming. Since joining the Company last April, we have been on a mission to evolve our strategy to take advantage of our undisputed leadership position in gaming. Clearly, GameStop is a top destination for an entire spectrum of gaming products, and we are excited about the opportunity to leverage our capabilities in support of the launch of the next generation of gaming consoles and expand our reach and connection to the worldwide gamer community through this partnership.”\n\n“GameStop has become a popular destination for gamers to find their favorite video games, hardware and accessories, socialize with others in the community, try out new games, and get educated on the latest tips and trends,” said Matt Renner, President, US Enterprise Commercial, Microsoft. “By harnessing the power of Dynamics 365 and Microsoft 365, GameStop will be able to modernize its technology infrastructure and support store associates and fans in new and exciting ways. This partnership also provides GameStop with advanced retail management technologies that will drive operational efficiencies throughout its omni-channel platform.”\n\nPhil Spencer, Microsoft, Executive Vice President of Gaming, added: “For many years GameStop has been a strong go-to-market partner for our gaming products, and we are excited about continuing and evolving that relationship for the launch of the Xbox Series X|S. GameStop’s extensive store base, focus on digital transformation in an omni-channel environment and expert gamer associates remain an important part of our gaming ecosystem, and we’re pleased to elevate our partnership.”\n\nJim Bell, GameStop’s Chief Financial Officer commented, “We believe Microsoft’s integrated retail technology platform will enable the continued development of our frictionless omni-channel digital environment, providing customers with an exceptional cross-channel experience for all things video gaming.” Mr. Bell continued, “By standardizing on Microsoft 365 and Dynamics 365, all accessed with Microsoft Surface devices at our fingertips, we will be able to create a better connection with our associates and provide them with powerful new tools to deliver rich engaging experiences to our customers while significantly enhancing our cross-channel view of inventory ensuring the most efficient delivery of products to our customers.”", "id": "j7ixnw", "created_utc": 1602182955.0, "score": 47, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 89, "comments": [{"body": "just fuck my shit up fam... one hour before it got halted\n\nhttps://imgur.com/RxOpfQY", "score": 30, "replies": [{"body": "F", "score": 8, "replies": []}, {"body": "F", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "At least you weren’t the guy who sold 200 10/16 $10C.

I came to make a comment about your post sounding like an AA speech, but you’ve already taken care of that.\n\nGood for you. Don’t discount buying options altogether just yet though imo. There’s a time and place for selling options and there’s a time and place for buying options. There’s no denying that significant returns can be achieved with long options.\n\nWhen I first started selling options, I also completely moved away from buying options, but slowly I made my way back to it. Now I do both. But I generally try to buy 6+ months expiration and preferably at or itm, and I have a plan to exit (generally playing ER run-ups and IV expansion and exiting a day or two before ER, and then at that point I may switch to selling some options on the ticker if I want more for an IV crush ;)). I also buy some careful LEAPS here and there.\n\nI found that learning the ins and outs of selling options made me a smarter buyer of options as well. Because now that I understand what I’m looking for as a seller, I know to avoid exactly those things as a buyer. For example, since option sellers are often looking for theta decay and inflated IV as major components in their favor, I know that is exactly what I need to avoid when buying options, so hence I buy with plenty of DTE and attempt to buy when IV is relatively lower and expected to run up (such as before an ER as I mentioned). And since as an option seller I’m looking at that juicy theta decay once an option hits around 45 DTE, as a long option holder I know that is the latest I can hold a long option and I need to exit before 45 DTE in most cases, preferably 60 DTE.\n\nThe whole stereotype of the ‘wsb options buyer’ is people buying very otm weekly options, or buying options a day before ER at the peak of IV, and expecting to hit home runs. And certainly this type of situations are generally in the favor of the option seller and not the buyer, and that’s why we’re here ;).\n\nAs with any other style of trading, it is possible to make money with just about any sort of strategy as long as one has adequate risk management in place. Traders who lose their hat and jump from strategy to strategy generally don’t find themselves in trouble time and time again because they were using the wrong strategy, they find themselves in trouble because they had poor risk management.

That's a ratio spread. When it gets assigned the spreads value will be the distance between strikes, so getting assigned at $10 for example, with a $2 wide spread. That is selling a second $10 put and buying a $12 put means you get the premium plus the $2. This means your cost on buying is actually $8 minus premium rather than just the $12 minus $12 puts premium. You end up with a lower cost to own when you get assigned but sacrifice put premium to get it. One thing to note, in order not to pay a debit which I don't recommend, the short strike's premium has to be at least half the ATM. So the $10 premium would have to be at least half the $12 premium. I like to shoot for the short strikes premium doubled to be 125% of the long option, just a bit more, so there's some credit to take home if there's no assignment.
