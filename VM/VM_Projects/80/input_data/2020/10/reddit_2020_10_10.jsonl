Yes Gamestop has that list but at the same time Microsoft has its own list of Xbox (and some PC) gamers. It's almost certain that when it comes to Xbox usage Microsoft's own data is a lot more comprehensive than Gamestop's. You could argue that users != buyers, but at the end of the day it's still the end-users who are influencing/driving a lot of the purchasing decisions. \n\nSo if Xbox data is redundant then what else is useful from Gamestop's data? They'd primarily have Nintendo and Sony customer data but IMO those have less value. Microsoft could potentially convert some Nintendo and Sony users to Xbox, but console-loyalists usually stay on their own platform unless they find another console-exclusive really enticing. With cross-platform play and Microsoft's expansion into PC gaming that argument weakens. Microsoft's game studio acquisitions do allow them to pump out more exclusives but I highly doubt Gamestop plays a huge role/synergy with this either. \n\nAt the end of the day I see GME and MSFT as more akin to a Nikola-GM partnership.
