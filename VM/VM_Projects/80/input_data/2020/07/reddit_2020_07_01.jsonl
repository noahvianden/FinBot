It’s a bit more expensive relative to some other popular picks, but it’s a great stock to own. You can never go wrong owning shares in a company that is becoming a utilities company for a society becoming reliant on a mobile OS to deliver goods, services, and social engagement products. I think people still view Apple as a consumer products company.. and although that’s their superpower now, that isn’t their ambition long term. \n\nThere’s way more compute in your pocket than ever before, and the key for the next generation is more specific, context aware devices/capability that report back to a centralized OS. Apple is sitting on a goldmine of data that has yet to be utilized via on device processing. The end result is their native products become custom tailored to the end user, and with the ARM/macOS catalyst apps, it becomes much easier to propagate this data cross platform to serve more people in more places.\n\nThere are clues of this everywhere if you look closely on how they’re thinking about this. It’s not just about services from a traditional subscription lens, but relevancy of data from multiple integrated sources (ie, CarPlay, Maps, watchOS, Apple Card) that can provide a more complete picture on exactly what your habits are on a more granular level (not just cookies) to serve you better and monetize better. You no longer have to be scrolling and tapping a screen to register your intent. It just learns as you go about your day in this new world of iOS.\n\nYou can start to see some of this in iOS already in subtle ways.. for example, the category color in Maps are in sync with your spend categories in Card, which suggests that there’s a system to this madness that hasn’t come to fruition. \n\nRevenue is always a lagging indicator of success in tech. I’ve seen people be skeptical about Apple since I started following them in 2004.
