Its more complex than what you directly see in the catalog on disney+. Netflix on the other hand has a lot of third party content, and their unique content catalog is not great.

Other content they have is done as a partnership and do not own it directly. The contraction of third party content to their own streaming service is going to really start to hurt Netflix in the coming years. They are going to become highly reliant on their personal catalog and that needs to be far more robust to actually hold peoples interest as much as other content providers will.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDisney on the other hand has a broader catalog of content to present in a single streaming package and they are doing it slowly so that they can stay under the radar in a way. Disney owns ABC, Fox, ESPN, Endemol, Marvel, Lucasfilm, National Geographic, and A&E.

This includes more than just marvel and disney movies, it includes things like the alien franchise, indiana jones, terminator, die hard, planet of the apes, its a long list. Disneys catalog is huge and they can make more from exploiting it in their own streaming services than they will from blanket cost contracts with companies like netflix.

And Netflix may actually be saturated in some markets.  Ask yourself how many people you know that *don't* have Netflix other than a 95 year old who never will?\n\nSecond, penetration in other markets doesn't mean profitability.  They charge something like $3 elsewhere.  \n\nThird, they're still not actually profitable on a true and sustainability basis.  They use fine print to claim a technical profit, but you don't want to own fake profit any more than you want to buy fool's gold.\n\nFourth, they don't produce content \"at a reasonable cost\".  Much the opposite.  Netflix operates like the most drunken sailor in all of history took over a studio.  Their studio spending is insane and orders of magnitude beyond what would make any if other studio bankrupt in one day.  They overpay for everything, test nothing, pay $65 million for a few stand up routines.  In the real world, studios have to pinch every penny, and even then they fold up if they make a mistake.\n\nNetflix does the above because they have insane levels of debt.  Even if they used their most \"profitable\" quarter, they'd need 400 of those quarters (equivalent to 100 years) to pay off just their existing debt,  except they're not even doing that.  They're taking in even *more* debt.  They're a financial House of Cards.\n\nAnd none of that touches on the fact they can't get away with price increases, or subscribers will freak out.  They tried to in test markets last year to see how much it would mute the growth.  It was a disaster.  They didn't just slow growth, it reserved it.  They had to cancel their plans for price hikes.\n\nNor does it mention that financial baby Netflix has done all their \"winning\" against no competition, but now they face Disney, Google, Apple, Amazon, AT&T and Facebook.  Just the most evil and richest competitors one could imagine.  Their \"winning\" happened when they had all the content and weren't paying for it.  That's going going gone now, and there's only so many times someone will rewatch Stranger Things season 1.  Even Disney has a century worth of the most reachable films ever made, and people are complaining six months into Disney+ that $36/year is too much.\n\nThe path for Netflix to thread the needle and perfectly come out the end is possible, but very very tight.\n\nThey needed to get to dominance and true profitability *before* competition arrived, and they've failed to do so.\n\nAll of that said, actual company robustness often has no connection to stock price, so I wouldn't be that surprised to see $NFLX go way up from here.\n\nPut a reminder on this.
