In the EV space, a rising tide floats all boats and there is shitloads of room in the market for all comers. \n\nHowever,\n\nFrom my understanding, it wasn‚Äôt just infotainment software that was unfinished, they were having huge issues with the functionality software. Because it‚Äôs an electric car, most things that a car normally does are now fully software problems. I know they had a bunch of issues with the ABS software, and there were a few other major problems. And, they had 10-15k cars sitting in a lot that needed manual software updates to fix these massive issues. You heard that right. In 2020, they had to go plug in over 10k cars to update them because the software they were using was non functional and they didn‚Äôt have the capability to do it wirelessly.\n\nYou know how Tesla keeps putting out OTA updates that improve 0-60 speeds and increase range and the like? That‚Äôs because most of what these cars do is software. The pack management software, the electronic motor software, braking software and more. Infotainment is by far only the tip of the iceberg. I‚Äôd actually argue that software is actually one of the most important things in a NEV. \n\nThere‚Äôs a reason that VW is going to be spending $9B developing their software stack for their platform, it‚Äôs that important. BTW, $9B is a joke, talk about a dinosaur needing to throw money at the problem. \n\nI don‚Äôt actually know forsure that it won‚Äôt be out in volume from the start, but I know they‚Äôve been building these for months to try and build up 30k units for initial deliveries. My totally amateur guess though, is that it will be 2022 or 2023 at the earliest before they are putting out more than 100-150k units a year.

Perhaps there is room in the market for ID3 and Model 3  at the current prices and buyers will simply pick the car that best suits their needs.\n\nLonger term, I expect Model 3 prices to slowly drift lower, but any Tesla car made in the local market should always have lower prices...
