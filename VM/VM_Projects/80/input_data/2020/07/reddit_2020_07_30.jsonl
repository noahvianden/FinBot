{"title": "U.S. G.D.P. Fell 9.5 Percent", "selftext": "\nEconomic output fell at its fastest pace on record last spring as the coronavirus pandemic forced businesses across the United States to close their doors and kept millions of Americans shut in their homes for weeks.\n\nGross domestic product — the broadest measure of goods and services produced — fell 9.5 percent in the second quarter of the year, the Commerce Department said Thursday. On an annualized basis, the standard way of reporting quarterly economic data, G.D.P. fell at a rate of 32.9 percent.\n\nThe collapse was unprecedented in its speed and breathtaking in its severity. The only possible comparisons in modern American history came during the Great Depression and the demobilization after World War II, both of which occurred before the advent of modern economic statistics.\n\nUnlike past recessions, this one was a result of a conscious decision to suspend economic activity to slow the spread of the virus. Congress pumped trillions of dollars into the economy to sustain households and businesses, limit long-term damage and allow for a rapid rebound.\n\nThe plan worked at first. In recent weeks, however, cases have surged in much of the country. Data from public and private sources indicate a pullback in economic activity, reflecting consumer unease and renewed shutdowns.\n\n“In another world, a sharp drop in activity would have been just a good, necessary blip while we addressed the virus,”said Heather Boushey, president of the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, a progressive think tank. “From where we sit in July, we know that this wasn’t just a short-term blip.”\n\n\nThe number of Americans filing new claims for state unemployment benefits totaled 1.43 million last week, the Labor Department reported Thursday.\n\nIt was the 19th straight week that the tally exceeded one million, an unheard-of figure before the coronavirus pandemic. And it was the second weekly increase in a row after nearly four months of declines, a sign of how the rebound in cases has undercut the economy’s nascent recovery. Claims for the previous week totaled 1.42 million.\n\nNew claims for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, the government’s program aimed at covering freelancers, the self-employed and other workers not covered by traditional unemployment benefits, totaled 830,000.

So I think there would be a push for low income ppl to get a new job, but ppl in my situation arent going to go back to work and risk exposure for an extra $1/2 an hr and that would personally make my resume look worse taking on a job like that. \n\nSo the only difference that $600 makes in my situation is spending.
