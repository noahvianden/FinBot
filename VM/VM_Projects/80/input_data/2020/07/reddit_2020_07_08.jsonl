Producing more energy isn't a problem, it's balancing the peak vs lulls and using either molten salt or hydrogen is a potential solution. \n\nThen the argument would get into why would you pursue this methodology as opposed to pure battery storage and that would stem somewhat from what materials are needed to create suitable batteries. There can be some arguments had that the environmental impact of the strip mining for the rare earths needed for batteries can be a bigger harm than the impact of the petroleum process (note not making the claim but that there's an argument there). The other impact is obviously that batteries are heavy as well as take a long time to charge where as hydrogen fuel cells will weigh similar to current fuel tanks and fill within the same reasonable time frame (note this argument is dependent on truckers not being able to time the battery charge with their mandated breaks). \n\nIt is more a bridge between current (gas/diesel based) and mass produced electric semi that suits the needs of long-hauls. \n\nMusk is a one of a kind, but all I would look for in a CEO is leadership abilities and can they assemble a good to great team.

Another factor is that you just can't get the energy density you need for heavy duty applications with batteries.

E.g. a battery for a sedan is around 400 lbs but over 1000 for a pickup, and about 4 times the cost. And of course, the more weight you add the more power is needed to move it, so there's a limit to what you can accomplish with batteries. One challenge with on-board hydrogen for cars is the size limitation for tanks - but when it comes to vehicles like buses, that's not much of an issue.
