{"title": "Too poor to enjoy AMZN quarantine tendies but still hungry? UPS will deliver", "selftext": "  \n\nUPS has earnings on 7/30 and it should be a good tendie-ing opportunity. Obviously there has been an uptick in the parcel delivery service based on the increase in online shopping due to COVID-19. FedEx, the other big parcel delivery company, had earnings on 6/30 where they reported EPS of $2.53 vs. consensus estimate of $1.42. Revenue was down YoY by 2.5%. This caused share price to jump 12% (140 -> 158) overnight:\n\n[FDX Jump](https://preview.redd.it/39cn8pp0c7c51.jpg?width=1913&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4fb85bcffab89ab3e3ec319e3fe476cdba6a4a82)\n\nAt the same time UPS jumped up and has been hovering around the same:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Hang in there bby](https://preview.redd.it/q7mt4a5fc7c51.jpg?width=1919&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=24a8f8596c501254ad2c159e5431311a9170ce49)\n\nFedEx has a much lower contribution margin per package delivered as they are trying to cut prices to compete against UPS, which is approx. 3x larger anyway.  Anecdotally, I watch the UPS truck pull up to my apartment building and stay for around 30-45mins every day delivering packages, while I see the FedEx truck come maybe 2x a day where the driver will deliver one or two package.  It is my belief the UPS, as the king of logistics, has a much more efficient delivery system which allows more packages to be delivered per trip and thus increases the contribution margin of each package delivered by reducing variable costs related to vehicles and wages.  This is why UPS is going to kill earnings even harder than that guy in the FedEx costume killed that judge.\n\nI personally have 7/31 $125 and 8/7 $125c.\n\nTLDR: Get free money because people are scared to go outside\n\nEdit: Down a bit but I‚Äôm not too worried. I was doing a little reading and found that UPS used a fuel surcharge to cover that cost of their business right. But it‚Äôs set for a contract period, meaning that there is a lag between fuel prices actually changing and the fuel surcharge being adjusted. I‚Äôm thinking since fuel has been cheap across the board since Covid started they are probably making extra bank on their charge.
