Although I have been very successful in the past predicting movements traders should always make an effort to adjust their positions based on changing political and media landscapes. This approach isn‚Äôt meant to be any more accurate than a meteorologist predicting the weather. Take positions at your own risk and always do your own due diligence. I release these for thoughtful criticism from traders who use different approaches for analysis.\n\n**Tl;dr:** There no resistance left and there‚Äôs no reason to believe we‚Äôll see a significant drop (below 305) without so major news to throw the market into turmoil again.\n\nTicker: $SPY\n\nIntervals: 1W, 1D, 4H\n\nIndicators: MACD, KDJ, MA(13 & 30), NetVolume, VPVR, Relative Volume\n\nCharts: https://imgur.com/gallery/k5CRAcE\n\n**Signals: **\n\n1W: MACD Bullish Diverging, Net Volume (397.5M) Bullish, KDJ Slightly Overbought Nuetral\n\n1D: MACD Neutral Inconclusive, Net Volume (62M) Bearish, KDJ Overbought Slightly ullish \n\n4H: MACD Convergent Inconclusive, Net Volume (23M) Bullish, KDJ Overbought Nuetral/Slight Bullish Divergence\n\nKey Supports: \n\n305\n\n213\n\n218\n\nKey Resistances:\n\n323\n\nPosition: Put Credit Spread, 305/300 7/27\n\nTargets: Buying to open position if the market retests support at 318 or below. Take profit and stop-loss is not necessary due to the nature of the position. Just let theta do the work\n\nNews: [California Gov.

[Greg Abbott](https://www.texastribune.org/directory/greg-abbott/) said Thursday there is no statewide shutdown looming.](https://www.texastribune.org/2020/07/16/texas-shutdown-greg-abbott/\\)\n\n[Some fantastic DD by u/MiltDavis](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/htqy2k/dd\\_your\\_tendie\\_stimulus\\_vxx\\_qqq\\_and\\_spy\\_during/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=ios\\_app&utm\\_name=iossmf\\)\n\n**Analysis: **\n\n**Technical:** Momentum has neutralized on almost every interval. $SPY has passed through every major resistance in its volume profile with only 1% of the total active float above current market price. With almost every long position currently held yielding a profit there is no reason to expect a bearish shift in sentiment without a significant news catalyst.\n\n**Narrative:** Although stocks are closing at all-time highs behind the scenes investors are keeping their options open. Gold and other precious metals have been bought up at a historical price moving in step with stock prices. Even treasury bond prices have seen solid gains over the last two weeks with TLT holding a modest 2% gain since July second. Despite these gains VIX remains stuck at higher than average levels.\n\n**So what‚Äôs happening?**\n\nCommitment to accommodating monetary and fiscal policy has propped the market up to all-time highs while doing nothing to quell the underlying feeling of uncertainty most investors are experiencing. The only thing certain at this point is inflation as demonstrated by consistent depreciation in $UUP. It‚Äôs simple really, the only place you can‚Äôt put your money is‚Ä¶. Money?\n\nIf $NFLX earnings have shown us anything it‚Äôs that even the star players of the COVID-19 crisis are going to report mediocre growth this season. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if $AMZN fairs better than Netflix but will it meet investor expectations? Likely not, but we‚Äôre hostages of fiscal policy.\n\n**So what do we do?** \n \n\nDo what the big boys do‚Ä¶ hedge! There‚Äôs a reason stocks are reaching ATH while typically negatively correlated ETF‚Äôs are also seeing similar gains as well as the VIX holding value. No one knows for sure where to place their money they just know they can‚Äôt hold cash. \n\nWith a second possible stimulus coming a final rally through the stubborn resistance at 323 is well within the realm of possibility but try to remember the negotiations prior to the last stimulus bill‚Ä¶. Constant bickering back and forth, meeting that almost always went nowhere until suddenly something was passed. Now, a more autistic trader than I may be willing to try and time bipartisanship, but I‚Äôve been in this country a little to long for that. Let time work for you, any position with theta on your side makes sense, but my preferred play here is a PCS (put credit spread).\n\nWith tech showing relative weakness and $MRNA announcing a possible vaccine may be on the horizon expect money to quickly flow out of Covid-19 stars and back to long neglected industries like tourism, gaming, sports, and retail.\n\nSo, to summarize, we‚Äôre seeing market wide rebalancing, because the truth is the rollercoaster is over. Your deep OTM $SPY puts are fucc, you didn‚Äôt outsmart the market. The bear is defeated for now. \n\nYoutube Walkthrough on TA: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfK7Acy691E\n\nAlternative Plays: JETS, DIS, VIX", "id": "hub9gk", "created_utc": 1595204122.0, "score": 37, "upvote_ratio": 0.74, "num_comments": 81, "comments": [{"body": "Damn that‚Äôs a lot of words.
