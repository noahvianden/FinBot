{"title": "NFLX Earnings Trade?", "selftext": "Hi, I'm posting a few thoughts on earnings that are intended to be helpful in trying to gain consistency in trading.\n\nWith NFLX earnings today after the close, I'm seeing a lot of newer traders discussing buying far out of the money calls in the hopes that NFLX \"kills it\" and rallies huge after earnings.  As a word of warning, although this \"could\" work, it is one of the lowest probability trades you can do.\n\nThe market makers (and computers) have already priced in a $43 move either up or down in the stock.  So in order to make decent money in a long call or long put, the stock would need to move much more than the $43 move that is already priced in.  In other words, you could buy a $600 call, the stock jumps up $43 with earnings, and you lose 100% of your money invested in the trade (assuming you bought a $600 call that expires Friday).  In addition to the move being \"baked in\" the Implied Volatility is at peak levels right before earnings.  Friday morning that Implied Volatility will instantly drop back to normal, and the premium portion of the options will implode.  All in all, it makes buying an out of the money call a lotto ticket trade.\n\n[The \\\\\"market maker move\\\\\" is shown on this platform, but you can also get close to that figure buy adding up the at the money call and at the money put. ](https://preview.redd.it/cb1i9hx028b51.png?width=1277&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e4f351c719e9ff45671cbcf7d6ab0e535612b16)\n\nInstead, consider what the market makers do for earnings.  They sell the at the money call and the at the money put as a naked straddle in order to capture the rapid premium decay after earnings are announced.  They make a living doing this.\n\nPersonally, I'm not a huge fan of naked options over earnings, so instead, I'll do an at the money Iron Condor (also called an Iron Fly when the sold strikes are the same).  This is selling a naked straddle but with the protection of long options to contain your maximum risk in case the stock does have one of those rare moves that is well beyond what is already \"expected.\"\n\nThis is what the risk to reward looks like on a 1 lot trade on a $45 wide (expected move) Iron Fly on NFLX.  (To reduce your max risk, you can narrow the width of the spread).\n\n[Max profit and max loss selling the $525 at the money call and put and buying options $45 out on either side to establish maximum risk.](https://preview.redd.it/6qyz6wg838b51.png?width=1051&format=png&auto=webp&s=19a74d1cbf750af6d80ab2aaa551e476e5f980ed)\n\nThis is simply a bet that the move on NFLX is already baked into the options price, and by the time the stock opens Friday morning, it will be up or down less than the $43 expected move.\n\nA few notes on this trade:\n\n* It's not guaranteed to work, of course, but the odds of getting a profit on this setup is much higher, over time, than buying an out of the money call.  (And don't get me wrong, it is amazing having calls when a stock explodes - this strategy is more for consistent base hits than occasional grand slam home runs).\n* Tip: If you normally risk $1,500 on a trade on a normal stop loss, then just line up your \"max loss\" with this.  That way if the trade hits max loss, it is just like hitting a stop out vs. trading too big and having a max loss trade be a disaster.\n* The closer NFLX opens to your sold strikes Friday morning, or anytime on Friday, the higher your profit.\n* If NFLX does open up or down right around the expected move, you can wait for retracements.  (The expected move often acts as support or resistance, as there is a lot of money riding on it staying within that range).\n* Max loss occurs if, by Friday's close, NFLX is trading above the long options, in this case, $570 or $480.  I always position size assuming it is NOT going to work, so I'm not freaking out if it has a big move against me.  Base hits, not home runs.\n* In general, I try to get out at 50% of the credit received.  In this case, the credit is $32.25, so my exit would be set near $16.00.  I've found that to be a fairly consistent level to exit if the stock is staying within the \"expected move\" parameters.\n\nHope it helps!\n\nEdit:  Adding a screenshot of trade after the close.  Currently, NFLX is trading down around $475, so it's kicking me in the teeth.  I would need the stock to rally back to $500 at some point tomorrow in order to get a scratch/small gain on the fly.  If it opens up down within the expected move, then I might sell some 450 put credit spreads to bring in additional credit to offset the loss.  If it opens below the expected move, I might buy back the short put and let the long put run but that brings on a lot of additional risk.  Should be an interesting Friday.\n\n[NFLX Earnings Trade](https://preview.redd.it/7bmg3kps9ab51.png?width=1434&format=png&auto=webp&s=1658a25e46ee264ea96f09cf0c746d19d49bfcbb)\n\nEdit: Ok now it's Friday after the close.  Did NFLX follow those \"expected move\" guidelines or not?  Here's a chart that includes the after-hours action.  After hours will usually push through the expected move, as it did after earnings.  Then, with the cash open it was back to \"at\" and eventually \"within\" the expected move of $43.  The move up to $500 allowed me to get out of the iron fly at a small gain (if you don't open near the closing price, the goal is to get out on a move inside of the expected move once the after-hours action has settled down).  Ideally, we open up or move closer to the previous days closing price, as that would give us the biggest bang for the buck on the trade.\n\nAnyway, hope it's helpful in understanding earnings moves.  My preference is to sell options to take advantage of premium decay and the tendency of a stock to stay within its expected move vs. buying OTM calls and puts hoping for a move that is greater than what's already been priced in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i4xrhk2dghb51.png?width=737&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c019f02d0ceffeae742227417f61b38dbd2eaac", "id": "hsa0qf", "created_utc": 1594907581.0, "score": 160, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 80, "comments": [{"body": "This is nicely thought out but ...\n\n(1) In this market, NFLX could easily break though the thresholds that identify maximum loss, just like TWLO did in their last earnings reports. NFLX has been tame on reaction to earnings over the last year (at least on the day after earnings), but it has had explosive reactions in the more distant past (2018).\n(2) If you wait for \"retracement\" you are just as likely to lose the remainder of your bet as you are to gain. We play earnings strangles a lot and we always track how a stock does after the earnings event up to expiry, including a history of NFLX and trading immediately or waiting seems to be a more or less random wash.\n(3) You will not likely have the option to use stops or any other trading device to \"get out at 50% of the credit received.\" All of the action on earnings happens overnight and often produces a massive discontinuity. The market may close on earnings day (Thur in this case) with NFLX at 520 and options priced accordingly, but at the moment trading at 3.5 sigma. Say NFLX has an unexpected sterling report at 3:00 PM PDT and you watch helplessly as NFLX soars to 605 in the aftermarket (likely? may not but NFLX was trading right at 575 on July 13). By the time the option market opens at 9:30 NYT the next morning and you are crushed.\n\nWe not only trade earnings strangles (very selective) but we track candidates with daemons from 4 or 5 days before earnings right up to expiry. We decided to not trade NFLX but are tracking a hypothetical strangle that was set up Monday. Here is something interesting about what we saw with NFLX:\n\nThese are in reference to Friday Jul 17 expiries: At 06:42:04 AM PDT, when NFLX had just traded at 568.81, the 575 call had a peg at 27.40 and the 565 put had a peg at 26.12, resulting is a position cost of $5,352 per strangle plus fees (less than $2 in our case).\n\nThe next day NFLX plunged and IV soared (we track our own measures of implied daily volatility and dynamically compare them to multiple measures of historical daily volatility, all calculated in-house) and at Tuesday 6/14/20 7:00:56 AM PDT the NFLX peg was at 510.62, the 575 Call was at 8.87 but the 565 Put was pegged at an astonishing 65.03. An immediate reversal of the trade at that moment would have produce a profit of $2,048.\n\nJust a few minutes ago, at 7:41:55 PDT today (Thur) that same strangle was still running a profit of $1,468. [Mind you, we, regretfully, are not trading it, we decided against that and are merely tracking the trade that we would have made. It is also the case that our options trade through models and given the current liquidity of NFLX options our trades would have been within a few cents of the peg].\n\nTo OP, I like the reasoning you employ and you did a great writeup and the sub benefited from that. And with NFLX there is a good chance that you will make money on a condor because NFLX has been tame over the last four earnings reports. But some of your assumptions are a little off (you are understating your risk) and NFLX does have a history of explosive earnings if you go back to 2018 for example. \n\nAt any rate, good luck on the trade (LOL, we are not the counter-party this time around, at least not for NFLX, so I can be sincere in my sentiment here) and double-thanks for a thoughtful and well-written strategy piece.\n\n[Edit: corrections]", "score": 37, "replies": [{"body": "Great thoughts and good points.

I line up max loss with my risk per trade parameters, that way if max loss is hit, it is the same as my stop loss on the trade.

If earnings on Tu, we go in Thur. If earning on Thur, we go in Fri or Mon. Reason: possible to exit before earnings (like the current NFLX example) and IV rises to crazy levels in the final 3 days of trade.\n\nWe only trade the Friday expiry after the earnings report (quite a bit of research went into this ... we used to experiment with more distant expiries). \n\nOur model (Bayesian) does the trade. We look at the prelims, say green light or no, tell the model. In a few seconds it finds the price of the underlying, finds the put and call closest to the money, checks for symmetry and adjusts (if NFLX is at 512 it will choose 510 put and 515 call) but if NFLX is at 14.80 it will choose the 510 put and 520 call ... we want deltas (abs value) as close as possible. \nIt then pulls in B/A and uses a complicated pegging algo to submit limit orders. We trade both legs separately, believing that we can get a slightly better price.\n\nWe sell within 2 minutes of open the day after earnings, both legs, no exceptions and no regrets. Our algo tracks the history of the position upon until about two hours before expiry (and it is on the basis of what we learned from this that we established our DON'T THINK JUST TRADE OUT NOW! strategy. A delayed trade can take a 60% profit to zero in one hour (and can also double it, but the former happens more than the latter - the market is crazy red hot in the first minute of trade)\n\nMind you, I am NOT suggesting that it is easy to make money with strangles. Many of the veterans here caution that you should stay away from them and I don't really dispute that UNLESS you are ready to do a lot research and are an extremely disciplined trader with clear rules of engagement.\n\nBut also it is easy to experiment with strangles for cheaper stocks (no NFLX, GOOG, TSLA or AMZN) - but maybe AMD? \n\n[We are not big on backtesting - we don't do it all for options.

This flagged as irregular options activity in financial news because the volume was so much higher than normal.\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/pete-najarian-sees-unusual-options-183510201.html\n\nThis looks like an earnings play, because earnings are on 7/23 and the 8/21 option was the next one after earnings.  Expected EPS is much lower than usual, estimated at .08\nhttps://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/stm/earnings\n\nI figured someone with information and money must know something about STM, so I dug into their Q1 earnings report for hints.  They gave their guidance for Q2 assuming their manufacturing plants would be locked down for much of Q2, and on reduced demand for electric vehicles and the other tech products they support.\n\nHowever, their 3 manufacturing locations: Muar Malaysia, Calamba Philippines, and Shenzhen China were not locked down very long.  Shenzhen China was not locked down  April-Jun, Malaysia's lockdown was eased and manufacturing reopened as early as 4 May, and Calamba Philippines was under lockdown only until 1 May (The lockdown extension beyond this only applied to select areas near the capital).\n\nhttps://www.malaymail.com/news/malaysia/2020/05/04/malaysia-relaxes-its-covid-19-partial-lockdown-today-so-what-can-we-expect/1862713\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-24/philippines-extends-lockdown-of-capital-nearby-areas-to-may-15#:~:text=Philippine%20regions%20under%20a%20looser%20quarantine%20can%20resume,that%20was%20among%20the%20fastest%20growing%20in%20Asia.\n\nFurther, electric cars did not suffer badly from lower demand during the pandemic from what I can find:\nhttps://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Europe-s-shift-to-electric-cars-picks-up-despite-15409372.php\n\nhttps://www.investors.com/news/electric-car-sales-china-continue-recovery-may-2020-led-by-tesla/\n\nIt doesn't make sense that analysts predict greatly reduced EPS on a company that supports electric cars and other tech industries (hmm what companies have been flourishing this quarter, I forgot).  The company was locked down for about as many days in March as they were Q2, so they will probably hit earnings similar to if not better than Q1.  If they beat earnings by more than double, I can see why a 8/21 35c would print, I'm in.\n\nEdit:  Actually switch to the 30c option.
