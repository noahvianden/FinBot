On the other hand, they had additional legal costs etc. because of those same scandals.

This may be the result of legal costs and settlements but I can't imagine they would be dragging earnings per share down so much.\n\nSecondly, they recently announced job cuts for thousands of their employees. This certainly doesn't mean they are in a dire situation, but to me, that warrants some amount of caution that their returns may underperform the financial sector in the short-term.\n\nOverall though, I think Wells is a really attractive buy at the price it's at and if it can return to earnings similar to 2019 and prior, buying it now will be a steal.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah agreed.

If JNJ get 'unlucky' and one of their competitors makes a breakthrough before them then the same could just as easily happen to JNJ. The other problem with R&D is that the Patents have relatively short expiry dates, so even though they have a niché for some products now, there's nothing to stop identical products being released soon when the patents expire; that's why they have to rely on continuous breakthroughs, so they can maintain the status of having the 'best' products.", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "Jacobs engineering group", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Gov budgets are so tight because of unemployment.
