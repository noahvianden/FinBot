There in mandatory insurance for a basic package of healthcare and optional insurance for additional covering. But it's partially subsidized by government and employers. If you have a job, part of your salary is deducted for healthcare, then you pay income taxes and form what remains you can pay the mandatory insurance. (the part you pay from you nett income is relatively cheap, about 1000 to 1400 euro/year). First 2 years of paid sick leave is 100% payed by the employer! They can insure for that but rates go up immediately when an employee gets sick. This makes companies _extremely_ reluctant to hire anyone. I have 24 (mostly)payed holidays, but this varies a lot, some countries have more than twice as many, for example Italy who is now asking the Dutch government for financial corona help because they (Italy) wants to stay the richest country in Europa.

(except for government workers, which get payed anyway when they are on strike). Europe is just as fu*ed up as anywhere else :-)\n\nI would not say \"Unions are very strong everywhere in the EU\". The influence of unions here is limited to talk to the government about improving the government safety rules (they can't make any safety rules themselves), talk to sector representatives and the government about wage increases for the whole sector (not specific companies), and go on strike. (which doesn't happen a lot, except in France, since the income you miss when on strike is similar to the typical 0.x% wage increases.) Also, since few employees are members of unions, it's also difficult to get a large enough percentage of employees to participate in the strike, and if not, a judge can ban the strike and not turning up after a ban would mean loosing the job without unemployment benefits.", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "It’s not that simple.

No one knows for sure but these papers were not or are no longer the US banking and somehow EU (uK and German Banks an founds)  seems to be the most likely candidates given their very active role in the 2008 crises and the shielding they get from their respective governments. This does not contradicts the statement above that 2008 greed crises was bad for a lot of economies, but the greed was widespread in EU banking system that unconsciously bought into these bundled loans and their derivatives instead of investing in stocks of innovative companies in the EU.\n\nThis is the other aspect of EU crises that goes with a faster aging of the population: the absolute adversity to embrace competitive risk. You can call it well fare or cautious growth policy to preserve social stability but the effects are the same, stifling innovation and  failing spinning off new type of industries. Look, this is a strategic posture that EU has decided, so it is really hard to see from within because, as every strategy, it has been widely accepted for so long time that it comes as a natural posture. \n\nEU has decided that their strategic role is to play second fiddle on the world stage.\n\nEven if this is a less risk/higher reward bet, still is not enough to guarantee future performance at keeping the current lead as the wealthiest concentration of human capital in the world.\n\nCOVID crise has opened up a first crack in the model because the disproportional way it affects people above 50 years old, and average age in EU is really old.\n\nItaly for example has now (due to COVID ) more people leaving off pensions and subsidies then actually working.
