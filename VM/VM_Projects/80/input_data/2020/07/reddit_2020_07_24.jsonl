I do not need this money for least 3 years. I have a permanent place to live and decent steady income with total of 120K in my 401K and Roth IRA altogether and additional 10K in personal savings . My goal is growth and more then preservation. I can share the stocks that I bought last week for the first time. Can't believe I could have been a millionaire if I bought Tesla or Amazon share but I didn't know anything about investing and finally realizing after a bad day at work, I need to grow this.", "id": "hwrqdw", "created_utc": 1595550907.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.43, "num_comments": 80, "comments": [{"body": "What happens if you don't get a serious reply?", "score": 29, "replies": [{"body": "The serious police comes into the thread to seriously consider writing your a letter", "score": 22, "replies": [{"body": "Why do you need money in 3 years?", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Most like to get married/wedding and buy a house only if I have a kid by then.

You'll get a variety of opinions...none in which is 100% correct.\n\nOne side of the argument is to place your money in index funds. That's usually your best bet. Low cost Index funds track the market and are a good way to Invest. The problem I see there is that the market is overvalued. You can see this by what happened with Microsoft yesterday...and others as well. So if you put your money in the market, it could easily fall 20-30% from here. Most people would say to just dollar cost average (maybe 5% of your portfolio in index funds each month to average in).\n\nThe other side of the stock argument is that stocks will rise because of money printing and the Fed. The thought here is high inflation and that will increase asset values. Stocks. Investments. Houses. Basketball Cards. Art. Most things.\n\nNow I fall on the side that the market has gotten ahead of itself and people are wildly speculating...even more than they did last year...across asset classes. I think prices will fall once liquidity becomes an issue... essentially when the Fed stops printing money. Lots of businesses are in a bad financial situation with many of them being propped up with cheap loans...think Cruise lines, hotels, airlines. \n\nThe same goes for housing but there are some other trends occuring. Apartment prices are falling in many expensive area because of the virus... think Manhattan...San Francisco. Those people leaving those areas are looking for cheaper  places to live while others are looking for houses instead of apartment... because in a pandemic it sucks living in an apartment. As a result housing prices have been rising and supply continues to be constrained. You can see it with house prices for existing home sales and numbers reported by the major builders. However, there are people that really cannot afford to live in thier house or apartment because they lost their job. Those people have been allowed to stay in their residence because of city laws allowing them to not be kicked out for a couple of months while we manage the COVID. However those rules are ending and we'll see evictions increase. So there is a flux here that is still occuring.\n\nAs a result I think cash is a good place to be through the end of the year. Or some sort of very save bond. Very safe bond. \n\nI think the election is a big risk. I think COVID during winter is a big risk. And I think that deals will be had once a lot of these issues reach a stable equalibrum.\n\nI would say that my belief is not common. But I think I'm right. In that situation I would advise to hold cash and look for an opportunity to buy the house you want in the future...or re-enter the stock market through indexing at a point when the market falls back to near where it was back in March.\n\nAgain nobody knows the future. Congrats on your savings. It's a great achievement.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Question: you assume the Fed will stop providing liquidity.  What makes you think that?  Even today, they were ready to provide liquidity on a 1% decline.\n\nThere will be lots of evictions, but the only thing that seems to affect is rental income and paying mortgage.  If the Fed is going to keep the banks from failing, it doesn’t seem like evictions really makes a difference in the stock market.  The only thing it might affect is spending since the landlords will have less income, but even then, landlords can defer their mortgage payments for 6 months.\n\nMultiple vaccines (Fauci and Oxford in the news recently) seem to have great results and are expanding trials in the fall.

What kind of information are you thinking about that doesn’t align with what Dr. Fauci is saying about having a vaccine soon?  I copied his quotes here:\n\n> Fauci says he's \"cautiously optimistic\" a good vaccine will be available soon.\n\n> \"I don't really see us eradicating it.

If you look at equity valautions they are historically expensive and people justify this with \"zero rates.\" Which itself is a retarded statement because rates are not zero. They are a number above zero because consumers and businesses don't get zero rate loans.\n\nAs for Faucci, nothing he said there was a fact. They were just feelings. If you investigated the history of vaccines you would understand that a March timeline is very optimistic. Experts, if they are being honest, would say we are probably years away from a vaccine. The only thing that gives people hope are the stakes, the level of focus on it, and new technology that's being leveraged for vaccine development.\n\nIf you want to hear an expert talk about equity valuations:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/JowcZ_yUPW4", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Usually a vaccine takes years, but have you seen the vaccine tracker?

{"title": "Raytheon Technologies: The Misunderstood Dark Horse of the DJIA", "selftext": "First post here. I hope you enjoy it! \n\nBottom Line Up Front: Raytheon Technologies reports earnings early next week and may be positioned for a big, big win in both the short term and long term. \n\n*Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of any agency of the U.S. government. Assumptions made within the analysis are not reflective of the position of any U.S. government entity. I am long RTX, and an active duty service member.*\n\nRaytheon Corp. is a storied organization to United States Department of Defense (DoD) service members that work closely with missiles and radar systems. Sensors and missiles are a critical element of the United States military portfolio and require modernization as United States military training strategy shifts from a counter-insurgency focus to a conventional warfare focus. Unmanned aerial systems (UAS), modern cruise missiles (CMs), and evolving tactical ballistic missile (TBM) threats make updating antiquated systems and acquiring new technology an immediate priority. Raytheon is positioned to provide these emerging technologies to the DoD, and I will discuss these upcoming projects throughout the article. \n\nWhy, then, is Raytheon a dark horse amongst other major defense companies? \n\nThe first point I want to emphasize is the DoD transition to Large-Scale Combat Operations (LSCO) as a military strategy focus as they transition away from an emphasis on Counter-Insurgency (COIN) operations. LSCO requires effective multi-domain operations (MDO), which means effective and integrated strategies regarding land, sea, air, space, and cyberspace. To have effective MDO, the DoD is seeking systems that both expand capabilities against peer threats and increase ability to track enemy units and communicate internally. Clearly this suggests a modernizing military strategy that relies heavily on air, missile, and sensor modernization. For this reason, I believe that increased China tensions are a boon to the defense industry, especially the missiles and space industry. \n\nUnited Technologies and Raytheon conducted a merger of equals on 03APR20. This moved Raytheon Corp. to the DJIA as a replacement for UTC. Despite both companies having strong reputations in their respective sectors prior to their merger, United Technologies' exposure to the commercial aerospace sector has been the defining narrative for the RTX valuation. The COVID-19 impact on the commercial aerospace sector is an undeniable a factor, but it is not the X-factor when considering Raytheon's valuation. In the May earnings report, Raytheon Corporation was not yet included in the quarterly financial discussion and, thus, did not have a significant impact on the topline numbers that were discussed during the call. \n\nSee the attached image for a quick comparison of RTX to competitors since the merger. Additionally, an image is provided to show commercial vs defense exposure in Q1. Bear in mind that last quarter's conference call suggested significant cost cutting measures on the commerical aerospace side of the business. The company has played a role in PPE production for COVID19 and has done a great job building long-term favor with partners in industry. In anticipation of the 28JUL20 earnings, this article examines all organizations under the RTX umbrella and assesses COVID-19's impact on their bottom-line. This analysis will show that an over-emphasis on United Technologies portfolio has created a tremendous buying opportunity for RTX. \n\n**Collins Aerospace ($6.4bil Sales, $1.1bil Profit)**\n\nCollins Aerospace is vulnerable to COVID related impacts on the commercial aerospace industry. Their primary focus centers around avionics, interiors, and mechanical systems of commercial aircraft, but they do have 25% exposure to defense projects that are unlikely impacted by COVID. Despite these challenges, Collins Aerospace has done a great job building a positive reputation by 3D printing face shields and distributing large amounts of PPE to the medical world. It is also worth noting that the business aviation sector is heavily impacted, and they have a wide exposure to high-end business aviation. Collins Aerospace is involved in the ever-popular space trend, and is producing subsystems for the NASA Orion spacecraft. This $320mil contract is great, but it is also worth noting that successful exposure to the space exploration side of the business translates easily into luxury interior design side of the business. I understand that this is a wild prediction, and several years out, but it is nice to see Collins Aerospace staying competitive in an emerging, high visibility segment. \n\n**Pratt & Whitney ($5.35bil Sales, $439mil Profit)**\n\nPratt & Whitney is in the business of engines. Production volumes are likely to be hit hard on the commercial side, but I anticipate their defense sector to be unphased. They produce the F135 for the F35, and Lockheed Martin announced during their call that Taiwan was looking to increase their order of F35s. China posturing in India has made a lot of SE Asian countries wake up to potential threats, and defensive air superiority is a relatively inexpensive way to build combat power. I don’t think that Pratt & Whitney will have a strong quarter, but I also don’t think that it will be a world-shatteringly bad quarter. \n\n**Raytheon Intelligence & Space ($3.6bil Sales, $379mil Profit)**\n\nI think that non-military service members hear ‘space’ regarding military combat power and do not fully appreciate the role that space assets serve in MDO. Anti-jamming GPS, early warning data for missile defense capabilities, and beyond-line-of-site communication and internet connections are some of key assets that are enabled through space technology. This is absolutely in demand. The creation of a space force may be a storm-trooper like marine force in future centuries, but for now the priority is leveraging space assets to enable forces on earth. As future military budgets include the Space Force in their budget allocation, I think it is reasonable to project that DoD space spend proportionally increases as senior military leaders duke it out on capital hill for budget distribution. Both military service members and contracting developers continue to execute acquisition timelines regardless of COVID and I do not foresee a material impact on RIS’s topline numbers. \n\n**Raytheon Missiles & Defense ($3.85bil Sales, $573mil Profit)**\n\nThe Patriot Radar has been the bread and butter of the RMD portfolio for years, and despite continued foreign military sales (FMS) of the Patriot system to several countries in both the Middle East and Europe, the DoD has signaled it’s desire to modernize by awarding RMD the Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense Sensor contract. This radar will phase out the legacy Patriot radar, and, if successful, could result in the sale of 70+ radars worldwide. An extremely conservative estimate of $200mil per radar would mean a successful LTAMDS project could result in $14bil of radar orders alone. Modernization, maintenance, and training costs would continue over the life of the project. \n\nPresident Trump has become a fan of the “super-duper missile” in recent months. This project is a response to the Russian Avengarde hypersonic glide vehicle project. Bottom line, missiles that fly at hypersonic speeds and fly low to the ground are extremely difficult to detect and engage before impact. This both reemphasizes the importance of the RMD portfolio, and suggests that the United States needs this capability themselves to maintain competition. The initial contracts awarded by the DoD are simply to fund the R&D side of the project, and the real bottom-line will be materially realized when the project is successful and purchased in the USAF budget. It is great to see this company leading the way on such high profile defense projects, though. \n\nRMD is also working on Counter-UAS sensor and engagement solutions. This is a clear priority for military, as the cost proposition for engaging enemy surveillance and / or armed drones is not a good one. \n\n**Headwinds** \n\nCommercial Aerospace exposure\n\nSlowing production due to COVID19\n\nSignificant competition in the sector (LMT, NOC, BA, etc) \n\n**Tailwinds**\n\nLTAMDS / Hypersonic Glide Vehicle\n\nForeign Military sales of legacy AMD systems\n\nF35 exposure\n\nSpace Limelight\n\nChina Tensions b/w US and regional countries\n\nAny Boeing progress on 737 Max is good news \n\nGreat LMT call boosting defense sector Q2 outlook\n\nDoD spending shift toward programs that coincide w/ RTX porfolio\n\n**Sources**:\n\n[https://investors.rtx.com/static-files/c7f13250-6edc-4134-8b03-e66a64c25708](https://investors.rtx.com/static-files/c7f13250-6edc-4134-8b03-e66a64c25708)\n\n[https://investors.rtx.com/static-files/b8b8dbb2-6bf1-4ad7-b34d-c705ef069a00](https://investors.rtx.com/static-files/b8b8dbb2-6bf1-4ad7-b34d-c705ef069a00)\n\n[http://investor.raytheon.com/static-files/1dfcab5a-9c2b-40ea-aeeb-56eb7a67d21b](http://investor.raytheon.com/static-files/1dfcab5a-9c2b-40ea-aeeb-56eb7a67d21b)\n\n[https://investors.rtx.com/events-and-presentations](https://investors.rtx.com/events-and-presentations)\n\n[https://www.tradoc.army.mil/Portals/14/Documents/MDO/TP525-3-1\\_30Nov2018.pdf](https://www.tradoc.army.mil/Portals/14/Documents/MDO/TP525-3-1_30Nov2018.pdf)\n\n[https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Collins\\_Aerospace\\_to\\_supply\\_critical\\_subsystems\\_for\\_NASAs\\_Orion\\_spacecraft\\_999.html](https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Collins_Aerospace_to_supply_critical_subsystems_for_NASAs_Orion_spacecraft_999.html)\n\n[https://www.collinsaerospace.com/-/media/project/collinsaerospace/collinsaerospace-website/newsroom/files/collins\\_aerospace\\_fact-sheet.pdf?rev=11b5a89fccd544e4bf12e0af67ef38b0&hash=CA309369D28FA1427C9BE15F09715ECA](https://www.collinsaerospace.com/-/media/project/collinsaerospace/collinsaerospace-website/newsroom/files/collins_aerospace_fact-sheet.pdf?rev=11b5a89fccd544e4bf12e0af67ef38b0&hash=CA309369D28FA1427C9BE15F09715ECA)\n\n[http://investor.raytheon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/raytheon-wins-633-million-darpa-contract-hypersonic-weapons-work](http://investor.raytheon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/raytheon-wins-633-million-darpa-contract-hypersonic-weapons-work)\n\n[https://www.raytheon.com/news/feature/fast-and-furious](https://www.raytheon.com/news/feature/fast-and-furious)", "id": "hx5nxp", "created_utc": 1595610528.0, "score": 108, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 83, "comments": [{"body": "This is above my reading levels.

Also, thank you for the DD. I can't recall reading a more thorough DD here in a while. I bought a few of the Jul 31 63c contracts. I don't normally do options plays for earnings given how wacky the market has been lately but I believe that since Raytheon has not seen a run up in its share price leading into earnings, an earnings beat will actually make the stock go up unlike other stocks. \n\nOne question for you: aside from the revenue you forecast being derived from the strategy shift from COIN to LSCO, do you believe that the launch of the Space Force will also lead to increased revenue for Raytheon? I know much of the Space Force was created by combining space-related assets and personnel from other branches, but even though they do not have their own budget as of yet, do you think that the integration of the assets, the launching of new projects, or anything else led to additional revenue?\n\nP.S.
