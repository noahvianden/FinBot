That's not part of your job description and your clients aren't wanting that from you.  Your only job is to make their money do what the s&p does.

However, it cannot sustain this price level for very long due to lack of demand at $1500.  Inclusion then officially occurs, and index funds step in to buy.  They perfectly fill the gap of buyers needed to sustain the $1500 price.
