{"title": "PTON - Potential to Be the Next Big Company", "selftext": "Peloton is going to the moon and here's why:\n\n1. Peloton, for the first time in it's history of being a public company, is expected to post a profit of $55M to $65M. For a company that is growing 70% YoY, expected to hit 1M subscribers with \\~60% gross margins on their subscription product, this is incredible. We all know how much Wall Street loves profitability. \n\n2. June traffic YoY has essentially DOUBLED. Monthly uniques will prob land somewhere b/w 2M-3M monthly unique visitors. June 2019 they were b/w 500K-1M monthly unique visitors (see below).\n\nWhen looking at last year's numbers during the same time period, they posted $223M in revenue. This quarter they are expected to post $520M, which I believe is a very conservative estimate. For reference, they posted \\~$525M LAST quarter, so they are expecting numbers to essentially be flat this quarter, which I find strange and clear sand-bagging (subscribers have grown exponentially and demand is still through the roof). Their YoY growth for this quarter will be minimum 100% growth, and likely be closer to 200% YoY revenue growth (!). \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0yroa0hib6951.png?width=816&format=png&auto=webp&s=132cc9d6592630e66a07a55558bbef12cbb14887\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. Please take into consideration, how many subscribers 1M subscribers actually is. Right now, they have 850K \"Connected Fitness Subscribers\" and 150K \"Digital Subscribers.\" Let's just say all are paying customers (no free trials, little churn etc) that's around $34M (850K x $40) in Connected Fitness Subscriber Revenue and $2.1M (150K x $14) in revenue for digital subscribers per month. That's almost $500M in annual subscription revenue at 60%+ gross margins alone assuming absolutely no growth in their subscription numbers. Not only is $500M in annual subscription revenue impressive, they have over a 97% retention rate (which is unheard of). \n\n5. International Expansion. Peloton, rightfully so, is reinvesting much of their cash and profits into expensive ventures getting into costly legal battles (i.e. Flywheel) with competitors that are infringing on their copyright/technology. However, a lot of their spend is going and will be going towards international expansion. Think Netflix pre-international spike and what that did to their numbers. In the UK and Germany (the next two biggest markets), they barely have a presence. The at-home fitness will only grow, and this is going to be huge for the future growth. \n\n6.  I view the at-home fitness movement as one of the key trends that has the potential to be game-changing. If you think about the trends in the market that have the potential to return your money 10x, I would bet on gaming, computer chips, gambling (maybe), AI, self-driving, and at-home fitness. Even if you believe there is no trend and people will go to the gym, it's undeniable the impact of COVID and how much liberal tech elites love this product. The wealthy will be the least affected by the pandemic, and guess what, their target market is the liberal elite/wealthy (most scared of COVID, and will always spend $ no matter what on expensive luxury items like a TESLA or PELOTON). \n\nAt absolute worst case scenario, I see this company at a \\~$50 stock price (which is essentially 2x from where they were pre-covid). Their business has easily doubled since then, and if you are a forever pessimist and expect zero or negative growth (unlikely), then the stock drops maybe \\~20%. The risk-reward here for me is undeniable. This has the potential to be a $100+ stock by the end of the year and definitely by 2021 with the potential to even have $SHOP or $TSLA like gains if the at-home fitness trend is here to stay. If it's not, then at worst you own a stock in a company that has over 1M subscribers, a rabid community/fan base, and a product that people love (like TESLA) with high NPS scores (70+) with a price around \\~$50.\n\nIn the end, I never try and short or doubt a company where customers are absolutely in love with the product. This is the case with Peloton, with incredible tailwinds because of COVID and economies of scale with their growing subscriber base, ability to gain manufacturing scale, and also best in class talent (fitness instructors).\n\nTLDR: At home fitness is early days of the trend, subscriber numbers doubling YoY with 95%+ retention, NPS scores on par with Apple and Disney, and potential for international expansion with an already profitable business growing 60% YoY. $100 by EOY.", "id": "hm22dp", "created_utc": 1594015050.0, "score": 69, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 81, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 22, "replies": [{"body": "No calls :).

Still feeling bready after this solid DD / [brevidence](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hl4ymp/bread_has_been_empty_for_the_last_two_weeks_at/)\n\nThis is an 7/16 earnings play (SEE EDIT 2 AT BOTTOM). Now is time to early MSFT 220c 7/17, with goal to sell most contracts 7/16 once IV fomo is maxed out. Hold a pair to see how the market reacts as high erogenous risk.\n\nOkay, MSFT used to be a boring-ass tech company. Then something happened back in 2014, Ballmer the Boomer stepped down to [buy a shitty](https://ftw.usatoday.com/2014/08/steve-ballmer-2-billion-clippers) sports team and my man [Satya Nutella](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satya_Nadella) took over and has since spread his chocolatey goodness and rich hazelnut flavor across the nutty tech world. Competition is getting toasty, and MSFT is likely to beat earnings in the oven with strong future guidance. \n\nThe seasoning:\n\n* MS Teams performance is going to be a big deal, as it's [bundled with Office 365](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-teams-now-microsoft-reveals-when-you-can-expect-to-see-49-people-on-screen/) and fully integrated-- mid and large cap companies looking to strengthen work from home muscles would go with this since they likely already pay for it and trust boring MSFT over haute slack, etc.\n\n* [Azure is a growth market](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2020/07/06/how-microsoft-created-800-billion-in-3-years--can-it-repeat/#1fa6e54c7dd1) during all this, plenty of room for cloud growth in lots of sectors, including government and education, where MSFT holds many, many long-term or no limit contracts\n\n* Last earnings call MSFT said they [saw \"minimal\" impact](https://www.barrons.com/articles/microsoft-stock-rises-after-company-says-covid-19-had-minimal-impact-on-fiscal-third-quarter-earnings-51588193445) due to COVID--and as far as I can tell this is a company basically custom built for a stay-at-home pandemic\n\n* Xbox is a big deal, and the Gamepass streaming tech is getting a major invest, already way [outperforming Sony 5x](https://www.businessinsider.com/xbox-game-pass-is-much-bigger-than-playstation-now-2020-5) with many tier 1 titles and early access, etc., also the FB partnership is important for growth\n\n* Salesforce brought the CRM battle home to Seattle with the purchase of Tableau, and MSFT has been [steadily facelifting](https://msdynamicsworld.com/story/microsoft-launches-preview-dynamics-365-project-operations-how-we-got-here) Dynamics, which it sells to enterprise and gov't customers for a huge premium, sometimes bundling with Power BI\n\n* And the company still puts [emphasis on B2C](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2020/07/01/introducing-new-onedrive-features-to-share-and-collaborate-across-work-and-life/), because you can still buy individual \"ownership\" licenses of products like Windows and Office, instead of SaaS only, demonstrating market flexibility to maximize profits\n\n* Moat only getting dug deeper through lots of [cross-platform integration](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/microsoft-teams-and-skype-users-can-now-chat-together/) and product bundling (e.g. I can now see *all* my software including xbox from one account)\n\n* Also, I like that MSFT takes 2-4 year risks, and then gets out if it doesn't go well--they're [closing the retail stores](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/techburger/article/R-I-P-Microsoft-Stores-We-hardly-knew-ye-And-15377633.php) they'd opened, which I think is smart baking\n\nThe image of MSFT is improving--a lot of the toxic culture stuff has been going away since the invention of Nutella and the stock has been rising steadily now that the market has taken notice. They're able to attract more talent, and they have restructured their leadership.\n\nMy positions: MSFT 220c 7/17, MSFT 215c 9/18. I'll admit I also want to buy stock.
