So much BS in here. I'll highlight your 'analysis' of the P1 data. News flash, a mild or moderate fever after getting a vaccine is very common, and indicates that your body is mounting an immune response to the antigen; i.e. it indicates that the vaccine is working. None of the patients in 100 ug dose cohort experienced severe fever, and overall the safety profile for that dose looks very good. There has been no pushback from FDA or NIH on Moderna's clinical testing timeline due to this data. These kinds of posts always seem to leave out that 100% of the 100 ug cohort produced neutralizing antibodies, all of which had titres well above the median titres from convalescent plasma. This is an indication of 100% efficacy (admittedly this may not equate to 100% disease prevention but neutralizing antibody titres are arguably the best available metric if disease prevention is not assessed), which is a very significant achievement in any clinical study.\n\nThe study design critique is also laughable. Moderna has been working hand-in-hand with NIH and FDA for not only development support but also on clinical study design. The phase 3 study will be conducted almost exactly how FDA wants it. (This also goes for the other companies pursuing vaccines, because they are also working closely with NIH/FDA).\n\nOn the topic of insider selling, I don't disagree with you that it seems shady. I only partially buy Bancel's argument that it is all standard, pre-planned selling in a locked-in schedule. I wouldn't be surprised if they timed some of their press releases to make those stock sales more favorable. But the thing is, it is possible for a pharma company to have greedy execs and also bring safe/effective products to market. It might be news to you, but it is actually quite common that pharma execs are greedy and do shady things.\n\nYour manufacturing comment is poorly researched, MRNA has had contracts secured with large CMO's for months now to achieve the manufacturing volume that they are reporting.\n\nOne last note, regarding the apparent difference in the drug substance doses for Moderna/BioNTech: what ultimately matters is for the dose that you use, can you achieve a high rate of sufficient efficacy and safety? I.e. if Moderna's dose is just as (or more) effective and just as (or more) safe as the dose that BioNTech selects, the difference really doesn't matter from a therapeutic standpoint.\n\nI have exposure to MRNA and PFE.
