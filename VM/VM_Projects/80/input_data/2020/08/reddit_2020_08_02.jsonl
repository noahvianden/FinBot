{"title": "Unusual Options Activity in HSBC, WORK, RCII, VXX with uptick in activity in JPM/MS", "selftext": "What’s good on the weekend my fellow autists and degenerates?. Swaggy, the options savant, brings you some unusual option flow from the week. I'll preface today's post by saying that the spreads on these stocks probably aren't great and most likely are \"risky\" plays. So do your own due diligence if you decide to jump in.\n\nIf you want to understand more about option flow, I made [this post on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/SwaggyStocks/comments/i2cwm1/unusual_options_activity_option_flow_what_it_is/) to go through some of the basics of how to look at flow. Next week I'll go in detail on how to incorporate different strategies into your trading.\n\n**RCII – Rent-A-Center**\n\nSpotted some unusual option flow in Rent-A-Center in December 18 CALLs. Player purchased 1,500 CALLs at the $40 strike (33% OTM), stock currently $29.00. Bet size was about $85k and the player is expecting a huge jump in stock price by the end of the year. RCII reports earnings next week August 5th. The strike price was the highest strike price currently available on the option chain and the volume of that trade was about 33% of total open interest for every single option chain available for that stock.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9hlqcl27ple51.png?width=2228&format=png&auto=webp&s=647bd68284306fae782f8afc546e3a1435ea5cb1\n\n**HSBC – HSBC Holdings**\n\nHSBC saw some bullish flow with next week’s expiring (Aug 7) calls. A player purchased over 8,000 CALLs at the $23 strike for a premium of $365k. Pretty big bet for a position expiring next week. Of note, HSBC is currently near 52-week low and they report earnings Monday.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hyju02slple51.png?width=2248&format=png&auto=webp&s=344a6b37e838fe63b41826983587937ebe266ff3\n\n**WORK – Slack Technologies**\n\nI saw some bullish flow roll through WORK last week. Most of it was PUT selling with an expiration in the fall or next year. There was also one interesting position opened that was interesting. A player opened a synthetic long position, which is similar risk to buying shares outright. The play was: 1. Bought to open 15,000 Sept-18 CALLs at $30 strike and 2. Sold to open 15,000 Sept-18 PUTs at $30 strike. Essentially they collect $1.3 million in premium to go long on the stock as long as it stays above $30 by September 18. If the stock closes below $30 they will be assigned over 1,500,000 shares. Of course, they can sell anytime before then, but they are pretty bullish on the stock with this position. Of note, Slack has been hammered in recent weeks due to the increase of competition to their main platform.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/68j94a8nple51.png?width=2390&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d70bc373e72c6c5edf94fa7b3c753603460eb0c\n\n**MS & JPM – Morgan Stanley & JPM**\n\nI’ll categorize these two guys together. Banks have been getting the smack-down over the last several months. Most saw a bit of uptick in call activity coming through last week. Nothing spectacular here, but good to notice an increase in bullish flow as we have recently been starting to see some rotation out of tech. Banks could be due for some positive news, most are near the lows.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9kuaz3vople51.jpg?width=3264&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c13e3aa4858c1c4b7fe223214f96ffa29fef5b78\n\n**VXX – VIX Short-Term Futures**\n\nFollowing up from last week, players are still betting on a decrease in volatility for the short-term after next week. Analyzing some of the plays, it looks like players are expecting the VXX stay in the range between $23 and $27, $currently $29. VXX going down means volatility dropping, which typically is bullish for the market.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fuqqjbxrple51.png?width=2998&format=png&auto=webp&s=b041636edaa2b74fdbaae027544e45a7e3457a15", "id": "i2d7yz", "created_utc": 1596379674.0, "score": 319, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 87, "comments": [{"body": "The first 2 big calls you mentioned sound very interesting.

If they are, that's a lot of money to be throwing around on a hunch!\n\n3. Do you plan on opening any positions on any of these?", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "1. I don't use absolute order flow as that data is thousands $$ per month and I actually wouldn't be able to log various other metrics that I currently am. My algo currently scans real-time options chains and logs about 5/6 metrics with the change in volume. The main metric is always going to be the skew on the option price compared to the bid/ask, but there are other metrics like IV and greeks you can use if you are tracking it very closely and many many times throughout the day.\n\n2. The activity I've mentioned in my posts have been quite spot on. I'm not sure if that's just plain luck or not. Typically the ones I post about are more \"strategic\" plays I've come across instead of just seeing players hammer high volume in call buying. I think I have a decent mix of both. As for the players making these YOLOs it could be anyone. Could be a cowboy YOLO-ing away, could be smart-money that has good info on a particular stock, could be a big fund or institution. I like breaking down the trades and trying to figure out why they would enter the position, if I can. I come across too many \"stock-pickers\" on FinTwit that boast about how they spotted insane unusual trades and if you \"followed\" them into the trade you woulda made 1,000%. A good example was Friday morning when there was actually high volume in AAPL calls with 0 DTE with $420 strike price. Those calls ended up doing like 1,500% because of how the stock mooned.. But think about it, they picked a 5% OTM strike price expiring in a few hours. Anyone blindly following that trade is going to lose all their money 99.9% of the time. \n\n3. Like I mentioned at the top of the post, these stocks mentioned are relatively high risk because the spread will be wide, but that's also what makes them unusual. I am going to write a post about the strategy behind making plays following UOA. Normally if you are jumping into a play after millions of dollars in calls has been bought you will be left holding the bag. The reason for that is because generally with such high volume in options the stock is also going to rise. There are times though, if you can get in early that there is much better reward to risk. For these plays specifically, the stock hasn't risen much and the play has gone \"under the radar\" so to speak.", "score": 19, "replies": [{"body": "Yea I guess thats part of the problem, you really don't know if its smart money or gamblers.

{"title": "NIO monthly delivery - Be ready to pump.", "selftext": "# It's a new month, time for another round of NIO pumping.\n\nNIO will be revealing their delivering report for July. As per last few months, NIO tend to do this on the first Wed/Thurs of a new month, so my estimated date of pump will be Aug 6... Then again, things may change, so I'll be in on Monday open\n\n\\----\n\n# NIO pump takes days.\n\nNIO isn't like most penny stocks, the pump takes days, so at least 14 DTE, preferably more.\n\n* Price on July 1, is below $8, and it peaked at July 10 near $15.\n* Price on June 1, is $4.30, and it peaked at June 9 for $6.7.\n\nIf you don't have patience or can't count past 7, this is not for you. I know the criteria invalidates 99% of you retards, but that's my perspective of \"how life works\"; Get your wife's boyfriend to help if needed.\n\n\\---\n\n# Why is there a pump?\n\nBecause NIO will most likely do better than expectation. Here are some numbers.\n\n>Apr 2020: 3,155May 2020: 3,436June 2020: 3,740\n\nDelivery numbers went up by around 300 per month, so  we can assume market expectation to be around 4050 for July. Now, if NIO delivers around 4050, it meets expectations = price rise due to constant high growth.\n\nIf NIO delivers more, it exceeds expectations = price rise even more.\n\n\\---\n\n# So, how many EV did NIO deliver in July?\n\nOn July 18, NIO officially stated that the 50,000th NIO production car was officially off the assembly line. Yes, they build their 50,000 EV on July 18.\n\nUnlike other car makers, NIO outsourced its manufacturing... meaning, that'll most likely be \"order on demand\". Building their 50,000 EV means they have 50,000 sales.\n\nTill June 2020, NIO did a total delivery of 46,082 EVs; That's a balance of nearly 4000 EVs left for July. NIO is almost at the \"expectation mark\" on July 18th. With nearly half a month remaining, chances of exceeding expectations is **huge**.\n\n\\---\n\n# Priced in?\n\nWell, NIO news isn't obscured. Everyone who knows how to find can find the information. However, do understand that NIO's current price is suppose to be at $13. The reason it's trading lower: someone from Goldman Sachs downgraded NIO with a price target of $7.\n\nThis is good in a way because current price has more upwards potential. In addition, most people in the knows, will reverse the BS from GS... I think this is the likely time for the reversal.\n\nBy meeting expectation's, I'm expecting NIO to hit higher 13s, while exceeding can elevates it back to ATH or even more, depending on how much it exceeds. Hypothetically speaking, if NIO can deliver over 5,000 in July, breaking $20 is possible.\n\nHowever, there's always the possibility of another analyst, jumping out with one of those \"underweight\" review; for those not holding long term, expect a dump after the pump.\n\n\\---\n\n# TL/DR:\n\nNIO 8/14 13c\n\nNIO 8/21 14c", "id": "i2mibg", "created_utc": 1596412304.0, "score": 164, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 90, "comments": [{"body": "8/28 27$c hold my beer", "score": 94, "replies": [{"body": "🤣", "score": 7, "replies": []}, {"body": "🤭", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Same cuz", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "ive been holding this boy forever \n\ni think i have 100 shares too", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "LETS FUCKING GO 🍻", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "This is solid DD actually.
