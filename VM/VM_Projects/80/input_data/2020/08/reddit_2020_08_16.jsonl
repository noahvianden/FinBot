Compare that to other brands that just do not have that same crossover appeal and market penetration. Shoes + clothing gives them such a range to access the retail markets.\n2. Brand visibility. The swoosh is synonymous with american athletics, and now streetwear. Athletes and streetwear enthusiasts alike love their products, and athleisure as a category is huge (just look at LULU growth)\n3. Beckys love Nike, and Beckys pump sales.\n4. Customizable apparel. Nike's website has allowed people to create custom shoes for years. Do you want mustard yellow and turquoise SBs? Got it. Want some Quicksilver/periwinkle Jordans? We got em. Their ability to adapt their business to online retail sales compared to others is almost unparalleled.\n5. China. Streetwear in China and a lot of south east asia is booooooooming.
