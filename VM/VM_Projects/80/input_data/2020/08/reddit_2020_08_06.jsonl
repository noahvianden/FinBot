Capital outlay for a play like this is crazy. We would probably go buy TSLA $2000c and then go eat at red lobster instead. 2. Closing the position. The market for $105c has to be pretty slim. You may think your call is valuable, but you won't know how much until you adjust the price down a few times to actually sell it.
