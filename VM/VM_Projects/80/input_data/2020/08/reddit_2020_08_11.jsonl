{"title": "NIO beats earnings estimate! UP 10% Pre Market", "selftext": "Alright you big red dildo smoking autists, here are some key metrics from NIO's Q2 results:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQ2 2020\n\n**Vehicle sales at 493 M up 139% YoY**... Don't stop baby just a little more\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**General Expenses 131M down 18% YoY**...Holy fuck they've managed to cut their general expenses significantly\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EBIDTA -164M Up from -470M in Q2 2019**... Thats a big fucking deal. Im so hard.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Net Loss 167M vs Net Loss of 479M in Q2 2019**...Keep going faster, harder\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Revenue growth of 139% YoY**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Net Income Growth of 65% YoY**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Gross Profit YoY up a whopping 160% (from -73M to + 44M)**... Key metric many people are looking at. This is the first improvement in their gross profit since 2018. Getting harder.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EPS is -0.16 vs analysts estimate of -0.24**... Im fucking cumming.\n\n.....................\n\nBiggest improvement so far in any quarter for NIO. **Earnings estimate beat by 30%**.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTheir vehicle deliveries were 10,331 vs 3,823 last quarter!. Q2 2019 they had 3,553 vehicle deliveries. Thats roughly an average of 283% more deliveries. Coupled with their guidance of 11k-15k vehicle deliveries for Q3 of this year I think NIO is the underdog that not enough people have noticed yet so now may be your chance to hop on the tendie train early.\n\nTrading is up 10% pre-market, whatever happens I'm bullish on NIO. With this kind of growth I expect this to be the next (Chinese) Tesla. (Who actually have sales and make money) If you want to switch your red dildos to green dildos buy calls.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI bought mine last week, whatever happens I'm diamond hands\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSept 18 26C and LEAPS\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*\\[Forgot to add, do your own DD motherfuckers we're all retards at best\\]*", "id": "i7q1g9", "created_utc": 1597145029.0, "score": 86, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 82, "comments": [{"body": "IV 134%, dont you think it will crush fuck face ?

How does a company benefit from exaggerating numbers? It will excited investors, the stock price will go up, and then insiders can avail of this \"pump\" with a good old fashioned \"dump\".

Considering they have sold 50,000 cars, which are very real, and very very high quality, Nio is a very expensive pump and dump adventure compared to a coffee company. And if you wanna dispute those 50k sales... It's a bit harder to fake sales of premium electric vehicles than cappuccinos.\n\nSo if we rule out Nio being a fundementaly fraudulent, pump n dump company, there's only one other explanation: they want more money from investors. But the money Nio gets from us Robinhood investors is peanuts, and they already have MASSIVE backing from Tencent and a few big American funds. \n\nSo all in all, why would they fake numbers? It's the risk to reward ratio makes zero sense from Nio's perspective.\n\nI'm open to correction or challenging on these points", "score": 4, "replies": []}, {"body": "We don‚Äôt, which is why I qualified my comment with ‚Äúbe skeptical of any Chinese company.‚Äù That said, when the CCP announced they‚Äôd taken a stake in it, that makes me feel more comfortable that eventually it will become profitable, regardless of how long it takes.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "TSLA is the Luckin of TSLA", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Found the CCP guy", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Yes", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "rip all call holders", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Yeah but NIO is still worst constructor in FormulaE, PASS", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "This didnt age well", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I sold (16) Aug 14 15$ c against my shares.
