That normally means it's a solid price that will hold for a while.\n\nIt's basically, look for when the 2DTE 4$ OTM (spy at 330, it's the 326) put hits .60-.70, it's a good deal (sometimes I go in at .80 depending on how spy has been that day). It will range from .60-1.20 depending on volatility. Box 1 is checked (the put is at the daily low), I start buying in and watching TLT to affirm that my \"today's low\" buy in price is a good one.\n\nWhen tlt starts moving up, I buy in more. Normally have a 3$ range that I'll go before cutting off (start at .60, stop buying at .63). Track spy/tlt, the news for why it may be dropping and start selling off at 10$ profit. On a small dip (has like 30 in a day) making 10$ a contract is easy money. Medium dips net 30-40$ each, big 60-70 and massive can make 200-300 a contract.\n\nIf it's a bad play, I probably get out in 2 min and wait to time the next reversal.

You use $70 here, but .60-.70 in the paragraph following. I'm guessing you're just interchanging the price of a contract for an individual share and the price for 100.

Obviously the low at 9:31 is going to be a lot different than the low at 1:30 but you get the idea, buy low - sell high. Looking at the sales of the day gives you an idea that you're not buying in at the high.\n\nI haven't reversed it, I like how liquid SPY is and they never range over .01$ between bid/ask. I wouldn't play both at the same time because 5 seconds can be the difference between making 500$ or 50$, volatility (how quickly it drops) jacks up prices and makes the profit.\n\nThis isn't my main money maker, it's just something I like to do for fun a few times a day. \n\n- random guy on the internet disclaimer, do not follow what I do and this is not advice.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "I was debating getting in today with a similar play but unfortunately decided to sit out.

With the Fed buying so much of the float, it was getting harder to find good collateral to lend which indirectly caused the liquidity issues.  The new bank regs require banks to horde a certain amount of tier 1 capital which limits their ability to take on additional risk.\n\nIt would explain why the Treasury is issuing more paper than it even needs to while the Fed is buying on the other end.  They are trying to force market flow thru the system and keep the works from clogging up.  Sort of like a power wash.\n\nPeople think that the executive is holding the cash to dump into the markets before the election, but without clear instructions from congress the legality of his executive orders is tentative at best.  I think instead that the Treasury is trying to provide sufficient collateral to markets in order to ensure that credit markets continue to work.  And to create a base market with the Fed to put a floor and ceiling on the bid/ask.\n\nWe are basically creating bank reserves to turn into cash at the TGA that goes nowhere.  This doesn't solve the underlying issues though because the cash in the TGA is debt that has to be repaid or defaulted on.  It is deflationary in nature unless it goes out into the world to purchase goods and services.\n\nAnd only Congress can push that cash into markets and actually affect fiscal stimulus.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Is the treasury really just hoarding that cash?  The June deficit was $896B IIRC (for the month, not annualized).  \nOne part of your theory I don't get is why the Fed would buy up the bonds and defeat the Treasury's goal of supplying more collateral to the market.  Wouldn't they be coordinating with each other?\nI've heard that theory on collateral shortage causing the repo problem.  But the problem was that repo rates spiked - that would suggest a shortage of cash available to lend in the repo market, not a shortage of demand (and if they don't have the collateral needed, they're not in the market so they don't affect the price).  But I may be totally missing something there, I haven't done a deep dive on that stuff.\nMy theory on the repo thing was that banks made more profit by putting their money in long term stuff.  When repo rates went to 10% that was the market trying to entice them to sell some long term stuff and finance the repo market.  But the Fed intervened instead.

His thesis is that the banks have an incentive to get more QE by making the dollar stronger. Banks have already tightened their lending and are reducing the quarterly M2 flow is showing this too. Once the Fed steps in again, TLT is going to be short squeezed, just like in 2008. This will also cause interest rates to drop and the banks will be more willing to lend again.
