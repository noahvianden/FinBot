{"title": "A lot of gamma expiring today, will volatility follow?", "selftext": "Nomura analyst Charlie McElligott put out a note earlier this week on the gamma expiring this week and whether market volatility will free up afterwards: \n\n>\"SPX / SPY options $Delta remains historically  very high at 94th percentile (since 2013) and with QQQ $Delta even more  “extreme” over 97th percentile, which could now matter given that this  week’s expiration should see a TON of Gamma rolling-off—meaning that as  Dealer $Gamma hedging requirements are set to drop precipitously (with  so much coming-off after Friday’s expiration) that we could see a  powerful “unclenching” and thus, potential for a much larger trading  distribution thereafter\"\n\nTo quickly explain gamma's effect on the overall market, imagine two soccers goalie on opposite ends of the field, knocking the ball back towards the midfield line, while coming in towards midfield by the end of the game (with increasing speed as the game was about to end).\n\nThat's what happening behind the scenes of the market. Dealer/market makers (who trade delta neutral) are loaded up with a lot of gamma (long calls and puts) into this expiration. As the market goes higher, they have shares to sell. As the market goes lower, they have shares to buy. That's one  big reason for the lack of volatility in the broader markets the past 2  weeks and why its moves seem to be getting more and more narrow. Here's  the SPY expected move chart for the next 2 months via Options AI  technology:\n\n[*SPY expected move chart*](https://www.optionseye.com/content/images/2020/08/2020-08-20-12-49-24.2020-08-20-12_50_39.gif)\n\nOptions have compressed to the point where the expected move over the next month in SPY is only \\~3.5%. And the expected move into the end of  August just \\~1.7%.\n\nThat is not atypical following periods of elevated volatility. As the VIX comes in from elevated levels like we saw this Spring and Summer, panic selling of options can ensue and many trading books get overloaded with gamma. (Trust me, I was a market maker. After the VIX is 80 and now 20, and you've been getting long vol/gamma since 30... 20 can feel like the end of the world, like 80 felt when you're short gamma)\n\nBut what about stocks like Tesla which are still moving wildly?  There's something else at play there, the market is seeing serious reverse skew in some of the story stocks, with upside call buying creating air pockets of negative gamma as the stocks go higher. (typical skew in options is more expensive downside puts and less expensive upside calls, retail demand in a stock like TSLA is causing it to flip, where upside calls price 'crashes higher')\n\nHere's a comparison of Tesla expected move vs the QQQ and SPY over the next month (impressive considering TSLA is now $2000 vs SPY and QQQ \\~$300:\n\n[*TSLA vs SPY vs QQQ expected move chart*](https://www.optionseye.com/content/images/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-20-at-1.02.21-PM.png)\n\nA stock like Tesla has a very different gamma profile as dealers/market makers have to buy stock as it goes higher to cover deltas of the call strikes they are short.\n\nThe thing that ties both of these aspects of the options market together, SPX gamma and TSLA's reverse skew... is that there isn't much demand for puts in either case. \n\nTherefore, If you were looking for a moment to look the other way in the market, either outright or as a hedge, downside is as cheap as we've seen since the beginning of the year.\n\nFor instance, here's a bearish price target, into October expiration in the SPY:\n\n*Bearish price target* [*trade comparison*](https://www.optionseye.com/content/images/2020/08/2020-08-20-13-14-29.2020-08-20-13_16_24.gif)\n\nThe long +338/-321 put spread to the expected move is extremely reasonable at around $4.50\n\nHere it is on the chart [\\+338/-321 ps](https://www.optionseye.com/content/images/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-20-at-1.15.17-PM.png)\n\nBuying around $10.50 and selling around $6 [legs](https://www.optionseye.com/content/images/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2020-08-20-at-1.15.41-PM.png)\n\nThe breakeven on that trade is around $333.50 and it is profitable down to $321 in the stock with a nearly 3 to 1 payout. \n\nThere's no guarantee what happens next in the market and what we've seen could continue (to re-appropriate a line: it can be boring for a lot longer than gamma can stay solvent). But some aspects of the options market are affecting both the market itself as well as providing an opportunity in case things suddenly shift.\n\nThe gamma is the overall market expiring today as well as the lack of demand for puts overall is allowing for some really inexpensive put spreads over the next few months.", "id": "idxxe2", "created_utc": 1598020721.0, "score": 234, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 85, "comments": [{"body": "Great insight especially from a MM perspective!! \n\nHow does the reverse skew on TSLA correct within the market?

It took 10-20 times less effort to program on the Next software as it did for competitors, which allowed small developers to pop up everywhere. A decade later when Next was part of Apple and Jobs was back as CEO, that accidental success at Next became the biggest success in tech history. It became the iPhone App store, and within 2 years it had more apps than Microsoft had in the previous 20 years. \n\nBut what has Tesla done that can possibly rival this? They just signed a contract for their first full size peaker plant replacement, an accidental byproduct of their car development. Peaker plants control excess demand on the grid, and its over a trillion dollar market. \n\nTesla megapack peakers cost far less than most existing peaker plants per MWh, and they are far easier to install and operate. They also have CRAZY profit margins, because the batteries sell for 300 dollars per KWh. This is almost 3 times the production cost. Vastly higher profit margin than any existing Tesla product. \n\nSo they have created a product that has massive demand and profit margins at existing prices, and it outperforms the competition in both price and performance.

I remember both the dot com and 08 crash, this is very different. During dot com, tech was all speculative and didn't have a clear value or business model. Today's tech has a clear value and it turns out an entire global economy can be ran through tech - hence the really high valuations. Not only is tech able to completely replace store fronts during a pandemic, but as we have just seen it can also allow business of any size or complexity to run in a cloud environment, and facilitate this transition over a couple weeks. All covid did was accelerate this time line, thus boosting tech's value. Add in the fintech revolution happening in the financial sector, and it is easy to see why tech has the valuations it does. Tech is everything - even tractors have AI autopilot features.\n\nThat said, of course we should expect pull backs. Even a bed of roses has thorns.
