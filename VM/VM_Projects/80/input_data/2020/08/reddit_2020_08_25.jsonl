It presents a fringe view of what S&P is likely thinking, painted by the TSLAQ short community that has been trying to get a journalist to champion this view for weeks. You could have at least offered the mainstream view of what investors are thinking, consistent with the sharp rise in the Tesla stock price over the past two weeks. \n\n“Tesla delivered a profitable 2Q in the midst of the worst economic downturn in 70 years, even with its main factory in Fremont, CA shut down for 8 of the 13 weeks of the quarter because of COVID19. If the Fremont Factory had been allowed to stay open, Tesla would have easily turned a profit without any regulatory credits. The rest of the auto industry lost $10B in 2Q. That Tesla was able to eke out a profit despite this backdrop is likely a feat S&P will find extraordinary.
