{"title": "Lets discuss the future of Tesla power products, which is likely to be one of its most profitable divisions.", "selftext": "So Im sure some of you have heard that Tesla has signed a deal to build the largest battery in the world to replace a 500MW peaker plant in California. \n\nWhat most of you probably dont know is that the profit margins on these systems are likely more than a magnitude higher, as the car batteries barely break even. The power system batteries sell for several times the price per MWh, and most of that is profit. \n\nThere are nearly a trillion dollars in these plants that need to be replaced within the next few decades, so a very good potential for it to have a healthy profit. \n\nBut thats just the peaker plants. There are a few trillion worth of other plants that need to be replaced as well. But Tesla is about twice the price it needs to be to replace those. \n\nTo replace a pair of 1MW plant and a 1MW peaker, this would require 6 Mega stations AND solar/wind to charge them. This appears to be 3 times the cost as a baseload/peaker combination, but in reality its only about twice because it saves hundreds of millions in fuel each year. This greatly reduces the total cost by 2-4 billion per decade. \n\nOnce Tesla cuts battery prices in half, this will be feasible. Because even at that price they still make a profit. Its still far above what they charge for car batteries. \n\nThere is one issue though. Its about 300 dollars per MW to install backup diesel generators for the few days per year that renewables are not available reliably. But this is only a tiny fraction of the total cost. These generators are about the size of a Semi truck trailer and each produce around 40MW, so it takes 25 of them positioned at local power distribution centers to act as backup. They can easily be installed at existing power distribution locations without an issue. \n\n**TLDR: Tesla has a market for 1000 peaker plants and then several thousand more baseload plants once its prices are half of what they are today. This is over a trillion dollar market over the next few decades. And with a much higher profit margin than the cars.**", "id": "icullt", "created_utc": 1597865553.0, "score": 76, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 81, "comments": [{"body": "I think they'll partake in the landgrab for retiring peaker plants, but ultimately large industrial markets like that pretty quickly drive toward undifferentiated commodity pricing.\n\nThe real opportunity is for the powerwall to become to the \"smartgrid\" something like what the linksys wrt54g was to \"broadband\".   10 - 20 million units would still only be a small fraction of the addressable market (130M households in the US alone).\n\nAfter that, they link them all together with a cloud service to form a virtual power plant.

So i'll  play devil's advocate:\n\n1)As far as i understand (not my field of study) grid stabilization goes beyond matching supply and demand. You need to provide \"inertia\" in order to keep stable AC frequency and correct phase shift between lines. This is done with literal inertia, in that is flywheels in gas and hydro turbines. Batteries cannot provide this type of stabilization, and solar panels are a wrench in it.\n\n2) Batteries dont scale well. To double the storage capacity you need to double the number od batteries. There are no economies of scale except for the production/instalation process. This is made worse by the fact that the minerals needed to produce the batteries are limited and have their own carbon footprint. Every single available battery should go into cars, stactic batteries are a waste of resources.\n\n3) There are other ways to store energy. They may not be as efficient as grid  batteries if looking at power out/in, but they have other advantages. Pumped Hydro is an abvious one, with also obvious issues, bu still is an option. Liquid air storage sounds great, seems to be commercially viable and solves both 1) and 2). To store more energy you need a bigger tank, not more turbines.\n\n3.1, slight rant) Personally i also believe in hydrogen. Its tabu because people only think of hydrogen fuel cells, but hydrogen goes much deeper than that. EU is is supporting the development of green hydrogen infrastructure, not only for niche transportation and trucking but, most importantly, to cleanup industrial processes. We need green hydrogen to make steel for our Teslas, and fertilizers to grow our food. From basic principles, we need it for basically everything! Look at the objects around you, made of wood or stone? No? Made of oil and gas! Industrial processes and agriculture are responsible for more than 50% of the carbon emissions (excluding electricity consumption). The only way to produce sustainable hydrocarbons is to make our own hydro and bond it to the carbon. Otherwise we are just digging it from the ground in more or less direct ways. Grid stabilization is just a side effect. Wanna talk about vertical integration? What about producing green hydrogen for steelmaking to use in cars and starships?\nTesla is tackling the transportation and electricity generation, wich is great, but producing green hydrogen could have an impact on the other 50% of the carbon pie, to which tesla is actually a contributer for as long as cars dont grow on trees.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": " 1-not correct.

Essentially, the system is able to compensate quickly enough with MW and MVAR that it can “fight above its weight”.  A traditional gas-fired plant would take 1-5 minutes to ramp up to speed to compensate–- what the design of the PowerPack/MegaPack does is keep the grid frequency above the trip point (but below nominal) to allow the other plants to soft-start or ramp up transparently.  A 100MW inverter cannot take the place of a 500MW turbine for long periods of time, but for instants/seconds it can.  That is what makes static technology so much more flexible.\n\nThe flow batteries are a random example, but it is always what comes to my mind when some of these other technologies are thrown about.  It seems to make sense that the power conversion portion of the equation is the most expensive part, but in reality the incremental cost of the storage (and implied energy) tends to make it an equal cost.  The costs always seem to end up much more linear than one would expect.\n\nThe air is not free-- you need to cool it and heat it, and that process has significant losses.

I think the problem with this topic is that because the batteries in Hornsdale works and makes them money, people immediately extrapolate that you can eliminate all peaker plants with it and the size of the market is as big as the vacuum left by eliminating them. Not true.\n\nTechnologies like pumped hydro, liquid air and air compression have thermodynamics losses when you put power in and out. But the high scaling factor makes a difference. Again, for the same power, to double or 10x energy stored in air or water you need to store as 2 or 10 times more air and water, and the rest of the system stays the same. From basic principles, the scaling factor is near infinite. We can easily afford the efficiency losses. Batteries are linear scaling and ther is no way around it.You can come up with many \"gotchas\" but you are also just choosing to ignore that mining nickel and lithium is a big fat gotcha as well.
