I mean, let's be real here, who can pass the US?\n\nEurope has a negligible amount of ambitious people, even more negligible is the amount of top 500 companies that they have, and *even more* is the number of Billionaires they have.\n\nAfrica and Middle east are out of the equation for reasons that don't need to be stated.\n\nSouth America is not a center for Labor (China/India beat SA), nor for Information/Technology (US/Europe beat SA), so but nono.\n\nAsia has Japan- which has a very small amount of great companies, and a very fragile economy- not going to surpass the US anytime soon. And Asia has China/India, both are great and all, but India jetlags by a lot, so let's just consider China (Like you implied in your comment).\n\nAre they a center for technology? No. Are they a center for labor? Yes, hugely. Are they a center for quality? No. Are they a center for quantity? Yes.\n\nYou see the pattern? Even though China's economy is strong and all, the fact that they *want* to be a country that values quantity over quality will hinder any chances that they will have to pass the US. And even if they were aiming for quality, because of their culture, poverty, and excess of people they will never be able to go for Quality- being a technology Vanguard like the US is. The vast majority of their population is EXTREMELY poor, their economy is seemingly built on government alteration of information, their culture is to be happy with what they have regarding the factories and such, and the amount of people that they have would make it impossible to focus on quality over quantity- too many would be unemployed if not for the mass labor coming from factories.\n\nWith that being said, it's not impossible for them to pass the US in a few centuries, but within the next 5-8 years it's impossible. You have to bear in mind that their economy's foundation is Two things: Production generated by the US, and economical lies by their government (Currency Manipulation, fake GDP information), and these factors make them ineligible to be the vanguard of... anything.\n\n", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 50, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "So you're saying we must construct additional pylons?", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Pylon block!", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Kek", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "We're going to void ray rush them all after we send in our proxy zealots.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Elon is building so many Toss Carriers and Tesla Cannons.
