Knowing data about Target, which sold their pharmacies to CVS a few years ago, they are within 10 minutes of 75% of the US population. Then you have freestanding CVS stores, Walmart, Costco, independents, grocery stores, online sellers and potentially Amazon. Yeah the amount of prescriptions filled is dominated by CVS and Walgreens, but it's not like there is a barrier to entry like Telecom spectrums or cpu licensing, and there are plenty of options.\n\nWhile this is clearly a reduction in choices, the pharmacy game seems far from a monopoly, even a duopoly.

IMO they are worried about Fred's being able to handle the 865 to 1,200+ stores required to be divested...see Dollar Tree/Family Dolalr merger and Alberstons/Safeway merger for examples of failed divestitures. \n\nWhich is dumb, IMO given that I'm pretty sure the FTC gave the go ahead for Fred's to buy the stores when they required the divestitures. In March Fred's hired a couple big wigs to help for the acquisitions, including a guy who worked at CVS and oversaw the acquisition of thousands of stores (Chris Bodine).
