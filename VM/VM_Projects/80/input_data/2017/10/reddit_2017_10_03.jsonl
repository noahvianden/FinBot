The decision to take profits after Tesla started a bear market in June, which it hasn’t exited after a full quarter (if exiting means exceeding the previous peak price), probably has more to do with accountability to shareholders and the short-term demands of the fund, because divesting from Tesla isn’t necessarily consistent with following environmental ideals.\n\nThe advantages Tesla has over established manufacturers are that it started with EV technology to build a car, rather than converting internal combustion cars into EV cars (to make use of existing PP&E), it is developing/patenting it’s own technology (thereby restricting its use), and it is about five years ahead of its competition.
