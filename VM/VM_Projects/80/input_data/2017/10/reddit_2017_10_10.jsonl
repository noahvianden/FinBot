{"title": "Who wants the next $VERI or $HMNY", "selftext": "I know everyone has been wondering, \"what's the next stock that I can buy low and sell high\" well the answer to that is simple, $XXII aka 22nd Century Group. \n\nWith the FDA and WHO bringing down the hammer on big tobacco and the harmful levels of nicotine $XXII is primed for H U G E success! \n\n22nd Century Group ($XXII) is about to close on a sale of 20.6 million shares to an INSTITUTIONAL INVESTOR which will raise the company's cash balance to more than $60 million- enough to meet all regular operating expenses for more than five years! \n\nKeep in mind, that's cash on hand before all the licensing deals with the major tobacco companies like Altria ($MO), Philip Morris ($PM), Alliance One ($AOI), Vector Group ($VGR), and Turning Point ($TPB) come into play! I promise you WSB, a deal is COMIMG SOON, that's guaranteed. \n\nWith the FDA cracking down in the United States and WHO cracking down globally, if big tobacco wants to keep selling cigarettes, they will need to contain/offer a cigarette with little to no nicotine. This is where 22nd Century Group ($XXII) comes into play! Even though they technically modified the genes in tobacco plants to contain less nicotine, by using their proprietary technology, the plants show ZERO signs of Being genetically modified. Big tobacco will be able to advertise a GMO FREE cigarette!! \n\nBig tobacco is shaking right now as regulations are coming for the multi billion dollar industry. Did you know Americans spent more at retail stores on cigarettes in 2016 than they did on soda and beer combined? I'll let that sink in. Revenues for U.S. tobacco companies hit $117 billion in 2016, up from $78 billion in 2001. When 22nd Century Group ($XXII) takes market share from big tobacco, you better believe it's going to SEND THIS STOCK FLYING! WSB will be full of \"$XXII to the fucking moon!!\" post. The success that this company is going to have is a once in a life time opportunity. You do not want to miss out! \n\nAlso, did you know, 22nd Century Group ($XXII) has proprietary technology to do the same with cannabis plants? The Company's ongoing research is product-oriented and focused on developing a range of next generation industrial hemp plants that contain optimized levels of medically important cannabinoids, such as CBD, CBC, and CBG. In collaboration with the Company's university research partners, they're also working to optimize Hemp varieties for various climates around the world. THC- FREE cannabis is an ideal agricultural crop and an excellent source of medically important cannabinoids. 22nd Century has the EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS  to commercialize the plants arising from these collaborative projects in the United States\n\nWith the cannabis market growing at an explosive rate this also puts 22nd Century Group ($XXII) at an advantage! The cannabis market in 2016 was around 16 billion dollars, by 2024 its expected to be around 64 billion dollars. As medical and recreational marijuana become legal all around the world, $XXII gets more exposure to the market share which means and INCREASE IN STOCK PRICE. \n\n\n22nd Century Group is a MUST HAVE  in your portfolio, they will either get bought out at an extreme premium or reach $100/share. It's never to late to buy into this company, any shares of $XXII you buy under $5 is a steal tbh. \n\nAs always, good luck faggots. \n\n\nL O A D  T H E  F U C K  U P  O N  $ X X I I \n\n", "id": "75ezrd", "created_utc": 1507613194.0, "score": 57, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 79, "comments": [{"body": "Instructions unclear: Buying VIX", "score": 70, "replies": [{"body": "Dyslexia's a bitch ", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Roman numerals are a bitch", "score": 7, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "$100 a share?

It has the same effect. You can roll a cigarette with less tobacco if you want to stop smoking. Anyway, there are much better ways to quit smoking.

Lutz said the cost could be minimized by genetically modifying tobacco plants, but this would *take about 20 years*.”  In contrast, 22nd Century already possesses proven technology to grow tobacco with non-addictive levels of nicotine. :) \n", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "The point of cigarettes is that they are addictive.

Also, copying from a prior comment I made:\n\nIt could lose in a few different ways.\nI think that the biggest way it can lose is the way they are going about this. Most are aware that the tobacco leaves combusting and smoke inhalation with all the carcinogens are the bad part in normal ciggies. Nicotine isn't that great but in comparison with the other stuff, not that bad overall.\nWith that in mind there are two strategies for creating a new sort of cig, one would be low nicotine and one would be high nicotine. The literature is quite clear that light/low tar/less nicotine cigarettes paradoxically cause more cigarettes to be smoked and deeper inhalations leading to more cancer. This is because smokers are addicted to the nicotine and need to take more of it in to feel a relief. Deeper puffs, more of them smoked. This is well known.\nThis is in opposition to high nicotine vaporizers where people get a whole lot of nicotine per inhalation but very little of the other nasties inside combustible cigs.\nWith this in mind I do not think this will be a success.
