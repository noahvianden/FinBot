{"title": "Today is the day that TastyTrade jumped the shark for me", "selftext": "Let me say that I do not believe Tom and Tony are malevolent in this, I just believe that they place too much emphasis on short premium because IV < HV and carefully choose the data in their studies to support that narrative. Their educational material _about_ options is top notch, their work to lower commissions is awesome, lowering the barriers for traders to make complex trades (naked shorts in IRAs) is laudable, and I think they come from a good place, but the methodology is just wrong.\n\n> https://www.tastytrade.com/tt/shows/options-jive/episodes/directional-plays-with-options-buy-vs-sell-08-14-2017\n\nThere are so many things wrong with this segment: the setup, the delta choices, the apples/oranges comparison, etc. They compare selling a short 30 delta put with $23,700 at risk with buying a 50 delta call with $375 at risk and claiming because the put returns +$55 and the long call returns less that the short put is better. Tom also says several times this is the foundation of their strategy and they've been saying that for years. And he keeps going on about how we should only focus on opportunity and not risk, ignore risk, only finance people focus on risk but the rest of the world focuses on opportunity.\n\nExcept... what? Let's pretend that I do accept everything in this segment at face value and I'm assuming here that this example is the best they have at communicating their story. Lets accept that the 50% put management was chosen because its the optimum choice, so I will also choose the optimum call strategy to compare (no management). These are the most generous assumptions possible.\n\nIf you actually look at risk (because, hey \"risk adjusted returns\" is a thing, and also tons of other TT segments go on about the importance of risk management, and like _I_ care about risk) you can see that ~~if I put the same amount at risk for the best call strategy ($23,700) it would return $23,700/$375 * $15 = +$948 to the short put's $55~~ I only need to do the call strategy 4 times risking $1,500 to achieve the same return as the $23,500 at risk for the put. How is the TT methodology of selling short premium better based on that backtest?\n\nHere's an alternative. Implied volatility tends to over-estimate historical volatility because of tail risk. No big traders want to be caught getting zeroed out from a big move so they buy protection. If you sell that protection, you are assuming the risk of getting bottomed out in a big move, plain and simple. \n\nYeah, that's \"insurance\" and insurance companies make money, but that's a poor comparison. Insurance companies work because they are _bigger_ than the smaller risks than they cover. _You_ are _smaller_. Not to mention that it misunderstands how large insurance companies make money, which is is by reinvesting the premiums they receive in other financial instruments. In many ways, insurance companies are actually just inexpensive ways of raising capital for other ventures (see: Berkshire Hathaway).\n\n\"Oh but that's why I do short premium as spreads because it defines my risk\". Nope! Short premium spreads mean you buy a further out of the money option, and if you are buying, you are no longer providing tail risk and thus you are eliminating whatever advantage you had by selling. This is kind of like re-insurance to keep the metaphor, which yes, is a thing, but no, insurance companies do not make money on the spread between those two.\n\nWhich is more likely? That there exists a long-term arbitrage opportunity by selling premium that somehow the trillions of dollars in capital has missed for 30 years and any random retail trader can take advantage of, or that there is no arbitrage because the risk of naked options is real and if you act to mitigate it you give up the advantage you captured by taking it on?\n\nEDIT: I used the word \"manipulate\" to describe the data selection process, that is perhaps a bit harsh as that has a specific negative context in the data world that implies deceit. Staying at a high level because the lower level tells a somewhat different story is not \"manipulation\" so much as conscious choice so as not to distract from a larger narrative. Whether that choice is warranted or not is left as an exercise to the reader, but its quite subjective...\n\nEDIT2: My math was not fair as pointed out by /u/tavianator, money management is important. It wasn't my intention to draw equivalence, merely pointing out the invalidity of the comparison.

The short answer is that I can't because I don't have access to the same data.\n\nThe longer answer is... we see only what they talk about, but you have to pay attention to what they _don't_ talk about and make a judgement call about why they chose not to talk about that. Either its because it _distracts_ from the narrative (which is reasonable to leave out) or because it _contradicts_ the narrative (which is not OK to leave out). Again, we don't know, we just have to infer.\n\nSo examples: They only ever talk about backtests as 2005-Date. Why? If we look at another backtesting service, lets use Quantopian, they also use that kind of 20xx-Date backtest but at the same time they show very specific scenarios, a crash in the market, a period where the market was steady, a sharp rise, a credit squeeze, a correlation breakdown, an interest rate spike, etc... We never seen how their strategies perform in those situations. They have the data, its actually easier than doing the whole thing, so why not? I think because a lot of it doesn't work over lots of different scenarios, only over 2005 to Date when the market went basically straight up. We call that \"overfitting\". :-)\n\nThey talk a lot about the \"net\" effect from a position, distance between the strikes (value at risk), net delta, net gamma, net theta, but never net IV. Why? If the idea is to sell IV when its high, and you are both buying and selling it, aren't you buying it high, too? And since IV _rises_ as you go out of the money to buy it, aren't you paying a _higher_ price than you're selling it for? Now I know you can't subtract IV like that because its a distribution, but the point remains, you can't have it both ways. But they only talk about the \"underlying\" IV (the IV of the four closest to 50 delta options).\n\n> could you tell me your thoughts on ... what the \"right\" way is? You advise always buying premium then?\n\nThat's kind of my point, there is no \"right\" way. Buying or selling. The market is, on the whole, in aggregate, quite efficient at pricing risks and only really breaks down in very small ways or in black swan scenarios because they happen so infrequently and for such different reasons that the models don't have much to train on. You and I are not smarter than the entire market. The way you and I make money in options is not by buying or selling because there's some inherent value in one or the other at the market level. That sort of rolls back up to my above points as to why the TT methodology doesn't work. \n\nThe way you and I make money is by understanding what the market's opinion is on a very specific part of a certain risk factor in a certain underlying and deciding if we agree or disagree. When you disagree, and you feel strongly that the market is way off and that the difference is likely to correct soon, you can structure a position to profit if that happens. Most people only have one risk to profit from, price risk (deciding if the stock is too high or two low). Options add a few more, two small ones (dividend risk and interest rate risk) and the more important one of \"risk premium\" a.k.a implied volatility. But they're just risks that are priced in like everything else.\n\nNow, it take a lot of knowledge to use options to profit from one specific risk without inadvertently being hurt by another one, like trying to profit because you expect IV to decline but you get killed by a sharp down move. So there is value in becoming more educated and you will be more successful for doing so, and TT can absolutely help in that regard.\n\nBut that is very different from claiming that there is one specific risk that is always mispriced across the entire market (in TT's case, IV is always too high) and thus you can profit from targeting that mispricing in any underlying no matter what.
