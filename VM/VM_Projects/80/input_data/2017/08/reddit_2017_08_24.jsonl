Still, they would be silent since baby moma--they knew--would hear them and become angry. Indeed the very waters which seemed to unravel baby moma mind, had the opposite effect upon that of the raccoon. They had only grew smarter, faster, stronger from the waters, and learned to help baby moma. Baby moma (who is always right) knew the swarm would be hers in time. The great roiling mass would reign with her, united--the raccoons loved baby moma and baby moma had returned their love ten-thousand--nay, one-million fold. And the more baby moma returned their love and drank of the waters, the more mighty they were. Clawing and screeching and eating, blood and teeth, their darting bodies would overrun the streets in great rivers of gnawing fur, swelling and pouring through the abandoned metropolis; the great multitudes of raccoon kind carved a new paths, enveloping the city, expanding beyond, city to city they moved in one great push towards a more perfect raccoon existence. \n\nThe world would kneel before the racoon empress--and all the lands of earth will bear witness to their own destruction, and succumb to the rabid justice of baby moma's vengeance.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "What in the fuck did I read", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "I mean with other stocks and savings...
