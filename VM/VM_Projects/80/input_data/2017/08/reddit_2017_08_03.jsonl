{"title": "How i made 10k with APPL Earnings, and how i plan to do the same for $NVDA and $Baba. AMA", "selftext": "My 150 C that i purchased for AAPL for $3.70 was sold for an average price of $10.50, and i bought 15 of them. Thats $10,200 \n\nMy short 152 C was closed for a profit of $750\n\nTotal profit: $10,950\n\nPlaying earnings are dangerous if you buy it for the sake of hitching a ride on its movement. \n\nI'm gonna teach you faggots on how to deal with earnings. \nFirst of all, i look through the earnings calander and look for companies that i can easily understand; usually consumer/goods industry - you know the usual buying and selling of products. \n\nAAPL is easy to understand and majority of their sales are based off their phones and their macbooks (pretty simple right).\n\nThey got a lot of cash, and they are one of the major players in mobile phones. \n\nChecking back through their previous earnings it seems that they beat consensus and it did have impact on the price (high volatility) and it also seemed that they reduce their consensus for the Q2 revenue outlook.\n\nAnd also in addition to the new Iphone 8 thats about to come out guidance will definitely be raised.\n\nSo i lock in a bull Call spread for AAPL, why bull call spread? cause i know there will be dips before earnings (either people are selling to avoid earnings etc) so when it does dips. I close my short position, and lo and behold it bounces back to the ATM long call. (there are still faggots out there that wanna get in the trade before earnings)\n\nAfter earnings has been reported. as expected guidance was raised and they beat the estimates. Price increase to ITM and i sold it at open for 1050. Dont hold any longer, people would definitely sell afterwards to lock in their profits. \n\nSo right now, am doing the same for NVDA; currently holding on to 10 bull spread calls 165 Long and 167.5 Short. yesterday close out my short for 1k profit. and it bounces back to ATM long. might wanna sell somemore shorts on friday to protect volatility on Monday. \n\n(same applies for BABA)\n\nwill upload proof once i reached home. Currently using Blackberry. \n\nFeel free to ask me anything\n\nEdit: http://imgur.com/cblawK1\n\n\n\n", "id": "6raxm0", "created_utc": 1501748742.0, "score": 147, "upvote_ratio": 0.76, "num_comments": 82, "comments": [{"body": "\"I'm gonna teach you faggots\"\n\nProceeds to post literally no DD and pure speculation. \n\nHave fun losing it all, you got lucky and nothing else.
