{"title": "I like $SNAP at it's $30B valuation", "selftext": "Seems like the consensus is negative on SNAP. Going to go against the grain here and say I like the company at its projected $30B valuation. Essentially, I think Snapchat fills a void in the digital ad space: the ability to launch massive non-targeted ad campaigns. Wanted to put my thoughts down somewhere, figured I would start a discussion here. I am going to assume that if you are reading this you have at least used Snapchat for 10 minutes and have a basic understanding of how it works. If I am explaining things about the app that don’t make sense, let me know and I can clarify.\n\nSNAP put out a ton of info in their S-1, check it out [here](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1564408/000119312517029199/d270216ds1.htm). Most of my ideas below I got from reading the S-1 and using the app. \n\nAlso, I am not going to go into any of the crazy disclosures in the S-1 or the share class structure. I have seen these brought up elsewhere. Feel free to discuss in the comments though. I agree they are concerning, but some of them are being blown way too far out of proportion in my opinion.\n\n**Intro**\n\nOverall, I think SNAP’s biggest competitor for revenue will be traditional cable TV. SNAP’s future is all about video advertising and that is why it is valued so high. [This is a great article](https://stratechery.com/2017/the-great-unbundling) with insight on how the Internet and social media has changed digital advertising, I would recommend checking it out before reading any further. FB has taken some ad dollars away from TV over the years, but advertisers still like TV ads at the moment because it gives them an affordable way to launch mass scale ad campaigns and hit as many people as possible (targeted ads on FB are expensive and hard to measure ROI).\n\nFor advertisers, one of the things that is appealing about Snapchat is how the ads are shown within the app, which is much different than FB/Insta/TWTR. Snapchat ads take up the entire screen, and are predominately video (except for lenses, will touch on that below). FB DOES have some video ads, however they still make a lot of money from shoving targeted text/picture ads in your news feed.\n\nVideo is going to power digital ad revenue growth going forward as advertisers switch from TV to digital. The typical TV advertisers make a few expensive commercials that they blast out on 200 different channels for a few months. They rinse and repeat a few times per year. This does not really fit the FB “targeted advertising” model. FB is definitely working on ways to capture these ad dollars (specifically by showing 30-60 second ads in the middle of longer videos), but SNAP’s business model is the perfect for it in my opinion. Yes, digital ads will be much shorter than TV ads, but the way the ads are created and consumed is much more akin to TV than to other forms of social media.\n\n**Competitors**\n\nFB/Insta are focused more on targeted ads (no idea what is going on at TWTR at this point), but I think that Instagram will slowly evolve over time to mimic Snapchat’s model. I do think SNAP still has an overall advantage at the moment because the beauty of Snapchat is that you do not have a profile and nothing is saved. Instagram’s implementation seems to work great for following celebrities, which very well may end up being the better way to do it (vs. Snapchat’s focus on direct messaging and interactions between friends), but when it comes to sending disappearing messages to other users, Snapchat still has the edge. FB/Insta/TWTR will fight for some of the same ad revenue, and they may compete for users and time spent in app, but ultimately I think traditional TV will be SNAP’s biggest competitor for advertisers.\n\nSNAP does not have the same specific data on its users like FB does, which gives FB the edge when it comes to targeted ads. The legacy traditional TV advertisers are not used to specifics on viewers, just some general age approximations and some assumptions you can make on a viewer based on what they are watching. SNAP is not trying to show specific targeted ads like FB, it is trying to hit as many users as possible.\n\t\nYou can definitely argue that Instagram’s moves will hurt Snapchat’s user growth (see below on users), but I don’t think it really does anything to address the real problem that Snapchat solved – You don’t want everything connected to your personal profile. Instagram just kind of threw in a bunch of features in its app that admittedly were stolen from Snapchat. With the way Instagram implemented them at the moment, to me it seems like they are “cool features” but not necessarily a focal point of the app. I think Snapchat has the edge in this regard because the purpose of the app is to open it up and start viewing these direct messages/stories, whereas FB/TWTR/Insta is all about scrolling through a news feed. At this point, Instagram Stories is kind of a side feature (which very well could become much more important in the future).\n\t\nI don't like the comparison of SNAP vs TWTR because they offer completely different products to advertisers. Snapchat has zero text ads, whereas pretty much every ad on TWTR is a text ad with a picture or link to download another app. Snapchat is all video ads, which is definitely where the money is in digital advertising (why did GOOG buy YouTube? Why has FB focused so much on video ads?). My opinion is that TWTR's current strategy cannot be profitable, and it will need to be bought out, change its strategy, or (more likely) both. TWTR will most likely focus on some kind of integration of its news feed with live events, but as of right now I really do not think TWTR and SNAP are competing for the same ad dollars.\n\nYoutube also competes in the digital ad space, but its usage is a lot different from Snapchat. Youtube videos are either 1) picked up from FB news feeds or blogs/forums or 2) users go directly to Youtube and search for specific content. Youtube is integrated with Google’s ad network, so targeted ads are much more the strategy at Youtube.\n\nOut of the social media companies, I think overall FB will be the biggest competitor for ad dollars. Advertisers will definitely utilize Instagram’s stories, but I think SNAP will better suit the needs of advertisers moving from traditional TV to digital. In reality, there will continue to be a lot of money moving into digital ads, especially video, so it's possible both FB/SNAP do well for a long time.\n\n**Users**\n\nPeople have been harping on SNAP for having fewer users than FB and TWTR, but I think that’s kind of a stupid argument. Not all users are created equal. FB might have over a billion users, but if 75% of them are in third world countries, do they even matter to advertisers? SNAP allegedly hits up to 41% of consumers aged 18-34 in the US on any given day ([source, other good info in here as well](http://www.adweek.com/digital/snapchat-launches-colossal-expansion-its-advertising-ushering-new-era-app-171924/)), which is exactly what advertisers want (and what they are used to getting with the old traditional TV model). In the S-1, SNAP states that they have great penetration in developed markets, which are really the only ones that matter for them as that is where the users are that advertisers want to reach.\n\nThe value of a SNAP user is much higher than on other platforms. Not only do SNAP users consume strictly video ads with the occasional lens ad (see below), SNAP ads are ALL full-screen and grab 100% of the user’s attention. No other platform offers this to advertisers at the moment (other than TV).\n\n[This article](http://seekingalpha.com/article/4043110-hyping-snapchat) has some interesting charts comparing revenue between SNAP / FB / TWTR at similar points in their corporate history, and SNAP looks similar to FB. These types of charts definitely help justify the $30B valuation.\n\n**Ad Products**\n\n* **Lenses (Filters)** – Advertisers can pay for a “sponsored lens”. Example of this is the famous [Taco Bell filter](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=taco+bell+snapchat+ad) that was viewed by a reported 224 million times. These filtes are effective because anytime a user gets a Snapchat message, a notification pops up on their phone. If there was a filter, **users are literally getting notifications to look at ads**. The best part for advertisers, is that if users like a filter they saw in a message, they are likely to use it in a message to someone else, giving that user a notification, who then sends to someone else… etc. *No other app or social media platform offers this to advertisers at the moment.* Instagram has tried to copy the model, but as I said earlier, I do not think it really gets at what Snapchat does well.\n* **Stories** – When sending a snap, users can add them to their “Story”, which stays up for 24 hours and any of their friends can see it. When viewing other user’s stories, SNAP sticks 3-10 second ads every few stories. On the user’s end, they see 1-2 minutes of short clips from their friends, and then see a 5 second ad. While watching a story or ad, users can tap the screen to skip. If they skip, advertisers do not pay. It’s a win-win. \n* **Discover** – There are about 15-20 media companies that are currently paying for their own sections in SNAP’s Discover tab. This is basically a big grid with a bunch of clickbait titles, where a typical user will go to once they have viewed all of their direct messages/stories. Examples of these companies are Comedy Central, USA Today, Cosmo, NFL, etc. In addition to making money from companies paying for space, SNAP also makes money off of ads shown during the content (which I believe is facilitated by the specific media companies, who give a cut to SNAP). Per the revenue breakdown below, this is where they make the most money at the moment, however it looks like Stories will surpass it next year.\n* **Sponsored Geofilters** – This is cool for users, but I’m not sure how big this will get. You can buy a sponsored lens for a certain geographical area, for example buy a filter that guests can use at your wedding. Looks to be about 9% of revenue at the moment. My understanding is that it will be dwarfed over the next few years as other ads pick up, but SNAP actually expects sponsored geofilter revenue to pickup in the future, so I am assuming I do not fully understand how they expect to scale it.\n\n[Revenue Breakdown](http://www.adweek.com/files/imagecache/node-detail/emarketer_us_snapchat_ad_revenues_by_source_2015-2018_215547.jpg) – Chart is from an [article published in September, 2016](http://www.adweek.com/digital/snapchat-will-hit-nearly-1-billion-ad-revenue-end-2017-173287/), but the % breakdown per segment is interesting. Comparing this to the S-1, it looks like 2016 revenue came in higher than projected.\n\n**Financials**\n\nLooking at their financials, I am not really seeing anything that says they will not be extremely profitable as long as revenue grows as they are projecting. Check out [this chart](http://i.imgur.com/JyCg6L0.png) from the S-1 that shows expenses as a % of revenue over the last 8 quarters. Seems like everyone has been making a big deal about them being unprofittable, but pretty much everything has been improving in each successive quarter. I would not be surprised if they are profitable in Q4 of 2017 and then for the full 2018 fiscal year. Based on their daily active user and average revenue per user numbers, and also some of the wording they use throughout their prospectus about the seasonality of ad buying by advertisers (Q4 is highest, Q1 is lowest), it seems like they are preparing investors for a slight dip in numbers in Q1. Not sure if it will trigger a sell-off, but it is definitely something to think about. But in summary, if they actually hit their revenue growth projections, looks like they will be profitable.\n\n**The Amazon Effect**\n\nHonestly, I would not be surprised if Amazon’s video strategy ends up indirectly effecting Snapchat. See the excerpt below ([source](https://stratechery.com/2016/the-state-of-technology-at-the-end-of-2016/)), emphasis mine:\n\n> Just consider Amazon Prime’s two headline features — free shipping and Prime Video — and then consider three of the primary industries in the consumer economy: **consumer packaged goods** companies leverage their size to secure shelf space in **big box retailers**; both are reached by people **driving their cars**. *These three industries are the largest TV advertisers*, and Prime is taking aim at all three: **Prime Video and its competitors are increasingly dominating non-live television viewing, and there are *no commercials***, while Amazon Prime obviates the need to visit retailers, and its infinite shelf space means niche products are much more viable.\n\nThis is obviously not going to happen over night, but it means either 1) Amazon tries to accelerate its attack on traditional TV, prompting TV ad dollars to migrate elsewhere or 2) Amazon ultimately runs all of Snapchat’s paying advertisers out of business (again, very long-term. Snapchat could not exist in five years). No one is really talking about this right now, but I think Amazon’s strategy is worth paying attention to.\n\n**Summary**\n\nOverall, I think SNAP has the best platform for un-targeted mas-scale video ads. They will eventually make a bigger push into live video, sports and events, etc. ([good info here](http://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-sports-content-from-nfl-and-others-will-be-key-to-snapchats-future-180808208.html)) and I think they are in a good position to do it successfully. FB has been trying to push Live and TWTR has been making moves based off its NFL streaming deals. I think SNAP has an advantage because the app is catered on right-now-in-the-moment experiences (the app literally opens up to a camera screen). A user doesn’t open Snapchat and see the 12th article arguing for/against Trump’s new executive order (FB), users immediately start generating and viewing content that takes up their entire screen.\n\nIMO SNAP’s corporate strategy is moving them towards VR/AR, and to me it seems like they are trying to position themselves to be the premiere VR/AR platform for advertisers. Nothing really exists in that space yet. They are claiming they are now a \"camera company\" instead of an app (which I know they explained as “you open the app to the camera”), but I can guarantee their spectacles experiment is not done. I am 100% certain they will continue to expand those to push into VR and/or expand their live broadcasting features, which will pit them even more against live TV than FB. I still think FB is a direct competitor, but ultimately I think their products serve different needs (FB for expensive targeted ads, SnapChat for cheap un-targeted mass ad campaigns).\n\nI thought it was ridiculous when I saw a headline two years ago they were valued at $3B, but I think that right now Snapchat has the best platform for advertisers who want to show video ads, of which the move from TV to digital will only accelerate with the decline of traditional TV and the move towards more of the Netflix/HBO model.\n\nEDIT: Just wanted to reiterate that I am not going long, just think that it won't be as much of a disaster as everyone is making it out to be.", "id": "5so8ll", "created_utc": 1486502657.0, "score": 84, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 85, "comments": [{"body": "Before everyone continues shitposting, this is the sort of content that we need to see here on WSB more often.

My thought is that they are going to get into live streaming events... they already do it. For the past 2-3 years, Snapchat has users adds their own pics/video to stories created for live events. Users have been used to going to Snapchat for this kind of content. I think Snapchat's strategy is to morph that into live event streaming.

The short answer, I don't think it is. Consider this, we are moving into an age where there is a sort of \"top 5\" app lineup that people accept as the must-have/mandatory apps. Facebook, for example. There is no alternative social media platform (fuck your 1000 person micro platforms) out there. \n\nThen Instagram. Now, for each of these apps, people share photos, but it takes a sort of nuanced understanding of the apps to know that they are completely fucking different. BUT, the point is, they have solidified their position at the top. \n\nMoving onto advertising. I will concede, Facebook's and Instagram's ads have become uncannily good, good to the point where I find myself double tapping ads to 'like' them on Instagram. It's compulsive though. I don't mean to, but my 'tism has me scrolling through the feed quickly, and has me quick to respond to pictures that are automatically appealing or contain one of my interests (outdoors, cars, tits). \n\nI've been reluctant to make an account on all of these apps, but eventually I caved with time (Facebook 2008, Instagram 2011, still never made a twitter, Snapchat 2012). \n\nSnapchat has made it this far for a reason. Those suggesting you wait to see what price action looks like are wise to suggest that. Getting in for a long position is probably a good idea. Especially with the interest backing this.
