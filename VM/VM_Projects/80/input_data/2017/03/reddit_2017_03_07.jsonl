{"title": "Should I feel bad for giving my friend \"bad\" advice?", "selftext": "So recently my feiends and I have been pretty interested in stocks. They really think I'm smart because I recommend AMD to them at around $10.30.\n\nLong story short I told one if my really close friends that SNAP would probably rise to 30-34 before it comes down. I didn't really mean for him to invest, but he did :s and for $1500 at around $25 dollars. When it was went up a couple of bucks I felt really good and and really smart. However, yesterday when it came down he was kinda angry and asked what he should do. I told him that unless he sells it won't be a loss. I figured it would come back up today, but I couldn't forsee the issues with the CIA and snapchat. So I am wondering two things:\n\n1. What should I tell him to do now? I am thinking it will come back up once the whole CIA deal blows over (Im guessing by this time next week it should be at $30 at least for a little bit)\n\n2. Should I feel bad for giving him \"bad\" advice because events that I couldnt see happened (CIA)\n\nThanks for the help guys - its been kinda a crazy week lol\n\n\n\nEdit: texted him saying that it is not my fault and he should not have listened to me. He texted right back saying that I owe him the difference?!?! Wtf lol\n\nI made him a lot of money on AMD but apparently he has forgotten\n\nI dont think i should pay him back, right? I do feel awefully bad\n\n\n\n", "id": "5y2tpx", "created_utc": 1488915010.0, "score": 23, "upvote_ratio": 0.68, "num_comments": 80, "comments": [{"body": "deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.7691  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/34863)", "score": 176, "replies": [{"body": "But don't pay your friend.
