If you don't want to provide an e-mail, just PM me for it, otherwise you can find it here: https://spreadstreet.io/stock-spreadsheet/\n\nHey all,\n\nI know some of the members in the group prefer to work in Excel (including myself) so I created a spreadsheet that looks at trending symbols and estimates bullish/bearish sentiment. I never had the time to develop software engineering skills, but the recent launch of a few add-ins has allowed regular joes like myself to harness the power of APIs.\n\n**Requirements:**\n\n1. Excel\n\n2. Blockspring Add-in (can download from within sheet)\n\n3. A StockTwits account (Free)\n\n**What it pulls:**\n\n- Trending Symbols (30 at a time)\n\n- Historical Price Data (Up to 5 years)\n\n- Recent News\n\n- Recent Tweets\n\n- Bullish/Bearish Sentiment of recent tweets\n\nHoping this is something that is useful to the group, and I am more than happy to help peeps setup the sheet so they can use it. Just send me a message on here or to my inbox.\n\nFull Disclosure - I am in no way affiliated with Microsoft, Blockspring, or StockTwits. I just happen to find the services very valuable. \n\n**As requested, Google Sheets link has been added to the spreadsheet.**", "id": "619r4p", "created_utc": 1490371131.0, "score": 402, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 91, "comments": [{"body": "1.
