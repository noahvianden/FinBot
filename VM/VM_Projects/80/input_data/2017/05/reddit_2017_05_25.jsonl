Each contract applies to 100 shares, so he bought the option to buy 10,000 shares at $980 per share. This option to buy cost him $2.76 per share. This means he put in a total of $27,600 for the first line.\n\nThe price of amzn now is $994.45. The price is $14.45 *more* than what he agreed to buy the shares for. Spread this $14.45 over each of the 10,000 shares he agreed to buy and you get a profit of $144,500.\n\nThis is $1k more than what the profit says on the first line and I'm not certain why... maybe he paid $1k in fees to make this trade?\n\nI'm just learning too and the best way to get the correct answer from the internet is to post an incorrect answer first.

Is this just a literal 'Option' to buy the stock? If the price went down to $970, would he still have to buy them at a loss? or not because he paid $27,600 for the 'option' to buy them?\n\nIf he was going to buy 10k shares at $980 does it mean he has almost $1MM to throw around? or could I do the same thing with only $27,600?\n\n*edit: \"There are no margin requirements if you want to purchase an option because your risk is limited to the price of the option.\"  Wait.. what?
