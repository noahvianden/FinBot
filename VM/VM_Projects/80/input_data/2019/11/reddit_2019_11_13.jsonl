{"title": "Slack tendies - Uber crash v2", "selftext": "Alright so I always complain about never hearing about the big plays until it’s way too late and the tendies have already been had. I blame this on two things, people not sharing actual good DD and being retarded. \n\nSo I bring before you the opportunity to short Slack (WORK) for the same reason a lot of you shorted Uber a week back. These two companies have a lot in common, mostly by hemorrhaging money and being a being guided by the same Adam Neumann leadership style of “pretend you know what you’re doing”. \n\nNow just like Uber, Slack has earnings coming up and their expiration for lockup in the same 2 week span (earnings 12/4, expiration 12/17). Just like Uber they’re not profitable and are seeing lots of insider selling (half a billion worth in fact). Now the news cycle has yet to start reporting heavily on this like they did with Uber a week before these same events came up for them (they ended up falling >15% in a couple days). I played their fall for a sweet 300% and plan to do the same for Slack. I’m currently holding my entire portfolio in 12/20 Put @ $18. \n\nFull Disclosure: while I did make up 300% on Uber being a dumpster fire I am still down 40% on the all time. Also I am retarded. \n\nTL;DR buy Slack puts for mid/late December\n\nUpdate: Fuck I'm retarded and now also broke", "id": "dvrtkb", "created_utc": 1573652018.0, "score": 75, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 89, "comments": [{"body": "\"If it's owned by Softbank, short that shit homie\"\n\n-- Warren Buffet", "score": 122, "replies": [{"body": "Definitely a legit quote.", "score": 15, "replies": [{"body": "Its got \"\" marks it must be a real quote, only quotations have quotation marks", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "Also, \"if it's on the internet, it's true.\" -Abraham Lincoln", "score": 13, "replies": []}, {"body": "That's #science.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "\"That's #science.\"\n\n-- ObamacareForever", "score": 8, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "SoftBank: \"I AM NOT A DESTROYER OF INVESTOR FUNDS.

Before Teams had really taken off we were doing an analysis of Slack v Teams for a pilot.

With Teams being offered as part of O365 and replacing Skype for Business it was obvious even back then that this would change.  \n\nEssentially Microsoft looked at Slack, took onboard everything they had done and made a product that has most of the same functionality and released it to a massive existing user base.  Unless Slack can start differentiating itself further it will hemorrhage users year after year as more companies line up (outside SF at least) to suckle at Microsoft's O365 teat.
