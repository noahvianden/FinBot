But perhaps it is our own perception of how \"stable\" these T-Bills really are that is the inherent flaw in all of this. I understand the importance of printing money for paying off these debts, but doesn't this money only have so much buying power that it can contribute before it starts to diminish the value of a dollar? \n\nI guess my overall thought on this is that we're overvaluing the United States as well... It seems to me like their ENTIRE economy is built up on credit that they are seemingly unable to pay off. I feel like theres only so long that these debts are put off before they just have to default. And in terms of T-Bills, in a way, its just more \"credit\". Its the government borrowing from its citizens. It just seems to me like \n\nI hear what you're saying. But I guess my position on all of this is that we're overvaluing the safety and security of these T-Bills and undervaluing the risk given the fact that these loans that we give to the government are paid back in interest to us with money that they loaned while still using the principle to pay off their other loans. Pardon my language, but this seems retarded. Essentially, these T-Bills are being sold to us as a system that generates slow and steady wealth for us, but in reality we're loaning money to what I would consider an un-credible institution... It just makes me wonder how much longer these Government agencies can play above the law before it all comes crashing down.\n\nThis is something that has been on my mind now for a little while and I've come across the thought that this could spell the end of capitalism... I genuinely think that if anything can do it, this is it. And I do think, that this is it. I just can't get behind the argument that the U.S. will continue to be that type of global superpower just because it has been the last hundred plus years.\n\nI appreciate all the insight and help in answering my questions, by the way.

If you have a policy that seeks to inflate asset prices (mortgage backed securities, stocks, etc.) by printing money, asset prices get inflated as well. Chart the S&P vs. US GDP since ‘08 and you’ll get some idea what this looks like.\n\nThat said, the idea of the U.S. being not credible presumes there’s another game in town. There isn’t. China’s capital markets still aren’t fully open. Yields are actually negative in Europe and Japan, where growth is close to zero.

From my understanding, Trump is, in a way, taking a similar approach with his principle that the U.S. should bring all its jobs back within itself, and close its borders, and rely on internal production, etc. Would you say that, in some ways, Trump is treading towards a similar economic plane that carries some resemblances to China?
