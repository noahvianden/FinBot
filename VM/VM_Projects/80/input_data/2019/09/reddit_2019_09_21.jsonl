{"title": "Enhanced Summon Manual", "selftext": "Enhanced Summon is designed to allow your car to drive you (using your phone’s GPS as a target destination) or a location of your choosing, maneuvering  around and stopping for objects as necessary. Enhanced Summon works in conjunction with your Tesla mobile app, so your phone must be within approximately 65 meters (213 feet) of your car.\n\nTo access the feature in your Tesla mobile app, tap Summon then tap the Enhanced Summon icon. TO activte Enhanced Summon, press and hold COME TO ME button. Alternatively tap the target icon, set the target destination of your choice by adjusting the map, and then press and hold the GO TO TARGET button. You can stop your car from driving at any time by releasing the button.\n\nTo reduce the time it takes for Enhanced Summon to warm up, you can keep your car ready by enabling Summon Standby Mode by going to Controls > Autopilot > Standby Mode. If selected ON, you can exclude Home, Work and/or your Favourite places be selecting checkboxes. If a location is selected, Standby Mode will be disabled when your car is parked near those locations.\n\nAdditionally, Enhanced Summon also integrated the HomeLink and can, for example, open your garage door and drive your car out of your garage at the press of a button. Like Summon, Enhanced Summon is only intended for use in private parking lots and driveways. You are still responsible for your car and must monitor it and its surroundings at all time within your line of sight.\n\nNote: To use Enhanced Summon, download the latest version of the Tesla mobile app (3.9.1 or later), enable GPS on your phone, and ensure you have cell service. Enhanced Summon will stop driving if cellular service or connectivity is lost.
