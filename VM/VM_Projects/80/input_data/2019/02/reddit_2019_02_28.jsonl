If you have a bad broker, I think that can happen... but they (\\*correction) ARE obligated to offer the NBBO, though their data may not be up-to-date. To pay $1 for something that seems like it would be offered around $.1 by market makers sounds like a big problem. Either they're a dishonest broker or they had some failure getting you a market price, like a delay obtaining NBBO data or something.\n\nDoes anyone have insights on this? Maybe call the broker and see why it was filled at that price, my main question being \"Was there really no better best-offer on the market?\"\n\n\\* Your uploaded image shows IB as the broker, and they're known for having good spreads. It also shows ISE as the exchange, so I can't make sense of what happened. Why don't the trades show up in the charts?", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah, I was thinking the same. IB seems to treat market orders as \"execute ASAP no matter what the price is\" and they steer you into using IBALGO/Adaptive orders for general cannot-be-bothered-to-type-the-limit orders. So I thought I got filled from their own inventory until I saw the trade confirmation say ISE.\n\nThough, it is possible that this is still what happened. I used SMART, not directed order and statement fields are sometimes a bit fucky with IB (like missing contra-broker for ACAT transfers etc.)\n\nThough what I did was stupid, I knew it was somewhat risky to open a blind order like this, but I thought NBBO would prevent me from getting filled at such an outlandish price.

Maybe they don't bother calculating reasonable offers on options that have no open bids.\n\nIf no fuckery took place, I think that the best offer left open overnight really was $1, and IB executed before any normal-hours offers came in, and they did execute the trade internally, maybe squaring up on ISE later (1 sec later?) at a much better price.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "3/1.
