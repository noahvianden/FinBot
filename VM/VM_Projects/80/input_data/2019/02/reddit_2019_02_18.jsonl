Overall US debt has doubled in the past 15 years however the cost of servicing that larger debt load today is lower than it was in the 80s and 90s as a percentage of GDP. The combination of low interest rates and America’s ability to play by a totally unique set of financial rules (because it’s the sole superpower and the dollars status as the global reserve currency) gives the US government the ability to run almost unending deficits (within reason). Over time US economic growth erodes the value of the debt, paying back government debt would be a horrible waste of resources.
