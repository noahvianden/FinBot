On top of that, here‚Äôs something that I haven‚Äôt seen anyone consider really; people today are addicted to their phones, and they will pay for services due to the ease and mindlessness behind most transactions.

Apple pay is by far the largest mobile pay platform in the world, and they only introduced it a few years ago! As of this quarter, they TRIPLED the amount of transactions of their platform compared to last quarter and are still expecting more rapid growth. That is innovation. Their airpods are a completely new product which have already become a massive trend amongst people and are still growing... the features which differentiated it have not been seen with other headphone makers; that is innovation. I've actually had friends only switch from Samsung to Apple however I like in a fairly affluent area so my experience is probably not representative of what most Americans use. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's the thing I've learned with investing in companies; management is one of the most important parts of all. Apple realized that their sales were dropping as they raised their prices, SO they combated that with focusing on services to continue to grow! If they were a bunch of blundering idiots like you suggest who couldn't forecast future demand, they would probably sit on their asses and pull in as much money as possible before the company died eventually (although that wouldn't happen for a long time). The fact that Apple's management has been so keen and realized this trend early on and are already driving new areas of growth IS innovation, not for consumers, but for shareholders.
