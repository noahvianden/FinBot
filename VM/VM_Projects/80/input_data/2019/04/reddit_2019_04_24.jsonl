This isn’t unique. \n\n2) Tesla is talking about comparing its vehicle to other dissimilar vehicles. This is interesting because the current insurance model bases pricing on the driver not the vehicle - it references make/model just to insure adequate coverage.  Granted more sophisticated insurers are using ML/DL to improve pricing with alternative variables, this is still the norm. I’ll also caveat that a number of startups are shifting the approach away from driver to pricing based exclusively on vehicle (which is the logical next step w/ AVs) however there’s not enough loss experience to prove this out and back testing isn’t good enough, especially in auto where loss ratios have been running hot for pretty much every carrier.  I suspect  this move is based on the bullishness of Teslas becoming fully autonomous soon. Otherwise the risk is still quite similar...\n\n3) the idea of offering insurance at the POS isn’t new and other firms are heading in the same direction. \n\n4) this wouldn’t be the first firm that thinks their risks are different and bring it all in house only to get burned and off load it in a few years.
