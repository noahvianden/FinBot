A novice ok a different reddit post asked why newer commercial planes sometimes have the appearance of being “too big for their wings” and an aeronautical engineer explained that one possible explanation is that electronic flight management systems are designed to manipulate and moderate inputs to correct a planes balance while flying, and that as a result control surface area can be decreased since aircraft aren’t being flown with manual cable inputs (id have to find the post), and that in the event of something like an engine failure, systems to stabilize the aircraft can ease flying.\n\nSpecifically for the 737, Boeing has made continuous aerodynamic improvements to the wing, over iterations, from the original series to the classic, next generation and now the MAX, incorporating technologies that extend the range of the aircraft while decreasing fuel consumption. A major reason why the 737 looks similar to its earlier variants is actually driven by airlines. Boeing originally wanted to change the flight deck to be more similar to the 757 which would have increased the pilots field of vision on the ground, but Southwest Airlines and some others rejected this because it would have removed commonality with earlier versions of aircraft they already owned.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "I know you're getting upvoted but you're spreading misinformation.
