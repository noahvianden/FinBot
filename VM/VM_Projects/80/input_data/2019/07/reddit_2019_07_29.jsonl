However, Tesla’s FSD is far from a moat. It doesn’t offer full autonomous mode (despite the name lmao). They’re mainly autonomous on the highway, and allows for self parking. That’s not really unique, as most higher end German cars offer the same tech. Now, if they’re able to live up to that name and offer actual full FSD tech, and beat out their competitors, then I’ll agree with you. That’s where most of their current market capitalization comes from — the hope of being first to the market for their actual FSD tech. \n\nFor battery, they don’t really offer substantial improvements. Most of it is incremental in nature (10-20% higher capacities compared to competitors). That’s great, but not really a massive moat that justifies their current cash burn.
