First people complained that they hadn’t set funds aside. Now they do, and people complain more. Good god. The families lit Boeing up with lawsuits from day 1. They should be suing the airlines\n\n\nThe fact that Lion Air is still operating blows my mind. The maintenance is horrible, they even knew the sensor was faulty and failed to fix it 3 times. If I recall the flight before the actual crash, almost crashed. But they ended up landing successfully. Told maintenance about it, and they said it was fine. It goes up again and we know how the rest goes. \n\nEthiopia Air, on the other hand definitely had a faulty sensor as well, probably for the same reason. Whether or not the maintenance knew of it, is the question. But what I do know is that those pilots lacked basic tools for flying. They did properly address the issue, they identified it correctly. And they would have been okay if they let the switches cut out and kept their speed in check. They ignored the overspeed warning for many minutes and any pilot knows that’s unacceptable to ignore your speed while dealing with control issues. THEY NEEDED TO SLOW DOWN, just like anyone else dealing with a runaway stab situation. Perhaps this is a result of Airlines taking advantage of technology and rarely training pilots anymore. Ethiopia had a Max8 sim. The co pilot, who was young, and had 200+ hours, hadn’t logged one hour or minute in it. Hmmmm \n\n\nI’m a pilot, I fly the 777, I just came from flying the 737, I’m very familiar with Boeing aircrafts, and I do know that pilots do not need to know of mcas, all they need to know is that the aircraft is making an unwanted downward pitch, and that’s it. The procedures for this are the same as any other runaway stab. Autopilot or any other system can malfunction, and improperly handling the situation will result the same. This is why the media reported that the class for the Max was only an hour on a iPad. Because pilots have already learned the hard part. Once you’re typed into the 737, let’s say you begin at 737-600. To move up to the 737-800 or anywhere, even down from the 600, it’s typically an hour class. I’ve had some classes that were 30 minutes, taken from home on my cell phone. Boeing keeps these procedures the same for everything, this way it’s a bit easier to transition into another aircraft, and pilots won’t hear about all the other procedures that are different, but from the same issue, amongst other aircrafts. You’ll hear the same procedure for just about anything unless you’re talking with a pilot who’s typed in an Airbus or something else. Sensors do not crash a flight, and Airbus already proved that. In 2008 an A320 equipped with 3 AoA sensors, had a similar accident. At cruising altitude, 2 AoA sensors failed, the 2 rejected the 3rd sensor. That flight ultimately crashed and killed everyone on board. The pilots were still at fault because they handled the situation incorrectly. This is why Boeing didn’t add more sensors, and it’s why airlines refused to purchase more as a safety feature. If technology fails on an aircraft, it’s probably best to not rely on it anymore. It’s not safe. \n\nBut like I said, the media is playing this out like pilots were surprised at this situation. No. This situation is not new, it happens for all sorts of reasons. The crew knew exactly what they dealing with. They said it was AoA related, that it was a trim. And they hit the cut out switches. They would be alive today if they left it cut out. Boeing’s procedures clearly state to leave the switches cut out for remainder of the flight. The captain went against it because he couldn’t get autopilot to connect. Turning on a failed system is not a pilots job. At times you have to face the reality of remembering everything you’ve learned and manually fly this aircraft. The captain was desperate to get autopilot back on, he tried about 6 times unsuccessfully, while the F/O told him nothing worked. They couldn’t get the answers they were looking for, all because of their speed. And it’s another reason why they couldn’t recover from the last pitch. The crew was not baffled or snowed by mysterious elements that they didn’t understand. The aircraft was flyable, and the situation was entirely preventable. I feel bad for everyone involved. Especially the passengers who probably thought it was being done on purpose.", "score": 21, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Let me edit this in. Runaway stabilizer procedures in the 737 have remained pretty much unchanged since its first flight. The same can be said for pretty much any Boeing airliner.\n\n1 - Turn off the autopilot to see if it's causing the problem.\n\n2 - Oppose the trim manually with the yoke. If that stops it, you're done.\n\n3 - If that doesn't work, then you turn off the stab trim cutout switches.\n\nIf MCAS is getting some kind of erroneous AOA signal and inputting an unwanted nose down pitch, guess what? Those procedures will stop it. If pilots at airline X get to step 2 and think they're good and MCAS starts another input after it's initial 10 second trim, then they go to step 3\n\nIt is easy for me to say, because I’ve dealt with control issues at much lower altitude than that, I’m talking barely over 1,000.  \n\nTo prevent any further confusion ill carefully explain this. MCAS has no more potential for catastrophic consequences than the basic stab trim system or autopilot control on a 737-200 in 1967. Any of those systems can malfunction and the results of an IMPROPERLY handled malfunction would be the same. Boeing's not going to add \"If the failure is determined to be MCAS, then blah, blah, blah........ to the Runaway Stabilizer procedures because it doesn't matter. The symptoms and solution of some kind of MCAS failure are basically the same as any other stab related malfunction. A pilot wouldn't need to know why his aircraft was pitching down uncommanded - just that it is and there are long established, proven procedures that he's supposed to follow.\n\nTrim runs when unwanted, there are two cutoff switches, easily accessible, and trim isn't subtle or unseen in the 737. It's very obvious. It's noisy, it's very visual, and it's tactile. There is NO doubt that the trim is moving, and if that's happening without the autopilot engaged and the pilot isn't trimming, there can only be one possibility, and one solution. \n\nAllowing it to happen repeatedly, no excuse. Cutting it off, then reversing that action to enable trim again, also inexcusable. Accelerating to 600+ KIAS, beyond excusable, very controllably the entire time. \n\nTwo similar incidents in third-world countries, with at least one FO at a ridiculously low experience level, flying the aircraft.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": ">Let me edit this in.

Any unwanted trim down in a 737 is a runaway stab procedure. It doesn’t matter what system is in the aircraft. Boeing set it up that way from the beginning of their time for SAFETY.

Boeing could only train you for a day or two. Compared to the years you’ve spent with your airline, who’s responsible for keeping you up to date with procedures? Employers. Ethiopia had a Max8 sim and the FO with only a few hundred hours never spent a minute in it. How’d the pilot save lion airs flight before the crash? From the basic procedure. They also knew what the sensor was doing. They knew of it and failed to fix it 3 times. Ethiopia had thrust set to take off, due to the climb on take off. But they weren’t climbing. They were dealing with control issues. Should have reduced thrust. They knew exactly what they were dealing with. They said it was AoA related. That it was trim. They verbalized this. Understand if you can: they diagnosed it correctly. But they went against procedures by putting the switches back which Boeing clearly highlights that you shouldn’t. Both crews went against procedures. You do not go against procedures in this industry unless you wanna die.

Poor dude, cnn flight school gave you confidence to talk about something you don’t know. \n\nThey did not follow procedure.

They initially hit them, they didn’t deal with mcas after that, they dealt with control issues and allowed the overspeed warning to impact for over 3 minutes. The captain put the switches back on, to enable trim, that’s when it nosed over again and struck the ground. The procedures state, for the last time, to leave the switches cut out for the remainder of flight. Not turn it back on if you feel like it. They couldn’t get the electric or manual trim to work because they allowed speed to increase well past VMO. I’m sorry you’re clueless to understand this, I don’t expect you to either, you’re misinformed by the media. It’s not your fault. I forgive you, but don’t tell a pilot how his job works. Anybody performing a runaway stab needs to SLOW DOWN, they needed to resort to flying the aircraft. Yoke,Throttles, pitch, power, CRM....basics.

But if they did, wouldn’t ya think the training in a 737 would be fairly easy and not forgotten if it was so common? Boeing rarely trains pilots. You can get your type ratings for a 737 at many independent schools. And it’s probably the best choice to do so if you’re paying out of pocket. Airlines will often get you typed in an aircraft, but all the training is through them. I’m not sure if you’ve noticed. But with the 747 being phased out, mostly used for cargo because that’s the only place the airlines will turn a profit using the 747. The A380 was a huge mistake by airbus. Airlines do not want bigger aircrafts. Hence why the 787 and 777 have become so popular. The fuel is efficient and they ideally get enough passengers in them. Look at how much a 747 holds and then compare to a 787. They’re cramming people in these “wide body” aircrafts. Right now the airlines want the most fuel efficient aircraft, and that’s the Neo and 737. The amount of fuel it saves, plus the extra capacity is making them a lot of money. Or you can buy anything bigger than the 787 and you’re probably not making much. There’s only so much fuel you can save with a typical capacity rating. Aircrafts have also gotten expensive. Due to labor costs  and cost of technology alone. This has sent prices through the roof. It makes no sense to buy a 747 or an A380. What you’ll see from this, is more smaller aircrafts, which save a lot more fuel. Take a look at airline stocks. They’re not doing much, thanks to many cheap airlines, who originally came in doing it cheap as possible, other airlines had to lower prices to keep up. Now we have this situation. Airlines are taking the bare minimum while taking on such a huge demand. They try so hard to keep up which usually results in them going bankrupt.
