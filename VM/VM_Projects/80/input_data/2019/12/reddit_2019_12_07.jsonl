I'm so confused.", "selftext": "TL;DR:\nNestl√© bad. \nEndless money printing is weird. \nInvesting is gambling.\nMaybe a market crash would be a good thing?\nNext week will be an interesting week.\n\n\nUK citizen here. I went on a trip to Nestl√© recently because I'm a student interested in their graduate program. I got lost, and ended up walking past the nearby Cargill factory and took a mental note of how close it was to Nestl√©. \n\nWhile at the Nestl√© factory, I asked the person giving the tours if they get their chocolate from Cargill. She said no, and pointed out the window to where they were making Smarties and Kit-Kats - but then I was a little clearer about what I meant, and I asked where they manufacture the chocolate itself - not just where they assemble the final product. She was little less confident, but still assured me that it's made onsite... somewhere.\n\nTurns out Nestl√© and Cargill are currently being investigated for working together + turning a blind eye to child/slave labour in Ivory Coast. I'm still gunna eat their chocolate, but I think this is interesting for obvious reasons.\n\nCargill is a privately owned American Company. The Cargill family are stupid rich. Both Cargill and Nestl√© bonds are eligible for the UKs Bank of Englands Bond Buying Program - meaning that the UK can print money to loan these companies money (in a very round-about way). \n\nI have a HSBC Bank account. The overdraft fee for my account will go up to 40% soon. i.e. my bank will let me accidentally spend more money than I have, but with charge me 40% interest for the privilege. For a lot of people, this is up from 10%. I am a student, so for me, the overdraft facility is free (until it isn't) - and this free overdraft was one of the main reasons I choose HSBC when I was 18. \n\nThe UK's Bank Rate is 0.75 - below is inflation target. It's supposed to be this low to encourage other interest rates to fall which in theory would help to facilitate economic activity.\n\n(Cont. in comments)", "id": "e7kouw", "created_utc": 1575756234.0, "score": 543, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 87, "comments": [{"body": "It felt like this was going somewhere and then it just didn't.", "score": 904, "replies": [{"body": "It‚Äôs blossoming autism", "score": 296, "replies": [{"body": "Or cocaine", "score": 91, "replies": [{"body": "meth", "score": 30, "replies": [{"body": "Meth doesn‚Äôt exist in proper countries", "score": 27, "replies": [{"body": "I wish", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "Meth grows on trees in Redding, CA", "score": 17, "replies": [{"body": "holy shit lol facts too close to home", "score": 9, "replies": []}, {"body": "True", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "Chico as well.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "I mean, you can always make it yourself.
