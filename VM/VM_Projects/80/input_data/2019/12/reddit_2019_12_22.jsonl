Which is kinda a CPU licensed out by ARM for other companies to put in their chipsets. It's the same type of processor core used by all mobile phones, even Apple uses ARM based chips so it's not like Tesla started from absolute zero.

HW3 can also run in fall-over mode: one half of the chip does the exact same calculations as the other side.

Semiconductors moves fast and even if they don't particularly need it, TSMC have 7nm+ in production with 40% performance over HW 3's 14nm, 50% less energy usage, 2.6x higher density. Tesla chip team can just port hw3 over to the newest node and cut down on power usage, smaller chip to reduce cost, it just like a no brainer. I think the chip team operates kinda independently and work on just providing the highest possible performance to the machine learning team who then gets to figure out what they want to do with it.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Oh die shrinks absolutely make sense, for the power savings as well as the cost curve on older nodes eventually favoring newer ones once most customers are moved over.
