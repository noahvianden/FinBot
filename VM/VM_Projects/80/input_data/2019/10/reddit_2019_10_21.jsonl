The company has good financial health. The technical analysis shows it’s in a position to gain and earnings beat might be the catalyst that gets it past $3 tho it may not hold that for long. The stock is just coming off its all time low. They’ve already released two major bad news earlier this month ahead of earnings which they could’ve held on to. This has now been priced in so any news that’s not bad may just be enough of a catalyst. I’m eager to see what they have to report.
