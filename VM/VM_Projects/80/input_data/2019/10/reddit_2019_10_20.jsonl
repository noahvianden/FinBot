This is especially seen in dividends- if a company always declares $1million in dividends, then with less shares outstanding the owners receive a larger dividend (treasury stock doesn’t get dividends paid on it). \n\nBoth dividends and share buybacks return money to shareholders but there are advantages and disadvantages to each.

When they do sell, as long as they hold it for more than a year the tax is capped at a much lower rate than the majority of shareholders marginal rate. \n\nSo not only do buybacks defer taxes (time value of money is key), they also (for the most part) allow shareholders to pay a much lower tax rate on the gains than they would pay on dividends.
