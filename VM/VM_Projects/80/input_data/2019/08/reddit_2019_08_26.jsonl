The underlying isn't volatile, so the implied volatility of the options drop. There aren't any direct consequences for the underlying, just that the value of all TSLA options declined today. When the underlying is very volatile there is a higher chance that options will hit their strike price, so they are worth more. If TSLA is flat at 211-215 for many days, then it's stable and the options have a lower probability of hitting their strike so the value declines. This is the effect in practice today. Trading options, in its simplest form, is betting on volatility.\n\nAnother way to look at IV is how expensive options are. In the Black Scholes model IV is merely a plug to arrive at an option's current value, defined as what market participants are willing to pay. If more buyers demand options the IV increases and the opposite is true, too. Of the 5 inputs to the Black Scholes model let's assume 4 inputs are held constant while IV is the dynamic variable. If you are willing to pay $3 per call option, then IV might compute as 40%, but if you are willing to pay $4 per call option then the IV must be higher, perhaps it computes as 45%. This effect is most apparent around earnings because there is a higher demand for options.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for this :)", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "Maybe a big drop coming tomorrow.

It was the big banks & auto companies who got the bailout.\n\nExactly.  But because it didn't happen then this built a lot of social pressure, and a very palatal sense of \"if this happens again I will allow the same response only over my dead body.\"  I could certainly be wrong about the final result, but I assure you unlike 07–08 there will be a huge social uprising when .gov trys to bail out things like banks and not the little people.  The little people may not win, but you will see them fight and leverage political pressure and maybe even physical violence at pretty significant levels unlike you did in 07-08.  07-08 taught them what happens if they don't get active and take control in the next downturn.\n\nThere are already a few dem candidates promising to cancel their student debts ($1.5 trillion) now.  Are these candidates serious?  Maybe, maybe not.  Will these candidates get elected?  Probably not without another recession or major event.  The point is we are already seeing the pressure and impetus for things like debt cancellation emerge unlike we have before so the next recession will cause things like this to come to the fore very much in contrast to 07-08 when it wasn't really on most peoples radar let alone fairly main stream candidates lips.\n\n> Millennials will have difficulty getting a job due to boomers not retiring cause…they won’t have the money to retire.\n\nWhich is what they did in 07-08, but now the boomers are a decade older.  For increasingly many of them their increased decrepitude and in some cases burgeoning senility are now on display like never before.  When jobs get tight again the boomers will try to hold dear life again to their jobs, but the appeal of keeping many of them on relative to younger less decrepit and senile individuals is now much lower than it was ten years ago.
