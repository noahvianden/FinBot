I also agree it is wrong and the chess analogy seems sufficient to me to show the intuition is busted. However even people who see it our way also have dumb intuitions and one of those I think is the belief that current ai is remotely close to human. Elon thinks autonomy is near term solvable and that it is a narrow problem more similar to chess, and I wager he is wrong about that. Current ai is still far closer to a system that memorizes examples with a very rudimentary ability to handle novelty outside of those exact examples. It basically just finds the closest memorized samples and averages them. But the more complicated the world the larger these gaps are and more shockingly incorrect that gap between examples can be. Humans are fundamentally lousy about intuitions of multidimensionality.
