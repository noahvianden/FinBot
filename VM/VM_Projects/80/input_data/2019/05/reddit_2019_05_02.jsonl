The tech isn't there yet. On a track or in specific settings, it can get pretty close, but there's one monumental hurdle. (See 2)\n\n2. Weather. There's a reason why self-driving taxis are being tested out in lowland Arizona. Reliable clear skies, very little rain, little to no fog. Cameras, lidar, whatever mix of the two you want to use are next to worthless in heavy rain and completely worthless in snow. The amount of technology needed to get around that is staggering.\n\n3. Cost. Say we reach the day when we have the all-weather tech ready to go. How much more will it cost than the current camera/lidar systems currently in cars? A fucking lot, at least at first. So once the issues with weather are solved, the cost of that tech needs to come down to where it's viable in an affordable car. That's going to take many additional years. I've seen features dumped from upcoming models because the cost for a single new part.\n\n4. Roads. Pay attention to the road markings on your commute. They're not going to be perfect, and might be completely missing in some spots. That's a problem because those are literally the most important feature that all semi-autonomous cars rely on. This is why any car offering those features only advises you to use them on highways with clear markings. No one is directing you to use these features on residential streets. What happens when there is road construction? Repavement? Lane repainting? Human intervention. Which brings me to the last point.\n\n5. New regulations. You're never going to ride in the backseat of a car driving itself because the system will never be foolproof. A driver will always be required to sit behind the wheel in case of an emergency, even if it's just a glitch of the car's system. When it comes to taxis, you're going to have to pay someone to be ready to jump in and save lives if needed. Driverless taxis are never going to happen.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'd love to live in a Minority Report style track world, but even Tom Cruise had to drive his car on city streets.", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "Currently, Tesla‚Äôs autopilot tries to run cars into medians and cars should be sold with bumper stickers saying ‚Äúwill brake for overpasses.‚Äù  Yet somehow in less than 20 months, there will be cars that so are so good at driving themselves that they won‚Äôt even need a emergency backup drivers.
