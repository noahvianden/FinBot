But Tesla doesn't even need to have an \"unusually successful\" auto insurance business - at a minimum it needs to pay for itself by enabling additional purchases of Tesla vehicles (by providing better insurance rates) - a much lower bar to meet. And just as the existence of Tesla has pressured other auto makers to accelerate their own development of electric vehicles, a viable Tesla auto insurance service could pressure other insurance companies to offer more reasonable rates to Tesla owners.\n\nBuffett is an expert in insurance, and when he says it's \"not an easy business at all\", it's worth paying attention. To survive financially, an auto insurer must do good underwriting, find an effective way to make money on the \"float\", make the right decisions regarding reinsurance, and so on. Every insurance company has its own \"secret sauce\" of how to weigh the various risk factors for each customer - and it's not just the driving statistics - geographic location, driver age and marital status, even credit rating and other factors are statistically correlated with accident rates. Hopefully Tesla has buy-in from people/companies with the expertise and resources to get Tesla insurance going - look forward to learning more when Tesla makes their official announcement.\n\nBottom line: Buffett doesn't consider the planned Tesla auto insurance a threat to GEICO, which makes sense. But he also doesn't say Tesla insurance won't be able to meet its objectives. He acknowledges that \"telematics\" (collecting information on the performance of driver and vehicle) does provide a benefit, though he may be underestimating the amount and quality of data Tesla can collect. And on the second question, he acknowledges that the online vehicle sales model such as Tesla's will cut into the business of traditional dealerships.\n\nIt's interesting that Tesla is including Autopilot on all new cars, and downloading safety features such as the recent lane change warning/avoidance, *before* booting up the insurance company - fewer accidents enables lower insurance premiums. And it is likely that continued monitoring of the Tesla fleet will lead to further identification of hardware and software changes to improve safety - a capability not directly available to other insurance companies.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "The amount of data an insurance company has on calculating risk vs what Tesla has is 1000x more info no exaggerating.

It could auto adjust your insurance every day, eg weather is bad, so it will cost you 5 dollars to start your car today, tomorrow $1.  \n\nAll a trad insurance companies knows is how many claims or speeding tickets in the last 3 years, ur age, how many miles.

Tesla will even have the opportunity to find out how much certain driving behaviors affect accident rates. For example, many people intuitively feel that people who habitually tailgate the car in front of them or constantly weave side to side in the lane are more likely to have accidents - Tesla can collect data (if they want to) to actually quantify the risks, and charge insurance rates accordingly. They might even give the insurance customer an opportunity to ask \"how can I lower my insurance rate?\", and provide a list to them, for example \"tailgate less, use your lane change/turn indicator more, drive slower on wet roads\", etc.\n\nTesla may also give discounts for people who use Autopilot / FSD more of the time.\n\nWarren Buffett has been commenting for years that self-driving cars will eventually come, and when they are safer than human drivers it will be good for society but will hurt the auto insurance companies - fortunately for him, Berkshire Hathaway has many businesses in addition to auto insurance.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "I know it's like the \"legendary buffet\" but his arguments against an auto company doing insurance are pretty sad.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "It wasn't an argument, just some rhetoric, he wasn't saying he believed that *because* of the wordplay.\n\nThat said, I very much disagree with him.
