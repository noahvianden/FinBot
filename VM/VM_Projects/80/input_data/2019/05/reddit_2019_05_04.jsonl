B) You are working with the assumption that Tesla will get a large amount cheaper and at the same time Tesla will get massively profitable. You also work with the assumption that this is guaranteed. It is not. C) the bear case explicitly says self driving tech isn't achieved. That's why it's the bear case. If self driving tech isn't achieved, Tesla won't have self driving tech.\n\nIf you don't understand any of the above do let me know and I will happily explain, but a TLDR is that you seem to be working with the logic that Tesla will be successful, because if the events occur that Tesla require in order to be successful then Tesla will be successful. That presents a best case scenario, not as being discussed here a bear scenario and if that's how things worked every company would be guaranteed success and exponential growth forever.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Dude, stop killing the premiums for the calls I want to sell next week.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "But Tesla is already reaping the success of the exponential growth from cost reductions.

Unfortunately in self driving they lag behind almost all the big competitors (Not sure where you've got the idea from that they are miles ahead of competitors, happy to concede that I'm wrong if you have some sort of non-public or insider information as I'm just basing this on articles/numbers available online). That's not to say that they might still luck out, their methods of using customer's as guinea pigs could turn out to be a stroke of genius that catches up all the lost ground, but they need something to happen, and they need it quickly.\n\nWhat it comes down to, unfortunately is that success in the past in electric cars isn't a gaurentee in the future and in self driving technology.\n\nAs for the rest, the Asian especially the Chinese market is notoriously difficult to conquer.
