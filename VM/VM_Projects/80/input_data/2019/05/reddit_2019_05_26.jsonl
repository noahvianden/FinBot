He lives in Seattle so he sees lots of Teslas all around. **The FUD was ultimately too much for him along with the weakness of the stock. He is totally convinced that Tesla is doomed at this point. Too much debt, Elon's unstable and you can't trust him, and of course, demand looks like a problem already.** I decided not to try to persuade him to keep his stock at this point. I feel a little guilty about it actually. He feels better just getting rid of a loser in his portfolio. I think he's right to jettison a stock that he has low conviction in. **I'm sure he's got a lot of company selling TSLA on this huge drop.

However, I don't expect Model X to be affected much at all.\n\nModel X is a mid-sized Crossover.  People buy it because they want a high seating position, ease of entry to seats, a 2nd row with maximum comfort, and maximum cargo space.  In the Model X, 2nd row passengers have plenty of leg support.  In Model 3, the rear seat is too low for adults to sit comfortably on longer trips.  Entry and exit from Model 3 is also noticeably more difficult than it is from Model X.  A person who wants what the Model X offers, is probably not going find the Model 3 satisfactory.

I suspect that they were low on motor and suspension parts, so they chose to concentrate on building higher margin 100 kWh and 100 kWh Performance S and X during Q1. \n\nThe next few quarters will test this hypothesis.

It's unfortunate that it negatively impacted S/X sales.  \n\nOn a positive note, it IS better that Tesla cannibalized their own sales than someone else doing it.

Investor confidence does not come because you excite them about what you *will do*. Investor confidence comes from *reliably delivering in promises you have already made*.  And specifically when it comes to money, the element of *time* is a crucial part of those promises and in earning investor confidence.\n\nThink about if your boss was promising you a promotion and a raise after 12 months. Then let’s say that 12 became 18 and became 30 months before you finally got your raise. I’m sure you would be happy to have gotten the promotion. And the delay may not have even been the fault of your boss. But when he/she tells you that your next promotion is coming in 12 months, wouldn’t you want to wait for it to actually come before you go and buy a bigger house?\n\nThe number of broken promises that have been made by TSLA and Musk are plentiful — most especially when it comes to the “time element” in Musk’s statements. I am not in the camp that believes that Musk is “lying”. You aren’t lying jf you believe your statement is true.\n\nBut investors believe that while Musk may not be lying, they are coming to the realization that his forward-looking statements are not reliable, especially when it comes to time and timing. \n\nSo when the news says there is no demand, and TSLA says, “don’t worry, there is demand”...Musk’s inability to be reliable with regards to numbers and time commitments has shifted the burden on to Tesla to show us the demand.\n\nThere are a lot of ways they could do this if they choose. They could make their reservation and sales data readily available more frequently and in a more transparent way. Or they could stay silent and just show us the demand over the next 2-3 quarters by increasing sales and — especially — increasing pricing along with increasing sales.\n\nBut until investors see more concrete results, they are not willing to just accept Musk’s statements as fact.
