Everything he does has a long-term purpose to it.\n\nJust as one simple example- he chose to put the Amazon HQ in Seattle because he wanted to minimize the number of customers who would have to pay sales tax on his products, unlike many other online retailers who put their HQ in SoCal to be with the tech crowd, which meant they had physical presence and an obligation to charge sales tax in the biggest state in the country.\n\nAmazon has positioned itself as the #1 player in e commerce, the #1 player in cloud, a major player in the tablet and smart devices market, a rapidly growing force in the ads space, and is now threatening to get into the healthcare industry. No company, not even the other FAANG ones, has both that level of diversification and that level of market dominance.\n\nPeople have been calling Amazon's stock overvalued for years (heck, they even mention that in \"The Everything Store\", and that book came out in 2013), yet their stock is up almost 500&#37; since then. Clearly, they are matching the hefty growth expectations put on them, and outpacing it.\n\nLook at the last quarter. They had EPS estimates of $1.26, and they demolished it at $3.27. Their advertising business grew by 139&#37;, and their AWS sales grew by 49&#37;...and AWS as a service is 7 years old.\n\nThis company spent 2 decades investing in its own infrastructure and claiming market share in the fastest growing industries in this country, and now that they are finally starting to focus on revenues, they are gonna leave everyone else in the dust. Mark my words.\n\nMicrosoft- \n\nThe diversification of Amazon, albeit with less market domination, but in exchange you get a more down-to-earth valuation and a dividend. Azure is the only real competitor to AWS at the moment, and I have personally observed, as someone in IT, that many companies are intimidated by Amazon and therefore use Azure simply to avoid supporting the enemy. A slower growth stock, but an excellent and safe long term pick. \n\nUnitedHealth Group- \n\nI've learned from personal experience that UnitedHealth Group, and particularly its Optum division, simply do not give a fuck about their employees. They only care about the bottom line. I've never heard executives so fixated on shareholders in my life. \n\n They are easily the biggest company in the health insurance space, and they've pretty much become the Amazon of their industry (ruthless, fixated on long term growth, obsessed with data and with the customer). They aren't going anywhere but up, unless Amazon itself is able to disrupt that industry and de-throne them. \n\nWalt Disney- \n\nFrankly, Disney is insanely undervalued right now. Their cultural significance alone gives me faith they will have a bright future. This is a company that has essentially conquered the movie industry (they had 9 of the top 10 highest grossing movies last year).  It looks like they are gonna acquire Fox now, further solidifying the monopoly they have on superheroes and on entertainment related IP's. They hope to exploit their powerful IP's with a Netflix-like service in the coming years, which will likely be a smash hit. Their theme parks will continue to do well, as they always have. The only issue nipping at their heels right now is the fact that ESPN is dying. Once they successfully downscale ESPN into a web based platform for sports news, they will be able to kick back and enjoy their moat over the entire entertainment industry. \n\nJD- \n\nEasily the most controversial stock on my list. As someone who clearly is obsessed with Amazon, it should come as no surprise that I also love their Chinese counterpart. Their revenue growth is impressive, they own all their own infrastructure, and they have the most market share in e-commerce...in the fastest growing economy on the planet. I see this stock as a gamble, but I wouldn't be surprised if it outperforms all the others in the long term. They have backing from Google and Tencent, its unlikely they are gonna collapse tomorrow.

That's borderline penny stock volatile. \n\nThough I agree Disney is undervalued...it always has and always will be. Just like Coke. You and everyone else can keep telling yourself it's a great long term hold because of the money Disney keeps making year after year and their good future prospects...but their stock will never catch up and always disappoints. It's literally been one of the most disappointing major stocks there's been in the last 2 years. Even last year with the all the good upcoming news and movies they released, the stock went up about 2% for the year while the indexes were 22% or more.

Chinese stocks in general can be extremely volatile and sketchy, and I know there are rumors that many Chinese companies cook their books. Their economy is on fire, but it isn't exactly stable. \n\nPersonally, I feel like the upside potential of JD outweighs the downside, and they really do look like a young Amazon in terms of growth rate and technology. They are heavily investing in their own infrastructure, and even put Amazon to shame in some areas (they are way ahead of Amazon in terms of drone based delivery, for example).  Google began a partnership with them and invested $550 million into JD a few months ago, and that really felt like validation to me personally. Yes, they could crash and burn, unlike any of the other company on my list. However, they could just as easily outperform every other stock on the list combined. I'll take those odds. \n\nI guess it really boils down to risk tolerance. I'm generally ok with more risk when 3 of my picks (Microsoft, UnitedHealth, and Disney) are already serving as anchors for my portfolio. \n\nHowever, for people with lower risk tolerance, 2 good options would either be high dividend telecom companies (AT&T and Verizon come to mind), or a financial services company like Visa or Mastercard. \n\nAT&T and Verizon both pay a healthy dividend, have long term stability, and see a lot of potential upside from 5G coming out soon. The only problem is that their charts are pretty ugly, just like JD. AT&T and Verizon will randomly lose 10&#37; of their value...like 5 times a year.
