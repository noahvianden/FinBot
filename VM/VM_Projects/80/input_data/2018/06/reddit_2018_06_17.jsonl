Any article framing Tesla as there being some obvious, pending doom is silly and mostly FUD.\n\nIf even half of CURRENT Tesla Model 3 reservations pay the MINIMUM of $35,000 for their car (which is the last model Tesla will be producing in order to focus on profit margins in the nearterm), and Tesla has a 10% profit margin on each vehicle, then they will be out of debt and actually have about 3x as much cash on hand than they do now.\n\nAverage price of current Model 3 is closer to $50,000. At the target production rate of 5,000 / wk, which Tesla is getting increasingly close to, they will be grossing $250,000,000 / wk. of which nearly 10% is likely profit. So you have $25 MIL / wk in profits times over a year of backlogged Tesla orders gives you $13 BIL in profits, which is what Tesla needs to be entirely out of debt and profitable for a year. They will likely be cashflow positive and trending in this direction before the end of the year for sure.\n\nTesla continues to lose money not only because of the Tesla Model 3 rampup but because of constant innovations, which burn cash, but are intelligent and productive innovations (or at least trending in the right direction long-term).

Their combined X/S deliveries were 7,000 fewer than Q4 of last year, and 3,000 fewer than the same quarter (17Q1) last year. At the same time, Model 3 deliveries increased 7,000 from Q4 of last year.\n\nSo if we assume for a second that everything is a-okay with the Model 3 ramp, you're still giving up 7,000+ sales of your premium $100,000 product with a positive margin for a $50,000 product with a negative margin. *Even if* they somehow hit their goal of positive margins on the 3 (which is, again, a big *if*), they'd need to more than *double* the deliveries of the 3 just to tread water.

So you have a stagnant revenue stream because while you're increasing volume (slower than expected), you're doing it on smaller margins. On the other hand, your debt is fixed--they're not going to take a haircut because of problems on the Model 3 line. Usually, this wouldn't be impossible, you could just refinance the debt by issuing new bonds, but they can't really do that now because of their drop in ratings unless they want to pay obscene rates on it. It's no coincidence that their creditors asked for more collateral, and they had to put their Freemont factory on the line.

If Tesla fails, there will probably be some small suppliers that may also fail, but all things considered, the damage would be fairly contained. If a national bank fails, not only do you have the banks going belly up, but everyone that holds deposits at the bank has to be reimbursed through FDIC. Even that wouldn't be a bit deal, but in 2008, we had a situation where we had multiple major national banks all failing simultaneously. \n\nAs for the thing about Solar City, I'm not sure what the details of the acquisition were, so I can't answer that. However, there's really no get out of jail free card that he could have gotten--SC had debts and the creditors aren't going to give up what they're owed because of a merger. People speculate that the only reason for the acquisition was to save SC from going under, which kind of seems true at this point. They haven't really combined the businesses in any meaningful way and nothing about one company has given the other company any kind of economies of scale, so there doesn't seem to be a clear benefit other than saving your cousin's company.
