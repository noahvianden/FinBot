It's even harder to keep it. Makes sense. The human brain evolved to run from tigers, hunt, gather and have sex. Financial risk management with sudden windfalls in a complex economy breaks the software. \n\nYes you fucked up but in the same way a 2nd grader fucks up by drawing outside the lines. I guess you could blame them for not being in the top 1% of 2nd grade drawers who draw perfectly, but that's pretty lacking in context and cruel. Whoops. You're not a superhuman with perfect discipline that operates on pure logic and perfect discipline. It'd be absurd and cruel to beat yourself up, given the tools you've got to work with. Why not also beat yourself up for blowing the opportunity to buy and hold AMZN in 1999? The would've could've should've never ends. \n\nRemember 2008? Remember all those people who lost everything in the housing crash. Many were rich on paper a couple years before? Houses are public and their loss cannot be hidden. Those people got hurt bad but they were in large company. They still lost everything. Many in the negative in states where the bank can sue for any still owed after foreclosure auction. \n\nThey had pop culture telling them it wasn't their fault for taking silly risks. No it was the banks. The only difference is they don't feel as isolated and had someone easy to blame. But you shouldn't feel isolated. \n\nYou logically know you're not the only person to lose a fortune in the market. You just don't get the pop culture misery loves company to go with it. Shit, XIV just blew up. There are probably thousands of people just like you from that one event alone. \n\nDon't forget about every attempted restaurant or small business owner. Those people all personally guarantee everything and fail like 90% of the time losing everything with maxed out credit card debt. Do you ever hear about them? Nope you only hear about the minority of success stories. \n\nWe can't leave out the 2000 tech bubble that wiped out many regular people's fortunes. WTF was the average person to make of this new internet economy, online trading and everyone saying they're stupid for not getting in on it. You can't imagine how many doctors and other smart professionals lost their life savings, which they had toil for years to accumulate. Should they beat themselves up? I don't think so beyond just enough to learn the lesson. The core mistake was the epitome of an inherent human weakness. \n\nYou say you're in your 40s like you're screwed. That makes no sense. You're at the halfway point in life. With future medical tech you could be at more like the 1/3 point. You could literally start over now and still have 20 or 30 good working years ahead. That's 20 or 30 years most people your age will also have to work BTW. They have no choice. They just never had the emotional baggage of a crazy option account at one point. \n\nYou're older and wiser now but you're not so old you're decrepit. You're arguably in the sweet spot to start over and get earning. Or make a modest living doing whatever you want. Point is youre closer to the beginning than the end. Don't fool yourself into this bullshit that you blew it right before the end. This is not the end unless you have terminal cancer. \n\nOh ya. Thousands of people today just like you will be told by their doctors that they have terminal cancer. They'll be dead in a box within a year if theyre lucky. Their kids' future is unknown, maybe to be raised by some step father their wife will remarry. Hopefully he is kind to their kids and doesn't abuse them. The stats aren't great. Hopefully the kids and window will find a way to make ends meet. Some perspective?\n\nYa you probably should go to GA or something, but realize your impulse to gamble is separate from how loathsome you should feel about your track record so far. Your track record despite the ups and downs doesn't put you in much different destination than lots of people. It's like you all took buses to the same place. It's just your off bus took the looney roller coaster route. \n\nLots of baby boomers are broke and in bad shape. Worse than you and with major health problems. They don't get 20 extra years of medical technology development. They'd trade a couple of limbs to have an opportunity to start over at your age. \n\nGo easy on yourself. You need time to put this in proper perspective. You're like a heart broken teenager that is severaly depressed from his first breakup.

Look at the board and investors of Theranos. They were responsible for stewarding the hundreds of millions. They were some of the smartest people on Earth and most successful people in every field. Yet they toched 100s of millions on a snake oil story. A girl with literally nothing real. Just a bullshit story. There were plenty of warning signs in hindsight. You think 1 million loss is bad? Try several hundred million. At least you bet on something real. They bet on smoke. Remember all the people wiped out at retirement age by Madhoff? How could they be so stupid to believe a guy had consistent perfect returns and it was no biggie that he was hiding his books? The examples never end. If you beat yourself up over how you should've known better then you might as well beat yourself every day for being human. People far smarter than you have lost far more than you. \n\nI know that even when you accept 20/20 hindsight self loathing is nonsensical, you have to deal with the problem of how to start over at 40. But again this is based on the pop culture bullshit notion that most sensible people are situated at 40 and near retirement. It's bullshit. Tech and globalism are putting millions of people in your same position of wondering how to monetize their experience which now seems worthless. \n\nBut why would 40 be too late to literally start over? There are skills you could learn within 2 years that are valuable. They'd certainly pay better and have a better future value than teaching English in China. But even using that example, being fluent in Mandarin is a valuable skill. Or pick another language not so volatile with politics. \n\nSince you talk about picking up and moving to China I'm assuming you're unattached. That is literally the single biggest barrier people have when it comes to starting over. Why not embrace the opportunity for a new start, which you uniquely have?\n\nThe idea that your experience is worthless is also not true. Yes it's true no one will hire you tommorow bases solely on your options trading record. But you understand derivatives which is a pretty fucking esoteric subject. Combine with another unique skill and there is value there.\n\nAbout the checks you sent to people, get over it and so should they. No business only grows. No business never has layoffs or has to cut back. That's the nature of our volatile world. If every other business is supposed to cut off money to employees, vendors and charities when the business takes a downturn, or their portfolio takes a hit, why are you supposed to be the only business on Earth with 100% consistency forever? Do you realize how ridiculous of a setup to fail expectation for yourself that is? If others expect that unrealistic performance from you and don't get it, then that is their problem. Not yours. Theyre like kids who don't understand there will be fewer presents or none this year for Christmas because the factor closed down. Fair enough to be disappointed but it's unreasonable to place blame. That's the nature of our up and down system. The only guy able to produce perfectly consistent earnings and portfolio performance was Bernie Madhoff. They expect that from you? This is their problem. \n\nThe fact that you lost your money in a bull market is irrelevant. Honestly it has nothing to do with anything. Businesses go bankrupt all the time in bull markets. Besides you say it like \"the bull market\" like there is only one. There are many markets. Some like China or commodities or crypto are in deep bear markets. Having lost money on a bull market is veiled version of 20/20 hindsight self loathing. You only know certain markets went up while others went down in hindsight. It was literally impossible to predict. Now you want to beat yourself up for not perfectly profiting from a trend you had no way to predict with certainty. All of the counter factuals will never be discussed in pop culture. All of the people HODLING QQQ on max margin will never beat themselves up for losing it all.
