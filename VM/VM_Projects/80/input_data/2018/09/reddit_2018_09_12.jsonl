When you are speccing out servers for a deployment, you typically need to get multiple quotes, create a purchase orders, get it approved by purchasing, etc. Thats not even including the back and forth about how much it costs, requoting to hit the budget, and so on.

And again, to even get the hardware to test requires quotes, PO's, approval, etc. Basically, all the corporate red tape makes things take forever.         \n\nLike any sector, in IT There are plenty of brand loyalists who will stick with Intel solely because \"It's what we've always used\".

Frankly I only put 30% of my account in AMD and the position has grown to beyond 50%. Its just screaming so much faster than the rest of the market.\n\nBut on fundamentals: the thing to understand here is were seeing a secular shift in the processor space. For the first time AMD has leads in basically every area but IPC. Density, efficiency, price...all are better on AMD than Intel. AMD is also about to leapfrog Intel on process node and Intel, with their delayed 10nm, wont catch up until late 2019. With that we very well may see an IPC win for AMD as well. \n\nLook, AMD is saying they hope to hit double-digit penetration (so 10%) of the datacenter market by 2h 2019. Intel hopes they can ***contain*** AMD at 20%. Taking the middle of that road you have AMD doubling their revenue with 60% margin product while Intel looses a big chunk of their biggest margin area and are forced to start competing on price.\n\nAnd here is the all-time kicker: AMD's design approach is much much much more efficient from a manufacturing perspective. I cant do nearly as good of a job of explaining it as Jim at AdoredTV (www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucMQermB9wQ). Bottom line, AMD is going to be better positioned because of the design of Ryzen/Epyc to compete on cost than Intel with their monolithic core designs. They will also be able to be financially profitable at lower process nodes than Intel can possibly manage at the same core counts.\n\nIntel needs a massive change in how it approaches CPU design or they will start falling way behind AMD. They already are behind on all the key metrics for datacenter, and AMD is about to release their 2nd generation of that product which will be even better.\n\nWith AMD fundamentally outpacing Intel they will take market share by the truckload, and have all of the revenue and profitability benefits that come with that.", "score": 21, "replies": [{"body": "Betting against intel is something I would never do.
