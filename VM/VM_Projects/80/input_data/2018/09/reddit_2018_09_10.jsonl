This implies that the company has a lot of room to grow locally and internationally. \n\nThe company is also significantly growing the number of Amazon Go stores in the US. This development offers retail growth potential beyond that of online retail. \n\nLooking at other areas of business, Amazon's AWS offering is clearly a leader in the cloud technology space and has solidified its position in a highly capital intensive business with few strong competitors and a fast growing market. The rise of IoT, Artificial intelligence and autonomy is causing exponential growth in the demand for data storage and analysis with cloud computing services as the key bemeficiaries. This arm of the business definitely will definitely be a key driver for growth in the future.\n\nWhen it comes to content, Amazon is lagging behind Netflix in terms of content and user experience, but it's definitely putting up a fight and Amazon Prime overall has proven to be hugely successful. As chord cutting continues and streaming takes over as the primary medium for video consumption Amazon will also be well positioned to capitalize on the opportunity. A much more promising Amazon subsidiary that's shaking up the online video streaming industry is Twitch, a video streaming platform focused on e-sports. The massive growth in this space led by games such as Fortinite, PUBG and League of Legends  has made Twitch a highly successful investment. \n\nAmazon is currently exploring multiple sectors and markets to penetrate in the near future. The company has built investor confidence over the past twenty years and has managed to maintain its status as a growth based investment even as its market cap hits 1 trillion USD. Also, it's newly achieved market cap will probably lead many, like yourself, to doubt it's ability to grow beyond this number. This might possibly lead to a slight sell off and a better valuation for new investors. \n\nKeep in mind 1 trillion is just a number and while it's not something to ignore it's definitely not something to base investment decisions on. \n\n", "score": 132, "replies": [{"body": "Your last point essentially agrees with OP in that amazon’s current valuation is excessive, and is almost certainly due for a correction. \n\nAdditionally, no matter how you stretch or portray it, e commerce, as amazon does it, is not a very profitable endeavor, and the only reason amazon is the company it is today is due to AWS. An investor todsy needs to believe that AWS will continue to grow at roughly the same pace it is currently at (40% yoy) to maintain its current valuation. All of the new ventures are speculative, lower margin endeavors, that should not be rewarded so excessively yet (amazon starts and fails at plenty of projects). \n\nI also, personally, believe there is material risk of regulation for amazon on a monopolistic level. It is no secret that aws subsidizes the other divisions at amazon, and intentionally operating at a loss in order to put your competitors out of business is against the law. Forays into the Brick and Mortar grocery space will exacerbate these issues, as people need food, and grocery stores going out of business will be a major red-flag for politicians. \n\nI like amazon as a company, and use a metric ass load of their services, but I think the company is both spread out too think, and far too richly valued for new money right now.

{"title": "Strong market rally coming, due diligence inside (TA)", "selftext": "My computer crashed while making this post so I will keep this rewrite brief.\n\nI anticipate a strong market rally coming, probably Monday - it is my belief that this latest recession was profit taking. However it is also my belief that this rally may be very aggressive but short lived.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Nasdaq 100**\n\nNasdaq saw the most drawdown out of all the indices that I will cover.\n\nThe first chart below is the /NQ on a daily time frame. One can see that price broke down out of this uptrending channel that began forming in April of 2018. This breakdown of the channel support is a big bearish event that was supposed to happen the week prior but the market was juiced up instead once more.\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/Es9wClW.png](https://i.imgur.com/Es9wClW.png)\n\nIn any case, a real market sell off will not happen until we have a rejection on the pullback to the channel support. See this next image to see what I mean.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/Ol5NDEd](https://imgur.com/a/Ol5NDEd)\n\nThe real reason I am bullish short term is due to the 1 hour chart. One can see that there is a clear downtrending resistance line taking shape from where the sell off first started. We can see that a strong base has formed at the 7400 level and more importantly we had a massive engulfing hourly candle on Friday at 9 am. I believe we would have rallied last Friday but that Trump tweet at lunch threw a wrench in the market manipulators’ plans.\n\nIt appears now that price is breaking out again in the overnight session but we won’t trust it completely until we see a successful throwback to the resistance line followed by a bounce.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/1wSmEP4](https://imgur.com/a/1wSmEP4)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**S&P 500**\n\nThe S&P 500 has the strongest bullish reasoning. Take a look at this chart below. What we saw in the last week was a market rally that broke above former ATH (all time highs) established back in January of 2018. You can even see that the market first rejected breaking over the ATH on August 21, 2018 and it wasn’t until Friday August 24 and Monday August 27th that they juiced the market up and over on huge thrust.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/090IlNr](https://imgur.com/a/090IlNr)\n\nWhat we have now is price performing a throwback to the resistance (i.e., the ATH) to test for latent supply. The test here is pretty much successful and we should see a reversal up. The second bullish reason is that we have a falling/descending wedge in an uptrend – these patterns tend to break to the upside. Take a look at this next chart to see this descending wedge in all its glory.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/WkLYqOV](https://imgur.com/a/WkLYqOV)\n\nFor the third bullish reason, take a look at the daily candles on the S&P500. Notice the large candle body wicks – the wicks are >= half the candle body. This tells me that smart money was absorbing the selling and that the majority of the selling was trapped late bulls and profit takers. In other words, there is no conviction from the bears here.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/WTmvIdt](https://imgur.com/a/WTmvIdt)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Russel 2000**\n\nThe Russel 2000 has been a very strong index and at at times rally front runner. It has the same bullish reasoning behind it as the S&P500 – that is, ATH retest and absorbtion of the selling. The one difference is that in the shorter time frame (hourly – daily), price is in a downtrending channel. Expect it to break to the upside and again go long once the channel resistance is retested as support (see the second Russel 2000 chart for that trade plan).\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/knBbdkY](https://imgur.com/a/knBbdkY)\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/vp4RtCS](https://imgur.com/a/vp4RtCS)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**DJIA**\n\nI won’t spend much time on this one expect to say that this index did not even budge and has pretty much shaken on this recession. Bearishly though, it does indeed have yet to test and break its ATH from January of 2018.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/Lvc0avm](https://imgur.com/a/Lvc0avm)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR**\n\nIndices look bullish, the recession was profit taking and not actually proof of bearish conviction. Expect a strong but possibly short lived rally (i.e, dead cat bounce) on Monday cause I am.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Monday Sep 9 Update**\n\nI took a bit of a dicking this morning got caught in that sell off but recovered my losses.\n\nHere is an update on the S&P 500 - descending wedge broke to the upside, price is now back to the breakout area for a retest before the real rally up.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/rSCHjeh](https://imgur.com/a/rSCHjeh)\n\nHere is the Nasdaq 100 - we can see that the sell off reversed right on the resistance line. This was a throwback retest and it appears to have held. I made the mistake of front running the retest by going long and was underwater for a bit. We may still get one more test, but this line is now support and should be providing some easy RR long trades/bounces.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/DHqzFZi](https://imgur.com/a/DHqzFZi)\n\nIntraday wise, /NQ is in a bit of a precarious spot could rally or could tank hard here. I will wait for another sell off / retest before going long.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/2oKRoDo](https://imgur.com/a/2oKRoDo)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Tuesday Sep 10 Update around 2 pm EST**\n\nS&P500 made antother retest of the descending wedge and launched a really powerful rally. Take a look below. If the S&P500 does sell off, I expect the covering to happen where those black arrows are.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nf15awosgnl11.png?width=1338&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d1268c7309b9eb0d521676df918665505ff206c\n\n**Nasdaq 100**\n\nPennant break to the upside, led to massive rally. Look how it found resistance right on the former channel break down. Price will probably retest the pennant resistance turned support before giving way to another rally.\n\nNotice how they broke the pennant down before market open and then immediately reversed it up? **That is how big rallies are launched, by fakeouts - think of it like judo, using trapped bears' momentum against them!**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3uckyupnenl11.png?width=1169&format=png&auto=webp&s=352f54718f3b99099de0fde41410c03ca187f014\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere is the channel I was talking about. Notice how price is tapping on that support? That is where I went short earlier today for a quick scalp.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7tfypl53fnl11.png?width=1340&format=png&auto=webp&s=2782e21575497882ab389a7ac92a8c5767b33321\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI missed the easy rally this morning cause I was late so I didn't want to chase, hence why I waited to short at resistance instead. Proof below.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x50qfivffnl11.png?width=1432&format=png&auto=webp&s=bcb72a2ff6e4f779b68ce87db1e92f3bcee6dfca\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Russell 2000**\n\nHere is the Russell 2000 - notice again, we have the same type of retest on the breakout. Price found support and will probably push up from here on the channel resistance turned support.
