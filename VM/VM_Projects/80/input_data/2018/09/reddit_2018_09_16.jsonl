For a near-the-money put on TSLA, delta is around -0.42 (delta is positive for calls). This means that for every dollar movement downward in TSLA, the option will increase in value by about 42¬¢ (this delta can change throughout the day). For the $50 puts, delta is -0.0017, or -.17¬¢ per dollar movement in TSLA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf we do the math, we would expect the $50 put to go up 8.5¬¢ if TSLA dropped $50, all else being equal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis means our $50 put can increase in value, but it takes enormous swings in the stock's price to see an appreciable movement in the value of our option. This is because the market on the whole doesn't generally want an option whether it's $200 OTM or $250 OTM (if we're working with about 30 days to expiration on a stock that's worth only $295), either one will almost certainly expire worthless. Even if TSLA went down $50 tomorrow, it would have to go down another $195 for our put to be ITM, which isn't going to happen except in a catastrophic event.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou should also note how implied volatility (IV) affects the value of an option. Higher IV means the option price is higher. The $50 put has an IV of 221% as opposed to 58% IV on at-the-money puts for the same date. This likely means the $50 put is horribly overvalued, even at $0.12; the $50 put should only have that value if TSLA is about 4x more volatile than the rest of the option chain is making the stock out to be (i.e. the stock is volatile, but not nearly enough to warrant the value given to our $50 put).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy exactly so many options were sold at that strike is a mystery to me, but the buyer(s) are going to have a very difficult time unloading their thousands of options.
