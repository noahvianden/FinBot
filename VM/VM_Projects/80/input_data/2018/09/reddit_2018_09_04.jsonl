They will need to sell a bunch of ZEV credits to turn a profit in Q3.  \n\nThe company said they would be profitable producing 50-55k Model 3s because they also knew they would be selling a ton of ZEV credits in the quarter.

Of course we shouldn't forget about those.  Last quarter they had gross profits of -$72 million, so that takes our projected loss for the quarter up to $80 million.
