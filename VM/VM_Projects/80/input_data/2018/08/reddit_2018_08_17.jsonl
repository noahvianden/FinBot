Is any publicly listed company seriously giving them contract pricing details? Also note: they predicted AAPL iPhone sales collapse a few months ago (and we all know how truthful that turned out to be)\n   * And remember, this is an absolute bad for Micron despite the (over-time) improving cost structure of the product\n* All of the above statements, from experts at various points of the industry, align with the same story: DRAM demand is *still* increasing, shows no signs of slowing, and although prices may decline somewhat due to incoming supply ramp, costs of production are also likely to decline as well, so drops in prices do not guarantee lower margins.
