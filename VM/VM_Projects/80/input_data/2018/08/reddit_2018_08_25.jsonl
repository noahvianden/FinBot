The problem is that his success has made him feel superior.\n\nWhen we had the crisis with the kids of a football team in Thailand stuck in a flooded cave he went there to help and they wanted to make a mini submarine to save the kids. Was useless but he got a lot of PR. When he was called out on it not being helpful by an Australian dive instructor who were one of the main divers for the rescue Elon got mad and - in a now deleted tweet - states the Australian guy was a pedophile.\n\nElon dislikes short sellers a lot. When people short the Tesla stock it indicates they think it‚Äôs overvalued and should go down. Elon doesn‚Äôt like this. He had many tweets talking negatively about short sellers. His latest stunt about bringing Tesla private made a lot of short sellers lose many millions of dollars. It‚Äôs now turning into possible stock manipulation and the company (and its shareholders) now risk getting a big fine due to Elon‚Äôs stunt that some speculate was just done to hit short sellers.\n\nElon seems to have become too much of himself and seems to think he can say and do whatever he wants. He has a great vision and ambitions but this has started to be overshadowed by his personality and tendency to send out stupid tweets. If he focused less on obscure PR and stupid tweets and more on running his companies and drive the world forward I think he would be loved a lot more. He created his own target on his back.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "I'm with you on most of that, but did he really hurt any short sellers?

If they have little capital it might  be hard to go back into the positions to benefit from when the stock goes down again.
