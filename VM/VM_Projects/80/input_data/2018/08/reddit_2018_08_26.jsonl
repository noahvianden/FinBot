{"title": "Notes from Micron talk from a Senior Fellow at UC Berkeley", "selftext": "I am a student of UC Berkeley and I attended a talk from Micron at the university (if mods want proof I can give). Obviously, I have calls and shares at the company like y'all, so I took lots of notes during the presentation and hope you guys will enjoy. TLDR at bottom.\n\n* Out of 35000 Employees there are 4 Senior Fellows. The presenter was a Senior Fellow.\n* Interns say that their work is super impactful to the company.\n* Sanjay and university recruiter are from UCB and favor the university. More nerds = better company\n* Moving up hierarchy to memory sub systems. 7th largest semiconductor. 3rd largest memory.\n* Micron provides infrastructure to big companies like Apple or Google to store and pull data. Data is currency of business.\n* 20,000+ patents overall.\n* Only competitor with companies and business all over the world. Samsung is in Korea. Toshiba in Japan.\n* Industry trends\n* Compute and Networking - Biggest growth is in data centers\n* Embedded - Autos using Micron memory increasingly\n* Storage - NAND flash memory displacing HDD in data centers. Mobile using DRAM and flash storage\n* 5 years ago Micron was only in memory and fast storage. Now into primary storage, software, platform.\n* 3D Xpoint, their new memory technology with Intel, has good middle between DRAM and NAND cost vs latency. It’s the newest technology after 25 years when NAND was invented.\n* Data generation increasing exponentially. For example, viewing a video makes its data go from DRAM to NAND in system then to the cloud in a data center’s DRAM then its NAND.\n* Artificial intelligence requires either in your own devices or in the cloud data centers. Cloud latency too high so self-driving cars require in device memory, which Micron makes.\n* Currently in AI cars we have ADAS technology. In 2020+ there will be autonomous driving. Senior Fellow was very bullish on this. Needs 4x storage 6x memory.\n* Google uses tensor PU; Apple uses neural PU instead of CPU GPU for AI. All these consume lots of data fast. Training and models are huge and cannot be stored purely in memory.\n* Their R&D are looking at doing processing in memory for AI. Even further is analog compute, directly on memory.\n* Qualcomm Broadcomm Apple don't manufacture silicon, while Micron makes everything from scratch. \n* NAND Flash currently at 3D NAND technology. 3 Generations. Gen 1 32 tiers. Gen 2 64 tiers. Gen 3 96 tiers.\n* Memory technology is so volatile and prices increased so much because the cyclical prices are supply demand driven. Previously, companies would invest and oversupply during high prices, driving the prices down a lot and eventually destroying multiple companies. It takes 5-10b to build a new supply factory. Nowadays manufacturers are disciplined. Do not oversupply during highs. \n* Historically there were more companies less stability. Hedge funds hedge against downturn with low Price/Earnings multiple. Now there are 4 stable companies that are not oversupplying and creating volatility. Senior Fellow thinks MU should trade at 15 P/E.\n\nTLDR: AI technology and Data centers are the future and need lots of memory. 3D Xpoint is also a technology to be bullish over. Hedge funds trade MU at a low P/E multiple because they think the industry is volatile, but Senior Fellow thinks that it has become a lot more stable and disciplined, so it should trade at a 15 P/E.", "id": "9ah9qu", "created_utc": 1535304492.0, "score": 118, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 82, "comments": [{"body": "So......8/31 $MU 90c?", "score": 94, "replies": [{"body": "8/31 $125 MU calls.

Memory usage these days is incredible. For eg, Netflix runs a production cluster having 400 Terabytes of memory.

IMO, anyone who wants to compete in streaming is going to have to compete in the infrastructure game. AMZN and GOOG are killing it on this front, and they both stand to make absurd amount of  💵💰 off the scrubs who can't/won't invest in their own hardware (looking at you AAPL). It'll be interesting to see how DIS/CMCSA handle this now that DIS is launching a streaming service while owning 2/3 of Hulu while CMCSA owns the other 1/3. I think CMCSA will expand their server networks and DIS will piggy back on that if they toss Hulu some DIS content (as opposed to going fully exclusive). Anyway, point is, all of these guys will expand their data spend bigly, especially if they plan to host/stream huge catalogs of older content. I'd be so incredibly bullish MU if China's trade war bullshit wasn't bitch slapping it every other week.

I got into Berkeley with straight As, a perfect score of 45 on the IB Diploma (you would need 12 AP courses with 5 as an equivalent), and leadership in school clubs.
