I'm expecting RDR2 to be the best selling title of the year and EA to face plant or at least disappoint with Battlefield not because its terrible but it won't be the must have Christmas game.\n\nRegarding their other marquee brands that solely rely on buying up licensing for sports leagues (or Star Wars) even FIFA & Madden die hards are starting to question those games. It doesn't mean they won't buy them this year or next and buy those ridiculous ultimate team packs or whatever they are but the lack of innovation is slowly killing even those games. Madden 18 sales have already seen a decline of 7-8% w/ pre-sale over the first 8 weeks (compared to Madden 17). However, its its hard to quote that accurately w/ digital sales figures under wraps. Again, there is a reason EA pushes micro transactions so hard.\n\nOn another note, Disney was furious with EA for Battlefront and don't think for a moment that they won't look for another publisher if EA doesn't get its act together. The mouse does not screw around w/ its IP.\n\nFinal point is that independent studios do not want to be acquired by EA anymore. They have seen what they have done to other studios:\n\n1. buy them up \n2. burn them out making games they don't want to or add/change things they hate as a money grab\n3. lay everybody off due to disappointing sales on unrealistic development cycles and shutter the \"underperforming\" studio. \n\nThis creates a situation where EA has to pay independents a premium to acquire them now or get the less creative or severely cash independents because EA are def not innovating internally and have not for years.\n\nAny independent studio would much prefer Tencent to approach them, buy a stake and then leave them alone to make the games they want to make. Tencent has gotten a reputation in the industry of where to go when you need cash with little to no interference. Holdings now include:\n\n* 5% of ATVI\n* 5% of Ubisoft\n* 100% of RIOT\n* looking to bump its stake in Bluehole (PUBG) up to 10%\n* 40% of Epic Games (Fortnite)\n* Unknown % of Discord private equity investment", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "ATVI is much bigger (and a better investment too)", "score": -2, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "I bought 1/18/19 EA calls cause I think with BF5 and Christmas so close there is bound to be micro transactions raining tendies on EA ", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "You might hit a good eps but the company shows no growth potential.
