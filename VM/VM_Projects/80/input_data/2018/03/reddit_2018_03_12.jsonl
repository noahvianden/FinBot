{"title": "I received options and made $7,000 in one week", "selftext": "I'm a college student who has been frugal for the past two years. I saw so much activity in Micron with the highest volume in any market and realized this was big. A little Idaho company could take over the Intel giant or at least a large portion of its market share. I decided I could make a decent chunk of change or die trying. I set 25 $60 calls for March 23, the day after earnings. I woke up this morning to see the positions rise 300% to my astonishment I already beat this call. Sure I could wait and still make a lot more money but (I'm a pussy/faggot) I already have close to $6,000 in other Micron positions. Really I want to thank this prestigious community for it's support.\n\n[PROOF](https://i.imgur.com/8rkTMpE.png)", "id": "83x0v8", "created_utc": 1520877750.0, "score": 128, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 70, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 151, "replies": [{"body": "I was literally in the first 3000 to sign up and I still don't have options. \n\nEdit: I got options today!
