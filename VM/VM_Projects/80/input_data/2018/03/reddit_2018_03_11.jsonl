However, the comment thread is talking about stuff like Dollar Tree. Dollar tree is for food and cheap other random odds and ends. No one who is without a job or with massive loses in a year takes their money and shops at Whole Foods, no one with massive loses during a recession goes out to buy new computer parts, or has that patio installed in their backyard; people reduce spending in a lot of ways. \n\nAlso, stores don't need much to show a massive loss in their stock price. If Whole Foods announced that in the last year sales dropped by 4% due to the current economic state, I wouldn't be holding it. That would only require 4 out of every 100 customers say to themselves \"Let's use the coupons we found for ShopRite today.\" Not go to 7Eleven to feed dinner to their children, but to downgrade one step. \n\nI understand what you are saying though, large volumes of people are not going to go from middle-class to homeless, but saying that no one would try to save money during times of economic recessions by shopping at cheaper stores or changes their shopping habits is a bit hard to swallow.\n\nI honestly don't think DollarTree will be a good stock to hold in a recession, I am more into holding bluechips and just collecting dividends during those times, but it will likely have a faster recovery period after the recession, I think it will have less downside than some other stocks. Lastly, I refuse to even refer to those staticians (like on the news or articles) as actual economists.
