It's a duplex I rent one half for $950 a month. My mortgage through my credit union (portfolio loan, so no PMI) is $935 a month. My taxes...well they suck. Like $6000 a year. Basically I pay $500 a month to live in a pretty nice place and have to fix occasional bullshit (their furnace died last month after like 13 years, my garage door broke yesterday). Maintenance on essentially 2 houses can suck, but it's not a bad gig if you can swing landlord responsibilities.\n\nEdit: By dumb shit, here are some examples:\n\n* Vacation to the Netherlands to see the Rolling Stones\n* 1000 sqft pool house they never fucking used. Full bath, living room, kitchen, bar, I believe 1 bedroom. I remember asking the kids one year (they're my age, I was a kid at the time) about how awesome it must be to camp out in the pool house all summer. They were all like, oh we never thought about sleeping in here before. Wtf?\n* Their eldest daughter got an H3 to drive to high school, which was a pretty nice car around the time they had it. Their other vehicles were a Corvette, a Sequoia, a new VW Bug and another car that I forgot, all new purchases.
