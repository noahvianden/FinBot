{"title": "Tilray Management trying hard to pump & is sweating profusely ahead of lockup expiration on 01/15", "selftext": "I'm hesitant to post this because I want you autists to buy TLRY so that I can get cheap puts, but this is just cringe:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter its recent fall from grace and below the century mark, Marijuana Darling, Tilray, has had five press releases in the last week:\n\n\" [AB InBev and Tilray Announce Research Partnership Focused on Non-Alcohol THC and CBD Beverages](https://ir.tilray.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ab-inbev-and-tilray-announce-research-partnership-focused-non)\n\nDecember 19, 2018\n\n[Tilray® Signs Global Collaboration Agreement with Leading Pharmaceutical Company](https://ir.tilray.com/news-releases/news-release-details/tilrayr-signs-global-collaboration-agreement-leading)\n\nDecember 18, 2018\n\n[Tilray® Signs Letter of Intent for Hemp-Derived CBD from the U.S. and Canada](https://ir.tilray.com/news-releases/news-release-details/tilrayr-signs-letter-intent-hemp-derived-cbd-us-and-canada)\n\nDecember 17, 2018\n\n[Tilray® Invests C$7.5M in Québec-Based Cannabis Producer ROSE Lifescience Inc.](https://ir.tilray.com/news-releases/news-release-details/tilrayr-invests-c75m-quebec-based-cannabis-producer-rose)\n\nDecember 14, 2018\n\n[Tilray® Announces International Advisory Board](https://ir.tilray.com/news-releases/news-release-details/tilrayr-announces-international-advisory-board)\n\nDecember 13, 2018\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMost recently, TLRY announced after hours today that they are partnering with Budweiser to RESEARCH MJ drinks for the Canadian market. Budweiser is providing 50 million in funding. Tilray will match that amount for a combined $100 million. The stock has jumped \\~15% AH on this news.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is laughable compared to Cronos & CGC both obtaining 1+ billion dollar investments. How exactly does Tilray plan to compete in this space with limited capital and a slower start? This deal lacks substance and conviction and is clearly a pump attempt.\n\nI'm recommending you fine fellows grab a beer and watch this shitty stock implode to IPO levels.\n\nIf the lockup doesn't do it, earnings will. $33 million dollars in sales is not CURRENTLY enough to even nearly justify a 7 billion dollar market cap. The Marijuana industry will expand, but Tilray's valuation implies that it will expand quickly, and in a manner that gives Tilray a competitive advantage over a commodity: which in itself is a bit of an oxymoron.\n\nCompanies with actual value do not do BS like this. History tends to repeat itself, and this rolling bear market - if you will - has deflated just about every 2018 IPO to its IPO levels. It's time for Tilray to go home to $17.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTilray Calendar:\n\nTilray Lockup 01/15: dramatic increase in float to occur (400%?)\n\nTilray Earnings 02/12: After hours\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*I am not a salty short.
