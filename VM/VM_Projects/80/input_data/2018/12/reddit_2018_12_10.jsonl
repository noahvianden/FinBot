Brexit is a symptom of the stagnation in domestic policy development and welfare reform, which has left working class and low income individuals revolting. Major parties (mostly UKIP) feed the line that Europe is preventing effective governing from happening - which is horseshit. No one is stopping parliament from restructuring their budget and reorganizing the NHS, or any welfare system. They are a sovereign fucking country, and if Dorito Dump has taught as anything is that a soverign country can do whatever, whenever (heck, Poland essentially stopped being a democracy in the same time frame these dingelings tried to leave the EU). The UK government has been jacking off to the sound of poor folks screaming in agony for the past 30 years, and is now too cognitively incontinent to put out the dumpster fire that is British social discourse. Brexit ensues, because the poor and disenfranchised want attention from their administration. Which they'll get, but not as quickly as the UKIP idiots are thinking (expect 10+ years).\n\nFrance, on the other hand has had a long love-hatred relationship with government, and revolution is a national bonding event. With a majority of folks employed in the public sector, any tax or reimbursement changes affect a massive amount of people, and budget restructuring has huge implications for unions, and private sector entities (who rely on the French Gov't for nearly all their logistic support) are similarly worried what their employees are going to say. Important distinction to the UK is that France is somewhat in touch with its working class, while the UK has done fuck-all to acknowledge their existence.\n\nThis comes in a EU-wide right-ward trend in politics. Don't be surprised if it turns out the protests in Paris are being supported (in material and people) by neo-nazi groups and other disruptors without a stake in actual policy making.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Note that crystallization in policy and political debates is greater than ever in Europe, which has historically benefited from strong moderate political parties.", "score": 23, "replies": [{"body": "Despite everyone saying Macron is going to do the equivalent of \"let them eat cake\" is it possible he might crackdown on the yellow jackets hard?

Police are taking them more seriously though, confiscating gas masks and using higher concentrated tear gas on mobs, plain clothes officers weeding into the ranks of protesters to make preliminary arrests, etc. Hard crackdown (i.e. deaths) are unlikely, given the French variable (revolutionary tendencies), while Macron is unlikely to yield his position on the tax (govt needs the money, cites concerns over pollution, Green concerns). Also, weakness under pressure would be a bad show for the young president who has come under repeated scrutiny for his inexperience, ties to business, and general sleaziness.
