Does the self driving car swerve to avoid the stopped car and run the risk of hitting the pedestrians or does it just run into the stopped car? The first choice would limit the damage to said car and driver but potentially hurt or kill pedestrians? If it chooses to just run into the stopped car, the self driving car would be totaled and the driver possibly hurt/killed along with those in the stopped car. There are countless other scenarios that deal with ethical questions like this. You may say, well I bought the car so it should save me, but I would argue that it is not that simple. Laws need to be passed when you are dealing with a death machine on wheels. Algorithms will need to be developed in connection with these said laws.
