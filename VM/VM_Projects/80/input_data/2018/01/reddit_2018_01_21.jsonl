IN MY OPINION I think forcing the consumer's hand was a blunder on their part hence the negative press. With that said people are entitled to their own opinions. \n\nAs for CD/DVD-RW drives, you're really comparing apples to oranges. The technological shift to digital distribution brought upon by higher internet speeds, a more ecological and cost-effective distribution system, and larger files has pushed out physical mediums like CDs, DVDs, Bluray, etc. and some companies deemed them unnecessary. The last I looked at audio equipment, most manufacturers were still building audio equipment with cables. That's my opinion, I think they reduced the quality of their experience by forcing their users hand by making them buy an adapter or shift to wireless gear. I don't buy Apple products so it didn't affect me, just stating my opinion on their \"innovative\" decision.

Its not like they gave up the headphone jack and gained nothing from it. They are using that saved space. The new iphones that use the entire body of the phone could not work well at all with that headphone jack there, it likely would not have been possible. So i'm sure they considered the bad press, the push back, and the things they would be able to do going forward with the decision. \n\nPersonally, I have used iphone for about 4 years and I never use the headphone jack, so its no loss to me. I still have the iphone that has it, but I just never use it. I connect to bluetooth in my car and then most everything else I just use the speakers on it. \n\nBu I think its a little early to label this a blunder. Bad press does not mean somethings a blunder, there was a lot of bad press and negative people when apple did the iPad. What will define this as a blunder is if the phone doesn't sell well and having no headphone jack is reverted and other phones don't adopt the same thing.

For those that never use it then it makes sense that they wouldn't be affected by the removal. To be perfectly honest I haven't really examined the iPhone 7 or beyond as I've yet to have to fix any thus I'll take your word that the removal of the jack was imperative for their design build :). \n\nWe'll see if it becomes a mainstream movement across all manufacturers though. I'm rocking an almost 5 year old device because of the build quality and form factor plus I flash custom ROMs so thus far I'm not looking to upgrade until it bites the bullet. It'll be interesting to see what comes down the line and whether Apple's calculated risk paves the way for that movement.
