{"title": "HUGE TCEHY DD!", "selftext": "Hello everyone, and welcome to the greatest DD of 2018. To begin with, what makes me qualified to make this kind of financial recommendation? Well, why don’t we go over some of my qualifications…\n\n1. I have been a legal adult for almost a full year\n2. I received a passing score on the AP Art History Exam\n3. I entered AMD a year and a half ago and I am still holding it (shoutout to my boys at r/AMDstock)\n4. Less than 75% of my portfolio was given to me by my dad\n5. I scored high enough on an online autism test to potentially be a savant\n6. I have Investopedia bookmarked in Google Chrome\n7. I mock cryptocurrency and tell people who have tripled their money in 18 minutes that they’re in a bubble.\n8. And finally, I’m actually working on a script for a stock trading anime, so I’ve done plenty of research on unicorn stocks that will allow my main character (Kiritsigu) to become rich overnight and start snorting coke off the handrails of his yacht.\n\nI’ll admit, I’m pretty proud of everything I’ve listed here, and I think it makes me perfectly qualified for your average joe trying to pick up a hot tip at the water cooler. But we both know that if you’re on this subreddit, you’re no average joe, and you definitely do not work anywhere nice enough to have a water cooler. So of course, this impressive list isn’t nearly enough for you all. Which is why it is time that I introduce the sub-wide baghold of the future, and why I, in particular, am qualified to recommend it: Tencent. \n\nThose of you who are not familiar with the juggernaut of a company might be asking, “what do they do?” \nThey make money. More specifically, they own a bunch of smaller tech companies that make money, and then they take that money. What companies in particular? Go fucking google it, jesus, I can’t do everything for you. But I can tell you one company that they own. Riot Games. As in the Riot Games that develops the most widespread PC game in the world: League of Legends. Now I know what you’re thinking: this kid is just some gold LoL fuckboy who thinks he is a genius for investing in his favorite video game. First off, I’m legally an adult and if you ever call me a kid again I’ll have my dad sue you for slander, secondly, I’m Plat, and finally, I don’t think I’m a genius for investing in my favorite video game, I think I’m a genius for discovering the ultimate investment opportunity.\n\nBut wait, there’s more!\n\nWhere is Tencent located? If you possessed the motor function and or motivation necessary to google it by now, you would know that it is a CHINESE company! This is huge, because when it comes to China, IM YOUR FUCKING MAN.\n\nIt all began when I was a dumb child at the young age of 17, and I decided that I loved anime so much that when I would take Chinese classes so I could understand what my waifu, Rin, was saying in her native language. I did eventually discover that Chinese and Japanese are “totally different languages”, but I already knew how to say hello in Mandarin so I kept going. I’ve worked harder at that class than anything in my life (except this DD of course) and as a result I UNDERSTAND CHINESE. That’s not to say I’m fluent or even know more than about 50 words, but I know enough to be able to give you guys the EXCLUSIVE INSIDER KNOWLEDGE you will need to succeed in the Chinese market. As proof of my Chinese knowledge, allow me to write you all a poem.\n\n我很智残\n你们很也智残\n所以我们挣钱\n\nNow for the boring part. In the 12 minutes I spent on Yahoo Finance I saw that this incredible corporation has DOUBLED their revenue in just a year! Four quarters in a row they have roundhouse kicked their earnings, and there seems to be no stopping them. I even went so far as to read their last earnings report, and this is where my Chinese understanding really kicks in. Their guidance is super positive, referencing substantial growth in virtually all their sectors. But what’s the one thing you uncultured autists would never think to do? Evaluate the tones. For those of you who don’t know, Chinese is a tonal language, and so the pitch of your voice has to change depending on the word you are saying. I translated the entire earnings report back into Chinese (thank you google translate) and analyzed the tones of every word in it. There is an absolute abundance of second tone words...\n“Okay, who gives a shit?” I can see you mumbling as you chew an over cooked chicken tender.\n\nThe second tone rises.\n\nIt rises high, high up into the sky, like a rocket to the moon. And that is exactly where this stock is going. I believe this so fully that I even sold my Platinum rank League of Legends account, complete with every teemo skin, on eBay for more cash to put in. So join me, and May we together eat delicious tendies dipped in all the Szechuan sauce we can stomach.\n\nEdit: formatting\n\nTLDR: I’m a weaboo who accidentally learned Chinese and is using his knowledge of the tonal system to speculate on a Hong Kong technology holdings company that he know of only because they own his favorite video game.
