I’ll try to answer any questions in the comments.\n\nEdit - I misspoke when I said I inherited it. I received 500 shares when I was born and it has now grown to what it is worth today.\nalso I have about $45000 invested in other companies and index fund.\nmy main issue is selling right now when it is so low compared to what it was a year ago while the market has generally down very well. seems like selling low buying high if I sell and reinvest currently. it is not in a tax advantage account currently.", "id": "88u20s", "created_utc": 1522617123.0, "score": 134, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 78, "comments": [{"body": "As someone who also owns PPL:\n\nYield is in the low 5% paid monthly with $0.18 per share. 1800x0.18 gives you 324 bucks a month in dividend. \n\nYeah, the company isn’t doing so well currently in share price but I wouldn’t worry to much about it for right this moment. \n\nDo a lot of due diligence in researching other companies if you decide to buy out and reinvest.

On average, we find that an LSI approach has outperformed a DCA approach approximately two-thirds of the time, even when results are adjusted for the higher volatility of a stock/bond portfolio versus cash investments.\n\n> We conclude that if an investor expects such trends to continue, is satisfied with his or her target asset allocation, and is comfortable with the risk/return characteristics of each strategy, the prudent action is investing the lump sum immediately to gain exposure to the markets as soon as possible.

Of course, any emotionally based concerns should be weighed carefully against both (1) the lower expected long-run returns of cash compared with stocks and bonds, and **(2) the fact that delaying investment is itself a form of market-timing**, something few investors succeed at. \n\n[Source](https://personal.vanguard.com/pdf/s315.pdf)", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "No, look up lump sum vs dollar cost average.
