{"title": "Google has crashed the market with its piss poor earnings; so how do you profit from here?", "selftext": "As predicted^[1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/8edrf8/buy_some_puts_sell_before_close/dxucic7/?context=0)[2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/8dp3hl/can_anyone_provide_a_bull_case_for_google_heading/) , Google fumbled its earnings and has brought the broader tech industry down along with it. Good news is this is the best opportunity for profit you will get in a while.\n\n---\n\nFirst, it is important to understand why Google crashed. Google views itself as an all powerful panopticon that should compete in every industry that remotely interacts with the internet. In recent years, this position has been strongly challenged by Amazon. Thus, in recent quarters, Google has been scrambling to invest in ways that would allow it to compete with Amazon.\n\nThis effort, at least in the eyes of investors, has failed spectacularly. The problem? Google is (was) a very profitable company. Amazon historically makes absolutely no profit. Whenever Google opens up a new front to compete against Amazon, it loses margin. Whenever Amazon does anything to compete with Google, it gains margin because its core business is 0 profit or negative. Google's investors have gotten used to making fat profits every quarter, and its current trajectory of diminishing margins has led investors to punish the stock tremendously.\n\nSo now that Google has crashed its own stock and brought the broader tech companies along with it, how do you profit? Easy, invest in FANGesque companies that DO NOT compete with Amazon and was brought down without reason by Google.\n\nBoth Twitter and Facebook are companies that investors have tied to Google, but neither of these companies have made any moves in this quarter or in any recent quarter to compete directly with Amazon; and Amazon is not competing with them either. Earnings expectations for these companies (both report on wednesday) have now been lowered when they should not have been. Expect margins to remain intact and a rally when they report (Netflix style).\n\nAnd of course, invest in Amazon itself. Reinvest all of your gains from Twitter and Facebook calls into Amazon calls on Thursday.\n\n---\n\nProof of TWTR and FB buys on the dip: https://imgur.com/a/RMIuSsJ\n\n---\n\n- Wednesday premarket: TWTR reports massive beat, stock way up\n- Wednesday conference call: CEO comes on and says careful for rest of year. stock back to prev close\n- Market open: twtr up, couldve sold here for a profit on my calls but I didnt, stock craters intraday\n- Market close: twtr down 2%, fb unchanged. Need FB to report a beat to carry this bet\n- Aftermarket: nice, fb reported a beat, up nicely; bringing twitter up along with it. Should be able to sell calls tomorrow for a profit and reinvest in amazon. \n\n**Thursday**\n\n- Midday: Facebook up 9%, exited calls with over 100% profit\n- Midday: Twtr up 5%, exited calls barely above break even because of down day yesterday.\n- Reinvesting in AMZN calls ", "id": "8eldd7", "created_utc": 1524584475.0, "score": 214, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 83, "comments": [{"body": "You’re going to get fucked lol", "score": 153, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 52, "replies": [{"body": "that is non-news. wow you can find SSNs if you look for it on facebook.
