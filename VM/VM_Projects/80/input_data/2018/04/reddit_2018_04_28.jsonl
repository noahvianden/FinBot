Your GDP is 20T, and the yearly tax revenue is only 3.3T total. And that's just government debt, not including personal debt, auto loans, student loans, etc. You never recovered from the 2008 GFC, the federal reserve created money out of nothing, and used it to buy up toxic mortgages to the tune of 4.5T. The only reason you don't have runaway inflation yet is because the world must trade oil in USD, otherwise they end up like Iraq, Libya, and Syria. But now that Russia has started defending countries you invade, and Trump isn't willing to go to war over it, you can't do that anymore. Countries will start dumping your over priced, over printed money, and the US economy will crash.\n\nWhy the fuck are you talking about debt to credit ratio?

I will concede that I'm not 100% sure what the 200T of non-tangilble assets entails.

Unless they do something like taxing or seizing assets directly (bad idea), there is no way for the US government to pay what it owes or promises.\n\nAt least, that's how I see it.\n\nEDIT: It's like taking a 1mil mortgage, on a 10mil property, on a 50k salary.
