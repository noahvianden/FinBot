If we include those that's 90.18% of revenue from retail related activities.\n\nYeah but retail-related doesn't mean it has the characteristics of a retail business. FB serves ads to help companies sell stuff, it doesn't make FB's business anything like retail. Obviously if you think Amazon's retail operation will fail, then its advertising operation is not going to save it-- I just can't see why anyone would think that's likely.\n\n>Amazon's third party market place services only makes up 17.92% of revenue.\n\nYeah but \"only 18%\" is a big number when you're talking about AMZN, and the margins matter. third party is composed of FBA and listings. FBA is a very low margin business. Listings is an extremely high margin business. A significant chunk of that 18% is listings. FBA+listings is not retailing; it's renting out shelf space for businesses which is why I say it doesn't have the characteristics of a retail business. AMZN takes no risk with inventory, with product management, etc. \n\nIf you're valuing AMZN based on free cash flow, then you're going to be really pleased with the fact that when Amazon's revenues grow their accounts payable grows as well which makes free cash flow grow as well. Honestly I would say that was extremely important when Amazon had no capital and needed to grow, but if you think Amazon approaches saturation in a couple years, which you would have to think in order to be bearish, then I don't see why you would be excited about that since that cash comes to an end when growth does.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I don‚Äôt think Amazon is a bad company and it does have solid financials, but the amount of growth potential that others see, in my opinion, is unrealistic and near irrational exuberance.
