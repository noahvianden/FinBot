In 2016, Apple informed Supermicro that it was severing their relationship entirely—a decision a spokesman for Apple ascribed in response to Businessweek’s questions to an unrelated and relatively minor security incident.\n\n>That August, Supermicro’s CEO, Liang, revealed that the company had lost two major customers.
