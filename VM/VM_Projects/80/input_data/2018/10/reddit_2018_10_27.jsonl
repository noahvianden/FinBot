The federal funds rate is the **open market** rate for financial institutions to borrow from one another (as your link says, uncollateralized loans between financial institutions) and is volatile if things go south.   Just because it is stable doesn't mean the Fed isn't changing things behind the scenes to keep it stable.\n\nThe Fed sets a target for this rate and uses a porous price ceiling (the discount rate) and floor (reserve interest rates) to encourage banks to lend at their target, but in a financial crisis those funds will not actually be available to borrow. \n\nBanks can turn to the Fed as the borrower of last resort, but the Fed requires collateral and approval from the Treasury to do so. \n\nThe Fed can lower the interest it offers banks to hold reserves to increase the velocity of money.  This is the part that can actually go negative in places like Japan or Europe, the central bank fines banks that hold excess reserves to increase the money supply.  The Fed can also increase the discount rate to encourage banks to be more conservative with their lending (usually lowering the velocity of money) if money is too loose as it is now. Finally, the Fed could change reserve requirements to make money loser or tighter. \n\nThe Fed has other tools to increase the money supply.  They can buy financial assets to increase the money supply (quantitative easing).  This is like printing money except there's a payback time attached to the bonds they buy up and they could sell the asset later.  They could also literally print money, though that would be a disaster for the dollar. \n\nThe other thing to note is Congress could produce a stimulus package.
