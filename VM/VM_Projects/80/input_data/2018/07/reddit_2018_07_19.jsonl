So when you buy them you are literally gambling on the intrinsic value, which is the difference between the options strike and the stock price.  What little extrinsic value exists in FDs vanishes after the earnings report, so technically you start out in the hole, because you had to pay for the chance to play. On top of that, there's no time for the price to fix itself if you guess wrong, or even if you guess right but the market is  slow, or whatever, so it's a great way to lose money.", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you for giving a sincere response, seriously ", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "No problem man, we're all just out here trying to make some tendies.
