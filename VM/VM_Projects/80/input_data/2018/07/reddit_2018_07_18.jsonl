Bush administration Treasury secretary.\n\nMr. Bernanke is currently [a scholar at the Brookings Institution](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ben-bernanke-loosens-up-during-his-post-crisis-years-1524229203?mod=article_inline) in Washington. He led the central bank from 2006 to 2014 and was succeeded by Janet Yellen, who was replaced by Jerome Powell as Fed chairman this year.\n\nThe three men met with reporters in New York to take a look back at the financial crisis at a meeting at the Council on Foreign Relations. Those troubles began [over a decade ago](http://graphics.wsj.com/how-the-world-has-changed-since-2008-financial-crisis/?mod=article_inline) and all three were intimately involved in leading the response to those events.\n\nThe current narrowing, [called a flattening,](https://www.wsj.com/articles/behind-the-flattening-yield-curve-fed-rate-increases-and-tariff-fights-1530801000?mod=article_inline) is in large part driven by Fed rate rises and the expectation that more are coming. Meanwhile, still-low inflation and the expectation it will stay that way is one of the factors helping limit the rise in long-dated bonds.\n\nMr. Bernanke acknowledged that an inversion is ‚Äúa good forecaster of economic downturns,‚Äù but said the Fed must look at a broad array of factors to think about the future of the economy.\n\n‚ÄúThere‚Äôs an argument‚Äù that maybe inversions aren‚Äôt the signal they once were because long-term interest rates ‚Äúare unusually low,‚Äù as is the market-based compensation for risk, Mr. Bernanke said. He added that bond buying by other central banks and regulatory changes are also altering bond-market levels. The yield curve ‚Äúis one indicator, but you wouldn‚Äôt want to religiously consider that being the only indicator,‚Äù Mr. Bernanke said.\n\nThe former Fed chair has cast a cautious eye toward the yield curve before, and it turned out to be the wrong call. In 2006, he brushed off a yield curve teetering around inversion and said he wouldn‚Äôt interpret it as ‚Äúindicating a significant economic slowdown to come.‚Äù He also said that ‚Äúthe bottom line for policy appears ambiguous.‚Äù The economy was in recession by 2007.\n\nMr. Bernanke‚Äôs comments were made a day before current Fed Chairman Jerome Powell began two days of testimony on the economy and monetary policy before congress. Mr. Powell [told legislators Tuesday he expects to press forward with gradual rate rises](https://www.wsj.com/articles/powell-says-fed-should-keep-gradually-raising-interest-rates-1531836002?mod=article_inline). He cited the ‚Äústrong performance‚Äù of the economy as the reason for the increases, although he did acknowledge there are risks to the outlook, notably on the trade front.\n\nMr. Powell acknowledged the Fed‚Äôs interest in the yield curve but didn‚Äôt offer his assessment about its message for the outlook.\n\nSome Fed officials, like the leaders of the Atlanta and Philadelphia Fed banks, have signaled [a willingness to back off on rate increases if they think monetary policy is about to cause an inversion](https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-officials-debate-signal-from-flattening-yield-curve-is-this-time-different-1531051200?mod=article_inline).
