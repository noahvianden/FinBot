A call is an agreement that the writer of the contract will sell you the shares at the listed price by the date listed on the contract, in this case, $230 on January 18 of next year. If the share price reaches that target price before the date, then the contract becomes \"ITM\" or in the money, and holds its value a bit better than when it as \"OTM\" or out of the money. As the stock price goes up, so does the value of the contract, with a couple caveats: the value of a contract will always decrease as it approaches the target date, mainly due to \"IV\" or implied volatility. The reason is that, as time runs out, the stock has a shorter time to reach that target price, or still go up if it's ITM. This is called IV Crush. For this reason, you always want the stock to rise faster than the contract value can decay.\n\nAs for put options, they work similarly, however, instead of someone agreeing to sell you those 100 shares, they offer to buy them from you at the target price.
