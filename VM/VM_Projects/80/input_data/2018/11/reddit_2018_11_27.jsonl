They learn that they actually own part of a company that they're familiar with, and that they receive a little (very little) money for owning that share.\n\nAnd the stock certificate's artwork is great too.

An actual company has no idea who you are, their stock is registered to DTC:\n\n> Most large U.S. broker-dealers and banks are full DTC participants, meaning that they deposit and hold securities at DTC. DTC appears in an issuer’s stock records as the sole registered owner of securities deposited at DTC. DTC holds the deposited securities in “fungible bulk”, meaning that there are no specifically identifiable shares directly owned by DTC participants. Rather, each participant owns a pro rata interest in the aggregate number of shares of a particular issuer held at DTC. Correspondingly, each customer of a DTC participant, such as an individual investor, owns a pro rata interest in the shares in which the DTC participant has an interest.\n\nThis seems a little ridiculous, but it makes things like dividends a lot easier because they can pay central actors and not send tiny checks all over the place which would often cost more than the dividends themselves.
