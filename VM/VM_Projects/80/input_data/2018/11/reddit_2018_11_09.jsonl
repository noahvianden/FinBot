Evidence to support this includes the very high put prices - but the put prices could also be explained by the extremely high volatility, and difficulty of shorting shares.  \n  \nSecond, some big money knows something we don't, or at least *sees* something in their analysis we don't. This is possible, but i don't think it could fully explain things - their valuation relative to anyone else in the industry is insane.  \n  \nThird, big money is responsible, but they're just as retarded as anyone else on this, or are just following other dipshits who just want any possible exposure to anything in this industry.  \n  \nFourth, its been part of someones pump and dump, or some other scheme. I think this is less likely because they'd probably have dumped long ago by now - TLRY was briefly trading above $250 at one point.  \n  \nOf course, it could be some combination of the 4.
