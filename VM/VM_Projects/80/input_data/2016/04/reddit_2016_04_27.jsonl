{"title": "The biggest misunderstanding about technical analysis is thinking it gives you direction.", "selftext": "I saw that post about TA yesterday, and seeing the number of upvotes I understand why so many people are turned off by it.\n\nIt's hard to think of a car as useful if you believe that it's a yacht.\n\nTechnical analysis gives you targets, not direction. It's no mystery that the market closes on moving averages or opens on them.\n\nSupport and resistance aren't walls that a rubber ball bounces off of. They're webs that slow down momentum. When the market hits a support, it'll often stop there for the day, and give market participants time for a pause to think. They're obstacles that tell people, OK it's time to take a step back, and re-evaluate, kind of like when an army advances, it'll advance quickly until a strategic point (support/resistance), then send out scouts (overshooting then coming back) to see if it's safe to advance any further. If it is, then they advance quickly to the next strategic point, otherwise they retreat.\n\nStrategic points tell you nothing about what lies ahead. A top of a hill is a good place to rest and set up camp, it doesn't mean that every hill you encounter means \"TURN BACK NOW, YOU'RE GOING TO GET MASSACRED AHEAD\".\n\nIn fact, stock trading is very similar to war. Bulls vs. bears. Every strategic point is basically the trenches/battleground between the two armies. You'll have mercenaries who change camps, and you'll also have allies who'll come help (big hedge funds entering a position) send in huge reinforcements. News are similar to getting ammunition or a natural disaster. AAPL bulls losing to the bears yesterday was because the bears suddenly got a huge drop-off of weapons and ammunition. When companies beat earnings, it's like the bulls just got an ammunition drop-off, but then a horrible guidance is telling them that the bears have lots of tanks further ahead, and that they should retreat, because machine guns can't beat an M1 Abrams.", "id": "4gpt9b", "created_utc": 1461780999.0, "score": 46, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 83, "comments": [{"body": "I like this fanfiction.

You think yes, and she does too, then the relationship grows. However, often, you're still unsure, so you go on several dates (range-bound trading). You also know that the relationship has to grow, otherwise it fails (rising trendline). Support and resistance are like those days and nights spent deciding whether or not you want to continue or dump.\n\nSometimes, you reach couple status, and then things stagnate. There's no more growth, so it just oscillates with each fight, up and down, up and down (triangle), and you reach a point where you have to decide to move to the next level (break-out) or break up (break-down).\n\nRumours can destroy your relationship, while it can also boost it. Everyone saying she cheated on you will make you doubt, and your relationship will falter. However, if the false allegations are proven outright wrong, your relationship will grow to the next level (V shape recovery). Often though, the thought still lingers, because rumours are never proven outright wrong, and a lot of couples don't survive rumours (hint: if you want to break up a weak couple/new relationship, start rumours).\n\nIn the case of AAPL, it's like a really successful relationship that went through huge downs (1990s) and huge ups (2000s), so it's very solid. There were promotions every year for the past decade, and the couple could really see their future improving, bigger house, better cars, a yacht, a private jet, better sex, but then suddenly, no promotion. The husband is disappointed he couldn't get the extra money needed to upgrade his dick, and you definitely see the mood change in the relationship. It's still strong though, and they say they'll be in this together (reversal up). But if the stagnation continues, then all the excitement is gone, and that's when husbands and wives cheat. Often when such a situation happens, the relationship never recovers (BBRY). However, 1 promotion missed isn't the end of the relationship, the wife wanted a 14\", but she won't be disappointed with a 10\". The wife (products) are still sexy although not as fresh and young, so the husband also has interests in keeping the relationship afloat, though not as much as when she was a hot college cheerleader.\n\nNow, there are also one-night-stands. You know they aren't good long term relationship material, so you move fast, pump the dick and dump the chick. They look sexy, but you mostly go for them because they'll give you sex fast, and who doesn't like quick sex?
