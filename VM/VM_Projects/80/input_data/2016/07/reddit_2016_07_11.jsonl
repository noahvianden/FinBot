Right now it looks like Tesla is sacrificing money for market share and brand recognition, which is normally a good strategy. However, their stock is way too high. Why would I buy one share Tesla when, for about the same money, I could buy two shares of Apple?

Apple's company has not been going anywhere cept down since steve jobs died. The board members of apple do not believe in innovation. The hired an anti-innovation ceo and kept him in office too. They rather make money making jewelry then making tech. This is something that tim cook has said in the past.\n\nEvery reiteration of iphones fall behind samsung's androids. So many additions they could just copy from the android to make it \"better\". They change up the cables for no other reason other than people will be forced to purchase new adapters that fit their new iphones. They also make iphones less repairable too. They do similar things with macbooks. It also honestly feels like they purposefully make iphones easy to break.\n\nI use iphones and I'm typing on a macbook.. I have held apple stock for several years and I'm honestly sick of all they don't do.
