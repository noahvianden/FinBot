So, let me explain this to you in simple terms. There's something called an API, which is an abstraction software layer over the machine code. In other words, it converts binary to code that the program software (games, forex) can understand and vice versa.\n\nAMD wrote a low level (minimal abstraction) API called Mantle to take advantage of their architecture, particularly the out of order execution capabilities that weren't used in Dx11. Mantle was used in the Bitfrost engine for Battlefield 3, which is a huge AAA franchise.\n\nThen came along Vulkan and Dx12, both of which are low level APIs like Mantle. In fact, Vulkan is an updated version of Mantle and is used in Doom (another huge AAA franchise). Dx12 in Microsoft's proprietary fork of Mantle; this should surprise nobody given Microsoft's cooperative history with AMD.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that AMD hardware powers both Microsoft's and Sony's consoles. In effect, AMD owns the gaming market.\n\nAs for this idiot's claim that Nvidia has some hardware secret sauce. Um... No. Nvidia has spent the last 15 years updating an architecture they didn't even invent and even then those hardware improvements have only reflected gains in the present mainstream. This is a problem, because AMD owns the IP needed to take full advantage of the new APIs, which they effectively wrote. To understand in real terms how screwed Nvidia is long term, consider the fact that their newest \"mainstream\" GPU, the GTX 1060, is getting absolutely crushed by the RX 480 in games where Dx12 or Mantle are used despite a raw clock advantage of 600Mhz.\n\nNow, that's the background. In my opinion, Nvidia's stock price is artificially high because of their present market share advantage, which is backed by the still massive numbers of 680Ti and 780Ti cards that are still in use. Once those die and the former owners buy in on new hardware, the market share is probably going to even out. Nvidia's stock price will crash as a result.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Understood a dozen words.
