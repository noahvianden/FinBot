{"title": "Market's crashing in less than 6 months. Get out. DD inside.", "selftext": "Legit the only reason I'm posting this is because when it happens I get to make fun of anyone who disagreed with me. Maybe I shoulda posted in r/investing, but fuck those guys. \n\nSo like I said, I'd get out of the market. Like now. I'll explain why. And don't worry, I'll even tell you when to get back in. \n\nI've posted about this before, but it was in comments and they never gained a lot of traction. This being WSB, I'm sure most of you haven't read [this](http://www.philosophicaleconomics.com/2016/02/uetrend/) post on the philosophical economics blog. You don't have to, because I'm gonna explain it right now. \n\n(Here's my independent [excel](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cfh84iYIBGGT_GSLVLrdYdLLfjV21o59cOHvnF5eb3s/edit?usp=sharing) file. Its messy af but deal with it)\n\nBasically, the guy found that when the 12 month moving average of the civilian unemployment rate crosses the real civilian unemployment rate, there's a good chance of recession. Notably, this indicator has a LOT OF FALSE POSITIVES. Lots of false calls for recession. \n\nThat makes it a shitty indicator, right? Wrong. Because every time there HAS been a recession, it's called it. We just have to figure out how to rule out the false positives. \n\nSO what this guy on philosophical economics did was add some S&P 500 moving average indicator and combine it with the unemployment rate indicator. And, no shit, it beat the market. \n\nBut I fucking tested it in excel. Which wasn't easy. And yeah you woulda beaten the market over the long run. BUT, BUT BUT **BUT**, the returns were almost **ALL** from the last 2 *recessions/market crashes*. \n\nThis is key. Recession DOES NOT EQUAL market crash. Only the last 2 recessions have also had a market crash in near perfect tandem. \n\nOh. I forgot to mention. The indicator crossed last month. And for what it's worth, the bullshit S&P MA indicator the blogger made has already crossed too. \n\nSo like I said, since it's crossed, we just have to figure out if it's a false positive or not. Well, here, let me ask you, stop for a second.\n\nWhat do you fucking think. \n\nDo you think the economy is gonna be fine? Like. Don't even use indicators or anything. Do things look good right now? No. Everything's fucked. \n\nSo even if you're a LITTLE nervous right now, and almost all the smart money is getting at least a little nervous, this should be the symbol flashing at you to get the fuck out.\n\nOh yeah, and the 10 month S&P 500 moving average actually does something. It tells you roughly when the market bottom is. Every time. You're welcome. \n\nTo conclude. All in on JNUG.\n\n[Edit]: there appears to be some confusion here. This was a joke\n\nMaybe I should start writing for ZeroHedge. \n\nEDIT: If I had to reccomend a course of action I would wait to sell and short until there is a legitimate downturn. You'll still sit out most of the losses and you would have ridden the rest of the way up pre crash", "id": "5866re", "created_utc": 1476822904.0, "score": 73, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 83, "comments": [{"body": "> Do you think the economy is gonna be fine? \n\nYep.
