I typically look for big lows for companies that have positive future outlooks, and invest my money and just let it sit. I don't like selling high/buying low often, because really, in the end, there are people out there with loads more experience doing the exact same thing, and in my opinion, it's simply a waste of time for people like me.\n\nHowever, I do like researching companies, seeing if they have a bright future, and seeing if people have overreacted to a purely short term situation. Plenty of people benefit from day trading, which is purely short term, so my aim is to kind of use that to my advantage. What one person finds beneficial in short term, I use to my benefit long term. \n\nBut again, what do I know. Keep doing what feels right, and always have a process.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for the feedback.  I'll follow up with my results after a few more months.
