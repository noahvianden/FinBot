Loose underwriting standards and companies going public before having a solidified business plan led to these valuations. The market reaching historic valuations doesn't signal a crash alone. What is the market pricing anomaly that drove the DJIA, S&P 500, and Nasdaq to new record highs?\n\n>\"Second, if Janet Yellen announces an interest rate hike, investors who are used to the low rate are going to become uneasy and pull their money, at least in the short term, creating a ripple effect.\"\n\nIt is important to consider that the Fed is likely committed to a lower for long policy. Traders believe the chances of a rate hike this year are around 47% ([Source](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-08-19/treasury-rally-repels-fed-hawks-as-rate-odds-fall-back-below-50)). Additionally, the Fed purposefully hints at interest rate hikes (i.e. the [FOMC Dot Plot](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-06-15/the-fed-s-new-dot-plot-chart) and press releases) to prepare markets for this scenario. \n\n>\"Third, big names like Robert Kiyosaki, Donald Trump, and Warren Buffett have warned that a possible collapse could be coming.\"\n\nWhile it is advantageous to listen to accomplished investors, I wouldn't predict a stock market crash solely because Donald Trump said so.

In addition, many of the withdrawn retirement assets will be reinvested in the market using a similar investment vehicle. \n\n>\"Fifth, the liquidity crisis that the mortgage market may be about to face will further hurt the market.\"\n\nAs I haven't heard much about a liquidity crisis, I need to read about this.

", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "That's not an easy question to answer. \n\nIn largely all historical stock market crashes asset bubbles have been present. The Great Depression was preceded by a real estate bubble and a stock market bubble. The dotcom bubble obviously lead to a significant collapse in equity valuations, and  a real estate bubble caused the Great Recession. With the Fed and many global central banks employing low and zero-interest rate policy, there is a legitimate concern that we have artificially inflated valuations through loose monetary policy. \n\nIf the Fed pursues aggressive increases in interest rates (i.e. 2017 - 2.5% and 2018 - 3.5%), equities and global markets in general will likely react very negatively. The degree of the reaction to an increase in interest rates will depend on the magnitude and speed at which interest rates are raised and a number of peripheral factors. It would be particularly bad if the Fed raised rates only to decrease them when concerns about slow economic growth and recession legitimize. \n\nIf Trump is elected on November 8th and proceeds to wage his trade war against China and Mexico, all products imported from those countries will become significantly more expensive. This punishes the consumer. Consumer spending accounts for 71% of GDP, and recently consumer spending has been one of the healthiest parts of the US economy. A Trump presidency likely would create a scenario similar to the Brexit in US markets, with valuations stabilizing in the near-term, but overall negative consequences for business in the long-term. \n\nAny number of black swan events could result in a stock market crash, such as another instance of a flash crash.

Depending on how this is done could severely threaten market stability.  \n\nThe other potential flash point is European banks.  European banks are not looking pretty and if the trend continues, we could see serious system threat from European banks.  \n\nLastly, I believe a major crisis in the confidence in central banks is inevitable.  People are eventually going to realize the corner the Federal Reserve is backed into and everyone is going to be heading for the same exit at the same time.
