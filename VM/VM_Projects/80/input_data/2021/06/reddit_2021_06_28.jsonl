{"title": "Ford 2023 Long Calls", "selftext": "I know it's not a lot, but I'm putting in around $213 for three 2023 Ford Calls with a strike price of $30. Ford is a good brand. Ford is quintessentially American and a keystone of innovation. Here is why I like ford. Tesla is expensive. German electric (VW, Audi, Mercedes, Porsche) is pretty pricey, not to mention that VW uses a different charging adapter than Tesla, which creates even more confusion for the average consumer (\"Why can't I charge at this Walmart?\"). Ford has been undervalued ever since they decided not to take the 2008 bail-out money. That's okay since that ship has sailed and they are out from this for the most part.\n\nAmericans for the most part don't like change. Electric cars bring change. Between having to charge at home or at work, finding a new mechanic, or even learning all the new ins and outs of an electric car, this change and influx of new information is scary for the average American consumer. No matter the brand of car, new electric cars will bring this plight. Keeping with what they know (which is American-made-American brands), these consumers would opt for Ford in a heartbeat (if ford is all they have ever owned). There is brand loyalty in the car sector. Once someone finds something they like, they tend to stick with that car or brand for as long as they can, or until they feel they need a switch. \n\n1. Ford has brand loyalty from its current base, which can make the shift to electric more comfortable.\n2. Old people aren't buying electric cars (new cars, even) en masse. The CPI-E shows a rise in their cost of living. This will affect everyone, but for someone with higher living and healthcare costs (old people), buying a car might not be a top priority (plus if you're not able to drive in a few, the opportunity of the car purchase might be too great compared to saving money for healthcare or fun things).  \n3. Electric competition is not great. Cadillac is barely in the door, Toyota Electric is viewed as a luxury level, not an alternative choice for the avg consumer, Honda has a few electric cars (but they're seriously no fun--cmon, cars should be fun. Ford has fun, Ford has innovation. Ford has price, Ford has variety. \n4. Compared to other car companies, ford stock is dumb cheap. \n5. Ford's lineup is their greatest strength. A car for everyone. Electric or not. In every price range. In every industry. Electric cars being fully mainstream should be about 10 years out. We're lagging in chargers, acceptance, and price. Ford hybrid vehicles fill this void, all while not separating electric or nonelectric into higher classes of luxury features (Toyota). Electric here is not a status symbol, it is a mainstream dream, and Ford wants it to become reality.\n\nCyberpunk isn't our reality. Tunnels going between cities isn't coming anytime soon. The cybertruck is a luxury vehicle with a boastful design that screams (look at me, I've got money, and even if this car can tug a boat, I don't care, I'm definitely a suburbanite with a brand new toy.) Tesla's are cool. Tesla's are fun. But they catch eyes, and they make electric cars a status symbol, rather than an environmental obligation. Ford combats that, directly, fairly, and even if some of their prices (Mach-E with a starting price fo 41k-ish) is a bit high, the Mach-E is just a fun version of a mustang and is meant to catch eyes, unlike the Lightning or the Fusion.\n\nFord's lineup: [https://www.ford.com/](https://www.ford.com/)\n\nInflation is looming: Sure, probably, it might already be here. I don't care. Economies go in cycles, boo hoo. People will always need cars. Might not be able to purchase a car, but who cars, you can lease. Ford has their own leasing LLC under their ticker, and more importantly, FORD HAS AFFORDABLE VEHICLES THAT SUIT A WIDE RANGE OF NEEDS THAT DONT COMPROMISE TOO MUCH QUALITY FOR THEIR PRICE OR CHANGE IN SIZE. \n\nFord is a value investment.
