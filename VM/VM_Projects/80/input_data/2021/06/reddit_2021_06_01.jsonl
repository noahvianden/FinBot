{"title": "Any advice for minimizing losses as this point on a short... and hear me out for those who would rather ridicule for having done so! AMC", "selftext": "Overall I know the glaring recommendation is stop messing with what I'm not familiar with, but would really like to get back $10k of losses before exiting. If you have the time and patience to listen to my buffoonery...\n\nI was lucky owning AMC before the initial short squeeze. Gained $16k and sold! I was only looking to buy and hold at that time but once something like that happens as a newbie it kind of sticks on your radar. I attributed this gain to luck not just for myself but for most involved really combined with some greed being exploited. So after that and reading it was very unlikely to happen again as hedge funds would be more prepared... well that made a lot of sense to me. So when there were then 2 quicks runs from around $9-12 range then back down and I made about $650 each time in a just a couple days (shorting after $11.5 and covering around $9.50).\n\nThis third instance I was just going to to the same, was just looking for a little profit.. but it clearly hasn't worked out the same. And kept buying a little more as it went up. Then all of a sudden the price went from $18 a share to over $30 and I got nervous thinking of these claims of it going up over $100/share... so I cover 800 of the 1700 shares I was short at $34 last week (on the spike up to $36) ...only to see it crash quick. Where then I was pissed I let fear set in as I'm never like that. I compared the price trends/graph on other squeezes and it looked to match other reversals... so that then made me think I was going to be missing out on all the continued price drops that were to come and I was an idiot of paying $34 to cover and I should get those shorts back to at least recoup some of what I would have otherwise if I didn't cover then.... so re-shorted the 800 around $26..... only to see it go back over $32 shortly after, maximizing my current losses in a few steps for nothing.\n\nSo now I've lost all my previous gains I made from owning on the first squeeze and the couple shorts a I did after... plus another $10k+. Maybe be even closer to $15k right now. My idea was if I could just skip out on all this volatility and possibility of getting squeezed to oblivion and purchase 1000 shares to hedge if it keeps climbing... I can hold and let things play out and then when we're in a reversal downtrend then close out.\n\nMy reason for not simply closing it is because I'd lose my short positions and they're not always available... and I do believe it's going to go down (although I know Reddit is probably not the best place to voice such thoughts without vitriol coming my way). The two previous other instances I shorted I'd say only 10% of my orders went though and I would have to sit there repeatedly trying to get an order to short to go through, rejected for market unavailability. If I close my shorts I could very well be not getting them back if everyone else sees the stock as being in a reversal and want to short as well at that time... I would lose my ability to gain back what I'm down by just closing out now.\n\nNo I don't have the ability to place options and looking at the application on Merrill Lunch it doesn't seem like I would qualify.\n\nIDK... I was even thinking of just closing everything out and hoping to regain some loses if there's still room to run, closing and buying 1000 perhaps... but boy would that suck if it went down... taking the loses only to buy and it turn out to be a downtrend. Seeing as I don't mind holding on to for awhile it seems the odds of the price going down are more likely than up. At least at some point where i can exit and reduce some of the loses.\n\nI do appreciate you taking the time to read and any advice. No this isn't my life savings or immediate funds I need to make ends meet, but part of it was vacation money. And I'm fine by missing vacation myself, but this is really making me feel like shit as it was more been about taking my gf somewhere for our two year anniversary, and I've already done tons of planning... just haven't finalize bc of COVID concerns. She's single mom whose deadbeat ex hasn't paid child support in the last year and deserves a vaca too. Really upsets me the idea of not going after talking it up in the past few months... and although I'm sure I still will book the trip as a matter of principle.... I really shouldn't if I don't get back $10k on these 1700 shares. $7 drop would be a blessing. I was looking to so if there was some consult option on Merrill but it looks like on ongoing advisory service not a consult option.\n\nAnyway, thanks for listening and and or anyone who may have something helpful to offer, not simply pointing out the obvious fact I clearly made errors and shouldn't be messing with shorting.", "id": "nq7611", "created_utc": 1622588550.0, "score": 10, "upvote_ratio": 0.59, "num_comments": 85, "comments": [{"body": "There are plenty of stock to short, don’t short a meme stock.

{"title": "Is AirBnb ($ABNB) Ready to Moon Post Covid?", "selftext": "Wanted to share some thoughts on AirBnB, as we just talked about this on our latest Podcast.\n\n$ABNB is going to be turning into a juggernaut post-Covid and be the service type of company people thought UBER was going to be. Not only does $ABNB want to be the leader in vacation stays but also be the company to take care of you during your whole vacation from flights/Rail, ridesharing, drinks/food/goods with delivery.\n\nDid you forget your toothpaste? $ABNB has someone deliver it to our door within an hour. Want some wine and dinner waiting for you at your Airbnb stay the moment you arrive? Boom done… If Airbnb got into the airline's space they would do a thing called wet-leasing which If Airbnb decided to wet-lease aircraft, they would not necessarily see the same startup costs a traditional airline would see and it would allow for them to ‘proof’ their concept before buying planes for themselves. $ABNB has the cash to make all this happen with 3.5B cash on hand to potentially create a vacation/outlet super app that is only just going to keep growing post-Covid. They even have the cash to buy YELP for 3.5B with YELP market cap at 3B so $ABNB can get into the reviews space and make it better by putting it on the Airbnb app while running ads creating a new revenue stream and cornering the review market forcing people to go into the Airbnb app where they could end up booking dinner even near home using the app while seeing Airbnb ads making them think they could use a vacation and book it while they are having dinner.\n\nThe thing they can work on is the Airbnb experiences and scale this up to be a big part of the revenue. Try the Amazon prime model with a membership to get “discounts” on food/stays and also these experiences to entice users to try it out. Flat discounts on products, probably additional bundled discounts for multiple services. Perks can be things like discounted ridesharing and goods delivered anywhere in the world as ABNB potentially partners with the major players in ridesharing/delivery as well as airline space. The reward program is easy; you can already establish a hotel-style reward program and layer in other benefits as you expand into other industries. Many companies will still be paying for employees to travel in the future.\n\nLocking in big corporations with a membership that gives them prime pricing on flights, hospitality, etc. will yield big, consistent revenues - and make Travel & Expenses (T&E) much better. Also speaking of hospitality, ABNB could partner with some hotels and retrofit some better rooms and charge a high price than have the hotel take care of the cleaning and collect the cleaning fee so both parties win in this and hotels know ABNB can kill their business long term so join forces and not get wiped out.\n\nOverall I think YELP acquisition would be the smartest move they can make in the short term and forget about wet-leasing planes for a few years until the balance sheet gets healthier post-Covid and fully recover but the acquisition of YELP with the cash wouldn't add debt and would increase user base numbers while providing extra revenue streams. One key stat to pay attention to is the average stay on Airbnb is now 28 days so it is not just weekend getaways/vacations but for living as well. Now that the lockup period expired and those who wanted to get out shares have done so, now the selling pressure should dry up in the mid 100s and we go back to the 200s.\n\nPounding The Table Podcast\n\n\\-Reilly", "id": "npzbz9", "created_utc": 1622568206.0, "score": 91, "upvote_ratio": 0.73, "num_comments": 85, "comments": [{"body": "It's not going to the moon in the sense that term is used, their IPO was in December and they hit over 200 during the pandemic.
