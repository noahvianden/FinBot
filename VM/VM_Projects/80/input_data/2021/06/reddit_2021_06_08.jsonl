{"title": "Deutsche Bank warns of global ‘time bomb’ coming due to rising inflation", "selftext": " Inflation may look like a problem that will go away, but is more likely to persist and lead to a crisis in the years ahead, according to a warning from Deutsche Bank economists.\n\nIn a forecast that is well outside the consensus from policymakers and Wall Street, Deutsche issued a dire warning that focusing on stimulus while dismissing inflation fears will prove to be a mistake if not in the near term then in 2023 and beyond.\n\nThe analysis especially points the finger at the Federal Reserve and its new framework in which it will tolerate higher inflation for the sake of a full and inclusive recovery. The firm contends that the Fed’s intention not to tighten policy until inflation shows a sustained rise will have dire impacts.\n\n**Deutsche Bank says**\n\n“The consequence of delay will be greater disruption of economic and financial activity than would be otherwise be the case when the Fed does finally act,” Deutsche’s chief economist, David Folkerts-Landau, and others wrote. “In turn, this could create a significant recession and set off a chain of financial distress around the world, particularly in emerging markets.”\n\nAs part of its approach to inflation, the Fed won’t raise interest rates or curtail its asset purchase program until it sees “substantial further progress” toward its inclusive goals. Multiple central bank officials have said they are not near those objectives.\n\nIn the meantime, indicators such as the consumer price and personal consumption expenditures price indices are well above the Fed’s 2% inflation goal. Policymakers say the current rise in inflation is temporary and will abate once supply disruptions and base effects from the early months of the coronavirus pandemic crisis wear off.\n\nThe Deutsche team disagrees, saying that aggressive stimulus and fundamental economic changes will present inflation ahead that the Fed will be ill-prepared to address.\n\n“It may take a year longer until 2023 but inflation will re-emerge. And while it is admirable that this  \npatience is due to the fact that the Fed’s priorities are shifting towards social goals, neglecting inflation leaves global economies sitting on a time bomb,” Folkerts-Landau said. “The effects could be devastating, particularly for the most vulnerable in society.”\n\n## To be sure, the Deutsche position is not widely held by economists.\n\nMost on Wall Street agree with the Fed’s view that current inflation pressures are transitory, and they doubt there will be any policy changes soon.\n\nJan Hatzius, chief economist at Goldman Sachs, said there are “strong reasons” to support the position. One he cites is the likelihood that the expiration of enhanced unemployment benefits will send workers back to their jobs in the coming months, easing wage pressures.\n\nOn price pressures in general, Hatzius said that much of current spike is being driven by “the unprecedented role of outliers” that will ebb and bring levels back closer to normal.\n\n“All this suggests that Fed officials can stick with their plan to exit only very gradually from the easy current policy stance,” Hatzius wrote.\n\nThat will be a mistake, according to the Deutsche view.\n\nCongress has approved more than $5 trillion in pandemic-related stimulus so far, and the Fed has nearly doubled its balance sheet, through monthly asset purchases, to just shy of $8 trillion. The stimulus continues to come through even with an economy that is expected to grow at about a 10% pace in the second quarter and an employment picture that has added an average 478,000 jobs a month in 2021.\n\n“Never before have we seen such coordinated expansionary fiscal and monetary policy. This will continue as output moves above potential,” Folkers-Landau said. “This is why this time is different for inflation.”\n\nThe Deutsche team said the coming inflation could resemble the 1970s experience, a decade during which inflation averaged nearly 7% and was well into double digits at various times. Soaring food and energy prices along with the end of price controls helped push that era’s soaring inflation.\n\nThen-Fed Chairman Paul Volcker led the effort to squash inflation then, but needed to use dramatic interest rate hikes that triggered a recession. The Deutsche team worries that such a scenario could play out again.\n\n“Already, many sources of rising prices are filtering through into the US economy. Even if they are transitory on paper, they may feed into expectations just as they did in the 1970s,” they said. “The risk then, is that even if they are only embedded for a few months they may be difficult to contain, especially with stimulus so high.”\n\nThe firm said interest rate hikes could “cause havoc in a debt-heavy world,” with financial crises likely particularly in emerging economies where growth won’t be able to overcome higher financing costs.\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/07/deutsche-bank-warns-of-global-time-bomb-coming-due-to-rising-inflation.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/07/deutsche-bank-warns-of-global-time-bomb-coming-due-to-rising-inflation.html)", "id": "nvalf2", "created_utc": 1623176195.0, "score": 229, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 82, "comments": [{"body": "lol you mean these guys?  \n\n\n[https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/deutsche-bank-agrees-pay-over-130-million-resolve-foreign-corrupt-practices-act-and-fraud](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/deutsche-bank-agrees-pay-over-130-million-resolve-foreign-corrupt-practices-act-and-fraud)  \n\n\n[https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-former-deutsche-bank-traders-charged-deceptive-and-manipulative-trading-practices-us](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-former-deutsche-bank-traders-charged-deceptive-and-manipulative-trading-practices-us)  \n\n\n[https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8185-20](https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8185-20)  \n\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-deutsche-mirrortrade-probe-idUSKBN15F1GT](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-deutsche-mirrortrade-probe-idUSKBN15F1GT)  \n\n\n[https://fcpablog.com/2019/08/22/deutsche-bank-pays-sec-16-million-to-settle-referral-hiring/](https://fcpablog.com/2019/08/22/deutsche-bank-pays-sec-16-million-to-settle-referral-hiring/)  \n\n\nand on and on and on and on....  \n\n\nHow the FUCK are these guys a Bank?

Any unpredicted change in behavior will cause market volatility, since bets will fail. Either investors will loose value through under-hedged bets, or hedge funds will loose money from over-hedged bets. As a consequence of this with the rise of market uncertainty, investing willingness and risk taking, will probably also lower, causing the market to generally slow down. This probably goes into a market decrease, as the overhead of driving the market, might become under-saturated from the decreased velocity of the market.\n\nAdditionally the inflation will cause a lot of low-middle class consumers to have less spending power, which will decrease the overall velocity of money, and on average the revenue of the entire consumer based market. \n\nDemand driven and hyped stocks who's value are based on \"sure they don't produce any money right now, but they will in just a moment\", (confidence based stocks), will probably risk a sharp decline in value, as overall market confidence decreases. \n\nI'd say the real risk, are companies that are driven very tightly financially, as they risk going over the edge during the instability. Confidence based assets (that aren't driven too tightly), might decrease sharply in value, but will eventually bounce bark as the market recovers, and they continue on realizing their actual value. \n\nBest approach as I see it, is to follow Warren Buffets strategy of investing in companies that have financial room for instability, and good long term prospects. Additionally keeping a highly liquid 'opportunity fund', in relatively stable assets, enables you to take advantage of the actually great stocks, which will take a temporary hit during a crash of any kind.\n\nI guess if the bet is that USD inflation is going to accelerate, moving to companies based on non (less) USD-bound currencies (as if there really were any), would be the play. I **think** the risk is more based on an unchecked sustained high inflation rate, which I'm not as sure about how to interpret mitigation on. \n\nRight now, I think it's hard to say which companies will initially be affected by market instability. It's easier to say which companies won't be affected as much by it in the long run.

We are NOT in the same situation, now the chip shortage may contribute to inflation in some way but realistically it won't last more than the next couple of years. One X factor I will throw out in thier defence is the possibility wages will rise, as many industries are now desperately hiring and some growing rapidly we could see wage rises as the primary driver of inflation.

{"title": "This Is Why the Plaid+ Was Cancelled - SPECULATION", "selftext": "The Plaid was originally intended to be a 2170 battery based car (the same battery that is in the Model 3/Y vs the 18650 battery currently in the previous - and older - Model S/X platforms). Since the announcement of the Plaid and Plaid+, the 4680 battery production has ramped up and achieved viability ahead of schedule. As a result, the Plaid will feature BOTH the 4680 battery and a structural battery pack - and we could see higher range than originally anticipated. As a result of the 4680 making it into the Plaid, the Plaid+ was cancelled.\n\nHere are the little bits of evidence pointing towards the early deployment of the 4680:\n\n* The Model S Plaid (4766lbs) weighs less than the older 18650 based Model S (4941lbs) for the performance model. 4680 structural battery means less dead weight from casings and the battery serving dual purpose for structural rigidity (as well as being batteries).\n* The newer Model S costs less than the older Model S to build, per Q1 conference call comments by Elon Musk - DESPITE featuring an additional motor, additional rear screen and next-gen console performance level GPUs. Structural battery pack, megacastings and the 4680 battery especially key to being able to push down production costs - enough to overcome the additional goodies that come with the Plaid S? maybe.\n* Tesla has accelerated battery production permitting and production equipment ordering and installation. At the same time, no 4680 batteries have been shipped to Berlin that we know of. The pilot production line at Kato road has been producing batteries for months now, and Tesla has stated its production capacity is \\~5GWh. If Tesla isn't shipping these batteries to Berlin, what are they using them for? 5GWh is enough to supply up to 50,000 units per year of the Plaid assuming 100kWh battery packs going into the Plaid.\n\nThis is all my personal speculation - I'll look real dumb on Thursday when Elon says there's nothing special about the Plaid's battery pack.
