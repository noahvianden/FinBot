But until Tesla reach a point where they have enough factories that they don‚Äôt have to ship cars around the globe, there will continue to be lumpiness. \n\nFor example, European cars have different lights, airbags, electrical standards, charging connectors, etc. So the production line needs to do a ‚Äòrun‚Äô of a type of vehicle before pausing and switching parts and doing another ‚Äòrun‚Äô of production to be most efficient. \n\nIt makes sense logistically to do all European cars at once, if you do it early in the quarter so you can put them on boats, send them across the Atlantic, and actually deliver them in the same financial reporting period. Otherwise you show huge operating expenses (producing vehicles) but if the boats don‚Äôt arrive by end of quarter (no sales) then it looks like you‚Äôre making a massive loss (spending on materials and labour) in the quarter. \n\nSo stock price and the logistics of serving the entire market from just 2 factories is ultimately the limitation preventing a smoother cadence.
