{"title": "The pretense of knowledge: my bear thesis.", "selftext": "***\"The future is better foretold in the streets than in the morning news\"***\n\nOne thing I'm exploring lately is how people on the ground tend to have a better read on things than \"experts\".  Obviously this is not always the case, and I think when it comes to things like Covid and stuff it's best just to follow the restrictions and what not.  But immunology is deeply rooted in science, and is easily testable.\n\nI have a degree in economics, so I'm not one to sling the profession through the mud.  But I think that some economists are attempting to bring a degree to certainty to the field that simply is not realistic.  F.A. Hayek talked about this.  Economist William White, who predicted the '08 crash, also talked about this.  I'm not the only one saying it.\n\nI recently read in a book, *The Shadow of the Wind,* by Carlos Ruis Zafón, a passage that struck me.  I will provide the original text in Spanish, for those who speak it, as his words are far more beautiful than my subpar translation:\n\n*\"Era un buen lector de la historia y sabía que el futuro se leía en las calles, las factorías y los cuarteles con más claridad que en la prensa de la mañana\"*\n\n*\"He had a good read on the future, and he knew that the future was better foretold in the streets, in the factories, and in the troop quarters than in the morning news.\"*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The '08 Crisis**\n\nWhen the real estate bubble burst in '06, and the financial system came toppling down in '07-'08, economists and central bankers were left scratching their head.  They would eventually say that it was impossible to see this coming, but in the [Federal Crisis Inquiry Commission report](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-FCIC/pdf/GPO-FCIC.pdf), they debunked this, and said that there was plenty of warning.\n\nPeople on the ground at mortgage originator firms saw it coming.  Consumer advocacy groups saw it coming.  People at ratings agencies saw it coming.  But at all levels they were ignored.  There was an assumption that somehow, via technology and financial engineering, we had beaten the system and unlocked a new paradigm.\n\nBut Michael J. Burry saw it coming.  He was a bit of an outsider, and it's no surprise to me that he would be the one to take a wider look at things and say, \"wait a minute\".\n\nPeter Schiff saw it coming.  I have mixed feelings about him, as he has strong (and oftentimes incorrect, IMO) political views.  But what I like about Schiff is that he doesn't pull any punches.  He didn't buy it when Bernanke said \"subprime is contained\".  A lot of people did.  The market did.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2021 - Anecdotes from the ground**\n\nMy mom traded in her car yesterday and she told me she was surprised that the were willing to give her $11,000 for it.  It wasn't in bad condition, but this amount was surprisingly high to both of my parents.\n\nShe told me that a year or so ago they took the car into the shop because it was making a funny noise.  They paid a lot of money to have it checked out, but no problem or solution was found.  My mom mentioned this to the people at the dealership, and they even took it for a test drive.  No problem.  They were willing to give her the full $11,000, no more questions asked.\n\nTo me this looks like speculative behavior.  Used car prices are going through the roof due to, not only decreased supply, but more importantly to *increased demand*, with so much free money sloshing around in the system. And since prices keep going up and up, the dealers were eager to buy her car so that they could later flip it, regardless of the state it was in.  Sound familiar?\n\nHow about Warren Buffet saying he's seeing massive price increases all across the board?\n\nWhat about the boom in that which shall not be named in this sub? Look at the meme stocks.  Look at Archegos.  Look at Tesla.  Speculation is running rampant right now.  Last night I heard Josh Brown on CNBC say \"let's not overcomplicate it, it's goin' north!\"  Ie, the trend is up right now, so it's going to keep going up.  What in the world kind of analysis is that?\n\nIn addition, the S+P 500 hasn't had a serious downturn since 2008... remember, stocks always go up, right?  Covid doesn't count.  It barely scratched the market, and the rebound has been insane.\n\nI follow a channel on YouTube called Everything Money (highly recommended, this sub won't let me link it).  The main analyst, Paul, has been investing since just before the dot-com bubble.  He knows that it's NOT normal for stocks to always go up.  This guy isn't an economist.  He's not a new investor.  He's not some pundit.  He's an investor who has been battle-tested.  He's a guy on the ground.  He knows this isn't normal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Stubbornness of Ineffective Paradigms**\n\nIn my own job as an English-as-a-foreign-language teacher, I have seen how many teachers stubbornly cling to ineffective methods that don't work.  I had one friend today tell me that \"this is coming from a place of ignorance, but I don't think their method of focusing on grammar works\". I told him, in this case, your ignorance is more insightful than their \"expert\" methodology.  He is correct, as my best students are those who do less grammar and have more exposure to real English.\n\nIt is the teachers who think they have to micromanage their students' learning who simply end up getting in the way.  We can't engineer the ability to speak a foreign language... all we can do is provide contact to it, and just like a baby learning their native tongue, eventually it starts happening.  Yet teachers cling to the false notion that it is through their deliberate efforts that students will learn.\n\nAnd if such an ineffective paradigm can persist so stubbornly in this environment, why not in others?  How about the war on drugs?  Can we simply force people to stop taking drugs?  Does it make any sense?  No.  But people don't like to change their views - they cling to them.  And I believe economists, the Fed, and the market are clinging to the view that we can predict the market, and as long as we make the right adjustments (via QE and fiscal policy), we will be OK.\n\nF.A. Hayek would call this \"the pretense of knowledge\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI don't know what's going to happen, and hey, I could be wrong.  Maybe stocks will always go up and we'll just avoid any major crises from here on out.  It could happen.\n\nThe issue is that the bulls and the central bankers never even seem to posit the idea that \"hey, I could be wrong\".  To them it's science.  Physics.  Math.  That's the economy; that's the market.\n\nBut the market is not science.  We can do our best to try and understand it, but IMO, part of having a true understanding of it is realizing that we will never be able to figure it out entirely, and then planning our policies in such a way that takes into account our limitations.\n\nI'm predicting that this situation is not sustainable, and I'm predicting that we are going to see some sort of crisis in some ways comparable to 2008.  I believe that ultra-easy monetary policy and the resulting extraordinary levels of public and private debt are going to end up causing some sort of crisis.  I also believe that inflation will be a problem, and perhaps a serious one.\n\nI'm not shorting anything because I recognize that I could be wrong.  I'm still learning and developing my theory every day.  But I am playing things very, very conservatively.\n\nI am going to take the step to post this, because by taking a position I will either learn through being correct, or learn by being proven wrong.   The worst thing anyone can do is take no position at all and neither succeed nor fail at anything, and thus guarantee that they never learn or advance in any way whatsoever.\n\nGood luck to everyone.", "id": "nqplrb", "created_utc": 1622650761.0, "score": 68, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 78, "comments": [{"body": "Let me respond to some individual points to spark up a conversation:\n\n(As a general point, I agree 100% that you need to ignore the narrative and think independently).\n\n>There was an assumption that somehow, via technology and financial engineering, we had beaten the system and unlocked a new paradigm.\n\nOK, so what is the prevailing \"new paradigm\" right now?

It barely scratched the market, and the rebound has been insane.\n\nWell, yes, unprecedented, but pay attention to what Warren Buffett said in the 2021 AGM: the situation looked quite different before the Fed stepped in. We can debate whether or not they should have done that (they could have let corporations fall into distress with their debt funding). But what March 2020 shows is that the market can still react and draw down very violently if prospects for business conditions worsen dramatically. It's just that given how the powers that be handled the crisis, business conditions today don't look anything like they did in March 2020 (or September 2008).\n\n>I told him, in this case, your ignorance is more insightful than their \"expert\" methodology. \n\nYes, \"expert\" is a vague designation. People have their varying levels of knowledge, competence and their incentives (either personal or professional or both). Warren Buffett risked his reputation by going against the narrative in his Sun Valley speech in 1999 and then subsequently again several times in the early 2000s. I would call him an expert on business, stocks and even markets and the economy. The ordinary \"experts\" however, don't have his fame, abilities, dedication or financial freedom to think independently and speak freely.\n\n>And I believe economists, the Fed, and the market are clinging to the view that we can predict the market, and as long as we make the right adjustments (via QE and fiscal policy), we will be OK.\n\nRight, they have no idea what's going to happen, nobody does. Charlie Munger said \"there's one very intelligent man who thinks it's dangerous and that's just the start.\"\n\n>I believe that ultra-easy monetary policy and the resulting extraordinary levels of public and private debt are going to end up causing some sort of crisis. I also believe that inflation will be a problem, and perhaps a serious one.\n\nYou can try to protect against inflation to an extent with your investments. I agree that the level of debt (this time, public debt) is unprecedented and I would mostly echo Druckenmiller that there is no way that the government is going to put 30% of tax revenue into debt service (which is what 5% or higher interest rates would mean).

Thanks u/shortyafter and u/snake250 for the interesting and thought provoking discussion. \n\nI tend to agree with op. Although I look at it from a more macro scale, and my background is not economics so I come at it from a slightly different angle. \n\nPersonally, I think the fundamental problem (as well as the biggest underlying issue that I think makes your thesis correct) is that we are running into resource constraints. The original thesis of the American market system (and capitalism) is constant, unending growth. It’s not physically possible, at least in our current carbon based, extractive system. And yes, that’s about as close to a scientifically “proven” fact as anything. \n\nThere are too many people on this planet, at least considering the level of resource consumption of the western world (and to a rapidly increasing degree, the eastern world too). We are in the midst of a forced evolution, due to the climate crisis, complete with chaos and upheaval in the form of heatwaves, droughts, storms, fires, floods, and yes, pandemics. That’s not even mentioning the secondary effects of water wars, refugee crises, and the collapse of civil society— including the collapse of the rule of law, the insurance system (things become uninsurable), and authoritarianism rises. \n\nLeaving aside the climate science, “peak oil” is an accepted thesis even among the oil companies of the world. Yes, now there’s natural gas, but let’s not kid ourselves into thinking it’s limitless. We are seeing resource constraints for the minerals used to make solar panels, batteries, and other electronics. Lumbar, cement, and steel. \n\nThe way I see this playing out differs depending on how optimistic and hopeful I’m feeling. Usually not very, unfortunately. But I don’t kid myself into thinking the “market” will just go away. There will continue to be winners and losers, even if the day to day game is punctuated by increasingly common, as well as severe, black swan events. \n\nI also believe that we, the ever more prevalent (and together, powerful) retail investors can put our money towards creating the future that we want to see.

It spiked because people got laid off, and it began to decline as we learned to handle the new situation and things slowly began to get back to normal.  That's not volatile - it's predictable.  The point is that Covid *was* a major disruption.  We're still not back to where we were.  \n\nYou also to remember that not everybody has recovered as quickly as the US.

This has a huge effect on the US and global supply chains as well.\n\n>Moreover the unemployment rate today is not really comparable to other unemployment rates of the past.

You usually see a trend up when leading into and during recessions and economic crises, not a spike up and then a spike right back down in a few short months.\n\n>Again, you're proving my point. What's good about an employee shortage? \n\nNot really.\n\nYou need to look at fundamentally why unemployment is normally historically a bad thing.\n\nUnemployment is bad because it's usually due to a *labor* shortage and generally means people on average have less money to spend and will drastically cut back on spending thus, reflecting poorly on company profits. People aren't willingly not working as much as they're forced out of work with no real income. Thus stock market go down.\n\nAn employee shortage where people don't want or need to go back to work doesn't reflect this. People are getting money from other sources, thus spending does not decrease, ergo company profits remain stable despite people not working, as we again see in a lot of sectors in the past year. This would only be catastrophic if we were seeing mass shutdowns of businesses across the country which we aren't seeing yet.\n\n>That means people aren't producing things,\n\nClearly not really the case. Again read my article. US manufacturing is not really impacted, hell the US imports most of the shit these days anyways and most companies outsource their actual production overseas. Production hasn't really been shown to have slowed down except semiconductors but that's not really a US employment problem but a covid caused issue that once again is primarily produced overseas, not here. You'll notice that the areas that are having the most trouble finding employees are low wage jobs, not higher earning positions. Nobody's trying to take 31k/year in unemployment for opportunities in jobs offering 50k+ or more with benefits.\n\n>but I still don't believe that breaking even with GDP justifies the meteoric rise in the stock market.\n\nAgain, the S&P 500 has never gone up by the same degree as the GDP.

Thinking to yourself \"we're surely not at the bottom yet.\" Meanwhile, someone who invested today might see their equity balance drop back to today's levels (or a bit less or a bit more) and then recover (depending on the continued rise leading up to a crash).\n\nMake no mistake - the market continues to go up. It doesn't do so in a straight line, but sitting on the sidelines waiting to time a bottom is a fool's errand.

There's a difference between trying to time the market through prognostication (i.e., assuming that a downturn is forthcoming) and simply refusing to buy something at too high a price, which is diagnostic and has nothing to do with timing. If something is too expensive to buy, then I would choose not to buy it on that merit alone---the presumption of whether it will be more affordable in the future is irrelevant. If it's not, I still won't buy it. Regardless of valuations, I robotically throw a chunk of my monthly pay into market indices without a second thought---I pretend I never had it to begin with so there are no worries there. If the bull market runs endlessly then I won't be missing out. I just won't be as wealthy as I would've been if I YOLO'd everything into the market.\n\nAll I know is that in my examination of individual stocks and the market at large, I find it hard to deny that U.S. stocks are generally far too expensive with only a few exceptions, at least by historical standards. For this reason, I'm going very conservative with what I control outside of the retirement account. If prices never drop, then my retirement will assure that my nest egg grows unabated. If they do drop, then I can revisit my watchlists and spreadsheets to see how things stack up in the moment---diagnosis. If something appears fairly or undervalued in the moment, then I would feel compelled to make a purchase. That's not timing anything. It's just looking at the price tag and making a determination on whether it's fair or not.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Words of wisdom.
