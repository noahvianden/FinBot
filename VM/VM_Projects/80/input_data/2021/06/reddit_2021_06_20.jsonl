Like if the energy density isn't good enough, why even bother in the first place?\n\n2.8 kWh/L on it's own is good enough I think, but you're right that this doesn't even cover the fuel cells which is needed to extract that energy. The batteries come with that included. If you look at the Model S it's battery is around 540 kg and that's enough to supply 1000 hp to the engines in the plaid. That's 1.4 kW/kg.\n\nThe weight of the engines themselves is not that important for this comparison because both fuel cells and batteries can use the same electric engines.\n\nIn this article they say fuel cell specific power is 1.6 kW/kg.\n\n[https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fenrg.2019.00035/full](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fenrg.2019.00035/full)\n\nThey also talk about a theoretical 8 kW/kg (because 1.6 kW/kg was probably not good enough). It's weird how Wikipedia lists 0.34 kW/kg for batteries, but it's a source from 10 years ago and 1.4 kW/kg batteries you can buy right now in a Model S Plaid. There's large scale manufacturing and it's mature technology.\n\nI don't even know if you can find 1.6 kW/kg fuel cells, they said that's \"state-of-the-art\" but can you manufacturer enough to make an airplane out of it? The fact that they don't even mention the PRICE of these technologies. Like this is for a commercial product and if you can't even get a price for your product, it's a long way away.\n\nDigging through their sources they list this website for that 1.6 kW/kg figure, but they don't show prices,  [https://www.intelligent-energy.com/our-products/](https://www.intelligent-energy.com/our-products/uavs/)\n\n[https://www.intelligent-energy.com/uploads/product\\_docs/IE-Soar\\_2.4kW\\_new.pdf](https://www.intelligent-energy.com/uploads/product_docs/IE-Soar_2.4kW_new.pdf)\n\nThis one is actually pretty decent at 8000W peak power at 4.4 kg fuel cell.\n\nHere's something that at least somewhat comparable with a price shown, [https://www.fuelcellstore.com/fuel-cell-stacks/uav-fuel-cell-stacks/g-hfcs-2kw25v-1kw-hydrogen-fuel-cell-power-generator](https://www.fuelcellstore.com/fuel-cell-stacks/uav-fuel-cell-stacks/g-hfcs-2kw25v-1kw-hydrogen-fuel-cell-power-generator)\n\n$11.5k for 2 kW (at 5.8 kg).\n\nMeanwhile doing some conversion for batteries with $100/kWh, 0.25 kWh/kg, 1.4 kW/kg it becomes $18/kW. That number is actually totally feasible even though it's a very rough estimate.\n\n[https://www.amazon.com/TATTU-1800mAh-Battery-Racing-Drones/dp/B013I9SAHO/](https://www.amazon.com/TATTU-1800mAh-Battery-Racing-Drones/dp/B013I9SAHO/)\n\n11.1V, 1800 mAh, 45C rated that's 899 W and the battery costs $21 off Amazon, pretty damn close to $18/kW. That initial paper mentions 27.6 MW is the required power for current aircafts. In batteries that would cost $500,000 while for fuel cells it's $159 million. The entire aircraft is supposed to cost less than $100 million.\n\nFuel cells are just not technically ready, while batteries clearly are. The energy density isn't technically ready for batteries either, but at $5800/kW fuel cells aren't technology ready for anything really.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "What is often forgotten is that the tanks and fool cells also add a lot of weight to the system, not to mention that the volumetric density is not great either when all stuffed together. The system as a whole actually weighs quite a lot, almost comparable to batteries, and it takes up a lot of space. Then on top of that because the fool cell is far from 100% efficient, it's more like 60%, it generates tons and tons of heat.\n\nLet's say you wanted to use fool cells for a plane. Normally the engine operates at extremely high temperatures and it's basically air cooled plus some evaporation cooling in the fan blades. If you were to have electric motors the maximum temperature you're able to operate at is maybe 90 degrees C before the motors give up. If you have 95% efficient motors you might be able to cool most of it with the cold air going through the fan and some of it you can divert and use the wings as a heat sink, but if you have another 8x heating power to get rid off things just break down.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "540.0 kg is 1189.43 lbs", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "The example shown were bike and leisure boat ( like coastal line fishing boat ).

{"title": "CCS- The Company Making a Shit Ton of Cash Currently, and that will make a metric shit ton of cash in the future. The Deeply Undervalued Stock That's The Supreme Anti Inflation Play.", "selftext": "Alright, I am going to show you guys a company that is deeply undervalued by the metrics of Benjamin Graham and Warren Buffet to make you a gangbuster return. I know right, that is SO DIFFERENT than like 97% of the companies that get hawked here. You see, unlike the money losing companies that get hawked here with the expectation that they will lose slightly LESS money next year (or, even better, the ones that just lose even more money as the years go on), this one not only makes a shit ton of cash but will make a METRIC fuck ton of cash next year and EVEN MORE the year after. Golly, that would be a sight, am I right?\n\nSo, what is this magical stock called? Well, say it with me, it is Century Communities Stock (CCS). What does it do? It is a homebuilder (The 9th largest one across 17 states). One that was (gasp) profitable in 2008 (18 years of consecutive profit)!\n\nThey operate through two home building segments. The first is called **Century Communities** which is their ‚Äúflagship brand, offering everything from single-family floor plans to condos and townhomes. Enjoy the freedom to build and personalize your new home from the ground up or find the perfect quick move-in listing.‚Äù These homes are 1) To-be-built and quick move in homes, have2) full smart home packaging, and 3) can be reserved online. The second offering is **Century Complete** which are affordable and streamlined homes that Century makes that offer built in savings through a groundbreaking online purchase process and a versatile selection of quick move-in homes. This segment offers quick move-in homes, starter smart home packaging, and the ability to buy them online. They also do home loan, title insurance, and home insurance.\n\nLet us do a highlight reel before we get into the nitty gritty. They have delivered 10,386 new homes for the last twelve months through quarter 1 of 2021, and 80 percent of their deliveries are to entry level buyers (the largest segment of purchasers). Those home deliveries helped them notch 3.6B in total revenues for LTM 1Q 2021.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Valuation Metrics for CCS for Q1 2021**\n\nCentury Communities reached a net homebuilding debt to net capital of 19.9% from 52% in 2018. Their homebuilding debt to LTM EBITDA is 2.0X.\n\nTheir Book Value per share is 40.74, and tangible book value per share is 39.83. Yes, you see how they do not have much of that squishy ‚Äúgoodwill‚Äù or ‚Äúintangibles.‚Äù This stock is a straight shooter. That entails a 1.52 Price to Book Ratio, and a 1.55 Tangible Price to Book ratio.\n\nThe trailing P/E ratio for this company is a stunning 7.54 P/E ratio with a dividend yield of .95% (60 cents a year). Fully year EPS for 2021 on an average basis is 11.64, and 12.72 for 2022. **That means a Forward P/E ratio of 5.32 for 2021, and 4.875 for 2022.**\n\nTheir price to sales ratio is .47.\n\nAnalysts have an average price target of 92.\n\nIt is a steal, and I am going to explain further down why I believe analysts are wrong, and it is even more of a steal than they say. But before I do that, I am going to compare this stock to its peers.\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Comparison to Other Homebuilder Stocks**\n\nLennar has a P/E Ratio of 9.10 (After recently reporting its Q2 Earnings on Wednesday), a 2022 Forward P/E ratio of 7.41, and a 2023 forward P/E ratio of 7.23.\n\nToll Brothers has a P/E Ratio of 13.38, a 2022 Forward P/E Ratio of 6.70, and a 2023 Forward P/E ratio of 6.91.\n\nBut Hani, the market cap of these companies is much bigger! Fine, fine, let‚Äôs look at home builders with a market cap similar to CCS then!\n\nMeritage Homes has a P/E ratio of 7.54, a 2022 forward p/e of 5.46, and a forward 2023 p/e ratio of 6.62.\n\nThe only home builder that comes close is M/I homes but it has a future P/E that lower than that of CCS, and it is in slightly less markets. Still, it is a strong buy as well.\n\nI cannot be bothered to compare every homebuilder stock but suffice to say it is better than KB homes, NVR, D.R. Horton, Tri Pointe Homes, and PulteGroup. In short, it‚Äôs undervalued in a sector that is being undervalued by the markets. The only stock that comes close, or slightly edges it out is M/I Homes (which doesn‚Äôt offer a dividend).\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Lennar‚Äôs Earnings to shed light on the earnings of CCS.**\n\nOn Wednesday Lennar destroyed earnings with adjusted quarterly earnings of 2.95 per share. Stripping out items, it reported earnings of 2.65, which handily surpassed analyst estimates of 2.38 per share.\n\nThey also beat on revenues and issued an update to its homebuilding outlook for the third quarter and is now anticipating new orders in the rage of 16,000-16,300 units and ‚Äúdeliveries between 15,800 and 16,100 units for the new quarter.‚Äù\n\nThe Macro Commodity Outlook & Home Price Appreciation FY 2022\n\nTimber prices have made homes about 30,000-35,000 more expensive to build, but ever since they peaked on May 7th, at 1670 a unit they have gone down, and they have gone down fast. It closed on Friday at 904, and analysts believe it will continue to go down to roughly around 600. There are some analysts, however, that believe it could go as low as 500 to 550 and I share that sentiment. That is because DIY builders have largely stopped buying timber with the great opening, home builders are not going balls to the walls with their home building, and because sawmill operators are increasing capacity.\n\nBuilding construction accounts for nearly half of all copper use (and residential is roughly 2/3rds of building construction), and with China having announced it is releasing its metals reserve and trying to tamp it down copper has been coming off its highs faster than usual. Interestingly Copper also peaked on May 7th at 4.75, and it is most recent close was at 4.14.\n\nAluminum is used as an insulation layer of building roods, for windowpanes, etcetera. It peaked on May 7th as well and is now sitting roughly at 2384. I believe it will continue to decrease, due to China‚Äôs attempts to moderate the prices by releasing its reserves, as well as due to eventual balking by customers at the prices.\n\nMeanwhile, home prices will increase in 2022. Freddie Mac predicts that home prices will rise by 4.4% in 2022. In 2021, ‚ÄúHigher building costs, longer delivery times, and general unpredictability in the construction supply chain are now having measurable impacts on new home prices. The median sales price of new houses sold in April 2021 was $372,400, 20% higher than a year ago. The average sales price was $435,400. The seasonally adjusted estimate of new houses for sale at the end of April was 316,000. This represents a supply of 4.4 months at the current sales rate.‚Äù What am I getting at here? Well, there are currently bidding wars, and Lennar‚Äôs earnings calls will reinforce that. Homebuilders are passing off the cost, and the consumers are taking the increased cost. What is more, homebuilders are INCREASING their margin.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**HUGE undersupply of homes, and a huge ongoing need for new homes**\n\nFreddie/Fannie have predicted that there is a 3.8 MILLION undersupply of homes, and home builders will need to build 1.2M homes a year just to keep up with year-on-year demand. When I say 1.2M homes, that does not actually chip at the backlog. To cut into the inventory shortage of 3.8M they will need to build more than 1.2M homes a year.\n\nBut homebuilders are being cautious, and so it will take 8 to ten years to fill demand unless they ramp up significantly. Currently Housing Starts are only 1.572M units on a seasonally adjusted basis. Furthermore, permits for future homebuilding fell 3.0% to a rate of 1.681M units in May.\n\nLet me be clear then, that this is not a cyclical play, but a circumstance of over a decade of concentrated underbuilding by home builders that is now leading to a golden age for them in the coming years.\n\nWhat does this all mean for when CCS reports earnings in Q2 and for Q3 and Beyond (August)\n\nI am going to throw some quotes from Lennar‚Äôs earnings, and you can spot the goodies. READ IT ALL, but I will bold some things:\n\n**Jon Jaffe Co-Chief Executive Officer:** ‚ÄúQ4 of 2020 is when we saw the first significant increase in lumber costs, which impacted primarily our Q2 deliveries. **The lumber increases, which occurred in Q1 and Q2, will mostly flow through our deliveries in the second half of the year. But as we noted and Diane will cover more detail, we believe that Lennar's pricing power will more than offset this and we expect to deliver stronger gross margins. Looking forward, we expect to see some limited relief on our lumber costs for our July starts as more expensive lumber works its way through the system. And if the current downward trend holds, we'll see a more significant benefit for August starts.‚Äù**\n\n**Diane Bessette CFO:**  And now, let me provide some high-level guidance for the fiscal year. We still expect, as we mentioned, our deliveries to be between 62,000 and 64,000 homes\\*\\*, but with a now higher gross margin guidance of 26.5% to 27% for the year and an even more efficient operating platform with SG&A guidance of 7.3% to 7.5% for the year.\\*\\*\n\nSo, as you can see, this is fantastic news. The reporting period for Q2 for CCS ends on June 30th, which means I expect them to revise guidance upward for Q3-EOY in terms of margin because that is when the housing starts will start to fully benefit from decreased lumber prices (As well as other commodity prices). Furthermore, consumers are taking the price increases on the chin and allowing margin to expand as you can see in Lennar earning call as well as government data, and this is going to be seen as soon as this upcoming quarter as you can see by Lennar's earnings beat. I expect earnings to be at least 3 EPS, and maybe even more, beating the analyst consensus of 2.73. I expect FY EPS in 2021 of at least 12 dollars in earnings per share which beats the analyst consensus.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**The Anti-Inflation Play**\n\nThe rise in housing prices accounted for over a quarter of the overall increase in inflation in May ([An inflation storm is coming for the U.S. housing market | Morningstar](https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/20210619290/an-inflation-storm-is-coming-for-the-us-housing-market)). Guess, who that benefits. That is right, this stock.\n\nFurthermore, purchasing a home is the quintessential anti-inflation play because the mortgage stays the same over 30 years while rents increase to match inflation. Furthermore, your home appreciates roughly at the same rate as inflation when you are a home buyer. So, to beat inflation‚Ä¶ People buy homes.\n\nFinally, building costs are decreasing with commodity prices going lower, but margins are expanding. HMMM!!!!!\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Debt**\n\nCCS was upgraded to B1 by Moody‚Äôs on Feb 22, 2021, and put their outlook at positive. This is one step below investment grade.\n\nThey have no debt on their revolving line of credits, but they have two senior notes. 495M worth of notes due May 2027 u/6.,75%, and 397M worth of Senior Notes due July 2025 u/5.875%.\n\nThe 6.75% Notes means annual interest payments of 33.412M, while the 5.875% senior notes give an annual interest payment of 23.324M. This equates to roughly 56.74M in interest expenses. If they got rid of the debt, they would add an additional 1.68 to their EPS in the full year by removing that interest expense.\n\nAlternatively, they can get upgraded to investment grade by EOY and then choose to refinance for better rates and save on interest expense. After all, their set to almost reduce their net homebuilding debt to net capital to 0 by the end of this year (and that is if they only meet and do not surpass analyst expectations. I believe it‚Äôs only a matter of time before they are upgraded to investment grade debt due to the strong financials here.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Russel Inclusion**\n\nOn May 8 of 2020 was the Russel Ranking Day for reconstitution. The stock was 23.87$ at that time (clawing its way back from the doldrums of the pandemic lows). The Russel Ranking Day for 2021 was May 7th. The price then was 79.84. That is a 334.4% increase in the share price. The market cap, therefore, would have been 3.46B on ranking day. It will remain in the Russel 2000, with a much larger weighting as the higher on the list you are the higher your weighting is.\n\nSince then, however, it‚Äôs decreased roughly 28 percent to 62.01, which means that the weighting will have an outsize impact on the share price on the reconstitution date.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nInstitutional Ownership and Insider Ownership\n\nInstitutional ownership is 89.54%. Insiders own 11.9% of the company as well. This is pretty fucking bullish.\n\n[CCS 62.90 0.19 0.30% : Century Communities, Inc. - Yahoo Finance and 34 more pages - Personal - Microsoft‚Äã Edge (gyazo.com)](https://gyazo.com/aab400b34e4e2ae0b20989105905915d)\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**In conclusion**\n\nI have 220.57 Shares worth of CCS and 7 September 17 Calls for 65 dollars that I averaged down to 7.66 a pop. I intend to open a further, significant, amount on Monday provided there is not an explosion in the stock price as this is severely undervalued. Additionally, I think I‚Äôm going to open a smaller parallel position in M/I Homes. Price target by analysts is 92 dollars for CCS. The great homebuildergeddon of June 8-11 (Save for Lennar which boomed the day of earnings and the day after when JPMorgan initiated a price target with 50% upside), happened for literally no reason. It was just a sector bloodbath and CCS was hit the hardest of them all by far. Be aware that the bid asks for options is quite different, though not as illiquid as CNNE (My poor CNNE calls are getting slaughtered, but I have till August). This company is super undervalued and doesn‚Äôt deserve to be where it is.\n\nThis isn't a fucking pump and dump, don't make it one, because it doesn't deserve to be tarred by that association. This is a deep value play. I would have mentioned the 10% buyback authorization they have, but i don't care to because their focused on increasing earnings and making money hand over fist. Also, they should probably focus on removing all their debt notes, before doing share buybacks because it gives a better ROI.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n/u/fannypackphantom between my UWMC DD in March: [Enough with the techno mumbo jumbo A Fundamentalist Analysis of UWMC - Why I'm doubling Down : wallstreetbets (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m9frpz/enough_with_the_techno_mumbo_jumbo_a/), and this one I expect a nice flair if this pans out please and thank you.

You remember the lots also have to be readied for building, and home builders have economies of scale, where if you built it yourself you wouldn't. \n\nNew homes are pricier than old ones because 1) everything is new, and 2) There is a warranty for the big ticket repairs for a certain amount of time (at least there used to be). You can see it here: [https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/warranties-new-homes](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/warranties-new-homes) \n\nAs for everything: Vacation homes and WFH homes have been bought like crazy by people who have been able to keep their jobs during their pandemic. These people are largely white collar, with good jobs in tech, finance (etcetera). Because their jobs were secure, but they had to save at home, they got a very nice nest egg through savings. Simultaneously, tech stocks (and the broader market as a whole) had boomed. A lot of companies saw their RSU's value or stock grants value increase substantially, as well as their 401K's, IRA's, and taxable brokerages boom as well.\n\nFactor in record low mortgage interest rates, and you see these people going crazy over vacation homes, and second homes, or homes with a lower COL. \n\nWhat happens when there are more than 10 of them? Bidding wars, with things like all cash offers. \n\nIt's not that normal people, who can afford an 3.5% down or 5% down (FHA, VA, etc...) can't compete with the initial listing price. It's the massive bidding wars that they can't compete with, and that won't change until demand matches supply. Those people will STILL buy come 2022 or 2023, but because of the demand-supply imbalance they can't afford to pay ALL IN CASH in an offer and WAIVE CONTINGENCY which is what a lot of people are doing LMAO. Remember an all cash offer is king, and even better if you waive contingencies. Homes are being outbid, sight unseen! \n\nAdd to that is the fact that there are institutional investors who are buying up homes as well, and you get what you see. \n\nI don't expect a housing crash because mortgage underwriting standards are very strict now, especially with DTI verification.
