I have been watching baba for months and checked news, e/r and waited to see what gonna evolve regarding the stock and if and when i should enter. now i did, thats why.\n\ntoday i will be writing about alibaba stock \"BABA\" and exlplain my thesis regarding the underlying.\n\n# intro:\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Limited operates various segments including : core commerce, cloud, digital media, entertainment, payment services...\n\nbusiness which Alibaba group own: Taobao, TMALL, Freshipo, Lazada, Ali-express, Alibaba, ele,me, 1688, youku, alibaba-cloud, alimama, cainiao network, dingtalk, ant group, ali-pay\n\nAlibaba group does business in almost every thing you can imagine, therfore you can compare them to every big tech you know, they stand with the big dogs.(AMZN, GOOG, AAPL, MSFT) but they get less attention at the moment.  i think the sentiment towards alibaba is bound to change, very soon.\n\n**Why BABA ?, why now ?**\n\nbaba showed negative performance relative to the other tech stocks at the moment (market sentiment due to politics - alot of impact on the stock) . but baba strength can be seen in a few areas: revenue growth, solid financial position with reasonable debt and very reasonable and cheap valuation. the profit margins are lower when comparing to peers right now but baba business have much to grow and much to be expected to fix that issue.\n\nBaba stock experienced little decline in most recent quarter in comparison to performance from same quarter a year before, but i think the next earning this year will reveal growth in EPS.\n\nNow, lets start of with the basics and take a look on baba financial and valuation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# valuation:\n\n[https://postimg.cc/5XqrBJKp](https://postimg.cc/5XqrBJKp)\n\nso looking at valuations:\n\nMkrt value:  573B\n\np/e: \\~25x\n\nFp/e: \\~21x\n\np/s: \\~5.2x\n\np/b: \\~3.9x -> very attractive at this rate !\n\neps(ttm): 8.48\n\neps(ntm): \\~12\n\nnext e/r : Aug 19\n\n[https://postimg.cc/2b5gjtwG](https://postimg.cc/2b5gjtwG)\n\nAt BABA current stock price of $211, the market is expecting revenue to grow at 48.8% for the next 1 years. Over this period, BABA is also expected to generate an average Economic Earnings Margin of 13.8%\n\nBaba have increased theirlong term debt looking at their financials but due to increase in future revenue i believe it is nothing to be bothered by. debt is not an real issue to baba.\n\n\\*\\*very important note is that comparing baba to other big techs valuations at the moment proves that baba is dirty cheap and can be a good short/long term play . even is market goes sideways i dont see baba going any lower than right now. 200 price is pretty strong ressitence and still a good price.\n\nrevenue growth: 47.96%\n\neps growth : 14.42%\n\ni will be including a look into baba Assets and Liabilities, which i believe is showing us a healthy company which keep growing and expanding and inceasing their cashflow, revenue and shareholders equity.\n\n## Liabilities:\n\n[https://postimg.cc/s1vbtt1D](https://postimg.cc/s1vbtt1D)\n\n## Assets:\n\n[https://postimg.cc/5jTD1nF5](https://postimg.cc/5jTD1nF5)\n\n**Profitability:**\n\nProfitability in baba business is quite larger comparing to peers.\n\n[https://postimg.cc/k6hz2yYm](https://postimg.cc/k6hz2yYm)\n\n# analyst reports:\n\nmost of the ANALysts recommend this stock. various price targets between 260\\~350 price targets.\n\n[https://postimg.cc/7JGc0TjT](https://postimg.cc/7JGc0TjT)\n\n**and a few buying into: (including ark queen which i dont follow but nice to see)**\n\nalot of big hedgies hold baba, you can check it out.
