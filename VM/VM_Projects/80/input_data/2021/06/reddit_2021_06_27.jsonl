When talking about Tesla this often gets combined with driver assistance because Tesla pretty much uses autopilot to do both, in a sense autopilot is on all the time, and when driving manually it'll only assist in emergency (or avoiding emergency) situations.\n\nIt's true that eventually in fully autonomous cars we'll be able to drive with our hands off the wheel, but Tesla doesn't need your hands on the wheel to provide any input, it's just a way to make sure the driver is paying attention and ready to take over. And in terms of driver assistance I think that hands on the wheel is actually a good way to keep drivers engaged, plus it's not really an inconvenience because you shouldn't be doing anything with your hands that would prevent you from taking over. So whether I'm resting my hand on the steering wheel or the arm rest doesn't matter that much, either way I'm still \"driving\" and the car is doing things like keeping me in the lane.\n\nPeople say that Tesla is leading in advanced driver assistance because autopilot is extremely good, you can use it on a lot of roads (almost anything that has marked lanes), it's very reliable (potentially too reliable, without being perfect), and the safety features that are part of it are very good too.\n\nIn terms of fully autonomous, I think that Waymo has to be the leader, they're the only ones right now that offering fully driverless rides at any meaningful scale, to the public. The question is if they have the tech and resources to scale that service up to a much larger audience and to more difficult areas?\n\nBut if we're judging companies by who's the first to offer level 5 autonomous at scale (or something that would technically count as it), then there's an argument that Tesla is the leader.

{"title": "Fisker ($FSR) and Canoo ($GOEV), Their Discrepancy in Value, and Suspicious Canoo Price Action", "selftext": "\\*This DD serves as mainly a bull case for Canoo and is not intended to be a bear case for Fisker.\n\n**Introduction:**\n\nFisker and Canoo are both EV companies that completed mergers with special purpose acquisition companies to go public and immediately gain access to capital. This was the route of choice for many other EV companies as well, since the automotive business is naturally capital intensive and this was the quickest avenue for them to get funding. I chose to compare Fisker with Canoo because they are both **legitimate** EV startups on similar timelines, and were compatible for comparable company analysis. \n\n**Current Valuations:**\n\nFisker has 295.24 million shares outstanding, and with a closing stock price of $19.30 is valued at **$5.7 billion**.\n\nCanoo has 237.5 million shares outstanding, and with a closing stock price of $9.67 is valued at **$2.3 billion**.\n\n**Models:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Canoo's Lifestyle Vehicle](https://preview.redd.it/bbz3ywca6u771.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d77153f52d1d954f8c3660306e92a21ada8999f)\n&#x200B;\n\n[Fisker's Ocean SUV](https://preview.redd.it/piv2ehs05u771.png?width=1260&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e23371f0deedde93db66e98cf08c94a364f2efb)\n\n\nThese are the two models Fisker and Canoo chose to begin production with. Clearly Fisker's Ocean SUV looks like something we are used to while Canoo's Lifestyle Vehicle is a modern/reinvented minivan. The most used bear case against Canoo is the bold design of the minivan. However, what is overlooked is that the fully electric minvan market is **100% untapped** and Canoo is the only EV maker with plans to release one. Fisker's SUV is nice, but the electric SUV market is going to be one of the most competitive in the industry, with Tesla already having the Model X and Model Y, GM releasing it's electric Bolt SUV, and Ford releasing the Mach-E SUV. Canoo will have **no direct competitors** with their Lifestyle Vehicle. While it has a bold design, it's extra interior space will make it desirable regardless of it's look (who wouldn't want to take a Lyft/Uber in that?).\n\nThe ocean starts at $37,499 while the lifestyle vehicle starts at $34,750. Canoo has 3 trims other than the base model: Delivery, Premium, and Adventure ([seen here](https://www.canoo.com/canoo/)) that will run more than that. Fisker likely will too but hasn't released any.\n\nCanoo already has released two other models (a Pickup truck and Delivery Vehicle) that they plan on producing in 2023. It's clear they are targeting the areas that have been untapped by EV's, practically guaranteeing themselves adequate demand.\n\nFisker has not released it's future models.\n\n**Production:**\n\nBoth companies plan to have production begin in Q4 of 2022, both doing so with the help of outside contract manufacturers. Fisker has a contract with [Magna](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1720990/000119312521192732/d175606dex101.htm) for it's Ocean model and one with [Foxconn](https://www.wsj.com/articles/foxconn-to-build-cars-for-electric-vehicle-startup-fisker-11614169530) for a future unknown model. Canoo has a contract with [VDL Nedcar](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1750153/000155837021008512/goev-20210616xex10d1.htm) for the production of it's first model, the Lifestyle vehicle, expecting to produce 1,000 units in 2022 and 15,000 in 2023. Fisker's long term plan is to stick with outsourcing it's production while Canoo has recently announced a contract to build it's own manufacturing facility in [Oklahoma](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1750153/000155837021008512/goev-20210616xex99d2.htm).\n\nCanoo has been making vehicles for testing for months, and has over 500,000 test miles. [see here](https://twitter.com/canoo/status/1405551289321263108)\n\n[Picture of Test Vehicle Taken in Buckeye, AZ](https://preview.redd.it/7l32db087u771.png?width=3000&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1f7c929038678a3d7326266afcda07952d26443)\n\n**Financials:**\n\nCanoo had $642 million cash on hand on March 31st based on there last 10K.\n\nFisker had $985 million cash on hand on March 31st based on there last 10K.\n\nCanoo recently stated they have enough cash on hand to last them through their first production phase (Q4 of 2022). We can assume Fisker does as well, but they have not given a specific estimate.\n\n**Bearish Cases:**\n\nThe biggest bear cases for Canoo earlier this year was their pivoting away from the subscription model/engineering services and the departure of their former CEO Ulrich Kranz. However, both go hand in hand and make perfect sense. In order to have their subscription model work, they would have to pay the cost of all the vehicles they planned on using upfront before generating any revenue. Their CAPEX is already going to be high enough and this plan made 0 sense. Helping other companies engineer their own electric vehicles also seemed counterintuitive. That would be like Burger King helping McDonalds create a new, healthier burger. These ideas were made by Ulrich Kranz, a famous engineer (clearly not a businessman). The board of directors realized this, and Ulrich decided to mutually part ways. It was not a hostile event and he still is holding over 1 million shares in the company.\n\nFisker's biggest bear case is probably it's CEO's, Henrik Fisker, previous failed attempt at starting an automotive business. His first company was also named Fisker and went upside down after a first product launch riddled with problems and a failed attempt to retool a factory(which is why he is probably sticking with the contract manufacturer route).\n\nBoth are often called pre-revenue duds/bubble stocks. However, EV is the biggest business opportunity in the automotive industry since 1903 when the first Ford was made. With an estimated $2 trillion dollar automotive market up for grabs with gas prices soaring and green energy trending, I believe high EV valuations are warranted.\n\n**Back to Valuation:**\n\nAfter all this, why is Fisker currently worth 2.5 times more than Canoo? This type of discrepancy is not warranted.  You can argue it's hard to value pre-revenue companies(it is), but by that large of a margin? When they both have accomplished the same milestones and are on the same production timeline? I think it's more fishy than that. Canoo has had 2 months full of positive news and is still trading down, pinned under it's original NAV price of $10. Whenever it has broken it (2 times the past 3 weeks) it has quickly and sharply retreated back under 10.\n\n**Potential Explanation:**\n\nAfter March (when the news of the CEO departure and business model changed were released), GOEV shares were heavily shorted. Ever since then it seems the price has been actively manipulated.\n\nHere is a chart with the share price of GOEV (blue) and GME (orange) the past 6 months.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0lwvqv6l9u771.png?width=1916&format=png&auto=webp&s=79be0b0a77caf2a00ad6c7659be5627b837cae85\n\nAs you can see, **before March** GME and GOEV movement were completely unrelated. But **after March**, they became very similar. Canoo could have gained hedge fund interest similar to that of GME. Otherwise it should easily be trading much closer to Fisker's valuation. Short interest has steadily risen and is now **almost 40%** (see my last [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o7pl8h/goev_the_best_way_to_play_russel_reconstitution/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) for exact data).\n\n**Conclusion/ TLDR**\n\nCanoo and Fisker are the most promising companies out of the EV startups. However, they are trading at valuations nowhere near each other. Canoo is severely undervalued in comparison to Fisker. Could be the result of short manipulation. Due to Russell 3000 Inclusion, volume should be up this week and things could get interesting.\n\n**Positions:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mzb63hq0au771.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ce5a1861076e565ae7957e5c557b5be66a4552b\n\n**Disclosure:**\n\nThis is not financial advice.

Fisker is severly overvalued, and has strung investors along for a year with nothing to show.\n\nWhy did he and his wife just sell $20m worth of stock?\n\nWhat IP does Fisker have that makes it worth $6b?\n\nWhere is Fisker's solid state batteries that he showed off in CES 2018, but never materialized in anything? He promised 700-mile range, with charging in one-minute.\n\nWhy does an automotive company not have any engineering staff?\n\nWhy did Fisker give up 6% of their company to Magna, when Magna has never asked this of any of their clients in the past?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I treat fisker like I treat AMD.  As you may or may not know, AMD doesn't build their own wafers. They sold glofo about a decade ago. AMD is just a design and r&d. Like IBM became a decade earlier. \n\nClearly we can't treat Evs like legacy auto market. \n\nWhat you get from fisker is in ideal situation you get to the market in mass asap. It's a stop gap investment that is less speculative. As previously stated it's a discount Tesla/nio in the eyes of investors today. The price of either already has the future locked in. Neither really shouldn't go up in value. Only real factor atm is Biden bucks and inflation increasing the dollar price but not the value.\n\n\nMy thesis is this the poor man late arrival choice. So to me it's not about saying this is better than Tesla /NIO but has potential being a 3rd way. From all the other options I do believe fisker has the best ability. That isn't something I'd hold for a decade though. This will go up in smoke more than likely within 3-4 years. Which might be reincarnated with magna merger. \n\nTheengineering and solid state are the best bear thesis I've heard. Engineering wise I'd need to confirm. Solid state, hard to say without the engineering situation understood. Because if the engineering statement is true than what did they show and how were they going to develop a battery in the first place? This would be a bear question to expand upon.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "In the interest of providing thoughtful consideration points, I think it is worth mentioning that VW is working on their electric minivan bus that will (IMHO) compete with Canoo's lifestyle vehicle.
