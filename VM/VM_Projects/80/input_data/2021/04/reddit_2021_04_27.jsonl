Just in February '21 Microsoft released its industrial edition model of the lens so it's still in active development. These guys currently use camera sensors for the HoloLens based on the Kinect, but as they want to lead in industrial augmented reality applications, there are still advantages to lidar systems that they do not use. As an example, the current 3D-object resolution is not high enough to detect my Micro-penis (coincidence?), therefore it is missing out on potential applications in the pornographic industry.
