{"title": "The Zone of Greed - One of the Most Common Mistakes", "selftext": "**Not Waiting For Confirmation**   \n\n\nI get it.  You want to be *ahead of the move.*  If you wait you will have already missed your chance.  \n\nThis isn't logic - it is greed (and yes Gordon Gekko, Greed is Good, we all know. We've all seen it).\n\nIn this case it is a very well-defined **Zone of Greed**.  This is the specific part of a move that you’re afraid of missing out on if you wait.\n\nThe most common way this happens is with **The Gut Call** \\- otherwise known as *picking tops and bottoms*.  It can’t go up/down forever right?  So instead of identifying where key technical levels of support/resistance are and then waiting for those to be violated, you jump early.  Who wants to wait until SPY breaks 414.75 before they short it?? That’s 2 1/2 points you’re giving up!  (if you are Day Trading a simple trendline would suffice).  \n\nAbout half of the trades I hear people suggest are based on nothing more than a \"due for a reversal\" mentality.  Remember:\n\n**Successful traders don’t predict the market, they act when the market confirms a direction.**  \n\nNotice I said \"Traders\", not \"Investors\".  Investors try to predict long-term, but short-term retail traders are jumping on a bandwagon and going for the ride.  \n\nThe moment you realize that, is the moment you start becoming consistent in your trading.  With some notable exceptions (GME), retail traders **do not** move the market, institutions do, and when they do they leave bread crumbs for us to follow.  We can see the results of those plays in the price action and if we are patient enough, when those results are confirmed, we can cash in on them. \n\nHumbling, I know.  \n\nConsider this - you are an hour into trading and see that TSLA is down $6 on the day.  In your experience when TSLA starts the day down, it tends to finish even farther down.  So you short it.  You didn't look to see if TSLA violated any support levels or what the volume is for that day, you just don't want to miss any more of the downward move.  However, perhaps SPY is down $3 on the day so far, a fairly significantly drop and compared to SPY TSLA is actually doing quite well.  TSLA has Relative Strength against the market.  With the market down $3 TSLA should be down much more than just $6.  Thus, the moment SPY rebounds, TSLA takes off and winds up finishing up $9 while your Puts get destroyed.  \n\nIf you just asked yourself one question - \"Do I have technical confirmation?\" before making a trade, and moved ahead ***only*** if the answer is \"Yes\" - your trading results would improve dramatically.  Does this mean you give up a certain portion of a move up or down? Yes.  But you also give up being wrong so often that it isn't nearly made up for by the times you are right.\n\nThat small range that you are giving up is not worth the chance you are taking.  For SPY right now that would be a zone of roughly $2.50.  Between the current price (417.20) and the support level (414.75).  That is the additional profit you would generate if you shorted SPY before a technical breakdown.\n\nIt is for this same reason you shouldn't hold a position over earnings.  Once again you are afraid of missing a huge move in the stock.  But as we have all seen, earnings is a crap shoot - a stock could crush earnings and drop 10% the next day.  Wait until you see the response and then play the response.  Even worse are people who buy calls or puts right before earnings and then watch as their options get crushed by a deflating IV.\n\nYour goal should be consistent wins every day.  You can only reach that goal when you stop chasing huge moves.  Ironically you are more likely to see profits when you give up the greed.", "id": "mtierw", "created_utc": 1618770470.0, "score": 208, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 80, "comments": [{"body": "OP should be listened to here—this is critical information.

For instance, what makes the “support/resistance” of SPY 414.75 right now? Not just “if I draw lines on this chart it looks like 414.75,” what factors (moving average, relative strength, news/market events, historic pricing) actually determine this value, and how can you *reliably* calculate a) this value, and b) what to do when the stock price hits it?\n\nSpecifically, how useful is this value? If SPY drops below 414.75 by 10am Monday, does that mean there’s a certain (calculable, or at least able to be estimated) % chance it will fall to some other value within a given amount of time?\n\nI understand that buying a put “because I feel like it” is not really a sound strategy, and considering factors will improve your odds of success greatly. But every time I hear about a symbol about to “break its support level” or whatever I never hear an accompanying “this math, along with what’s been going on in the world affecting this ticker, shows why this is the support level” as well as “so the price is likely to drop an additional *x*% by *y* time, because of *math*”; instead, I see “I’ve drawn these lines which make it look like the support level is slightly below the current price” and “if this support level is tested the stock might rise or stay at the support level, but if it’s broken it will fall in price or trade below the support level”. Aka “as the stock moves around this price, it will either go up or down, or stay the same, but I think it’s going to go down”. Which in the end, isn’t much better than just buying a put when you’re calling the top.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "I'm just an amateur, but isn't support/resistance more a behavioral thing rather than math? \n\nMy understanding was, if a price action hits a certain peak and pulls back, people will tend to place limit orders near that peak. For example if they bought on the way down and are bag-holding, they might want to sell when it hits that price again. Or if they wanted to buy and missed a dip, they might set a limit order to buy next time.\n\nThen if there's continuous buy pressure on a price for example, it might run into a whole batch of these limit sell orders and fail to move the price further. If the momentum is good enough to fill all those orders then it might get past them and suddenly speed up, hence a break out. On top of that, because people are aware of this, others will try to exploit it by setting their own order around the same levels. So these support/resistance levels get reinforced because people know they exist, as some kind of emergent behavior.\n\nMaybe a kind of game-theoretic equilibrium is the right way to  look at it.

Before we go down another stupid rabbit hole about the parameters of actively monitoring, you know the difference.\n\nAs for taking a step back, the question is: at what point do manufacturers bear liability? There’s a moral, ethical answer and then there’s the level that can be adjudicated by law. Both of them are fundamentally built around the same general philosophy which is - “you’ve released x,y,z product - what does a potential user need to know in order to operate it without causing harm to themselves\nor those around them. Does the user need special training in order to use? If so, what body regulates that certification? Upon certification, the user has demonstrated the mental competence and understanding of the dangers of Said product and has proven to an acceptable level that they understand the dangers that potentially can happen with misuse. Thereby, releasing the manufacturer of liability unless mechanical or technical error that no regular user would realistically be able to identify or avoid. Some products which have age requirements are not expected to have the same level of specific education regarding the dangers of their product. The age requirement implies that the user of said product, once of the required age, has enough general understanding about the risks and harms associated with whatever product etc” \n\nThat’s just a general summary of my own interpretation but should basically sum up the issue at hand. There’s a reason why people have to be a certain age to use certain products. People of the required age, are expected to have the mental competence to use a product safely. They receive training and constant spot checks to assure they’ve maintained the level of competence needed to operate: driving education, permit, licensing, recertification, outside enforcement etc.\n\nAnyone buying a Tesla and operating one is expected to have the cognitive ability to read and comprehend the safety warnings. Additionally,\nI believe ther even in the “autonomous driver” mode, it states on the screen and dash that driver must remain at the controls and that the system was designed to assist, and is not fully autonomous. \nUser error does make these fundamental things irrelevant. Implying a users blatant disregard for the numerous warning signs and active notices telling them the act is not safe to leave alone and their attention is required is in any way analogous to someone just being handed a potentially lethal narcotic...not even close to an accurate example.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "You realize when heroin first came out it was a legal otc product and it was later legislated as a schedule 1 due to people abusing it?
