Annotate images and videos with this tool to turn your data into high quality data for training. \n* **Object detection API:** Tesla's proprietary models can classify your images and videos and assign labels/categories. \n* **Deployment:** Leverage Tesla's OTA capabilities to automate NN deployment across devices at the edge. \n\nDojo Supercomputer will be at the core of all these services.", "score": 17, "replies": [{"body": "Pretty sure they will speak about the AI used in the Energy business as well", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "The machine learning for energy products is much more simpler and tractable.

It will definitely not require Dojo :) \n\nFor vision related problems, you need to process petabytes of unstructured data.

Along with the IAAS (powered by Dojo), Tesla can also provide the necessary services needed for large-scale AI training, optimization and deployment.

Tesla can potentially sell some of the tools and API subscriptions which can add tremendous value to other researchers and businesses. That would provide incremental SaaS revenue.\n\nWith all that, Tesla will be directly competing with Amazon, Microsoft, Google and IBM who are also building pieces of AI-As-A-Service ecosystems.
