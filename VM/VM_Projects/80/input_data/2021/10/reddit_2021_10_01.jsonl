{"title": "How Zillow, Redfin and Opendoor manipulate the single family residential/house market", "selftext": "TLDR: They are damn smart, will cause house prices to rise, but I'm not Michael Burry autismo yet to bet against any of them.\n\nTLDR2: They buy a few key houses, artificially inflate the price, borrow against that asset, use that collateral as more cash, and buy more houses in strategic areas. It's like fractional reserve banking but with houses.\n\nI trade mortgage backed securities. Actually nah, I'm just a real estate agent and I'm salty. Actually I am a teller at a money center bank and I say I'm an investment banker on Tinder. But actually I just give BJs behind your local Wendy's. You can trust me.\n\nZillow, Redfin and Opendoor has been involved in buying single family homes for the past 2 years now. Buying a house for 200k and then flipping for 250k, believe it or not, is not the main way their single family house business makes money. Of course they want prices to go up, but they do it in a much more strategic way.\n\nWhen Zillow (this is the prime example I will use going forward) wants to develop a market, they will go out and offer higher bids. You can almost preview which markets they want to get into by comparing their Zestimate with either the local tax appraisal amount (for areas where appraisals are annual like TX) or recently sold records (like CA). They will bid around 20% higher for around a portfolio of 5-10 strategic houses.\n\nAfter they buy the initial portfolio of 5-10 strategic houses, they will place maybe 1 or 2 for sale. Fixing it up is optional. These houses will be near or higher than the local average, because they are playing with data. In Austin, where hot houses near market price sell within 5 days, Zillow houses often are on the market for 2-4 weeks. They don't need to sell it, and often don't want to because they are creating a data point.\n\nSo what happens with that 50% marked up house? A withdrawn listing is not good for both the house in the future (people may wonder if there are structural or physical problems) and not good for the area (no bids). They simply buy it back using one of their smaller funded vehicles. Because they have their own realtors, the transaction cost is minimal and much less than what happens next for them to make money. Great, now that previous house which cost $1 million has sold for $1.5 million. Everyone sees that because it's public record.\n\nWith that freshly minted $1.5 million record, they are able to raise the estimates of the other houses of the 5-10 initial purchases by around 50%. Do they sell those houses? Well no, because as we've seen, there are no bids at that inflated price. They take that appraisal record, and go ask for a loan from whoever wants to invest in their real estate-backed vehicle (mostly Blackrock and by extension a bunch of pension funds).\n\nSo that house they originally bought for $1 million, now has a public and documented value of $1.5 million. For Zillow, they can get around 80% LTV, so $1.5\\*80% = $1.2 million in new cash. What do they do? They take the cash to a new area, buy up new houses and the cycle continues.\n\nIs there a problem with this? I ain't no commie and I already have my own shack so I don't have any complaints. Will there be a problem? Well, what if values start to decrease? Well, apart from the 2008 blip, real estate prices in the US have always gone up. That's what everyone said until they were punched in the face. If there is going to be a decrease in demand (more rentals, or as old people start dying off and leaving houses to their kids) or supply or everyone deciding to move out of the shithole that is San Francisco and Los Angeles, you'd expect houses to go down. If the house price decreases to maybe around 50% LTV, there may be margin calls.\n\nSo essentially, it might be a repeat of 2008. This time, Fannie/Freddie/Ginnie have been replaced by Blackrock and a bunch of private funds (post 2008, a large part of the foreclosed houses were owned by Fannie/Freddie and sold off one by one). The average American borrower has been replaced by Zillow/Redfin/Opendoor. The only difference this time is that the numbers are bigger, and Zillow/Redfin/Opendoor for how has a magic money machine called local price manipulation.", "id": "pzat03", "created_utc": 1633103429.0, "score": 138, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 79, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|255|**First Seen In WSB**|3 years ago\n**Total Comments**|233|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f94hy6/the_case_for_ccl_puts/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fi7g5p/did_your_calls_and_puts_decay_today_the_case_for/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fvj571/zoom_communications_and_the_chinese_government/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fwl0kt/5000_on_essentially_a_zm_yolo_70p_821/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mavkie/treasury_issuance_calendar_for_the_next_week_and/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f5epon/csco_dd/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f8t24f/my_last_play_ccl_puts/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwln2x/vale_iron_ore_infrastructure_inflation_and_brazil/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n8urkv/corn_gang_good_weather_is_coming_farmers_are/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dyu02b/deck_decker_outdoors_is_the_holy_grail_in_becky/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4nyn3/dissecting_why_gme_went_up_so_bigly_and_is_the/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n48yea/corn_ethanol_demand_lack_of_supply_odd_weather/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4sb4t/dissecting_why_gme_went_up_so_bigly_and_is_the/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lwlrvj/dis_the_ultimate_postpandemic_play/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fd9lss/the_end_of_globalization_and_rise_of_teleworking/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fdnlp8/the_case_for_selling_puts_msft_150p_june/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mrj8si/cattle_futures_buy_the_dip/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mid1ih/nfps_tomorrow_and_the_treasuries_market_tlt_govt/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lchkzz/ford_its_a_data_company_now/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pzat03/how_zillow_redfin_and_opendoor_manipulate_the/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m5p2r2/disney_the_all_in_one_stop_recovery_stock/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/csk2vz/buy_spyqqq_sell_ea/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lig3lx/bmbl_i_hate_the_stock/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e4xvg5/costco_china_dd/) \n**Account Age**|4 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=pzat03)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=pzat03)\n    \nHey /u/1poundbookingfee, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I just have 1 FD for QQQ 359 that I'm 50% down on. \n\nhttps://imgur.com/NZVkMnc", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I'm in real estate but also give BJ's behind the Wendy's too.

This post is only for the majority of people who believe inflation is real. If you think inflation is transitory, go buy bonds or something. I'm only interested in helping people who believe inflation is real understand how to properly bet on it\n\nIf you believe inflation is real and are willing to bet on it. You can easily make 200-400% return in 2 years if you're right. And if you're wrong, you shouldn't see anything worse than 20% losses\n\n**Here's how to do it, and why it's guaranteed.**\n\nHRC prices, or in laymans terms, steel, is currently trading at $1930 a ton. Over 3x higher than it was a year ago. Steel companies have seen very little movement despite this.\n\nCleveland cliffs currently has a forward P/E of only 3.98. A very low forward P/E. It is only this low, because of the belief that inflation is transitory, so there is no need to invest, even if CLF is currently making money hand over fist.\n\nIf inflation isn't transitory, the market will eventually have to push CLF up to a fair value for the current prices it is selling steel at. Which puts it at $40 at the bear case (inflation isn't transitory but won't go any higher) and $80+ at the bull case (inflation isn't transitory and will continue to go up)\n\nI personally believe inflation won't stop until interest rates are raised significantly. Which the vast majority of Americans agree with (not surprising since it's basic economics), so I see CLF hitting the higher end of the range\n\n**\"But what if the market never agrees and permanently thinks inflation is transitory\"**\n\nFor one, I don't think this will be the case, I think the longer prices remain elevated, and better and better earnings get, the market will catch on. But even if this was the case. CLF and other steel producers are making such an insane amount of money compared to their stock price, they could, and will, use the profits to buy the stock themselves.
