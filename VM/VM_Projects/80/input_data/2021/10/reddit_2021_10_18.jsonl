This is a straw man to prop up your ideological position. This is not a binary dichotomy between \"monetary policy is irrelevant\" and \"monetary policy is all that matters.\" If you think I'm saying it's irrelevant or that the inflation isn't a complicating factor, then you don't know enough about economics to understand my point or have any opinion at all.\n\nI'm not and have never said it was irrelevant. What I have said is that the data tells us pretty clearly that it's not the money in the system causing the demand nor the supply issues on its own... that it's not the dominant factor. Thus far, aside from making an ideological argument based in a fundamental misunderstanding of macroeconomics that would result in the failure of a high school econ class, you haven't provided a single scrap of actual information to prove your point... because you don't have any.\n\nYou, like the others, have not actually talked about the correlative factors in the macro data... just ignored it.\n\nAnd \\*I\\* am not one of the people who predicted 2% inflation and that it would only last a short period of time. Someone would have to be insane to predict that a growth dynamic like coming out of a pandemic wouldn't be inflationary. That would also be an insanely ignorant position to take. Don't throw me in that bucket because that's never been my position.\n\nMy position is pretty straightforward: The inflation is affecting specific sectors beyond the baseline, and those sectors are affected by supply chain disruption and increased demand as the market shifts away from the 2020 pandemic-style economy. That's gonna cause inflation. MoM, that inflation is slowly abating. YoY, it still looks large even though it's slowly declining. That will take around a year from now to settle out, I think. But 5.3% CPI is \\*not\\* a massive, dangerous inflation rate. It's barely above the pre-2010 baseline and during many boom periods we experienced that rate of inflation without issue, and that was without QE and significant lower wage income expansion like we're seeing now. This is only a crisis to people who do not understand economics and have never studied economic history who just see relative numbers over the span of short time periods and freak out.\n\nAnd on that note, if massive capital expansion like we saw this year was the primary factor for inflation, then why did the QE post-2008 crash result in the most suppressed period of inflation in American history?\n\nBased on how you think the world works, and how you've misinterpreted the position of \"mainstream economists\" the 2010s should have been in inflationary hellscape... but they weren't, because it's really not as simple as you think it is.", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "This is one of the best arguments I have seen on WSB in a very, very long time.", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "I think you bring up some really good points here about the data not supporting the hypothesis that the fed's money printing is the primary driver of inflation.

But you appear to know way more about this then I do so correct me where I'm wrong\n\nI'm aware of this theory and here's why it's wrong:\n\nPeople in making this argument are conflating QE with stimulus and recovery, and they're not the same thing and they don't have the same effects, and in 2008 both QE and stimulus were put into the economy just as happened in the past year. What people are doing in making this argument is that they're selecting things that reinforce their position while rejecting any data that conflicts.\n\nThe Fed doesn't put money into people's accounts. There's no mechanism to do that. They can only put it into the banks. The Treasury prints money and then puts that money into the reserve system, then the Fed acts as a lever to determine how much capital is in the market at any given time and they do so by supplying banks. Once the banks have the capital, often through bond sales back to the Fed, they then use their own standards (leveraged against FDIC capitalization requirements) to determine how much capital they need in any given time to ensure stability in lending. In both 2008 and now the primary purpose of the QE was to maintain banking liquidity against toxic assets, since in both 2008 and now mortgages, etc, were under threat of default... meaning that just like having more capital to cover margin in an investment account when you have high risk leverage, the banks need to do the same thing and anchor against risk with capital.\n\nWhenever they do QE, the FDIC also increases capitalization requirements and will increase them to a greater extent on banks with higher risk. With the rest of the money, banks will use their risk management system to determine whether or not the rest of the capital sits as a cash anchor, goes to proprietary investment, or goes towards anchoring and financing lending. That last part is how the banks actually release that capital into the market, but it lags and increases with risk reduction... and while the credit market has loosened, it hasn't loosened quite as much as people think. A lot of that lending in this cycle went towards anchoring payroll loans, which are how most companies do pay. If bank liquidity dries up, you get payrolls bouncing and then that can accelerate into a deeper liquidity crisis.\n\nWhile the stimulus and recovery in this case was a bit higher than it was in 2008, what people are missing is that it largely replaced capital that was already in the market and wasn't the product of anyone \"printing\" money. These are financed through spending which is either paid for with tax receipts, loans, or bond purchases. People look at the PPP loans and the total cost of unemployment costs, etc, and think \"oooh, those are big numbers\" but they're not that big compared to actual spending in the economy, and they couldn't fill the consumer spending gap. What these effectively did was decrease the deflationary impact on the economy last year from the loss of wages, and people are imagining that without that inflation would have been higher, but inflation is a Year over Year figure so if we had a full collapse and then a rocket recovery right now, what would really have happened is that inflation would have been higher. \n\nEssentially, people don't understand how these rubber band effects occur and don't really understand how inflation is calculated, nor do they understand the spending patterns.\n\nAs far as the predictions are concerned... predictions by themselves don't mean anything without hard data to back them up. I could say that the stars form a giant wolf in the sky and that that's why the moon shows up at night, and tomorrow the moon will appear... does that mean that the wolf pushed it? \n\nObviously not, and in this case what we have to do is hit the hard data. If cash was competing for goods and that was the cause, then you wouldn't have significant sector inflation, you'd have increase across the board since the pressure from capital expansion affects ALL parts of the market. It also is a function of magnitudes, so if the QE reliably created inflation and other factors weren't in play, then the 2008 example would have resulted in something above the 3-4% baseline... like maybe 4% relative to 5.3% now based on that assumption... but it's not the only factor and crashes create their own dynamics, as well as other factors in the market. \n\nIn this case, the simple reality is that the argument is that consumer spending is driving the inflation and it's not really a supply issue. This is obviously a false argument because we know that supply chain issues exist and are inflationary, and it's the sectors that are with those chain issues that are experiencing the most inflation, and consumer spending figures don't support that hypothesis... so all predictions aside, the hard data tells a different story. \n\nThe wolf is not, actually, pushing the moon.", "score": 5, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "The \"data\" is cooked", "score": -14, "replies": [{"body": "Ahh, yes... clearly the company I work for cooked our economic prediction data so that we could create false predictions because that somehow helps us.

You're correct that the spending doesn't have to be parabolic for inflation to occur, but that's because spending (I.e. money supply) isn't the only factor in inflationary trends.\n\nWe keep coming back to this weird fucking binary argument of whether monetary infusion causes inflation or not, when that's not the question. The question is whether monetary release is \\*responsible\\* for the current inflation, which the argument we're retorting is that it is.\n\nM2 release was basically parabolic, so if that's the cause, then spending has to be parabolic. OK, but that's muted by the banks, right? Well, yes, but it's still released as a function of increased capital. For your argument to work, the growth rate of spending has to not just be subjectively higher than you think it should be... it has to be higher than the normal curve of spending growth over time to generate excess inflation. I.e. parabolic increase.\n\n3% growth from 2019 baseline to now is not crazy. Like you said, GDP generally grows 2-3% and so that's expected. I don't know where you got the idea that 3% after a recession would be weird, but I'm looking directly at a graph of consumer spending over the past 80 years right now and... we're entirely in-line with what happens, even after recessions.\n\nAnd this isn't a normal recession, this is a recession with a global pandemic which we haven't seen in about 100 years. We don't have good economic data for the last one, but what we do know about the Spanish Flu was that there was a boom immediately after it that is also often correlated with the end of WWI. Disambiguating these effects is complicated and almost impossible, but to suggest that we shouldn't rubber band back after a pandemic starts to end is to suggest that this is like a housing or S&L crisis where capital is completely disrupted. We chose not to do that, and that was a good thing. If we did what you're suggesting what would have happened was that last year would have seen massive homelessness, financial collapse, destitution, etc... the \"natural\" course of events: When you starve the host, it dies and rots.\n\nOf course, the world collectively chose not to do that because... it's fucking dumb. Yeah, it would have generated a deflationary event in 2020, but that would have been because of essentially market annihilation. Thanks, I'll take the inflation... that's a much easier problem to handle.\n\nBut back to the consumer spending graph, not only does your claim about 3% growth after a recession being weird NOT pan out, but the opposite emerges... in other historical recessions the impact on spending is actually muted compared to the pandemic, because while other recessions created systemic problems, they largely didn't completely halt consumer activity. In 2020 we lost a \\*LOT\\* more than 3% of spending. Further, GDP growth this year thus far is averaging close to 6%, and that's not counting the massive rubber band of GDP expansion in the last quarter of 2020...\n\nAdd all of this up and it tells the opposite of the story that you're trying to tell: Consumer spending, even with record high demand, is pretty restrained and nowhere near what you would need to justify the current inflation.", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Largely debunked...lol.

The wealth effect is a real thing, people spend lots of money when their savings are getting blown through the roof thanks to the money printer. I know others who are watching their accounts go to the moon as well and are spending money they normally wouldnt spend.\n\nLet stocks fall 20% and watch demand fall into the earths core as people quit spending. I personally won't be spending a penny if we enter a bear market.\n\nMy argument is basically this: you hand out free money like crazy, people will spend that money, pushing demand up, increasing inflation.\n\nIf powell keeps pumping, I might even throw $5k into buying a new PC for the hell of it next year, because why not? We have a chip shortage too so thats 1 more extra person spending on electronics that normally wouldn't have, thanks to the current monetary policy.", "score": -9, "replies": [{"body": "My argument is this: We're talking about inflation of goods and services, not stocks.
