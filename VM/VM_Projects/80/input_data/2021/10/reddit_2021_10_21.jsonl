{"title": "Lost 85% of my portfolio, where do I go from here?", "selftext": "To begin, I found out about stocks in January of this year when a friend of mine sent a post about something called GME from WallStreetBets. I never knew anything about stocks at the time and in less than one month in the market, my portfolio was already up 100% from the GME squeeze. But little did I know this would be a huge mistake for me because my mentality entering the stock market wasn't actually trading stocks, instead, it was gambling.\n\nFast forward a couple of months later my portfolio is doing alright until I discover something called options. You can already see where this is starting to go. Even though I read so many times \"if you don't know what you're doing, avoid options\", \"don't put in what you're not willing to lose\" etc. I still dove right in. I knew absolutely nothing about them other than I can either make a ton of money, or I could lose a ton of money. I've made some insane returns on some of my calls, but I've lost a lot more. It's been a cycle of trying to win back the money I lost over and over and over again. I tell myself I will only put in what I'm willing to lose, see it go up x percent, add more, and then lose more than I was willing to lose. I also had issues with taking profits. I could be up 100% and still want to see more returns until I lost almost all of it.\n\nIt wasn't with just options either. I would FOMO things like penny stocks, panic sell at the bottom, see it rise up again, enter with a new position, use all my day trades, and then lose even more money. The problem I had was impatience. I tried holding stocks such as Apple, Microsoft, S&P 500 etc. but I wanted to see instant returns.\n\nNow, I am currently down 85% from when I first began trading, and the money I've lost could have definitely gone towards my college tuition which I am barely paying off. Luckily, my living situation is fine but it would still be nice to have that money. I know I've paid a hefty price for the \"stock market tuition\" but I am really wondering where to go from here. Should I just pull out of all my positions? Take a break? Invest long term? Take the time to learn how the market works? Or is there a deeper issue here that I am not understanding?\n\nI hope someone else can also read this post and know what not to do in the stock market.\n\nEdit: Thanks for all of the helpful advice from everyone, and some of the McDonald's/puts on my portfolio comments were pretty funny. My plan going forward will be to pull out of my portfolio for a little while and take a small break. I will begin putting money into index funds every week or so and don't plan on touching options until I really understand how they work.", "id": "qck70c", "created_utc": 1634792967.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.47, "num_comments": 85, "comments": [{"body": "yes. quit gambling....take time to learn what you're doing..stop fucking with options and penny stocks.", "score": 85, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks.
