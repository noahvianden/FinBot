In order to better understand my question let me actually give you an example.\n\nLet's say that I bought 1 stock from Amazon in 21 October 2016 for the price of 819$ and I decide to sell it now and the current price is 3435$ which means that I made a profit of 2616$. If we look at the history of Amazon the stock price tends to go up all the time. In this case what am I supposed to do? If I decide to buy an Amazon stock in let's say 3 months the price will probably be higher than 3500$ so how can I then make a profit?\n\nSo this is my question, what strategy to use in order to be able to save some money for myself and at the same time to be able to re invest? I am talking about for example few hundred of dollars worth saving and at the same time having enough money to buy other stocks.

A stepping stone is to have 2k in your account and work off marginable assets. Large downfall is you still cannot enter and exit at will being allotted only 3 “day trades” in a 5 day period. This is an ignorant rule as it drives people from investing. However, the rule was set in place to limit day traders bcs not all can just toss 25k into an account at will. Now again…all that being said IF you have that luxury making money day in and day out being able to enter and exit at will is NOT a difficult task. Look for stocks that fluctuate by season and locate certain stocks at their lowest annually…buy…hold for 2-3 weeks or until you reach a respectable 3,5,8 or 10% profit and sell. Set that as your own personal profit taking rule not getting caught up in leaving money on the table and go hunt the next low. I set my exit of 5% upon purchasing the stock and daily I see profits hit my screen on buys from days ago, weeks ago or months ago. Don’t sell early just let it ride and MAKE SURE you are selecting mid level or large cap stocks that you know will not “belly up”.  Rinse, wash, repeat. DO NOT get swept away with the fast profits like you will see DAILY. Stick with you plan and those will happen to you as well from time to time. It’s a numbers game. The more you are spread around the market it is bond to happen to you as well.  \n\nAnother great way is follow earnings reports. Stocks tend in most cases to drop 1-5 days before earnings are released then will have a rapid breakout once released (if the results are good that is). Once that breakout happens sell and move on bcs what goes up will come down to some degree. Set a trailing stop loss/ take profit and let the trade take its course. It will protect you and get you max. Profit if entered correctly. Meaning set a take profit of 1-2% below the highest price when reached following the reports release (or whatever you’re comfortable with) and set your stop less right at or slightly below the more prevalent support level and get after it.

Do you follow their earnings call (EC) every quarter? Are they in talks about developing a new product/ service?\nhttps://ir.aboutamazon.com/quarterly-results/default.aspx\n\nLet's dial back to when they were still doing e-commerce only. Were there signs that they were considering to move into providing cloud services (i.e. AWS) from their EC?\n\nI didn't dig into AMZN's EC back into the years leading up to its launch in 2006 cuz I don't think there was motley fool or seeking alpha back then, but I might be wrong.\n2006 share price: ~$30.\nAnyway, I found this 2016 article (https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/02/andy-jassys-brief-history-of-the-genesis-of-aws/amp/) where there were talks about launching AWS back in 2000s. Key here was to understand their objective and whether there was a market demand for the product. Those who did made big bucks.\n\nThere was also some news going on and about in 2013 (2013 share price ~$350) about how AWS would be their core business moving forward (https://techcrunch.com/2013/11/13/jeff-bezos-believes-aws-could-be-amazons-biggest-business/amp/). AMZN had 11x since then. Most people would start thinking: wow, is this peak performance? But no, they moved into AWS marketplace in 2012 to increase their market reach. Should've been able to find this in the ECs leading up to 2012.\n\nOther tell-tale signs could be that they are hiring aggressively (check via LinkedIn etc) - what roles are they hiring? Software engineers? What are the job descriptions? How does this match up to their growth plans as mentioned in the EC? How do they intend to use AWS as a SaaS product for its customers? How aggressive are they performing S&M from their financial statements? \n\nFast forward to the present, where AMZN's share price is roughly $3.4k, with a 2020 rev of $113b. Revenue for first 2 quarters of 2021 being $221b. What are their estimations going forward for the next 2 quarters? They've clearly made TWICE their 2020 rev within the first 6 months of 2021. Can they keep it up? What are their projections? What are they doing to reach this goal? \n\nAMZN plans to increase headcount by 150k for holiday shopping season, seems like e-commerce will most likely see a jump (https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/amazon-hire-150000-us-workers-holiday-shopping-season-2021-10-18/). FYI, they hired 100k workers for 2020 seasonal jobs. So surely this should mean something, but of course, I'd dig deeper to understand how they performed for the quarter with seasonal festivities. \n\nIn summary: follow their quarterly ECs, what are their growth plans and projections. Any new developments? Who are they hiring to front these new developments? Are these people capable and possess the relevant skill sets to execute? Did they manage to walk the talk?
