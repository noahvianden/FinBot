{"title": "GME - The Game Theory Scenario", "selftext": "Fellow Diamond Hands,\n\nFirst and foremost, I have 2,000 shares of GME which I first bought around \\~$90 as I learned about the short squeeze thesis. I know I will get a ton of hate for this, but in full transparency, I will hold these until the price dips below my reservation price of $100, at which point I will likely dump to at least get my cost basis back. I am hopeful that this won’t happen anytime soon though.\n\nI think what’s going on right now is a complicated game theory problem. I am still thinking through this so would very much appreciate any input from anyone that I may have missed.\n\n**Actors:**\n\n**The shorts**, which include the Melvins, the Citadels, and the Robinhoods. The Melvins represent all the hedge funds that are short the stock (Viking, D1, Maple Lane, etc.). The Citadels represent the market makers that have to take on a net short position to ensure liquidity and volume in the stock as the price rides up, and the Robinhoods represent the brokerages that have to post up increasing amounts of collateral to clearinghouses, as they are ultimately responsible for  losses in major downward movements in the stock (e.g., if someone buys GME at $500 on 100% margin, they in theory should be called when the stock dips to $250, but in the case of a couple trading days ago, we saw it go from $500 to $130 very quickly, making it difficult to liquidate the position on time and resulting in substantial losses for Robinhood).\n\n**The longs**, which include institutions and retailers. Institutions are all the good guy funds like Blackrock, Maverick, Vanguard, etc. that are long the stock. The retailers are us. \n\nI think we all understand the situation in that shorts are in a world of hurt. If short interest truly is 100%+, and costs of borrowing skyrocket, there really is nothing shorts can do here. They will get squeezed and we will get our tendies. If. We. Just. All. Hold.\n\nThat being said, the difficult thing here is the lack of communication and transparency that works against us. I’d bet my left nut that Citadel is on the phone with Melvin, who’s on the phone with Maple Lane, who’s on the phone with Lone Pine coordinating every move, ensuring no one triggers the short squeeze. They’ve got more weapons in their arsenal as institutions to run things like ladder attacks which we all saw these past few days. Being on the long side, however, is a little more challenging. We need to have mutual trust across not just us, as retailers, which I think we have, but also with the long funds for which there is no open line of communication. There’s a chance that they could cash out their position for a solid gain with a willing short at a set price in an OTC deal. That would not affect the stock price but would dramatically reduce the short interest and leave us holding the bag at the end of the day. This is a very real risk that we need to have in the back of our minds.\n\nThe other wrinkle to this however, is that if a true infinite squeeze were to be achieved, all the short funds would go under. Robinhood would absolutely go under. And there’s a great chance Citadel would go under as well. While that’ll bring us tremendous amounts of joy, it would not bring Blackrock the same joy as their other holdings would surely come down quite dramatically.\n\nI think the long funds have to understand this dynamic, and they’re clearly willing to play poker. They understand that there’s still squeeze to be squoze before reaching that catastrophic scenario outlined earlier, but as soon as it’s in their best interest to sell (before short funds and Citadel go under), they’ll get out. \n\n**My takeaway from all this is that there is still room to run here, which is why I’m still in, but diamond hands from all of us are needed and we need to proceed cautiously.** It’s an uphill battle to climb given our limited ability to buy stocks on certain brokerages and the shorts having an arsenal of weapons to use (including the Media), but if we have coordination amongst us, an unspoken coordination with long funds, and diamond hands, we should be able to rake in some tendies.\n\nVery open to suggestions / questions / other theories.", "id": "laecn0", "created_utc": 1612214066.0, "score": 366, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 85, "comments": [{"body": "I’m taking the opposite approach and once this all shakes out if I’m still holding a shitting position then I’ll just keep adding because Cohen is going to make GameSpot that next TSLA stock.

{"title": "$SPCE potentially an interesting sideshow 👀👀", "selftext": "First and foremost: I am long, not financial advice, so on, so forth. Also not saying sell GME so get that “only GME matters” bullshit out of here!\n\nTo the point: SPCE “pleas fly again” isn’t flying right now in the real world, but SpaceX is and they’re bringing civilians. This is bringing a lot of attention to SPCE for a number of reasons and I think it’s an excellent catalyst opportunity for the following reasons:\n\n1. This legitimizes commercial space travel to a great extent and it will bring this new category to the forefront of conversations for the coming weeks/months. To my understanding, virgin is not doing so badly in this department themselves, so it shouldn’t be challenging for them to get early adoption.\n\n2. Short interest is high as shit. Contrary to what many of you have been taught, it does NOT take 100%+ short float to cause an epic squeeze. These happen all the time when black swans fuck up bear trades. GME was just the first time a community like our successfully triggered one. With that said, SPCE sits at 50%+ short interest, and was the third most shorted stock on the market following GME and AMC. The big difference is, unlike those two names that were recovery plays, this is an emerging business and is being shorted purely on valuation despite valuation being near impossible.\n\n3. Valuing a stock like this is esoteric and I defined. This is a pre revenue company, but it’s one of the only players in a market that will be $30 billion+ by 2030 according to UBS. Let’s assume 33% market share and a 2.5x price to sales multiple (good airline average js around 1.6), then you’d get a $25 billion fair value in 2030. Given this thing will likely be growing much faster than any airline, and the fact that it’s balance sheet is fucking stacked $720+ mil cash vs around $40 mil in debt, this isn’t outrageously priced. A lot less risky than hoping GME somehow justifies a $30 Billion market cap (again, not bashing it, just rationalizing that this isn’t a crazy idea).\n\n4. Low share count = high volatility. Not than many shares on the market, around 150 mil total and in the ballpark of 70 mil in the float. This baby could move, and, unlike a mature GME or AMC, you shouldn’t count on insider bailing considering this is super early in the growth curve. This means less surprises and less risky for big at the market capital raises. (Again, not bearish on either name, long live apes!)\n\n5. People are fucking stupid. People buy the wrong ticker all the time. ZM vs ZOOM. Hell, I’m stupid, I bought the wrong ticker for Fisker, but so are other apes and I still made money! My dad even told me I need to add “SpaceX, symbols SPCE” months and months ago, and had no idea it was Virgin Galactic. I wouldn’t be shocked if half the people in the AH though this was SpaceX, hell, I wouldn’t be surprised if half of you reading this thought it was SpaceX.\n\nIn short, this seems like an excellent trade idea that’s primed for a short squeeze pop. That’s why I’m buying at least.\n\nDo your own research though, these are just my opinions, not financial advice, know your risks.", "id": "laged6", "created_utc": 1612219192.0, "score": 206, "upvote_ratio": 0.77, "num_comments": 84, "comments": [{"body": "Already in at $17🚀🚀🚀🚀 as an Aerospace engineer this one was right up my alley", "score": 71, "replies": [{"body": "My cost average is $17 too!", "score": 21, "replies": []}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "[OG, this is the way back home](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbetsOGs/comments/l7hjr7/welcome_to_wallstreetbetsogs/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "[reunited and it feels so good](https://image.spreadshirtmedia.net/image-server/v1/compositions/T812A1PA3811PT17X49Y47D167531197FS2951/views/1,width=650,height=650,appearanceId=1/haha-yes-order-executed.jpg)", "score": 6, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "50 shares at 8.99, almost feels like free money at this point", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Been holding and adding since last January.
