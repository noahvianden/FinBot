The company's first product - TRUFORMA - is an innovative diagnostic tool that is scheduled for commercial launch on March 31, 2021. $ZOM has garnered a decent amount of attention lately, and I get a lot of people asking me about it. There is not much TA I can perform on this one as it is up to much to make sense of anything. If it pulls back to more interesting buying levels, I might take a positions in it. Alternatively, I'd suggest dollar cost averaging into this starting at $2 and down to $1.5 as there are two gaps to be filled. I wouldn't force this one, although high risk is high reward. \n\n* Target Price: $4\n* Entry: <$2\n* Risk: 4\n* Timeframe: 1-2 months\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/am0ru1j77yg61.png?width=1018&format=png&auto=webp&s=144bcf9018e9ffaaa3cb77a4b9951bf2b4f53056\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Notable Mentions:**\n\n**$LAC:** Lithium Americas Corp is a lithium mining company that has a mine in NW Nevada. Considering there is most likely going to be a shortage of batteries since the Administration has barred South Korean giant SK Innovation from importing batteries. This might be lifted, however there is no reason to assume that domestic production of batteries will slow down. Biden has made a push to EVs a cornerstone of his term so far. I had put this on my watchlist a couple weeks ago, but today I picked up some calls. \n\n* Target Price: $30\n* Entry: <$21\n* Risk: 3\n* Timeframe: 2-4 months\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0js4ugm97yg61.png?width=1018&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6de02ca7e499966862d7b8720c21ca91cd982bf\n\n \n\n$**SOLO**: This Canadian EV maker is down to $8. I like selling covered calls with this one. \n\n$**THCX**: This Cannabis ETF is down 20% today, and could provide a good opportunity to start dollar cost averaging into a position. \n\n$**DKNG**: Draftkings is in my buy zone currently.
