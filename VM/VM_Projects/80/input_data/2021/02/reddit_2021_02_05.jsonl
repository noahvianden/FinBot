I should have done this earlier, but its never to late. Recently, with sports betting being legalized this industry is set to grow exponential and DKNG has a firm grasp on majority market share. Actually, I put in an order for a call option today 6 months out, deep ITM to get that high Delta. It didn't get filled, so I will be trying again. Dollar cost down if necessary, even with calls. No brainer, should turn us very nice gains. I'll be looking at LEAPS tomorrow.\n\n* Target Price: $100\n* Entry: <$63\n* Risk: 3\n* Timeframe: 6-10 months\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xj1q9tywikf61.png?width=1018&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb0a8232153252d77320e6828ed7366cd612d7d8\n\n \n\n**$PYPL:** My analysis on Paypal is going to be similar to $DKNG. This is another company in an industry that has benefited from the Coronavirus. Online and app payment is already here and will continue to grow. I believe it will be very ingrained in American culture in the next 5 years, similar to what AliPay has done and is in China. I'm going to be picking up some LEAPS and averaging down if necessary. \n\n* Target Price: $350\n* Entry: <$275\n* Risk: 3\n* Timeframe: 6-10 months\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tv5y7i3yikf61.png?width=1018&format=png&auto=webp&s=f9ccd14ce6a971d3c375a0e7805dc45a3ad0a613\n\n \n\n**LMND:** So, I finally tried it out and I have to say that I loved it and I'm going to be a long time customer. Lemonade INC is an insurance company that is very popular with millennials. It has an VERY easy to use app and I got coverage for one of my rental properties in literally 5 minutes. Highly recommended! I will be keeping an eye on this one and anything else like it that pops up. I set two different buy zones. The lower one would be a better deal for us, and safer to get in - support on the supertrend. The upper buy zone incase it bounces up off the bullish trend. Just my take. What do you guys think about my TA?\n\n* Target Price: $190\n* Entry: <$160\n* Risk: 4\n* Timeframe: 2-4 months\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fl0tqi3zikf61.png?width=1018&format=png&auto=webp&s=680bd6d437de735c9f316f5dfae92371c2166e85\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n \n\nNote: Risk (1 out of 5) is my opinion of how risky the stock and these plays are; 1 being the lowest and 5 is the highest. \n\nDisclaimer: The comments opinions and analysis expressed herein are for informational and educational purpose only and should not be considered as individual advice or recommendations.", "id": "lcwx2u", "created_utc": 1612491326.0, "score": 157, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 83, "comments": [{"body": "Thanks for HOL yesterday.
