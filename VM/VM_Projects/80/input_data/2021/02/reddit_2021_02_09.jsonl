{"title": "Blackberry (BB) secured another catalyst for growth with Motional.", "selftext": "Sorry if you‚Äôre tired of seeing BB on your feed, but this is definitely worth reading.\n\nAs u/Fairytalezz mentioned: Today 2/9/2021 BB announced its [QNX Black channel Communications Technology](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/software-solutions/embedded-software/black-channel) will be used in [Motional‚Äôs](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/introducing-motional-the-hyundai-motor-group-and-aptiv-autonomous-driving-joint-venture-unveils-new-identity-301109904.html) next generation driverless vehicles. \n\nMotional is backed by Hyundai, and coincidentally Hyundai just announced they will NOT be partnering with Apple for a self driving car. Could it be because they got meaningful progress on their own assets and don‚Äôt need Apple? Yes, this is just my speculation, but it‚Äôs big fucking news for BB.\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/blackberrys-qnx-black-channel-communications-130000898.html\n\nhttps://www.automotiveworld.com/news-releases/blackberrys-qnx-black-channel-communications-to-be-used-in-motionals-driverless-platform/\n\nThe technology enables Motional to provide safe data communication exchange within the vehicles safety system. Motional is expected to roll out self driving cars by 2023.\n\nHere is another [article](https://techspective.net/2021/02/01/qualcomm-google-and-blackberry-the-companies-revolutionizing-the-automobile/) that highlights why BB could be picked up by other EV plays. The highlight being:\n\n‚ÄúBlackberry has the most secure high-volume operating system on the planet, with QNX, which is being used on car operations... The Blackberry-Google part of this effort is rather interesting because while each potentially plays on both the control and the car‚Äôs entertainment side, they are best when working together. QNX leads with security and experience with embedded systems. Still, it doesn‚Äôt have much in terms of app support, which is a plus when you talk about the systems that drive, control, and stop the car, but a minus if you are talking about cockpit entertainment. Google‚Äôs Android platform has a ton of apps and developer support, making it less secure and more likely to get hacked, tolerable for the entertainment systems in a car but unacceptable for anything to do with car safety. Working in tandem, Working together, Blackberry secures the result, ensuring the car is reliable and safe.\n‚Äî‚Äî\n\nBB timeline in the past 3 months: Partners with Amazon. Partners with Baidu (The Chinese Google). Partners with Motional (EV). Don‚Äôt be deterred by the fluctuation due to the panic selling from the meme stock halt, this is fucking taking off again and this time it will stick without the bullshit.\n\nTLDR: Always do what you feel is right for yourself and only invest within your means/ risk tolerance because I am not a financial advisor. My bias opinion is pick up some BB before you miss the fucking rocket. CEO Chen even [tweeted](https://twitter.com/JohnChen/status/1358853064153784321?s=20) out some hints of the events to come.\n\nKeep in mind that it has multiple sources giving BB a target price of $25-$30 that were given BEFORE the partnership with Motional. Recently Zack‚Äôs upgraded stock to a ‚Äú#2 Strong buy‚Äù with a target of 29.00, and Motley also ranked it a #1 buy with a target price of 30.00. [Yahoo Finance](https://www.google.com/amp/s/ca.finance.yahoo.com/amphtml/news/blackberry-tsx-bb-stock-keep-143027800.html) also looking bullish. Here is also the new CEO of Amazon‚Äôs [thoughts](https://mobile.twitter.com/ajassy/status/1334191176883191808?lang=en) as well. \n\nOverall BB is currently up 73% just this past month and 170% the past 3 months.

This has (besides 2020) only happened a few times since 2010. To really make a buck, the 2nd VIX future needs to rise above 40 which hasn't really happened between 2010 and 2020.\n2. On average you will lose ~100 USD per roll just because of contango between the VIX futures, not including time decay which you are also partly affected by.\n3. Much more common slight increases in Volatility (to about ~30) cause you bigger losses (short call loses more than the long calls gain), these happen on average once per year.\n\nIf you now assume that over a 10 year period every month you hedge yourself with this strategy, you lose ~ 100 USD per month due to contango and time decay (total of 12k USD in losses, not including losses from slight vola increases). You will have 3-4 small winners and maybe 1 big winner of 4-5k USD.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is don't run this strategy blindly every month, you lose more during low vola times than you gain when the crash comes.", "score": 24, "replies": [{"body": "1.

Same as #1, I'm not sure but I think as long as there is enough time left the long calls profit more.

I assume the Trader Workstation only shows the price at expiration no matter which date I select so I tried to simulate the position with a different option price simulator: https://imgur.com/a/6O32x2g\n\nHere it is generally true that an increase in VIX gains value, but every day the position loses quite a bit of value. By mid of March if the VIX (or more specifically the VIX Apr Future) isn't at 30 you are already at a loss. This simulation isn't the most accurate since it doesn't take into account that options are priced based on the futures and not the VIX spot price but the general idea still stands.\n\nRisk reversals can be a good strategy at low VIX levels, but VIX options are heavily skewed. Puts are significantly cheaper than Calls. If you sell a 20 Put, which is just 2 points below the current VIX you can only afford a 45+ Call.\n\nI hedge with VX and VXM Futures (mostly Calendar Spreads). I try to enter when in Contango for a profit of 1-2 points. When VIX increases the Term Curve goes into backwardation, giving me another profit when I close the position.

This contract charges a premium based on likelihood, volatility, etc.  It's like any insurance product.  Car insurance is going to cost more for a teenager.\n\nSo let's say you have 500 shares of AAPL and are never selling, but you are concerned that there will be a 20% correction within the next 3 months.\n\nYou have some choices here to protect yourself.\n\nA perfect hedge would be to short 500 shares of AAPL stock.  This is called shorting against the box.  No matter what happens to AAPL stock, you gain/lose nothing because for every dollar the stock goes down, you gain a dollar on your short position.  The problem with this strategy is that for every dollar the stock goes up, you lose a dollar on the short.  The only cost is the cost to borrow the shares from your broker to sell short, and this cost will be cheaper than the put premiums I'm about to explain.  You are essentially pausing your stock investment for as long as you have the short on. \n\nWell, what if I purchase 5 put contracts, \"at the money\" which is at a strike price matching AAPL's current price, with an expiry date 3 months from now?  So now, if AAPL drops at any time within 3 months, you can exercise that put (or sell the contracts) and basically collect how much 500 shares of AAPL dropped, minus the cost of the premium.  Yes, your original 500 shares are worth that much less, but the market just reimbursed  you.\n\nAnd if no crash happens, you get to participate in AAPL's continued rise, minus the cost of the premium.  And that's the only negative.  An ATM put with a June expiry will cost you about $1050 right now for each contract, or $5250 to protect all 500 of your shares.  If there's no market crash, it cost you $5250.  Or another way to look at it is that you just raised the cost basis of your AAPL shares by ~$10.\n\nNow, you have some other choices here with puts.  You could choose a lower strike price (premiums are cheaper).  A $120 strike put for June costs just $460 per contract.  But, you only get paid when AAPL drops below $120 a share.  This is partial protection.  You are willing to ride through a roughly 11% correction, but want disaster protection against the stock falling below $120.\n\nYou could over-protect by buying say 10 puts.  And if AAPL drops, you actually profit off a market crash.\n\nYou could purchase a put spread (buying a put, and selling a lower strike put) to reduce the cost of the premium but capping your downside protection.  Let's say you feel a minor correction is coming, just 10%.  AAPL will fall, but not below $110.  You could buy 5 $135 puts for $5250, and sell 5 $110 puts for a credit of $1250.  So for just $4000, you get paid if AAPL falls, but only down to $110.  If AAPL crashes below $110, your benefits are capped.\n\nThere are more strategies but hopefully this gives you an idea.\n\nMy main point is that if your portfolio is mostly AAPL, then buying insurance against AAPL crashing is going to be more effective than buying \"insurance\" on volatility spiking, NASDAQ crashing, etc.", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for taking the time to explain.
