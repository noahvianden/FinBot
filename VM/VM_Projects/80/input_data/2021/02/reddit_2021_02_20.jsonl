Amazon Prime Video and Hulu have been getting more of my watch-time lately and Prime is worth the cost just for the delivery benefits, the Music/Video/etc services make their subscription all the more valuable. Hulu is cheaper but their commercials playing at like 130% of the volume of the shows is super annoying.\n\nAnyway, I remember when Netflix recently announced their most recent subscription price increase that their stock responded very positively.

{"title": "Airbnb Earnings, an \"insiders\" take", "selftext": "Listen up!\n\nOr dont.\n\nAirbnb's earnings come out this week and they are projected to be -$9.17 EPS, not very good.  However, I have a strong belief that they are going to CRUSH the earnings estimate and have a very green end of the week.\n\nBut... Why?\n\nWell - besides spending far too much time here with you all, I also spend much of my time owning/managing 3 airbnb's in the Chicago area.  Annnnd I have a new one I purchased in Saugatuck, MI that I have been renovating to prepare for the spring/summer 2021.\n\nSurely this does not qualify me for anything?\n\nListen.\n\nBack in March/April 2020 when shit really started to hit the fan.  Basically ALL of our summer reservations for the Chicago units cancelled.  It was panic mode, literally cancellations left and right because of covid.  This is not news.\n\nAt the same time Airbnb was in panic mode, they trimmed 1,900 of 7,500 employees.  Oof.\n\nThen something miraculous happened.  We began getting bookings again for the summer.  Many more, and bookings were over double in the average length we normally get (read = more profitable). Very soon our entire summer was booked as normal with a new type of guest.  We were seeing many people who now had the freedom to work wherever they wanted travel to Chicago for weeks on end, rather than a weekend.  They would just work M-F and then explore when they wanted.  It was a new type of Work-Vacation? if you will.\n\nOur summer revenue was right on par with what we would consider a \"normal\" summer - truly remarkable given the circumstances.\n\nFast forward - I am living in Michigan prepping the new Airbnb.  I frequent the downtown area and chat up many of the shop owners to get a feel for the area and what the past summer was like as this is a major vacation destination.  In short, every shop owner reported the same thing.  Every weekend was like the 4th of July (typically the busiest weekend of all summer).  Basically all fo them reported that they saw record numbers of people and absolutely smashed their previous \"best months\" of sales and what not.  This trend has continued all the way through January 2021 I've heard, shops reporting record January sales.\n\nIn addition to this there is swaths of data showing the trending increase in short term rentals like Airbnb, VRBO, Home Away, etc.  and a trending decline in hotels.  I don't anticipate this trend changes anytime soon.\n\nSo. In summary.\n\nAirbnb anticipated the worst (as did I) and trimmed employees to cut major costs.\n\nWhat actually happened was a mini boom in short term rental demand as people sought alternatives vacations that did not require flying and people took advantage of remote work.\n\nAirbnb cut costs anticipating the worst, then saw comparable levels if not increased levels of business in many markets.\n\nI think Airbnb is going to crush earnings and am YOLO'ing the rest of my deteriorating account into calls expiring Friday.\n\nI do not work for Airbnb or anything, I am simply a friendly host who is overly confident in his ability to predict the future.\n\nI hope I don't get banned or get this removed cause I can't show my positions, but I had this epiphany today and obviously can't buy calls till Monday, but you can bet your wife's boyfriend's Tesla that that is what I'm doing.\n\nEdit - I'm in with 217.5 and 210 strikes expiring Friday.  Only 1 contract each, which is in fact all I can do with the money still in my account.

So even if a big portion or the Airbnb market in the US wasn’t affected as much it’s overseas business will have suffered and will continue to suffer especially as people in areas with bad recessions might not be able to own multiple properties to live in/rent out. As an example take Dublin; a city which in terms of hotels and guest rooms is at a near constant 100% capacity regardless of time of year, it’s hardly broken 50% for most of the past 12 months and rent prices (usually rising if a lot of holiday flats exist) have fallen for the firsts time in years because holiday flats are transformed back into residential use for lack of customers.
