{"title": "A little bit different: $NUSI - a fund that follows QQQ but sells covered calls OTM and buys protective puts OTM. Acts like a bond, monthly dividend ~7.8%", "selftext": "Hi, thetagang!\n\nI want to talk about how we pad our portfolios to hedge risk in this current market.  If interest rates weren't super low, I think a careful bond blend would be enough.  But... that's not the case.\n\nAnyways, there is a great alternative to bonds that outperforms $QYLD and $JEPI but is stable enough to consider it a 'risk-hedge'.  Most people have probably heard of [$NUSI](http://go.hvm.com/NUSI-outperformance?), but I just wanted to dive deeper into the fund, its alternatives, and why it fits into the r/thetagang strategies so well.\n\n**Why am I posting about this in** r/thetagang ?\n\nFirst off, please don't remove this post.  I'm writing about $NUSI in r/thetagang because this fund is more than r/dividends can handle.  Secondly, I'm *literally afraid* of WSB right now, so this is the only place I have left to go.\n\n**My excitement about $NUSI is that it is an alternative tool (to bonds) that could nicely pad an otherwise aggressive (AKA Thetagang) strategy using the same thetagang secrets and techniques for success.**  In other words, the market is currently ripe for funds like $NUSI (and the collar strategy in general).\n\n**Just a brief review of the performance of $NUSI**\n\n[Funds like $NUSI aren't meant to be analyzed in the short-term, but $NUSI is brand new.  So investing in it is a bit more speculative.](https://preview.redd.it/0gt5kvnwvvf61.png?width=2104&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=d8a783e6e0b596eb3e71817ada07cf21759e361e)\n\n**How does $NUSI work?**\n\n[$NUSI](http://go.hvm.com/NUSI-outperformance?) is a risk-managed fund that sells net credit collar spreads to generate income and provide downside protection for investors that cannot (or will not) trade their own options.\n\nRemember, a collar is an options strategy limiting both gains and losses that is traditionally established by holding an underlying stock, buying an out-of-the-money put option, and selling an out-of-the-money call option.\n\n[Income from net realized capital gains are distributed annually.](https://preview.redd.it/l8xq9bzkgvf61.png?width=1810&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=1187875f4333994b6209ae56c24c885edb36790a)\n\n**$NUSI promises a mostly constructive return of capital because of OTM calls.**\n\nDistributions, regardless of their sources, are deducted from the Fund‚Äôs NAV, so **if the Fund has a total return that is greater than or equal to its distribution rate, and any portion of that distribution is attributed to a ROC, then that would be deemed a constructive return of capital.**  That is mostly what $NUSI promises.\n\n[At the end of the fiscal year, the ACTUAL amounts and sources of the distributions generated by the Fund over the applicable reporting period may be determined to be from net investment income \\(NII\\), short‚Äêterm gains, long‚Äêterm gains \\(to the extent permitted by law\\), and return of capital.](https://preview.redd.it/c56retirkvf61.png?width=1996&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=8fb4f9b280c6b14262779fd3624b8df8f2e3743f)\n\n**Here is a picture of $NUSI's dividend history:**\n\n[Thank you to fidelity for this info](https://preview.redd.it/lfx7p7kzkvf61.png?width=1604&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=982684c5561c7c9931119e5760a9ac66f33a7e80)\n\n**Now let's talk about how the current market responds to the $NUSI net credit collar strategy**\n\nWe are still in a bull market.  See below\n\n[When the market trends upward, the Fund‚Äôs managers have the ability to close the short call option, thereby ‚Äúuncapping‚Äù the portfolio which may consequently allow for potential appreciation stemming from the underlying equity portfolio.  However, in a rising market, the Fund may potentially underperform the broader equity market, with the sale of the index call option at a predefined strike price capping upside.  The majority of the income generated by the Fund will be sourced from equity appreciation and underlying equity dividends, with a smaller amount being derived from options premium, particularly in a low volatility environment.](https://preview.redd.it/nr51gouhhvf61.png?width=1458&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=cbd4a8ea8bbd9f339887f860f1fcf1d96e796447)\n\n**In a flat market**, like what is predicted for the next decade, funds like $NUSI (or the collar strategy in general) can also potentially benefit from a total return which equals the annual distribution.\n\n[ In a sideways market during which the equity benchmark remains relatively static, the sale of the call option may aid in supporting the generation of premium which the investor retains.  Further, the constant hedge continues to protect against potential losses in the equity portfolio, with the retention of the underlying equity holdings allowing for future appreciation.  Now, the majority of the income would be generated from options premium, with a smaller portion stemming from the dividends from the Fund‚Äôs underlying equity portfolio. ](https://preview.redd.it/zz6esoblivf61.png?width=1446&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=dfc51246f103bccc3a2eba750426cc59262d2f05)\n\n**In a declining market**, as we all fear, funds like $NUSI would benefit from increased volatility that potentially increases options premium derived from the call option and from gains in the put option.\n\n[ In a down or declining market, it is reasonably anticipated that the Fund will post solid relative performance. In this environment, the strategy will sustain its generation of premium from the index call option, assuming that the market decline does not make the Nasdaq-100 index put option relevant.  It may underperform in this environment if the positioning \\(i.e. strike price\\) of the portfolio hedge exceeds the magnitude of the market decline.   The majority of the income generated would come from options premium, accrued gains in the underlying equities from prior periods, underlying equity dividends, and potentially, current period gains from the put options appreciating in value.  ](https://preview.redd.it/3tpkgr8zivf61.png?width=1445&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=b3abe7b996a214acf3248336c44f9538cdc83f85)\n\n**What about alternatives to $NUSI?**\n\n[ Distribution yield\\* vs other income-oriented investments \\(as of 1\\/31\\/21\\) ](https://preview.redd.it/4lmwrff0gvf61.png?width=1089&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=99c914fd12150a11ef2e9dc60a17f8f9f98bea40)\n\n**What about $QYLD and $JEPI?**\n\nI suppose it depends on your goals and risk tolerance.  I like that $NUSI sells OTM calls and buys OTM puts.  It's too new to be sure of this, but I suspect it will outperform similar funds (like JEPI and QYLD).\n\n* [$QYLD](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/fund/qyld) sells ATM covered calls on QQQ and has a higher monthly dividend but less growth and downside protection than $NUSI.  It is about 1% per month, as opposed to about 0.65% per month in $NUSI.  r/Dividends loves this shit, as they don't look at growth and ignore its relatively significant underperformance since March 2020.  This is good for cash preservation, has a good expense ratio, and they've had consistent returns - but QYLD is not tax efficient.\n* [$JEPI](https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/products/jpmorgan-equity-premium-income-etf-46641q332?c3apidt=p53932207041&amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAmfmABhCHARIsACwPRADQVWHdRqWhhPtvD5TwnqrVbqVSrAYlVe6yG_pZf2I2jq_HAOtV3rQaAuhNEALw_wcB&amp;amp;gclsrc=aw.ds) generates income through a combination of selling options and investing in U.S. large-cap stocks, seeking to deliver a monthly income stream from associated option premiums and stock dividends.  It's an actively managed fund, too, that constructs a diversified, low volatility equity portfolio.  $JEPI also has limited upside due to the use of equity-linked notes, but you get paid a nice premium from them as well.  As long as the stock market increases below whatever the strike price is they are selling, then you will outperform the market on total returns.   **The more sideways, the more a fund like $JEPI beats the market.**\n   * The mutual fund equivalent is [JEPIX](https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/gim/adv/products/d/jpmorgan-equity-premium-income-fund-i-46645v675): Its inception date is August 2018, and its total return since inception is 4.5%. Not hugely impressive, but better than QYLD's (TR since the same date is 0.38%), so perhaps it is a reasonable option if it fits your needs. Both JEPIX and QYLD have lower volatility than SPY (obvi)\n\nOne last thing: investing takes patience.  $NUSI (or the collar strategy in general) would add a great pad to your portfolio, but mostly to empower your put and call selling.  $NUSI is a bond alternative that may provide investors with greater flexibility across different market cycles, **aid in supplementing current income,** and as a complement to a traditional **60/40 allocation.**  It is currently outperforming $QYLD and $JEPI.\n\nThat's it.  Thanks for reading (if you made it through).  **Good luck everyone.  Would love to hear questions, opposing ideas, and thoughts.**\n\n*Disclaimer: I'm not a financial advisor, this is not financial advice, I'm just excited about this ETF and the collar strategy in general.*  ***I'm long in $NUSI, XYLD, QYLD, RYLD and SRET.

Nobody will ever KNOW.  Taking advice from anyone on the internet or in real life, especially when finances are involved is idiotic.  Quickly think about every comment you‚Äôve made pumping GME with rockets and Diamond emojis this month?  Ever wonder why you were doing that?  Because you had a particular interest and benefit of the stock price going up ‚Äî that‚Äôs pumping so you can get the price high enough for you to make money and then leave the others in the dust.  This is the exact thing pumpers are doing to you.  It is VITAL that you stop relying on Reddit comments, start doing research, and put your time to good use since time is in fact, money.\n\n‚Ä¢ *The market is so manipulated, it‚Äôs completely unfair and the hedge funds always get away with it!*\n\n- Yes.  You‚Äôre right & that is a healthy and intelligent observation.  The unfortunate truth is this will keep happening.

It is important you begin to study and understand the trends and statistics behind the actual market.  Please, the slightest bit of REAL research could lead to your next play ‚Äî the one that could save you from this GME mess.  If you learned how to trade options you could‚Äôve bought puts and at least balanced out your losses on your GME shares on the way down instead of just eating those bags.\n\n‚Ä¢ *So what, I just sell my GME shares for a huge loss?*\n\n- No.  I would never instruct anybody to sell or buy anything.  That‚Äôs the entire point of this post.  To encourage others to learn how instruct themselves in the stock market (considering how many of you are completely new & your first trade may have possibly been one of the most volatile in recent history).  Keep your shares, that‚Äôs the beauty of shares is that you own them and over time that value may eventually come back, especially if you use other equity to generate enough money to average down your position over time & eventually come out on top.  The only way you will achieve this though is removing GME from your watchlist for a while, studying up & finding new tickers with real promise instead of ‚Äúshort squeeze‚Äù opportunities and quick spike situations where you will inevitably be fucked.\n\n‚Ä¢ *I used all my money on this last play, I can‚Äôt do anything now*\n\n- Even if that is the case, I‚Äôd hope you still have an income or the ability to collect some money over the next few weeks and months WHILE YOU STUDY.

{"title": "Corsair ($CRSR) DD", "selftext": "Full disclosure, I am a shareholder so my opinions can be biased.\n\nThis is not financial advice but I have tried to do some DD on this so please read to the end.\n\nFor those of you who might not know what Corsair is, they are a computer parts and peripherals company founded in 1994 that went public in September of 2020. If you have a desktop PC, keyboard, mouse, or are a streamer, chances are you have seen their logo. Corsair Gaming ($CRSR) reports earnings this coming week on Tuesday. In light of that, I have put together a few insights that some of you may find interesting.\n\nEarnings. Tuesday February 9th\n\nFirst, a look at the previous quarter‚Äôs earnings (Q3 2020)\n\n**Q3 2020 Highlights**\n\n\\- Net revenue was $457.1 million, an **increase of 60.7%** year over year\n\n\\- Gamer and creator peripherals net revenue was $161.6 million, an **increase of 128.8%** year over year\n\n\\- Gross profit was $129.9 million, an **increase of 112.4%** year over year\n\n\\- Gross margin was 28%, an **increase of 680 bps** (that‚Äôs 6.8%)\n\n\\- Gamer and creator peripherals segment gross profit was $60 million, an **increase of 200.8%** year over year\n\n\\- Gaming components and systems segment gross profit was $67.9 million, an increase of 68.7% year over year\n\n\\- Operating income was $49.7 million, an **increase of 353.6%** year-over-year\n\n\\- Adjusted operating income was $61.4 million, an **increase of 193.7%** year-over-year\n\n\\- Net income was $36.4 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, compared to net income of $1.5 million in the same period a year ago, or $0.02 per diluted share\n\n\\- **Adjusted net income was $48.5 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, an increase of 384.0% year-over-year compared to adjusted net income of $10.0 million, or $0.13 per diluted share.**\n\n**-** Adjusted EBITDA was $63.7 million, an **increase of 184.9%** year-over-year, with adjusted EBITDA margin of 13.9%, an **improvement of 610 bps** year-over-year\n\n**Q3 Earnings Call Highlights (quotes from the call)**\n\n\\- ‚ÄúThis last quarter was one with very strong demand, with many major retailers running out of stock of our gear. Our stock situation has gotten better but only a small part of Q3 revenue came from restocking shelves, **with most gear selling as soon as they hit the shelves**.‚Äù\n\n\\- ‚ÄúWe also recently launched two new microphones under our Elgato brand, Wave 1 and Wave 3, **which were sold out within the first few days of launch**.‚Äù\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Catalysts for Growth**\n\nAccording to data released by the International Data Corporation (IDC),\n\n\\- Global gaming PC shipments are expected to jump by 25% by 2024, while **global shipments of gaming laptops, desktop PCs, and monitors jumped 16.2% year over year in 2020 with December 2020 seeing the highest sales of PC components and peripherals on record**.\n\n**-** IDC predicts 2021 to witness a real surge in gaming PCs as new graphics processing units from Nvidia, AMD and Intel are expected to drive prices down and performance up.\n\n**- Global gaming PC sales revenue has jumped 60% in the past 5 years.** In 2015 the global gaming PC market reached $24.6 billion in revenue, which has increased to $39.2 billion in 2020. High end gaming computers represent the largest revenue stream in 2020 at $18.5 billion or 47% of combined profits in 2020\n\n\\- Not only will Corsair be able to capitalize on a gaming PC super cycle upgrade with new GPUs but on October 22, 2020, Corsair announced the launch of their first officially licensed headset for Microsoft Xbox. Corsair will also be able to capitalize on the Sony Playstation and Microsoft Xbox console super cycle using their headsets and Scuf Gaming controllers for consoles. Corsair currently holds patents on several console controllers, Microsoft has licensed these patents to create the Xbox Elite Controller.\n\n\\- According to Corsair\n\n\\- There were 2.6 billion gamers (across all platforms) as of 2019\n\n\\- 11% of leisure time in the US is spent on gaming\n\n\\- 12 billion hours of gaming content was streamed in 2019\n\n\\- 71% of millennial gamers in the US watch gaming content on streaming platforms\n\n\\- Corsair will be able to capture this enormous rise in streaming using their Elgato line of products which enhance the ability of content creators to stream.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Market Share**\n\n\\- Pulled from Corsairs S-1 filing, they currently command over **18% of the US market share in gaming peripherals and nearly 42% of the gaming PC components market share**. This will allow them to capture a substantial portion of revenues from the global gaming peripherals market size which is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate **(CAGR) of 10.4**% from 2020 to 2025 according to grand view research.\n\n  \n\n**Ranking of Corsair‚Äôs Total US Market Share by Product:**\n\n**-** Keyboards: 2nd\n\n\\- Mice: 3rd\n\n\\- Headsets: 4th\n\n\\- Streaming Peripherals: 2nd\n\n\\- Performance Controllers: 2nd \n\n\\- Memory: 1st \n\n\\- Cases: 1st \n\n\\- Power Supply Units: 1st \n\n\\- Cooling Solutions: 1st \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**-** Releases of gaming content with ever-higher graphical requirements will drive consumers to upgrade their components and subsequently their peripherals as well.\n\n\\- **Corsair gaming is an ecosystem of products with a strong and recognizable brand which creates extreme brand loyalty amongst its customers.** This is more of a personal opinion but through my own experience and observation, it seems that when a customer goes to upgrade 1 component from Corsair, several hundred dollars later they come out the other side purchasing a number of internal PC components and have upgraded all of their peripherals (keyboard and mouse), but this is anecdotal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Q4 Earnings & Beyond** (released before the bell on Tuesday February 9th).\n\nThese are predictions and can obviously be taken with a grain of salt but I hope you can understand my rationale\n\n\\- I believe we will see a huge beat on Tuesday‚Äôs earnings release. This will be led by the compounding effects of the pandemic stay at home orders along-side an extremely strong holiday season. According to the site: Super Data, sales of digital games experienced a record number at $12 billion in December alone. This was the highest monthly revenue on record with PC games taking the lion‚Äôs share of this with a year over year revenue jump of 40% thanks to Cyberpunk 2077. This extremely high demand for PC games will drive the upgrading cycle and demand for Corsairs PC components and their peripherals.\n\n\\- I also believe that Corsair is a long term hold with substantial growth potential as the adoption of gaming grows.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Competitor Comparison**\n\n**-** Corsair is frequently compared to Logitech.\n\n\\- Logitech currently has a market cap of $18.63 billion, Corsair has a market cap of $4.15 billion.\n\n\\- Logitech is expected to post 2020 fiscal year end revenue at $2.9 billion, Corsair is expected to post 2020 fiscal year end revenue at $1.65 billion.\n\n\\- Logitech is expected to post 2020 fiscal year end operating income at $300 million, Corsair is expected to post 2020 fiscal year end operating income at $192 million.\n\n\\- Logitech currently has 169 million shares outstanding with a float of 162 million share float (6% is shorted), Corsair currently has 92 million shares outstanding with a 25 million share float (24% is shorted)\n\n**I believe Corsair is severely undervalued**", "id": "le74iq", "created_utc": 1612646412.0, "score": 396, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 85, "comments": [{"body": "Ive been holding 5/21 $45 calls since nov. they are almost back to my buy price.

Their ram is about averaged price for the timings and speed, definitely not overpriced. I run off-brand ram but I think savings wise it's only maybe 10-20 bucks more for corsair. A huge selling point for enthusiasts even is that alot of their ram uses samsung b dies. B dies are really good for tightening timings or overclocking ram. \n\nCorasair has a lot of 'pretty' rgb gear cheaper than some competitors that bring alot of new builders in. Not an rgb person, but it's the trend currently. Also, corsairs water cooling aios (honestly guys aios suck but to each their own) are competitively priced. Alot of builders think aios cool better/look cooler so they buy them. \n\nAnother thing, corsair offers power supplies for every price point nearly. Now these run a wide range from A tier to \"this will blow up pc parts\" tier(they have like one in this category, otherwise mostly tier a b c or d), but it's important that they have a psu for anyone looking to build a pc\n\nI don't think their gear is 100% worth the price but then again people still buy razer.

It is true they don't make high value items like RAM and performance PSUs which can attract a high premium/margin onto, but Corsair sell to an inherently smaller audience. I just think that smaller audience is generally willing to part with more money than your typical Logitech customer. Same outcome, different reasons.\n\nWill be holding long term.
