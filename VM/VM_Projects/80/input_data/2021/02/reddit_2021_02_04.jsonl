Thank old Joe!\n\nJust google “top solar companies” and tell me which have the best product and best customer ratings.\n\nSunpower is currently at a peak of a year long run up and now is nearly 60% available shares shorted. \n\nWhat most people don’t know, is, that Sunpower has started to roll out a new product that will consume market share from everyone’s favorite, Tesla. The product is called SunVault. SunVault is an energy storage battery that very well competes and rivals the Tesla power wall. I believe that SunVault will sell extremely well and could bring Sunpower up to Tesla levels in terms of solar and energy storage. The product is capable of powering your home for nearly 3 days. And when combined with the high efficiency panels that Sunpower offers, it’s game changing. \n\nSunVault only started rolling out last summer and Solar doesn’t really pick up till the summer. So getting in now before the busy season may be advantageous.\n\nIf you are looking for a company that is fundamentally strong and has a high upside in a huge market, SPWR really could be something to consider.\n\nthis is not investment advice.

Combine this with an eventual movement towards non-carbon power.\n\nSo I went out and bought the solar ETF \\`TAN\\`, but then I also made a number of individual purchases such as SPWR. They were all flat for the first few years, but now they are all taking off, SPWR probably most of all. And the rate of improvement of solar seems to be continuing on the trend and not slowing.

{"title": "Canoo (GOEV)", "selftext": "Ok here is my first shot at a DD. I've been eyeing this company Canoo (GOEV) for a little while. I'm long 1200 shares @ a cost of $15.28\n\n[https://www.canoo.com/](https://www.canoo.com/)\n\nCanoo is a new EV start-up that plans to have a vehicle subscription service. From their investor presentation, it looks like they estimate $90,000 revenue on a car over 12 years. That means the cost per month for their subscription model is $625 per month, all in, no down payment, no insurance cost, they take care of maintenance, etc.\n\nLink: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1750153/000121390020022608/ea125677ex99-2\\_hennessy.htm?fbclid=IwAR2as\\_F2t-ZrmXWjKGvDLROdeSmL5ByctPw3W0VuqEcOHYjZggG3d5FX4T4](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1750153/000121390020022608/ea125677ex99-2_hennessy.htm?fbclid=IwAR2as_F2t-ZrmXWjKGvDLROdeSmL5ByctPw3W0VuqEcOHYjZggG3d5FX4T4)\n\nNow, I know that seems a bit expensive but it seems that $625/mon is cheaper than the low end of the average of owning a gas-powered car at $750-916/mon. It has a barrier-of-entry because there is no down payment. I don't know how that will play out with most people. I personally like owning my own vehicle, but it could be popular with younger people because again, they wouldn't need to worry about any maintenance or insurance. Now, I do think their subscription model would be very popular among large companies that need a cheap, low-maintenance fleet of vehicles. I hope they're trying to land a contract with a company like UPS or FedEx.\n\nWhat I like most about this company is their \"skateboard\" platform which is the bottom half of the car. From my understanding, they would just need to crash test one of each skateboard. Any vehicle, regardless of the configuration, would also have that crash rating, which is an amazing cost saving when they can sell a bunch of units to a larger car manufacture, like Hyundai, with whom they already have a partnership.\n\nLink: [https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21133461/hyundai-canoo-electric-cars-partership-kia](https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21133461/hyundai-canoo-electric-cars-partership-kia)  \n\n\nIt is reported that Apple tried to buy Canoo in 2020 but Canoo turned them down. Apple has apparently partnered with Hyundai to enter the EV-space, I think because Apple really liked Canoo's customizable platform. Apple couldn't buy them so they joined them in a roundabout way.\n\n[https://www.slashgear.com/apple-canoo-acquisition-investment-report-electric-vehicle-skateboard-platform-autonomous-ev-roadmap-13654915/](https://www.slashgear.com/apple-canoo-acquisition-investment-report-electric-vehicle-skateboard-platform-autonomous-ev-roadmap-13654915/)  \n\n\nHaving said all that, they won't have any vehicles out until 2022 so be wary of that, but this is a long-term hold for me.\n\nCanoo (GOEV) currently trades at $16.40, hitting its all-time high at $22.30 in December.

{"title": "Time to Buy a Real Stock : AMD (Kill The Shorts Part 2)", "selftext": "I know we’ve had our fun with GME and I’m sure it still has a shot to go up. However, let me re-introduce you to a real stock: **AMD**. 🚀🚀\n\nAt $88 a share, we’re looking at massive upside. And instead of buying GME at $83, why not buy something that actually has some long term value? Oh and did I mention it’s one of the most shorted stocks this month? [https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/articles/most-shorted-stocks](https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/articles/most-shorted-stocks)\n\n**That’s $6.7 billion in short interest.** That’s larger than the actual current market cap of GME. Let’s actually make a dent here. These fuckers **added 17% more shorted shares** in the last month. You're gonna tell me their diamond hands are better than OUR DIAMOND HANDS 💎💎💎?\n\nAs our savior Elon Tweeted today : “I am become meme, destroyer of shorts.”\n\n[https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1357269755112148993](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1357269755112148993)\n\nLet’s make him proud.\n\nOk, now for some DD so you guys know I’m not talking out of my ass.\n\n# Fundamentals:\n\nTheir latest ER:\n\n**Crossed $3 billion in sales threshold for the first time, INCREASING YOY by 52%**\n\n**Full year sales of $9.76 billion**\n\nServer revenue doubled year over year which is absolutely incredible because that means they are actually going toe to toe with the big boys like IBM.\n\nMassive increase in guidance. They’re **expecting 37% growth** this year.\n\nSo why did they drop from their ER? Well, it was because of next-gen chip shortages through the first half of 2021. But let’s be real here, this is a joke compared to the issues Intel is facing with their next-gen.\n\nObviously, we’d prefer if they never had a shortage, but I mean if you’re gonna have a problem it might as well be this one. This news is LITERALLY SAYING, “hey we have too many orders and we can’t keep up sorry, we’ll get it to you ASAP”\n\nImagine thinking this company isn’t going to bounce back and go to new ATH in the next month or two.\n\nOur queen, Lisa Su, said “there will be added capacity” in the second half of the year. This is perfect, because that means by the time next holiday season comes around they’ll be good to go. I wouldn’t worry about these shortages. They are running at full capacity and we should expect their sales to increase throughout the year.\n\n**Some loser (**u/aatop**) decided to call out Market Share issues in my last post so here's a section just for him:**\n\nIntel gained back 0.7% of market share in Q4 across the CPU market as a whole. Whoop de doo!\n\n**In the last month ALONE, AMD gained back 3%.** Here's a little business lesson. Ups and downs happen. No growth company is going to have growth every single month/quarter. I don't care who they are. There are hiccups. Don't let some negative nancys make you believe that a hiccup means AMD's market growth is ending.\n\n**AMD actually GAINED on Intel in the CPU server secto**r. What does that tell you? That **boomers are actually converting to AMD** for their company. And we all know that these boomer companies have all the money for now.\n\n# Technicals:\n\nFor those of you who care about lines on a chart, I got you as well.\n\nWe really have two things to look out for. We have a resistance (that used to be a strong support) at 88. But we’re basically there right now.\n\nIn addition, the last few weeks before ER, we were in that 89-97 channel. What does that mean? Well, once we get going here **AMD will shoot up to $97 and from there we can retest ATH.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/49t9dzxqghf61.png?width=1988&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a45e5768cdd5fad74cfa67b2544f46065135d47\n\nFor more squiggly lines, the MACD is about to cross the signal line so we could see some bullish sentiment here. And of course the RSI is near the bottom of the range, but honestly who cares about that anyway.\n\n# Conclusion/TLDR:\n\nMy point is that more than half of you fuckers run AMD in your machine anyway and the other half is waiting for their stimulus check to buy the new Ryzen series. The new investors here are all sad from GME, but now it’s time to put your big boy pants on and get into something that has some real value behind it. You got questions? Leave em in the comments and I’ll answer.\n\n**Positions: 4/16/2021 100c, 97.5c 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**\n\nThis is not financial advice.
