If you believe GME will go  bankrupt within the next few months, then my thesis is completely  broken.\n\nThe shortsellers were betting on bankruptcy. That's why they dared to  short GME >100%. If GME went bankrupt, they would get more money than  what GME was initially worth.\n\nThat's literally printing money out of thin air. But it absolutely  requires GME to become bankrupt, so that the extra shorted shares will  never ever have to be bought back.\n\nNow, if we can agree GME won't go bankrupt at this point. So what happens next?\n\nWhen the share price drops, 3 things happen:\n\n1. paper handers sell\n2. diamond handers buy\n3. short sellers must cover\n\nAs prices drop, #1 will get fewer as they sell. Since share price won't  go to 0, #3 will want to cover at the dip as much as possible. #2 will  buy in massively. At this stage, liquidity evaporates. What happens  then? MOASS.\n\nThis is why you see the drop in VW's short squeeze graph right before their squeeze. The trigger for the squeeze is Porsche announcing its big dick stake, which immediately made everyone realize that VW stock is no longer liquid.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlternatively, we might see a $TSLA like slow squeeze, as earning numbers come in and short close out slowly 1 by 1 from the bottom up.

{"title": "How to prevent your $GME shares from being used for short ladder attacks", "selftext": "Fellow apes:\n\nThanks to [a comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb6aiq/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_february_03_2021/glt6vxo?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) from /u/Guildish, I was prompted to look into how to prevent my $GME shares from being used by hedge funds for the short ladder attacks we've been seeing these past couple days. Our brokerages are allowed to lend out our shares as long as there are no open orders on them. So, put a daily sell limit order on all of your shares (at a reasonable 3x-4x the price that day) so that they can't be lent out. A website I also found helpful information from:\n\n[https://www.contracts-for-difference.com/borrowing-lending-shares.html](https://www.contracts-for-difference.com/borrowing-lending-shares.html)\n\nStay strong, buy the dips, and hold, fellow retards!\n\nDisclaimer: This is not financial advice. I just like the stock. I am a retard and please do your research.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I am not advising anyone. I bought 15 shares at \\~$290 last Wednesday, and tomorrow I'm putting my daily sell limit order at $5k lmao. And probably buying more tomorrow!\n\nEdit 2: I‚Äôve noticed my email shows some comments that look like they didn‚Äôt make it through due to new accounts/low karma, but I‚Äôll try to answer the genuine questions through edits. Someone asked what platform I am using, and I use Vanguard. I‚Äôve never had any issues with them, and they don‚Äôt limit how many $GME or $AMC shares I can buy.\n\nEdit 3: Buying stocks with Vanguard is pretty straightforward. If you need help, feel free to PM me. Someone mentioned that the short ladders cause a placement of an artificial ceiling, meaning huge gains can‚Äôt be made. I‚Äôm not an expert by any means whatsoever, but if you look at the 2008 VW squeeze chart, that proves not to be true. Also, someone mentioned TD Ameritrade is limiting the sell limit. Go as high as it will let you, and if you don‚Äôt feel comfortable with that, it‚Äôs okay. If worse comes to worst, get a Vanguard account, buy shares through them, and set your sell limits to the stars.\n\nEdit 4: Do not buy your shares on margin! A few of you have let me know that shares bought with cash accounts cannot be used for short attacks. Not sure if you all can see their comment, but /u/Germanicusss has advised to ‚Äúpay down your margin debt and/or instruct your broker to move the shred into your cash account‚Äù. I need to do more research into that. Another reminder that this is not financial advise and I‚Äôm not an expert.

{"title": "Let's talk about taxes: both realized gains and realized losses (USA only)", "selftext": "I know everybody is getting super excited about GME, AMC, NOK, or BB going üöÄüöÄüöÄ, but have you thought about taxes? I am not a tax advisor, but I did some research and wanted to make you guys aware of these things before the next tax season comes around and your jaws drop because Uncle Sammy wants a cut of your tendies.\n\n**LET'S START WITH CAPITAL LOSSES:**\n\nI know a handful of you do not care if you end up holding the bag. But also consider this: you can use these losses to **REDUCE YOUR TAX BILL**. You can only do this if you do not have any capital gains or your capital losses is greater than your capital gains for the year (you have more losses than gains). Unfortunately you can **only deduct up to $3,000 per year** ($1,500 if married filing separately), so please don't risk more than you can afford. If you do happen to lose more than $3,000, I suggest only selling some shares at a time each year (probably around December) up to a loss of $3,000. The deduction used to be $4,000 so it can change year to year. **(Please see edit below for losses >$3,000).**\n\n**CAPITAL GAINS (WHEN YOU COLLECT YOUR TENDIES):**\n\nThere are two different capital gains you can realize after you sell your shares: short term (<=1 year) and long term (>1 year).\n\nShort term gains are taxed as ordinary income. What does that mean? It's essentially added together with your salary.\n\n**Marginal Rates:** For tax year 2021, the top tax rate remains 37% for individual single taxpayers with incomes greater than $523,600 ($628,300 for married couples filing jointly). The other rates are:\n\n* 35%, for incomes over $209,425 ($418,850 for married couples filing jointly);\n* 32% for incomes over $164,925 ($329,850 for married couples filing jointly);\n* 24% for incomes over $86,375 ($172,750 for married couples filing jointly);\n* 22% for incomes over $40,525 ($81,050 for married couples filing jointly);\n* 12% for incomes over $9,950 ($19,900 for married couples filing jointly).\n* The lowest rate is 10% for incomes of single individuals with incomes of $9,950 or less ($19,900 for married couples filing jointly).\n\nSource: [https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-provides-tax-inflation-adjustments-for-tax-year-2021](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-provides-tax-inflation-adjustments-for-tax-year-2021)\n\nLong term gains follow a different set of rules as follows:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h41xq22pb6f61.png?width=825&format=png&auto=webp&s=96fb44b73e7c83cf4b326bf24c44cd7864dc7875\n\nThese are just general information. Please consult with a tax advisor as everyone's financial situations are different.\n\nAlso: there's a handful of you making donations which is freaking awesome. You should save those receipts as those donations can also be used to deduct your taxes. I currently cannot find info that would make sense (I guess I'm just as retarded as everyone else here). *(Edit: This only applies if you do an itemized deduction. Too lazy and complicated for me unless you have a smart tax advisor)*\n\nIf you got anything else I should add or inaccuracies in these info, I'll be sure to edit them. If this doesn't get approved as a post, then I just wasted the last few hours researching and typing this up.\n\n***Full Disclosure: I am not a tax advisor.

{"title": "5 REASONS WHY WE WILL HAVE A STOCK MARKET CORRECTION IN FEBRUARY", "selftext": " Fellow autists, I have listed below 5 reasons why we will see a market pullback probably in February. I know everything is about $GME at the moment, but this has to do with $GME too. If Melvin Capital has to close its doors, the market will likely see a major pullback due to them reducing long positions etc.  \nHave a read below:\n\n* **February is statistically the 2nd worst month in the year**  \nStatistically, February is the second worst month for stocks, right after September. Citing historical data dating back to 1928, stocks see an average decline of 0.11% in February, a median return of just 0.27%, and are positive only 52.7% of the time. This indicates that the average sell-off is greater than a market rally, as market gain is slightly more likely. Additionally, the current put/call ratio is signaling a sense of complacency among investors, \"[a sign that is typically seen near market tops](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-outlook-correction-risk-increasing-resistance-levels-bofa-2021-1-1030000521)\", so Bank of America. CFRA's Sam Stovall also notes, that t[he negative trend is more pronounced during a president‚Äôs first term in office.](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/01/major-correction-will-surprise-market-speculators-cfras-sam-stovall.html)\n* **Fundamentals become increasingly disconnected from price**  \nThe democratization of stocks has lead many niche stocks higher, giving them a rich valuation in comparison to the broader marker. Overall prices seem more disconnected from Earnings across the board. While forward looking P/E has [declined from a high of 39.95 in Q4 '20 to 25.35 for Q4 '21](https://ycharts.com/indicators/sp_500_pe_ratio_forward_estimate#:~:text=S%26P%20500%20P%2FE%20Ratio%20Forward%20Estimate%20is%20at%20a,36.55%25%20from%20one%20year%20ago.) for the S&P 500, time weighted average of consensus estimates of P/E is still close to ATH, according to [Yardeni Research](https://www.yardeni.com/pub/stockmktperatio.pdf). This is mostly attributed to crazy valuations in the Large Cap sector.\n* **Stocks decline on earnings beat**  \nCompanies that beat earnings and revenue expectations are underperforming the broader market by 50 basis points the day after reporting. This indicates that stocks are ultra sensitive to earnings reports. Multiple earning misses, for example due to a pandemic, could lead to a broader market sell-off.  \n* **Goldman's and BoA's indicators are signaling negative sentiment**  \n[Bank of America's sell-side indicator stood at 58.4%](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2021/02/01/heres-what-could-spark-the-next-10-market-correction-bank-of-america-warns/?sh=175bf1ff2120) in January, two points away from indicating a \"sell\" rating for U.S. equities. Similarly, Goldman's risk appetite recently moved above 1, \"[a level that has previously preceded slumps](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-outlook-goldman-sachs-correction-risk-investors-buy-dip-2021-1-1029981958)\". Broadly speaking, investors are underestimating a decline, similar to 2009, according to Goldman. \"The market is rising on good news but choosing to largely ignore weaker data and rising infection rates,\" the team said. \"Rapid fund flows and highly correlated risk assets make a correction in the near term increasingly likely.\" \n* **Multiple similarities to 2000**  \nWhile I am cautious about painting a \"doomsday\" picture, it is important as a investor to accurately assess risk and study historic events to find present day correlations. Although past performances may not be indicative of future results, it always serves as a great guideline for traders and investors alike. We can assess, that current market conditions are pointing to many similarities to the 2000 tech bubble, which screams bearish sentiment for weeks to come. These were some factors that precedented the market sell off in the 2000 tech bubble and are present in the stock market as of right now.  \n\n\n*Increased Risk appetite: ‚úî*   \n*Increasing Retail participation: ‚úî*   \n*Valuations disconnected from fundamentals: ‚úî*  \n*Companies underperform following earnings beat ‚úî* \n\n&#x200B;\n\nGiven the state of the market, the likelihood of a market correction becomes increasingly likely. If a broad-market sell-off will happen, h**ow much will the broader market indices decline?** While this is hard to assess, current market support levels stand at 3,630 and 3,550. representing a 5% and 7% decline from Friday's close. Bank of America analysts predict up to a 13% decline, which happened at the peak of the tech-bubble in 2000. \n\n Lastly, **Robinhood will certify in front of congress on February 19th.** If this will lead to any restrictions on market leverage, for retail investors or institutions a like, it would trigger a unprecedented market sell-off. Similar, rising meme-stocks would force the hand of hedge funds and decrease their long-exposure even more, potentially triggering a decline similar to Thursday and Friday.", "id": "lbx3pu", "created_utc": 1612383470.0, "score": 163, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 83, "comments": [{"body": "You can throw all that dd out the window if they pass the 1.2 trillion$ stimulus", "score": 187, "replies": [{"body": "Yup this guy is thinking about fundamentals.
