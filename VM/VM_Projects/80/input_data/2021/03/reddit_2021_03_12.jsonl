Apple was sort of like Tesla for the first 3-5 years the iPhone was out, nobody had anything even close to it on the market. By the time everyone else caught up Apple was \"the\" phone brand to buy, and they got millions of people hooked on their ecosystem using the iPhone during that period. I think Apple was smart to start Apple TV; they have to do SOMETHING to expand their business elsewhere. The big problem Apple has though is that technology has gotten much cheaper in the past decade. You can buy a high end laptop for a fraction of what an Apple laptop costs and you get close to the same performance. Apple has always been able to charge a super high premium for their products, but that's going to be more and more difficult going forward.
