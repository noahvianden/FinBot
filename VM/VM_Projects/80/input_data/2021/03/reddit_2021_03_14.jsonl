By having an in house insurance product Tesla can better cover these exposures, and I think it will naturally become part of FSD/autonomous taxi rates, 4) it has some cool vertical integration especially since Tesla is closed loop, they can cover the cost of repairs, do it in house and not have body shops marking up unneeded repairs.", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "How do you think the expansion of FSD beta to the public will impact the stock price?
