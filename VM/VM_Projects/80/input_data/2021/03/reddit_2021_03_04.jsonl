But to go a bit deeper...\n\nThe internet was expanding more rapidly than there was content and demand for it... telecommunications companies like MCI (now Verizon) were making absurd infrastructure investments despite the fact that there wasn't a huge driver of bandwidth consumption.  The content simply didn't exist.\n\nLikewise, a lot of web-based revenue models were like this... they were all interesting for ten seconds.  And then what?   There was a guy who satirized this whole phenomenon with the website zombo.com (the site is still around, with slightly \"updated\" graphics).\n\nThe other side of this was rounds of VC funding and the IPO craze... again, my aunt was involved in both, and her company had one of the largest IPO's of the 1990s, only to be bankrupt a year later because, again, while everyone was keen on this OC-192 fiber network, where the hell was the Tier 2 demand going to come from?  iTunes Music Store wouldn't even come into existence until about six years later.\n\nWhat compounded it was the accounting scandals of these telecom infrastructure giants like MCI and Qwest, where they were trying to cover up their mistakes... So it wasn't really the dotcoms.  It was actually infrastructure: Ciena Corp, Juniper Networks, JDS Uniphase, Copper Mountain Technologies, Norstan, Nortel, the list goes on and on and on... \n\nThat's when the real shit hit the fan and institutions started putting two and two together realizing that while the enthusiasm was there, the actual consumer demand wasn't materializing at the same pace because it couldn't.  People had vague notions of the internet fueled by the likes of movies such as LAWNMOWER MAN and JOHNNY MNEMONIC.. so completely removed from the reality of telco's struggling to deliver 256 Kbps speeds more than 15,000 feet from a CO.   \n\nIt wasn't until an online book reseller patented one click purchase that this changed in two ways that are reflected in the market capitalization of two companies: Amazon (the book seller) and Apple.  Apple quietly licensed that patent from Amazon in 2001 and launched the iTunes Music Store in 2003 after CFO Fred Anderson had reorganized and restructured the business and Steve Jobs eliminated 90% of all projects in a single meeting in the fall of 1996, putting them on a focused track of building a product ecosystem around what he called the \"digital hub\".\n\nThe reason computers are the multimedia hubs they are today has everything to do with what took place in that meeting, which also resulted in the immediate firing of about 30 product managers.  But what Amazon and Apple figured out was that the internet's greatest power wasn't VR bullshit or other bandwidth hogs that didn't really exist yet and nobody would know what to do with it if they saw it... it was the convenience of eliminating every middleman in the delivery of consumer staples & consumer discretionary, from underwear to music.  It transformed consumer goods into a high gross margin business, and it completely obliterated distribution models that had been in place since the 1940s.\n\n**EDIT:** Two great reads on this subject:\n\n1.

People think this is going to add substantial long term revenue streams.  That's exceedingly unlikely, because eventually everyone will offer that.  And then the incremental cost to the consumer goes down very quickly and adds little long term value.  There will be a time limited window during which Tesla will be able to derive significant revenue from that.\n\nThat's just one example.\n\nTesla's margin on vehicles hovers around 1%.  Less than that if you factor in the warranty work they try to squirrel out of.  If you assume 30+% unit growth in vehicle sales annually for the next decade, *and* increasing margins, they are *still* dramatically overpriced, today.\n\nIf they sell 10m cars annually, in 10 years time, and margins are at 3%, they will have $18B in gross profit.  And just for reference, global annual vehicle sales are around 65-70m, annually.\n\nApple's gross profit last year was $115B.\n\nThere's literally 10 years worth of *perfect* execution already in the stock price.  Tesla would have a P/E of 30 TEN YEARS from now, at *today's* same market cap, if they do everything *perfectly* and you see that kind of insane growth.\n\nAnd the only thing I really needed to look at to realize that it was *never going to happen* was how long it takes to build and make operational a car factory.  Tesla can't open enough factories quickly enough to meet that growth target, even *if* there were no competition and demand was there.  And that's also not at all a realistic assumption.\n\nThere's one thing that would prop up this valuation: if Musk rolls SpaceX into an umbrella company for a sweetheart deal for Tesla shareholders.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I’m sorry but I’m not seeing anywhere in the 10-k that shows how the vehicles margin is around 1%.

Honestly, when this was at $900, I kept telling people they'd be lucky if Tesla was still at $900 in 2030, much less the $10,000 price targets people kept telling me it was going to.\n\nLoads of comparisons to Amazon, of course, but Amazon never had highly negative free cash flow, and their incremental COGS are better.  People constantly tell me \"Tesla is a tech company\".  Except tech companies generally can sell a lot of tech without having something as expensive and hard to produce as a car attached to it.  FSD doesn't give you anything without a car attached to it.  Nor does the battery tech.  It's all an extremely capital intensive business, and I think that the pie-in-the-sky optimists tend to want to totally overlook that fact.\n\nTesla's stock is loaded to the tits with a bunch of clowns that can't do any financial analysis on their own, and just believe whatever shit Wall St. analysts with their own agenda tell them.\n\nAnyways, I was still early on my short, since my average is somewhere around $710.
