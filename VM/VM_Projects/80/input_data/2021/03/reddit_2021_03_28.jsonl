{"title": "Tiger Cub Archegos Liquidation and Friday’s market action in some of the stocks affected", "selftext": "Several news outlets have reported large block-trades yesterday which caused sudden decline in several stocks. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were reportedly facilitating the block trades. Some outlets are reporting this morning that Tiger Cub Archegos was liquidating due to  margin call .  I overlaid the charts for some of the stocks which declined suddenly around 2pm EST : - $LC, $VIPS,  $FTCH, $DISCA, $IQ,  $GSX, $VIAC  $FUBO.  Other stocks like $BIDU, $TME declined earlier in the day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[March 26 market action at \\~2pm EST](https://preview.redd.it/5xogv7x61op61.png?width=1008&format=png&auto=webp&s=6166cbae88e60775d09cb8385a14439c61a867bf)", "id": "mer0gl", "created_utc": 1616892935.0, "score": 398, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 70, "comments": [{"body": "Someone just doubled their money", "score": 67, "replies": [{"body": "Not doubled.

We may see it but it also may be a profit taking point mentally for many.

I think funds gave been washing out retail from FAANG for the next leg up. I’ve got QCOM and AAPL calls for June and May and I think they’re about to rip. You’ll likely see the reopening names get punished whenever FAANG goes off then them catch up as retail and WSB chase behind the hedge funds.\n\nTo make money you don’t have to be first, but you have to be before many.
