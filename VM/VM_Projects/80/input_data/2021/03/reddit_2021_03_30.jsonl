{"title": "Lets talk about SPACE baby - the next wave of companies ARKX will pick up", "selftext": "By now we have all seen the things Cathy put in her new space exploration ETF from obvious inclusions like KTOS and LHX to head scratchers John Deere to Netflix and her own 3D printing ETF. Obviously the fund is actively managed so new companies will be acquired, reweighted, and blah blah blah. What follows is a few companies I can see being added at some point.\n\n**Northrop Grumman (NOC)** \\- I was admittedly surprised not to see NOC in the holdings for ARKX. They are LMT's little brother who has their own impressive portfolio of government contracts and military vehicles. They have also been making acquisitions to pivot towards Space. In 2017, they bought Orbital ATK and used that to form NG Innovative Systems. With that acquisition, NOC acquired multiple rockets, engines, and Space Payloads. Government contracting is very West Virginia-y and NOC already has existing ties to every defense company in ARKX. Notice, LMT just bought Aero(tyne)jet Rocketdyne to furhter build out their space capabilities. If you look at their earnigns release, NOC grew its Space Systems division 18% from $7.4B to $8.7B from 2019 to year end 2020. Those numbers should continue to grow as the government seeks a number of space capabilities.\n\n**Raytheon (RTX)** \\- Another classic American company connected to the teet of the USG. Raytheon Missiles have been sending people to the Gulag long before it was cool to do in Warzone. Like NOC and LMT, RTX has also made strategic space acquisitions, acquiring small sat company Blue Canyon Technologies in addition to owning Collins Aerospace. In its first year, RTX Intelligence & Space division had $10.8B in net sales and 9.4% profit margin while Collins Aerospace had $19.2B in net sales and a 7.6% operating profit margin. Feels worth noting, Collins Aerospace literally makes fucking [space suits](https://www.collinsaerospace.com/what-we-do/Space/Space-Suits) along with other critical spacecraft components. the Intelligence and Space division will continue to rack up prime contracts with the USG and sub contracts with all the other players in the Space sector and revenues will grow.\n\n**Maxar (MAXR)** \\- This company can best be described as LHX-lite as they have pivoted from a satellite imagery and consulting provider to becoming a company that makes boxes and things that will enter Space. MAXR actually has [some of its tech](https://blog.maxar.com/space-infrastructure/2021/inside-perseverance-how-maxar-robotics-will-enable-a-historic-mars-mission) on the Perseverance Rover exploring Mars right now. Additionally they are providing power and propulsion elements for the NASA Lunar Gateway project. Their 2020 annual hasn't been released yet, but the 2019 report highlighted contract wins and their development of their Space Infrastructure business in the mil/gov space. The company is still finding its way as it [reported a loss](https://investor.maxar.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2021/Maxar-Technologies-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2020-Results/default.aspx) on 1.7B in revenue in 2020.  Growth in the previously mentioned Space Infrastructure division helped pair down the company's overall losses. Its most notable bit of news lately has been the [failure](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/27/sirius-xm-satellite-sxm-7-fails-built-by-maxar-and-launched-by-spacex.html) of it's satellite built for Sirius XM that was launched by SpaceX. If you invested in zero and pre-revenue EV companies, this is the play for you.\n\nThere are additional speculation plays you could make in a number of SPACS with BlackSky, Momentus, and SpaceX junior (Rocket Labs). Not going into further detail cause they have <1B market cap.\n\nI would note that these companies along with the other ones like LHX, LMT, HO, BA, KTOS etc will have big revenues but slimmer profit margins due to the complexities of putting shit into space and government contract restrictions on contract profits so you won't see the large PE ratios of software/tech companies. None of these are get rich quick stonks so patience will be required.\n\n**TL;DR: ARKX has some questionable holdings now. Buy shares of these companies that could see an ARK boost.**\n\nDISCLAIMER: I do not have any ARKX holdings. I work for one of the companies in ARKX on a space systems program.
