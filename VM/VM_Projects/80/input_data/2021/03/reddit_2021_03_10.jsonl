{"title": "Detailed Analysis to Explain What Happened Today. Just Look at Volume.", "selftext": "**TLDR:  $GME Volume during 12:20pm - 12:41pm crash indicates this was either a large  whale sell order (unlikely) or algorithmic short selling (likely). Keep  HOLDING!**\n\nJust like you, I  was stunned, amazed, bewildered, and intrigued as the price of $GME  fell like a falling knife within minutes. As I watched the price  plummet, the relatively low volume that transpired during that cliff  dive didn't make sense to me.\n\nLet's dive in.\n\n[$GME Daily Chart and Volume](https://preview.redd.it/zq8ft5pm4am61.jpg?width=1320&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=57cbbd3d5c04822441a1ffa5c3d3028b473eab5f)\n\nLet's zoom into the drop that started around 12:20 PM.\n\n[Price and Volume Chart in Minute Increments](https://preview.redd.it/bdd39mde4am61.jpg?width=1320&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=35fef4c2488fe6c24abd3fdfdafe91a30d4d913b)\n\nAs  the price dropped, the peak minute volume was 936.7K. From 12:20 PM to  the bottom at 12:41 PM, the total volume traded was 4.32 million shares.  In the grand scheme of things, this is NOT A LOT of volume for such a  violent price move.\n\nThis points to two possibilities in my mind.\n\n**Possibility #1 (Unlikely)**\n\nThe  first possibility is that this was a large sell order by a whale  looking to cash out. This is less likely in my opinion. If an actual  whale was trying to sell out of its position, it would not sell all of  its shares at one time cratering the stock price and inducing halts.  They would trickle in sell orders throughout the day to get out of their  position and maximize profit. This was definitely NOT retail selling,  you could barely even put in a sell order fast enough when this was  dropping.\n\n**Possibility #2 (Likely)**\n\nThe  second possibility is that this was an algorithmic short attack to  induce fear and panic selling. This is more likely in my opinion. If you  look at the total volume during this time-frame along with the rate the  stock was falling, this screams of a deliberate short attack. The  volume throughout the week was not high enough to indicate shorts have  covered. Conversely, there are actually less shares available to short  at the end of the day. According to multiple websites, there are now  only 150,000 shares available to short.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn  conclusion, this was most likely an algorithmic short attack from  12:20pm to 12:41pm. GME's thesis has not changed. A gamma squeeze is  also a likely possibility tomorrow through Friday. I believe GME is  restricted to short on upticks only (SSR) till tomorrow so it should be  an exciting Thursday. Keep holding and remember...
