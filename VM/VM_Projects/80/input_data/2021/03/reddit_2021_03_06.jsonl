{"title": "The Tesla Bear Case", "selftext": "I’d like to share with everyone my Tesla bear thesis. I share this because I’ve seen lots of misinformation lately, and IMO, the bear case is not as bad as people think. \n\nI’d like to start by recognizing the good things about Tesla. Tesla is the global leader in battery technology, vehicle software, supercharger network, and full self driving. Traditional automakers are so far behind Tesla that they don’t provide meaningful competition. As of today, I don’t believe Tesla is overvalued at its current price, $597.95. But it’s expensive. I believe in the company, but as someone with a 3-5 year time horizon I’m not buying it’s stock. I believe the downside risk is still big while the upside is limited. Here’s why. \n\n1. Execution risk. Tesla has a lot on its plate, from rapid expansion of manufacturing/logistics, R&D costs for full self driving and world-best battery tech, new vehicle development, and doing something productive with a solar business which is dragging on the company. Not meeting lofty expectations in any of these will drag on the stock price.\n\n2. Competition. I’m not worried about traditional car companies or upstart EV companies. What I’m worried about is Apple with iCar and Google with full self-driving. Apple is dangerous not because of car expertise, but because of their tech savvy and brand loyalty. Their competition is several years down the road, but very dangerous. And in case you were unaware, Google’s subsidiary Waymo which is considered the leader in autonomous driving tech is reportedly valued at $30 billion. Both Apple and Google can seriously jeopardize Tesla’s dominance in the EV market.\n\n3. Elon Musk. Tesla’s stock price is largely a bet on the vision and drive of Elon Musk. However, Elon Musk has suggested in the past his goal with Tesla was to get the world to switch to EVs. Now it seems he’s succeeding in that, and if he steps down as CEO and focuses on his primary interests, space and hyperloop, I believe we will see a prolonged bear market in Tesla stock. \n\nI love Tesla as a company and I hope they prove me wrong. And I’d like to mention, even if my bear case plays out, Tesla will still be one of the most valuable companies in the world. But I wouldn’t be surprised if the stock price still hovers around $600 in 5 years (still a $573.9 billion market cap). \n\nLet’s hear what everyone else thinks, and please correct me if I’m wrong about anything.

{"title": "Comparing institutional ownership for popular companies to GME: GME IS AN OUTLIER.", "selftext": "**B**y popular demand, I figured I'd pull screenshots of nine popular companies so we can see what's up. Many of you asked yesterday how GME compares to other companies, and some stated that it didn't matter what the numbers showed due to reporting delays.\n\n**U**nderstandably, in terms of reporting delays, yes, institutions report on their own schedules. HOWEVER, Bloomberg's and S&P's data is as up-to-date as possible in terms of pulling the available filings. They wouldn't be such expensive products if they didn't have the best data available.\n\n**Y**ou may believe that reporting delays affect the ownership for one stock (i.e. GME's higher ownership due to reporting delays shouldn't matter), so another thing I want to point out regarding reporting delays is that, to be consistent, you'd have believe that all other companies suffer the same reporting delay issue.\n\n**G**enerally, this is what makes a comparison of GME to other public companies reasonable: if institutions can report on a delayed fashion for one company, they'd likely do it for all companies. Therefore, we should be able to compare current ownership numbers with reasonable confidence.\n\n**M**oving on to the screenshots. Look at the \"Curr\" column on the Bloomberg screenshots - this will show you the numbers for today's date. The \"02/28/21\" column shows numbers as of 02/28/2021. The \"Change\" column shows how the numbers have changed from 02/28/2021 to today's date.\n\n**E**ach individual should make his or her own conclusions, but you can see that, when compared to nine popular tickers, GME is an outlier.\n\nThis isn't financial advice, and you bet your ass I'm holding to the moon. 🚀💎🤲🏼\n\n[GME Bloomberg](https://preview.redd.it/atmbwd0f7gl61.png?width=2738&format=png&auto=webp&s=87a692301ba283e5bee18ce0111491c20be030de)\n\n[GME S&P](https://preview.redd.it/0dsz8c0f7gl61.png?width=2844&format=png&auto=webp&s=f031b6527639eb2b6297ca638272aa835082e52d)\n\n[Apple Bloomberg](https://preview.redd.it/ms0q72v87gl61.png?width=2744&format=png&auto=webp&s=1771653f3ba4b02cb96c3609ee9d49cf26d0ef2d)\n\n[Apple S&P](https://preview.redd.it/c5g5z2v87gl61.png?width=2868&format=png&auto=webp&s=dbe1df161cddf56c37b0297527c896d56c6877d1)\n\n[Amazon Bloomberg](https://preview.redd.it/5tqmmne97gl61.png?width=2734&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6fa09bd5db4aa0dbccb6fea919461c85075692d)\n\n[Amazon S&P](https://preview.redd.it/r33bape97gl61.png?width=2844&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e104d91b48938ac5bfd5c165c17cd31dc2e1859)\n\n[Microsoft Bloomberg](https://preview.redd.it/d17rv8z97gl61.png?width=2744&format=png&auto=webp&s=9075fb8198210ddc6e59c5f27f0d4f68cf234adf)\n\n[Microsoft S&P](https://preview.redd.it/b9qffaz97gl61.png?width=2858&format=png&auto=webp&s=6dd6f5e8f454c52e1925f38549d4ea07a5889ba8)\n\n[Google Bloomberg](https://preview.redd.it/1nv0x38b7gl61.png?width=2734&format=png&auto=webp&s=d836711b35166729244b6327818ffe9fa108eccb)\n\n[Google S&P](https://preview.redd.it/nvvy8a8b7gl61.png?width=2848&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4b8c0f03c7e0223edf99b255f9e2e6000db1fcc)\n\n[Tesla Bloomberg](https://preview.redd.it/mw00symb7gl61.png?width=2736&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e9fcc51eade8235f855517a6f902624ea2618d0)\n\n[Tesla S&P](https://preview.redd.it/ggddnzmb7gl61.png?width=2854&format=png&auto=webp&s=6ac74fdd9365a1afca19c44fa1af6c698d84063a)\n\n[Movie theater Bloomberg](https://preview.redd.it/bb0fz15c7gl61.png?width=2740&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd7f583e573969db6436d9dc6eb4a3051cef4240)\n\n[Movie theater S&P](https://preview.redd.it/i986935c7gl61.png?width=2850&format=png&auto=webp&s=aeef47b2c171a8a24ec57431f73c71bb1c116fa1)\n\n[Palantir Bloomberg](https://preview.redd.it/w4knrimc7gl61.png?width=2732&format=png&auto=webp&s=87c56ece8122d6eca48ed883fec891cf20af5296)\n\n[Palantir S&P](https://preview.redd.it/a09rekmc7gl61.png?width=2840&format=png&auto=webp&s=c14b432bad7ea8f6912c6d1067cc4f5ee2c25d53)\n\n[BlackBerry Bloomberg](https://preview.redd.it/ic6hws1d7gl61.png?width=2738&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b706220aab104a7a23c3de925fa32cc116b2c95)\n\n[BlackBerry S&P](https://preview.redd.it/fwxkso1d7gl61.png?width=2840&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f7662452fbd6ce7340a50cab588a5315f9e4c4f)\n\n[Rocket Bloomberg](https://preview.redd.it/yacqpvjd7gl61.png?width=2728&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ab1648fba70ab7371dfc4658bebe4ffce34fd70)\n\n[Rocket S&P](https://preview.redd.it/t009aqjd7gl61.png?width=2846&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf8d5ddda8e5426c8ffcf744ea7f472c545e5051)", "id": "lz7e2d", "created_utc": 1615054220.0, "score": 429, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 80, "comments": [{"body": "So institutions own 94.76% of the entire float.
