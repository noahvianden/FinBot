I believe they've already started, but I'm undecided as yet, as to how gyms in general would respond to adopting Pelotons. What do you think?\n\nOn the one hand, it may save them some overhead in paying for their own fitness instructors and classes, but on the other, it could have the disadvantage of taking those \"lazy\" customers you mentioned from the gym altogether if they decide it's easier just to buy and use Peloton at home. \n\nHowever, I think there would still be a niche for gyms to provide the future full selection of Peloton machines which most people won't be able to afford at home.

If PTON wasn't already aimed at the high-income sector I'd be bearish on it in that regard, but instead I'm of the belief that its high prices and cult-like brand are what is giving it the edge over many of its competitors post-pandemic. \n\nAlthough I think at-home fitness will continue to increase since it's more convenient (as well as the fact remote working has been given a boost by the pandemic), it makes sense that it will slow. However, I think people with higher incomes are going to be putting their convenience first because they can afford to do so, and the fact that PTON is focusing on the commercial sector unlike most of its competitors gives it some real potential.\n\nThe uncertainties for me are 1) The high-income market is limited, and 2) Will they be able to dominate gyms?\n\nLike you, I'm not entirely sure about gyms.

It's fine for the high-income market, but if they plan to also get more of the middle and lower-income markets in future, charging $39.99/month to people who buy the equipment vs. charging only $12.99 to those without the equipment seems pretty silly since it won't encourage those outside of the high-income sector to purchase their equipment.

I never went to a gym. I bought a variant of Peloton by another company, but it broke (a LOT of home gym equipment is terribly made, but most people do not notice because it becomes a clothes hanger), and then I just decided to bite the price bullet and get the Peloton.\n\nMy husband and I hate exercising; we never used our gym memberships; I even tried personal training to get me motivated and I fell off the wagon after three weeks. Now we look forward to getting on this bike. We don't even care about the individual instructors at all, but the tablet with a plethora of classes is great. Peloton is the Apple of exercise machines.\n\nAnd, most importantly, Peloton managed to successfully gamify exercise and this helped people who don't like to exercise actually want to do it. This helps avoid the \"fad effect\" that the personal trainer mentioned here in the threads (even though I understand that he has clients who abandoned the bike - but that is a VERY self-selected group of people because they did abandon the bike and go back to the gym. I do not think that's the sign of the fad; they are just not right for Peloton as I'm not right for the gym. Also, I did HATE Peloton during my first 8 rides until I had a breakthrough (learning how to click out, use the bike, get used to the seat, find the right instructor), so perhaps they did not persist.\n\nI don't know about the effect the competitors can have, but when I find a product I love, I'm not too interested in trying out some bike on which I have to tape the tablet to save money or - as much as I love Apple and am typing on their latest macpro - I'm simply not interested in finding a better home machine because I already feel that what I got is more than I could have ever expected.
