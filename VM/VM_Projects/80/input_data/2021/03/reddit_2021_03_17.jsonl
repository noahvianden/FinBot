{"title": "Need help understanding selling CC's - sounds too good to be true.", "selftext": "So I've been looking into selling covered calls, and my understanding of it makes it sounds extremely profitable for such a low risk that I think there must be some kind of fundamental mistake in my understanding, because when something sounds too good to be true, it normally is. I've known about selling CC's for a while, but I saw in a thread on WSB that someone sold just 2 11/19 800C's on GME for $20,000, and this piqued my interest as I didn't realise it could be this profitable. Of course, GME is a very volatile stock so options contracts will have a larger premium, and this comes with the downside of you needing to hold a volatile stock until November. But when I run the numbers on my head on a more stable stock, it still seems sounds like by far the best investment strategy, and it makes me wonder why everyone isn't doing it.\n\nSay for example, you buy 100 apple shares for $125, for a total investment of $12,500. According to yahoo finance, right now a 3/26 $130C goes for 0.94, x100 that's $94. Obviously the stock has a reasonably high chance of hitting that price, but even if it does you're still keeping the premium plus $500 gains from the stock moving up $5, so you wouldn't be too unhappy. But let's say it does hit the strike price, you can just sell your stock, buy back in at the new higher price, and repeat your strategy. It seems to me like you could be making at least $70 a week in premiums off just a $12,500 investment, x52 weeks a year thats $3640, more than a 25% annual ROI with the only downside being that you have to hold 100 apple stock, which could potentially fall, or potentially rise more than 25%. Is this really how it works? Is there something I'm not considering?", "id": "m6wd4h", "created_utc": 1615972650.0, "score": 24, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 83, "comments": [{"body": "Welcome to r/stocks!\n\nFor beginner advice, brokerage info, book recommendations, even advanced topics and more, please read our [Wiki here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index)\n\nIf you're wondering **why a stock moved** a certain way, check out [Finviz](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=spy) which aggregates the most news for almost every stock, but also see [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/), and even [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/).\n\nPlease direct all simple questions towards the stickied Daily Discussion and Quarterly Rate My Portfolio threads (sort by Hot, they're at the top).\n\nAlso include *some* [due diligence](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/duediligence.asp) to this post or it may be removed if it's low effort.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If it ends ITM but you don’t want to sell your shares, you can buy it back close to expiration day for about the difference between market and strike.

Why? 2 Reasons:\n\nFirst, under normal circumstances, a call will never get exercised before expiration. Why? It just doesn’t make sense. To put it super simple, as long as there’s time left, that time is worth something. If you own a call with a week left, strike at 50 and an underlying at 60, why would you buy the stock now? The strike price is fixed. It is certain that you can buy it in a week at 50, no matter if it rises to 70, 100 or 1,000. Buying it right now would only open you up to the risk of it falling between now and expiration. If you want to realize your gains right now, you can sell the call for the difference between strike and market (10 in my example) and even some payment for that time (the premium). \n\nThe second reason is that, mathematically, there is no difference between a call getting exercised or you rolling it. If you roll a call, you first have to buy it back. That’ll cost you pretty much exactly the difference between strike and market. The same amount you would lose (by missing out on it) if your shares get sold below market. To go back to the example, you can prevent the call from getting exercised by buying it back for 10, so you keep all your shares that are now worth 60. Or you let them get called away, get 50 for each, and buy them back at 60, paying 10 more than you got. Either way, no real difference (besides tax reasons in many cases). Then you sell the next call. That’s what rolling is, in very simple terms.

The premium is also dependent on how volatile the stock price is, if the stock is **too** stable, then the premium is also going to be really low. Using your AAPL example, let's say you buy 100 shares for $125 and sell a 3/26 130C for $0.94:\n\n1. If the price of AAPL shoots up to $150 at expiration, you're forced to sell at $130, giving up an additional $20/share = $2000.\n\n2. If the price of AAPL drops to $105, you keep the $94 premium, but you lose $20/share = $2000. The +$94 is going to seem like nothing next to the -$2000.\n\n3. Realistically, you're looking at a 10-20% return/year selling options, which sounds pretty nice but you also have to actively manage it. Some ETFs can return that much or more, and all you have to do is buy and hold and check it once a month.\n\n4.

{"title": "No GaME in C3.AI: price target $42", "selftext": "**TLDR: Short C3.AI!** **Price target $42.0. $AI is gonna crash 50% back to IPO price after FY’21 earnings. Here's the opportunity to make some 🍗🍗 today: I bought OTM Apr16 puts at $75 strike and July16 puts at $55 strike. Expecting 113% return on the April puts when the stock crashes to $65. Expecting 210% return on the July puts once the stock craters to 42. Why? Because C3 is the epitome of “the Establishment trying to tech”: an energy consulting company pretending to be AI SaaS so that investors can ratchet its shares 500% higher than fair value and then dump at the expense of the little guys. Despite sluggish top-line growth, dismal economies of scale, and penetration headwind into “new-world” customers, C3 is still currently trading at 50x P/S (price to sales). Tom Siebel, the filthy-rich CEO, already PumpedNdumped $200M of his shares last week, so we apes need to band together now to \"PUT\" this out before institutions sneak it into our retirement index funds.**\n\nWant more details? Read on.\n\n\\-----\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[$AI slipped 10&#37; last 2 weeks and there's SO MUCH MORE TO FALL!](https://preview.redd.it/d7he7mm9vmn61.jpg?width=961&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=627b96b5f1e9fbd4cc1cf2f7b6417100ab157926)\n\nAfter looking into it for 20 min, my OpenAI friend put it best:\n\n    “Holy sh*t girl, this is seriously just the Establishment pretending to tech!!”\n\nBut before digging into the details of this farce—sorry, ~~SaaS~~ company, let me first give a shout out to u/indonesian_activist, u/BenjaminFernwood, and everyone else who supported me and my options analytics tool (which I will make available to all you 🦍🦍🦍 ASAP so you can visualize real-time implied price probabilities on any ticker of your choice at any time! Keep tabs on that GME!!!) Your upvotes have enabled this ex-hedgie quant girl to make her first ever DD post 😃😃 (aka this one).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Now let’s break down why you should sell** **C3.AI** **from 3 supporting perspectives:**\n\n**(1)\tThe fundamentals perspective**\n\n**(2)\tThe quant perspective (where we'll look at 2 specific good-looking options trades to put on)**\n\n**(3)\tThe apes-vs-hedgies perspective**\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**(1)  The fundamentalist argument:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Terrible revenue growth:** C3.ai IPO’ed on Dec. 8, 2020, and reported its first quarterly (Q3) earnings on Mar 1, 2020. Stock plunged >30% that week, from $120 to $85. What happened?! Growth numbers sucked. Top line was basically flat to decreasing throughout COVID (\\~1% QoQ in April 2020, -2% in July, +2% in Oct). Clearly nobody had the frivolous time to listen to Tom Siebel’s buzzwordy service offerings in a down economy. Then finally on March 1, after riding the coattails of IPO hype, the company finally reported 19% QoQ growth. But nobody was impressed because that’s still too damn shabby to justify a valuation more than 65x TTM revenue.\n* **Overblown multiple:** Today, even after sliding 30%, C3 is still valued at \\~51x price to revenue, which is insane! For reference, comparable B2B AI/ data analytics companies (aka consulting services and abstraction layers on top of Hadoop & Tensorflow) are only 10x-15x at best:\n\nAlteryx: 11.7x (23% QoQ growth in most recent quarter)\n\nSumo Logic: 11.2x (30% YoY growth)\n\nCloudera: <5x (12% YoY growth)\n\n* The only other similarly valued comparable is Palantir at \\~44x. Bulls (aka Wall Street’s sycophantic sell side analysts) may use PLTR as a lame justification for C3’s current valuations, but unlike C3 Palantir is actually looking at real 45% QoQ revenue growth—more than DOUBLE that of C3’s, even while maintaining a 700% bigger denominator (PLTR’s annual recurring revenue is \\~$1.4B)! Comparing C3 to PLTR is like comparing your wife's boyfriend to Emma Watson!!\n* **Enormous customer concentration and churn risk**: C3’s top 3 customers accounted for 44% of total revenue in 2020 and the top 2 accounted for 36%. Imagine if one of those contracts churned. Then what? Oh, and in case you were wondering who those lucky titans are: Baker Hughes and Engie. Any value C3 provides these oil moguls just goes toward accelerating global pollution. In fact, in 2020 59% of sales came from the oil and gas industry! Just lovely. I really want to meet the biz dev genius who said “let’s go after the most capex intensive customers, cuz they surely gots the free cash flows to be loose with their wallets!” Uncle Siebel seemed to realize this gaffe only once he decided to go public. Now C3 is chasing after “high tech,” trying desperately to compete against Palantir/ Databricks/AWS and a cornucopia of other startups, including open source and in-house teams. Too late. Meanwhile it also changed its name TWICE from C3 Energy to C3.IoT to C3.AI… Still think this is an “AI” company? ‘Nuf said.\n* **Even the Chief is bearish!** As soon as his 90-day post-IPO lockup expired on March 8, Siebel dumped 2.26 million shares! (See the SEC filing table below). Now just how big was this big dump? To give y’all some perspective, during the IPO in December, C3 sold just 15.5 million shares, so Siebel single-handedly increased the supply by 15%!!! How the F did he push all those shares through the dark pools? Oh, and he got to increase his net worth by $200M in the process. Not that he needed such pennies when he was already worth over $3.6B in 2018 from Oracle. Meanwhile, TPG reacted like “Huh? CEO and Chief Engineers taking big dumps? Ima 💩 💩 along with them!”\n\n[Tom Siebel causally cashing out $200M: \\\\\"look at my successful PumpNdump!\\\\\"](https://preview.redd.it/lsrtzivovmn61.png?width=898&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b3c6e1ce738609e29aeca72a2d70732b729ad96)\n\nBut wait, there’s more to rip on Siebel and his management, um, skills…? During the Q3 earnings call, an analyst from Morgan Stanley named Peggy asked for the customer conversion rate (literally the second most important KPIs of any enterprise SaaS company, after revenue growth rate!!). And what did the Chief have to say?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/111uu0c1wmn61.png?width=560&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d0803dbeb233231a08b6f4534573659d9938aca\n\n[direct quote from Q3 earnings](https://preview.redd.it/980lktq2wmn61.png?width=579&format=png&auto=webp&s=c2c0ef5d59203bd59d60dbc24605a14270bcf535)\n\n* **Hasn't EVERYONE figured out by now this is a CONSULTING COMPANY??** What’s the big deal, you ask? What’s wrong with consulting? In case you’re not familiar with post-2010 Silicon Valley tropes, consulting => scalability no-go. When a company needs to build a custom “product” for each new customer it onboards, it can only grow linearly with the number of TAMs and FDEs (forward-deployed solution engineers, aka consultants) it hires. In other words, ain’t no tendies to be made from operating leverage, ain’t no economies of scale, and ain’t no margin improvements to be expected down the pipeline. So how did C3 come to trade at higher-than-SaaS multiples? Easy. Tom Siebel is a veteran at the infinite “Hot Potato” game: where at each funding round, VCs just keep betting that the next round will bring in new money even more willing to jack up valuation stakes until finally the pyramid peaks at the expense of … yep, you guessed it: public market retail investors (aka you, me, and the institutions managing our retirement plans). What does Siebel have to say about all this? “I mean we are focused on being a software company. We're not focused on being a software services company...\" Ok look, no real software company says they're focused on being one; they just are. (If you want even more cringeworthy Siebel quotes, just read the full earnings call transcript. And in case you wanted even more proof that C3 is a downright services business, just open up Linkedin. As of March 15, there are 603 profiles currently working at C3.AI: 195 (32%) turn up under the title “forward deployed engineer,” 166 (28%) turn up under the title “product manager,” and 188 (20%) turn up under the title “solution engineer.” In other words, 80% of the company is pre-or post- sale consultants.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**(2) The quant perspective (get ready for some stats):**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat’s right, this “female ex-hedgie quant” is back with her options visualizations. This time I promise to provide more explanations.\n\nLet’s start with a simplified thought experiment that illustrates what’s going on with $AI. It’s March 16. 3 days before the nearest expiry. Current spot is $86.50. Say you ask 10 apes to set a price target for $AI on Mar 19. Assume 3 of the apes reply $75, 4 reply $80, 2 reply $105 and 1 replies $110. Mean estimate is therefore $86.50 (3\\*$75 + 4\\*$80 + 2\\*$105 + 1\\*$110)/10, which must necessarily equal the current spot price – by definition, spot is the market expected value at any given moment. However, the mode from the 10 responses is $80, which is significantly less than mean; in other words, $80 is the maximum likelihood price target for Mar 19. So which is “more correct”? $86.5 or $80? And what explains the divergence?\n\nIf you think the “outliers” here ($110, maybe $105) are just foolishly off and believe they’ll correct their views over the coming 3 days down to $90 or $95, then you should believe $80 is more correct. However if you think there truly is disproportionate risk to the upside in price movements for the next 3 days, then you should believe $86.50 to be more correct.\n\nThis simplified thought experiment paints a decent picture of what’s currently going on with $AI in the real markets. See graph below showing the price target estimates set by all active options traders (aka the implied probability distribution curve). While no options trader literally said “I think $AI will trade at X,” X can be solved-for mathematically for each transaction based on the purchase/sale price of the options contract and a method called Breeden-Litzenberger. If you want more details on the math, just DM me.\n\nOn the three closest expiry dates, the market assumes there is disproportionately higher downside risk in price movement. You can tell based on the skewed-right shape of the probability distribution curve (i.e. the peak a.k.a. “maximum likelihood estimate” is to the left of spot shown by the dotted line meaning most folks would set their price target below $86.19). So both fundamentals and quants agree that the stock has more to fall.\n\n[buy puts in the \\\\\"A\\\\\" and \\\\\"B\\\\\" range](https://preview.redd.it/eywi6y48wmn61.png?width=969&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd5bc31a2055fd196e7eeeecf2c36193b30182c7)\n\nNow most importantly, where are there good trading opportunities??? How much 🍗🍗 can I expect to make?\n\n* One play is to buy some close OTM April 16 puts if you think $AI has more to drop in the next month. Take a look at where I circled “A” on the graph.\n* If you expect AI to hit 65 before expiry, you can buy the 75 strike puts (at $4.70 as of writing), and **realize an ROI of 530/470=113%.**\n* Alternatively you can buy the 70 strike puts (at $3.10 as of writing) and realize an **ROI of 190/310=61%**\n* Next, look at the pair of puts labeled “B”  for July 16 (one at  50 strike and one at 55). Remember how there’s the annual FY21 earnings release in May!?! If the entire Street hasn't awakened to their senses yet, this will be the catalyst. If $AI drops to $42 by mid-May and you buy the 55-strike puts today ($4.20 as of writing), you're looking at **an ROI of 880/420=210%!**\n* Group \"C\" is overpriced. Don't buy those ITM puts!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(3) The \"apes vs. wall street\" argument\n\nThirdly and lastly, I present the “us vs. the Street” perspective. Take a look at who’s currently long C3, ranked by % ownership from top to bottom. The story goes like this: growth equity investors (like TPG) get “first dibs” at some valuation, pass the hot potato to banks and “fast money” hedgies (like Tiger and Tudor) during IPO at some much higher valuation (where high net worth individuals get “second dibs”), who then pass the hot potato weeks or months later to “real money” pension/mutual funds at even higher valuation (where apes like us keep our retirement plans… so we get “third dibs”). But third dibs is last dibs; it’s a burden not a privilege. Because by that point, when the music stops, we apes get stuck with these overvalued tubers and there’s nobody lower down the totem pole to dump them onto.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/enfthgxcwmn61.png?width=684&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfb686f4f5a9026f503b36c92d6ab833a38a12c1\n\nIn case you thought you had no exposure to C3, think again! Do you own VTS? Does your 401(k) plan own it? Do you own small-cap indices? Mutual funds and ETFs are where bad stonks get swept under the rug to hide amongst the good ones because most retail investors don’t know or don’t care enough to actually look at the full list of holdings!\n\n🦍🦍Unite, we apes gotta work together to cancel out all the bad stonks we're passively owning!! PUT 'em out!\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Options Visualizer Tool is now hosted!

What does Siebel have to say about all this? “I mean we are focused on being a software company. We're not focused on being a software services company...\" Ok look, no real software company says they're focused on being one; they just are. (If you want even more cringeworthy Siebel quotes, just read the full earnings call transcript. And in case you wanted even more proof that C3 is a downright services business, just open up Linkedin. As of March 15, there are 603 profiles currently working at C3.AI: 195 (32%) turn up under the title “forward deployed engineer,” 166 (28%) turn up under the title “product manager,” and 188 (20%) turn up under the title “solution engineer.” In other words, 80% of the company is pre-or post- sale consultants.\n\nThis paragraph right here tells me you have no idea what you’re talking about when it comes to enterprise-grade technology commercial arrangements, which then casts the validity of your entire post into doubt.\n\nMicrosoft, Google, Amazon, Tesla (non-automotive Energy), Oracle, Salesforce, HP, SAP, ADP, Siemens, etc. all have consultative teams in place designed to promote the sale of their product platforms to enterprise-grade clients. Do you think that large companies simply buy some off the shelf version of Azure/AWS and magically integrate it into their existing IT/OT environment? \n\nAbsolutely not - they have teams of consultative experts (Solution Architects, SMEs, Project Developers, Product/ Project Implementation Leads, et al) that work consultatively with enterprise and government clients to develop bespoke systems that fit into their clients existing IT/OT environments - or develop specific capabilities - to meet their clients’ needs. These people are highly compensated experts to the tune of $100-250k+ per year. Do you think the US governmental agencies you listed are buying consumer-grade off-the-shelf commercial products to meet their unique IT needs? Fucking lol.\n\nThe biggest difference between the majority of these companies and c3 is that they have standard off-the-shelf consumer-grade products that are the same for everyone that buys them *in addition to* their enterprise solutions. Think more along the lines of Microsoft Excel, and not a custom Azure deployment for a local municipal government. Can a sophisticated user develop their own AWS/Azure/whatever environment for themselves? Sure, but most enterprise clients can’t do this entirely on their own and rely on those professional services teams at those tech companies to fill the gaps in their capabilities.\n\nYou seem to imply that this lack of off-the-shelf consumer product is a signal that this is a consulting company without a product. I hate to break it to you, but if you took the enterprise-focused groups at those technology firms above away from their parent company, they wouldn’t look all that different from C3 - and they wouldn’t be any less profitable. Having both types of capabilities is obviously great and diversifies things, but focusing on just one of enterprise vs. retail consumer vs. government isn’t a dealbreaker.\n\nThis company might be a clusterfuck for any other number of reasons, but not the ones you listed. You seem to be more of a PLTR fan girl (maybe an employee?) trying to discredit a competitor with sketchy claims than someone providing proper DD.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Holy shit.
