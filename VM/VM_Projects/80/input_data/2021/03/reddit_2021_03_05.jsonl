Players purchase Robux directly for prices ranging from $4.99 to $99.99. Players can spend Robux on game-specific purchases that goes to the Creators with a 30% fee taken out.\n\nCreators can exchange Robux for USD at a current rate $350 per 100,000 Robux as of March 4, 2020. To purchase 100,000 Robux would require 10 purchases of the $99.99 package (10k Robux each) for a total of $999.90.\n\nRoblox also offers three subscription tiers ranging from $4.99 to $19.99 a month, which earns a player Robux and Exclusive store items.\n\nMerchandise plays a role in revenue generation as well. Roblox offers clothing, figurines and gift cards which can be purchased online and in person from places like Amazon, Walmart, GameStop, and Target.\n\n# Growth Potential and Catalyst\n\nThe current outlook for Roblox to grow is promising. There are active investments being made in expanding the age range, international reach, monetization, and technical capabilities of the platform. By continuing to employ modern technology to improve the platform, higher quality experiences and content that appeals to older age demographics can be created.\n\nCurrent international markets for Roblox include US, Canada, and the United Kingdom. Roblox is actively investing in technology that they hope will enhance their growth around the world. For example, they hope to use automated translation and built-in regional compliance tools to help scale into other global markets.\n\nMonetization is another key component to Roblox growing. Recently Roblox Premium which offers a monthly subscription service to its users was added. Roblox actively works with its creator and developer community to help bring them improve their monetization, which in turn increases Roblox‚Äôs monetization. Roblox expects to work with leading brands to build unique marketing opportunities to the platform.\n\n# Competitors and Differences\n\nOne of the things to keep in mind about Roblox itself is not a game, but a gaming platform and ecosystem of multiple gaming experiences. Over 18 million games can be launched from their website and played through a downloaded app on the user‚Äôs computer. Each game can be completely unique from every other game.\n\nRoblox as a platform would more closely related to that of Steam (by Valve) or Epic Games Launcher (by Epic) or Origin (by EA). However, instead of purchasing games through this, a user simply launches whichever one of these free experiences they want at any time. There is no purchasing of the game like there is on the other mentioned platforms.\n\nRoblox‚Äôs main difference is they use the underlying tools to create Roblox specific games utilizing their Software Development Kit (SDK). Other games launched on Steam or Epic are much more loosely connected to the platforms distributing it, whereas Roblox games are highly connected to the Roblox platform in general. The barrier of entry to create a Roblox gaming experience is much less difficult than to create a game to release on other distribution platforms, however the games themselves are ‚ÄúRoblox-centric‚Äù and have common styling, controls, and gaming mechanisms.\n\nRoblox does not charge for the games themselves, but a user buys virtual items and enhancements through their virtual currency called Robux (See ‚ÄúRevenue Generation‚Äù). A user can also be a Roblox Creator who can create virtual items that will appear on their character in all games. They can also create their own Roblox experiences and sell items unique to that game on their own store for Robux. Robux can then be turned into real money (100k Robux -> $350 USD) if the creator wishes to cash out, or they can spend it for themselves within Roblox.\n\n# The User Experience and YouTube Scene\n\nWhen a Roblox player wants to play a game, they navigate to the Roblox website and login. This allows them to browse a list of games and launch the experience within a downloaded application on their computer called the Roblox Player.\n\nUsers on the website can change their avatar and browse the shop for various items such as gear, emotes, characters, and other customizations. Players can connect with their friends or join 1 or more groups of other players to form smaller communities to play together.\n\nRoblox is massive in the YouTube scene. The official Roblox channel has \\~2.9 Million Subscribers. Some YouTube creators attempt to create their own content and promote it on their channel to earn Robux, which they can then exchange for real-life cash.\n\nRoblox can appeal to different age groups for different reasons. While younger age-groups are the ones playing the game, older age-groups are finding ways to make tons of money as developers and creators.\n\n*In 2020, Roblox was the second most watched game on YouTube (second only to Minecraft)*\n\n# Conclusion\n\nBeing relatively new to trading and this being my first due-diligence for a company, I hesitate to make any sort of predictions personally on where this price will go up or down. My gut tells me the $45 price doesn't feel over or under valued, but I think Roblox has a lot of growth potential over the next year.\n\n**Again, you should NOT take any of this as sound financial advice. I am very new to this.**\n\nI do welcome all criticisms and feedback you have to offer. Tell me what's good, bad and missing from this DD!\n\n**EDITS**\n\n* **March 5, 2021 @ 6:40pm CT**\n   * Fixed Typos\n   * Added \"Competitors and Differences\" section", "id": "lym9kc", "created_utc": 1614979431.0, "score": 163, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 90, "comments": [{"body": "Just to add/clarify it is going public via DPO and not the IPO route.\n\nhttps://capital.com/roblox-ipo-is-this-gaming-platform-a-good-fit-for-your-portfolio", "score": 30, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for this!
