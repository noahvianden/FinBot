Be warned, I may be getting a bit greedy here after yesterday, but everyone wanted to know if I was jumping back in. \n\nThe plan is to hold through Tuesday. I kind of paper handed the last one so now I‚Äôm holding strong on this. Check my DD yesterday for why this stock is overvalued af and the crash to 30 has most likely started.\n\nEdit 1: already up huge, for anyone wondering if they can still make money of this HELL YES.
