(AMD) is an American multinational semiconductor company based in Santa Clara, California, that develops computer processors and related technologies for business and consumer markets. While it initially manufactured its own processors, the company later outsourced its manufacturing, a practice known as going fabless, after GlobalFoundries was spun off in 2009. AMD's main products include microprocessors, motherboard chipsets, embedded processors and graphics processors for servers, workstations, personal computers and embedded system applications.", "id": "mbkgir", "created_utc": 1616521975.0, "score": 73, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 86, "comments": [{"body": "I bought at $91 so I sure fucking hope so.", "score": 85, "replies": [{"body": "Me too buddy.
