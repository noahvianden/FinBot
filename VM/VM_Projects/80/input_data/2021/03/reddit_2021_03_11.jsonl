{"title": "NIO testing 200MA, threat of falling through to October support levels", "selftext": "NIO is at a very interesting and dangerous inflection point right now. It just bounced off the 200EMA at $34, and it making its way up to the 50MA at $53. There's a big gap between those prices, and NIO could bounce around between $40 and $44 before deciding which way to go.\n\nThere are bull and bear cases for NIO in the short term. They have announced recent strong partnerships with manufacturing companies and are building more factories to expand their deliveries. They also are releasing new vehicles and have announced tech partnerships for autonomous driving.  But they are affected by the chip shortage that is ravaging the auto market. And they are also facing tremendous competition in China and abroad from TSLA and VOW for their mid-size SUVs.\n\nIf you're holding NIO, it would be a good time to start hedging. Either selling covered calls at 0.25 delta (around $53) or buying long dated puts. I would suggest $30 puts for May 21 which are sitting at $2.00 right now. Paying $200 for downside protection given that NIO may fall to $28 which is the October support level below the 200MA is a reasonable ask. If it does fall, I suspect NIO will fall hard and fast, allowing the PUT to help absorb some of the loss potential.\n\nAnyways, this is just some cautious advice given some warning signs that are flashing. I think NIO is a winner long term, but 2021 may be a tough year where the gains made in 2020 may level out and even recede until more reliable results are provided by NIO.", "id": "m2g3ub", "created_utc": 1615430985.0, "score": 68, "upvote_ratio": 0.72, "num_comments": 85, "comments": [{"body": "This is nonsense.

Saying switching from ICE to EV is easy is different than saying the switch from ICE to EV is simpler than nothing to EV. Starting an EV company IS difficult. We have success stories, but we also have many bust stories (Faraday Future and Nikola). However, for these big car manufactures to switch to EV is not \"easy\". First they need to secure GOOD battery production by building factories or contracting with other companies which isn't favorable because that will be more expensive in the long run, and if they do start making their own batteries, they need to secure raw material sources. Also, the infrastructure that you are dismissing is a big deal too. The switch to EV will not be complete if we do not have the infrastructure to support it. Tesla is successful because of it has one of the most successful charging station infrastructure. People are paranoid to buy EVs cuz of fear of running out of juice. Having good infrastructure and high battery range fixes the issue. It's not just about making cars. That's billions of investments to catch up to pure EV companies. Also, there is another issue that isn't talked about that often. Big car companies like GM and F depend on dealerships to sell their cars. Selling EVs isn't that profitable for them at all. EVs do not have maintenance problems like ICE cars, which drives some of their profits. I found [this](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/150-cadillac-dealers-accept-buyouts-rather-than-tool-up-for-electric-models-report) after a quick search. 20% of Cadillac dealerships accepted a buyout deal instead of changing things around to be EV friendly. Now don't change the argument. My problem was with you saying that it's really easy for the big guys to switch from ICE to EVs. It's NOT.

But its what led up to it. Back when Clinton was still in office you could finance a house up to 125% of its value, so many people were buying home they already could not afford and automatically negative on the loan. Fast forward to late 07 all those homes were just now reaching equal value to the loan. \n\nNow this is when a lot of shorting was starting to go on in the stock market, however consumer trading was not very big back then at all so hedge funds were being very victorious in it. Some businesses started doing lay offs, people lost jobs but not at an alarming rate just yet. But it created a ripple effect. When layoffs happen larger then usual it puts many people into the job market which on the flip side makes businesses offer less pay to try and get a deal on cheaper labor. To add to this, fuel was getting expensive. So up to this point, you have unemployment climbing slowly, fuel prices climbing. \n\nNow into 08, government spending starting increasing, consumer spending started dropping, fuel still rising, unemployment still rising. Remember the homes people bought for too much? Ok now a good portion of homes started going into foreclosure, however rates were higher so housing sales were slowing down. This is when it started getting bad. More and more businesses got shorted, more jobs lost, more lost homes. Banks started loosing money. Banks had been selling mortgages to security brokers the whole time to try and loose the weight they knew was coming. \n\nFast forward to later 08. At this point the overvalued (keyword here) mortgage securities were secured by hedge funds, banks were still loosing money due to poor financial regulations (cough...greed) and dumping every poor loan they could and coming up short, and no one was buying. Then it happened, banks tried for a bailout and didnt get it. Hedge funds took losses and then put those losses on the market to make up for it, and shorted a lot of people. They made billions, people lost jobs. The market dropped that day like 770% if I remember correctly. \n\nSo now all those overvalued homes, foreclosed, overvalued market paid by hedge funds that were funded by those mortgages are now worthless because the funding source is worthless. The whole market nose dived (adjusted). \n\nIn a nutshell they artificially inflated the economy by moving so much money around. Then after the bubble couldnt grow anymore, it popped. Thats what we are in now. This economy is heavily inflated. Unemployment is high, consumer spending is low, government spending is extremely high, fuel is going high, housing is high on top of people buying homes for the past 4 years that they already need 2 incomes to pay for, and their just pumping more tax dollars out to cover stuff that is already overvalued. Its a huge bubble. And it is going to pop. The only difference this time is as far as we know, there not making the mistake of dumping overvalued mortgages on hedge funds, they are going to make the lenders eat that directly this time. In the long run us consumers always end up paying for it.\n\nEdit** im sure there are some typos in there. Typing on a small iphone\n\nEdit 2** ok so I have some more time again. Now just to be clear, its normal for the stock market to rise and fall. Now non matter what we do, the market is still going to heavily adjust soon. There is one situation that can assist in the transition and make it slower but its still gonna be bad.\n\nUnemployment, its high. But this time its high because of Corona. A mixture of people who did loose jobs because of real health concerns. For example the meat factories that shut down. They got laid off and probably wont be back to work at that plant for a long time unless they find something else. \n\nThen you have people who simply had business slow down and they trimmed people off to stay operational. These people could go back to work, but they are making enhanced unemployment which is close to what they made before and they are not driving to work. So they are choosing to ride the unemployment train (I would too). \n\nNow all these people handle their money differently but the three main groups are the ones who handle it well, and those who don‚Äôt. Here are the situations.\n\nGroup A. People regardless if their income is working or unemployment, keep paying their bills and don‚Äôt buy stuff they cant afford. They pocket the stimulus checks or pay off debt. \n\nGroup B. People regardless if their income is working or unemployment. Go out and buy things (on loans/credit cards) that require down payments. They could not afford this stuff before but due to stimulus money they have enough to get the loan. They are not paying certain bills because of the relief bill allowing to defer the payments to the end of the loan (basically changing the maturity date). So they are acquiring debt they can‚Äôt pay on top of not paying their existing bills, also the mortgage. These are the ones who will heavily contribute to problems.\n\nGroup C, these are the ones cause the biggest ripple within the consumers. These are the people who are strictly on unemployment. Not paying bills they dont have to at the moment, and blowing every penny they get before they get it. \n\nWhen the stimulus protection and money goes away, and lenders start coming after the money that is owed to them, people in group B and C are going to be in a world of hurt, especially group C. Because now the job market will flood hard. To hard for employers to require that much demand. Now all the bills are due and people in group C are screwed. They blew their money and have nothing left and now go delinquent, which turns into foreclosure and collections. Now you have recovered items and a foreclosed home thats in negative equity with the lender. No one is going to be running buy an overpriced home, so they sit.\n\nNow group B, they start trying to sell off things they can to avoid foreclosure, they drag it out. The ones who kept working barely get but have a new debt they couldnt afford to begin with. These people have collection accounts created. Eventually leans get put on a house, fast forward to foreclosure. \n\nGroup A will be the last ones effected, it wont hurt them till the crash. Now at this point jobs are still scarce, lots of debt accounts are opened, no one is buying anything because their all playing catch up. So now lenders and banks are in possession of property that isnt worth what is owed. No one will buy those debts. The banks start to eat it. The banks will try and cover their losses by liquidating stocks and selling off. Thats when we start adjusting moderately. This creates a ripple, this is when others start selling off to shorten their losses. Companies now start downsizing again to lessen expenses, they also sell off stocks if they hold any. Now unemployment goes up again, people in group A start getting laid off now. Now were getting flooded with foreclosures, job loss, and assets that are not worth what they owe. \n\nThis continues until either banks accept their loss and start to list properties at heavily discounted prices, the few people who havent lost their job may seek a loan to purchase new cheap property (people who have been renting) thus funding the banks/lenders. People who did loose their job take a lower paying one to bring in money. They now have options to purchase property at a more affordable price compared to their new income. \n\nOption 2, (highly unlikely) people stop blowing money. Not going into more detail bc it wont happen.\n\nOption 3, banks reach out for a bail out. If it passes, this wont help, because now they covered a huge loss and dont have to sell at a discount. They will sit on the prices and invest that money into shorting the stock market that they basically control at this point. Thus making a fortune and tanking the market.\n\nLets say they actually do whats right, and list the properties for short sales. People start getting loans again to recover from what they lost. Thus funding the banks which in return had the bank invest again and bringing value to the market.\n\nThe only way we can make the next crash easier, is if the government stops blowing money into companies and into the direct hands of the people. If the people get most of the money they will spend it. Thus funding businesses, which keeps jobs open and money moving. Also if people get this money, they need to catch up on bills they havent been required to pay. If we actually acted out this scenario, instead of a big crash, we would just endure a brief sharp adjustment that would be much easier then what we have coming. \n\nAs you can see by this last stimulus package, the money is barely going to the people. That has been the problem with the stimulus packages from the start. Stimulating the economy can be done way better to prevent a big crash, but it has to be distributed correctly.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you so much for your response.
