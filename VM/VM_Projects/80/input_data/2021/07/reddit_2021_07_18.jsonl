From that moment on, if you had an older car you would need to come in to get the new computer installed if you wanted FSD. Until now there was only one way to get FSD which was to buy it outright. Tesla offered the hardware upgrade for free to anyone buying FSD. Now however there are 2 ways to get FSD. Tesla still offers the free hardware upgrade to those who buy FSD outright, but they do not offer it to customers of the subscription service. Fittingly so, because the subscription has no financial commitment beyond one month of fees. Tesla could end up losing a lot of money putting HW3 computers into cars that rarely ever end up using FSD, or even worse, given the supply chain shortage they might end up using chips that could have gone into a new FSD equipped cars that now have to wait for completion.\n\nIt's unfortunate Tesla was unable to stay true to their word about all cars being FSD capable, but like i said this promise was broken the day HW3.0 came out.
