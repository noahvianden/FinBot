Everything is just connected and easy to transfer.

We saw how this played out in the PC space already - anyone could make a windows computer. 75% of the market now is Android. Apple is regaining small market share but it's just a cyclical oscillation that occurs due to all the other platforms dropping to zero in the last couple years. E.g. if 5% of Android users decide to give iPhone a try and 10% of iPhone users decide to switch to Android, iPhone still gains market share when it's far enough behind (so you get the feedback effect we see now).\n\nThe problem with closed platforms is they will eventually find themselves behind. There are just too many competitors - it's Apple vs. the world. Wearables, automotive, VR, AI capabilities... there are tons of ways the landscape is going to change in the next 10 years and it's highly likely Apple finds itself behind. Camera upgrades and poo emojis can only get you so far - eventually people don't need your new product.\n\nApple also charges a fee to develop apps. It's free on Android. On Android you can bypass the app store easily and download any app, even from a web address, on iOS it is a massive pain (we see this with fortnite).\n\nAlso we are at peak phones now - I only see downward pressure on margins due to the competition. Apple cannot get away with such high margins anymore - the only reason we don't see that (their margin is only slightly falling) is because they've added all these other high margin business to offset it (i.e. their services they've expanded in the last couple years). The reality is they're losing margin on their phones and they won't be able to hide that in their numbers forever (they certainly tried when they changed their reporting two years ago).\n\nSo those are my concerns with Apple. I always felt their original PE ratio was correct. Once Buffet got in on them they experienced PE expansion which is irrational IMO and I predict will correct itself at some point.\n\nThat's my opinion anyway. I think the market is really messed up right now based on bad speculation.\n\nFor reference, I'd say IBM, INTC, AAPL, and MSFT should be way closer in terms of PE than they actually are. Something more in line with reality would be IBM -> 10, INTC -> 14, AAPL -> 18, MSFT -> 22. MSFT and especially AAPL sitting at 30+ is just ridiculous, as is IBM hovering around 25.

It is inefficient to have two platforms that do essentially the same thing. The market will converge on one, and it will be the one that has the most users. This is what happened with Windows. The only difference here is Apple had a large first mover advantage, but they still made the same business mistake. You'll see.\n\n> There are plenty of examples of widely used software that are not open sourced\n\nI wasn't talking about \"open source\". I was talking about an open platform. Windows is an open platform - you can put windows on any computer, you can easily just download the programs you need to develop for the platform, etc. That's NOT true for Mac or Apple products. Only Apple products can run iOS. You need to pay a fee to develop for them. You need to go through their app store. That's a closed platform.\n\n> And Apple has won in every single field they have entered\n\nThey just won in one field when they developed the iPhone. That's it. For processors that was TSMC not Apple, there is nothing special about their arch - in many ways it's worse than the competition. Android surpassed them long ago in terms of features and they played catch up. What happens when they are playing catch up on the next important features that people really care about?\n\nYou know what I say is obviously true. Apple vs. the world, the odds are way better that the world will develop a better solution through free market competition. Apple cannot be the best at everything, thus their closed platform is a fundamentally flawed business.\n\n> 99% of people on this planet just download from App Store directly, whether it is iOS or Android\n\nMaybe that's true at the current moment. It wasn't true when they took Fornite off the appstore. Developers are moving away from there and can offer cheaper services when they don't have to pay apple their cut or get their approval. So either apple will need to lower their margins considerably from the insanely high 30%+ or they will lose business to the competition.\n\n> If you think that they are committing a financial fraud\n\nWhat? When did I ever say that? I said their profit margin. In 2015 they had a margin of 30%. Before the pandemic their margin was 24% and falling. My point was that this is DESPITE the introduction of their new high margin services revenue streams, which push margins up, so that tells you the margins of their core business are actually worse and trend down. Just as I predicted in this analysis.\n\n> if you think that smartphone sales are at peak (which is incorrect)\n\nNo it's not.

Apple still makes more profits selling Mac than any OEM manufacturer like Dell or HP, and this number is only increasing. This makes their decision to close MacOS a success.\n\n\\> They just won in one field when they developed the iPhone.\n\niPod, Mac, Watch, Tablet, AirPods are other industries where they entered and they dominate in those categories (with iPod obviously getting \"replaced\" with iPhone).\n\n\\> It wasn't true when they took Fornite off the appstore\n\nStill, less than 1% cared of iPhone users cared.\n\n\\> If you think that they are committing a financial fraud\n\nYou said Apple has negative margins, not that margins are decreasing.

Here you are talking about business as a whole and not margins per phone; then you must realize that margins can very much decrease because apple is entering many fields such as services, VR/AR and self-driving, so expenses would naturally increase.
