{"title": "Advanced Micro Devices: Bullish DD in collaboration w/ u/TheTendilorian", "selftext": "In response to DD posted earlier today by [u/TheTendilorian](https://www.reddit.com/u/TheTendilorian/), I saw an opportunity to steal the show for myself. (Kidding, [u/TheTendilorian](https://www.reddit.com/u/TheTendilorian/) did fantastic work and you can find their post on $AMD financials rightttttttttt: [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oe88ub/amd_su_bae_witness_me/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf).\n\n$AMD is easily my fav stock and I'm perpetually bullish on it, however there's a lot of catalysts that will have effects on $AMD both negative and positive at all stages. I'm not passing this on as financial advice, just my opinions:\n\n**Chip Shortage**\n\nThis one is the most significant situation in regards to semiconductors and the wider tech industry. In many cases it helps the bullish argument since $AMD (and[ also $NVDA](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/nvda/earnings) but fuckem) continues to exceed earnings estimates despite the rough environment. The[ expansion of $TSMC into America](https://www.reuters.com/technology/tsmc-says-construction-has-started-arizona-chip-factory-2021-06-01/), in my opinion, is going to launch $AMD into the fuckin' stratosphere over the next couple of years. Though still based in Taiwan, TSMC is one of the biggest players in global semiconductor production. As of March, $AMD was [‚ÄúTSMC‚Äôs number one customer in regard to purchasing 7nm wafers‚Äù](https://www.notebookcheck.net/AMD-overtakes-Apple-as-TSMC-s-main-7nm-customer.528532.0.html).\n\nAdditionally, let‚Äôs talk about the economic giant we call China. I‚Äôm an International Relations student so this is right up my ~~asshole~~ alley. While current President Biden has mentioned reversing some of the hardline policies of his predecessor President Trump, however there has been little evidence of progress towards that goal. Two weeks ago, the Biden Administration [blocked an attempt by a Chinese firm to purchase Korean chip manufacturer *Magnachip*](https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/06/22/biden-semiconductors-south-korea-china-trade-war/). A small company, sure, but we can extrapolate this stance to assume that TSMC could be off limits to Chinese acquisition in the future if the US and Taiwan can come to a formal agreement. Who knows how long this US-China measuring contest will go on, but the evidence suggests to me that it would not drastically affect the prices of semiconductor companies.\n\nBeing the massive pussy that I am though, I'm concerned about how an impending crash will impact overall liquidity and the supply and demand of semiconductor chips,[ which computing technology consumes about 1/3 of](https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/semiconductors/devices/how-and-when-the-chip-shortage-will-end-in-4-charts). But obviously if we all lose our homes, we would have bigger fish to fry than worrying about $AMD share price.\n\n**Innovation**\n\nI'm an avid PC gamer. I literally have nothing going on other than my Steam account and my Fidelity account. This is (not) a cry for help. IMO, $NVDA has the best net technology for GPUs. However $AMD offers more consumer-friendly products. I believe that $AMD cards offer the best value per dollar paid. (Unless you're one of those idiots paying 5 grand for a graphics card. I mean c‚Äômon, you can watch Pornhub Premium without an RTX 3080.) This catalyst is just going to be driven by overall consumer sentiment. If people begin realizing that their value is better spent on $AMD graphics cards, that[ market share](https://www.statista.com/statistics/754557/worldwide-gpu-shipments-market-share-by-vendor/) is gonna be gobbled the fuck up. Oh and processors? Yeah, $INTC is a piece of shit that I'm not concerned with. No source, just facts. Kidding, here‚Äôs some cool charts [comparing processor performance](https://www.tomshardware.com/features/amd-vs-intel-cpus):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ltbr4vp74h971.png?width=1796&format=png&auto=webp&s=45c616a97d7eb16d80cc58ffd7cbe7b019680c6b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e6q6igj84h971.png?width=1839&format=png&auto=webp&s=f51f28cc2194bffa3e615f60ab09e0b9b661c7b5\n\nI won‚Äôt lie, the new i9 5.1 GHz is an absolute beast, but the difference is almost negligible compared to the Ryzens, which are priced lower.\n\n**$NVDA Stock Split 20 June 2021**\n\nFuckin' $NVDA... always raining on the $AMD parade. I'm not angry, just disappointed. This stock split is actually pretty insignificant. Does this change any of the fundamentals between the two? Fuck no. Am I looking forward to it? Eh. Is there a point to me including this section? Kinda! As [u/TheTendilorian](https://www.reddit.com/u/TheTendilorian/) said to me, $AMD is a bit of a ‚Äúlate-bloomer‚Äù compared to $NVDA which can be seen as the current titan of the GPU space. I expect the price of $NVDA post-split (1:4) to be somewhere between $150 and $250 just based on previous prices and my exceptional arithmetic skills. While this is still above $AMD stock price, I think it will be easier to perform comparative technical analysis between the two companies when the prices are closer. Compare that with the fundamentals I wrote about earlier and you have got one bullish ass stock.\n\n**Price Outlook**\n\nIf I was Michael Burry and had enough coke and psilocybin I would tell you guys the price target a year from now. But I'm a broke college student with no coke and only a little shrooms, so it's whatever.\n\n\\- Short term I'm playing AMD calls pretty close to the chest. Currently holding 7/9 $95c and 8/20 $100c. I roll up or down depending on how the week has gone. $AMD has been trading sideways since the run-up last June with a high of $99.23 and a solid floor around $72-$73. For a quick swing of shares I try to enter anywhere under $80 and exit above‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs call it $86.50. As of now, I‚Äôm looking out for an announcement stating the date of the Q2 earnings call (I‚Äôm guessing August) and I‚Äôm looking for $AMD to continue its run and retest $95 before a post-earnings dip.\n\nI‚Äôve charted pivot points for our current trading range as follows:\n\n$85.57\n\n$86.10\n\nPsychological resistance at whole values between $87 and $93.\n\n$93.55\n\n$95\n\nATH of 99.23\n\n[Here's what my $AMD chart currently looks like](https://preview.redd.it/wvvxr1105h971.png?width=1039&format=png&auto=webp&s=218b06ed3e405ab02dea6a7770212d2bb15f1d69)\n\n\\- Mid-term? I don't fucking know, get back to me if the market crashes. If not, 6-12months out, $100-$120 with a floor around $85-$90 just based on how we've been growing and the fact that resistance->support. As mentioned I‚Äôm expecting a bit of a pullback soon since tech has been absolutely soaring the last two weeks, but seeing $85-$90 turn into support is not unreasonable in the near future. Honestly I‚Äôm much more uncertain about mid-term compared to short or long time frames.\n\n\\- Long term: $NVDA levels. I believe with all my heart that $AMD is the better company and should be valued as such. They are a company that continues to exceed expectations and make great connections in the computing industry. For shares I would just buy and hold until I retire. (Mod who reviewed my post in its baby stages told me that ‚Äúbuy and hold‚Äù was a questionable term to use. I‚Äôve heard the term ‚Äúinvesting‚Äù passed around other subreddits but hell if I know what that means.)\n\n**Bottom Line**\n\nMe and my good pal Tendo heavily believe in this company, as I‚Äôm sure many others do. No price target if I‚Äôm going to take a 1+ yr position. Under $80 if I‚Äôm going for a swing trade that will last one month or less.\n\nSo yeah, that's about it.

While NVidia sometimes puts their boot up their asshole wrt drivers, they generally just tickle the ring whereas AMD started with the booth firmly ensconced in the lower intestine and have been struggling to remove it. They have improved, but are still a ways behind.\n\nTheir CPUs are really good right now and Intel are floundering. That said they are still hampered because most current software isn't very good at multi threading so single core performance is important, especially for gaming, and Intel are competitive there. They are eating Intel in data centers though.\n\nThe big thing for me is that AMD have a runway - theyre still behind but have better CPUs and the data centre uptake is very bullish. Supply could become an issue here, because the big data centre players won't want to wait or to overpay. But assuming adequate supply there should be noticeable growth in the data center side, and of course GPU supply constraints mean that they will continue to sell as many as they make.", "score": 15, "replies": [{"body": "Well said.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "> They‚Äôre better than Intel and NVDA in price:performance\n\nby making less profit than intel and nvidia, though this year they are probably beating intel outright since intel's chips are generally crap.\n\nI think 2022-2023 will be when shit hits the fan. If AMD is still making huge gains in performance and slide past nvidia at that point I think AMD will do more than just grow, they'll take over the market, but I don't think its as obvious as people think it is.

NVDA is a different beast in that they have the growth of AMD while having the stellar gross margins.

I do not believe AMD and Su Bae are focused on catching NVDA, and are more concerned with taking market share from and crushing Intel. All the DDs written on here continue to ignore how important the Xilinx merger is. It was hated on by many, but Su Bae is no moron, she is strongly positioning AMD to dominate the CPU and Semi-Custom solutions.

We just have to accept it as it is. NVDA is something you should also look to get into when the price isnt so stupid. AMD is not NVDA though. Dont expect those price levels.

Intel's comments on \"chiplets glued together\"? Well those chiplets glued together are what allow AMD to make much better yields on smaller die sizes. When a wafer has an issue, you lose a lower portion of the wafer if you have smaller dies, or chiplets. So now AMD has several years lead on making chiplet designs talk to eachother faster or more efficiently.\n\nIntel is however throwing in the towel and going to pay for EUV by TSMC in 2023. AMD has advance plans for 2023 with TSMC anyway and think they are second customer behind Apple so should be on a more even playing field moving forward in 2023, with the advantage of maybe 5 years with infinity fabric and chiplet design instead of monolithic dies.
