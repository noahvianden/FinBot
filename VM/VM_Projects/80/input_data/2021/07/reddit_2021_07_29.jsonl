Here are some suggestions for you to help remove psychological pressure from trading time. \n\nWhen evaluating your actions, don't ask yourself whether the trade you made was a good trade or bad trade. It's very hard to \"make good trades\" and it puts too much pressure on you when a trade goes wrong. It's much easier to \"make a good strategy\" and to \"follow a strategy\". So instead you can ask yourself\n\n1. Is my strategy a good one?\n2. Do my trades match my strategy?\n\nYou should expect a certain percentage to fail based on your strategy, and as long as it's in the right range you don't need to investigate every trade.\n\nI think you believe in your strategy. The question is why did you deviate from the strategy? The most common mistake is when your strategy too vague, which allows you to \"fudge\" your decision making process. Maybe you can write down exactly what your strategy is and look for situations that match. Never change your strategy during a trading session.  If you want to make a trade that doesn't match your strategy, force yourself to wait until trading time is over and update your strategy.  When making a trade, state out loud to yourself why the trade matches your strategy. Then you remove your psychology from the equation, and you have a simple test you can do to see if a trade is strategic or emotional.\n\n\n> Any logic to stepping away from the market for a few days or rest of week after a big score?\n\nNo, not just because of the big win. You should step away if you catch yourself deviating from your strategy, whether the trade wins or loses. You can also step away if you feel strongly tempted and you're worried you will deviate. \n\n\nContext for this recommendation: There is a psychological study done where people are given two tasks, one easy and one cumbersome. They are given a coin and asked to assign one task to themselves and one to a stranger based on the outcome of a coin flip.  Almost 80% gave themselves the easy task, despite the probability of winning the coin flip being 50%.

Robinhood will innovate drastically and develop ways to make money that is not payment for order flow in the future thus increasing the profit margins and net income.\n2. Robinhood will increase their userbase by 150x equating to 2.54billion people, all of which have an average balance of the current user base in USA where stimulus checks , money printers, and high disposable income go brrrr.\n3. Robinhood increases the net revenue generated by each user by around 150x. Either 150x more volume is traded per user, or the bid/ask spreads from payment for routing exceeds 150x current.\n4. A combination of the above. 50x user growth and 3x profit margin growth.\n5. Assume that operating costs are fairly negligible and linear due to SaaS being economies of scale based.\n\nBear Case:\n\n1. Robinhood is a \"Trading software that's thinly veiled as a technology company\" and should be given the P/E of a tech company that can scale exponentially.\n2. Robinhood faces regulatory risk expanding outside of USA and even if every man woman and child deposits what the average APE has on the platform right now and trades at the frequency of an average RH APE- We would reach a P/E of 217.\n3. If Robin hood abolishes the methods of: \"Payment for order flow and uses monthly fees/data charges\" it will lose a large part of the entirety of its' branding. It would be like if Apple abolished the iPhone. Free Trading is their Model.\n4. As Order Flow is a linear business, 1 unit of order flow results in $1 extra. In order to reach 150x multiplier to reduce PE to 'reasonable tech company levels' we would be looking at 150x the net volume being transacted on Robinhood.\n5. Robinhood\n\nExcerpts from S-1 Filing:\n\nWe incurred operating losses each year since our inception in 2013 through 2019, including net losses of $6.1 million, $57.5 million, and $106.6 million for fiscal 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively. We expect our operating expenses to continue to increase in the future as we increase our sales and marketing efforts, continue to invest in research and development, further develop our products and services, improve and expand our customer support functions and expand into new geographies.\n\nMoreover, as of March 31, 2021, options to purchase 18,096,127 shares of our Class A common stock with a weighted-average exercise price of approximately $2.23 per share were outstanding and 81,820,160 shares of our Class A common stock were subject to outstanding RSUs (including 27,663,658 shares subject to 2019 Market-Based RSUs).\n\nThere are currently > 96 million shares held by employees.\n\nFunding Rounds:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Year |Amount|Valuation|Baggers at IPO price|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|2017|110m|1.3b|24x|\n|2018|363m|5.6b|5.7x|\n|2019|323m|7.6b|4.2x|\n|2020 |280m|8.3b|3.8x|\n|2020|320m|8.6b|3.7x|\n|2020|200m|11.2b|2.8x|\n|2020|460m|11.7b|2.7x|\n|IPO Price||32b||\n\nBull Case 1:\n\nRobin Hood has been growing at a very fast rate therefore its' valuations validate this. The insider investors are incentivized to hold.\n\nBear Case 1:\n\nThe insiders made anywhere between a minimum of 2.7 --> 24x already within the last few years, private firms typically take profits and reinvest in other startups. (Unless Robinhood grows at exponential rates going forwards)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSelling Pressures:\n\nImagine if you're an Ape working at RH and you can cash in on a 10-20 bagger immediately in 30-days, would you sell?\n\nAn average engineer who worked at Robinhood for 4 - years on average holds \\~ $400k-800k in RSUs (at a price of $2 per share). At the time of IPO we're looking at $4-8m if you sell. Maybe you hold, maybe not in.\n\nIf you're an investor who invested in Series G-1 , G-2 (the lastest bagholders). You've got yourself a 1-2 bagger already in 1 year.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPersonal Opinion:\n\nRobin hood is being evaluated as a \"Growing Tech company\" at multipliers that seem unreasonable.\n\nRobinhood does not have a roadmap that provides a way to reach earnings through their current model which is Payment for Orderflow.\n\nEven with the introduction of their \\[censored\\]currency, Coinbase ambitiously is boasting a forward P/E of 30x.\n\nEven as a growing Fintech like Square is at a P/E at 201x, and mature Fintech such as Paypal is at 30x.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPositions: Short 500 shares of RH\n\nThis is not financial advice, tons of companies fuck over their customers at some point. GME/AMC - JAN madness aside, I'm short this on a pure autist basis. 🐻\n\nSources:\n\nCompetitors:\n\n[https://www.businessofapps.com/data/robinhood-statistics/](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/robinhood-statistics/)\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1783879/000162828021013318/robinhoods-1.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1783879/000162828021013318/robinhoods-1.htm)\n\nDetails of Lock-up and insider Holdings\n\n[https://www.jioforme.com/robin-hood-sets-ipo-prices-at-the-lower-end-of-the-range-and-rates-trading-apps-at-26-7-billion/633014/](https://www.jioforme.com/robin-hood-sets-ipo-prices-at-the-lower-end-of-the-range-and-rates-trading-apps-at-26-7-billion/633014/)\n\n[https://craft.co/robinhood/funding-rounds](https://craft.co/robinhood/funding-rounds)Employee Sources, cross-referenced with Blind, and the TC seems pretty in line.\n\n[https://www.levels.fyi/company/Robinhood/salaries/Software-Engineer/](https://www.levels.fyi/company/Robinhood/salaries/Software-Engineer/)\n\n[https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/robinhood/company\\_financials](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/robinhood/company_financials)", "id": "ou461z", "created_utc": 1627586093.0, "score": 38, "upvote_ratio": 0.69, "num_comments": 81, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|10|**First Seen In WSB**|7 months ago\n**Total Comments**|647|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jzvugd/lgvw_spac/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ou461z/robinhood_dd_discussions_welcome/) \n**Account Age**|4 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Dont buy.
