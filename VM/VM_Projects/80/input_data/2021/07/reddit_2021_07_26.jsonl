{"title": "Why the crash is coming", "selftext": "Listen up you scrotal fungi:\n\nEverybody and their mom's four tag-team boyfriends are predicting the biggest market-crash since Hitler dropped the atom bomb. The bulls argue 'buffet says to buy when people are fearful.' Well empty your infected anal-glands you retarded chimpanzees... people are fearful BECAUSE THERE IS GOOD REASON TO BE FEARFUL.\n\n1. China is tanking. The propped up and lying Chinese economy is being crushed reminiscent of the Japanese invasion. Your upper double-digit IQ brain might ask 'but why tf do I care about China I don't live in China.' The phone you're about to lose all your money on was made there, and the world economy is connected.\n2. The US has spent and continues to spend more money than EXISTS in the world. What do you think is going to happen?\n3. JPOW is stuck between a rock and a hard place. Inflation is awful right now and your extra-retarded two-year-old that came out of the prostitute you plowed 3 years ago knows it is not transitory. Unless JPOW wants to go down as the chair who let inflation go crazy he has to raise rates. AND ALL OF YOU WHO SAY \"He's UnDeR PoLITIcal PRESsuRe to KeeP it LoW from Biden\" are retarded. JPOW is a registered republican, he voted for Trump, and would be happy to see things tank under Biden. He's f\\*\\*\\*ing itching to pull that mf trigger.\n4. YOU are the FINAL reason to be fearful. Lots of retards like yourself have joined the market, and have hyper-inflated the prices. Lots of people throwing money at stocks who know nothing + not making new businesses = SUPER HIGH STOCK PRICES. As soon as the market has a real drop, it's going to drop like Knife Party's Centipede. Retards will panic and pull their 4x leveraged calls on robin hood gold like crazy. \"Diamond Hands\" only work until they don't. We are on the longest bull run almost ever right now, and sure, diamond hands have been great so far. Well, just wait until ANYTHING but the greatest bull-run in history happens...\n\nHow should I play this impending doom? I DONT F\\*\\*\\*ing kNOW. People are betting on the crash and it's probably already priced in. Buy a put for a month out and the crash doesn't happen for two months. Buy a put for a year, and inflation drives prices too high for it to matter. It's a losing game.\n\nPositions: sitting on cash like Pablo Escobar until something f\\*\\*\\*ing happens, + a couple lotto put spreads on SPY\n\nTL/DR: You anal retentive chode, don't tell me how to live my life\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: pictures of my only positions\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ricxythm1md71.png?width=444&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a7adf8d01e8bd0d3e1ef5bfdc69eb9d3916cd99\n\n[my only positions](https://preview.redd.it/jd3q01in1md71.png?width=510&format=png&auto=webp&s=d263ac26d06e1419dd5406076fe684d87d8bbaf8)", "id": "os63m0", "created_utc": 1627327766.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.42, "num_comments": 86, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|4 months ago\n**Total Comments**|2|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|4 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "If inflation is so bad, you’re losing a lot of money on that cash you’re sitting on.
