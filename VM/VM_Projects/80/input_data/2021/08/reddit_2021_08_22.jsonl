{"title": "OnlyFans: The P*rn Empire with no P*rn?", "selftext": "One of the biggest pieces of business news last week was that OnlyFans was going to bar [sexually explicit videos starting from October.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-19/onlyfans-to-block-sexually-explicit-videos-starting-in-october) \n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/3710tif9pwi71.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ca77e000d7399100f36845fa880ef48e4b8d3ae)\n\nAfter the initial uproar and wave of memes, there was a lot of discussion around why a company whose main income stream is from adult content decided to kill its golden goose.\n\n**Was it because they are idiots, or because of any new regulations, or is there something much larger at play here?**\n\nFor this week‚Äôs analysis, I would be focusing on the company‚Äôs history and my take on why they did what they did and future implications for them. So, strap in while I take one for the team with my search history and ad recommendations going into questionable territory for the considerable future.\n\n**The Company**\n\nOnlyFans was launched by Timothy Stokely in 2016. His pitch was simple but effective.\n\n>Why not create a platform that allows these entertainers to conveniently and securely monetize their content? OnlyFans would be like a social media platform with a feed, similar to that of Instagram and Twitter, except that fans are required to pay a monthly subscription to view the content of these entertainers. And if they are willing to pay more, they could unlock paywalls for even more valuable services.\n\nThe company was extremely successful and now hosts more than 2 million content creators. It has a user base of **130 million**. Even though the service is pitched as a website for content creators such as physical fitness experts, musicians, etc., it‚Äôs predominantly known for its adult entertainment category.\n\nThe company had explosive growth during the pandemic with its revenue rising by 540% to reach $400MM. As per a [leaked pitch deck obtained by Axios](https://www.axios.com/onlyfans-investors-struggle-9cc92523-6607-40ad-9893-4175e7966b52.html) (ironically, the company never mentions p\\*rn in its pitch deck), it‚Äôs expected to create a whopping $2.5B in revenue by 2022.\n\n**The Problem**\n\nSo, if the growth is great and the user base is becoming more and more engaged, why did the company decide to shoot itself in the foot?\n\nAs with most issues in a company, the problem lies with money! They are facing serious challenges in both the revenue stream as well as investor capital.\n\n**Investor Capital**\n\n[ Leaked video of OnlyFans CEO preparing for his investor pitch! ](https://reddit.com/link/p9c0zc/video/kmquh3vbpwi71/player)\n\nEven with the explosive growth, it‚Äôs not like investors are lining up for the fundraising. It would be a walk in the park to raise funding for any other company with its growth trajectory and profitability. But there are multiple challenges in the case of OnlyFans:\n\n* Some VC funds are prohibited from investing in adult content as part of their partnership agreements.\n* Even though OnlyFans has a verification process, the risk of minors creating subscription accounts is real and will do irreversible reputation damage for both the company and its investors.\n\nEven if the investors could look past all of this as the company looks to raise [new funding at unicorn valuation](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-16/onlyfans-is-said-to-seek-funding-at-valuation-above-1-billion), OnlyFans has a reputation problem. Even if the brand could move on to a ‚Äúsafe for work‚Äù platform, the history associated with the brand is synonymous with adult content.\n\nGiven its history, it would be extremely difficult to attract brand partners and big names into the platform. The presence of big names is a must for a platform trying to become a more mainstream media site!\n\n**Payment Processing**\n\nWhile brand imaging and raising capital might be a longer-term problem for the company, the more pressing issue is a [BBC investigation into how the company handles illegal content](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-58255865) and its ramifications. If you thought Google had monopolistic power, let me introduce you to\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/b280g33epwi71.png?width=300&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e86b71b9a32ddc23438a7eb30a65cf8300acad8)\n\nVisa and Mastercard combinedly process [more than 90% of transactions and 75% of transaction volume](https://fortunly.com/articles/credit-card-market-share/#gref) of all Credit card purchases in the US. In Dec 2020, after a NY Times article about how P\\*rnHub monetizes illegal content, both Visa and Mastercard cut off payments to the site within 6 days! \\[1\\]. This caused them to remove 70% of all content (unverified) on their website (aka The Purge) to try and get the payment platforms on board. Visa and Mastercard still won‚Äôt work with the company even after all the drastic actions taken by P\\*rnHub.\n\nGiven that the OnlyFans platform doesn‚Äôt show any ads, they would be dead in the water if their direct payment takes a hit. In April, Mastercard had announced a change to their policy \\[2\\] that requires this:\n\n>The banks that connect merchants to our network... to certify that the seller of adult content has effective controls in place to monitor, block and, where necessary, take down all illegal content.\n\nThe policy will come into effect on October 15th and OnlyFans is trying to be compliant by the time the policy is enforced \\[3\\] and it seems like they are going by the logic that desperate times require desperate measures \\[4\\]! ¬†\n\n**What now?**\n\nThe Billion dollar question is whether OnlyFans would go the way Tumblr went (Tumblr was [once valued at $1.1B and was sold later for $3M](https://www.dignited.com/51316/tumblr-sold-3m-wordpress/)) after they banned all adult content on their website.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/39wrvfpfpwi71.png?width=1149&format=png&auto=webp&s=4a7f50652d4abf9af39d776c25e0f85faa3e3ece)\n\nIt seems that OnlyFan‚Äôs aspirations of becoming a mainstream media company and increasing regulations by payment partners are forcing the company to abandon the adult segment. While we currently don‚Äôt have an insight into their revenue split, it‚Äôs safe to say that a majority of it would be coming from the adult segment which would make the pivot even harder to pull off successfully.\n\nI don‚Äôt know a single company that has survived after throwing their most loyal userbase and revenue generators under the bus for greener pastures! Maybe they are just concerned about their short-term survival and were forced to make this decision. But dropping the same folks who made you popular in the first place is definitely going to leave a bad aftertaste.\n\nAfter all, what do *we* know? Running a billion-dollar company is a [very serious business!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROaj3bCpZEM&ab_channel=InternetHistorian)\n\nUntil next week!\n\n**Footnotes**\n\n\\[1\\] This would cause all normal credit card transactions to fail and then the only way for them to charge would be to directly get paid to their bank accounts or via crypt\\*, both of which would be extremely difficult to process and scale.\n\n\\[2\\] While there is a lot of chatter around how certain groups lobbied Mastercard to change their policy, I am not getting into that as it would inevitably take a political turn.\n\n\\[3\\] To put this into perspective, if 4 companies (Visa, Mastercard, AmEx, and Discover) cut off your payment pipeline, you would effectively have no way to charge your customer!\n\n\\[4\\] There is a lot of conversation around how this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for crypt\\* to shine with the decentralized payment system.\n\n\\[5\\] Granted, they were already seeing reduced engagement prior to the ban, but the adult content ban was the final nail in the coffin! [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtUuab1Aqg0&t=162s&ab_channel=CollegeHumor) is a hilarious parody video of Tumblr CEO explaining the ban!\n\n\\[6\\]Apologies for filtering out all the adult words as I didn‚Äôt want to get tagged in spam filters.\n\n*As always, please note that I am not a financial advisor.*¬†Hope you enjoyed this week‚Äôs analysis.", "id": "p9c0zc", "created_utc": 1629637155.0, "score": 85, "upvote_ratio": 0.77, "num_comments": 86, "comments": [{"body": "How do you have investment issues when you're making 20% on $2B annually?", "score": 50, "replies": [{"body": "Storage and bandwidth issues.

My DD for you is: Sony is playing to be the biggest name in the Anime production/distribution business. Just google about their latest acquisition. Now, go away and buy shares to make your waifu happy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wm91zleyf2j71.png?width=1624&format=png&auto=webp&s=94e2e2ff169ee898691203bf0a4945a9d556b4ce\n\nFor the rest of you who are actually decend people, I have the sweetest of DD. It's broken down in two parts:\n\n1. The single most compelling argument to load up on $SONY: PSN\n2. The rest of the business\n\n**PSN and Netflix: what the fuck is going on here?**\n\nLet's assume Sony sold nothing but PSN subscriptions. This company would not be too dissimilar to Netflix as:\n\n1. Their stream of revenue comes from subscriptions (avg monthly price on Netflix: $10, PSN $8\\*).\n2. Their main cost is keeping the servers up and running.\n3. Netflix would also have to pay for production and licensing, so I expect Sony to have a better margin. Beacause of this, I assume their net monthly income from a single user to be the same.\n4. Future subscribers growth will be flat for both companies.\n\nCurrently, Netflix has 209 million subscribers and a market cap of $242B.\n\nPSN has 109 million subscribers. If we agree on the 4 points I mentioned above, the **market cap of PSN alone** would be $126B, based on Netflix's standards.\n\nThe current market cap of Sony is (drum roll...) $122B. According to SONY's latest earning release, gaming (TOTAL Playstation universe, etc., not just PSN subscriptions!) will represent 33% of total 2021 income.\n\nMake as many counterarguments as you want (Netflix will grow more, the value of a PSN subscriber is worth less, etc...), but even if we slash my assumed PSN market cap in half, we are **so far away** from a fair valuation of $SONY.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h8p9vjavf2j71.png?width=970&format=png&auto=webp&s=2456dfd970e60bb33ea438a1f4ac9c35ccd2b83b\n\n**The business**\n\nLet's have a look at a couple of other numbers to understand if $SONY's low valuation is justified by a terrible business.\n\nOperating income (year ended March): 2018 JPY 730B. 2019 JPY 826B. 2020 JPY 832B. 2021 JPY 968B. TTM JPY 1,022B. -> they are growing income\n\nCash Flow: I'm too lazy to type in all numbers but they went from (JPY B) 1,2T in 2018 to 1,4T TTM. So no big growth, but stable.\n\nP/E: 11\n\nProfit margin: 13%\n\n~~Price/book: 0.02 ( üòÆ )~~ Edit: it seems that this ratio is miscalculated due to JPY/USD exchange. Looks like the real value is more likely around 2\n\nEnterprise Value/EBITDA: 1.20\n\nIntangible assets as % of total assets: 6,8% (and they have the PlayStation brand among all others... Just for a comparison, Netflix's ratio is 64%).\n\nAlso, they beat 9/10 of latest earnings:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/imqj6jdpf2j71.png?width=1673&format=png&auto=webp&s=2db98000e0a918a2dcbe2fc17bddabd14d03dac0\n\nI personally don't like the numbers here. There is no thrill in investing in something that is not a loss-making, overvalued, declining business  üò¥ . This is a beautiful money making machine that I am paying 2% of BOOK VALUE for. Too easy.\n\nPositions:\n\nSold 11 cash covered puts at various strikes, up to $105.\n\nIV is low, so I'm planning to add some leaps.\n\n\\*These are my assumptions based on the current pricing plan in EU and US and assuming that part of the PSN users don't buy annually but quarterly or monthly (assumption taken because their quartery user count is volatile).
