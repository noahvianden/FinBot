I think initially it will be pretty dumb and not going to do much like maybe only navigate around the house/office, recognize people or pets, say something funny, could also act as a security patrol bot just inside the house/office, movement detection, flash light all that stuff, could be remote operated so you can have it walk around the house and check for stuff if you are on vacation. All of the above should be easy for FSD type computer system. And as you say cost $50k, not a bad guess. So it will basically be mostly a novelty. I bet you, you can sell 100,000 units in first 3 years at that price and functionality. You can’t even sell more than that because of that pesky production. So people with money and love of technology will buy this. The cool thing will be that every 2 weeks they will make a software update and it will be just a bit better. Also having 10s of thousands of them running around will collect that valuable data to make them even better. \n\nNext I think if your production rate is 100,000 units per year you can do a price drop to $30k. Note that at $30k it’s actually very cheap so if it can do a job almost any job it can replace that person that probably was being paid 20-$30k per year, so if you get a bot and it pays for it self in 18 months or less (it’s a steal). If you can for example only have it do dishes or bring food to a table in a restaurant, that’s millions and millions of sold bots in the developed world. When you have millions of bots you get that data again and you make the bot better. Btw you don’t need to make the bot cheaper than $30k if it can do all physical work at that price point you basically have infinite demand. Particularly if the robot works 24/7. With say a few hours of maintenance per month (done by other robots).\n\nI believe that this path for Tesla will be much simpler than people imagine, if they can do FSD they can do Tesla Bot in a relatively slow way listed above. My guess is demo Tesla bot in 2 years, production in 2 years after that, real functionality 3 years after that.

Also what is crazy is that Tesla bot particularly at that point should help with its own production, things could really go parabolic. This also means that Tesla will have access to almost free labor and in theory go into almost any manual labor market with much cheaper costs for example house cleaning, lawn maintenance even home construction, imagine a Tesla designed home with all Tesla products all created to save energy, self powered and be ultra efficient (in all aspects like cleaning maintenance etc) built and maintained by Tesla Bots and cheaper than most other homes.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Lets wait a few decades and find out.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "If it could replace a physical labourer, you'd never be able to afford one.\n\nTesla would probably rent them to companies at lower rates than competitive labour costs, depending on what Tesla was confident Bots could do.
