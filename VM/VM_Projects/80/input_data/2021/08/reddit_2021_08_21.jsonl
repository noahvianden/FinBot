Its an extreme selling point of the software and why they work so closely with the US government is that no one that isn't authorized at the customer is going through the data their software organizes. \n\n\n I think they were very clear about the gold buying that it's a hedge against black swan events. Meaning events NO ONE can see coming. They're not predicting they're just being conservative as fiduciaries of their business. Its just them looking to hedge from a long term perspective. It's also less than 2% of their total cash on hand. \n\nI'm not saying it's impossible that something came across their radar completely internally from their own data or their own perspective but I think it's insanely unlikely that they bought the gold in a predictive manner. I don't think they're trying to time anything I think they're just expanding their security for the very long term of their company. \n\nTo be very clear. They did not aggregate customer data and see some crash coming. That's not what they do. They don't mine anyones data that they work with. It's actually an extreme selling point of their software that no one has access to customer data and its all completely secure. So secure that the US government trusts them with higher clearance than basically any other company in the data/AI world.\n\nTheir software does have certain predictive capabilities but its their customers who get the predictions not Palantir. And I think it's only predictive in a soft semantical sense. I think it's predictive in like their software better integrates data from hundreds of data points and knows how to align those data points to find clear relationships like when a part on an engine is likely to go bad they can better tell what that exact window is so its \"more predictive\" than what the capabilities were without Foundry or Palantirs Apollo AI platform.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}
