Technical Analysis - watch for resistance points where the stock has hit a price ceiling and has come down again and again, unable to break that price point, even in a hot market. Look for the RSI indicator being overbought at that point as that is often the signal others are using to get out of the trade. Then check how fast the price came down once it hit the resistance.

{"title": "A near-term pullback, then the third bubble in 100 years is coming, says strategist. Here’s how to get ready", "selftext": "Of the dozens of central bank meetings crammed into this week, the Federal Reserve is seen stealing the show with a tapering start and possible early rate-hike hints. After the “worst inflation call in history” and its credibility shattered, Chair Jerome Powell will need to take the reins hard, says Allianz’s chief adviser Mohamed El-Erian. So we’ll see if a potentially sterner Fed knocks the S&P 500, which glided to a new high on Friday despite nosebleed consumer prices, off the Santa rally path.\n\nOn to our call of the day from a team at Stifel, led by Barry Bannister, warning of another bubble for the ages, thanks to “poor monetary and fiscal decisions since COVID-19.” And maybe enjoy any Santa rally while it lasts, as the team sees a near-term correction taking the S&P 500 toward the low 4,000s by the first quarter of next year. And then…“Later in 2022-23E, we believe the ‘behind-the-curve’ Fed might create the third bubble in 100 years, by 2023 to 6,750 for the S&P 500 (Nasdaq \\[approximately\\] 25,000),” said the Stifel team.\n\n“Populism (which the Fed and Treasury seemingly embrace) leads to poor choices and even worse outcomes. Rate repression may again create a bubble that bursts (always do), followed by a lost decade,” it said. It said investors should look to history for proof this can happen. The S&P 500 dropped nearly 20% in the third quarter of 1998 before the dot-com bubble burst in 1999-2000. A “late arriving” Fed tightening from the second-half of 1999 to the first half of the next year couldn’t stop it, said Bannister and the team.\n\n“The same happened in the Roaring ’20s, with a -10.7% mid\\_Dec-1928 drop as rates rose before the Oct.-1929 crash,” the strategists added. The only way to prevent such a bubble would be for the Fed to heed its own financial stability report, where it warned over elevated risk appetite among retail investors and high equity and real estate valuations, and “tilt hawkish.”\n\n“Still, policy may arrive too late, and if the market goes ‘risk-on’ with a falling Equity Risk Premium and if the 10Y Treasury Inflation Protected Security (TIPS) yield remains repressed at -1.0% due to global central banks, a P/E \\[price-earnings\\] convexity bubble in 2022-2023E may occur,” they said.\n\nWhile the big one may be a way off, they offer a near-term survival guide. Bannister and his team said if both the S&P 500 and commodities weaken simultaneously — they expect that due to dollar strength, a China growth slowdown, Fed exit signals and tighter global liquidity —investors can take refuge in S&P 500 defensives. So healthcare, consumer staples, utilities and telecommunications are the safety spots of choice, for now.\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/expect-a-near-term-stock-pullback-then-a-bubble-not-seen-in-100-years-heres-how-to-start-preparing-11639398418?mod=home-page](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/expect-a-near-term-stock-pullback-then-a-bubble-not-seen-in-100-years-heres-how-to-start-preparing-11639398418?mod=home-page)", "id": "rfgy5o", "created_utc": 1639405733.0, "score": 59, "upvote_ratio": 0.68, "num_comments": 83, "comments": [{"body": "Lol all that to end with “healthcare, consumer staples, utilities, and telecommunications”. \n\nIf you’re worrying about what to do, evaluate all your non-index fund picks.

It means that higher rates will be the trend with higher stock prices and higher home prices and higher inflation.  As inflation rises further then yes the fed will try to fight inflation using rate increases but in doing so they will blow up government budgets .\nWe the consumer already pay high interest on our credit cards ...\nNov 18, 2021 — The average credit card interest rate is 18.24% for new offers and 14.54%\nThat was just a quick copy and paste and I do understand some juggle credit cards to keep the rate down and others ( myself included ) pay the debt off each month ( most of the time ) to keep the rate at zero .\nThe fed should be independent and that is how it's supposed to work but in the USA we are becoming a political economy and therefore the fed is becoming less independent ( in my opinion ) \nAll that said .\nTake a look at the 30 yr or even 10 yr treasury and compare it to the stock market and show me how often the markets have Fallen as rates went down ( not a typo ) \nAnd also notice how many times rates have risen with stock prices.  Just look at the past 21 years . \nI understand the arguments that from 1980 to date interest rates have been in a down trend. \nOn another note look at interest rates from 1970 to 1980 and compare that to you price of gold as well as home prices . \nThe general consensus just doesn't fit with what the markets have actually done in the past .\nInflation they say is at 6.8 \n\n\nAnnual inflation rate in the US accelerated to 6.8% in November of 2021, the highest since June of 1982, and in line with forecasts.\nWhere were interest rates in 1982 ? \nThis is not a zero sum situation .\nJust my understanding mind you .
