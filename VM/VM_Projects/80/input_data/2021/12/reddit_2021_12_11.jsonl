being said, i am bullish on semis overall, just gotta know which ones to pick and when   \npersonally i'm bullish on TSM  and AMD, per reasons above and as they are being put in everything to power many things due to silicon scarcity they offer very good AIO chips that have half decent graphics performance all on same die\n\ni'm also bullish Samsung but i can't invest in them as i'm not KR citizen \n\nand i'm also bullish ASML just because their hardware is what's needed to produce these chips in the first place\n\nand i'm bearish on INTC overall, [although they are trying to get pork from the CHIPS bill but the irony is it would just be taking tax dollars to send chips to be made in a fab they have in Chengdu, China](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-13/white-house-spurns-intel-plan-to-boost-chip-production-in-china) and [due to the problems they've had in the past with

these short term catalysts events bring before i go back long into these\n\nall this being stated, i do believe some of these semi companies are a bit frothy via being pumped up via options, if your goal is short term plays or gains, then semis might need to cool off a bit first\n\nhowever if your goal is to just get into these companies for future growth, then they are all fine companies, some
