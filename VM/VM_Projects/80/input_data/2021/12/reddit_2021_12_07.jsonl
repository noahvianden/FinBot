But the stock is trading at $82 means it's worth $82 because the market has factored in various risks.  At least that's what the efficient market hypothesis would say.  Maybe people are just dumb and should be buying the stock up until it's $97.\n\nAlso, exercising your options isn't the best move if they still have much time left.  You should always be able to sell them for more than the amount they are in-the-money.  Like it your strike price is 77.5 and the current price is 82.5, you're making $5 per share.
