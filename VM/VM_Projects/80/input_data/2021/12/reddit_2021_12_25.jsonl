But the Model 3 was announced, I saw the webcast and I decided then and there I wanted that car. So I reserved it, but being in Europe I knew it was going to be a long wait. I got myself a charger when we remodelled the garden, and having a charger bought a Hyundai Ioniq electric as a second car. Finally late March 2019 my Tesla arrived, one of the first in Europe. After driving it for less than a month I opened an investor account to buy shares, since it was clear to me that this was revolutionary.

I won’t begrudge her as she got as much skin in the game as I do and trading can be tricky but it enabled us to increase our Tesla holdings quite substantially which we would not have been able to do otherwise.

I hear this thing from multiple sources (latest is Chicken Genius Singapore).  \nTo my understanding, you use your total share value at the moment to borrow money from your broker (?) and use them to live instead of selling shares (thus lowering their total value). Being them borrowed money, you don't have to pay taxes on them (nor you have to pay taxes on your unsold shares). Basically, you have \"free money\" that are not taxable, that you can use however you want. Am I right until this point?  \nBUT, what I still do not understand is: how am I supposed to repay the money I borrowed, since I am going to use them to live?   \nMaybe my 532 shares are not enough to perform this kind of action, but I am interested in exploring the option for my future... thanks", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": ">  BUT, what I still do not understand is: how am I supposed to repay the money I borrowed, since I am going to use them to live?\n\nThe other party of that arrangement is not interested in actual repayment, only in repayment ability.

What happens to your loans and shares and interest when you die is somewhat complicated.

If you've got a billion dollars in stock, and need a few million to live the rest of the life, then it's easy to borrow it. But if you actually want to spend most of that billion dollars, you're going to need to sell because you need to put up way more in collateral than the amount you borrow.\n\nAvoiding estate taxes is real problem in the US, and taking out loans is part of that problem.
