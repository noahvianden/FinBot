{"title": "Ford is the Apple of the car industry.", "selftext": "I’ve seen it said a few times that Tesla is the “apple of the car industry” and while no such thing exists(no automaker will ever organically match Apple’s divine profit margin) if there was an “apple of the car industry” it would be Ford. \n\nThe reason being that, while Tesla has a lot of brand recognition within the EV space, if EVs are going to takeover(as they would have to for Tesla to even approach being worth what it currently trades at) then the EV industry will simply be the car industry, with the gas/diesel segment being the niche component. This transition will make Ford king. \n\nBranding:\n\nAlthough teslas upside down penis has made great strides in recent years, the blue oval itself is a brand Americans know and love, and their individual products also represent some of the most powerful brands in the car industry. If the iPhone is the king of smartphones, then who is the king of trucks? The f150. Just like the iPhone, there’s other offerings, some arguably better and cheaper than the f150, but in terms of brand and market recognition f150 is the top dog. Same story with the Mustang and to a lesser extent the Explorer. All you have to do is look at the bronco sport to see the power of branding in the automotive industry. It’s a rebadged Ford Escape with new stamping yet it sells like hot cakes because it shares a name with the traditional bronco. Don’t underestimate the power of Ford’s brands.\n \nProduct:\n\nNow, let’s talk product. I am from Tennessee, and around here it’s somewhat popular to make jokes at the expense of electric cars. But I think once the F150 lighting is on the road it’s going to put the kibosh on that. If the Lightning does everything they say it’ll do at the price point they’re advertising now, it’ll be a juggernaut, and since it isn’t a door Tesla’s douche-mobile cybertruck won’t be able to stop it. You simply can’t argue with a vehicle that hauls ass like a sports car and hauls junk like a truck.\n\nAnd Fords gas cars aren’t anything to sleaze at either. The new Bronco took Jeep behind the barn in record time and their only response is an overpriced, 12mpg box on wheels to compete with the expedition/navigator. Also, they’re slowly but surely rebuilding the Lincoln brand with great interiors and attractive exterior styling. After what they were putting out pre-2017, it’ll take a while to reposition themselves but they will do it if they consistently invest in the brand as they have been. Meanwhile, the normal F150 continues to print money. \n\nThe issues:\n\nIt’s often that people who are fans of a particular car manufacturer will fail to acknowledge any possible flaw in their pick, but obviously Ford isn’t perfect. Their main two issues are dealerships and unions. I think at some point they will bite the bullet and start aggressively fighting to get rid of the dealerships. They’ll never lose the unions obviously but it’s only a matter of time before Tesla starts dealing with them and then Ford will be competitive on price or even be able to beat Telsa.\n\nTLDR: be a boomer. buy Ford stock. embrace it.

He's the son of Neil Armstrong (first man on the moon) and cousin to Billie Joe Armstrong (Green Day).  $COIN is the largest code currency exchange in the United States by trading volume.\n\n**Who uses Coinbase?**\n\nCoinbase is in 100+ countries, and they have over 73 million verified users. Last quarter, Retail Monthly Transacting Users (MTUs) was at 7.4M.  They have $255B of assets on the platform.  Compare to RH, 22.4M funded accounts and $95B of assets on the platform.\n\n**How do they make money?**\n\nLast quarter they had $1.235B in net revenue, including $1.1B from transactions and $145M in subscription & services revenue.  The transactions revenue is really driven by code currency volatility, but the services revenue is sticky and fast growing.\n\n**What does the future have in store for Coinbase?**\n\n* Coinbase will be a hodler of non-fiat currency.  In August, they announced plans to purchase $500 million in non-fiat currency and use 10% of their profits to purchase more non-fiat currency in the future.\n* Coinbase NFT, a peer-to-peer marketplace that will make minting, purchasing, showcasing, and discovering NFTs easier than ever. They have over 1.8 million users on the waitlist to join.  [https://www.coinbase.com/nft/announce](https://www.coinbase.com/nft/announce)\n* Coinbase issued $2B in debt at <4% APR for product development and potential M&A\n* They announced a partnership with Facebook. They will be store non-fiat currency for Facebook's new digital wallet, Novi, which will enable users to send and receive money abroad instantly, securely and with no fees.

Sell puts!** \n\n* Oppenheimer’s Owen Lau rates Coinbase as an Outperform with a $444 price target.\n* Lisa Ellis, MoffettNathanson Senior Equity Analyst, re-iterated her $600 PT on Coinbase.\n* Josh Brown likes it.  Kevin O'Leary likes it.  Bryn Talkington likes it.\n\nWhy wouldn't they?
