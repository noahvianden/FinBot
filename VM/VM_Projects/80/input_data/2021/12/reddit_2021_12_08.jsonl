If you actually know the business & market some of the analysis behind the price targets can be laughably awful. \n\nCase in point, around a year ago I read one report by a bearish Tesla analyst who was so clueless that it made me wonder if he even bothered to check what prices Tesla was charging for their vehicles. The analyst said that the Porsche Taycan would cause Tesla's Model 3 sales to plummet, even though the Model S was clearly the vehicle that the Taycan was competing against based solely on the prices.

That Tesla will have higher output than the other manufacturers, that their tech will be better.\n\nBut making cars is a low margin business insofar. Tesla could sell literally every car on the planet and I‚Äôd still be wondering how they are going to earn enough money to justify the valuation. \n\nThey have to have another way to make money.
