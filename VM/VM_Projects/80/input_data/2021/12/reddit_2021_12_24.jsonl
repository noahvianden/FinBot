{"title": "How viable are publicly traded COUNTRIES?", "selftext": "This may sound preposterous, but it is has not only been done before but is almost in place right now. And it's theoretical implications are interesting to say the least.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bqy3y6nb9g781.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6ae41a42efcc90a8d8ad4a806417969158b1405\n\nBEHOLD the Dutch East India Company, the stock that existed before industrialization but had a greater market cap twice that of Tesla. Oversimplifying a lot, this stock was first sold by contractors working for the Dutch government to set up colonies and trade routes in Asia. This proved massively profitable and they got more and more contracts as the Dutch Republic became a colonial empire. For two centuries there was this state of affairs where about half a percent of the world's population were employees of this one corporation, and many of the innovations and norms you see in the corporate world now originated with these guys. In 1799 the Dutch government bought out the shares, nationalizing the company.\n\nThis stock was also the subject of the first \"short and distort\" scheme, where a disgraced employee sought revenge, so he would frequent social media and troll... Pardon me, I mean he'd visit taverns and spread false rumors among his friends. These taverns are also where he met people willing to lend him shares for to sell short. Eventually he was busted, but nothing of what he did was illegal at the time. Instead, he was banned from trading securities and short selling was banned in the Dutch Republic.\n\nTo this day there's a long list of public companies where a government is the majority stakeholder. Frankly, most of these are in former Communist states where state ventures were privatized in part. These include about half of the large caps from eastern Europe which were bought out in chunks by private persons but remained mostly state owned. There's also a huge list of Chinese ventures in which the government and/or party members own any number of shares. The national bank of Switzerland is also public, and the state of Lower Saxony owns a big chunk of Volkswagon among many other local oddities.\n\nWhy would you take a country public? Well, stock sales are just a form of debt that shifts all the debt onto the lenders. And we all know how governments love to borrow.\n\nBut just running through some hypotheticals, what sort of market caps, dividends, and PE ratios would countries have? Many developed nations could trade at very high PE ratios with tiny dividends because like their bonds their stocks are very safe and only the end of the world would crash them. But even by using corporate type numbers the theoretical numbers are mind boggling. The US could easily have a market cap of 100 trillion dollars, giving it a PE ratio of 25-30, and any dividend at all would ensure a steady stream of long-term buyers.\n\nI know what you're thinking, though. In a world where people buy puts on SPY, where Turks burn dollars because they're mad at their own inflation (HINT: that doesn't work), where politicians are sanctioned by rival governments, where trade wars happen, and where political propaganda is ubiquitous... What sort of shenanigans would there be surrounding these stocks?\n\nFirst, I'm sure some governments would not only pump their own stock but require partners/allies, citizens to buy it. Second, some idiots in high places might blow their country's budget trying to destroy their rivals by taking massive short positions. It wouldn't work, but it sure would be fun to watch.\n\nI'm sure that after elections, the options on many countries would trade at significant premiums as people hedge against risks that don't exist or make leveraged bets on the deluded belief a new fool in charge would cause immediate good/bad change to the entire nation's fortunes. Also, nations punitively delisting each other is pretty much inevitable, but in some places being attacked by a mob for owning the wrong stocks is a significant possibility.\n\nI figure that right now this isn't a thing... Simply because it sounds exotic. I know where I'm from if anyone preposed this their political rivals would immediately (and baselessly) conclude it was a massive pump and dump. But really, a nation's stock is simply a riskier version of their bonds. Pretty safe investment, and option volumes would be high enough for dailies (and all the insanity that implies).", "id": "rnhrwz", "created_utc": 1640334008.0, "score": 38, "upvote_ratio": 0.7, "num_comments": 81, "comments": [{"body": "Puts on Zimbabwe 🇿🇼", "score": 61, "replies": [{"body": "and Turkey", "score": 27, "replies": [{"body": "and Venezuela", "score": 23, "replies": [{"body": "and Argentina", "score": 17, "replies": [{"body": "🎶 Don't cry for me Argentinaaaaa 🎶", "score": 10, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Puts on Maduro's diet and moustache", "score": 5, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Puts on Turkey gobl gobl 🇹🇷🦃", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "Every year like clockwork...", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "fun fact, did you know the turkey is named after the country. in the 1400's Turkey exported birds called ' turkey fowls'  and when settles came to the us they saw the turkey and went: hey that looks like a turkey fowl!", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Puts ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4887) on North Korea and Libya.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "A for-profit corporation has a responsibility to its shareholders to produce profits.
