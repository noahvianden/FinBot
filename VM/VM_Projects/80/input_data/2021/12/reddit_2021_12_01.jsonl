Very low growth, essentially forever. Massive and widening wealth gap bordering on neo-feudalism. Zombie corporations propped by cheap debt roam the US landscape, eating the brains of all domestic competitors. US companies get crushed by more nimble foreign competitors abroad. Stagnation and decay.\n\n\nHow to financially prepare for these scenarios? Fuck if I know, what works in one fails in another.
