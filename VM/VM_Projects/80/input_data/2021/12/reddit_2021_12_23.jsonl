How much money would I make in what period of time, assuming everything worked out?\n\nI can tell you that right now, my current strategy with this NVDA investment is to hold it till about $322, and then possibly sell it, with an idea of getting back in on a dip, if possible. If I can't get back in on a dip, because NVDA went on a run, then I'd probably look at one of my other favorite tickers to put the $$$ into on a dip. I expect Nvidia at some point next week to possibly touch $322. Although I know that this will only happen if the market is mostly rallying next week. Which may or may not happen. I'm hoping for the Santa Claus rally that we always hear about. Last several trading days of December and first two trading days of January. Let's just say for the sake of argument that on Friday December 31st, NVDA hits $322.42 and I jump out of the stock.

If the options are worth $10 ($1,000 as options are priced in per share amounts, and contracts are traditionally 100 shares). \n\nYou get a bid, and you successfully sell and immediately get $1,000 from the sale. You now have to hold the 100 shares until at least that expiration date, unless the option is assigned earlier than expiration.\n\nIf the price only goes to $321.99 or below, you keep your shares, you keep your premium (pretty much the best case scenario). You chest the market\"\n\nIf the stock goes to $325, you keep your $1,000 in premium, but sell the stock at $322 (the strike price). But, you still made $700 more than if you just sold at $325, due to the premium ($1,000 premium - $300 from contract execution). You still \"best the market\"\n\nThe only scenario in which you're really worse off is if the shares end up trading at $332+, since your $1,000 in premium is now less than the difference in market value and your strike price, since you would be forced to sell at $322.
