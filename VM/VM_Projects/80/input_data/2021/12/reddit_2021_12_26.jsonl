Since 2008, the developed world in general and the U.S, in particular has been in an artificial state:  The central banks have monetized trillions of dollars of govt debt annually, which drove borrowing costs to near zero (on an inflation adjusted basis actually made borrowing profitable).  Corps loaded up on debt and bought back their own shares (which was essentially illegal prior to SEC rule change in the '90's).  The 2008-current bull market is not driven by a growing economy.  It is the result of Central Bank driven liquidity.  The Fed has been forthright in saying they are taking away the liquidity.  Security prices are set at the margin.  When sentiment turns negative, buyers go away.  To sell a share or an option will require fire sale discounts.\n\nAmazon is a long way from being a value play.  EPS $55/share, PE 65, Revenue growth 15%, PEG 2.7, PS 3.8.  Those numbers are nutty but still OK when the FED is flooding the system with liquidity but they will not hold up when liquidity is withdrawn.
