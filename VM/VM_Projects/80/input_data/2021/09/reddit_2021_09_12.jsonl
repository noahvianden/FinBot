Earnings from Oracle, Fuelcell.", "selftext": "**The Broader Markets**\n\nLast Week – SPY was down about 1.7% last week, more than the 0.8% expected move options were pricing.\n\n**This Week – SPY** options are pricing a 1.5% move (in either direction) for the upcoming week. With the SPY around $445 that corresponds to about **$438** as a *bearish expected move* and **$452** as a *bullish expected move*.\n\n**Implied Volatility** – The VIX was higher on the week and ended Friday at about 21, up from 16.50 to start last week. It is now higher than its historical average. December VIX futures are about 23, higher than last week.\n\n**Expected Moves for This Week**\n\nThe major ETFs are all pricing larger moves for this week than they did last week:\n\n* SPY **1.5%**\n* QQQ **1.6%**\n* IWM **2.3%**\n* DIA **1.5%**\n\nThe 1.5% expected move in the SPY is higher than the historical average. An Iron Condor with short strikes set at the expected move (based on the close Friday), needs the ETF to finish between $438 and $452 to see Max Gain.

Overall volatility was quite low to end the Summer and was awakened last week by the string of down days in the market. IV has spiked (a little) and is now pricing in market moves similar to the move we saw last week.
