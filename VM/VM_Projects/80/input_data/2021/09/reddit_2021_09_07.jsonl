{"title": "THE WORLD IS HUNGRY FOR CHIPS - Undervalued Semiconductor Play - HIMX", "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\n**CHIIIIIPPPPPPSSSSS - NOM NOM**\n\nGood morning ladies and gents. Lets talk about chips - semiconductors to be exact. If you have tried to purchase a car or refrigerator in the past few months you've noticed that either the price has increased or they are on backorder.\n\nUnfortunately, everything from your car's dashboard to your dragon shaped dildo now requires a computer chip. Because of this all this, the semiconductor/chip stocks have been shooting straight up (**AMD, TSM, NVDA**). Their valuations are high, but this is rightfully so since the semiconductor shortage is theoretically going to last until 2023 according to analysts (1). This is where **HIMX** enters the building.\n\n**HIMX** is a fabless semiconductor provider. They create a multitude of design solutions for visual displays (TV's, Laptops, mobile phones, car navigation, VR devices) as well as a whole host of additional products such as silicon IP's and LCOS micro displays for automotive HUD. The company is based in Taiwan, and has been chugging along during the pandemic, increasing their quarterly revenue growth by an impressive 95.5% yoy. It's quarterly earnings have beaten expectations during the last two quarters, but due to the China FUD and being located in Taiwan it's become risky for investors.\n\n**BEARISH POINTS**\n\nSo let me lay out the bear case before I start pumping the bull argument. There is a legitimate fear that China will eventually completely control Taiwan and impose the same tariffs that already exist for mainland China. This would drastically hurt business with the West, from which HIMX draws a large portion of it's customer base. Taiwan's position is that as long as they keep making semiconductors, they are important to the West, and we will protect them. At the moment, that's still the case, and looks like that will continue to be the case for the next few years.\n\nFrom a technical aspect this company is being shorted heavily. The put/call ratio is 1.34, the short interest on Aug 13th was 10.35%, and the short ratio everyday since Aug 13th has increased dramatically.\n\nSo if you think China doesn't plan to start WWIII, please keep reading.\n\n**BULLISH POINTS**\n\nThe bullish argument is that you have a company creating a product that is in high demand, and will continue to be in high demand in the near future. **TSM** has raised the prices of their semiconductors by 10% within the past month, it's likely that **HIMX** will follow suit. There are two opportunities for them to make this announcement within this week: Sept 6-7th dbAccess IAA Cars Virtual Conference 2021 and Sept 6-10th 22nd Credit Suisse Asian Technology Conference (2).\n\nWhen **HIMX** P/E is compared to other semiconductor stocks, it's much lower (Trailing P/E 9.94 vs. 32.55 for **TSM**). Within the past month the price action has pushed **HIMX** back down to the 200SMA, which it has been grinding along for the past week. The price action appears to be consolidating against the 200SMA which suggests a big move in either direction. According to FinTel the short borrow fee rate jumped from 0.7% to 1.86% on Sep 3rd. The number of shares available to borrow has been steadily decreasing within the past two weeks while the price has begun to stagnate. It appears HIMX is going to make a decent sized move soon, and with analysts suggesting a low PT of 19 and high 23.50, it's only a matter of time until this puppy pops (3).\n\nPositions:\n\n40x $13 10/15\n\nI had references to the little numbers in parenthesis, but WSB hates links, so I'm going to see if this gets through then I'll post them in the comments.

The semiconductor industry continues to go through a severe foundry shortage, especially in the mature process nodes where we are mainly anchored. With foundries running at more than full capacity while demand shows no indication of abating, the longlasting unaddressed supply-demand imbalance remains. In view of the foundry shortage and anticipated growing demand for the foreseeable future, we have entered into strategic agreements with foundry partners to cover both our short-term and long-term needs.\n\n> We are in the process of entering into further such agreements as we speak, with some of them involving new foundry partners, leaving nothing untried to expand our capacity pool. Likewise, across various product lines, we are entering into strategic agreements with customers who wish to secure their IC supplies. Some of them are indirect customers who don‚Äôt necessarily source ICs directly from us but still wish to enter into supply deals with us to ensure that their direct vendors, mostly panel makers in our case, will get their desired supply quantities from us.\n\n> All such contractual arrangements will help boost our future growth prospects and improve earnings visibility. \n\n> Notwithstanding all these efforts, demand continues to outpace supply and we believe the imbalance could last well into 2022.
