(Scroll to bottom for TLDR)\n\nSo when TSLA went onto the market my dad, through some kind of genius/luck, took my $1500 that I had saved up in birthday money/parents had put away for me over the years and bought me shares of TSLA. \n\nTo this day, he has held every single share that he bought for me, and I have also held every share since turning 18 and gaining control over my shares.\n\nMy dad isn’t crazy rich so I have never grew up around this amount of money and it is surreal to know that I have this much under my thumb.\n\nNow remember, this was within the first months of TSLA being brought to market so I obviously have a VERY low entry point.  In addition, the stock split also treated my shares quite nicely as one can tell.\n\nI have been researching options for a while and was typical WSB degen until I inevitably lost the money I put up.\n\nI then began researching selling calls/outs and have amassed some knowledge on theta gang strategies.\n\nHowever, I am honestly lost at what to do with these shares.  Is it worth selling calls/puts?  Should I sell some offend start selling cals on other stocks?  Basically, I just wanted to ask the community what would they do if they were in my situation?\n\nTLDR; College sophmore with 200 shares of TSLA asking WWYD if you were in my position and wanted to maximize Theta gang gains?", "id": "pnxqaj", "created_utc": 1631602693.0, "score": 24, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 85, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 114, "replies": [{"body": "This is the official thetagang answer.", "score": 59, "replies": [{"body": "It’s also the right answer.", "score": 20, "replies": []}, {"body": "Big brain answer is sell covered strangles\n\nCould even sell only 1 put, if assigned sell ATM calls and mark your newest share lot to be taken (or call the broker to do it)", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Yep, with the extra 70k they have lying around.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "What would he need 70K for?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Do you not need enough available cash to buy shares at strike when you sell a put?
