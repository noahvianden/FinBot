They have all these unbanked people theyâ€™re not allowed to bank because of kyc rules. Basically like 40% of their population was born at home and completely undocumented so banks wonâ€™t ever open accounts for any of them due to anti money laundering and kyc rules. So their President said fuck it weâ€™ll use magic Internet money to get around that since magic Internet money doesnâ€™t care if you have ID. Plus theyâ€™ll basically get a pretty legit GDP boost solely from remittances not having 10% taken by Western Union and the like.\n\nHonestly it seems crackpot from the outside but it actually solves a lot of the issues holding their nation back from modernizing their financial system so this guy just said fuck it and went for it.
