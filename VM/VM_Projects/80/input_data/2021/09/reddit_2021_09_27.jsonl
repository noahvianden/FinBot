{"title": "$BRK.B's intrinsic value is over $420.69 per share. I thought it was $330 and opened a call spread, but the more I dug the more undervalued it looked. Calls are cheap too. What am I missing?", "selftext": "Berkshire is the most misunderstood mega cap, despite Buffett laying out how it works repeatedly and in detail. Berkshire analysts either analyze every piece of the company to derive a sum of the parts valuation or do a historical comparison to how the company traded at an average of 1.5x premium to book value and how Buffett himself will buy back shares if it goes under 1.3x. The first method ignores the forest for the trees, because the whole is much greater than the sum of its parts. The second method is just lazy and incorrect--why use a market-dependent metric or the valuation that's so low that Buffett himself would buy it over other opportunities in the market? Neither of these is the correct way to value Berkshire.\n\nFirst, let's look at the investment portfolio. This component of Berkshire is not just a proxy for the stocks that it contains. This pool of liquid stocks is actively managed by the best investors in the world at no fee to you. Not only do they find great stocks to hold, but they also know when to sell them. And they always BTFD when they should. They have compounded Berkshire's insurance float (near-permanent pool of cash that Berkshire is paid to hold), its free cash flow, and its debt at a rate faster than the S&P 500 over any 10 year period. That gives shareholders quantifiable value far beyond the market value of Berkshire's portfolio. The best way to quantify that value is to discount its excess returns to the present. Side note: capital gains taxes do not need to be deducted from portfolio value because Berkshire defers them indefinitely if feasible and manages their capital gains tax bill to be less than half of free cash flow from operations in any given year. Since they are always buying and selling, capital gains taxes are built into their income tax line and its growth over time.\n\nSecond, let's see the interplay between Berkshire's insurance float vs actual debt and how they increase Berkshire's ability to return capital to shareholders. Berkshire has a huge, ever-growing pile of cash called insurance float that it is (on average) paid to hold by its insurance businesses. They actually carry this cash on the liabilities side of the balance sheet even though it is always growing, they owe it back to no one, and they get paid to hold it. What's more interesting is that this wonderful float is growing faster than their actual debt, and both are growing slower than the assets of the company. These asymmetric growth relationships between the float, debt, and overall assets, mean that Berkshire can use debt or float to return growing capital to shareholders while reducing its debt ratios! This is a source of return separate from free cash flows from operations or portfolio growth.\n\nThird, we have Berkshire's reinvestment in the operations and tack-on acquisitions of its operating companies vs how this compounding is treated on the balance sheet. Every dollar Berkshire gets to reinvest into these world-class businesses gets used intelligently, accelerates free cash flow growth, and increases the size of Berkshire's private empire. However, all these businesses and the reinvestments into them are carried at-cost and minus depletion on Berkshire's balance sheet. The businesses are growing, making exponentially more money, but their balance sheet value is constant or diminishing. This growing disparity between accounting vs reality means that the carrying value of these businesses and their expanding operations is carried at a diminishing fraction vs its true value on Berkshire's balance sheet. This is the strongest argument against using a multiple of book value to value Berkshire.\n\nTo quantify and value these overlooked qualities of Berkshire, I came up with what I call Tangible Return, which is free cash flow minus income tax, plus net equity portfolio growth, and plus debt growth. I used debt growth in lieu of float growth as a more conservative measure, since float grows faster than debt. They both represent the excess capacity Berkshire has to return capital to shareholders above and beyond free cash flow and equity portfolio growth while reducing debt ratios. Anyway, here are the numbers for the last 10 years:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[2011 - 2020 Growth of Berkshire Hathaway](https://preview.redd.it/bre04g1bryp71.png?width=1033&format=png&auto=webp&s=3999bc899d83f50d3a4306918bc1314fb8adb1ab)\n\nBased on the CAGR of these growth metrics, I projected a conservative future for Berkshire for the next 80+ years. I reduced all the trailing 10 year CAGR's by 33% from the start and kept reducing them by 33% every 9-10 years to account for diminishing returns to scale. I wasn't more aggressive with reducing the CAGRs for scale limitations because Berkshire was already quite large during the 10 year period I used to derive the growth rates. In addition, the growth rates I used are not much different than macro trends like S&P 500 growth and GDP growth. The macro trends should be lower given Berkshire's entire business model is to beat them with better moats and profitable/uncallable leverage. Also, I used a discount rate of 8% due to the diversification, stability, and predictability of Berkshire vs the average S&P 500 company. Here are the numbers for the next 11 years:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[2021 & Beyond Projected Growth and Valuation of Berkshire Hathaway](https://preview.redd.it/lnlxidmeryp71.png?width=1121&format=png&auto=webp&s=daf5c5288f152f2293638bae3e86f7be2e2bf5db)\n\nAt first I was shocked to see that this analysis yielded a valuation over $1 Trillion, but the numbers, assumptions, and calculations all make sense to me. We're approaching an era for Berkshire that bears out the disparity between how analysts have valued the company vs how the BRK machine actually works. We are overdue for a rotation to stocks viewed as \"value\" according to [this](https://www.researchaffiliates.com/en_us/publications/articles/842-did-i-miss-the-value-turn.html) report published by Research Affiliates on 9/21/21. Moreover, the disparity of how BRK is valued vs how it actually works is only exaggerated by the $20+ billion per year of share repurchases. Now those repurchases make a lot more sense. Buffett is buying one dollar for 54 cents!\n\nTL;DR: $BRK.B trades at $277.87 but is actually worth $523.15. If we apply a \\~20% margin of safety, we get $420.69.

{"title": "Top 10 Short Analysis and Big & Safe Moves for October: $ROOT and others", "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI would like to share my ongoing DD on high short interest stocks, methodology, and conservative but high ROI plays moving into October. It's exhausting now as everything now is considered a \"short squeeze\" but I would like shed some light on relatively safe plays and reasoning behind it. This methodology will always change based on data presented. The #1 rule in this is that you don't want to chase on plays that are being run. What I do for myself is to get in plays based on data/method that are not running (pre-squeeze), scale into the stock, wait for the catalysts, and then scale out of the stock once it starts running. See below:\n\nMethodology/Criteria:\n\n1. I am looking at high short interest stocks on MarketWatch and HighShortInterestStocks continuously for the top 10 tickers (you can find these sites via Google and make sure to look at it continuously!). S3 has good information but I don't pay for the data.\n2. Market cap over $1.5B per WSB rules but you can use this methodology to find other smaller cap plays yourself outside of WSB. ($ROOT, $NKLA, $GOEV, and $SDC are the only stocks in the Top 10 lists that have >$1.5B market cap).\n3. I look for the following requirements (STRICT) and they must all be present at any given time.\n\na. The first requirement is the stock must be close to a 52 week low or close/below the 200 MA- you can also follow the YTD Change %. You want to make sure you are buying value and not stocks that are down because they are truly terrible companies.\n\nb. The second requirement is the stock must have catalysts in the short term horizon- this allows for anticipation of upside and call option flow. The most % of money I ever made was purchasing stocks/calls in their pre-squeeze stage before they actually squeezed. This way you don't get IV crushed while chasing but as the IV builds, you gain massively on calls. If you are purchasing calls when the IV is at or less than 90% and a catalyst hits that takes the IV >130%, these are massive gains.\n\nc. The third requirement is that the stock float must be shorted >30%. Low float stocks aren't a requirement although they help in certain situations.\n\nd. The 4th requirement are technicals. The one set up I always play is a falling wedge as long as it meets the requirements above. I also love playing cup and handles and bull flags as they are the most consistent. I do not play symmetrical triangles or wedges- I feel as though these are more unpredictable.\n\ne. The other dataset that I look at are call/put ratio and open interest on call options. This can tell you how bullish or bearish generally the market is for the future. A large amount of OI on calls means people are anticipating something significant.\n\n4) Scale In with stock/call purchases based on risk/reward ratio. Make sure to SCALE IN. This doesn't mean purchasing all at one time. I usually purchase not in time increments but in % decrease increments (on average -5%) to be safe and purchase 90% stock / 10% calls (>3 months out) to scale in below based on my own risk management. If I want to go riskier/higher reward, I will increase the amount of calls or shorten the call expiration date. But I strongly advise purchasing calls >3 month out exp.\n\ni.e. Day 1: 90% stock / 10% calls (20% of capital) and then repeat when the stock price drops 5%. If the stock price jumps, I don't scale up as many might do. I just move onto another play. Holding CASH is always a position.\n\n5) Once the catalyst hits or there is upside to the stock, I scale out of my positions/gains (not all at one time). Make sure you follow volume - if the volume is strong, you can hold onto your positions much longer to get maximum ROI.\n\n6) Rinse, repeat, and share with others on your plays.\n\nThe stock that I am most interested in right now is $ROOT and I've evaluated the others- please feel free to drop in comments what you would like for me to evaluate. Right now it is the #4 most shorted stock on MarketWatch and HighShortInterestStocks. I will let you know my thoughts on the others in the comments thread and why $ROOT is better vs. others like $SDC. I do look at basic fundamentals to help my game and I do see that $ROOT has $1B in cash while trading at a market cap of $1.5B. They do have a catalyst on the horizon which is their Carvana partnership launch date, other insurance programs such as home insurace, etc. (haven't gotten hit by negative news except earnings), and for a reach, partnerships with electrical vehicle companies like $TSLA. The fact is that only telematics can truly determine how electric vehicle drivers drive instead of their credit scores, etc. and it's very difficult in getting insurance state by state. Short Interest is at 35%. Technically, they are in a falling wedge with it getting tighter- this is when I like to go riskier on calls as you could see a significant breakout. Let me know your thoughts and I will answer questions that you may have!\n\n\\*Edit 1: Hypothetically taking a position at $5.67/share price and March $7.5 2022 calls at $1.30 as of 9/27/21.
