{"title": "$NNDM - May literally 3D Print Solid Returns", "selftext": "Nano Dimension $NNDM\n\nCompany Description (From their website)\n\nNano Dimension Ltd. engages in the provision of intelligent machines for the fabrication of additively manufactured electronics. Its products and services include DragonFly Pro System, conductive and insulating inks for printed electronics, and optimized multi-material design of complex electronics.\n\n**Sounds cool, doesn't it?** Anyways, here's some information on the company and some short term catalysts.\n\n**Where They Can Sell**\n\nIn several investor phone calls the past few months by CEO Yoav Stern, he has stated SEVERAL times that the companies deals with companies in the Defense sector. What they produce with these machines (3d printed ELECTRONIC devices) can be used in many various sectors, like defense, medical, aerospace, etc. Most recently, in March, a RF circuit board printed by them was sent to the International Space Station.\n\n**Cathie Wood**\n\nShe is obsessed with Nano Dimension. Nano Dimension is in FOUR Ark ETFS. (\\* as of 4/30/21) Over 16 million shares she owns.\n\nARKQ (8,425,766 Shares)\n\nARKW (5,383,591 Shares)\n\nIZRL (789,242 Shares)\n\nPRNT (1,934,283 Shares)\n\n**Revenue**\n\nIt's a speculative stock as of now, so the numbers are not very pleasing.\n\nIn 2020, their total revenue was just $3.4 million, with $48.49 million in losses.\n\nIn pre-covid times, 2019, their revenue was $7 million. Flash forward two years, with a bunch of cash on hand (explained below) and hopefully as COVID subsides, I'm expecting to see higher revenues and hopefully in a few years positive earnings.\n\n\\*As stated on their earnings call, no guidance was given\\*\n\n**Cash on hand**\n\nEvery time the stock spiked, they did an offering. Their most recent offering, on February 16th was for $12.80. And it raised $500 MILLION. As of two weeks ago, they had just about $1.5 BILLION cash on hand. After two acquisitions already (explained below), they have just under $1.4 BILLION\n\n(Yes, that means a bunch of people bought shares at high prices and you can buy it now cheaper then they did)\n\nYes, stock offerings are not good but Yoav Stern (CEO) made it very clear on the investors phone call they hosted last week that they have enough cash on hand to do what they envision, and no more share offerings will happen.\n\nTo put this into perspective, they have $1.4 billion in cash. their market cap as of today is just under 2 billion. Roughly, their current cash values them alone at around $6 a share. This doesn't include patents they own, the newly acquired companies, their technology, and just the valuation itself.\n\n**Acquisitions**\n\nThe company plans to use its money on acquiring companies (No, $NNDM is NOT a SPAC)\n\nSo far, they've acquired two companies in the past two weeks (and these are very tiny acquisitions, bigger ones are expected)\n\nDeepCube (AI Company - their technology will be used in the currently DragonFly Machine) ($70 Million TOTAL - 40 Million Cash / 30 Million Shares)\n\nNanoFabrica (3D Printing - \\*the company had a investment lead by Microsoft) (\\~$59 Million TOTAL - \\~$27 Million Cash / 32 Million Shares) \\*The final numbers are not confirmed\\*\n\nSo they've only burned through roughly $70 million. They still have around $1.4 Billion.\n\nTheir plan is to acquire companies listed as Type A, Type B, and Type C.\n\nType A - Existing companies in PCB business. Companies with revenue between 40-150 million!\n\nType B - Technologies they think their machines need\n\nType C - Companies that have machines that cater to the same customers that Nano Dimension does. Literally buying their competition and expanding their customer base.\n\n**Unusual Option Activity**\n\nSpecifically, for short term options, there is high open interest on 3 strike call prices.\n\nMay 21st Options (\\*As of 4/30/21)\n\n$7.50 - 35,197 Open Interest\n\n$10.00 - 35,875 Open Interest\n\n$12.50 - 22,308 Open Interest\n\nShould also be mentioned the activity on the Puts.\n\n$7.50 PUT - 20,552 Open Interest\n\n**Stock Activity**\n\nI'm not much of a stock chart analyst, and I don't think \"technicals\" matter for a stock like this. If you take a look at the YTD chart, it's pretty ugly. Ever since February, $NNDM and plenty of other \"growth\" stocks have been hit hard. After a high of $17.89, it's fallen as low as the low $6.00 range. \n\n**Upcoming Catalysts** \n\n* Earnings are expected to be around mid-may. Last earnings, despite low numbers (for this stock revenue isn't that important yet) the stock ran up from mid $6 range to over $11 in under 2 weeks.\n* According to the CEO, they have a NEW DragonFly they are expecting to release by summer time.\n* Any further acquisitions (Already had 2 the past 2 weeks)\n\n**Two Good Articles Worth Reading**\n\nA very bullish article was posted to Yahoo Finance last week on Nano Dimension, and it's worth the read.\n\n([https://finance.yahoo.com/news/small-company-pioneering-breakthrough-technology-165540025.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/small-company-pioneering-breakthrough-technology-165540025.html))\n\n*\"This is a $1.8 billion company. The PCB market is marching towards $70-plus billion in value. Nano Dimension is sitting on a breakthrough technology that could disrupt that entire market.*\n\n*Long term, you’re talking a potentially multi-billion-dollar revenue opportunity, the likes of which could easily result in a $10-plus billion valuation…\"*\n\nCathie Wood actually briefly mentioned Nano Dimension during an interview.\n\n([https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cathie-wood-shares-thoughts-nano-122015778.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cathie-wood-shares-thoughts-nano-122015778.html))\n\n*A key quote from her is \"We always look for where the defense is putting their money\"*\n\n**The Negatives**\n\n* The company has a rather high short interest (many websites are giving different numbers, but according to FinViz it is around 38%) \n* The company isn't producing high revenues, and its burning cash\n* COVID is still impacting Europe, and they have a decent customer base out there\n\n**Positions**\n\n620 Shares - $10.85 average.\n\nMay 21st $10 Calls\n\n*Not a financial advisor*", "id": "n2ip93", "created_utc": 1619876954.0, "score": 136, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 71, "comments": [{"body": "I'm in huge here.

Other than that, I'm long on the company.

Cathies got better ones to follow just cause she bought them doesn't mean it's a sure thing. Despite having a 3d printing etf I don't think she's an expert on the topic just bullish on the industry as a whole. I kinda agree with the mindset of betting on the industry leaders if you're long. The electronic 3d printing subsector is tiny right now. Sure there's a lot of potential but if you're gonna be timing the market ride the wave with what's hot. What's hot in 3d printing is metals metals metals right now. Desktop metal just bought Envision tech and they're stock price got hammered lately. That would be a miles better play than NNDM. NNDM really got lucky being a meme stock/short squeeze whatever happened and they did good capitalizing on it. If that didn't happen they woulda been on the struggle bus for a long time. Their only customers rn are universities because the only thing this is good for is research. It's not gonna scale till at least 2030 bet. So if you're going long be prepared to wait and have an exit strategy because if it spikes it's not gonna be a plateau. Like I said sure they can be revolutionary but being too early you miss out on so many other things. I'm not touching NNDM with a 10 foot pool because most people sorely misunderstand 3d printing and don't know the first thing about it or the industry. \n\nFor instance people say GE is a boomer stock but little do they know GE additive is pretty damn good tech which they leverage for the LEAP fuel nozzle. They don't have competition because of that and people are never gonna stop buying their engines especially because of American protectionism. Like I said applications are the value creator in AM. 3d printed electronics don't create any value right now and won't for YEARS. About acquisitions the TAM for microfabrication is pretty small too and still in research phase. Trust me I know. I tried to mass produce micro-orings via 3d printing and it's goddamn difficult and near impossible at this stage. Go ahead and invest in them but don't bet the farm. Good luck.
