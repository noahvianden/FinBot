{"title": "Are you all just selling the same insurance?", "selftext": "So at first glance, options seemed incredibly complex to me. Complex math of course, combined with all sorts of weird jargon, and some famous examples of options trading going catastrophically wrong.\n\nI got into it from reading about the idea of selling naked puts, which seems very simple. People don't want risk, especially the fat-tail risk, so they'll pay a premium to make it go away.  This is completely well-known and robust in all markets. So you make money by collecting that premium, and just manage your own risk so you don't get blown up when things crash.\n\nWhen I read about other options-selling strategies... they all seem like basically the same thing? You're just \"selling insurance\" in one form or another. Maybe you're selling calls, covering people who are afraid of a big upward move for whatever reason. Maybe you're selling spreads, so you're only insuring against smaller moves. Maybe you're insuring against time as well as price. Maybe you're doing it long term, or short term, or on commodities, or on the vix, or whatever. All sorts of complicated strategies.\n\nBut it all seems to end up being the same thing:\n\n(1) collect risk premium\n\n(2) manage your own risk so you don't get blown up\n\n...right? Which makes me think that basically all of these strategies end up being more-or-less the same. You just have to calculate your risk, and bet accordingly with something like the [Kelly Criterion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_criterion). I feel like there's a lot of flim-flam going on where people try to make it seem like they've got some killer strat that only works with very specific timing/prices/markets, but if you do the math properly you'd see it's all the same risk/reward payoff.\n\nIt's most obvious when you look at volatility. You could sell an option on something with high volatility and make a high premium, but that also comes with high risk for you. Or you could sell one with low volatility and low risk. If you sell multiple options on the low volatility one, it ends up exactly the same.\n\nMaybe there are some inefficient options contracts out there which could be found and exploited.

This is why I think this sub tends to focus a bit too much on the greeks - if you’re looking to make 5% returns, any plays that will give you that have pretty much the same chance of working out - otherwise some machine would‘ve found the „better“ offer already and used it until it’s priced correctly. \n\nTo make a provocative statement: If you base your trading mainly on the greeks, you‘re trying to outsmart billion-dollar algorithms. \n\nSo what’s the point? Why not just think of a desired return, buy the first thing that fulfills it and go home? \n\nHumans can’t beat algorithms at their game, but we have access to a different kind of information: fundamentals, sentiment and possibilities. I‘ve just seen another post about MindMed and I think it’s a great example: When options for that ticker come available in a few days, algorithms will know exactly how much they should cost according to average volume, volatility, price movement, order volumes, etc. \n\nWhat they can NOT factor into their calculations is what will determine their long-term success: Do psychedelics really have a positive effect on mental health? Will they succeed in making this effect reliable? Will governments be open to that? Could competitors beat them in development?\n\nIn my opinion, that is what you should trade on. It’s basically where the often heard advice „Only wheel a stock you‘re comfortable holding long term“ comes from. \n\nI feel like that’s the part that’s missing in your post. I‘m not selling CCs on my shares just because I‘m an insurance company, I‘m selling them because I personally think there’s no reason the price should rise above my strikes, and if it does, I‘d be happy to sell at that price because it’s more than I think it should be worth. \n\nI know that some people will at least partly disagree with this.
