You do realize if the stock splits so do the options. It's a non issue.", "score": 23, "replies": [{"body": "Yea dude. Your math works out usually for reverse splits. \n\nProblem is you‚Äôre playing with a volatility option. Volatility options calls are more expensive than puts (just check your option chain) because they are there to mitigate tail risk (the risk of market crashing or aliens). The problem is you‚Äôre paying way OTM options where most of the value is coming from volatility or vega.\n\nWhat happens after the reverse split is that all of a sudden you are not holding as many contracts. When that happens, the volatility of your position goes down (since you‚Äôre profiting 10x less from any market crashes). What happens usually at this point is that UVXY swan dives until it lands at a place right for its volatility. This will suck for you since the value of those options is like 90% made up of vega", "score": 29, "replies": [{"body": "Wallst may come in to play this trade when every1 flee from UVXY.

I just had some VXX calls that reverse split.  The bid/ask seemed a little worse, but I was none worse for it.  Of course, these were on heavily traded options, your results may vary.  You wouldn't have to buy as many options if you buy post-split, so if you're paying fees that is something to consider.  Also, if you're going to use options to leverage anyway, I would probably use VXX because its decay isn't as harsh as UVXY.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "OP owes you a cut - you saved him a couple of Gs", "score": 7, "replies": []}, {"body": "Reverse split doesn't matter for this, they will just be converted to the new price which will continue to steadily drop down like it has since they invented this money shredder", "score": 17, "replies": [{"body": "Lol seriously, like the reverse split matters for this smh", "score": 9, "replies": []}, {"body": "hahahahha good point", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "He thinks that the reverse split will make his options print. because he bought in at 100.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "No, I'm not that retarded.
