Griffin, the Barbarian Behind the Gates of the Citadel", "selftext": "Привет идиоты,\n\nI have returned to inflict more psychic damage upon you about the sick fucks that make up the worldwide disease that is Big Capital. Today, I would like to talk to you about [Kenneth Cordele Griffin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_C._Griffin), the founder and CEO of a little company called [Citadel LLC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citadel_LLC).\n\nNow unless you have been living under a fucking rock for the past week or have drank yourself to the point of amnesia for one reason or another (forgivable), you are probably by now at least vaguely aware of what Citadel does and how it relates to current events surrounding GameStop and WSB's new favorite hedge fund, Melvin Capital. \n\nSeeing as how there's a few million more of you here now than there were last month when I was emptying the contents of the bowl of oatmeal that is my brain on these pages about [present day financial crimes perpetrated by Citadel and their ilk](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kbjpqy/an_alternative_hypothesis_for_psth_stripe_for_the/) and the [ouroboros of Western intelligence agencies and Big Capital](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kcm0r9/once_more_unto_the_breach_the_unified_field/), let's do a quick recap. I do hope you take the time to read the full posts, because you may learn something interesting. ^^^PSTH ^^^= ^^^Stripe ^^^🚀🚀🚀\n\n1.  The markets and the flow of capital around the world are rife with financial crime.\n\n1. The vast majority of this crime is perpetrated by large institutions like Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, and Deutsche Bank. Some of this crime takes the form of laundering money for drug cartels, terrorists, pedophiles, and sex traffickers. Some of it involves manipulation of the markets.\n\n1. The regulators in charge of dealing with these fucks are utterly spineless, to the point that any honest person must wonder out loud if they're in on it and getting a take. This phenomenon is known as [regulatory capture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_capture) and is a particularly insidious form of political corruption.\n\n1. The CIA, since its inception in 1947, has acted as a sort of parallel government within the broader United States government, and has been the primary ideological engine of its foreign policy through its ties to Big Capital. That foreign policy has always kept the interests of business as its top priority. One might even call this the Deep State. \n\n#Who is Ken Griffin?\n\nKen Griffin is the absolute epitome of the archetypal scumfuck egomaniac asshole that embodies everything that is wrong with the ultra-rich class of Big Capital. Ahem, sorry. Let's try that again.\n\nKen Griffin started his career out as a 🌈🐻 at the age of 19 while an undergraduate at Harvard, shorting the convertible bonds market and making a bunch of money off of the [October 19th, 1987 crash, more commonly known as Black Monday.](https://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/June-2011/The-File-on-Citadels-Ken-Griffin/) He graduated in 1989, supposedly returned 70% in his first year as a professional fund manager, and went on to found Citadel in 1990. Citadel has swelled to gargantuan size in the last 30 years. It apparently almost [went under in 2008 during the financial crisis](https://www.wsj.com/articles/citadels-ken-griffin-leaves-2008-tumble-far-behind-1438655887), but they were fine after the empty suit known as Barack Obama reneged on his campaign promises and fully sealed the transfer of the United States to Wall Street and the rest of the 1%. The hedge fund managed $35 billion as of October 2020 (probably less now LOLOLOL) and a [little more than a quarter of all equity volume flows through Citadel Securities in their capacity as a market maker.](https://www.chicagobusiness.com/finance-banking/ken-griffins-citadel-securities-reaps-record-67-billion-volatility)\n\nHe lives in Chicago, but that's not very important. I will note that Chicago has been a historically CIA rat-infested city, as evidenced by the group of [University of Chicago-trained economists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Boys) that helped carry out the regime change ops and aggressive neoliberalization of South America in the 20th century. He's not a complete political partisan, but he does tend to favor Republicans. He has donated to Democratic Party luminaries like [Rod Blagojevich and Rahm Emanuel](https://www.chicagotribune.com/politics/ct-met-ken-griffin-political-donations-20190213-story.html), libertarian psychopaths like the [Koch Brothers, and neocon war hawk freaks like Karl \"Turd Blossom\" Rove.](https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-0310-ken-griffin-interview-story.html) His most recent political contributions were to Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue, the two imbecilic former Senators from Georgia who were both busted for dumping stocks on insider information shortly before the [Great Beer Virus Crash of 2020.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_stock_market_crash) The thread tying these fine folks together is that what most people in the United States think of as politics is more akin to a game show than a real system of governance, and the ultra-rich value their class allegiance much higher than their allegiance to any one political party. As a slight aside, [Loeffler's husband](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Sprecher) is the chairman of the New York Stock Exchange. How in the fuck is the spouse of a (formerly) sitting Senator allowed to hold that position? Yuck.\n\n\n#The Ken Griffin Real Estate Portfolio\n\n(Disclaimer: Griffin may not still own every property in this section and I don't care to find out which, if any, he has divested himself from, because frankly, the levels of opulence make me feel fucking sick.

For the extreme smoothbrains among you, the reason Griffin blows giant bags on horrible pieces of art and puts them on public display is so that he can use them as tax writeoffs.\n\nHerein lies the part where you may call me a conspiracy theorist if you please, but I think Griffin's art portfolio is indicative of some type of covert relationship with the intelligence agencies. I sincerely do not believe that any person can reach these strata of society without at least brushing elbows with some glowies. The most expensive pieces in his collection come from the school of art known as [abstract expressionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_expressionism), which was [quite literally a CIA-sponsored project](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/modern-art-was-cia-weapon-1578808.html) meant to counter the influence of [Soviet realism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_realism) during the Cold War. The idea was that the Soviets would see the wacky vomitus that people like Jackson Pollock would spew all over a canvas as an expression of the ideals of freedom and individuality and break free of the bonds of Communism.\n\n* [False Start](https://www.moma.org/collection/works/67552) by Jasper Johns.

Recall that Epstein is highly suspected of being some type of intelligence asset tasked with blackmailing rich scumbags by anyone who has studied his story closely.\n* [Number 17A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_17A) by Jackson Pollock. More abstract expression trash, also purchased from David Geffen for $200 million.\n\n#How does Citadel spend its money?\n\nGood question! They buy politicians. Remember regulatory capture? Here's Citadel doing just that: current Secretary of the Treasury, former Chair of the Federal Reserve, and sentient potato woman Janet Yellen took more than [$800,000 in speaking fees from Citadel](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2021/01/28/wh_wont_say_if_janet_yellen_should_recuse_herself_after_taking_800k_in_speaking_fees_from_key_figure_in_gamestoprobinhood_scandal_hft_firm_citadel.html#!). In fact, [Yellen \"earned\" over $7 million in speaking fees](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/18/us/politics/janet-yellen-treasury.html) from various other financial institutions including Goldman Sachs and Citigroup between her stints at the Fed and at Treasury. What do we think? Is she just such an enrapturing speaker that she's worth every penny? Or is she getting a kickback for helping to deregulate financial markets and a bribe to look the other way when short sellers and market makers collude to shut retail traders out of the market en masse, like they did yesterday with GME?\n\nThey also buy stakes in distressed hedge funds, apparently. Remember the [$2.75 billion bailout](https://nypost.com/2021/01/25/this-short-seller-just-got-a-2-75-billion-bailout/) that Citadel and Point72 gave to Melvin Capital on Monday, which they promptly pissed away doubling down on their GME short? Isn't it weird that Robinhood shut down trading on the very stocks that the hedge funds were bleeding out from and then forced people to liquidate their long positions at the very bottom of a coordinated short seller attack? Doesn't it seem a little strange that the hedge fund branch of Citadel is allowed to own part of another hedge fund that's being bled dry, as [Citadel Securities buys order flow from Robinhood](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1m2p1cv68bx56/Twitter-Freaked-Out-Over-Robinhood-Selling-Its-Trade-Flow-But-the-App-and-Others-Have-Been-Doing-It-for-Years) to [illegally front-run retail orders?](https://imgur.com/0yT6vpJ)\n\nThere's also this, on the topic of Melvin Capital and pedophiles and sex traffickers: Melvin Capital's 5th largest long holding is a company called L Brands, which is the parent of Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works. Victoria's Secret, as seasoned Jeffrey Epstein gumshoes will know, was founded by one [Leslie Wexner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Wexner), who had a very troubling relationship with Epstein. Epstein was Wexner's personal money manager and Wexner was Epstein's only known client. Wexner and Epstein were so close that [Wexner gave Epstein a mansion on the Upper East Side in Manhattan](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/08/victorias-secret-epstein/595507/) in 2011, years after it was already known that he was a pedophile creep. Epstein would tell the girls he was sexually assaulting that he was a [modeling scout for Victoria's Secret](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/08/victorias-secret-epstein/595507/). [Jean-Luc Brunel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Luc_Brunel), another Epstein-associated \"modeling scout\" and sex criminal who was [recently arrested in France](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/modeling-agent-jean-luc-brunel-charged-rape-minor-jeffrey-epstein-n1251804), would supply models to Victoria's Secret through his agency MC2 Model Management. Basically, what I'm saying is that Melvin Capital, and now Citadel by extension, are long sex trafficking pedophiles.\n\n#How can I poke this asshole in the eye?\n\nIt seems like there's two big things you can do to [do your part.](https://imgur.com/tL98PiA) \n\nThe first is to 💎👐 GME. The institutions are clearly scared shitless at how much blowback is coming their way or they wouldn't be taking such drastic measures to try to tip the scales in the favor of the shorts at the expense of everyone else. Turn off share lending in your brokerage if you can and still haven't.\n\nThe second is to transfer your assets out of Robinhood yesterday and graduate to a big boy brokerage. Citadel Securities (remember, this is the market maker, not the hedge fund) [banked a record $6.7 billion in profit last year](https://www.chicagobusiness.com/finance-banking/ken-griffins-citadel-securities-reaps-record-67-billion-volatility). You can bet that this has at least a little to do with the influx of Robinhooders pressing the market order button on their phones and letting Citadel front run their orders while Robinhood gives them a garbage fill.\n\n##TLDR: Ken Griffin final boss.
