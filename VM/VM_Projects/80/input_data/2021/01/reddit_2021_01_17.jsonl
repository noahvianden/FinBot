Developers and manufacturers have multiple, and probably better ways of collecting data already and I don't think whatever sort of data GS can gather will be worth much\n      * **OP's reply:** Yes, I agree with you that developers and manufacturers have their own way of collecting data. However, GameStop will be able to provide data on the market overview of the gaming industry if they manage to pull of being a centralized e-commerce giant\n   * Turning physical stores into a showcase vendor’s games or new concepts\n      * That's what youtube is for...\n      * **OP's reply:** I believe there's a market for people who prefer physical roadshows or showcases compared to online videos.\n   * Possibility to create a neutral platform for trading digital goods and charge a small fee for facilitating transactions\n      * Like Steam's marketplace? Aren't most tradeable items on Steam from Valve games? This idea would require games from unrelated devs to have tradeable digital goods and that they would sign it over to GameStop's trading platform, but why would they do that? What would they gain out of it? Or are you talking about digital goods like digital copies of games? No gaming company would allow trading/reselling of digital copies of games. This idea is a non-starter.\n      * **OP's reply:** I do agree this idea seem far-fetched, but there is a possibility that it can be pulled off.\n   * E-sports tournaments/leagues to be held at physical stores\n      * This idea of turning physical stores into social hangouts like the Warhammer DnD game stores is a little sketchy. Because 1) it requires investment into physical space and 2) it essentially turns the store into a PC bang which only really works in Asia due to costs and culture. Furthermore, why would I go out of my way to play games with a bunch of sweaty nerds at a GS store when I could just do it at home without smelling their BO?\n      * **OP's reply:** They may convert several stores into PC shops for the purpose of E-sports leagues/tournaments only but not operate a PC shop business. There's definitely money to be made in the growing e-sports scene. E.g. advertising, streaming, etc.\n   * RYAN COHEN: e-commerce\n      * How does his expertise in pet food ecommerce translate into brick and mortar gaming stores?\n      * **OP's reply:** We are speculating that the management are going to announce their plans between Apr-Jun 2021.\n   * Low price to sales ratio at 0.4476 as at 15/1/21\n      * Well, yes, because there's no clear path to long term revenue\n\n**Bear case conclusion**: Business turnaround fails and trend towards book value at a price target of $5.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Bull Thesis**\n\n* Nintendo next game console in 2022\n   * 4th year into Nintendo switch’s 7-year life cycle, estimated new console launch in 2022\n   * Continue to be a distributor for game consoles and benefit from Nintendo’s new console launch\n* Estimated total addressable market for gaming of USD151Bn and growing\n   * Established relationship with 42 million gamers through PowerUp Rewards loyalty program\n   * 15.2 million members have purchased or traded at GameStop in 2019\n   * Data is a key asset as the company can use it to analyse new trends in gaming\n   * Data can be monetized by selling it to gaming manufacturers or developers\n* Vendor partnerships\n   * Turning physical stores into a showcase vendor’s games or new concepts\n   * Opportunity to monetize publisher and console manufacturer relationships\n   * Possibility to create a neutral platform for trading digital goods and charge a small fee for facilitating transactions\n   * E-sports tournaments/leagues to be held at physical stores\n* Brand recognition of GameStop and a lack of centralization for gaming\n   * Opportunity for GameStop to be a centralized e-commerce platform for gaming consoles, digital games, merchandise, customization of computers, laptops, gaming chairs, etc.\n* Low price to sales ratio at **0.4476** as at 15/1/21\n* Board refreshment - Ryan Cohen, Alan Attal and Jim Grube previously from successful Chewy Inc.

I don't see any \"bear case\" counterarguments.\n\nOkay, I'll be the bear and shit all over this because it's flat out wrong.\n\n>Nintendo next game console in 2022\n\nPriced in. Doesn't matter. Same with the other revenue bump. I mean if quarterly revenue reports did not exist the actual boost in revenues just wouldn't hold water; it's a known thing so it's not really even in the thesis. That's like saying, \"Winter is the busy time for snow plowing\". It's just not smart.\n\n>Data can be monetized by selling it to gaming manufacturers or developers\n\nThis aftermarket data is useless. No one cares if you traded in Dark Souls for Nioh. \"New Trends\" my ass. That is something someone jsut flat out made up without thinking about it for twenty seconds. That's again like saying, \"People tend to buy snowblowers and shovels near the winter and summer\". Yeah? And when did you learn that, when they were being sold, not a year later at a swapshop.\n\n>Turning physical stores into a showcase vendor’s games or new concepts\n\nThey already do this. It's not a bullet point if it's already done. Have you not seen the little TVs in the corners of every store advertising shit? Are you blind? Have you never gone into one of these? And yeah, this is ten years old. It's not a new point. Let's use this as one word: \"Advertising\". Yeah, they've done that.\n\n>Possibility to create a neutral platform for trading digital goods and charge a small fee for facilitating transactions\n\nI swear there was something (**STEAM COUGH HUMBLEBUNDLE COUGH GOG COUGH IN-GAME PURCHASES LIKE IN MINECRAFT**) that already did this. And has been for a while. Huh. I must not be up on the trends. Sounds groundbreaking if they pull it off!\n\n>E-sports tournaments/leagues to be held at physical stores\n\nJesus if this is on there you live under a fucking rock. For one most of the stores don't have the space, two they already got into the e-sports thing years ago (and it flopped, twice, read the investor letters) and three again, there *might* be competition that **already does this and has for ten years** so... I don't know. Again, \"revolutionary thinking\".\n\n>Opportunity for GameStop to be a centralized e-commerce platform for gaming consoles, digital games, merchandise, customization of computers, laptops, gaming chairs, etc.\n\nNow this is stupid. \"Opportunity for Gamestop to be a centralized ...\" makes no fucking sense. Let's spill this in plain English: GAMESTOP MISSED THE BOAT AND STEAM IS THE CENTRALIZED ECOMMERCE PLATFORM. We good? Good. There is no \"opportunity\" for this to occur as if there were a vacuum. This would have to be a hostile takeover of ridiculous proportions. Why people type so many words to say, \"GAMESTOP FIGHT STEAM\" I don't know.\n\n>\\[Cohen etc\\]  Proven successful e-commerce track record\n\nCohen has had one company. One. That's it. It's not a \"track record\". It's a fucking singular company. Quit doing this. They ran a company that was in Cohen's control (so no, not even all together from the beginning) for 5 years. 5. STOP WITH THE LEGENDS. I mean this is not a Venture Capitalist investor who has made 30 bets on companies and brought back 10 from the brink. He made 1. It went well. That's it.\n\n>Estimated short interest of 138% not covered\n\nHow the fuck does the shortsqueeze even matter? Get the fuck out of here with your \"analyses\".\n\nLook, no more, stop guys. Stop. For one the \"bear case\" is just wrong and be TL;DR'd as such:\n\n# GAMESTOP IS SO LATE TO THE GAME THAT IT PROBABLY WON'T BE ABLE TO PENETRATE THE MARKET SHARE OF THE FUTURE MARKETPLACE FOR GAMES IN ANY MEANINGFUL WAY WITHOUT NEW TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION.\n\nThat's the bear case.

I've really enjoyed watching WSB stick it to the shorts, and keep a dying business alive  (a dying business that has high nostalgia factor for me...I spent much of my childhood loitering in Gamestop stores).\n\nThat being said, GME really needs to reimagine itself to keep from becoming the next Blockbuster Video. I'll give you the view from the development side:\n\n**Cons:**\n\n\\- Digital works way better for game-makers. We don't have to waste money on Cost of Goods. Customers don't have to worry about losing disks/scratched disks. We don't lose money to the re-sale gray market.\n\n\\- Consoles are becoming a smaller part of our strategy every year. PC and mobile are rapidly growing markets that are way outpacing console. Streaming games through a platform-agnostic thin client also looks like it could be the real future of games. Even the console makers themselves are starting to realize that platform-exclusives won't work long-term (except for Nintendo...they play by their own rules and are really just a platform for their own games).\n\n\\- Microsoft's push to make XBox the \"Netflix of Games\" also doesn't bode well for the business. Sony is also looking for their own unique spin on content to compete with Microsoft.\n\n\\- Live service games are also becoming the dominant type of game. This again pushes the industry further from GME's model.\n\n**Pros:**\n\n\\- The console makers do value a physical space where players can come to talk about games, buy game-related materials, and learn more about games. This why they've started to cut GME in on digital sales, and open up avenues for GME to sell games digitally.\n\n\\- Ryan Cohen. If RC wasn't involved, I'd be screaming to look for another stock to back. RC is the real deal and has the radical out-of-the-box thinking needed to really turn the business around. If anyone can think of a way to lead GME to greatness again, he's the guy.\n\n**My Take:**\n\nYou have the shorts on the ropes. Go for the squeeze. But remember that squeezes are short-lived by definition. Have a plan to identify the top and collect your profits. After that I'd pursue other stocks until RC unveils a plan that looks like something you'd want to go long on.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Holy shit.
