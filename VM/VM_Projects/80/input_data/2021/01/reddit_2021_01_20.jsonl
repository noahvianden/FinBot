{"title": "DD on $FIZZ, possibly next big 🚀 short squeeze", "selftext": "Short story for those with ADD:\n-Second highest “short to float” ratio to GME\n-Higher ratio of shorts to volume than GME\n-Low float, moves on air\n-well known brand (LaCroix) that is printing money via high/steady profits and is in the process of paying our $250M in special cash dividend\n\nIf you missed GME, BB, etc, this may be the next big one\n\n\n\n\n\nFull DD for those who care:\n\nPosted yesterday about $FIZZ, which has all the ingredients for a short squeeze for the ages. I did some more DD, and am aggregating it here. $FIZZ is the LaCroix sparkling water company, with plenty of other lesser known brands\n\n-short interest of 7.3M shares on a float of 8.8M shares (83%, which is the second highest to $GME among all stocks, as far as I can tell)\n\n-given average volume around 300,000/day, it would take shorts 27 trading days to cover (this is the highest I’ve found, about 5 times what it was for GME before the squeeze\n[fizz short interest](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/fizz/short-interest)\n\n-1 person (founder and CEO) owns over 33M shares, and he’s an old Italian guy who hates short sellers (so he’ll never sell, which is the definition of💎🙌)\n\n-late last year they announced a $6/share dividend which is payable in February (remember, shorts have to pay the dividend for any borrowed share because the company only pays the didvidend once per share, while a short share is borrowed and sold, meaning 2 people “own” the same 1 share.)\n\n-recent uptrend in price and volume coincides with the epic $GME squeeze, likely indicating an attempt  by shorts to begin covering. But the total volume of <1.8M the last 3 days wouldn’t even put a dent in the short interest, and we all know that only a fraction of that was shorts covering.\n\n-Company still has over $100M in cash and is hugely profitable\n     •33% ROE\n     •20% operating margin\n     •>$200M operating cash flow\n     •44% earnings growth\n[fizz financials](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FIZZ/key-statistics?p=FIZZ)\n     •CEO will get $200M CASH from the dividend. I could see him buying another million shares to lock away, further reducing the float and making short covering even harder \n\nSo a profitable, growing business with an old Italian CEO who is angry at short sellers, paying huge dividends, and a potentially even further reduced float. Think about shorts trying to buy back 7M shares from 💎🙌 WSB traders when the days to cover ratio is 27.  Even $GME was “only” about 5-6 (which is a very big number!)\n\nAs an added bonus, some chart guys can add to this, but the 3 month MACD Golden cross happened Friday, it is now above 20 and 50 day averages, and probably some other stuff I don’t understand.  😂\n\nI think $GME was the king due to the short interest being higher than the float, but this isn’t far behind, especially given its ability to move large amounts on low volume. The stock is up about 20% the last 3 days on almost no “extra” volume, and given the volume increase the shorts would need to create to cover shares while fighting retail and institutions who see this coming too, this could definitely double, triple, quadruple, who knows. That’s a lot of shares the shorts need to pry from people. And being honest, current holders of stocks like this may not even be the kinds of people that check their portfolio religiously, so you may even see market makers having to sell shares they don’t have to keep an orderly market since there’s not enough liquidity to cover that many short shares, which just adds fuel to the fire. Plus, the dividend and threat of another special dividend has to scare the crap out of them as a double whammy of buying back at a big loss and then paying out CASH to the people you sold to.\n\nI definitely look forward to the smell of burning shorts on this one. \n\nGood luck if you join me!", "id": "l1aod7", "created_utc": 1611154370.0, "score": 93, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 81, "comments": [{"body": "Instructions unclear; bought more GME 🙌🏻💎🥜🚀", "score": 75, "replies": [{"body": "I don’t hate that response.
