{"title": "200K to invest - LEAPs and Weekly Covered Calls?", "selftext": "Happy New Years.  I turned my 100K into 87K returns this year, mostly swing trading, spreads, and some long-term LEAPs (covered calls) that I eventually sold.  TSLA, SE, and CRWD probably were my best returns.  I also made a lot of mistakes or left money on table as first year.  I felt I did well managing/leveraging covered calls, got better at it because I typically buy .65 and .75 Delta and sale between .10 and .15 Delta (depending on bullish or my underline Delta position).  I do have a long-term LEAP in AMZN 2023 that I'll eventually sale soon in 2021, just because of the size.  I opened my RH and TOS accounts in May.  This is my first year as a trader mostly just invested into 401K, Vanguard, etc.  I would say I am not very good at day trading (shaky, weak hands but understanding charts better) and want to avoid that temptation as much as possible.  I also have not traded NKLA, PLTR, NIO, or any other high IV stock.\n\nGoing into new year 2021, I may change my philosophy slightly in terms of transitioning to 75-90% LEAPS and covered calls, so I built a worksheet with potentially returns.  I feel going to LEAPS allows less managing of trades since I work and it's just more time-consuming, although I like to research and read a lot of twitter feeds and charts after hours.\n\nLEAP Spreadsheet:[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ujf2u\\_hrcx6ZPehhg558\\_GfxUQhpN3cXGqBQnjII6OU/edit#gid=291469](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ujf2u_hrcx6ZPehhg558_GfxUQhpN3cXGqBQnjII6OU/edit#gid=291469)\n\nAttached is QQQ at 25% IV with annual 12% annual return and SE at 56% IV at 25% (as an example stock) annual return with a scheduled 3 year LEAP to Dec 2023, stocks at moment only go to JAN 2023 but in comparison wanted to look at QQQ/SE at 3 years.   Leveraging LEAPS allows my so-called stock buying power to be around 500K to 1mil in positions depending on IV.\n\nThis is a worksheet that's basic enough, inputs are annual return rate and sale of covered calls ratio of return.  I understand IV can change down the road for a particular stock however QQQ seems to always run about 25% historically.\n\nI do have a decent paying job, so I can take a somewhat of hit on downside or risk.  My 2021 and continue yearly goal is to take part of my monthly salary and probably buy 1 LEAP every quarter.  Also reinvest premium $$$ and turn those into swings or buy new LEAPs as well.\n\n1. Is it best to invest ALL into QQQ or mix it up a bit?  If so what LEAPs would you consider or sectors?\n2. Or is it best to continue do what I am doing, which is mostly swing trading with weekly/monthly spreads/diagonals.\n3. Weekly covered calls are worth more however a bit more time-consuming.  Would consider changing some to both weekly/monthly or even bi-weeklies.\n4. If my underline is at 65% delta, typically generate a 8%-10% sale of weekly Delta.  If higher that 70% generally 10% to 12% depending on bullish or not.  I learned the hard-way not to be at 30% delta for gains plus of weekly Gamma.  Also understanding IV and how that plays into weekly CC.\n5. The biggest risk of course is having 3 years of negative returns (think 2000-2003) on LEAPs especially buying 200K worth.  However using the spreadsheet, allows me to eek out small gains with covered weeklies.\n6. If plan to go towards more LEAPs what percentage would that be on 200K, maybe 75% or 150K in LEAPS or slightly more?\n7. Is it best to buy something at 75% Delta or 65% which in turn might allow a few more contracts?\n8. Any flaws in my worksheet and calculations?\n9. Biggest situation is TAXES:  Long-term LEAPS should be at Capital Gains 15% while short-term gains will be taxed at my bracket of 24% and 32%.  I am thinking the Long-Term LEAP will be taxed at 15% while the weekly premiums on the LEAP is short term gains.\n\nThanks in advance.Paul", "id": "ko4bcn", "created_utc": 1609472395.0, "score": 119, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 83, "comments": [{"body": "No comment but upvote for signing your Reddit post.", "score": 54, "replies": [{"body": "I’m with this guy.

At $200k annual income in anywhere other than NY/LA/SF, man, you're crushing it. Keep minimizing debt and saving hard. At 48, if you're planning to stay in your current locale, sacrificing some short-term gains and eliminating your mortgage by directing capital at the principal may be a better use of funds...not from a math perspective, but from a SWAN (sleep well at night) perspective.\n\nMy advice is to *sell* options, and not buy them. As Theta Gang will teach you, time decay is the biggest enemy of an options buyer. In order to make money, WSB needs to be correct about the directionality, magnitude, and timing of a price change. Miss one of the three, and you likely have a significant loss. (This is also true of long shareholders, but at least equity is resistant to time decay.)\n\nThere are short option strategies that make us money simply by being correct on any combination of two of these three.\n\nI still recommend more due diligence about the differences between a current income strategy and a total return strategy. Selling options to collect on diminishing theta (time decay) is not; I repeat: **NOT**, a total return strategy.\n\nBased on your situation, I recommend a portfolio approach that is no more aggressive than this:\n\n - Open a cash brokerage account at a \"real\" broker: E-trade (my personal choice), TDAmeritrade, Schwab, or as a last resort: Fidelity. \n - Sell cash-secured puts on equities at a strike price that you would be OK with if the trade was exercised today, regardless of premium. As an example: let's say I want to write a put against Verizon (VZ), one of the lowest IV stocks around (which has the lowest options premium). On fundamentals, VZ is at trading at a 14 P/E with a growing dividend of 4.3%. It's trading at $58 today, but I would be OK with owning VZ at a price of $55 at any time in the next two months. I can sell a put at $55 (55P) today and get $60 in exchange for the promise to buy 100 shares at $55 anytime between now and Feb 19, 2021. \n- Stay disciplined: Don't sell puts on *anything* you wouldn't buy right the hell now.\n- More information about selling puts, and the various risk/reward profiles are available through Tastytrade's series of videos. In general, puts with 30 delta and 35-45 Days Till Expiry have the best historical return on invested capital. \n\nWelcome to Theta Gang, and good luck.\n\nSigned,    \nMe\n\nPS: Happy New Year!", "score": 39, "replies": [{"body": "Sound advice.

That afternoon, SPY inclusion announcement and TSLA exploded for several weeks.  The first few days, I tried to manage sale weekly positions but the volatility and stock increase of really of those OTM calls were reaching 40/50 delta so I moved to a 600Call same 2/21 expiry then 1 week later changed to 650Call same 2/21 expiry to collect premium for my initial investment.
