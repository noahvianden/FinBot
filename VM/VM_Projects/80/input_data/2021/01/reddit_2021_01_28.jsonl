Fucking mods. Posted to promote discussion.\n\nDon't decide what you do based on what I think but here is the bear case for the catalyst for the GME sell-off:\n\nThe events of last Friday's gamma squeeze triggered the stocks run-up and possible short squeeze action we saw this week.\n\nMy thoughts are based on the market events of Wednesday 1/27.\n\nFrom Melvin Capital's most recent quarterly holdings filing (which can be read publicly here: https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1628110/000090571820001111/xslForm13F_X01/infotable.xml) we can almost say with certainty that they liquidated most, if not all of their long positions to cover losses with their short positions. I don't think they reloaded shorts yesterday - I think they are waiting to reload.\n\nAll their assumed short positions have run up over the last month, either due to Melvin covering or due to buys from traders making the same play that has been made on GME or a combination of both.\n\nI think one of these scenarios could play out next week,BE CAREFUL:\n\nOfficial short interest reports release for the end of the month are due for publication from NASDAQ on 2/9 (I am assuming the current reports are not accurate as they are not official). The short interest reports include up to 1/29 and are due for processing on 2/2. IF and ONLY IF they show a LOW short interest, this will trigger a major sell-off in the GME as without the high short interest there is NO MORE upside. I don't think Melvin Capital has given up in this yet, they are not done. Prior to that official data release, I believe they will reload shorts and then cover after the sell-off upon official data release, which is their next attempt to fuck the little guy.\nIf official short interest is still high, this could be another buy catalyst, but I don't think it will be. Melvin liquidating all its capital shows that they HAD to of covered. There has been so much buying and selling that it would have been less detectable to cover systemically throughout the week.\n\nIt depends on how you play this, if you hold you'll still be OK as the price won't drop. Everything points to next week being pretty tame and the 2nd week of February leading to a potential bloodbath.
