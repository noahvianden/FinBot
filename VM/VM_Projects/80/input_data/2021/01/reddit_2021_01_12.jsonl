Why? Because it's going to the fucking moon with this administration. Here's why.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA democratic President, Senate, and Congress are all taking office soon. The Biden administration had already publicized their plans for climate change and Clean Energy back before the election, saying \"[Biden will make a $2 trillion accelerated investment, with a plan to deploy those resources over his first term, setting us on an irreversible course to meet the ambitious climate progress that science demands.](https://joebiden.com/clean-energy/)\" Our man Biden is literally pumping money into climate action, which will include a variety of benefits for the entire Clean Energy industry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, even more interesting, is that in the same article, the administration also says they plan to \"move ambitiously to generate clean, American-made electricity to achieve a carbon pollution-free power sector by 2035. This will enable us to meet the existential threat of climate change while creating millions of jobs with a choice to join a union.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet's look at the numbers from [eia.gov](https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=427&t=3) based on the most recent (2019) statistics:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Energy Source|Billion kWh|Share of Total %|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Total - All Sources|4127|100.0%|\n|Fossil Fuels (total)|2582|**62.6%**|\n|Natural Gas|1586|^(38.4%)|\n|Coal|965|^(23.4%)|\n|Petroleum|18|^(0.4%)|\n|Other Gases|13|^(0.3%)|\n|Nuclear|809|^(19.6%)|\n|Renewables (total)|728|**17.6%**|\n|Wind|295|^(7.1%)|\n|Hydropower|288|^(7.0%)|\n|Solar|72|^(1.7%)|\n|Biomass (total)|58|**1.4%**|\n|Wood|39|^(0.9%)|\n|Landfill gas|10|^(0.3%)|\n|Municipal solid waste|6|^(0.1%)|\n|Other biomass|2|^(0.1%)|\n|Geothermal|15|^(0.4%)|\n|Pumped storage Hydropower|\\-5|^(-0.1%)|\n|Other Sources|13|^(0.3%)|\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLooking at the numbers from 2019 relative to the 15 year target for the US energy sector, the entire Renewables sector will need to grow at an average rate of \\~5% annually for the next 15 years in order to meet that target.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDoes that mean your stonks are only growing 5% annually? No, because 5% never got anyone to the moon. [5% of the US Energy Sector is equivalent to $17.5 Billion annually](https://www.selectusa.gov/energy-industry-united-states#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20International%20Energy,%2Dlargest%20in%20the%20world). That doesn't include the massive amounts of jobs that will be produced as the Clean Energy market rapidly develops. That also doesn't include the additional trillions of dollars that the coming administration intends to continue pumping out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe next big thing to look forward to is Biden's Inaugural Address, where I expect significant mentions of his plan to handle climate change and boost clean energy. Following that of course will be all of the big moves to pass this initial $2 trillion bill.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAre you thinking that ICLN doesn't have enough exposure to the EV market to ride along with TSLA and NIO?\n\nTake a look at [First Trust Clean Edge Green Energy Index (QCLN)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/QCLN?p=QCLN&.tsrc=fin-srch).

{"title": "‚ÄúTSLA bubble is going to pop‚Äù", "selftext": "~ Giga Berlin comes online in middle/fall of this year. Model Y will take 24 months to fully ramp and dominate EV sales by taking the single largest share. This is because the car would be superior in every way including manufacturing (single cast pieces for both front & back), paint (Elon has stated it will be world‚Äôs most advance paint shop), range (due to better cells in the structural pack design - something Elon said would render everybody else uncompetitive long-term if they don‚Äôt copy Tesla‚Äôs design philosophy exactly), expanded Supercharging Network and in-car software. \nGiga Berlin will be producing cells (world‚Äôs most advance) and long-term be world‚Äôs biggest cell production plant (250 GW capacity as stated by Elon).  \nThe next car that would be produced (2022 year end) is a smaller sized vehicle for the biggest segment in Europe. This will keep ramping up until 2025. \n\n~ Giga Shanghai is going to contribute significantly towards 800k+ yearly guidance. Model Y will be the best selling car in its segment as Model 3 was in 2020. Tesla is building a factory in China to produce 10,000 Superchargers annually to for massive expansion. Companies like VW in China are done. They‚Äôre on their way out. Now only Tesla and Chinese automakers would compete. FSD sales are low in China but it will change this year when neural networks will be trained for Chinese roads. The only reason Tesla didn‚Äôt heavily focus on China was because they were busy with Autopilot re-write.\nModel 2 (tentative name given by fans), their upcoming smaller sized vehicle will be designed this year locally in China. They‚Äôre looking for Chief Designer right now. This vehicle will be produced next year. So Tesla will dominate the largest EV segment there as well. \n\n~ Latest FSD Beta already shows that Elon managed to somehow make the ‚Äúquantum shift‚Äù he boasted. Level 5 autonomy will be solved this year. Then it‚Äôs a matter of increasing reliability, handling corner cases and convincing regulators. It‚Äôs a game set match for Tesla. These sons of b‚Äôs did it. Eureka. Tesla will be hosting AI Day this year when Elon will be officially announcing world‚Äôs most powerful Supercomputer (exaFLOP level as he stated for video training). This will be offered as AWS like service as Elon stated. \n\n~ Giga Austin will be completed by year end or early next year. There‚Äôs a lot of mystery around how this plant will operate so let‚Äôs just talk fundamentals. I‚Äôm sure since Elon talked about it last time, plans have changed. Cybertruck has 800k+ pre orders. They have enough pre-orders for until 2024. Forget about new orders. ‚ÄúBut 100 dollars don‚Äôt mean anything‚Äù - Look into your heart, you want it. Everybody wants it. It‚Äôs the final nail in the coffins of Ford and GM. Semi Truck will definitely disrupt trucking. On paper it already beats everything else. Austin will also be producing Tesla‚Äôs 4680 cells. \n\n~ Even if stock goes down, funds will see it as opportunity and bring it right back up. No point arguing over P/E.
