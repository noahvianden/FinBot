GenZ/young investors that may only know of the stock market as of 2020. From the article I posted at the beginning on these tiktok investors:\n\n> “You’ve only been investing since April and have only seen a bull market since then,” they added. “Because you’re talking about money, you have hundreds of thousands following you because everyone wants to make money. You get this power very quickly... Nobody is going to call them out on their bulls***.”\n> \n> Take, for example, @kriskrohn. Kris Krohn is a Gary Vee-style motivational speaker who offers mentorships on real estate investing.\n> \n> On TikTok, he recommends that followers forgo investing via a 401(k), calling the accounts, “fake funny money,” that you “can’t use” and “can’t invest.” Instead, he advocates that his 250,000 followers invest in real estate.\n> \n> Here’s the rub: Krohn was the subject of a 2012 Securities and Exchange Commission complaint for fraudulently offering and selling real estate investments. The court ruled in the SEC’s favor, and Krohn had to pay a $75,000 fine. He did not return a phone call and email seeking comment.\n\nIf these financial moguls were so filthy rich from their investments, why are they *selling* a class for a fee? They could easily make exponentially more by simply using their secret strategies and investing more rather than spend their time getting $20 from a teenager on tiktok...unless that's how they actually make money??\n\nThey are snake oil salesmen repackaged to target younger generations.

During this time, GME bulls have been blessed with a sleuth of positive news. Before we start cookin let me get all the ingredients into the pot for you guys:\n\n# Tendie Recipe\n\n[Provided to you by GME shorts](https://preview.redd.it/sg8apugjsm961.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=17bb70cb3f0a0c5c4bf91e8505e7655177ef15c5)\n\n# Ingredients\n\n1 **DIGITAL** revenue sharing agreement with GameStop  [(certified fresh by Domo Capital Management)](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/10/microsoft-will-give-gamestop-a-share-of-xboxs-digital-revenues/)\n\nXbox Game Pass subscriptions to taste [(15 million subs at $9.99 / month as of Sep 2020)](https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21449219/xbox-game-pass-15-million-subscribers-microsoft-growth).\n\n1 acquisition of one of largest private game developers in the world for $7.5 billion dollars  [(responsible for elder scrolls, fallout, doom...)](https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2020/09/21/welcoming-bethesda-to-the-xbox-family/)\n\n# Cooking Instructions\n\nYou have to have a chef's vision to see all this come together - the goal is to stew enough Game Pass subscriptions to make more and more tendies later on. How do we stew more Game pass subs?\n\n* Bullets below - More Game Pass subs = 🚀🚀🚀\n   * Take the acquisition above and put some of their best games on Game Pass letting anyone on the subscription play it on Console or on PC.  Steam is on PC, and developers are starting to protest them.  Sony doesn't have a gaming subscription for cross PC-Console play. The digital future will have one master race there will be no console or PC - only game.\n   * Partner with the only worldwide gaming focused retailer so they can push your products over competitors.  Sony has a bigger market share globally right now, but with GameStop, Microsoft sees its partner in crime.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ 🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀 ](https://preview.redd.it/jxf6csxg1n961.jpg?width=506&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=49e265425dd12fb93f6b55c0b39ea59b6cf7992f)\n\nAbove you see how much money Microsoft can make ANNUALLY if they get more subscriptions.  Now back to the whole point of this, we need the last ingredient, that spicy Microsoft deal with GameStop.\n\nGameStop get's a cut of Microsoft's digital Xbox revenue. Here is a quote from the article I linked above:\n\n*\"Loop Capital analyst Anthony Chukumba confirmed that same basic outline to Ars Technica based on his conversations with GameStop management. \"The way it's going to work is for every Microsoft Xbox console that GameStop sells going forward, GameStop will get some percentage of the revenue from every digital full game download, DLC, microtransaction, and any subscriptions as well.\"*\n\nHow much of a cut? No one really knows. After July I'll pay one of you paper hands to find out because you're most likely better at that then making this tendie recipe.  Let's speculate though assuming GameStop collects 3% of the revenues.\n\n50 million annual subscriptions = Additional $6 billion in ANNUAL revs for Microsoft\n\nLet's say that GameStop, because they're chummy with Microsoft, sell about 35% of ongoing XBOXs moving forward, allowing them to access the digital revenue share.\n\nThis works out to be additional $63 million dollars at almost 100% margins. And this is just from **subscriptions alone**.  How much are the rest of the DLC, microtransactions, and full digital game downloads worth for GameStop?  It's hard to know because Microsoft doesn't release detailed stats.
