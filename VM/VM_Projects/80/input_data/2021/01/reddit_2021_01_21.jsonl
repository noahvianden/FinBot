You’ve mentioned a few purely chart aspects so you seem a little aligned with this view.\n\nAlso I would much more recommend learning to read a balance sheet. This is typically honest and audited information and when you look at a series of quarters or full years you get a good underlying sense of many things. Obviously revenue, but are they operating more efficiently to retain profit, depending on the company are they investing in R&D? Is payroll expanding or contracting. Are the accumulating or losing cash? Is that cash just coming from debt? Are they issuing more shares which diluted the stock value to get cash? I looked at GEVO a tiny biofuel company and you’ll see they recently have no income, payroll is down, available product inventory is high, and they have no intermediate product- so they’ve shut down, and they said so, no surprise, but operating costs whether producing or not are clearly $5-6M each quarter so now I have a sense of how long they can go before they’re broke. You may also take these deciphered aspects from the balance sheet and compare to similar companies to see more of how the one in question is and has been doing. I much prefer the information here vs chart technical analysis.\n\nAnother simpler and bigger simple reality is that retail investors are a much higher presence, I think I read 30% of volume opposed to 10% a couple years ago. This may be responsible for a huge run up in both “famous” companies like popular tech stocks, but also little previously overlooked stocks like GEVO. People are looking to invest for big returns against big odds. If enough people do this then by golly the stock price shoots up and it begins to actually friggin work. When I looked at GEVO last week they had 10 quarters of cash b4 bust. They flew up multiples in stock price lately, likely because Biden’s tech secretary was cofounder decades ago and green is big. This is naive investing BUT, you know what GEVO did?! They issued more shares at this extremely higher price and now have $350M in the bank, plenty of runway and enough to fund new facility expansion. It actually friggin worked.\n\nSo individual investor people are more simple and naive on average, so the money follows publicized events and news themes more than it has.

Like I said, don't buy individual stocks. Instead broad market ETFs which cover many stocks at once. You can still get caught by overpaying, but at least you're more diversified in your investments. Additionally, these vehicles tend to promote disciplined investing....steady streams of money over the course of time. This doesn't guarantee returns, but it does seem to produce them more than trying to get that big payday by \"buying low and selling high\" within a shorter timeframe. \n\nDo this for a while (this is how I started investing and was more than sufficient for 5-10years) and you'll learn the answers to a lot of those questions you just asked...and more.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": ">You're worried about timing which tells me you haven't taken a long term approach to this problem\n\nThat's because I know that a stock price can swing up and down on a daily basis.

I find them difficult to evaluate since it's not as easy to speculate as it would be with a single company and I am not really comfortable with putting in money and not knowing where it goes. \n\nDo you know of any reliable ones to go with or any resource I could educate myself with?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "\"I'm still poor enough that that's a big deal\"...to which I'd say then your money is probably much better spent somewhere else. Seriously, do you have all bills paid with no debt (housing / student loan may be permitted depending on your circumstances)? Do you have enough cash (ie in a savings account, high yield online preferably) to take you through at least six months of your expenditures? If you had to pay $5000 for something right now could you do it?\n\nIf the answer is \"no\" to any of those questions I'd really recommend working on building those aspects of your financial life up soonest. What you're trying to do with investing isn't bad, but it is like trying to run a marathon when you can't even walk. Being worried about losing $100 means you're going to make bad investment decisions, which means your take losses, which means you're in a worse spot than you are in now. Too many people think investing is like a \"smart man's lottery\"....\"you just have to know a little bit and make the right decision and you'll be rich!\". Personally, I've found it to be more like a street fight... something no one should ever want to do, but sometimes you find yourself having to do where sometimes you win, or lose, for no reason attributable to you whatsoever.\n\nIn any case...to answer what an ETF is I'll explain what a mutual fund is and go from there. A mutual fund takes money from a bunch of people and instead of buying a single stock (like what you want to do) and instead buys a bunch of different stocks. The belief is while your returns may not be as high as if you picked that \"one perfect stock\" you've increased the chance of getting a decent stock and thus making money. The problem with mutual funds is they have a manager which charges fee to pick the stocks that are in the mutual fund. Historically, mutual funds don't produce as much return as the stock market as a whole and cost a significant bit.\n\nThus the ETF was formed. Some smart folks figured out if you take a bunch of money, and buy a basket of stocks that is representative of the market you're trying to track (instead of a bunch of stocks a manger thinks will do well), you can gain the benefits of diversification and the averaged returns of the market being tracked. What's more, because an ETF doesn't have a manager (per se) the costs are kept low and people making bad decisions (selling when they should hold for example) are kept to a minimum. In general, if the market being tracked goes up, you make money. If it goes down you lose money, BUT not as much as you may think since dividends are reinvested and the ETF doesn't try to time the market. VTI is an ETF I got into a long time ago (may still own) from Vanguard...an investment company that built an entire industry out of the ETF concept.\n\nPersonally, as a new investor I would only ever invest in ETFs for the first couple years (or ever really).

{"title": "GME - How shorts manipulated you, and how you can be better", "selftext": "Hello again folks. I’m working on another DD to add to my GME EndGame series ([part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwb827/gme_endgame_dtc_infinity/), [part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0czgs/gme_endgame_part_2_cohen_market_cap_potential/)), but I wanted to take an aside to share my speculations on the obscene amount of manipulation happening this week by the shorts, and try to give all of you advice on how you can be more successful on GME.\n\n**TL:DR;** GME has tremendous potential and the only reason it’s not trading at $80+ is because of active shorting. Be aware about how your positions may be helping the shorts without you knowing.\n\n# How shorts manipulated GME this week\n\nI’m going to preface this by saying this is speculation based on events transpired and what I know about short tactics. Consider this a narrative of how a shorter could have orchestrated all of this. I will share data where I have it. For an understanding of some of those tactics, read this [great post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l11ww7/legacy_of_wsb_jim_cramers_crash_course_in_gme/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) by u/mirkan__2.\n\nImagine you’re one of the big shorts on GME. You’ve been shorting this thing since 2017, 2018, 2019 and watched its stock price drop from 30 -> 15 -> 4 to a low of $3 in 2020. If you’re Bank of America, your analysts are telling you (and others) this [thing is going to $1](https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/20/04/15848735/gamestops-short-term-sales-boost-to-power-down-soon-analyst-says).\n\nBut then things get out of hand, very quickly, with GME climbing from $3 -> $20 in 9 months and then in **ONE WEEK** doubling to $40. You were not prepared for this. It’s a disaster.\n\nWhat do you do? You leverage every tactic you can to drive the price down.\n\n**1) Attack retail investing capabilities:**\n\n* Bank of America owns Merrill Lynch. Merrill Lynch has a retail brokerage. Since you’re short GME, you have your risk department over at Merrill Edge **increase the margin requirements on GME** strongly and suddenly on all retail buyers.\n* **This causes a chain reaction**. Brokerages generally mimic the margin changes on other brokerages, because they don’t want to be the ones where all the “risky” traders go to. So other brokerages start increasing their requirements. Pretty soon, Schwab, Fidelity, Ameritrade, IBKR have all increased their margin requirements to the point that many buyers cannot buy more shares, or if they had bought on margin, need to liquidate or provide more capital.\n* Meanwhile, the big guys - banks and hedge funds that are short - use [prime brokerages](https://www.thebalance.com/what-is-prime-brokerage-4165497), and since I don’t have access to one I can’t confirm, but *very much doubt had any margin changes to GME.*\n\n**2) Manipulative shorting:**\n\n* On **Friday (1/15)** you take advantage of the fact that most call buyers on GME are not going to take assignment, so as they sell their calls which are now worth huge sums of money, Market-makers (MMs) are going to sell the shares they’re using to hedge the calls. So you short the stock as hard as you can, driving it down as low as 14% at one point, but it creates too strong of a sell-off triggering a short-sale restriction.\n\nGreat, at this point, you think you’ve killed some of the momentum going into the 3-day weekend. Hopefully investors will realize more of their mistake and sell off their foolish investment in the next Blockbuster. But then things go awry. Retail buyers are not shaken. In fact they’re enraged, and the GME movement grows more popular than ever, becoming the [most mentioned ticker](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l1ey7e/heres_a_visualization_of_the_tomorrows_moves/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) and even getting a stickied thread each day.\n\nThe US markets are closed on Monday. Doesn’t matter. Europe takes the mantle, driving the price up from 35 at close on Friday in the US to 40, then 44. **Mexico** picks up the baton, where it hits 1000 pesos, or **$50/share on Monday at 11:30 a.m.** before coming back down a bit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3y8c8fhixmc61.png?width=921&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e07fbb6fbd0fb39a15a0429d3096760ccf0556a\n\nYou’re about to get squeezed and you need to do something fast. You can’t short the price down Tuesday in US trading because of the short sale restriction, and the momentum behind GME is palpable.\n\nSo now you get more aggressive.\n\n**3) Orchestrated media attack & shorting:**\n\n* Here’s what you have to work with. There are **at least** **1.2 million** shares available to short in just IBKR, and more in prime brokerages thanks to all the retail buyers buying shares in Robinhood. [“Robinhood Securities earns income from lending margin securities to counterparties.”](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/how-robinhood-makes-money/#:~:text=Robinhood%20Securities%20earns%20income%20from%20lending%20margin%20securities%20to%20counterparties.) At a **54% borrow rate,** that’s quite a nice return for RH for holding your shares.\n* You call up a famous shorter known for impacting equity prices - Andrew Left of Citron. Offer him tons of money to put out a hit piece on Tuesday after markets open. It doesn’t matter that he doesn’t have shit prepared and you need him to do this tomorrow. He’s just going to threaten an attack to kill the momentum.\n* Tuesday market opens. GME **rockets up 25% to $45/share** within the first few minutes. Then comes the orchestrated attack.\n   * Minutes before Citron’s tweet, you buy thousands of OTM puts.\n      * **1000** 1/22 40p - **26 minutes before the tweet**\n      * **472** 2/29 20p - **24 minutes before the tweet**\n      * **2200** 1/29 30p - **11 minutes before the tweet**\n      * **424** 1/22 40p - **10 minutes before the tweet**\n      * **449** 1/22 40p - **5 minutes before the tweet**\n\n[Biggest option trades on the day of Citron’s tweet. Note that almost all of the large, long option orders are longer term, but the puts are all short term, with many coming minutes before the tweet. Keep in mind, while all this aggressive, OTM, short-term expiry put buying was happening, GME was rocketing upwards. It’s pretty obvious this was planned and not a response to price action. ](https://preview.redd.it/a9naysrkxmc61.png?width=939&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac257a1212129b1aa7d234a77cb563498a4d4fd8)\n\n* At 9:58 a.m. eastern (I’m on the west coast so timestamp is different), comes the tweet\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jupelyppxmc61.png?width=887&format=png&auto=webp&s=08dc187be8fdd580bd418c43f682e526e5c346d1\n\n* Note the language here:\n   * Citron’s not revealing anything until tomorrow, when short sale restrictions are done. *I.e. you better not buy today!*\n   * Price target of $20 **matching exactly the lowest strike price of the puts purchased just minutes prior**.\n   * “I understand short interest better than you” - i.e. “the shorts are paying me and I know who they are, and why they’re shorting”\n   * “Poker game” - ***he’s calling you a sucker, while at the same time tweeting a poker bluff***\\*\\*.\\*\\* He doesn’t actually have anything ready or substantial, but the shorts paid him off to threaten the market.\n* Andrew Left fired his shot. Now comes the coordinated shorting.\n* In about an hour, **all 1.2 million shares** in Interactive Brokers are used up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f6do9e7txmc61.png?width=894&format=png&auto=webp&s=1017e67af75f3f85fc98425aa5b6154b255cd5c1\n\n* Probably, prior to this, shorts used the invisible shares available from brokerages like Robinhood.\n* Wait, shorts can’t short on restricted days, right? **Wrong.**\n   * **They can short on the ask.**\n   * When there’s fear in the market, organic sellers lower their ask to exit their positions.\n   * Shorts high-frequency algos move their ask to match the lowest organic ask.\n   * Organic seller really needs to get rid of these shares! Citron is coming! Sees he’s now not the lowest ask, so he moves it down.\n   * Guess what? The algos match his ask and short at the lower price now.\n   * **This cycle repeats as long as organic sellers reduce their asks to sell.**\n* While all this is happening, **market makers are shorting/selling shares in response to the puts placed prior to the tweet,** helping push down the price.\n\nCongratulations. **In a matter of less than an hour, GME has now dropped from $45 to $37/share - an 18% drop and an** ***absolutely incredible reversal of momentum.***\n\nCitron didn’t even have to do shit. The next day they canceled their livestream claiming they *forgot about the fucking inauguration.*\n\n# How to be smart\n\nAs you can see, there are a number of dirty tricks here. It’s sophisticated, coordinated, and the odds are stacked against the retail investor.\n\nThere are some things you can do to trade smarter.\n\n* **OPEX.** Imagine if every trader out there took profits of their calls at expiration. In that scenario, MMs sell the shares they used the hedge the calls, leading to a downward drift in price. If instead people rolled forward winning calls, for example, MMs would not necessarily sell the hedge (depends on delta). Selling calls before expiry if you just want to take profits sometimes means you can avoid a drop on OPEX.\n* **Robinhood lends your shares and doesn't pay you for it.** Some other brokers let you choose to lend your shares. I know I can choose to lend shares or not in IBKR. It’s up to you to lend or not, but don’t let your broker lend for you and earn all that free lending money.\n* **Don’t sell on dips.** You’re only helping the shorts. If you need to sell to take profits, sell when it’s heading up. *Sell high, not low retards.*\n* **Save dry powder to buy on dips.** Dips manufactured by shorts are buying opportunities. Take advantage of folks with paper hands to capture shares at low points. GME has incredible daily volatility. Set a low limit buy and just wait for the order to fill. **Have patience when buying.**\n* **Don’t buy calls on rips.** With everyone expecting a squeeze *at any moment* option premiums that are already high rocket to insane levels in minutes. When Citron canceled their livestream GME started to recover, call premiums skyrocketed. You’re absolutely fucked if you buy calls on rips, even if you’re right. Look at this call premium price history for today and *imagine just how fucked you are if you buy calls on rips*:\n\n[Good luck profiting on calls if you buy on rips. ](https://preview.redd.it/hsofwiv5ymc61.png?width=705&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b7ee04c148c095e1f47613ded22844460fe768c)\n\n* **Don’t advertise when you’re going to buy. Just buy dips.** There were so many folks saying “wait for 11:30 to buy!”. Well, look what happened! Just when you thought there’d be a dip, and you were all ready to buy, there was this magical, temporary rapid price spike. Congratulations, advertised to every predatory trader out there when you all were going to buy. Double-win for them: If you fomo’d in at 41 you’re probably gonna paper hands your way out when the shorts push it back down.\n* **Don’t buy more than you’re willing to lose.** You need to hold through the dips, and be ok with the extreme volatility. IF you put too much into this all at once, you’re going to get scared when the price goes against you.\n* **Consider exercising DEEP ITM calls.** I love u/DeepFuckingValue but he could be making more from his portfolio. He has $2.6M in cash from prior GME winnings but also 1000 April 12 calls. The april 12 calls **are trading at intrinsic value.** Exercising those calls right now would use up $1.2M of capital and add 100K shares to his account, but 1) it would not change the PnL of the portfolio, 2) would increase the liquidity (you lose on spreads when you try to sell deep itm calls), and 3) **would allow him to choose whether or not to lend the shares.** Right now, MMs have hedged his calls with 100K shares, **but they're lending them to shorts and making free money.** In the case of DFV, that's about **$6000 per day** in free money given to market makers for the privilege of lending his shares to shorts. **If you have the cash, and the options trading at intrinsic, consider exercising.** Whether you lend is up to you, but **don't give MMs free money.**\n\n[u\\/DeepFuckingValue's Portfolio.
