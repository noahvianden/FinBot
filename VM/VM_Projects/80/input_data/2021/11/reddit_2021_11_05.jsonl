The point of this post was just to dig a bit deeper into the earnings to see if things are really as bad as the 30% drop would indicate. Short answer: I don't think things are nearly that bad and this could represent an amazing buying opportunity. Here's why.\n\n* Although the results missed expectations on a lot of metrics, they actually beat most of their own guidance from last Q. This shows that the company is beating the goals they set for themselves.\n* While growth has slowed, some slowdown is totally understandable coming off ridiculous pandemic growth. Like many other companies, they benefited substantially from pandemic shutdowns but that doesn't mean they are just a pandemic stock (see below).\n* While growth has slowed, they are still growing YoY - and that's impressive. Connected subs up 87%, digital subs up 74%, revenue up 6%, connected workouts up 55%. Considering they had a massive product recall and slashed the prices of their equipment, a 6% YoY revenue increase is nothing to sneeze at.\n* Twelve-month retention has remained steady at 92%, which means customers aren't leaving.\n* Guidance was conservative but they're still guiding for more growth: 42% quarterly growth in connected fitness subs, 4% revenue growth, with annual guidance of 15% revenue growth.\n* With the crash in the stock price, it is now trading at a forward P/S of 1.13.\n\nLooking at these results, I just don't reach the same conclusion as PTON bears who are claiming that this is the beginning of the end for the company. They are still growing, even when compared to pandemic quarters, they're just not growing as quickly as they did during the pandemic. If they were guiding for drops in key metrics, I would be seriously concerned.

They have really good retention rates (even pre-covid) and they want to get equipment in as many households as possible, hence the price cuts.  Peloton is all about subs.  And once you buy one, you don’t cancel your sub.  Of all the people I talk to that own one and don’t ride it, none have cancelled their sub.  That would be admitting defeat.  People join gyms and never go, but still pay because they ”may” go next month.  Same for Peloton, but more so.  That bike is starring you in the face everyday at home.  \n\nSubs are where its at, and their gross margin there keeps expanding.  At their lowered guidance, they will have around $1.7B in annually recurring sub revenue at 65-70% gross margin.  They expect that margin to expand to 75+% in future years as they leverage content costs across more subs.  Those are SaaS-like numbers.  Overall revenue growth is slowing, but subs are still increasing …. and by a lot.  The reduced guidance calls for Q2-Q4 subs growth of ~1,000,000, equivalent to that of last year, when people were sheltered in their houses during winter COVID surges.  \n\nThe revenue revision is mostly due to lower Connected Fitness sales dollars (not units).  I could care less about Connected Fitness Revenue (equipment sales dollars), because that is just the means of acquiring more subs.  Their goal is to pay for their CAC in full with the profit in equipment, but I don’t mind if this misses… as long as they still acquire the sub.  As addressed in the call, the revenue revision is due to the mix shift from Bike+ to Bike (more people than expected buying Bike because of price cut) and less Tread sales (mostly existing subs buying now and a small portion of overall sub adds).  If you look at the updated guidance closely, you’ll notice revenue was revised down 15% from the mid point, but subs were only revised down 6%.\n\nEven if US growth slows dramatically, they should be able to reach 5 millions subs just with their international expansion.  And don’t think subs are going to decrease.  Once a bike is in the wild someone will ride it.  Peloton doesn’t care if you resale it and someone else pays the sub.  They still get their money.  That would be $2.5B in high margin sub revenue.  Eventually and expectedly, the sub revenue will overtake the equipment revenue.  It reminds me a lot of Roku with their Platform rev vs Device rev.
