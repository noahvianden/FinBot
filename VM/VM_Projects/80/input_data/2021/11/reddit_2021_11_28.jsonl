{"title": "Tax loss harvest \"hack,\" is this not the most genius theta-gang shit ever???", "selftext": "Hey gang, so I've definitely been struggling with whether or not to tax-loss harvest my losers, but I feel like I've \"discovered\" a \"have your cake and eat it too\" hack of sorts... \n\nPlz lmk if anyone has done this or do I have things completely wrong. \n\nIn reviewing this document,  See Page 57 [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p550.pdf](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p550.pdf), it seems that a written options contract does not count towards a wash sale unless it is exercised. \n\nWhat this means to me is, potentially, I could realize all my losses on a stock like $PYPL, and immediately sell $PYPL puts, and so long as I don't get exercised within 30 days, it is NOT considered a \"wash.\" So I am looking at the Jan 21st monthly expiration. I THINK in order to avoid a wash on that date, I would have to realize my losses by Dec 21st as the last possible day. OR, potentially the Feb expiration could avoid that pitfall entirely if we are worried about exactly when exercise/assignment officially takes place. \n\nSo, is this not amazing? I'm bullish on $PYPL, I've been buying every dip like a clown, selling lots of puts, digging my grave deeper and deeper. I could realize all my losses YTD, offset my gains by that exact amount, and STILL benefit from being right on the stock by continuing that strategy, just so long as my short puts don't get exercised/assigned within 30 days, triggering a wash-sale. \n\nI am ready now to accept all of your lavish praise, stickers, and reddit gold, thank you", "id": "r4aslb", "created_utc": 1638124009.0, "score": 118, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 81, "comments": [{"body": "If you sell your PYPL stock to realize loses and it bounces up the short puts wont really help.
