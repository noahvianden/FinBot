I’ve seen ppl trying to do cross country trips in Tesla’s and where it would take 36 hours in a gas car, it takes 4 days because the charging time is so significant. Now how will that translate to semi’s with much larger battery capacity? Charge times? Long waits at semi charging stations? The massive builds you would have to do to alleviate the wait times? Doesn’t seem practical.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I don’t think it will, at least not until diesel prices skyrocket.  Not for the reasons you mention, but because of the simply cost of energy pricing.  Not kWh consumption pricing, but KW demand pricing.\n\nThe Megachargers Musk envisions as the solution to be able to charge these semis in a reasonable timeframe have a 1 megawatt power demand.  Go to your local electric utility’s website and look up their industrial demand pricing.  You can have an entire manufacturing plant run and have a demand less than half of that one charger.  A 1 MW demand could result in a bill of $20K per month… and that doesn’t include the actual power consumption, just the demand.\n\nNow picture a freight depot or truck stop that typically fuels dozens of semis simultaneously.  Let’s say they have 15 megachargers being used at the same time…. 15 MW peak demand…. that can be the same demand as a city of 8,000.  How is that truck stop going to pay their $250,000/mo power bill?\n\nAnd no, wind and solar is not the solution, nor are batteries like Musk would have you believe.  It would take 20 acres of solar panels to power one smallish interstate truck stop… thousands of acres to power a major truck stop that fuels hundreds of trucks simultaneously.  And that fueling continues 24/7, especially during the day when you would otherwise hope to charge batteries.  Solar and batteries can help with smoothing those charges, but won’t offset it entirely.  And how many gas stations want to buy up dozens or hundreds of acres to also run and maintain their own solar power plant?\n\nAnd think about the infrastructure needed to power that manufacturing facility or that small city to be able to safely and reliably provide the power draw required for such a large simultaneous demand.  Think about the sizes of those cables and transformers.  These truck stops would have upfront costs of hundreds of thousands of dollars to run those new massively oversized lines out to their remote locations along the interstates.  Less for freight depots in existing industrial areas, but still very large upfront costs.\n\nThe major truck stops have generators to keep power flowing to their fuel pumps during power outages.  With these, they’d be completely SOL if a truck hit a power pole, or a tree fell on a line, or some construction work cut a line.  They couldn’t power one mega charger with a standard backup generator, so they’d have a lot full of very pissed off truckers unable to fuel.  One widespread outage like we saw in Texas earlier this year would snarl the country’s supply chain.\n\nAnd of course something very basic that will make local day and LTL freight companies think twice, the truck is still heavy as shit when it’s coming back with an empty trailer.  Their one day range will be cut significantly since current routes are calculated with them delivering as much as possible with a trailer that gets lighter and lighter and comes back empty.  With a EV semi, even with an empty trailer the semi is still pulling the equivalent of a partially full trailer just by hauling its own depleted batteries.\n\nPower companies would LOVE to see these come to the roads.  The grid would have to be completely rebuilt in many rural areas where truck stops exist.  The truck stops (or government) will foot the bill for the construction, and their ratepayers will foot the bill for the ongoing maintenance.  The truck stops will pay them millions of dollars per year for power.  And utility shareholders will bathe in cash.\n\nBut the more likely reality is that freight companies continue to use diesel for 99% of their shipping and only purchase a few of these for PR.", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "Charging time in Tesla cars is not that long. \n\n“The Tesla Model 3 Long Range can charge from 10-80% in as little as 30 minutes from a 120kW Tesla Supercharger, while the Standard Range Plus will do it in even less than that.”\n\nThat’s 240 miles from 10-80%\n\nIf you stopped at 10% and charged to 80% every time. \n\nWashington DC to San Diego is 2,686 miles\n\nThat 11 stops to charge.
