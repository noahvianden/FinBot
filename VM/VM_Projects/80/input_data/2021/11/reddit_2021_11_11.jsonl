{"title": "Unlocking Hundreds of Billions (if not Trillions) in Value of $F and $GM", "selftext": " \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fs7gzbu5xvy71.jpg?width=419&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d3afdaaa3c81f33fe409e66212b230eae8fcc7ff\n\nOk, listen apes, let’s just put $TSLA aside for the sake of this argument as it is an outliner and I’m not saying $F nor $GM should be given a valuation similar to $TSLA. It’s obvious they can’t as they don’t have king Elon.\n\nToday, Rivian just went public (Nov 11th) and jump from $78 to over $100 per share valuing the company over $85B. It is worth more than $F ($77B) and as much as $GM($86B).  Even $LCID ($65B) is almost as valuable as $F. Yet, Rivian (and $LCID)  is operating at a loss, sold way less EVs than these two legacy auto companies, yet wallstreets are giving them a way higher and richer valuation than these two.\n\nSo what’s gives?  It appear wallstreets are not interested in their boring and old internal combustion engine (ICE) products, no matter how profitable they are.  As long as ICE are lumped into EVs, $F and $GM can never be seen as a tech and/or growth company as ICE is old technology. Since ICE currently generates the bulk of its revenue and profit, this makes it really hard (and confusing) for wallstreet to see them as a tech company to give it a higher valuation.  Therefore, to exponentially unlock hundreds of billions of dollars from these two, they need to be spun off, or split from their parent company. As you probably know by now, $GE is beginning to realize that and is planning to split in 3 after a couple decades of being a one-size fit all giant.  United Technologies split up a while back to become Otis, Carrier and Raytheon (through merger) and the sum of these 3 surely worth more than they are combined. \n\n**So How?**\n\nTake $GM as an example.  Morgan Stanley’s Adam Jonas once describe what he call “SPACtopus” (see image below) and how he believed if GM spin off any of these divisions, they’ll have discrete value and perhaps worth more separately.  ([https://finance.yahoo.com/news/morgan-stanley-sees-gm-spa-ctopus-taking-on-ev-market-185152539.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/morgan-stanley-sees-gm-spa-ctopus-taking-on-ev-market-185152539.html))\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t2uwsav9xvy71.jpg?width=705&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=47a1a737f5129f7f8a814e04a86ebd930bdd2b89\n\nObviously, the Cruise and EV/Ultium divisions at least would be given a higher valuation as they would be considered a growth tech.  As long as legacy businesses are lump in with the tech it is too hard for wallstreet to value the company as a whole.\n\nThe stand-alone EV division of $GM and  $F  SHOULD be worth more than Rivian. Now since even if $GM or$F spin off their EV division, this separate division will likely operate as a loss. So it would be hard to compare and value them with Rivian (also operating as a loss) on EPS. How about if we value them based on their sales or backlog of orders to show growth? After all, growth is what companies get reward for on wallstreets.\n\nNow for comparison sake, let's consider $F EV division only (excluding ICE, financial, etc) and Rivian.  Rivian  delivered so far.. 50? 60? trucks and have backlog order of 55,000 trucks + 100,000 Amazon vans.  $F have already delivered over 47,000 Mustang Mach E  EV to date and last month sold over 2,800+ Mache E.  Then there are 160,000+ pre-order/backlog for the F-150 Lightning and an unknown sold out number of electric Transit Connect.\n\nBased on the numbers of EV deliveries and backlog orders alone (forget about profit/revenue for now as both are likely to be unprofitable for the time being), without question $F EV as a stand alone company will be worth more than Rivian.  And on top of that all the other divisions of $F are just icing on the cake. As ridiculous as it may sound, $F EV division as a stand alone is worth even more than all the $F combined. Think about that for a second. Because as a combined company wallstreets find it really hard to evaluate $F growth. As a stand alone, wallstreets can see clearly how $F EV is growing compare to sat Rivian.\n\n**The Plan to Unlock Value in $F and $GM: Pull an ‘Eugine No. 1’**\n\nIf you don’t know what Eugine No. 1 is, they are an unheard of activist firm that took a tiny stake in Exxon Mobil $XOM and force it to fight climate change and reduce carbon emission. Really? Yes, and I’m not kidding:\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/03/engine-no-1-takes-climate-fight-to-other-big-oil-companies-after-underdog-win-at-exxon.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/03/engine-no-1-takes-climate-fight-to-other-big-oil-companies-after-underdog-win-at-exxon.html)\n\nThey do this by winning the proxy vote and elect directors/board seats who will advocate for the changes they want.  Now that Eugine No 1 has won out, $XOM has no choice but to come up with some plan to fight climate change.  Had Eugine No 1 not done this, $XOM would have not tried hard like other oil companies such as Shell or BP, going more green or investing in cleaner energies which both companies have.\n\nSo what we really need to do is pull an ‘Eugine No 1’. Somehow we need to put up a proxy vote. We could, but not necessarily nominate a board member, but can put up a resolution (i.e. spin off or separate EV business) which can also be impactful.  As shareholders we are owners of the company and publicly traded companies have to report to their shareholders. If a majority of shareholders agrees, it will force the company’s hand.  \n\nI can’t speak for everyone, but if those of you apes who agree with me that both $F and $GM is a value trap, we can help to unlock shareholder values by forcing the company to do so.  $GM may be easier to force to change as $F has a voting structure in which the family owns a huge chuck of votes.  However, even if we lose the proxy vote, any news/rumors of spinning off the EV division (even if it is not going to happen) will definitely push shares higher. So it is a win-win even if we win or lose.\n\nNow you apes have been known to do the impossible, like sending stocks that hedge funds and analysis say are worthless or a piece of shit ( $GME and $AMC ), to the moon.  We can do this, if enough apes buy shares in $F and $GM and someone proposes a spin-off on a proxy vote resolution.  If enough apes on /WSB agrees, we can make the changes and finally unlock hidden values in $F and $GM. I’m more than sure that there are a lot of other shareholders who agree, but we need an ape to pull an Engine No 1 to get the ball rolling.\n\nDisclaimer: Blah blah and blah, I’m not a financial advisor. I’m an ape with a laptop and an internet connection. No part of what I wrote should be construed as advice, and you should not take anything that is said here as investment or financial advice. \n\nDisclosure: I own $F, $GM and Rivian.", "id": "qrbnf5", "created_utc": 1636600966.0, "score": 88, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 82, "comments": [{"body": "That’s a lot of words.
