On these low priced stocks it’s easy to get a high % move but your puts are still way OTM.\n\nThere are multiple forces pushing and pulling on your contracts, not just the price of the underlying.  My guess is IV is the main culprit.  Not sure what it was when you bought but guessing it’s lower now.  Just a guess did you buy them before earnings?  Maybe close to but before earnings?  Earnings can pump up the IV and make contracts more expensive than they would otherwise be.

The more a stock is expected to move, the higher the probability that an OTM contract would go ITM, thus I’d expect a higher delta.  \n\nBut in this case you are through earnings so the probability of the stock dropping down to your strike soon isn’t as good as it might have been prior to earnings.  The current expected move by Oct 18 right now is about 4 points…but that is in either direction.  So the market is not confident you’ll get there.  You’re right at the expected move but that‘s generally not good enough to get paid much.  Now if the expected move was more like 8 or 10, vol would be higher and you‘re 4 point OTM put might be worth more.  You can also reverse that idea, that if the IV was higher the expected move would be higher.  It doesn’t really matter which way you look at it. \n\nI suppose the good news is you still have time.  But as you get closer to, say August, definitely September if you are still this far OTM, you may want to close it as time decay will be picking up considerably by then. Right now, it’s negligible  but it won’t be that way forever.  That’s the challenge of long options.  You can’t just be correct, you need to be correct as soon as possible.\n\nFar OTM contracts are lottery tickets. Right now you need a 50% drop to be ATM.

It's not the 21 day weighted average put/call ratio line is it?\n\n*Just a week ago, $SPX had broken down below support at 5260, and it seemed like the bears might be flexing their muscles. But it was a weak decline, which abruptly turned around on May 31st. $SPX quickly reached new all-time closing and intraday highs above 5340, and has been able to hold the new highs for two consecutive days. Thus, the $SPX chart is bullish, and that calls for a \"core\" bullish stance.*\n\n*There is support at or just below the previous highs, generally from 5260 to 5340. A close back below 5260 would be quite negative, for the prospect of this recent move to new highs being a false breakout would arise at that time.*\n\n*Equity-only put-call ratios continue to decline. That is bullish for stocks. It is worth noting that these ratios did not change direction at all when $SPX sold off a week ago; they have remained steadfastly on their buy signals throughout. Now, they are reaching the lower levels of their charts, which is an \"overbought\" condition for stocks. But it is not a sell signal. A sell signal will not arise until these ratios roll over and begin to trend higher.*\n\n***Breadth has been \"okay.\" The breadth oscillators rolled over to buy signals a week ago -- at the close of trading on May 31st -- and breadth has been just strong enough since then to maintain those buy signals. With $SPX breaking out to new all-time highs, we would expect to see breadth stronger than it is.***\n\n*$VIX has fallen back to nearly its lows. Thus the trend of $VIX buy signal that was established when the 20- day MA crossed below the 200-day MA remains in place (circled area on the chart in Figure 4). While a low $VIX is an overbought condition for stocks, it is not a problem for the stock market until $VIX begins to rise sharply. The warning sign of any significant kind would be if $VIX were to close above its 200-day Moving Average.*\n\n*So, we are holding a new \"core\" bullish position, in line with the bullishness of the $SPX chart. We will trade all the other confirmed signals that we get, around that \"core\" position. Currently, most of those signals are bullish, but things have a way of changing quickly.*\n\n ", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/breadthindicator.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/breadthindicator.asp)", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I tried the paper trades below and went -900 shares when naked calls got assigned, but there is no borrowing costs on my ThinkOrSwim simulation account for the borrowed shares.
