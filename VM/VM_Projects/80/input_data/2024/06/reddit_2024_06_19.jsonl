{"title": "Bears in a Bull Market", "selftext": "Bears… I’m genuinely confused by your tactic. Companies do absolutely everything in their power to make money. There’s competition which causes need for innovation, new employees, new ideas, and capitalization on new markets. We are in a bull market right now and I’m shocked that people are still buying puts. Why would you gamble against the people that are strategically growing their business (AAPL, NVDA, etc.)\n\nThis isn’t hate but I’m genuinely confused by the way bears think. Every post in the loss porn section is someone losing money from buying puts. Every complaint I see on here is from bears talking about how the markets going to crash. And it hasn’t. And even if it does, you would save a whole lot of money waiting for it, and then buying CALLS when everything is cheap and eventually grows again.\n\nI can’t understand someone betting against this market. I can’t understand hoping for a red day and betting against businesses, the economy, and every employee that works for NVDA, ARM, SMCI, SPY, AAPL, etc. I request every bear here to buy one call option on any stock of your choosing and see the thrill of actually WINNING. And not just that, winning with the company you’re betting on. Instead of winning when a company fails.

Who, then, is left to keep buying after the run-up?  The market falters, drifts down a little, has (steep) fake-out rallies, deteriorates, and finally depresses people.

When that fails they get even more depressed and start hating the stock market.  Sometimes, supposed \"haven\" investments don't do much better, as a lot of people start to need their CASH and sell every type.  Then the bear market eventually goes down to insane depths of despair, until a magic moment (sometimes called \"capitulation\") at the bottom.  Bear markets usually don't last as long as bull markets, but they can go down deep, over 60% down.  And they don't just hurt bad stocks.

Slogan: \"When NVDA starts to go, watch out below.\"**  That's not a specific price target or a date target, rather an if-then event target. Could be next week or a year away.  I'd also keep an eye on JPM; when \"best of breed\" falls, others fall more.  **Until then, bullish.**  (Aspen Aerogels and Abercrombie & Fitch are rising faster than Nvidia.)\n\nWhen the juncture finally seems to get near: NVDA puts?

Not sure you are serious though. In the event you aren't I can elaborate.
