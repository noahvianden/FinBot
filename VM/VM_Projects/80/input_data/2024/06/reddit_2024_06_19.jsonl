{"title": "Bears in a Bull Market", "selftext": "Bears‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm genuinely confused by your tactic. Companies do absolutely everything in their power to make money. There‚Äôs competition which causes need for innovation, new employees, new ideas, and capitalization on new markets.

Why would you gamble against the people that are strategically growing their business (AAPL, NVDA, etc.)\n\nThis isn‚Äôt hate but I‚Äôm genuinely confused by the way bears think. Every post in the loss porn section is someone losing money from buying puts. Every complaint I see on here is from bears talking about how the markets going to crash. And it hasn‚Äôt. And even if it does, you would save a whole lot of money waiting for it, and then buying CALLS when everything is cheap and eventually grows again.\n\nI can‚Äôt understand someone betting against this market. I can‚Äôt understand hoping for a red day and betting against businesses, the economy, and every employee that works for NVDA, ARM, SMCI, SPY, AAPL, etc. I request every bear here to buy one call option on any stock of your choosing and see the thrill of actually WINNING.

Who, then, is left to keep buying after the run-up?  The market falters, drifts down a little, has (steep) fake-out rallies, deteriorates, and finally depresses people.

Sometimes, supposed \"haven\" investments don't do much better, as a lot of people start to need their CASH and sell every type.  Then the bear market eventually goes down to insane depths of despair, until a magic moment (sometimes called \"capitulation\") at the bottom.

Good, even \"value,\" stocks go down too.\n\nThe current bull market followed a flood of three trillion new US dollars dumped from heaven; the flood has diminished but the effects continue.

My current guess is: **when businesses lose faith in Large-Language-Model-based AI, on which Nvidia now depends.  Slogan: \"When NVDA starts to go, watch out below.\"**  That's not a specific price target or a date target, rather an if-then event target. Could be next week or a year away.  I'd also keep an eye on JPM; when \"best of breed\" falls, others fall more.  **Until then, bullish.**  (Aspen Aerogels and Abercrombie & Fitch are rising faster than Nvidia.)\n\nWhen the juncture finally seems to get near: NVDA puts?
