Knew about it for years.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Disproving the assertion requires examining the claims about Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB), GEICO, Berkshire Hathaway Energy (BHE), and the implications of a high-level executive moving to a Musk company. Here's a counterargument:\n\n1. **GEICO's Float as the Main Source of Liquidity for Buffett's Investments**:\n   - **Counterargument**: While GEICO's float is indeed a significant source of liquidity for Berkshire Hathaway, it is not the sole or even the main source of funds for Buffett's investments. Berkshire Hathaway has multiple sources of liquidity, including cash flow from its various operating businesses, dividends from its stock portfolio, and other insurance operations. For example, Berkshire Hathaway's other insurance companies, like General Re and Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, also contribute to the company's overall float and liquidity.\n\n2. **Berkshire Hathaway Energy's Management Compared to Most US Utilities**:\n   - **Counterargument**: While Berkshire Hathaway Energy is recognized for its effective management, it is not necessarily superior to all other US utilities. The performance and management efficiency of utilities can vary widely based on factors such as regulatory environments, regional market conditions, and specific management practices. There are other well-run utilities in the U.S. that also demonstrate strong management and operational efficiency.\n\n3. **Implications of a High-Level Executive Moving to a Musk Company**:\n   - **Counterargument**: The movement of a high-level executive from a Berkshire Hathaway company to a Musk company does not necessarily indicate a need for Berkshire to reconsider its stance on Musk or his companies. Executives often move between companies for various reasons, including career opportunities, personal interests, or differences in corporate culture. This does not automatically imply that Berkshire Hathaway's strategy or perspective on Tesla or Musk needs reevaluation.\n\n4. **Partnering with Tesla Energy for Grid Stabilization**:\n   - **Counterargument**: While partnering with Tesla Energy to use MegaPacks for grid stabilization could be beneficial, it is not the only or necessarily the best solution for Berkshire Hathaway Energy. BHE has its own strategies and investments in renewable energy, energy storage, and grid management. There are multiple technologies and approaches to grid stabilization, and BHE may find alternative solutions that align better with its long-term strategy, regulatory considerations, and operational goals. Additionally, building peaker plants may still be a necessary component of a comprehensive energy strategy in certain regions or circumstances.\n\nIn summary, while GEICO's float, BHE's management, executive movements, and potential partnerships with Tesla Energy are noteworthy, the claims made in the assertion can be challenged based on a broader understanding of Berkshire Hathaway's diverse sources of liquidity, the relative performance of other utilities, the reasons behind executive moves, and the multiple strategies available for grid stabilization.", "score": -1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "lol except for almost doubling my insurance rates in a year.
