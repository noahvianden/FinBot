And given that you read *Intrinsic*, you're not stupid.  Want the secret?  \n\n*Don't sell at a price **below** your long Calls.*  That's it.  (There are some nuances if the two strikes are close, but that won't be your case.)  Watch:  \n\nYou own the right to buy Nvidia at 60.  Because you control those shares, you can dangle a carrot in front of someone's face that you're pretty confident they won't be able to reach.  \n\nYou'd say to me in your best used-car dealer impersonation, \"Hey Mike, you think Nvidia's going to keep powering up, right?  Well have *I* got a deal for *you!*  Do you think it might be at 148 4 weeks from now?  You do?  Oh, you think it might even be 155?  Cool, then I tell you what:  you give me $198 today, and if NVDA is at or above 148 on July 12th, I'll sell you 100 of my shares at 148.  Deal?\"  \n\nDo you see what all is packed into that?  You're selling me *hope*.  And you're selling me the convenience of not having to buy 100 shares today and just waiting for that rise.  And you're selling me the worry-free knowledge that I don't have to hold the stock and risk it going down:  *you're* taking on that risk.  But you were gonna do that anyway.  \n\nWhy did I pick the 148 strike?  Because I took the Expected Move for the 12July expiration, $14.42, added it to spot, 131.88, and got 146.30.  Then I rounded up to 147.  But in this case there's not a 147 strike so I went up even further to 148.  That 148C is at 22-delta, so about a 78% chance it won't expire ITM.  \n\nWhat did you make on that deal?  My premium, $1.98, over your collateral $79, which gives a return of 2.5% in a month, 30% apy.  \n\nThat return didn't come out as high as I thought it would, but you *really* get to divide by what you *paid* for those Calls, not what they're worth *now*, but I don't know that figure.  \n\nBut sell this same Call against the 180-day 90-delta long Call I described in my previous post, which we might buy Monday for 48.30.  Now your return is 4.1% in a month, or 49% apy, and that's serious money.  \n\nOr sell it against the 96DTE 20Sep97C at 38.38 and make 62% apy.  \n\nAnd if you've got the time and inclination, sell *weekly* Calls against that 3m call and make 117% apy.  Yes, that's crazy, but the math is right.  And guess what?  We haven't even accounted for your long Calls appreciating as NVDA rises.  \n\nAnd here's the coolest thing:  If NVDA *doesn't* rise, your long Calls don't either.  They just sit there; and actually they start *losing* that 5-10% time premium you paid for them.  BUT, by selling Calls against those Calls, you're making money on them, *whether they go up or not*.  It's truly a beautiful thing.  (I do the same with stock:  don't let it just *sit* there, make it earn its keep.)  \n\nOkay, so why do people say you can \"lose\" by selling Calls against your stock or Calls?  What they mean is that you can lose opportunity cost, that's all.  You'll still have made a buttload of money.  Check it out:  \n\nNvidia is at 131.88 on this Sunday.  Say you sold me that 148C earlier for a month from now.  Now let NVDA be 150 at the end of the month.  I exercise the Call option you sold me and 'take' your shares at 148.  Did you 'lose' money?  No!!  You *made* the appreciation from 132 to 148, $16.  PLUS the $1.98 I paid you.  \n\nSo you made $18/per share on NVDA in 4 weeks.  Divide that by the current value of your Calls, $79 (you really get to base it on your cost basis, but I don't know that number), and you just made 22% in a month.  Should you be happy with that?  (The answer is yes.)  \n\nAnd if you still like Nvidia, simply buy another Call  and do it again!  And this would give you an opportunity to come in closer in strike and/or expiration, for more leverage than you had before.  It's  really a win/win.   \n\nBut wait, there's more:  *you don't have to let your shares (Calls) get called away.*  \"I don't?\"  No, you can *buy that sold Call back.*  Sure, you'll have to pay more for it than you sold it for, and people call that a \"loss,\" but it's really not:  \n\nYour long Call was increasing at 0.92% of the rate of the stock, while the short Call was increasing at something like 40, or 50, or 60% of the rate, depending on when you act on it.  So in effect, you're paying maybe \"50\" to buy \"92\".  You'll see what I mean when it happens to you:  whatever you pay to close the short Call you more than \"get back\" because you've uncapped your long Call.  \n\nSell another Call at 20 delta or so (or go even further out for less premium), and maybe that one will stay in bounds.  That's what people mean when they say \"roll up (in strike) and out (in time).\"  It's routine, and it just means that your long Call is making more money than expected, and that's a good problem to have.  \n\nSo anyway, watch some TastyTrade or InTheMoney YT videos on it and figure it out.

Now slide up the Call option chain (to the *lower* strikes) until you get to the first one with a delta of 1.00.  The markets are closed right now, so prices are stale, but somewhere around the 70 Call.  \n\nThe Bid/Ask on those is 62.20/62.85, for a Midpoint of about 62.53 if you were to buy one tomorrow.  \nNvidia closed at 130.98, so divide that by 62.53 to get about 2.1.  \n*That's the leverage that spending half the money for the 1.00-delta option gives you.*  \n\nThink about it:  at 1.00 delta, that option is supposed to move dollar-for-dollar as NVDA moves.  And how do you calculate rate of return?  Usually by dividing a price increase by the cost of the thing that increased.  \n\nSo if NVDA goes up by $1, that's an RoR of 1/130.98 = 0.7%  \n\nBut when your Call option goes up by $1 (which it will because it's tracking 1:1 with NVDA), the denominator is smaller, making the answer bigger:  1/62.53 = 1.6%  \n\nDo you see it?  For the same dollar move, you make 1.6% vs. 0.7%.  \n\nAnd I just used that as an example of a low-risk trade.  But with NVDA steadily going up, I've been buying the 1-month 80-delta Calls.  Right now that's about the 19Jul118C for 15.90.  \n\nWhoa!  15.90 is a *whole* lot less than 62.20.  What does that do for leverage?  Stock price divided by Call price:  130.98/15.90 = 8.2x leverage  \n\nActually a bit less than that because the value of the Call only increases 80 cents for every dollar move in NVDA, but it's still huge.  (I guess you'd do 0.8 x 8.2?  About 6.5x?)  \n\nSo the crux of the thing is:  you can buy 100 shares at full price, or you can sort of rent them for much less by buying a Call.

Add the cost to the strike to get the Breakeven price for this trade:  12.22 + 125 = 137.22  \n*I need NVDA to get to 137.22 within 31 days to break even on this trade.*  \n\nWhy so high?  Because of the time premium I had to pay for.  Subtract the stock price from that cost basis:  137.22 - 133.28 = $3.94.  \nThat's $4 that's going to decay away over the life of the option.  So we need NVDA to go up by $4 to pay for that.  \n\nFollow all that?  It's fundamental that you see that.  \nNow let's flip it to the OTM side of the game.  \n\nSay you want to spend that same $3.94 on an OTM Call option that I had to pay for time value in my ITM Call.  \nYou'd be buying the 143C at 34 delta for 3.80.\n\nWhat did you just buy?  Time.  That's it.  Time and hope, but no *Intrinsic* value, only *Extrinsic* value.  Time/volatility/uncertainty value.  But you're right:  you paid less for that OTM Call than I did for my ITM Call.  \n*But did you really?*  \n\nBecause most of the money *I* paid went to Intrinsic Value:  my Call is physically worth how deep ITM it is.  I won't lay out the numbers, but if I own a Call that's $10 ITM, that Call is worth *minimum* $10.  *And it's worth more and more as NVDA goes up.*  \n\nWhat happens to your OTM Call as NVDA goes up.  Nothing, really. Sure, it gains some from becoming closer to the money, and people become more hopeful about it, but it also loses value due to time.  \n\nOh, I should've started here:  what's your Breakeve?  Premium plus strike:  3.80 + 143 = 146.80\n*You'd need NVDA to get to almost 147 to even start making money on the trade.*  Will it get there?  Probably.  But what if it only goes to 148?  (Which happens to be about where the Expected Move puts it.) \nYou made 1.20.  $120.  You risked $380 to make $120, not a great risk:reward profile.  \n\n**Now here's the important part:**  \n*What did my ITM Call do in that time?*  At NVDA 148, you subtract my Call's strike price, 125, to get $23.  \nMy Call option is worth $23 at expiration (your OTM Call was worth $1).  I put in $1222 that at the end was worth $2300.  A profit of 1078, so an ROI of 88%.  **In one month!**  \n\nThat's the part that's so huge about these:  insane returns in short periods of time, and relatively safely.
