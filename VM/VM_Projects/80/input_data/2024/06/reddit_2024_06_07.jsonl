I believe they also either offer or require a 5 year software license when purchasing GPUs (or something along those lines), and if a company buys them, and spends 5 years working on them with Nvidia‚Äôs software, they‚Äôre not gonna wanna have to learn a whole new language or whatever if they switch to a different GPU.
