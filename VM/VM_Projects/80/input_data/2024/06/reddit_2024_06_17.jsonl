Anyone who combats that doesn't have facts and doesn't realize the first mover advantage that generated .\n\nUnfortunately the advantage of first mover has worn off, it's been 8+ years. The BYD Seagull gets 240 miles of range and costs 8K, even with a 100% tariff it's still cheaper then a model 3 base. I'd say Tesla has actually fallen behind to a cheaper car\n\nThis is where promise vs deliverance comes into play because now we have to talk outlook. Historically the data would support  Elon hypes and doesn't deliver for a long time on his promises and when they do it is generally a QC/QA nightmare and 80% of what was originally promised.\n\nI think in a vacuum automation, self driving, robo taxis, AI etc all sound great, but I think it's unreasonable to believe Tesla has some sort of inherent advantages in these or can somehow revolutionize these areas.\n\n\nLet's start with self driving, Tesla is actually on level 2+ autonomous driving whereas Mercedes is the first to reach level 3 on the road.  What's Tesla's advantage? They were supposedly the leader in this but got passed up by a OEM in a shorter time frame. Am I supposed to believe they've been holding back or is it more reasonable to believe musk promised beyond their capabilities\n\n\nRobo taxis, actually you can get a robo taxi from waymo in Santa Monica and GM in parts of Arizona. This would indicate to me they're ahead in that space, where is Tesla's advantage when they're not a leader in the area?\n\nAutomation, not exactly new frankly, it's every day life in factories - hell Amazon packaging warehouses have some of the most insane automation you will ever see.  If we're talking specifically hominoid robots then Boston Dynamics is the leader here and actually has units in service.  I fail to see Tesla's advantage here when they're still trying to train their robots to fold clothes\n\n\nAI - I'm sorry Chatgpt is the leader here and I don't see that changing with Microsoft propelling them and companies starting to adopt and pay for copilot(Chatgpt derived). Tesla is literally starting from ground zero on this against many of these larger companies. Also musk already has xAI, conflict there\n\n\nTo add the cherry on top I'm now supposed to believe Tesla will dominate in all these categories and still make a cheaper car.....\n\n\nI give credit where credit is due but let's talk reality here, Tesla cannot be a cure all for every hot tech topic - and Elon has never delivered in time - that inherently means whatever of the above he promised today is still years upon years out till a product when other companies already have products today", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Ripped off from another Reddit user, but...\n\n\"Here’s the big differences between Tesla fsd & Mercedes drive pilot\n\n1) Mercedes drive pilot can only operate in highways whereas Tesla fsd will work on both highways & city streets\n\n2) The speed limit on Mercedes drive pilot is 40mph max whereas Tesla fsd is 85mph, here Mercedes drive pilot needs to follow other vehicles whereas in Tesla case it is not required to follow other vehicles.\n\n3) Regarding the traffic patterns Mercedes is not capable of handling interchange whereas Tesla fsd is capable of most of the traffic patterns\n\n4) Mercedes drive pilot doesn’t work with flashing lights in the area, meanwhile Tesla fsd functions with flashing lights\n\n5) Mercedes drive pilot doesn’t work in construction zones, Tesla fsd operates in the construction zones\n\n6) Mercedes drive pilot usage in day time only whereas Tesla fsd can work in daytime or nighttime use\n\n7) Mercedes drive pilot cannot change lanes whereas Tesla fsd can change lanes\n\n8) Mercedes drive pilot needs the lane lines whereas for Tesla fsd lane lines is not required\n\n9) Mercedes drive pilot is functioning only in California & Nevada whereas Tesla fsd in all 50 states, Tesla in the last 24hr Tesla has launched subscriptions for Enhanced Autopilot (EAP) in China, as many expect that the company could soon launch its Full Self-Driving (FSD) in the country\"\n\nPeople claiming Mercedes is ahead aren't paying any attention. Furthermore, achieving Level 3 basically just shifts liability onto the company. It isn't a massive departure from Level 2 from a technical standpoint.\n\nIn the end, we will see what happens with Tesla. Everyone hates Musk, but he's one of the best capital allocators, and one of the most ambitious and imaginative leaders in any space. The risk/reward is very high with this approach. If you compare a company like Tesla to something like Apple, it's very clear to see how differently they approach innovation. Apple stays in its lane, makes incremental changes, does not have large departures. They talked about an Apple Car, but ultimately scrapped that plan.\n\nTesla on the other hand went from having ONE vehicle mostly assembled by hand, to having a line of vehicles, a huge overhaul in automation and robotics, energy storage, charging networks that are being built out faster than all others combined, AI training models, billions of miles of driving data, and now humanoid robots. Will it all work out? Who knows, but to doubt a person and a company who has done all that is absolutely dumb. All we have is evidence that they can achieve amazing things, albeit not quite on time.

The Mercedes system is level 3 because if something goes wrong Mercedes will be liable. Tesla assumes no risk if there is an accident, using their \"Full Self Driving\" is at your risk not theirs. \n\n\nLastly cause this is getting long, your thesis statement is we can't bet against them because they are taking huge risks no one else is willing to do and had a proven track record because they built tesla.  This is false, scaling up is NORMAL for any company with a new product for the market. You could apply the literal hand built to automation to every manufacturing company at its infancy to it's maturity. \n\nI recognize musk made a great play on EVs and even finding a way to make shooting things up into space cheaper but why does that make him the Messiah on AI,.or robotaxis, or robots which he is jumping on the bandwagon to.

The progress made so far has looked exponential, but you're right that technology tends to follow an S curve.\n\nIt may be that you don't have much of an imagination though too. Is technology required to follow an S curve? Is it a written law? It's actually not set in stone that we must follow some kind of curve, it's just what we have observed most of the time with technology. A lot of the time people get hung up on S curves for adoption, but that's not a good baseline since there is a finite number of humans. If we are talking about AI we have several ways to improve. Chips have been improving steadily, more capital is flowing in, a higher number of chips are being deployed, new technologies (AI) are beginning to feed themselves as well which only stands to steepen the curve.\n\nAnyway, I'll just go ahead and grant you that AI will follow and S curve.

Example: YOLO uses MSE for bounding box coordinates and cross-entropy for class probabilities.\n* **Image Segmentation:** Uses Dice coefficient loss, cross-entropy loss, or a combination. Example: Dice loss measures the overlap between predicted segmentation and ground truth.\n\n**Decision-Making and Planning:**\n\n* **Reinforcement Learning (RL):** Uses Temporal Difference (TD) loss or Policy Gradient loss. Example: Q-learning uses TD loss to minimize the difference between predicted and target Q-values.\n* **Imitation Learning:** Uses behavioral cloning loss (e.g., MSE or cross-entropy). Example: MSE loss minimizes the difference between the robot’s actions and human expert actions.\n\n**Motor Control:**\n\n* **Trajectory Optimization:** Uses the sum of squared errors between predicted and desired trajectories. Example: PID controllers use MSE to adjust motor commands.\n* **Inverse Kinematics:** Uses MSE between predicted and target end-effector positions. Example: MSE minimizes the error in the robot’s hand position and orientation.\n\n**NLP and Communication:**\n\n* **Language Generation:** Uses cross-entropy loss for predicting the next word in a sequence. Example: Language models like GPT use cross-entropy loss.\n* **Language Understanding:** Uses cross-entropy loss for classification tasks like intent recognition. Example: Cross-entropy is used for training classifiers to understand commands.\n\n**Multimodal Tasks:**\n\n* **Sensor Fusion:** Uses custom loss functions combining errors from multiple sensors.

{"title": "Plan to short TSLA", "selftext": "Why:\n\nTesla sales have been slowing and tesla inventory has been building. This is apparent from reports of inventory build up around their factories, Q1 reporting, layoffs, and the April 2nd update.  The following site also shows an inventory increase but I do not trust this source entirely since some of the basic functionality on this site is broken. [https://tesla-info.com/blog/inventory-stats-regional/Global?q=4#google\\_vignette](https://tesla-info.com/blog/inventory-stats-regional/Global?q=4#google_vignette)\n\nThe recent tesla layoffs (late April) were a crossed the board and un-structured; reported as \\~10% of the workforce. I suspect that it may have been larger than that but have nothing to back that up. They were un-structured as employees were given no notice and some key divisions were let go in mass (supercharger team) which were later brought back on. Employees were given 2 months of severance pay to prevent a WARN act lawsuit. Payment was scheduled to go out 45 days after termination. All in all we can expect that for this quarter payroll will be approximately unchanged for Q2 reporting while production efficiency will have been reduced by more than 20% (reduced moral, key employees will have been let go, other employees will need retraining to fill vital roles). this means less than 80% of the work for 100% of the pay which means reduced margins in Q2.\n\nSpeculation: Tesla does not have updated models that would entice current model 3/Y (their bread and butter) owners to buy a new Tesla. Most people who wanted a Tesla have already bought one. Competition in the EV market is building; many auto makers now have EV's available that are more attractive to the every day driver.\n\nTesla is way behind now on autonomous vehicles. Waymo is already online in Phoenix and San Francisco and is being brought online in LA. Tesla rejected radar and lidar technology which is rapidly decreasing in cost. GM, Hyundai, BMW and other manufactures already have level 2 advanced cruise control (this is what FSD is) online. BMW will be releasing a level 3 ACC soon. Tesla dropped the ball and is already late to the market for fully autonomous cars and is falling behind on level 2 ACC. \n\n [https://www.bmwblog.com/2023/07/26/bmw-level-3-self-driving/](https://www.bmwblog.com/2023/07/26/bmw-level-3-self-driving/)\n\nTesla's robot, optimus, has not been shown to do anything useful beyond acting as a pick and place machine (these have existed since the 80's). Optimus can barely walk and is far behind Boston Dynamics (mostly owned by Hyundai). Optimus is a dead end and a pipe dream; Tesla is many years behind other companies and it's not clear if this technology will be useful considering the competitive wages of overseas workers. \n\nAfter the vote last week TSLA shot up in the pre-market then fell on Thursday and Friday. My guess is that a few, or even one, large share holder was backing out of Tesla; this was expected since this was a very divisive vote. The fan boi's have been pushing Tesla stock hard lately and although I have no proof I suspect that many influencers on youtube, twitter, and main stream media are somehow profiting through a back door means to pump Tesla and have been for some time. I have the feeling that most of us, or at least the people who have enough control to actually move markets, are seeing through Elon's BS and just need a catalyst to take a closer look and drop TSLA from their portfolio's.\n\nWhat:\n\nI plan to use \\~10% of my portfolio to buy out of the money puts on 1JUL24 expiring 19JUL24. Strike price should be about -10% from stock price at that time. Depending on the severity of the 2JUL24 report from Tesla I may see either a sudden drop or a slow decline in the stock price leading into 17JUL24. After market on 17JUL24 I am expecting another drop and will close my position at market open 18JUL24 with out regard to price.\n\n", "id": "1dhou8r", "created_utc": 1718595417.0, "score": 55, "upvote_ratio": 0.77, "num_comments": 103, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 1 | **First Seen In WSB** | 1 week ago\n**Total Comments** | 5 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 3 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Be a bear, but be a smart bear.

Tesla's implementation autonomous driving was abandoned by everyone else many years ago as it was found to be unsafe and unreliable; this is only suitable for SAE level 2 at most. They are also training on consumer drivers were as competitors are only using training data derived from professional drivers + using a driving simulator (garbage in = garbage out no matter how much data you have). They have not yet applied for legal permission anywhere to use an SAE level 3, 4, or 5 system. the current level 4 systems in operation are geofenced and speed limited for safety; Tesla would be required to follow these guidelines as well. No level 5 systems currently exist. \n\nThis is all really a moot point though; most Tesla owners did not buy autopilot/FSD and most drivers drop the subscription after the 1 month trial. Even if they achieved level 5 FSD it's not clear how profitable it would be since it is being sold as an add-on for a car sale (guessing it would be about as profitable as current systems are now). It's not clear if robotaxi's will be profitable either. These taxi's will still need maintenance (daily cleaning at least). For a service like Uber the driver would be on the hook for all of these expenses; with robotaxi's Tesla will be. Consumer cars will not be on the robotaxi network no matter what Elon says; imagine the insurance nightmare.
