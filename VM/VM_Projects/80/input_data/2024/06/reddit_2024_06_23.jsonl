However in terms of cost and manufacturability, use of rare earth metals‚Ä¶ different story.\n\nTesla is close yet far more manufacturable. When you look at the entire set of competition Tesla is far ahead of most. Lucid can produce better motor and efficiency, but at what cost. \n\nNobody is saying Toyota makes faster cars than Bugatti vehicles. But nobody is arguing that Bugatti is years ahead. \n\nEngineering something manufacturable is far more difficult. So when they say they are a year or two ahead in technology‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not sure the entire equation is taken into account.

If that‚Äôs the comparison I sure hope lucid is more than a few years ahead. \n\nBut you can generalize a lot from both cubertruck and the new model 3 performance , which is exceptionally reviewed by car enthusiasts.\n\nI‚Äôm guessing, personal speculation,  we will be seeing 48v, steer by wire and rear steer on S and X in 2025/2026 along with other power train updates.\n\nBut to your battery chemistry discussion, nmc is a good performer if managed correctly. Porche just switched to NMC for their latest Taycan for example. Battery chemistries all have tradeoffs in cost, complexity, density, performance, longevity and safety. Lucid uses NCA I believe which has its tradeoffs compared to nmc as well.  \n\nThere is a lot more to a battery pack than just the chemistry.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "The Cybertruck is highly reviewed???
