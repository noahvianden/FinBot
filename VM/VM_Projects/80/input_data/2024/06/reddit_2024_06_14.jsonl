If, by hypothesis, for some weird reason all the people that hold NVDA decide that they are going to sell NVDA stocks only for 200$ or more… and then someone buys NVDA for that stock (because you always have regards) then that’s the last traded price and the market cap will reflect that jumping from 3T to 4T.
