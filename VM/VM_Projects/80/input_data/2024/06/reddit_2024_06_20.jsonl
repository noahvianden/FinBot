It’s hard to figure out how people are using these advancements in their workflows, but it’s very easy to see that *someone* is buying. In my experience as a data scientist, I’ve noticed the biggest value additions from “ai” (data modeling) advancement is coming from enhancing developer support, and augmenting the effectiveness of data entry and audit teams.

The same is true for auditors, and data entry workers who are getting trimmed down to a few workers who spot check a learning CV model rather than ten workers doing it using ad hoc analysis.

If you need numbers, google it yourself because I’m not going to do your homework for you, but if you are expecting ai to bubble because you think people are promising advanced chat bots that they won’t deliver on, well, that’s not the case.
