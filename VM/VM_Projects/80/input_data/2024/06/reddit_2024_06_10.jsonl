I'm not an accountant, but I do have a CPA.\n\nHere's my take: Options are way better than RSUs.  RSU's hit your account and you are liable for the taxes on your W2 as salary.  You can sit on the options and exercise before they expire.  RSUs also shift a lot of the tax burden to the employee.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "You have to purchase the options, and if/when you exercise them, you have to pay tax on the value of the stock you receive upon exercising. So the tax burden isn't a factor, Uncle Sam gets his cut no matter what.\n\nThe reason options suck is because you have to put up the money to buy them. Granted, it's probably not a lot of money, but if you got straight RSU's you wouldn't have to put up any money. \n\nAlso, you have to exercise the options before they expire, so you're on the clock. If your company is private and you exercise your options and receive the shares, that's a taxable event since the shares count as income. But since the company is private, you can't sell the shares. So you've put up a ton of money to buy and exercise options, but you haven't received anything liquid. With RSU's, most of them have a double trigger vest. Meaning you are assigned shares, but they don't technically receive them until the company IPO's. So you don't have to worry about tax until after the shares become liquid, after which you just sell a portion of the shares to cover the tax liability. \n\nI've had friends working at private companies and they had multiple 6 figures worth of options that were set to expire. And they had to either let the options expire (meaning throw away a portion of their compensation ), or exercise them and pay the tax bill out of pocket. And then wait years before they could sell the shares to get the money back.\n\nSome private companies will hold liquidity events for their employees so they don't get fucked over. They basically go out and find new private investors and sell them the employees shares so the employees get liquidity and the new investor gets shares. \n\nWhen I worked at a private large tech company that shall remain unnamed, I had random Chinese companies hitting me up offering to buy the shares for 30 cents on the dollar.
