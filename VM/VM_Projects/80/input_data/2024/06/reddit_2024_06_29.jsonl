Plus TSMC relies on other companies in other countries, they are not self sufficient, and those countries will put China at an ultimatum. It would be a bad decision for China to shutdown the plant, so even after a China takeover I doubt TSMC  chip production would be effected much, at least initially. Although I have heard if a China takeover occurs, TSMC has emergency protocol, that could shut down progress, and prevent China from taking over, and keeping the chips to themselves and/or blocking them from the US. Who knows they could have some crazy explosive setup in case they need to disable the fad, like in the movies. This info about the protocol was provided by someone from TSMC, like the owner or someone high in charge, you can search for the article.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Ya but that's not gonna work.

As soon as China attacks Taiwan, there will be embargo on trade with companies in Europe, and the US, that TSMC requires to operate. There might be some parts/materials left, but after a year or two, TSMC will run out of everything they need to operate. I don't think people will just \"forget\" what happened very easily as well, and I doubt China will be able to nationalize TSMC very quickly just like that. This is also the reason China has made many threats, but has yet to take over Taiwan. I think someone else also mentioned, TSMC has a doomsday protocol intact, and I'm sure it is quite easy to destroy years of progress within a short amount of time, given how sensitive everything in that place is. Plus don't forget, by attacking Taiwan, the US, Japan, and other countries will most surely defend and come to help. Let's not forget that. So, it's not as simple as just walking into TSMC, and nationalizing it. You have to deal with explosions, and shit like that first, probably aimed directly at the fab. No way the US would let China take that fab. Let's not get into the geographical intricacies of an all out war with China, but let just say China is very dependent on a few trade routes that will get most surely get cut off. It's funny to me because they have all this money, but they can't make their own fab, they have to try to steal it from another country.
