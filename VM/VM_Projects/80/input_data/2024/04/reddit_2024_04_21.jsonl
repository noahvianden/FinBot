I've heard puts should be within 30 days because market tendency to move up but here I feel differently. For NVDA I would eye the 6/21 puts (the IV on them is also half). Here's my reason:\n\n- Tech companies really need to deliver and imo other than PLTR, most have a weak AI game. Co-pilot is a disappointment in it current form and other don't have a realistic offering. A lot of them are over valued.\n\n- NVDA is closely tied with everything-AI, you can see how ASML, TSM, SMCI affect it day to day\n\n- SMCI reports a bad earning on 4/30. The non release of pre-earnings already gave a glimpse.\n\n- NVDA reports 5/22 and expectations are massive, so even with good they might under-perform and I feel that would be a miss as well.\n\n- Then comes the economic factors in this time frame up till 6/21. GDP/PCE (Apr 25/26). Fed Interest rate decision May 1. PPI MoM May 14. Inflation MoM May 15. Same indicators in June.\n\n- The middle east war news reports that come have not helped as well\n\n- We are also approaching in that price range vicinity where profit takers would like to pull out (\\~$675, \\~615, $475)\n\nIn all this time-frame there is only one thing that could course correct, that would be the Fed Interest rate decision on May 1. Even with a good tech ER week, market direction will hinge on that.\n\nThe narrative for now still seems to be 2 rate cuts. However, the GDP data forecast for next week is already low at 2.9%. Based on this months inflation data, I dont think the rate cuts can be announced.
