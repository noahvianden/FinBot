This would sacrifice safety in common scenarios to benefit uncommon scenarios.\n\nAdding 2 headlight cameras while keeping the B-Pillars = lower global fps = worse high-speed object estimation = lower precision high speed decision-making = worse global high-speed safety. I've already gone over the sole benefit of headlight cameras, but in this case it's diminished because of reduced fps, making it worse at high-speed inferences (exactly the thing it needs to do well here).\n\nYou're arguing that there can be no safety compromises while promoting a design change that would just compromise safety in a different way. \n\nIf compute were unlimited, I would agree with you that headlight cams are an obvious way to improve the design, but that is not reality. Every sensor added limits the framerate of all sensors and limiting framerate limits safety in high-speed scenarios.\n\nI'm not saying there is no way to deal with difficult turns like those in the video, but I don't believe sacrificing the B-Pillar or adding more cameras is the way forward. Driving strategy can compensate for a lot here (preemptively angling the vehicle while preparing to turn, route planning to prioritize simpler turns, etc...).\n\nBut as I eluded to in the beginning, one of the few things I would change in the system is a slightly wider FOV on the repeater cams for this exact scenario.
