{"title": "‚ÄúAdjusting‚Äù your basis is silly", "selftext": "We as traders hate losses. We mentally do whatever we can to avoid acknowledging them. A key example of this is when we sell premium against long shares (think covered calls, covered strangles, etc.) and apply a defunct accounting method, where we ‚Äúdecrease our basis‚Äù using the premium received. This doesn‚Äôt make sense and is done simply to assuage our egos.\n\nIn reality, the basis of your shares is whatever whatever it is. The options traded around the position are their own positions. The positions can part of a holistic strategy that we track the aggregate PnL of, which makes total sense. But mixing realized and unrealized PnLs to ‚Äúadjust‚Äù our basis confounds things. Moreover, in a less common scenario but worth mentioning, based on holding periods, realized and unrealized PnL have different tax implications. \n\nIf we have one share (simplicity for ease) at $10 sell a call for $1. Our basis is $10, not $9. \n\nIf the stock drops to $9 and our call expires OTM. We realize a $1 gain on our call and have an unrealized loss on our shares for $1. Net realized and unrealized is flat. If we choose to sell our shares, they will be sold at $10, not $9 for a -$1 loss. \n\nIf we have a position in AAPL that goes up and one in VLO that goes down, we don‚Äôt take the profits from AAPL and apply it to adjust our VLO basis. Even if it were placed as a (very strange) pairs trade, we simply account the PnL for each trade as it is, and monitor the aggregate. \n\nOvercoming this strong desire to hide from losses perpetuates the problem of loss aversion. Instead, we are far better off embracing reality as it is, learning that losses are part of the game and are okay.

That doesn‚Äôt mean your $100 in bank is $100 cash balance in records. \n\n\nAccrual is necessary for timing.
