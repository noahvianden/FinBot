It’s been one of the worst performers in the S&P 500 so far this year.\n\nLast year, Tesla sales were up 38% compared to 2022, but investors had expected more. Tesla warned in January that sales growth this year would be even slower.\n\nAs it turned out, sales haven’t grown at all in 2024.

Also, Tesla removed support for diversity and inclusion from its financial reports while X, as Musk renamed Twitter after buying it, re-instated the accounts of avowed racists.\n\nSurvey data from Caliber, a Denmark reputation management firm, indicates that Tesla’s reputation and customer purchase consideration for its vehicles fell sharply starting around the beginning 2022 — the year Musk took over the social media platform originally called Twitter — and have continued to decline since then. The data was first reported by Reuters.\n\nWhile Caliber’s data doesn’t make firm connections to specific causes, the company’s reseach also uncovered low opinions of Musk, himself. Musk and Tesla are, by far, much more closely connected in public perception than most CEOs and the companies they run, said Søren Holm, head of client services for Caliber.\n\n“He could, perhaps, not be more of a bright star at the top of Tesla than then he is. He’s a man of the year, he’s the richest person alive. Just heralded everywhere,” he said in an interview with CNN. “And then he’s using all of this otherwise positive attention to create some negative attention around himself.”\n\nTesla did not respond to a request for comment on the impact of Musk’s statements.\n\nBoth Musk and Tesla have low “trust and like” scores in Caliber’s analyses. Recent declines in “trust and like” scores for X, the social media platform for﻿merly known as Twitter before Musk bought it in 2022, suggests that the man in charge of both companies could have something do with their declining public regard.\n\nOpinions of Tesla dropped sharply starting in 2022 as Musk had openly railed against Covid-19 restrictions, but the decline has continued since then as Musk has made or supported public statements that were racist, anti-semitic or\n\n“He’s beginning to get this reputation of being a very kind of loose gun,” Holm said.\n\nAs competing models hit the market that are similar in price, quality and performance to those Tesla offers, the public image baggage Musk adds to the brand could dissuade shoppers, Holm said.\n\n“That’s something where the reputation a CEO imprints on a company’s brand and expression is carrying a lot of weight,” he said.", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "Those factors certainly aren’t helping. But Tesla’s problems can’t all be blamed on outside factors. Some of it is inevitable. New competitors have entered the market and, at some point, they had to start taking sales away from Tesla.\n\nAnd now they are.\n\nTesla made itself an easy target by failing to introduce new products fast enough to maintain customer interest. Also, its chief executive, Elon Musk, has become someone many people don’t want to associate themselves with, even for a good car.\n\nMeanwhile, overall electric vehicle sales in the United States have flattened out in recent months. EV sales growth has been slowing for a while but in the last two quarters, EV sales didn’t increase much at all, according to estimates from Cox Automotive.\n\nBut, upon closer inspection, what seems like widespread disinterest in electric vehicles may reflect, largely, less interest in Tesla.\n\nSome automakers, including Audi, BMW, Mercedes and Rivian, are reporting EV sales growth of more than 50% over the past year, noted Stephanie Valdez Streaty, an analyst with Cox Automotive, in a presentation summarizing industry trends in the new year. Ford later said its EV sales were up 86%.\n\n“Looking at the data, the big [EV] slowdown is shaping up to be a Tesla slowdown,” said Valdez Streaty.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I own a Tesla because it’s a great car and I bought when it had few EV competition.\n\nIf I was to buy today, I’d probably go with the KIA EV9.

Tsla may dip to 110, but for long term it is nothing less than a shadow of a dip. Your risk reward is at least 5r. Yes, I'm fully aware of the tension in Iran, and probably another melancholy earnings report but all these pullbacks are priced in.  One must simply zoom out and look at the bigger picture. It would be that of the utmost opportune time for tsla leaps. \n\nFear and greed, the greatest psychological aspects that keep 90 percent out of the game. Let me ask,  do you prefer purchasing a product at a discounted price or at market value? Fundamentally,  let's contemplate the future.  Do you believe gasoline vehicles will eventually become obsolete? Or, will tsla bots and ev's be that of a household societal norm?  I certainly think so.  Furthermore, I wanted to apprise you that California just banned the sale of gasoline vehicles by 2028.  Perhaps one may interpret such information as a foreshadowing of the new world, but I digress.\n\nAdditionally, tsla charging stations are being offered to other manufacturers.  In other words, Tsla just monopolized the entire ev industry. It is clear to see why Kathy Woods, along with Ark, have a heavily bullish sentiment on it.  Other tech stocks simply can not compete.  For example, Apple's dismal attempt at an ev was a catastrophic failure; the entire operation was forsakened to the depths, never to surface again.  Apple instead took the executive decision to focus on robots. Smart move.  It is solely that of existing car manufacturers that have the ability to compete with tsla, as you can evidently see by the handful of vehicles being churned out, such as Hummer, Bmw, Ford,  and GM to name a few.  These brands are merely preparing for what is immently coming, if not has already begun; an AI revolution.\n\nNow sir, who is the baffled one here? That is a rhetorical question.  The choice is yours, and you may do what thou wilt, for the dawn of a new era is on the horizon, and it will shine gloriously over our new world.
