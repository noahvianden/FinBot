Feel free to disagree. I am not trying to drive any narrative or conformity on the issue. more just sharing opinions. keep in mind this is not why nvidia or AMD are better at gaming/AI. just a comparison of why AMD is more competitive in AI than Gaming on a relative scale.\n\nSo AMD is selling about 400m of dGPUs per quarter. NVDA is at $2,800 worth. So NVDA is about 7x more than AMD there.\n\non AI it is more like 18000/900 = 20x. But i do think AMD as a growth percentage is going to advance faster than Nvidia. so their 20x should be reduced to 10x sometime in a yearish? maybe by Q1 2025 depending on how things play out.\n\nWhy is AI easier for AMD to make inroads? three reasons:\n\n(TLDR; AMD gaming GPU hardware is not as good as nvidias. Nvidia has PC OEMs on lockdown. AMD's AI hardware is very good. Nvidia doesn't have AI customers on lock down (particularly hyperscale customers))\n\n1. Hyperscalers do not want to be locked into cuda. They have a high amount of interest in alternatives. This is in stark contrast to gaming where gamers, OEMs, and developers tend towards Nvidia's dominance. Between mindshare, Nvidias software tools, and Nvidias ability to provide assistance to developers and OEMs AMD is almost shut out of gaming with the exception of Sony, Xbox, and DIY GPU sales. But those gaming markets are either very small (DIY) or very low margin (sony, xbox). So Nvidia reaps the bulk of all the profits. This is a pretty stark contrast to AI. Now . . . AMD's position is currently worse in AI than Gaming . . . For example their gaming drivers are typically very good and equal to nvidia. While Nvidia's CUDA and AI are far superior to AMD's software. But AMD is making very rapid strides.\n2. Nvidia cannot enforce GPP (geforce partner program) like practices at hyperscale customers and others like they can with OEMs. Not sure if  you are familiar with GPP but it is Nvidias program to provide support to OEM partners based on their level of dedication to nvidia products. AMD really doesn't have an answer to this and their business practice of just trying to be a really good partner to OEMs basically leaves them dead in the water with almost zero market share, and zero path to take more market share with the exception of DIY GPU sales.\n3. AMD's AI hardware is more competitive than their gaming GPU hardware (their gaming GPU hardware is particularly lacking in Power efficiency, ray tracing, die sizes are larger, and they have too much memory IMO- driving costs up). People might have issues with the software, but for inferencing AMD hardware is superior for the time being, and with software support will be superior. mi400 should solve a lot of the training issues as well. TBD. Even with blackwell it looks like nvidia will have an advantage in terms of server density. But AMD will be very competitive if they can find solutions to increase server density (TBD). I also don't think Nvidia has any interest to compete on price. They will be happy to let AMD take another 5% market share to maintain 80%+ margins.\n4. Demand for AI will drag AMD with it. This is not the case for gaming.\n\nThe one wild card for AMD is that Strix Halo looks quite good according to rumors. But . . . its a wild card that I'm not couting on. and i honestly think it will suffer due to GPP and AMD's lack of high dollar MDF for OEMs. probably only be 1 or 2 good laptops using it. maybe Asus G14 or G17 and probably and maybe some crappy HP or lenovo \"high end\" device that performs like crap.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "You just made a huge case for Guadi3 over MI300x.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "I dont think Gaudi3 will be better hardware than H100/200 or MI300x.

Those are 3 criterias that in depth have more complexities than it looks like... its not about making a powerfull chip in itself, its not just having good drivers for said chip... its about a good chip with a very good ecosystem that works in scale.

{"title": "Google lays off staff from Flutter, Dart and Python teams weeks before its developer conference", "selftext": "Ahead of Google’s annual I/O developer conference in May, the tech giant has laid off staff across key teams like Flutter, Dart, Python and others, according to reports from affected employees shared on social media. Google confirmed the layoffs to TechCrunch, but not the specific teams, roles or how many people were let go.\n\n“As we’ve said, we’re responsibly investing in our company’s biggest priorities and the significant opportunities ahead,” said Google spokesperson Alex García-Kummert. “To best position us for these opportunities, throughout the second half of 2023 and into 2024, a number of our teams made changes to become more efficient and work better, remove layers, and align their resources to their biggest product priorities. Through this, we’re simplifying our structures to give employees more opportunity to work on our most innovative and important advances and our biggest company priorities, while reducing bureaucracy and layers,” he added.\n\nThe company clarified that the layoffs were not company-wide but were reorgs that are part of the normal course of business. Affected employees will be able to apply for other open roles at Google, we’re told.\n\nIn one X post, a PM from Flutter and Dart said the layoffs had affected “a LOT of teams,” and that “lots of great projects lost people.”\n\n“We’re sad, but still cranking hard on I/O and beyond,” wrote Google PM Kevin Moore in the Flutter development community on Reddit, where he added that Flutter and Dart weren’t affected any more or less than other teams. “We know ya’ll care SO MUCH about the project and the team and the awesome ecosystem we’ve built together. You’re nervous. I get it. We get it. You’re betting on Flutter and Dart. So am I. So is Google,” he said.\n\nGoogle also told TechCrunch that Flutter will have new updates to share at I/O this year.\n\nIn a separate post on Reddit, another commenter noted the Python team affected by the layoffs were those who managed the internal Python runtimes and toolchains and worked with OSS Python. Included in this group were “multiple current and former core devs and steering council members,” they said.\n\nMeanwhile, others shared on Y Combinator’s Hacker News, where a Python team member detailed their specific duties on the technical front and noted that, for years, much of the work was done with fewer than 10 people. Another Hacker News commenter said their early years on the Python team were spent paying down internal technical debt accumulated from not having a strong Python strategy.\n\n“[D]espite the understaffing, we had managers who were extremely good about maintaining work/life balance and the ‘marathon, not sprint’ approach to work. As I said in another comment, it’s the best job I’ve ever had, and I’ll miss it deeply,” they wrote.\n\n“Python was one of the very first languages used widely at Google. It was the last major backend language to get a language team,” the user, gpshead, also said.\n\nThough Google didn’t detail headcount, some of the layoffs at Google may have been confirmed in a WARN notice filed on April 24. WARN, or the California Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, requires employers with more than 100 employees to provide 60-day notice in advance of layoffs. In the filing, Google said it was laying off a total of 50 employees across three locations in Sunnyvale.\n\nOn social media, commenters raised concerns with the Python layoffs in particular, given the role that Python tooling plays in AI. But others pointed out that Google didn’t eliminate its Python team; it replaced that team with another group based in Munich — at least according to Python Steering Council member Thomas Wouters in a post on Mastodon last Thursday.\n\n“It’s a tough day when everyone you work with directly, including your manager, is laid off — excuse me, ‘had their roles reduced,’ and you’re asked to onboard their replacements, people told to take those very same roles just in a different country who are not any happier about it,” he said.\n\nGoogle said it would support all affected employees, in line with local requirements, by providing them with time to search for different roles at Google or elsewhere, access to outplacement services and severance.\n\nSource: https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/29/google-lays-off-staff-from-flutter-dart-python-weeks-before-its-developer-conference/", "id": "1cgiwto", "created_utc": 1714447561.0, "score": 423, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 85, "comments": [{"body": "Google CEO’s MBA helping him in the only way they know how.
