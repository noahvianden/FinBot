Since today is the 3-month anniversary of the day I started, here is an update/story.\n\nIt started many months ago, Setptember to be exact, when I was selling cash secured puts on average stocks like META, MSFT, etc.. then everything changed in December when I decided to sell puts on AMC. AMC tanked and my puts got assigned, so I doubled down and it kept falling. Before I knew it, I was leveraged to the tits. Full send, max margin in AMC shares which you can see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/18wr5vz/the_first_and_probably_last_green_ytd_chart_i/) - a photo of my portfolio is in the comments. Unfortunately, AMC continued to go down.\n\nAround January 13th, I said fuck it. I sold EVERYTHING at a huge loss. I settled on keeping $58k and went full send into NFLX Put credit spreads barely out of the money. NFLX rose on earnings and the strategy was born.\n\nEventually, I did more research. I made the spreadsheet you see in my DD post and have since updated it further. Also, I almost exclusively sell deep otm call credit spreads now because I have found that they give me better risk to reward. Since January 13th, and Just to name a few, I've yeeted my whole net worth into selling OTM weekly Call Credit Spreads on NFLX, LULU, ULTA, COST, DG, MSTR, SMCI, BIDU, SOUN, DJT, and JPM. That's what I can remember right now at least.\n\nI haven't kept track of my total profit per week since I started, but here is the last 4 weeks (I know I'm missing some fees in my weekly ending amounts).\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zxo80m7tf5uc1.png?width=1345&format=png&auto=webp&s=fac9006b05bfbc5ecb25d0e7b4424b90f3d04f05\n\nThe $5700 I withdrew went towards this Rolex that I bought to celebrate.\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uy6nl7hvf5uc1.jpg?width=2251&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dd19d0fdf79eddd2d1a0e6e83639260002179654\n\nand yeah, Imma keep going.

I also prefer put credit spreads over call credit spreads because the premium is higher (people are willing to pay more for downside protection) and statistically stocks usually go up.

Then sell your short put outside of the band limits. The delta could be a lot higher (maybe 0.30) but chances are on your side.

Any and all regard advice appreciated :-)", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "Intel always has so much potential and seems to squander it in key areas.  \n\nOn the negative:\n- they previously sold their ARM-based mobile cpu business to Marvell and refocused on more profitable desktop and server business. ARM continues to eat INTC’s lunch in embedded, mobile, tablet, and now laptop/desktop (Apple M1/2/3 line). \n- Intel has done quite well with integrated graphics but always struggled to make discrete graphics cards. It was obvious with Project Larabee that Intel wasn’t committed to GPU architecture and tried to repurpose their existing architecture. It was a flop (not Teraflop). It turns out the massively parallel small cores of Nvidia and AMD GPUs is also great for AI and HPC.  Intel knows this yet keeps missing the boat\n- Intel long considered tablets as a novelty and focused on enabling the same old OEMs with laptop and desktop chips. MSFT recognized that consumers wanted better and more portable designs and the Surface and Surface Pro were honest attempts to shake this market up and keep Windows relevant.\n- The fab. Oh how the fab culture dominated Intel for years and they were so proud of it. The problem came in 10nm which is when Extreme UV (EUV) became necessary to reduce diffraction and thus improve yields.  Year after year they kept trying to fight physics. They needed EUV. \n\nOn the positive side:\n- intc is focusing on power design. Backside power delivery is awesome and saves as much as 30% of chip power. They were super good at transitioning mfg to this process improvement.  Kudos \n- breaking out the fab as a separate biz is key. They need each business to stop pretending that fab is free and the fab needs to stop hiding behind the super profitable server business. Fabs used to cost $5B, now they are $10B+. You need economy of scale and reusable design only possible by making chips for other customers.  This process is going to be painful but INTC needs to muscle thru it \n- silicon photonics continues to be a promising way of reducing DC power consumption and improving cross board data rates thru multi-wavelength data transmission. Promising but still probably too early for widespread adoption\n- chiplet design is the near future. the design of chips is hard and keeps getting harder and pre-silicon and post-silicon validation is getting exponentially more complex. The next logical step is to break the chips apart and stack them. You get to focus on each chip’s validation and reuse components across various designs. \n\nAnywho just my 2 cents.", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "Why didn’t you mention the Gaudi 3 AI chip that INTC just announced that outperforms NVDA and uses less power?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Great point.

I am curious to see how the Gaudi 3 performs vs the announced NVDA H200 and B200 chips.  AMD comes in way cheaper for their MI300 line ($10-15k) which is relatively competitive, so I imagine the Gaudi 3 will be priced somewhere in between (aka $15-30k).\n\nI also failed to mention other big INTC financial decisions like selling off the NAND business to SK Hynix (+$7-9B), spinning off Mobileye (+$861M raised), as well as buying Altera (-$16.7B) back in 2015.
