And while its volumes are still  small, Nikola is beating Tesla in the heavy truck market.\n\nThe Phoenix-based company said it delivered 40 Tre FCEV trucks in the  quarter and built 43 at its Arizona factory. Deliveries of the big  rigs, which retail for more than $500,000 each, rose from 35 in the  final quarter of 2023. CEO Steve Girsky said the company has also begun  shipping repaired battery-electric Tre trucks back to customers that  were recalled last year for problems with their lithium-ion packs.\n\nAside from beating an expectation of just 33 deliveries to customers  in the quarter, Baird equity analyst Ben Kallo said that Nikola’s  business is looking stronger. The company has struggled for years after  its disgraced founder Trevor Milton stepped down in 2020 after lying to  investors about the company’s technology (he was convicted of securities  fraud and [sentenced to four years in prison](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zacharyfolk/2023/12/18/nikola-founder-trevor-milton-gets-four-years-in-prison-for-lying-to-ev-startup-investors/?sh=73a3558b4172) and fined $1 million in 2023).\n\nA new CFO and the opening of Nikola’s branded HYLA hydrogen fuel  stations for trucks in California and Canada are also helping, Kallo  said in a research note. Plus, the company is poised to benefit from  tough new emissions rules for heavy-duty trucks [announced by the Environmental Protection Agency](https://www.epa.gov/regulations-emissions-vehicles-and-engines/final-rule-greenhouse-gas-emissions-standards-heavy-duty) last week.\n\n“The standards apply to model years 2027-2032 and will require (truck  manufacturers) to produce vehicles with increasingly carbon-neutral  technologies,” Kallo said in a research note. “Impacted vehicles include  delivery trucks, utility vehicles, transit buses, and semi-trucks. We  view this as a twofold benefit for NKLA as it will both accelerate  demand and indirectly benefit NKLA as charging/hydrogen fueling  infrastructure is built out.”\n\nUnder CEO Steve Girsky, a former vice chairman for General Motors and  long-time auto analyst, Nikola has tightened its business strategy to  building battery and hydrogen trucks and setting up fuel stations to  power them. Milton’s plans when he was still running the company— to  also become a major producer of green hydrogen, build electric pickup  trucks, military vehicles and watercraft — have all have been scrapped.\n\nNikola shares closed at 95 cents in Nasdaq trading Thursday, up 6.5%.  They’ve been below $1 for most of 2024 and are worth a fraction of  their $65.90 peak in June 2020, before Milton’s downfall.\n\nFor now, the company is focused on getting trucks to customers in California, where a state program provides a[ $240,000 rebate](https://californiahvip.org/vehicles/nikola-tre-fcev-fuel-cell-electric-truck/)  to fleet customers who buy the Tre FCEV. Last month, Nikola opened a  HYLA hydrogen station in Ontario, California, east of Los Angeles,  that’s initially designed to refuel 40 trucks a day.\n\n“We anticipate further sales growth in future quarters as our HYLA  hydrogen fueling solutions come online,” Girksy said in a statement.\n\nBut to survive long term, the company also has to reduce quarterly  losses and find sufficient funds to scale up the production of its  trucks. It lost $966 million last year and reported $465 million in  cash. The company didn’t announce when it would release first-quarter  financial results.\n\n### Beating Tesla Semi\n\nWhile its current sales volume is modest, delivering just 154  hydrogen and battery trucks since last year, Nikola appears to be far  outselling Tesla in the electric truck market.\n\nElon Musk said in late 2022, when the Tesla Semi presumably went into production, that deliveries would [ramp up throughout 2023 with a target of delivering 50,000 this year](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alanohnsman/2023/05/10/elon-musk-said-teslas-semi-would-transform-trucking-6-years-later-customers-are-still-waiting/?sh=27fe8bfa4128).  However, the company hasn’t shared any delivery figures for it since  then. The truck wasn’t referenced in first-quarter delivery figures  released this week, and Tesla also didn’t include Semi figures in its  quarterly financial filings last year. The model was listed as still  being in “pilot production” in Tesla’s annual report filed early this  year, with no details.\n\nNotably, the Tesla Semi also [isn’t registered among the trucks](https://californiahvip.org/vehicle-category/heavy-duty/)  qualifying for California’s clean truck rebates — the nation’s most  generous — suggesting it’s not being sold in the market where demand for  electric commercial vehicles is highest. So far, the only known users  of the Tesla Semi are Frito-Lay and Pepsi, which have about 100 trucks  hauling chips and soda in California.\n\nTesla didn’t respond to a request for details on how many Semis it’s  shipped so far and when it would register the truck for California  incentives.", "score": 34, "replies": []}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "I too stayed at a holiday inn express last night.", "score": 10, "replies": []}, {"body": "They require a battery 3x smaller than full electric trucks and have double the range.

This also means you'll pay at least 3 times as much for fuel/energy, since all the infrastructure is not free. Economies of scale will not be able to push hydrogen price below 3x renewable energy price.\n\nThe idea of only using electrolysis during peak supply times is interesting in theory, but it'll reduce the utilization of the hardware, which will just further increase final cost.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHydrogen will be important for some sectors, specifically where there is no way to effectively do the same thing with batteries/electricity, such as certain chemical processes.

But Hauling 26 tonnes vs 13~ tonnes is a massive loss.\n\nNow, I'm going to paint you a picture of how a logistics depot might use a few of their semis. The depot runs two trunks. One to the local hub (1h away) and another to the main hub (6h away). Respectively I'll refer to these two as local and premium.\n\nThe local trunk semi shunts trailers all night. It picks up a trailer, travels to the hub, gets loaded or picks up a pre-loaded trailer and then returns. The driver will take his breaks in the hub as he's being loaded. \n\nIn the morning, the shunter driver takes the keys from the local hub driver and then proceeds to shunt the trailers for the forklifts to load the rigid trucks for delivery that day. Rigids go out, delivery, return, get loaded again until all the freight from the local hub has been sent out for delivery or put in the warehouse.\n\nOnce the rigids have went home, the shunter for the backshift comes and takes the keys off the morning shunter. He then proceeds to shunt trailers to load outgoing freight. Then the local hub driver, having been to sleep and rested, returns and take the keys off the backshift driver to once again repeat the process of taking the trailers to the local hub and returning with freight.\n\n*THIS SEMI ALMOST NEVER TURNS OFF.* It also had over a million miles on its odometer.\n\nThe premium semi has two drivers so they can drive all night. They haul next-day deliveries to the main hub and return with next day deliveries for the depot. They drive non-stop so there's no delay. 13-14 hours total.\n\nSo, the question is, where can an EV semi find itself in this organisation? Where you can allocate the time for charging? How can you justify the decreased payload that may be critical for your premium deliveries?\n\nAnd how does the life-time of a battery compare to the life-time of a disel truck that has its service intervals up to millions of miles?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Also in terms of saving the environment the number to look at is emissions per ton transported a certain distance when it comes to hauling.  \n  \nSo an EV truck having half the payload really cuts into and probably eliminates the environmental benefits.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "My family had a truck business and my father actually was at the presentation of the first Mercedes EV truck since he remained in the main lobby group.\n\nPayload is the true problem, especially for mid to long range trucking - though a lot of use cases in Europe don’t use the full 40 tons anyway today. Still, the most sensible use cases involve more shorter range traffic below ~300km.\n\nBattery life-time is a big question though testing by Merc have show pretty good reliability in this regard. There will always be some degradation of course but if range is sufficient to start with that won’t matter too much. True range of an eActros 600 should be in the vicinity of 500 kilometers. Mercedes claims (reality will show if true) that after 1.2 million kilometers the test vehicles retained more than 80% of that. That would be pretty good actually.\n\nCharging times won’t matter if the drive rhythm can be sustained and charging during load times can be added. This seems to work pretty well with those already buying the eActros. Charging from 20 to 80% takes about 30 minutes. So you get 300km in 30 minutes.\n\nAn interesting bonus of the EV is the much smaller maintenance and repair it *should* be needing. Mercedes claims that the higher price (2.5x of a similar ICE Actros) would amortise after around 600.000km which is way beyond what modern heavy Semis usually make (more than double is standard).", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "It would honestly need a major reworking of how logistics works, in my opinion.\n\nYou need to collect next-day delivery freight from a hub that is 6 hours away and return before 8am (before the rigid drivers start leaving).\n\nLast collections are at 5pm and within an hour of the depot. This means the latest you can leave is 6pm. That gives you 14 hours to fit in 12 hours of driving, 1 hour of loading and an hour of downtime for the truck (fueling, toilet breaks, ect).\n\nWhich is why the semi is two-manned so they can swap as necessary to bypass the legal restrictions on maximum driving hours.\n\nThe stats you quoted basically state you need at least 1h30 of charging time which I'm assuming doesn't include the time it takes the truck to park and plug in.\n\nThe only solution would be to sub-contract to a company to run the freight to the depot. However, you would still need to send the trunk down with the collections.\n\nI know it's a difficult situation, but it's an example where an EV simply doesn't work. Or it actually doubles the amount of work being done before even considering payload.\n\nI also want to say but 30 minutes lost every 300km is a huge loss in time for a semi.
