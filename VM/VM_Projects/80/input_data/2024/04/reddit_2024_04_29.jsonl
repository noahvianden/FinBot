IBM has a large R&D effort over a number of years, first working on getting efficient quantum machine to work, which IBM has accomplished, and next designing and building out a commercialization if quantum, getting it to scale out efficiently. IBM was an early first mover in this quantum effort. And the company that can scale out quantum capabilities commercially will have a strong first mover advantage. As a Software Engineer, I've worked with semiconductor machines for decades and partnered with IBM consulting. I can say \"Quantum is the future\", so far beyond anything we are all used to.
