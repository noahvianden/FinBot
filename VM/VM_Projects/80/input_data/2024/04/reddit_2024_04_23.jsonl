{"title": "Spotify turns a profit as earnings and revenue beat estimstes", "selftext": "Spotify Technology (SPOT) reported fiscal first quarter earnings on Tuesday that beat expectations on both the top and bottom lines. The audio giant also swung to a profit as it continues to implement its recent \"efficiency\" strategy.\n\nOver the past year, Spotify has committed to multiple rounds of layoffs in addition to price increases and other initiatives to boost top-line growth and improve margins. The company said it will be more intentional about future investments after spending billions on its push into the crowded podcast market.\n\nThe audio giant reported operating income of 168 million euros ($179 million), compared with a loss of 156 million euros in the prior-year period. This was below company guidance of 180 million euros as social charges came in higher than expected, \"driven by share price appreciation during the quarter\", according to Spotify.\n\nIt also guided to a strong Q2 operating income of 250 million euros, well ahead of Wall Street consensus expectations. Revenue guidance for the second quarter also came in ahead of estimates — 3.8 billion euros versus the 3.76 billion euros that was expected.\n\nOn top of more deliberate spending, Spotify will reportedly once again raise prices after hiking the cost of certain subscription plans last summer.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, Spotify plans to raise prices by about $1 to $2 a month in five markets, including the UK, Australia, and Pakistan. The changes are expected to come at the end of April, with US prices to rise \"later this year.\" The report also said Spotify plans to introduce a cheaper option that does not include audiobooks.\n\nThe stock moved more than 9% higher in pre-market trading on Tuesday following the results.\n\nThe streaming service reported net income of 197 million euros ($210 million), or earnings of 0.97 euros per share. That was ahead of analyst expectations of earnings of 0.65 euros per share. It also compares with the year-earlier period loss of 225 million euros, or a loss of 1.16 euros a share.\n\nGross margins came in stronger than expected at 27.6%, beating company guidance of 26.4%. The streamer said it expects margins to tick up to 28.1% in the second quarter, primarily driven by year-over-year improvements in music and podcasting.\n\nSpotify has previously said it expects the metric to come in between 30% and 35% over the long term amid plans to further scale its podcasting and ads business.\n\nRevenue, meanwhile, totaled 3.64 billion euros ($3.88 billion) — 20% higher compared with the first quarter of 2023, and above Wall Street expectations of 3.61 billion euros.\n\nUser figures\n\nTotal monthly active users (MAUs) came in below company estimates of 618 million to hit 615 million in the quarter — but still a 19% improvement compared with the total in the year-ago period. The streaming service anticipates Q2 MAUs to come in at 631 million.\n\nPremium subscribers met Wall Street expectations of 239 million — a 14% year-over-year jump. Spotify expects that subscriber count to increase to 245 million in the second quarter.\n\nFree cash flow, another key metric for investors, came in at 207 million euros in the quarter compared to 57 million euros in the year-ago period.\n\nThe average revenue per user, or ARPU, for Premium subscriptions increased 7% to 4.55 euros (or 5% year over year, excluding foreign exchange headwinds.) ARPU was driven by price increase benefits that were partially offset by discounted plans and lower prices in emerging markets, the company said.\n\nProfit pledge\n\nOverall, analysts have been bullish on Spotify after the audio giant pledged to improve its profitability beginning in 2023 on a gross margin and operating income basis.\n\nSpotify stock has surged more than 100% over the past year and is up 43% year to date.\n\nSpotify spent $1 billion pushing into the podcast market over the past four years with splashy A-list deals and $400 million-plus studio acquisitions.\n\nThat spending took a significant bite out of gross margins and weighed heavily on profitability. In response, Spotify committed to several rounds of layoffs — three in 2023 alone.\n\nSpotify CFO Paul Vogel stepped down from his position on March 31. He will be replaced by Christian Luiga, previously at Swedish aerospace and defense company Saab. Luiga will take over in the third quarter, the company said.\n\nIn addition to layoffs and price increases, Spotify also changed up its royalty structure, made audiobooks free to paying subscribers, and locked in new deals with popular podcasters like Joe Rogan and Alexandra Cooper of \"Call Her Daddy.\"\n\nThe new deals come as Spotify further revamps its podcast strategy to focus more on distribution rather than exclusivity.\n\nThe audio giant announced that Rogan's podcast, its most popular on the platform, will be available on additional services like Apple Podcasts (AAPL), Amazon Music (AMZN), and YouTube (GOOGL) for the first time in years. Spotify will handle distribution and ad sales as it works to maximize revenue. Rogan will receive a guaranteed minimum rate and cut of the advertising revenue.\n\nCooper's \"Call Her Daddy\" deal will have a similar structure with the podcast now available on all major audio platforms after more than two years as a Spotify exclusive. The company will maintain the exclusive rights to the podcast's video portion.\n\nSource: https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/spotify-turns-a-profit-as-earnings-and-revenue-beat-estimates-102727402.html", "id": "1cb1vuq", "created_utc": 1713870699.0, "score": 669, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 85, "comments": [{"body": "These are some really positive quarterly results for Spotify.

Their early customer acquisition tactics (targeting college students like Facebook did to essentially maintain a lifelong customer base) and deals with the labels were genuinely innovative (the labels are actually financially incentized to see Spotify succeed because a SUBSTANTIAL % of their annual revenue comes from music streamed there, plus they own a small % of the company float). Plus they used to have unparalleled music discovery early on before all the other players decided to join in on the fun. I've literally discovered and became friends with an indie artist irl because of Spotify (went to one of his shows and me and my friends were literally the only ones there lol) \n\nUnlike all those other companies you mentioned, Spotify actually empowered the artists and the labels through improved discovery and distribution. Napster was literally legal piracy lol.

They don't care though because they're all flush with money from everything else they provide.

I will say though, people considering switching platforms is much more common in the US than overseas. It's so cheap everywhere else that even if they double subscription costs it would still be extremely affordable to everyone who has it in underdeveloped countries. That said, their user/subscriber has been growing healthily for years now. Every year I think, ok we're probably getting close to the peak of the acquisitions, they surprise me with another 20% annual user growth. They provide a very good all inclusive service for a very affordable price and apps nowadays are a lot more sticky than they used to be. Most people won't even consider going through the headache of switching platforms unless the costs get too high or there's a genuine unforgivable problem they have with Spotify's service specifically. \n\nI have Amazon prime already (have for years) and I don't even think about the possibility of canceling my spotify for Amazon Music.

The less time the price has to get better, the less the option contract is worth. \n\nStrike price - Your option has a strike price of $580. the Option is worthless if you hold til expiry unless it ends above $580 by your date. if you exercise the stock you can buy it at this price. \n\nbreakeven price - if you were to hold your option until your expiry date, then this is the price you need the stock to hit to make up for the premium\n\npremium - additional money you're being charged to own the contract. The person selling the contract pockets this. If you bought and immediately exercised a contract you would basically have paid the premium plus the price of 100 stocks \n\nexercise - this is when you convert your contract into the right to buy 100 shares at the strike price. Most of the time you don't want to do this because you can make more money selling the contract before expiry than exercising it. \n\ngamma - volatility - if the stock price is recent history has had wide jumps up and down, then it has high volatility. This makes it more likely that you'll reach the strike price or better, so when volatility is high, the contract is worth more, but if volatility is low, the contract is worth less. After events like earnings the volatility drops. \n\nSo now that those are defined. You should sell now because changes in volatility could reduce your profit, and as time increases, you'll lose money if the stock doesn't continue to gain value at a rate that outpaces theta. If you hold you risk losing your current gains for the prospect of getting more gains. If you sell you get the current gains and someone else buys that risk from you. \n\nIn a general sense it's fine to hold an option that's up profit if you do think it will continue rising, but you should understand the risk before you make a choice like that, because unlike stocks, with options you can easily lose the entire value.
