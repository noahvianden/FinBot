The vast majority of people can't charge an EV. It's a flex to have a Tesla because then people know you most likely own a million dollar+ home with a garage so you can protect your copper. For example, at my boss's new almost $3 million home he can't charge his Tesla so he had to sell it. He previously had a condo and had to fight 150 other units for the one charging space that their electrical service could handle. With Seattle outlawing gas appliance, they're going to lose that one space as the city forces people to switch to electric stoves and water heaters. They're looking at maybe a decade of pain before they can get the service to their building upgraded which is one reason he sold his unit. My condo building is saving to start that process in 2034. The building beside us applied for permission to upgrade in 2006, and they just finished about three weeks ago. Unfortunately, there's a major intersection between us so getting permission to shutdown a major road and intersection could take years.", "score": -1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Holding XOM since 2020.
