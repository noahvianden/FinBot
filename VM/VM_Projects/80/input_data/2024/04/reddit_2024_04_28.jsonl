You own a stock that sells for $100 per share and it pays a $1 dividend.\n\nThe stock suddenly drops 50% because of some black swan event. Your break even is $100 so you are down 50% on your initial investment.\n\nDespite the black swan event, the company raises the dividend to $1.10 per share. However, your shares are still down 50%.

You are collecting the same income on a stock that declined in value by 50% when it should be trading at $100 (fair value). You don’t have to touch your shares. You just collect the dividend to cover your expenses.\n\nIf dividends worked like stock prices, the dividend should have also declined by 50% to $0.50. Dividends don’t work like this though.

But, the one with dividend loses (50+d)%, where d is the dividend % as a fraction of share price. d gets progressively larger as the stock price decreases (example: stock with $100 share price and $10 dividend has d=0.10. If this stock halves, dividend is still $10 but stock price is $50 so d=0.20.)\n\nThis means that as the stock price decreases, the dividend in raw dollars might stay the same but the impact on the overall price gets materially larger!
