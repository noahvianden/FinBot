{"title": "Enovix corp (ENVX)", "selftext": "Energy materials scientist here. I researched batteries at NASA. Okay it was an internship but shaddap.  I'm a chemist who loves batteries and solar energy, and ~~gambles~~ dabbles in stonks like a goddamn idiot. Here's a hot take on Enovix Corp, a little company that thinks it could revolutionize the battery game. Strap in, degenerates.\n\n# TL;DR:\n\nEnovix Corporation (ENVX) is possibly maybe trust me bro shifting from underdog to top dog in the advanced battery sector. They are making next-gen silicon-anode lithium-ion batteries with major potential in high-demand markets like smartphones and EVs. Despite hemorrhaging cash like a thing that hemorrhages a lot of cash, they just hit a revenue spike in Q4 2023. Yet stonk price is close to their 52-week low, and their Q1 report is coming up soon, Setting up a moonshot or setting up for a spectacular crash? Fuck if I know.\n\n# Financials and stonk mommy moves:\n\n* **Cash burn vs. rocket fuel**: Enovix has been burning cash faster than you can say \"bankruptcy,\" with some negative EBITDA and net income that might scare off the faint-hearted. The net income has shown increasing losses, from about -$40 million in 2020 to -$214 million by end of 2023.\n* **Debt disaster**: The total debt significantly increased from virtually none in 2020 to $191 million in 2023. The debt is stacking up like a Jenga tower right before Ryan Gosling tells you to shut the fuck up.\n* **Revenue rollercoaster**: After a long period of couch change revenue, they jumped up to $7.4 million in Q4 2023, which could be the beginning of something bigger.\n* **Manufacturing muscle**: They’re expanding with a new high-volume manufacturing hub in Malaysia. It's supposed to be coming online this month.\n* **Strategic alliances**: They’ve got some hefty deals with top OEMs and a leading automaker *that shall remain nameless*, according to their most recent press release.\n\n# Tech specs and market hype:\n\n* **Battery breakthroughs**: They are producing batteries that have much higher capacity and longevity than what is currently on the market. At the same time, battery tech evolves at a breakneck pace, and competition is as brutal as Feyd-Rautha. Enovix needs to keep their edge sharp and scale efficiently without tripping over their own ambitions.\n* **AI Demand Surge**: With AI tech slurping up power like a person who slurps up a lot of stuff, there’s a growing need for batteries. Enovix is stepping up, ready to provide more stuff to be slurped by the person slurping stuff.\n\n# Bottom Line:\n\nEnovix is swinging for the fences with high-stakes tech innovation and strategic expansions. It’s a textbook high-risk, high-reward play. They could be the garden gnome that wins the Iron Throne that tech investors have been praying for to lead the next big wave in battery technology. Or, they could go down in flames as a cautionary tale of overreach and under-delivery.

Don't expect real revenue out of it for a while yet (probably end of the year or early 25).\n\nThe bump in revenue towards the end of last year is almost entirely from their acquisition of Korean cell manufacturer RouteJade.

Given that they recently also stood up an agility line (a line that is built for producing battery samples and not for high volume production) and that agility line passed FAT, now it just needs to go through SAT (site acceptance testing) for the line to be fully operational.
