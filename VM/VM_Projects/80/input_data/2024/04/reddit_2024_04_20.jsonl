As it should be, none of the parties can afford a war now and the countries separating them are not too keen on a new war, they have their own social problems they need to address. \n\nChina will be reluctant to attack Taiwan, until the US stays as a wildcard and might defend the island. China's economy depends on the exports to Europe and the US, a Russia-style sanction package could literally decimate its economic activity in the middle of their largest economic-demographic crisis in the last 50 years. I would pretty much doubt that they want to attack Taiwan nowadays. Most likely this has been discussed by their leaders that the US can not afford a Taiwan war until they rebuild their chip manufacturing capacity. \n\nCrash even more? The 5% pullback will widen into a 7% pullback? Or what can we expect? A 50% loss in the SP500 index? The problem with these predictions is the amount of decline that can be expected. The stock market has a momentum, after two weeks of red days, it is likely that some more decline will follow, before the trend reverses. But how much? Are we talking about a few percents? A halving? In the first case most investors do not have to do anything, just wait it out. In the second case some preparations would be wise, but how can we know that we are at that point?
