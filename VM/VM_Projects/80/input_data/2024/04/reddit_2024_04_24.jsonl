{"title": "Where NVDA trades in May", "selftext": "For those who followed my posts from Thursday/Friday of last week (April 18-19), I last left off explaining why NVDA would see a massive rally this week followed by a likely second leg lower.  \n\nI bought the NVDA $780-$800 call spread expiring this Friday — that’s how much conviction I had in the bounce — and also bought the NVDA June $770 calls.  I sold both calls for big gains and I’m no longer in NVDA.  I’m currently both long and short the NASDAQ-100. I bought calls last week and started buying puts yesterday and today.  Also, sold covered calls against my QQQ June calls.  I bought those calls last Friday near the lows of the session after exiting my remaining QQQ puts.  \n\nOkay.  So let’s rehash what happened this week and why.  \n\nOn Friday, the NASDAQ-100 hit a 20-RSI on the hourly, the $VIX reached overbought (70-RSI on daily chart) and the $NYMO reached extremely oversold levels (-100).  \n\nHere’s the truest statement I can say about the market.  There are periods of time when the market is very highly predictable.  Periods where anyone can forecast with a good 90% certainty what is likely to happen based on certain high win rate indicators and they’re not some secret indicators.  They’re among the most well established indicators. \n\nA 20-RSI on the daily for the S&P 500 or on the Dow or NASDAQ-100, for example, creates the most predictable market.  \n\nGo back 30-40 years and you’ll never see any of the indices reached a 20-RSI on the daily chart and then not have a massive rebound shortly afterward.  It doesn’t exist.  It is always the case.  Hit a 20-RSI on the QQQ daily, there isn’t a more sure long bet in the market.  \n\nThat’s because the market always rebounds big time under those circumstances.  That was true during the financial crisis, the COVID crash, the Dot-com crash.  Even the 1987 crash rebounded off of extremely oversold condition.  \n\nThis doesn’t work in the opposite direction mind you.  The markets aren’t remotely close to as predictable when they’re overbought as when they’re oversold.  In fact, overbought conditions are almost meaningless and have almost no predictive value.  \n\nThis is important to understand because what we had on Friday was a perfect set up for a bounce\n\nThis rebound from $750 to $840 was definitely going to happen.  Almost as certain as the sun rising.   \n\nNow far less predictable is where the oversold rebounds ends.  That’s a lot harder to predict and there is far less conviction there.  \n\nAgain, there are varying degrees of predictability in the stock markets. Anyone who does this and believes they can forecast market direction each and every day and under all conditions is kidding themselves.  \n\nThat being said, here’s what we do know and where things stand.  While the near-term is far less predictable than last Friday, we do have indicators suggesting what is most likely to happen from here.  \n\nNVDA tested its $840 resistance level today (support becomes resistance on breakdown) and has retreated back down to $800.   \n\nWhether NVDA will take another shot at $840, isn’t clear to me.  Especially with PCE numbers being released on Friday.  \n\nBut here’s what we can say about the next few weeks.  Take a look at this table in this post.  \n\nThis table contains the largest QQQ (NASDAQ-100) rallies going back to 2008.  \n\nHere’s why this table is important.  It shows that every single rally (except for the QE2 rally in 2010) has gone for at least a 10% correction immediately after peaking.  \n\nThe NADAQ-100 peaked at $449.40 and fell to a low of $413 last week.  That’s only 8% so far for the correction.   10% down takes it closer to $400.\n\nChances are the NASDAQ-100 is just rebounding ahead of a second leg lower.  \n\nLess predictable is when that leg will begin.  In most cases, the QQQ retraces half the losses before peaking and beginning its next leg lower.\n\nThat 50% retracement happened this morning.  The QQQ fell $36 from $449 to $413.  Half of that is $18.  The NASDAQ rallied about $17 up to around $430 high today.  So the NASDAQ 100 has already retraced half the losses.  \n\nNow does it have to be a 50% retracement.  No.  We’ve seen rebounds go to as high as 80% retracement.  That happened twice in the very last correction that ended November 2023.   We had three legs down in that correction and two of the legs retraced 80% of the losses.  \n\nSo we could see the QQQ go a lot higher before beginning it’s next leg down.   But I don’t think it will get much higher than 436 to 437.  There is heavy resistance at that area.  \n\nPersonally, I started buying QQQ July $390 puts, sold the April 26 $427 calls short against my June $410 calls and sold my NVDA.  If we go north of $430 on the QQQ, I’ll go full short again.    \n\nNow here’s how this all applies to NVDA.   NVDA is connected to the QQQ.  Being the third largest holding in the QQQ, if the market sells off, so does NVDA.  \n\nSo as it stands right now, my expectation is the QQQ is likely to drop to the low $400’s or high $390’s before bottoming out.  \n\nHow much NVDA drops on that leg down is harder to forecast.  $710 is the center of gravity for this correction.   The closer it gets to 710 the more heavy the buying is going to be in Nvidia.  There’s no way to forecast how low Nvidia is going to go exactly.  But it will be heavily bought anywhere in the mid 700’s and it is extremely unlikely to fall under 700.   And that has more to do with fundamentals than it does technicals.  \n\nAnd as I’ve already mentioned before, the moment the NASDAQ 100 falls to the low 400s I’m going long both the QQQ and NVDA. \n\nNow the biggest risk to the entire thesis is the NASDAQ-100 doesn’t fall 10% as it has in every other 17%+ rally.  \n\nThe QE2 rally that happened in 2010 occurred off of a massive summer crash of 20% and on the back of Ben Bernanke announcing QE2 to help continue shoring up the market after the financial crisis.  \n\nWhen QE1 ended, the market had a flash crash and a massive summer bear market.  The fed was worried that removing QE would lead to a double dip depression.  So that environment was heavily inflationary for the stock market.  Still, the NASDAQ-100 didn’t drop 10% on that correction.   That is the lone example.\n\nThus, overall the most likely scenario is for 10% drop in the QQQ.  In a sample of 12 explosive rallies, all but 1 lead to right into a 10% correction.\n\nThat being said, as I mentioned earlier the next few weeks are less predictable than when the markets were oversold last week, but there is still probative value in the historic analysis of past corrections.  There’s a fair probability we see more downside based on what we know of past corrections.  \n\nWe know that corrections are generally multi legged.  we know that the NASDAQ 100 rallied 31% straight making this the third largest rally in 16 years.  We know that the last correction only went for 11%.  The market is up more than 80% from the lows.  And in that time we’ve had a single 11% correction.  In the past the larger, the rally the bigger the correction.  We’ve had two back-to-back 30% rallies now and one 11% drop and another 8% drop.  Chances are we have a lot more downside ahead.  \n", "id": "1cc50d6", "created_utc": 1713981683.0, "score": 111, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 137, "comments": [{"body": "Appreciate your analysis/ info.

The whole thing can get derailed by consistently strong earnings reports and good inflation numbers.  \n\nThough I think what that is likely to do is just stall the inevitable.  \n\nThe stock market spent a lot of time trading in and around the 440s.  \n\nNot enough time has elapsed for the QQQ to be able to just get right through that resistance.  \n\nUsually corrections create a big gap in both time and price.  That’s what allows the next leg to go right through key resistance levels.  \n\nBut if we don’t have a large enough of a correction then what will happen is the QQQ will just get back up to 440s and then just go down again.  \n\nThat exactly what we see  happen in those 80% retracements.  \n\nLast summer was a perfect example of this.  The QQQ peaked at $388 in July 2023.  It then fell to a low of $354 — falling $34 — before rebounding all the way back up to $382.  It almost fully recovered.  It then fell $32 down to $350 before rallying all the way up to $376 — almost fully recovering again — before then falling a third time down to a low of $341. \n\nThe QQQ ultimately fell 10%.  But the market tried twice to rally early and failed.  \n\nThose were legit rally attempt to end the correction.  And everyone in the market was to believe that it was over each time.\n\nSo I think that is what is most likely to happen if earnings comes in and derails the selling.

Point is, people thought Super Micro was showing weakness and since Nvidia hardware fits into Super Micro hardware, they extrapolated.\n\nAnd now we're seeing the big dogs bracing their investors for all the money they're going to spend on AI compute. The Super Micro panic was bullshit and the perfect opportunity to buy.\n\nWe'll see when Super Micro does their REAL earnings on April 30th. My prediction is that they will kill it and Nvidia will surge yet again, because here's the thing: Nvidia WILL crush their earnings, just like they have the last 4 times.

I sold both calls for big gains and I’m no longer in NVDA.  I’m currently both long and short the NASDAQ-100. I bought calls last week and started buying puts yesterday and today.  Also, sold covered calls against my QQQ June calls.  I bought those calls last Friday near the lows of the session after exiting my remaining QQQ puts.  \n\nOkay.  So let’s rehash what happened this week and why.  \n\nOn Friday, the NASDAQ-100 hit a 20-RSI on the hourly, the $VIX reached overbought (70-RSI on daily chart) and the $NYMO reached extremely oversold levels (-100).  \n\nHere’s the truest statement I can say about the market.  There are periods of time when the market is very highly predictable.  Periods where anyone can forecast with a good 90% certainty what is likely to happen based on certain high win rate indicators and they’re not some secret indicators.  They’re among the most well established indicators. \n\nA 20-RSI on the daily for the S&P 500 or on the Dow or NASDAQ-100, for example, creates the most predictable market.  \n\nGo back 30-40 years and you’ll never see any of the indices reached a 20-RSI on the daily chart and then not have a massive rebound shortly afterward.  It doesn’t exist.  It is always the case.  Hit a 20-RSI on the QQQ daily, there isn’t a more sure long bet in the market.  \n\nThat’s because the market always rebounds big time under those circumstances.  That was true during the financial crisis, the COVID crash, the Dot-com crash.  Even the 1987 crash rebounded off of extremely oversold condition.  \n\nThis doesn’t work in the opposite direction mind you.  The markets aren’t remotely close to as predictable when they’re overbought as when they’re oversold.  In fact, overbought conditions are almost meaningless and have almost no predictive value.  \n\nThis is important to understand because what we had on Friday was a perfect set up for a bounce\n\nThis rebound from $750 to $840 was definitely going to happen.  Almost as certain as the sun rising.   \n\nNow far less predictable is where the oversold rebounds ends.  That’s a lot harder to predict and there is far less conviction there.  \n\nAgain, there are varying degrees of predictability in the stock markets. Anyone who does this and believes they can forecast market direction each and every day and under all conditions is kidding themselves.  \n\nThat being said, here’s what we do know and where things stand.  While the near-term is far less predictable than last Friday, we do have indicators suggesting what is most likely to happen from here.  \n\nNVDA tested its $840 resistance level today (support becomes resistance on breakdown) and has retreated back down to $800.   \n\nWhether NVDA will take another shot at $840, isn’t clear to me.  Especially with PCE numbers being released on Friday.  \n\nBut here’s what we can say about the next few weeks.  Take a look at this table in this post.  \n\nThis table contains the largest QQQ (NASDAQ-100) rallies going back to 2008.  \n\nHere’s why this table is important.  It shows that every single rally (except for the QE2 rally in 2010) has gone for at least a 10% correction immediately after peaking.  \n\nThe NADAQ-100 peaked at $449.40 and fell to a low of $413 last week.  That’s only 8% so far for the correction.   10% down takes it closer to $400.\n\nChances are the NASDAQ-100 is just rebounding ahead of a second leg lower.  \n\nLess predictable is when that leg will begin.  In most cases, the QQQ retraces half the losses before peaking and beginning its next leg lower.\n\nThat 50% retracement happened this morning.  The QQQ fell $36 from $449 to $413.  Half of that is $18.  The NASDAQ rallied about $17 up to around $430 high today.  So the NASDAQ 100 has already retraced half the losses.  \n\nNow does it have to be a 50% retracement.  No.  We’ve seen rebounds go to as high as 80% retracement.  That happened twice in the very last correction that ended November 2023.   We had three legs down in that correction and two of the legs retraced 80% of the losses.  \n\nSo we could see the QQQ go a lot higher before beginning it’s next leg down.   But I don’t think it will get much higher than 436 to 437.  There is heavy resistance at that area.  \n\nPersonally, I started buying QQQ July $390 puts, sold the April 26 $427 calls short against my June $410 calls and sold my NVDA.  If we go north of $430 on the QQQ, I’ll go full short again.    \n\nNow here’s how this all applies to NVDA.   NVDA is connected to the QQQ.  Being the third largest holding in the QQQ, if the market sells off, so does NVDA.  \n\nSo as it stands right now, my expectation is the QQQ is likely to drop to the low $400’s or high $390’s before bottoming out.  \n\nHow much NVDA drops on that leg down is harder to forecast.  $710 is the center of gravity for this correction.   The closer it gets to 710 the more heavy the buying is going to be in Nvidia.  There’s no way to forecast how low Nvidia is going to go exactly.  But it will be heavily bought anywhere in the mid 700’s and it is extremely unlikely to fall under 700.   And that has more to do with fundamentals than it does technicals.  \n\nAnd as I’ve already mentioned before, the moment the NASDAQ 100 falls to the low 400s I’m going long both the QQQ and NVDA. \n\nNow the biggest risk to the entire thesis is the NASDAQ-100 doesn’t fall 10% as it has in every other 17%+ rally.  \n\nThe QE2 rally that happened in 2010 occurred off of a massive summer crash of 20% and on the back of Ben Bernanke announcing QE2 to help continue shoring up the market after the financial crisis.  \n\nWhen QE1 ended, the market had a flash crash and a massive summer bear market.  The fed was worried that removing QE would lead to a double dip depression.  So that environment was heavily inflationary for the stock market.  Still, the NASDAQ-100 didn’t drop 10% on that correction.   That is the lone example.\n\nThus, overall the most likely scenario is for 10% drop in the QQQ.  In a sample of 12 explosive rallies, all but 1 lead to right into a 10% correction.\n\nThat being said, as I mentioned earlier the next few weeks are less predictable than when the markets were oversold last week, but there is still probative value in the historic analysis of past corrections.  There’s a fair probability we see more downside based on what we know of past corrections.  \n\nWe know that corrections are generally multi legged.  we know that the NASDAQ 100 rallied 31% straight making this the third largest rally in 16 years.  We know that the last correction only went for 11%.  The market is up more than 80% from the lows.  And in that time we’ve had a single 11% correction.  In the past the larger, the rally the bigger the correction.  We’ve had two back-to-back 30% rallies now and one 11% drop and another 8% drop.  Chances are we have a lot more downside ahead.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Can you tell me why it is unlikely to fall under 700 for fundamental reasons?

{"title": "I've driven 5-hrs straight almost twice a week for the past few months with FSD. I see the value very differently.", "selftext": "On every one of those drives it would have driven me into a ditch at 75mph \"at least once\" and it often did so multiple times within the span of a few minutes. This issue has existed for about a year and is still present (at least on the version I currently have as of a week ago).\n\nEven if that issue gets solved it shows how long glaring issues can last, how deadly they can be, and potentially how often they can occur. Even if every 5 hours is particularly frequent compared to others, it still needs to get MUCH better and/or more restricted before Tesla will even think about taking liability of something like robotaxi. They need to get the time-between crashes to something like a year if they want to break even on the cost of repairing the vehicles when they crash (let alone payouts to other parties involved in the crash or injury/deaths of riders). And as edge cases become less frequent, there will be less data of those edge cases to train against. So it WILL get harder and harder to get rid of those edge cases. I don't see FULL Full Self Driving being solved anytime soon even at this recent rate of improvement. The absolute soonest I can see it happening is 2 years from now, but I'm thinking more about a decade if Tesla doesn't abandon it.\n\nIf they actually want to do robotaxi soon (which I am not sure how they can do without steer-by-wire which is hardware that is EXTREMELY important for robotaxies) then they'll need to restrict when & where it's used, likely to densly populated cities where there are enough people and enough potential revenue to realize the majority of the profit they can achieve. Also keep in mind that though they have more driving and training data, they have a NN as a generalized solution whereas a company like Waymo has been going after a very specific area/situation. Its not very clear how well FSD would compare to Waymo when compared apples to apples. Also the NN may be slower to improve for a situation like city driving only (great for tackling general driving, but directly writing code may be faster if you have a much smaller set of situations).\n\nIt's also important to realize that there just won't be a scenario where people don't own their cars anymore and Tesla takes in profits by having everyone use robotaxi instead. Most people's driving is done on their commute to & from work, which is mostly in the morning and afternoon. So the idea that cars will not sit idle will not apply. Not letting cars sit idle isn't a new concept because that is exactly what taxi services do, they run their vehicles full time. So either Tesla wastes the majority of \"car-hours\" by building out a fleet large enough to get everyone to & from work and let the vast majority of the fleet sit idle until those times, or they do achieve near 100% utilization of \"car-hours\" by only building out a fleet large enough to displace Uber/Lyft with the baseline need for a rideshare/taxi service.\n\nSo the absolute best case scenario is Tesla offers steer-by-wire retrofits in select cities in order to launch a limited robotaxi service to absorb market share from Uber/Lyft/Waymo. This also assumes that the system is good enough for city driving that it won't cost Tesla more for repairs and lawsuits then they can pull in. It's possible that this means they could get more driving data faster to assist their general FSD goal, but I'm not very optimistic at how efficient that will be or how much of a market there would be left for that much additional driving.\n\nUpdate: Accurate as of FSD 12.3.4.

I myself, took a beating betting against the Musktards, but prefer McDonalds... just a question of taste tbh.\n\n..but this post is slightly different.\n\n1. 10y yields broke 4,50, yet we moved the pain bar to 4,75...
