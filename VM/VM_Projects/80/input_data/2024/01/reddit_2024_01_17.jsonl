{"title": "Finally sold PLUG", "selftext": "I defeated my denial and sold PLUG today. Was I stupid to buy it in the first place? Probably. The gamble did almost pay off though. My first purchase was 3-3.5 years back when it was $14 and I kept on buying till it was $30. PLUG breached $75 and guess what, I never sold it. I went \"long\". Today, as I sold over 1000 shares accumulated over these years at 2.95$, I'm realizing the importance of reading annual and earnings reports. It was always going to end up a penny stock and it's not even a benefit of hindsight. The stock never deserved to go beyond a buck. \n\nJust an advice to all the bag holders out there. Don't let emotions and news interfere with business numbers. Fundamentals will always trump everything. I'm glad my Apple and Microsoft are 50-80% up but well, PLUG will remain my life lesson on doing due diligences, not getting caught up in meme stocks, always setting a stop limit sell price, and um not being stupid in general\n\nPeace out.\n\nEdit: I bought quite a bit at 3-6$ range too so it's not as bad as it sounds. But still, pretty bad.

Your parents telling you not to touch it or you touching it and getting burned. Sometimes the hardest lessons are often the best cause we tend to learn the most from it which looks like you recognize. Good on you for moving on.\n\nI remember arguing with people about this stock way way back. It was a popular Reddit stock in 2021. Anybody who is capable of reading a financial statement can see the company was garbage and only exists as a pump and dump. Keep the executives rich while the investors got stuck holding the bag. However when it came to this company people were only interested in the story. This is a prime example of a stock with a story and without the fundamentals is just a fairy tale and thats all this company was.", "score": 94, "replies": [{"body": "True. My first hint should've ATLEAST been when they said their accounting was wrong. And they've never made a profit. Yeah these were huge red flags and I believed a \"story\" peddled by paid media outlets.", "score": 22, "replies": [{"body": "For me it actually wasn’t the income that made me see how fundamentally broken the company was. Don’t get me wrong their income is atrocious and the accounting foolery was definitely up there too. However there were 2 main red flags I saw even before all of these issues.\n\nThe first major red flag I saw was their revenue. Their cost of revenue is actually higher than their actual revenue. Meaning their gross profit is negative. We don’t even have to talk about them being profitable at that point when they’re not even making revenue at all. \n\nThe other was their stock based compensation with share dilution. Their stock based comp and share dilution has got to be the biggest I have ever seen a company do. From 2019 to 2022 their shares outstanding went from 237 million to 580 million. In just 3 years they more then doubled their shares. Stock based comp went from 11 million in 2019 to 179 million in 2022. \n\nSo here is what I saw. You have a company that has a nonfunctional business model that can’t pull in revenue all the while the executives are issuing shares like there is no tomorrow. They’re skyrocketing their stock based compensation to keep up with the dilution so they can stay rich and the leave the investor holding the bag. They keep investors buying the stock by putting up pretty powerpoint presentations on how their hydrogen forklifts are going to change the world. This is literally a classic pump and dump and the stock should theoretically be worth zero. Its been going on for 20 years and this business model only exists for one reason. Its not to make money or make the investors rich but to keep the executive’s rich and the investors poor.\n\nI normally don’t like giving investment advice at all but this one I definitely think you made the right choice by getting out of this. Some loss is better than losing it all which is what I think what would have happened. Especially since the 2021 stock mania is over and people are starting to wake up and actually look under the hood of these companies.

The remaining 20% is for short term trading (ie: weeks to months). So even if you make a dismay 3% gain from $80, you can easily cover the 10% loss from $20 ($2.40 - $2 = $0.40 profit).\n\nNote: the 80/20 rule is called the Pareto Principle, in stock trading it means 80% of your profit (or loss) comes from 20% of your stocks.
