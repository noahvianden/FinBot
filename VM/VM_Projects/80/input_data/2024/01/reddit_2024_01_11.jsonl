{"title": "A Case Against the NVDA AI Bubble Theory", "selftext": "Tons of bears in this sub pushing the idea that we're going to have a massive AI bubble pop on a similar level to the dot com bubble and they don't know what they're talking about. Just my two cents coming from a degree in computer engineering, not a psychic but am highly regarded by my wife's boyfriend.\n\nYes there are a ton of AI startups that will all buy NVDA hardware then do nothing worthwhile and crash and burn just like a ton of new internet companies during the dot com bubble let's just pretend for a second thats the same thing even though it's not.\n\nIn this scenario NVDA is basically 90s Cisco. An internet backbone company that exploded in market cap then never really recovered after the dot com crash. This is real wrong. The hardware and infrastructure Cisco was doing at the time was ahead of the game but it wasn't stuff that other companies couldn't also do with enough time, money, and manpower.\n\nThe complexity of internet backbone tech is nothing in comparison to GPU architecture. Internet tech scaling is just all about finding ways to push more data around the world faster and more securely. Websites don't really get much better over time they just look visually more appealing and load faster. GPU tech scaling is running increasingly more intelligent AI, mining crypto that becomes infinitely harder to mine over time and thus requires more and faster GPUs, and powering graphical software that only increases in complexity every year with movies and video games and VR and whatever other new graphical tech the world comes up with holograms or some shit idk.\n\nThe world has a very finite number of highly skilled hardware engineers. Universities shit out the IT and CS guys who work in internet related companies by the truckload. It is so much less complex to design a website or a database or a router or even some big giant server cluster or a cell tower or whatever software thing than what goes into designing and producing a new family of GPUs.\n\nThe best companies to invest in are hard to imitate and can just keep designing new products and improving on old ones for as far into the future as you can imagine that's how green line go up and that's exactly what a company like NVDA is.\n\nTLDR: fuck your NVDA puts, fuck your NVDA bubble, eat my ass, eat my wife's boyfriend's ass, and have a good day.", "id": "193xakf", "created_utc": 1704963549.0, "score": 93, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 85, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|just now\n**Total Comments**|0|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|10 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Most people are not bears,they just wish it to crash so they can get on cheaper,which is another way to demonstrate their shit brain cuz nvidia gonna moon anyway", "score": 31, "replies": [{"body": "It’s not “going to moon” lol, it already mooned.
