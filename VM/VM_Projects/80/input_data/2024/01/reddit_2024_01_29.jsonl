In their words, that is what they do better than any other company. So, in a sense, if Netflix had Disney's catalog, they would do a better job of \"serving\" each user the best possible combination of shows for that specific user than Disney currently does.\n\nIf you think about it, they have been doing this for way longer than any other company, because they started \"predicting\" which DVD you would love based on your previous selections. They later incorporated this to their algorithm when they began streaming, and it was the basis for their content creation. Disney and others, on the contrary, were making movies and show on the old mediums (Movie theaters and TV channels), and didn't benefit from the direct and individual feedback like Netflix did. Netflix now makes the content they predict their users would love the most, because they are great at predicting precisely that.. This is how you get the massively successful oddballs, like Stranger Things, Wednesday, The Squid Game, and a cacophony of other highly specific shows in wildly different genres, each of which would have never seen the light in other companies. \n\nAlso, because they began first, they capitalized on their huge user base, and they are now the fastest producers of content in the world, premiering around 1 new show/movie per day, as opposed to Disney with 1 per week, and others ranging from 1 per 2 weeks to 1 per month. Keeping this schedule is incredibly expensive and can only be justified if your user base is massive (as Netflix's is). So you need the massive amount of users to be able to make profitable content, but you need lots of content to attract lots of users.

It wasn’t cut off from resources but it wasn’t given anything extra during the lame duck period. Despite history length similar to Netflix, it was a fragmented ownership making it not a huge original programming and instead a bunch of stuff from cable. Thisnimpacts business practices as well as production scaling which Netflix mastered. They also focused on Live TV which Netflix ignored. \n\nDisney+: \nClean app, but nothing changed since launch which needs to upgraded in so many areas. Biggest focus has been reaching a certain number of subscribers and profitability. Dual mandate creates a lot of issues that hurt consumer. Covid hurt company which changes mindset of profitability. Living in a dual world between legacy and modern which is tough to straddle and hurt in various ways. Further compounded by much content falling below expectations. Focus was heavily on kids, but also their core competency so it’s natural. Fox purchase and Hulu ownership allows them to continue adding adult stuff which they have been doing. \n\nESPN: \nSuffering from cable cuts and increasing costs. Also limitations between ESPN and ESPN+. The tech and interface behind them is terrible and unchanged for a decade. Covid. I don’t expect much to change until Disney finalized decision of selling off or overhauling business practices and stuff. \n\nThe future:\nDisney and Hulu are expected to be profitable by end of year. This will allow for better stuff in future. DIS righted the ship as a business in operating and financial ways last year so expect the benefits to play out the next 2 years. Better tech, content and operations is expected to be the focus over the next year which will bear fruit over time. Will continue merging platforms or content. Will have much better flexibility to sell content to other providers driving up profit more. \n\nNetflix:\nMastered scaled production of content. First mover advantage. Best tech. No others ancillary business or legacy practices to distract. Operated at losses much longer than competitors but gained the key market share. Since covid, production has been lumpy and not a steady stream of content. Past year has been a bigger focus on third party content rather than their own. Shifted focus to more profitability as market matured. \n\nRest of players:\nParamounts going to end up merging with WBD. This new platform is on par with Netflix and Disney which means it’s enough good content to warrant subscribing and have a mix of use rather than heavily Netflix.
