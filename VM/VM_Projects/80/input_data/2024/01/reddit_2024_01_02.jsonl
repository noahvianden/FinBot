You sold SPY at 426 and bought SVXY at 80.\n\nOn 11/3, VIX dropped to 15, you sold SXVY at 88.58 and bought SPY 434.69.\n\nSVXY rose over 10% in this time compared to SPY gain of 2%. \n\nThis is what I am thinking of doing. If VIX kept on going, you would buy more SVXY at your predetermined levels without going into margin as your unrealized losses will be much higher than if you just kept SPY. So, the drawdowns will be far greater than SPY if VIX keeps on rising and you keep your schedule.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Love it", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "We do not know how high VIX will go next time.
