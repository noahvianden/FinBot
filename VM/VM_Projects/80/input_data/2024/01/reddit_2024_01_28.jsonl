Can other streamers replicate that as a driver for growth?", "selftext": "   ***At 572, Netflix is up 100 points YTD; up 200 points ttm;*** *with sub gains being cited as the major lift for the stock; having added 13mil subs during their latest quarter. Netflix claims password sharing crackdown's staggered application among countries is expected to drive growth for several years. As far as I know only* ***Disney has adopted the policy so far***; *having started in Canada in November*. \n\n   *At first I thought it was unique to Netflix cause it's so old and we know most of the freeloaders are in one family unit that grew apart, but then I came across this study that suggested otherwise. At a time when the domestic market is saturating with 85% of households using streaming (HarrisX),* ***this is very relevant to the stock growth story.***\n\n***The survey, conducted by Secure Data Recovery***, *a digital forensics service, asked 2,000 U.S. consumers about their password-sharing habits and which platforms they weren’t willing to pay for. One in three respondents said they share a password with a partner, while one in four share with friends. The survey shows 80% of the U.S. doesn’t consider it a form of stealing, and 69% reported using someone else’s password*.\n\n***Key Takeaways:***\n\n\\****California, Ohio, and Florida*** *residents are most likely to share passwords.*\n\n\\****69%*** *of Americans have used someone else's login for a streaming service in the past.*\n\n\\****80%*** *of Americans don't view it as a form of stealing.*\n\n\\****Netflix, Disney+, Hulu and Max*** *(formerly HBO) are the most common platforms for password sharing.*\n\n***24.8% of Netflix*** *users reported borrowing a password, ahead of* ***19.1% of Disney+*** *members,* ***17.5% of Max*** *members,* ***17.2% of Hulu*** *subscribers, and* ***14.6% of Prime*** *Video users.* ***Paramount+ 11%****, followed by* ***Peacock with 9.1%****,* ***Apple TV+ with 5.4%****, Y****ouTube TV with 4.7%****, and* ***Sling TV with 1.6%****. A majority of Americans are sharing logins with their family, but they are not the only people logging in for free. When it comes to sharing passwords, 1 in 3 people share with their partner, while 1 in 4 share with friends.*\n\n*Some Americans only watch certain streaming services due to the free access, however. If a password crackdown took place across all services, viewers say they would be most likely to give up Netflix, Hulu, and Disney+ for good\\*. Perhaps this means those who were password sharing for Netflix and Disney+ have already said their goodbyes following the restrictions put in place.*\n\n***............End of Article............***\n\n***Study available for free:*** [*https://www.securedatarecovery.com/blog/password-sharing-by-state*](https://www.securedatarecovery.com/blog/password-sharing-by-state)", "id": "1ad6vdf", "created_utc": 1706460387.0, "score": 159, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 89, "comments": [{"body": "Yes it can be replicated. \n\nThat said Netflix has the most content throughput and lowest churn … if other services replicate it is likely their churn will increase and not have the same growth as what Netflix experienced.\n\nIf other services get better with their content release cadence to retain subscribers then, yes, I could see the password crackdown coming for them as well.", "score": 111, "replies": [{"body": "I don't know if other platforms would have the same success.

Netflix is in a stage of being constantly one negative news cycle away from death. If other streaming services try to replicate than they'll be in a similar situation, but Netflix has the advantage of being first and having the brand name recognition.

Now if you watch a streaming service in a browser window, you don't even get 1080p.

Gabe Newall, the CEO of Valve and the Master of counting to 2 once said \"Piracy is not an issue of price, it's an issue of service.\" If streaming services can't even provide basic 1080p expected service, people will flock to piracy. It's only a matter of time until credit cards expire and the new pirates decide it's not worth the effort of entering their new card information. Piracy is the easiest it's even been, a good VPN can be found for $80 for 3 years during the right sale, a few media management softwares, and Jellyfin is all you need.
