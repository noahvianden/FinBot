But you can do this with financial securities, and the above principle holds.\n\nForget about options for a minute.  Let's say you buy 100 shares of a stock at $10 per share.  This costs you $1000, right?  Then let's say over the next few days, the stock goes up to $11.53 per share.  Your brokerage platform would display an unrealized gain of $153.  Why is this?  Well, because if you sold your shares, you'd receive $1153.  You paid $1000 to buy them, so the difference, 1153 - 1000 = 153, is your profit.\n\nIt's the same with short-selling a financial security, like you did with those SBUX call options.  The reason it says the value of your position has increased by $153.35 is not that you are going to receive an *additional* $153.35 in cash for closing your position.  You have to *pay* cash to close your position.  But currently, you'd have to pay less cash than the $773.35 you received when you opened your position.  How much less? $153.35.  This is because the current premium of the call option is 153.35 / 100 / 10 = about 0.15 less than when you sold.  (I can't look up up-to-date numbers because you didn't give one of the key specifying facts about your options, the expiration date.)\n\n>Disneys (Put) price dropped moving closer to my Strike price which is bad for me.

I do not want to give up shares and they suggested that they'd write covered calls and rolling them.

The idea was to write calls roll them before it goes ITM and hope the premium is higher than the cost to close and pocket the difference.  \nI think it was working okay until the past few weeks.

The extended time gives the trade more time to profit and can also result in more extrinsic value to add to the net credits.  \n\nAn example is a short put sold for a $1 credit and a $100 max profit. If it goes ITM and the cost to close it will cost a $1.25 debit.  In a roll the put would be closed for $1.25 with a new trade a week or two farther out in time opened for a $1.75 total credit.  Adding up the credits - $1 initial + $1.75 from the roll = $2.75, then subtract the $1.25 debit = $2.75 - $1.25 = $1.50.  \n\nBy rolling the trade is given more time to possibly win and the profit moves from a $100 to a $150 max profit.  \n\nAs stated, rolling is simply closing one trade and opening another but in one order.
