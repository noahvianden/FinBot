I sold on Wed, and will be closing on Thur/Fri. Let's call that 1% return for 2 days. I think it's very high dont you think?\n\nThe reason I say \"high probability\" is because the stock has dropped 20% already since the new year, and my put is another 15% lower.

This was obtained from the upside dev, downside dev, and stdev of 2021-2023 earnings reports. The sample size is small but the confidence level is 97.5%. \n\nIt depends on what the $10,000 in capital is out of to get a real estimate of risk, but 1% seems like a really low reward for the risk.

Did a calendar spread, sold the Jan26 205P and bought the Feb16 205P.\n\nThe tricky thing about calendar calls around earnings is that most profit/loss calculators will be unduly optimistic because they assume constant volatility, and therefore give you too wide an area for profit. (Standard calculation is that I profit if TSLA is between $186 and $228 at the Jan26 expiration; this is certainly wrong, and the window is smaller.)\n\nObviously both expirations get a hard IV crush, the profit comes from a mixture of (a) how bad the IV crush is for the one you own and (b) how close you are to the spot price.  Pre-market, TSLA's at $189 which likely makes it a small loss for me, but if it bounces back towards $205, the value of the one I sold plummets while the later one is comparatively stable.\n\nBefore anyone lectures me: yes, this is a riskier trade than is typically promoted by the theta gang! Don't run out and do earnings calendar spreads! On a trade like this, profit is typically between 50% and 150%, depending on exit. Loss can be 100% (and theoretically >100%), but usually the loss is more like 50%-75%.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Yes calendars pnl are hard to figure out since it involves different expirations.

Obviously, the trade as a whole is still an unrealized loss.\n\nMy reasoning is that the morning put buying and call selling seems to have leveled off, and I am predicting a bounce upward at some point over the next week.
