He is a part time CEO. His top management team is filled with absolute superstars who are the real reason tesla executes as well as it does.\n\n\n2. We have been hearing about “competition is coming” for a decade now. Literally nobody (other than Chinese EV companies like BYD) are manufacturing and selling it at the scale Tesla is. They  are all 5 years behind at the minimum. Even then, they don’t own the entire stack like tesla does. Tesla makes everything from batteries, the electronics, even the processors, software, motors etc that go into the car. They are like the apple of cars. They design almost everything in house. That gives them a massive advantage. \n\n\n3. The “recall” was an over the air software update. \n\n\n4. EV adoption isn’t slowing down, sales of higher end cars are slowing down and that’s because of the larger economy and interest rates. EVs typically occupy the higher end of cars in terms of prices. People aren’t spending as much on new cars. It’s not an EV specific issue. Its an overall larger economy issue that will get resolved over time.\n\n\nBiggest advantage tesla has over other legacy (non Chinese) companies is that they already have years of experience, supplier network, installed manufacturing capacity. Every step Ford or GM takes is first of all slow as fuck, secondly, fought tooth and nail by the unions. Their dealership networks hate EVs as they don’t need as much maintenance and make them less cash. \n\n CEOs of Ford and GM don’t give a flying duck about where the company is going to be in 10 years. They wouldn’t be buying back shares if they did, they would throw everything they have at EVs. If Ford has invested the billions in the last decade that they bought back shares with, they would be competing with tesla for real by now. \n\nThese companies are structurally incapable of transforming to the extent needed. Look at the employee make up of Ford vs tesla. The skills and background are completely different. Ford would need to fire and replace atleast 50% of its company and replace them with people completely different skills. Zero chance the union would let that happen easily.  \n\nIt’s like asking a basketball player to play baseball. Even if you are Michal Jordan, you can’t. \n\nTesla’s real competition are Japanese and Chinese EVs.
