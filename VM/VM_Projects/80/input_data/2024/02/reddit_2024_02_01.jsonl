January was the busiest month for job cuts in the industry since March.\n\nLast month, Microsoft\n cut 1,900 positions in its gaming division; Google\n said it‚Äôs eliminating hundreds of roles across the company; and Amazon\n laid off employees across its Prime Video, MGM Studios, Twitch and Audible divisions.\n\nIn addition to Zoom, cloud software vendor Okta\n announced a downsizing on Thursday, telling employees that it‚Äôs laying off 400 staffers, or about 7% of its workforce.\n\nZoom exploded in popularity at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic as workers turned to the video-conferencing platform to stay in touch with colleagues, friends and family. But as the pandemic subsided and many workers returned to in-person roles, Zoom‚Äôs stock has stumbled.\n\nZoom shares are down about 10% this year and have dropped almost 90% from their record high in October 2020.\n\nLast February, Zoom cut around 1,300 workers, or about 15% of its workforce, as the company braced for the ‚Äúuncertainty of the global economy,‚Äù CEO Eric Yuan said at the time. The cuts in 2023 hit every organization across Zoom.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/01/zoom-layoffs-company-cuts-150-employees-2percent-of-workforce.html", "id": "1agm286", "created_utc": 1706822626.0, "score": 242, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 88, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 327, "replies": [{"body": "Lots of tech companies swelled their workforce with bloat during the latter 2020 and 2021 period and then almost all laid off a portion of those in the following period", "score": 61, "replies": [{"body": "I work in tech and if 1/4 of our company got laid off we probably be ok.
