Using longer-dated stuff on margin probably isn't taking full advantage of the BP efficiency that margin offers, so am more likely to utilize other strategies on margin than \"the wheel,\" with the general go-to being short strangles and straddles.\n\nAt a minimum, my expectation is that I receive 1% of the strike price in credit for 16 delta or less strikes at 45 DTE.  You can naturally be more aggressive with your delta, with the sweet spot kind of being in between the EM and 2 x EM strikes (i.e., between 16 and 30), with the commonly accepted strike for \"sweetness\" being the 25.  Even in that event, my expectation would be the same: 1% of the strike price in credit.\n\nIf the underlying simply isn't paying that at 45 days, that is a signal to you that that particular underlying isn't \"worth it\" in shorter duration, and you should either (a) scrounge around the market for something with higher IV; or (b) go out longer in duration if you must, always keeping an eye out for getting into shorter duration should that underlying weaken and/or experience a pop in IV.\n\nMy basic process in most things that I eventually anticipate having multiples on is to do a \"starter\" position (e.g., IWM April 19th 184 short put, 1.89 credit) and then look to add at intervals from there, depending on what the underlying does, with my primary goal being to add at strikes that are better than what I currently have on.  This could be an addition of a \"rung\" in the April expiry at a lower strike or an addition in a longer-dated expiry at a lower strike (e.g., IWM May 17th 178 short put, paying 1.83).   (I'm using IWM an example here, because premium in QQQ and SPY blows chunks at the moment in shorter duration).  I then proceed to manage individual rungs from there, taking profit outright, or rolling to lock in realized gains.\n\nFor me personally, I don't look at longer duration as the \"go-to\" approach.  It's an approach that you use in lower volatility environments to have ***some*** BP deployed while you wait for a more productive IV environment in shorter duration to occur and can be part of an overall plan to have a portion of BP devoted to longer-dated stuff and a portion reserved for shorter-dated.
