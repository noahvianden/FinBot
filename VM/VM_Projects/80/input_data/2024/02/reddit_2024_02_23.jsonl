I could be wrong.\n\n5) a continuation of 4, if Tesla achieves this, robo taxis will be widely available. There are about 3.5 million Uber drivers today, and 4 million teslas cars out there today, and over a million per year being added. Even if Waymo worked everywhere, which it doesn’t, even if it wasn’t too expensive, which it is, even if it could scale, which we don’t if how well they can… (even just how many remote workers per 100 cars do they need?) they’d need to produce these things at massive scale to catch up to teslas potential which by any expectation would be years away.\n\n\nJust to add some color. Waymo recently had a software recall as two of its cars hit the same truck (last week). This has paused its LA expansion. This is to say Waymo has its issues too. It’s fleet size as of august was still only 350 cars.

Feel free to engage in any of the points I raised.\n\nPoint is, proof is in the pudding and the approaches are very different, and the availability approach is very different for this pudding proof.\n\nIf Tesla achieves what they want, it’ll be a sudden availability of millions of vehicles all over the world. Their system is scalable , doesn’t matter how many cars or location really. \n\nWaymo by comparison is not scalable on that level. They have remote drivers at the ready, they require maps predefined. \n\nSo Waymo might be ahead in certain scenarios but you can’t make that claim on the whole. I can use FSD in a Tesla in Canada. I cannot use Waymo, it’s not here. \n\nPeople have been saying Waymo can do set driving for over a year now, yet look how they have scaled? They havnt. They barely grew. Infact LA halted roll out recently due to some edgecase that caused multiple Waymo cars to crash into the same parked truck. \n\nYou have to constrain your claim that they are ahead. Tesla roll out for example is WAY ahead (4 million teslas capable of using their FSD beta on the road right now. Waymo? 350). Tesla FSD is available all over North America right now. Waymo? A handful of cities.  In Toronto Canada, tesla is infinitely ahead as FSD works to some degree and Waymo doesn’t at all. \n\nAs I say, proof is and will be in the pudding.
