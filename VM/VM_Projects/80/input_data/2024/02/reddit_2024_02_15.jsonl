{"title": "Is Berkshire Hathaway's Hidden Mystery Stock Purchase Tesla? ($BRK.A, $TSLA)", "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/7m7dix6tdric1.gif\n\nBerkshire Hathaway's recent request for confidential treatment from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding the purchase of undisclosed stock(s) has sparked speculation. This move, aimed at concealing specific investments from public knowledge, suggests a strategic play by CEO Warren Buffett to continue acquiring shares without influencing the stock price. Such tactics allow Berkshire to amass significant positions at lower costs, given that any disclosed investment by Berkshire often leads to a surge in the stock's price as investors rush to emulate Buffett's moves. This scenario unfolds as Berkshire Hathaway navigates the complexities of the current financial landscape, leveraging its considerable influence and capital to optimize its investment strategy.\n\nI have a theory that the secret accumulation of Tesla shares by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, if true, could represent a significant shift in Buffett's investment strategy, recognizing the tech and automotive sectors' transformative potential. This move could symbolize a meeting of minds between Buffett and Elon Musk, particularly with Musk's engagement in the Giving Pledge, initiated by Buffett. The potential synergy could redefine investment philosophies toward tech enterprises and forecast the impact of autonomous driving on the insurance industry, notably affecting Berkshire's Geico. This theory suggests a future where Musk's tech innovation and Buffett's investment savvy might reshape the automotive and insurance landscapes, especially in auto insurance risk management in the autonomous vehicle era.\n\nI wouldn't put it past Buffett's team to be running a secretly coordinated campaign to negatively impact Tesla's narrative and share price. The coordinated stories of recalls that are merely software updates could be one example of this strategy. This approach would not only serve to depress Tesla's stock price, allowing Berkshire Hathaway to accumulate a more significant share at a lower cost but also exemplify the lengths to which Buffett's team might go to secure a strategic advantage in the market. This calculated move would underscore the depth of strategy employed by Berkshire Hathaway, manipulating market perceptions to favor their investment goals.", "id": "1argk38", "created_utc": 1708007040.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.49, "num_comments": 92, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|10|**First Seen In WSB**|3 years ago\n**Total Comments**|770|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|18 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I don't own TSLA but I own SoFi, so i'm going with that answer.", "score": 23, "replies": [{"body": "I could see that", "score": -4, "replies": []}, {"body": "$PYPL too, these bags are heavy", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "no", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "Well what do you think it‚Äôs gonna be?", "score": -9, "replies": [{"body": "Intel", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Lol why would buffet who owns BYD buy tesla, overvalued by every reasonable metric possible", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Because he realized he picked the wrong horse but is interested in electric cars", "score": -11, "replies": [{"body": "Man what copium are you smoking, he is up 5x to 6x in his BYD investments", "score": 11, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 33, "replies": [{"body": "I've read several books on buffet and musk they have some synergies in values if you go past the clickbait stories and drill into the business you would see.", "score": -21, "replies": [{"body": "Would these synergies be that they both eat food and shit it back out?", "score": 15, "replies": [{"body": "Well, as far as Musk goes, I've caught him shitting out of his mouth on several occasions.", "score": 4, "replies": []}, {"body": "They are both mission driven vs short term greed", "score": -5, "replies": [{"body": "Yes, but one has the brain of a super old dementia patient that's close to death.
