{"title": "Earning plays for max tendies tonight", "selftext": "ITS THAT TIME AGAIN BABY!!!!!! Yesterday I posted my earnings plays, and got 3/4 correct (KHC missed earnings but they're flat pre market, so you could say I went 3.5/4)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Sure ABNB did the good ol GUH, but luckily I sold the top in the after market. And thanks to the fat fingered intern my LYFT position will only net a measly couple hundred bucks now……](https://preview.redd.it/7q1lmp062kic1.png?width=710&format=png&auto=webp&s=48ab3f7272ba153129e26ac504624f78b76da88e)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut no one cares a fuck about yesterday, you’re here to make money again, so lets get right into it:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. **UPWK** \\- I read a WSJ Pro article last week saying the founder is partnering up with some hedge fund to buy back his company and regain control after they ousted him back in 2019, call me tinfoil, but I think upwork doesn’t want their stock to tank 30% tomorrow, and have mister founder back, so they will beat tonight. I know the company that the WSJ is talking about is actually wework, but they’re basically the same company. Maybe they’ll partner up to become one big company, called We Up. CEO is smoking hot as well\n2. **CROX** \\- If theres one thing to buy for life, this thing will be at the top, l got a pair of crocs myself, bought it 6 years ago, still looks brand new. Every time my crocs start to smell like stinky feet, I just put them on and dance in the shower, 20 minutes later they're dry. You know those charms you can put in the holes of them? Those suckers are 5 bucks EACH, kids want them all these days, decorating your crocs is more expensive than the whole shoe itself . Im also seeing a big bullish classic flag pattern on the 5year chart, expect some some green dildos tmrw morning\n3. **FSLY** \\- AI is booming, all companies are begging for cloud services, I have honestly no idea what this company does, but google said it’s a cloud provider. Fastly never missed earnings btw, so this thing will skyrocket.\n4. **QS** \\- Quantumscape makes electric car batteries, who even wants to drive electric cars these days? These guys missed their last 3 earnings, im seeing a lot of open interest at $6 and $7 puts. im following big money tonight. Stock is up 75% since last earnings, way overvalued. This thing will go tits up..… I will short it\n\n&#x200B;\n\n( TLDR: market got shit on yesterday, 70% of you became 🌈🐻, no recession coming, only up from here, stonks only go up, except for QS. See you guys in valhalla )\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy position:\n\n[casino is open fellas. still europoor. still trading 5x-leveraged CFD's, lets get this bag tonight](https://preview.redd.it/w8svl0esykic1.png?width=860&format=png&auto=webp&s=0dea97f92c79b5eb5e23474b8415b002e703adc1)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*This isnt financial advice, don't sue me, do your own research, don't follow me, you will lose money*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: My positions and correcting my use of the term 'tits up', sorry for the misunderstanding.", "id": "1aqnbm3", "created_utc": 1707918618.0, "score": 107, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 90, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|2|**First Seen In WSB**|2 weeks ago\n**Total Comments**|12|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 month|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Hayden brown is not smoking hot\n\nWhich leads me to question this entire post.", "score": 65, "replies": [{"body": "Maybe when compared to the majority of other CEO's 🤔🤔🤔", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "Begs the question, who is the hottest CEO?", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/coiwpmnhakic1.jpeg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cd558bfbe14adb0a8c3aff57cba8c90efc1122ed", "score": 32, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "I mean, the net worth of $29M adds to the hotness.
