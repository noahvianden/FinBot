{"title": "The Problem with Rolling: A Mindset Shift", "selftext": "I’ve been trading for 6 years now, and a mental trap I’ve noticed both new and experienced traders fall into is the idea that rolling is a great way to adjust a position and prevent losses. I’m here to offer a different perspective. \n\nNow don’t get me wrong, the effect of rolling can certainly turn a losing trade into a winning one, at least in the mind of the trader. \n\nBut there’s a couple issues I want to highlight that aren’t commonly discussed here. \n\nThe reality is rolling is really just closing out a losing trade, followed by opening a trade with equivalent risk parameters further out in time. This can be fine if some analysis is done beforehand, but is not fine if done as an automatic response to a loss. \n\nThe issue with this is that the reason you’re rolling in the first place, presumably, is because the market went against your trade. Now a lot of the time the market will mean revert, and that’s why some may say they’ve experienced success with rolling. \n\nBut in the case where the market is trending hard against you, such as in a market crash or a big bullish melt up, not recognizing the trend and rolling anyway can get you into a lot of trouble. \n\nRolling a trade into a market trend will tie up more capital for longer periods of time with each roll. At some point, you will roll so far out of the money and so far out in time that massive amounts of your capital will be tied up for potentially years. If you backtest selling and rolling puts prior to the COVID crash and moving into it, you'll see that this is true. \n\nNow some may say they’re fine with this as long as the trade doesn’t lose. But this mindset is silly. The reason why we should be trading is to achieve a good risk-adjusted return per unit of time. \n\nThat last part about time is key. When you tie up your capital for long periods of time, you may feel like you’re not losing, but the truth is you may suffer from major opportunity cost. Which is exactly the same thing as a real loss. Because time and money, and the time value of money are inseparably linked together. \n\nThis also applies to things like taking assignment of stock, or having your shares getting called away due to selling a covered call. \n\nWhile your capital is tied up, you could have been pursuing other opportunities better suited to the market condition, if only you had closed out your losing trade for a loss instead of doing mental gymnastics to force a winner.\n\nThe alternative to the \"rolling\" mindset is to see it for what it really is-- closing a losing trade and opening a similar one further out in time/money. Before doing this, it would be wise to consider if it is really the best move. In the long run, its often not, and this can be confirmed via backtesting.", "id": "1at52vb", "created_utc": 1708185325.0, "score": 68, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 92, "comments": [{"body": "I’m just learning this now.

Rolling can turn a losing trade into a winning one. It can also turn a winning trade into a losing one. You can use it to alter your risk profile by adding or subtracting risk or time. If the stock has moved a considerable distance away from your strikes, you can use it to squeeze more juice out of the position and keep a winning trade going. I think you should have just left the \"in the mind of the trader\" part out because the goal of rolling is moving risk and option greeks within the parameters of the individual's trading strategy. \n\n\n>The reality is rolling is really just closing out a losing trade, followed by blindly (i.e. without wider analysis of the market condition) opening a trade with equivalent risk parameters further out in time. \n\nWhat I said above applies to this point as well. Rolling a trade whether you were right or wrong is just adjusting to current market conditions. Whether the trader timed it wrong, the strikes are being tested, they just want a simple delta correction, or they want more time (for a mean reversion) to be right/reduction in gamma exposure then rolling is what they should do.\n\n>While your capital is tied up, you could have been pursuing other opportunities better suited to the market condition, if only you had closed out your losing trade for a loss instead of doing mental gymnastics to force a winner.\n\nA better way to say this in a less insulting way is to encourage people to be okay with the risk they take on when opening a trade. If new to options people are going to be risk defined so the max profit and max loss are fixed. I would say learning to be ok with that and also being able to sit on it and trust the probability when you entered the trade will help you sit on that position until it either moves back in your favor without having to touch any of the strikes, or simply become a loss from which you move on, because risk management should be a thing you've worked on.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Fair enough.

Honestly, I see a lack of logic in the post, which is more like a knee-jerk (emotional) reaction to some posts on this subreddit by novice traders. \n\nThe most recent post I read was about a trader rolling out a covered call way into the future to avoid losing their shares of NVDA since the short call was ITM. If that's an example of what you're talking about then I see it more as a matter of entering the wrong type of trade for their goals and subsequently rolling into an unfavorable trade in terms of the sweet spot of taking advantage of theta decay. In my opinion, that trade should have been exited for the win it is, and the capital freed up to do other profitable trades, which you touched on in your original post.\n\nIf we look at the primary reason for rolling options in let's say a strangle, it's a defensive move because the stock has moved and by making an adjustment you get more credit to offset a loss. You get your delta adjustment and lower the loss of a trade that got tested by rolling the untested side. Rolling is better than doing nothing in terms of average P/L by reducing losses, just like early management can reduce tail risk even though holding until expiration can lead to a recovery of the loss.

I agree it’s totally stupid to roll more than 3 months ( either 3 times one month or 3 months in one go ), this is because your opprtunity lost is too great. People took the risk of being assigned the moment they sold the option and they were happy owning the underlying or getting rid of it at the agreed price regardless what the price does. If this wasn’t the case, it’s a big mistake.\n\nWhy I also disagree is, rolling is great precisely for letting the price revert to the mean after a big move up or down. Not only that, you still have a lot of theta to burn if you can roll 1-3 months out. Longer than that there is no point as theta burns down very slowly.  You can even go down in strike if you sold at high IV and it then crushed (e.g after earnings). \n\nTo give an example i recently sold a PYPL put before earnings with 4DTE, IV was very high. Stock crashed to a dollar under my strike, i was able to roll one month out and one dollar down in strike purely because IV collapsed. Stock now floats above that strike and I will soon be able to close in profit. Nothing wrong with that but if I would have to roll out for longer it wouldn’t make any sense at all. I am happy owning the underlying so assignment is really not a big deal.
