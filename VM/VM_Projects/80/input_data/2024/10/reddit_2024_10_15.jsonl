{"title": "Opinion:  The 10/10 ‘We, Robot’ event was not for YOU.", "selftext": "Watching the reactions online in the intervening days since the event, I see a lot of people complaining that they were expecting X/Y/Z but that Tesla didn’t deliver.  Whether it was the lack of a $25k car, the lack of hard numbers for the their near-term auto business plans, or the lack of a “no asterisk” FSD service this year, people had expectations that were not met.  To be fair to Tesla though, they never made any promises about what the event would deliver, and as such, any disappointment on the viewer’s part is down to their own mismanaged expectations.\n\n\n\nThe 10/10 event was not:\n\n-a recruitment drive to impress potential hires.\n\n-a quarterly conference call to provide raw data to investors.\n\n-an announcement of a consumer product available just in time for Christmas.\n\n-a pathway to increasing manufacturing efficiency.\n\n-a way to increase the stock price.\n\n\n\nIf not the above then, what was the ‘We, Robot’ event, and who was it for?\n\n\n\nCall me naive if you want, but put simply, the event was to help “decision makers” open their eyes to what the future holds in store once they stop holding on to the old ways.  Too many people will automatically reject something that sounds too hopeful or ambitious without ever exploring whether or not it’s feasible.  Think of how many people currently still think electric vehicles are a niche product that will never replace gas cars as the primary means of powering transportation, despite the clear evidence of their superiority.  Now take that same concept and apply it to a much more nebulous subject like AI/machine-intelligence, and it’s no wonder that a lot of people just don’t get it.\n\n\n\nThe event allegedly hosted a number of guests from other car companies, manufacturing companies and people involved with legislation (no source for this other than first-hand accounts from people on social media).  The 10/10 ‘We, Robot’ event was a big party to get these people to understand that the future is within our grasp, and that Tesla is doing its part to make it happen.  There’s nothing like seeing something in person for yourself to shake you out of your preconceptions, and Tesla knows that.  Tesla and its people are proud of the work they’re doing, can see where they’re headed, and wants everyone else to know.\n\n\n\nAs Franz said at the start of the show, this all about visions for the future.\n\n\n\nRegarding transportation, Tesla envisions clean and cheap mass-transit, the reclamation of valuable land currently squandered on parking lots, an increase in pedestrian and occupant safety, and the transformation of the daily commute from a stress-inducing activity to a fun and enjoyable one.\n\n\n\nRegarding robots, Tesla envisions the single most useful tool a citizen could own: a fully dextrous and intelligent personal assistant.  One which could help you with your daily chores, protect your property while you’re away, enable differently-abled people to have opportunities they've never had before, act as sacrificial replacements for dangerous jobs/activities, spur the next economic and industrial revolution, and all for a cost that the average family could afford.\n\n\n\nSo Tesla’s goal was quite simple: throw a party with good food and booze, invite people in positions of influence within the industry, and bring them face to face with cool as hell technology that will get them excited for the future again.  So when Tesla comes calling for a new part for their vehicle, the manufacturers will not hesitate to invest in the needed upgrades, knowing that Tesla will have their back, along with the competitors who have decided to make the switch as well.  When legislation is needed to ensure FSD gets a fair shake, policy makers will be less likely to set up roadblocks to delay the inevitable.  When rating agencies and institutional investors assess the business as a whole, they can do so accurately.  Because they GET IT now.\n\n\n\nSo criticize Tesla all you want for missed timelines, shifting priorities, and partial successes, this event wasn’t designed to satisfy your concerns.
