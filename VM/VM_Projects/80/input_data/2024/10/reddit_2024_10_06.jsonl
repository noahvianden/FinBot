{"title": "Despite ridiculous P/E‚Äôs the risk of not buying outweighs that of buying.", "selftext": "\nSome  believe we‚Äôre seeing a repeat of 2021, when price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios seemed irrelevant and the market was overly optimistic. While the current market does have a feeling of a ridiculous bullish sentiment( caught, cough NVDIA ) , the macroeconomic conditions differ significantly from 2021.\n\nToday, things seem to once again be irrational, I agree to a certain limit . It‚Äôs difficult when even stocks  like Costco  have fan boys attempting to downplay the importance of valuation, P/E since they are ridiculously high, ratios still matter. \n\nHOWEVER.  Today is much more different then 2021 \n\nPlease  consider the broader context. For instance, the ongoing geopolitical tensions, including wars, have different implications now than in 2021. The Russia Ukrainian war was the only ‚Äúinvasion‚Äù  that did not see the market gain  some short time after.  Every other invasion was a buying opportunity.  Why ?\n\nBack in 2021, the Federal Reserve was tightening monetary policy, which restrained the market‚Äôs ability to recover from geopolitical tensions, such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict. This time, we are in a much more stable environment, characterized by a decrease in interested rates with a robust American economy,  the exact opposite of 2021 \n\n- Strong job reports\n- Declining interest rates\n- Falling inflation\n- Invasion signal a buying opportunity the Middle East tensions have had zero impacts. \n- Oil is nowhere near as impactful as it once  was in its golden days \n - Emerging technological advancements related to AI and robotics\n\nThese factors contribute to a sense of American economic exceptionalism. So, while it‚Äôs natural to be cautious, there are strong reasons to remain optimistic about stock market opportunities. \n\n\nI believe that the risk of missing out on buying shares outweighs the risk of investing during market dips. Just like the major tech companies have invested heavily in areas like NVIDIA and chips, they ultimately need to deliver profits. However, the real danger lies in not investing at all.\n\n\nDon‚Äôt let fear hold you back from investing", "id": "1fxog3z", "created_utc": 1728242401.0, "score": 112, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 86, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 10 | **First Seen In WSB** | 2 years ago\n**Total Comments** | 187 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 2 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "It's still a good time to diversify into some measure of fixed income.
