Do you think the stock has run up too much before earnings or not?\n\n\nI know the overall trend for Nvidia is up - it’s a great stock next year to five years especially - but anyone else feel like we are already pricing in an earnings beat and a dip is coming? I have no doubt Blackwell sales, revenue... will be great but it wasn't but a week and a half ago we were all really glad this stock finally broke $130 again. Now it's broken multiple record highs ahead of earnings \n\nI'm not trying to be bearish but it just feels like a big run up that is expecting an earnings beat that leaves little room post earnings. I say that because last earnings was pretty good but not excellent out of the water and just worried the same will happen again. I just feel like with Blackwell shipping in mass starting the end of this year, that 2025 is the big year for Nvidia more so than October 2024.\n\nMarket overall has run up a lot and feels like it should pull back before Christmas rally in late November and December. Plus there’s a lot of election uncertainty that could affect the overall market if there's a lot of litigation or a contested election\n\n\nBasically, I feel like we definitely reach $200 sometime next year based on continued beats and incredible demand for Blackwell and Nvidia having its hands in all things AI - just wondering if short term we're overbought ", "id": "1g8zytt", "created_utc": 1729542653.0, "score": 94, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 94, "comments": [{"body": "You have to put things in context..
