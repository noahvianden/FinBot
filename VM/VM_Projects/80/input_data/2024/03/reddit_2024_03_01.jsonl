Looks to be the activist investor showdown of the year, if not the decade.   \nHere’s a graphic from the Wall Street Journal about who owns Disney’s stock (which is from this article: Who’s Who in the Battle Over Disney’s Board, February 6) [https://imgur.com/gallery/t9mbjQg](https://imgur.com/gallery/t9mbjQg)  \n\n\n  \nBasically it’s  \n\\- Insiders: 0.03%  \n\\- Institutional investors: 64%  \n\\- Retail investors and others: 35%  \n\n\n  \nNot surprising is Trian’s 1.8% ownership. And of the others institutional investors, there’s the not unusual names who manage ETFs like VG, Blackrock, and State Street.   \n\n\n  \nBut then there’s the long tail of institutions who own just a little chuck of Disney.  \n\n\n  \nBut most surprising and unusual is the 35% of stock that’s owned by individual retail investors. I don’t know how to find the latest statistics on this, but as of 2017, the average S&P 500 company only had 12% of its stock owned by retail investors. Even though 35% for Disney doesn’t seem very high it’s actually an outlier relative to other companies.  \n\n\n  \nWhat are the chances Trian or blackwells actually gets a board seat?", "id": "1b48uhm", "created_utc": 1709335068.0, "score": 476, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 84, "comments": [{"body": "Not that surprising.
