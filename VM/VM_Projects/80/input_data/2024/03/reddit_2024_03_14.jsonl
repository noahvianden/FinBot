None of that is true now.\nPeople associate that more with airbus, even passengers moan when they get onto a Boeing plane compared to an Airbus plane.\n\nBetween Boeing and Airbus, Airbus has most of the advantages;\n--Airbus that is building new air frames (takes decades to get them approved and is expensive). Boeing does not.\n--Airbus typically has better fuel efficiency.\n--Boeing has cheaper replacement parts however if recent news is anything to go by, the planes are shoddily built now and need more replacement parts.\n--Boeing has had planes crashing because of the plane (the whole MCAS scandal).\n--Boeing has had planes catching fire (battery problems).\n--Boeing had a door rip off mid flight recently!\n--Boeing has security problems (where you can just lift the carpet in some planes and access all of the computers (this control the plane) without any locks between the passengers).\n--Boeing seems to always be caught in scandals.\n--the board in Boeing (for the last 15-20 years) were focused on cutting business costs and quality dropped and innovation stopped.
