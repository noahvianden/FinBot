(Which never happened.)\n* I am just kicking myself for being dumb for not letting my shares get assigned early on and sell CSP on it.\n* Had I held onto NVDA without selling CC back in January, I could have been easily up by $30k+ since NVDA is now sitting at $820ish.\n\nAs my cost basis for my shares is below $510 (which is my current strike price), I wouldn't call this a net loss as I still \"made\" money. However, the opportunity cost and the fact that I ended up capping my $30k+ profit just saddens me so bad at this point. Even when my shares get assigned, I'll need to add $30k+ to start selling CSP on it as there's over $300 gap between my strike price and the current share price. (It wouldn't make sense for me to add $30k+ just to sell CSP on NVDA anyways. I could use the money I earned to sell CSP on other stocks.)\n\nA few stupid emotional decisions costed me a lot and I guess I really learned this the hard way.\n\nWhat would have been the best move on a trade like this? I should have let my shares get called away on that initial trade and minimize the loss, correct? (technically speaking, I shouldn't be calling this a loss but an opportunity cost.) What would you guys have done on a situation like this?", "id": "1b4g3by", "created_utc": 1709355721.0, "score": 60, "upvote_ratio": 0.74, "num_comments": 95, "comments": [{"body": "No one ever went broke taking profit.\n\nLet your shares get called away.

Also should be bare minimum R2 on anything, no point to risk money for less. Never do anything without confirmation. Always have a reason to get into something and a reason of why your entry point is what it is. I typically chart the night before, using pivot points as my points of reference, along with obvious patterns and trends.  Always have a plan.  Decisions are pre determined before entry.   I typically don‚Äôt hold longer than one day, but that‚Äôs just how I like to trade.  There is more to it than that, but I‚Äôve put a lot of time into refining a strategy that 7-10x my starting stack every week (I compound trade) and it is exhausting so I get sick of explaining it.

You are risking your whole stack every time so if you don‚Äôt us a stop loss, you are going to lose big. That being said, if you entries are good, 10% is plenty of an enough cushion to not get stopped out with a good entry.   Pay attention to your pivot points and what the chart is doing for the entry. For example yesterday I had Tesla charted.  It dropped for the first part of the day but it bounced literally exactly at my first support based on my pivot points.  At that time the entry was clear.   Tesla went up like $5 from that point.   Don‚Äôt ever force an entry, always let it confirm. You can see the breakout or bounce coming.

You didn't lose any money at all. \n\nI had 100 shares of SMCI at an avg cost of around $265 and sold a call at $280. Needless to say, I lost out on a whole bunch of profit too and only made $3k or so. I would have rather made $70k. Oh well. I only owned 100 shares because I was assigned them on a short put. I was wheeling the stock specially for premium. So I wouldn't have owned them otherwise. \n\nYes, sometime missing out on additional profit feels worse than literally LOSING money.
