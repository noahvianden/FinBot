{"title": "NVDA $1000 highly likely now", "selftext": "There‚Äôs a gravity well type effect in the stock market.  Whenever a stock or an index gets within spitting distance of a key price point, it will always gravitates to that price point.  \n\nNvidia is now too close to the $1000 to stop and peak early.  Chances are we‚Äôll see $1000 this year regardless of what comes next.\n\nThe broader market is way overdue for a correction.  So Nvidia may pull back a bit. \n\nBut once the next leg up begins in the market, nvidia goes to $1000.  \n\nIf the market doesn‚Äôt peak in the next few weeks ‚Äî and there‚Äôs a very high probably that it will given certain time/price oscillator I don‚Äôt want to go get into ‚Äî then Nvidia will likely see $1000 in the next four weeks. \n\nSo it‚Äôs either (1) market peak, market correction, bottom and next leg higher by mid-summer = Nvidia $1000 by fall; or (2) market goes sideways and Nvidia grinds to $1000 in the next four weeks.  \n\nOnce Nvidia does reach $1000 ‚Äî and it very much will ‚Äî it will probably run to as high as $1200-$1300 before it has its first massive correction that brings it down 30-40%.  Like Tesla or Apple or google or every other stock that saw rapid repricing.  \n\nAnd this has NOTHING to do with fundamental.  It‚Äôs all profit taking, technicals driven.  \n\nWhen a stock reprices rapidly like Nvidia justifiably has, it will crash and burn.  No matter how strong the fundamentals are.  \n\nDon‚Äôt believe me.  Go look at apple in 2012. It had STRONGER fundamentals than Nvidia had right now RELATIVE to its price.  \n\nApple was trading at an 19 P/E ratio growing at 100% a year with massive future expected growth.  Everyone had consensus $1000+ price targets on Apple and it was all justified.  And Apple did surpass that $1000 by several thousand (post split) but not before it crashed and everyone freaked out.  \n\nAt peak high 19 TRIALING P/E ratio, Apple fell from $705 down to $388 and traded under a 10 P/E ratio and had 65% of its market cap in cash.  It could have taken itself private if stayed there for any extended period of it.  It didn‚Äôt.  \n\nAnd there was not a solitary reason anyone could point to.  There was no earnings slowdown.  No earnings miss.  Nothing.  The fundamental were stock as can be.  \n\nThe stock simply rallied from $150 the year earlier all the way to $705.  People took profits and the stock fell 40% down to $388.  It then rallied back to $700 split, did it again, split again and did it again and split again.  \n\nJust saying.  Get ready for the ride.  It will for sure crash.  Once it reaches $1000, you‚Äôre an idiot if you continue holding.  Unless you‚Äôre a long term investor and don‚Äôt mind the roller coaster ride from $1200 to $600 back up to $1200 again.  In which case, enjoy.

I don‚Äôt believe you do.  I‚Äôm not saying that ONLY because these other stocks fell on repricing/revaluation that therefore Nvidia will.  I‚Äôm giving you them as examples.  \n\nThe reason they fall on revaluation is induced profit taking.  \n\nLet me give you an example.  Suppose Fred buys $100k in Nvidia leaps.  Nvidia flies to $1300 and now they‚Äôre worth $4m.  This is life changing for Fred.  It happens all the time.  \n\nNvidia starts pulling back in a normal correction.  His $4M drops to $3.5M.  Others with less conviction start selling, it drops to $3M.  That‚Äôs now the biggest swing Fred has seen.  \n\nIt falls further to $2.75 million.  Fred is now like screw this, I‚Äôm out.  \n\nThis is the effect that happens on correction,  when so many have such massive built in profits and they start to see those profits drop.  Or worse yet, say they‚Äôre down because they‚Äôve bought at $1100 and now it‚Äôs sitting at $900, that‚Äôs all downside pressure on the stock.  Corrections become exaggerated.  \n\nThis only occurs during massive repricing.  When a stock climbs 15-30% a year on stable volume with a stable base of investors, you don‚Äôt get the weak hand effect.  \n\nNvidia isn‚Äôt impervious to this effect.  It will see a 30-40% correction at some point. \n\nWill it stand?  No.  But it will happen.  From peak to through.  It will then recover.  \n\nDon‚Äôt worry.  I‚Äôll come back here and bump this happens.  I‚Äôve been trading since 1997.  I‚Äôve seen a lot of markets.

So yeah, I can report right back on that right now.  \n\nSecondly; it isn‚Äôt the $1000 price that sends a stock torpedoing down.  It‚Äôs how much profit taking had happened during the ascent.  And there‚Äôs almost no selling volume in Nvidia.  The up/down volume ratio is insanely skewed to the buy side.  That‚Äôs is precisely what causes huge sell-offs after a rapid revaluation like we‚Äôve seen.  \n\nYou must have almost no experience in the stock if you don‚Äôt know this by now.\n\nEdit: you can be contentious or learn something here.  What you want to see is the stock retracing half its gains before moving higher.  The S&P 500‚Äôs longest rally in 20-years happened in 2016-2017.  It ran for 300+ trading days for 40% returns.  But it only moved up about 0.11% per day on average.  Now what separated that long rally from other rallies that all fizzled out at day 60-100, is that the SPy was constantly retracing its gains.  There were almost no built in profits.  It would go up 2-3 days and then drop 1-2 days.  It was a constant shallow move higher.  \n\nAll the other rallies were sharp, high octane moves to the upside with big built in profits and unsurprisingly, 50% of the gains are retraced on correction.  \n\nThat doesn‚Äôt mean it goes down 50%.  It just loses 50% of the gains it generated between the preceding bottom of the last correction to the top. \n\nLet me give you an example.  The NASDAQ-100 (QQQ), recently rallied from $284 up to $388 last year without ever rally retracing any gains.  When it finally corrected in July 2023, it fell from $388 down to $342.

NVIDIA could easily shrug off a market correction.   \n\nHowever, if it‚Äôs a 10% sell-off probably not.  Why?  Because it‚Äôs risk reduction and algorithms.  \n\nListen carefully here.  In 2008, when the financial crisis happened, everything fell 60%.  It didn‚Äôt matter how strong the fundamentals were.  Google; apple, Microsoft et al.  They all dropped 60%.  \n\nApple just introduced the iPhone only a year earlier.  Think about that.  Apple was growing its revenues at 300% per year.  Its earnings quadrupled.  The stock fell from $200 in January 2008 to $78 in March 2009.  \n\nThat‚Äôs due to general derisking.  Look at yesterday for example.  Market down 2% and Nvidia struggled to stay positive.

The retailer will continue to offer its free Target Circle loyalty program that offers special deals and sales throughout the year.\n\nTarget did not immediately say how much it would cost.\n\nThe big-box retailer is turning to the new revenue stream as it tries to boost weaker sales. Its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings and revenue reported Tuesday beat Wall Street‚Äôs expectations, but its comparable sales have declined three quarters in a row.\n\nWith the move, Target is also following in the footsteps of retailers that have turned membership fees into a money maker and a sales driver. Amazon launched its Prime program in 2005, with perks like free two-day delivery and streaming of popular movies and original TV shows. It costs $139 per year or $14.99 per month, with the video membership-only option of $8.99 per month.\n\nWalmart launched its program, called Walmart+, in 2020. It costs $98 per year or $12.95 per month, with perks like free shipping, free grocery deliveries for orders of at least $35 and gas discounts.\n\nTarget is turning to its competitors‚Äô playbook for a reason: Walmart CEO Doug McMillon told investors on the company‚Äôs earnings call in February that Walmart+ members spend nearly twice as much as non-members and buy more over the course of a year.\n\nWalmart has not said how many people subscribe to Walmart+, but its CFO John David Rainey said on the earnings call that its membership continues to grow by double-digit percentages.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/05/target-launches-paid-membership-target-circle-360.html", "id": "1b77k5h", "created_utc": 1709651615.0, "score": 244, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 87, "comments": [{"body": "I‚Äôm so tired of everything becoming a subscription.
