Imagine an account this past Friday holding 1,000 call options for MSTR that expired on 2/15 at a strike of 1780. That option represents 100% of the account and also 100% of the account holders net worth. Notionally based on Friday‚Äôs close that would be worth $48,000. Now, it gets exercised by the broker/clearinghouse and Monday morning assuming MSTR opens at the same 1780.48 the account is long 100,000 shares for a value of $178,048,000 (roughly 1/5 of a billion dollars) and also short on cash of $178,000,000. The account and account owner are still worth 48,000. But instead over the weekend there is news of massive accounting fraud at MSTR and it opens at $50 a share. Now the account long value is 100,000x50 = $5,000,000, but short cash of $178,000,000 - the net value of the account is -$173,000,000.   I mean at that point there is no point of going after the individual for the funds and the broker will have to make the trade whole and they will take a massive hit. \n\nUnlikely? Yes. Impossible? Not at all. This is why the broker sells your call options on your behalf on Friday afternoons. \n\nBut keep going with the thought experiment- say on this past Friday MSTR traded the whole day around 1500 and just shot up remarkably to 1780.48 from 3:55-4:00pm EST. Because the option was far out of the money at 3:50pm (when it was bought) it was bought for just 0.01 per contact for a total outlay of $1,000.  There is no way the broker has the time to understand what is about to happen and they may not react fast enough to sell at 3:56pm. \n\nThis is the key difference between an option and a future. As the holder of an option I have the *option* to exercise, not the obligation.   If I have a futures contract I am obligated to execute at the predetermined date/price. \n\nThe more I think about it the more I am convinced there is no way as the holder of a long option you loss is any more than 100% of your buy price.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "The options clearing corporation auto exercises itm options, and you will find that most brokerages default to this unless you send in a do not exercise request, if you somehow make past their close out period checks. You can check your terms of service for your account where they will specifically have a section on how this is done for your particular broker. \n\nThis is also why many stock brokers have maximum exposure limit on the number of contracts your account type can hold. Eg retail accounts without margin approval at my brokerage can only hold 77 contracts of Google for example. This way they limit their own exposure.\n\nThe thing about not losing more than 100% of your account is not relevant here, because it‚Äôs not the same position anymore.\n\nAll of this is well documented, if you don‚Äôt feel like reading the 100 page contracts, just go to WSB.

Say you are about to declare bankruptcy, you have $10k in a brokerage account and a $100k judgement against you. Take that $10k and buy an ever so slightly ITM option at 3:59:55pm on Friday. Using our example say you pick up MSTR 1780 calls and you get them for 0.10 cents. You can buy 1,000 of those (assuming the brokerage allows that). Now based on what you are saying they will auto exercise on Saturday. You will have 100,000 shares of MSTR and a -178,000,000 cash in the account.   Now MSTR opens Monday at 1790. Sell at open, get the opening cross, collect 179,000,000 and pay back your -178,000,000 - bingo- you just became a millionaire with exactly $1,000,000. Now pay that $100k judgement and you still have $900k to run your life with.   If MSTR opened lower at 1770 then you just go ahead and declare bankruptcy like you were planning anyways.    \n\nNow that‚Äôs a massive share sale and I get that the market may not be deep enough to sell 100,000 shares without a price hit, but the underlying point remains.
