{"title": "Destruction of 0dtes during FOMC rally ", "selftext": "Can anyone explain what caused the violent drop in 0dte call prices today during the rally? SPY 521c were at .50 before the explosive breakout at 2.45 pm today and despite the THREE POINT run up, dropped 75% to .13 before recovering to around breakeven. 'Theta' or 'IV' crush simply doesn't explain the violence of the drop especially with the strength of the rally (which should easily drive contracts up 100% on a normal day). I trade 0dtes every day and have seen nothing like. Does anyone have an idea of what happened?\n\nI also experienced an extreme drop in call option values yesterday when the market suddenly transitioned from trend to a choppy trading range, it was like the contracts evaporated into thin air. I believe MM's have been very aggressively manipulating contract values over the last couple of days, any explanations open.\n\nP.S. not tryna hear 'it's in your head' or 'there's no such thing as manipulation', I have done the maths and been trading for a while and ik something drove those moves.
