My suggestion would be to sell the Oct 18 126C for around $6.00 in premium.\n\nAssignment equates to a 6.8% return over the timeframe of your wheel. I am unsure of the length of time you spent with a short put, but if we assume it was around 30 days, this is an annualized return of about 36%.\n\nIf the stock continues to drop, you can continue to roll down and out as necessary to increase your net premium received. \n\nBest of luck to you.", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "Ditto that.

Do you want the upside? What if you decide on the upside and stock goes to 100? What if you decide on theta and stock goes to 150? Of course you are not the first one to deal with this, but everyone who deals with this first time learns there is no easy answer. It is a game of odds. \n\nOthers have given good suggestions. \n\nI play the theta game with some delta (one open long contract for 5 theta contracts) and here's how I try to optimize it. \n\nYou don't get assigned until your extrinsic drops to 0.2 percent of stock. So nvda is 125, then 0.2% is 25 cents. If the extrinsic is 25 cents why would someone pay that instead of directly trading the market. This does not apply the expiry day and also earnings day but otherwise gives you time to maneuver. You don't need to panic as soon as option goes ITM. You have the opportunity to roll. And imagine if you could get a couple of bucks every weekly roll, you could maybe end up with 150 anyway right :)\n\nI reinvest part of my earnings into moving trades. So let's say I make 1000 bucks from my next roll. I can move one contract by 2 points, basically spend 200 bucks and take the stock closer to money. This helps me gain more theta on future rolls and is a worthwhile cost. However should I do it every time.  No. We start a trade with delta in the 30 range right. So if the delta is still 30, 40, 50, 60, or even 70, the rolls will still provide you as good a value as they did originally. So I would not move my contract unless delta went towards the 60-70 mark. Doing this reduces whipsaws but keeps me moving positions closer to the money for reduced risk of assignment and also higher theta. \n\nIs it perfect? Maybe not. You can still get assigned and price can jump to 150 overnight but over long term you are looking at adjustments you can play over and over across multiple stocks so I am at peace with it as my primary setup is theta not delta.", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "Sell your call around 30 days out at a price you are willing to sell at, then buy a call at a slightly higher strike price.
