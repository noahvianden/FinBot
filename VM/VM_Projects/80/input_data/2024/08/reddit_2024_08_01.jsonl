{"title": "Wayfair shares sink as CEO likens home goods slowdown to 2008 financial crisis ", "selftext": "Online home goods company Wayfair saw sales decline in its fiscal second quarter as its CEO likened the current slowdown in the home goods category to the 2008 financial crisis.\n\n“Our credit card data suggests that the category correction now mirrors the magnitude of the peak to trough decline the home furnishing space experienced during the great financial crisis,” Wayfair CEO Niraj Shah said in a news release. “Customers remain cautious in their spending on the home.”\n\nThe e-tailer fell short of Wall Street’s expectations on both the top and bottom lines. Shares fell 10% in premarket trading Thursday.\n\nHere’s how Wayfair did in its second fiscal quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:\n\nEarnings per share: 47 cents adjusted vs. 49 cents expected\n\nRevenue: $3.12 billion vs. $3.18 billion expected\n\nThe company reported a loss of $42 million, or 34 cents per share, in the three-month period that ended June 30. That’s slightly better than the loss of $46 million, or 41 cents per share, that it posted during the same quarter a year earlier. \n\nSales dropped to $3.12 billion, down about 2% from $3.17 billion a year earlier. The slowdown in sales came even as average order values rose in the quarter from $313 to $307 and after the company opened its first large format store.\n\nFor more than a year, home goods companies like Wayfair have seen sluggish demand for things like new couches and dining sets as the overall housing market turned stagnant against high interest rates. Consumers are buying fewer new homes, which means they have fewer reasons to buy new furniture. Plus, with stubborn inflation, they’ve been more choosy on where they’re spending their discretionary income, and with options like restaurants, new clothes and trips, home goods have not been a priority. \n\nWayfair has needed to entice customers with discounts to bring them in and doesn’t expect to see a resurgence in the category until interest rates are cut and the housing market bounces back. \n\n“We see declines that are similar to the declines that we saw in that 2008 to 2010 period and I think what that speaks to is that the category has been going through just a massive correction, a correction that we’ve previously only seen during a GDP recession,” Wayfair finance chief Kate Gulliver told CNBC in an interview. \n\n“Obviously we’re not technically in a GDP recession as a country right now, and so this is somewhat a unique thing to this category… we’ve seen that kind of recession-like correction in the category over the last few years.” \n\nReprieve could soon be on the way after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said interest rate cuts could come as soon as September as long as economic data continues on its current path.\n\nWayfair, which has implemented a string of mass layoffs to get its cost structure in line with the current size of its business, has struggled to reach profitability, but the quarter was the best for free cash flow generation and adjusted EBITDA in three years, Shah said. \n\nThe company saw adjusted EBITDA of $163 million during the quarter, still below the $168 million that Wall Street had expected, according to StreetAccount. \n\n“We are running the business with the goal of demonstrating substantial growth in profitability this year, even as the top line remains challenging. And that will be our mindset every year going forward as well,” said Shah.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/01/wayfair-w-earnings-q2-2024.html", "id": "1ehgy2n", "created_utc": 1722519620.0, "score": 283, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 90, "comments": [{"body": "They used to be good, now it's just 3rd party resellers listing overpriced item that's available on other websites", "score": 210, "replies": [{"body": "I noticed this when furnishing my apartment post divorce.

In 2007, GDP growth was about 1.9% according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA).\n\nRecent Years (2023): GDP growth has varied in recent years due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent recovery. For example, in 2021, GDP grew by about 5.7%, driven by recovery from the pandemic, but this growth rate has moderated since then, with GDP growth in 2023 estimated to be around 2% to 2.5%.\n\n2007: Wage growth was relatively stagnant before the recession. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), real wage growth was minimal, with nominal wages increasing modestly but often outpaced by inflation.\n\nGDP Growth: The growth rate of GDP in 2007 was lower compared to some recent years, especially during the post-pandemic recovery. However, recent growth rates are beginning to resemble the moderate growth seen in 2007 as the economy stabilizes.\n\nWage Growth: Real wage growth has been more pronounced recently due to labor market pressures, but inflation has also been higher, which complicates direct comparisons. In 2007, wage growth was weaker, with stagnant real wages being a concern leading up to the recession.\n\nRecent Years (2023): Wage growth has been more dynamic in recent years, partly due to labor shortages and inflation pressures. In 2022, nominal wages increased by about 5% on average, though real wage growth (adjusted for inflation) has been mixed. Some quarters saw real wage declines due to high inflation, while other periods showed modest real gains.\n\nDeregulation of the financial industry led to those GOP caused recessions, then we need to either re-instate the regulations they repealed or make new ones, they hurt us more than help us every time they hold the presidency.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Appreciate all the info, but our current numbers and situation are not vastly different to back then.
