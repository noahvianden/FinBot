{"title": "The NASDAQ-100 & Nvidia Earnings ", "selftext": "# [Daily Briefing: Tuesday, Aug 27, 2024](https://sam-weiss.com/daily-briefing-tuesday-august-27-2024/)\n\nBy [Sam Weiss ](https://sam-weiss.com/author/sam-weiss/)/ August 27, 2024 \n\nContinuing where we left off [yesterday](https://sam-weiss.com/daily-briefing-monday-aug-26-2024/), the near-term pull-back that began last Thursday in the NASDAQ-100 (QQQ) is now looking a lot more developed than it was when we ended last week. As we mentioned over the weekend, the typical near-term pull-back after a large $50-$60 move in the NASDAQ-100 (QQQ) lasts between 3-7 trading sessions and roughly 3-4% of downside. With today’s lows of $471.71, the QQQ has pulled back 2.85% or roughly $13 off of its highs. That is a lot more in-line with what we’ve seen during this entire bull market that began in December 2022. I’d say it’s still on the low-side of the spectrum given the large size of the rally, but it’s definitely good enough. \n\nAlso, in terms of duration, the QQQ peaked last Thursday at $485.54 and has been lower ever since. That makes today the fourth session of the pull-back. Again right within that 3-7 day range. The pull-back has been very consistent with the prior trend and we’re getting a lot closer to a bottom. How Nvidia (NVDA) performs on its earnings release will dictate the next move in the QQQ. Make sure to read [Sunday night’s](https://sam-weiss.com/charting-the-course-outlining-the-near-and-intermediate-term-risks-and-potential-headwinds-that-lie-ahead/) post to glean a greater context to the analysis here. \n\nAnother point worth mentioning as to the NASDAQ-100 (QQQ) technical outlook, the QQQ appears to be forming a bit of a bull flag on the hourly which points toward a breakout very soon. Again, the determinative factor on whether that happens will be how Nvidia (NVDA) performs on earnings. If the market is happy with the earnings report and Nvidia goes higher, then the entire market is going higher. It’s setup for that exact outcome and it's telling us the market wants to go higher. Take a look at the QQQ chart. A full bull flag has developed on the hourly over the last four trading days (*image located in the original article*).  \n\nThe NASDAQ-100 is fully set-up to make a breakout move to its all-time highs of $503.50. In fact, if Nvidia (NVDA) pushes higher on its results, that is the first place the NASDAQ-100 is headed. It also means we’re in a full blown let higher in the markets and we can expect the QQQ to run to at least $540-$550 before we see another correction in the markets. This Nvidia (NVDA) report is as important as they come. \n\n# Nvidia (NVDA) Earnings\n\nWe’ve mentioned this before and it bears repeating. Earnings is a near-term phenomenon. I’ve never understood positioning ahead of an earnings report. If you like Nvidia (NVDA) then you should be in the stock straight up and you shouldn’t trade it. There are strategies that you could use to enhance your gains that are near-term in nature. But your core position should be long and hold on a 2-year time-horizon minimum. Anything short of a 2-year time horizon when going long, puts your position at great risk. I’m currently writing up some analysis which will bear that out and it’ll soon be published under Investing Basics at Sam Weiss. \n\nBut the idea here is this. No one should be waiting until the very week before Nvidia (NVDA) delivers its earnings to step in and buy the stock. Really, the only time anyone should be buying is during corrections. That is always the safest, most opportune time to buy for the long-term. The NASDAQ-100 sustains an 8-15% correction every 70-trading days on average; with 100 trading days being the outside extreme. Every time the NASDAQ-100 has sustained a correction this past year, Nvidia (NVDA) has fallen at least 25-30%. That’s when you buy. You don’t wait until Nvidia is trading at $130 share just before it reports earnings to buy. \n\nNow obviously we’ve seen Nvidia (NVDA) make some mind numbing moves after earnings and it could very well rally to $150-$160 or higher after the report. That’s very possible. History has suggested that it may very well happen. \n\nBut if you go in with the mindset of buying ahead of earnings or go in with a trader’s mentality, it’s likely to result in very poor outcomes in the end. I’ll be publishing a post on this very topic sometime this week. It’s a Samwise rule. If you buy on corrections, and hold on a 2-year time horizon, then you’re far more likely to achieve financial wealth and stability than you are trading. \n\n# Where Does Nvidia (NVDA) Go After Earnings?\n\nNow all that being said, here’s our expectation for where Nvidia (NVDA) is likely headed after earnings. Due to the fact that Nvidia just recently sustained a correction with the NASDAQ-100 in July and early August, I do believe it is far more likely that Nvidia trades higher after the results. In fact, I think Nvidia is likely to test its all-time highs very shortly after it reports earnings and it’s probably headed to our $150 price-target a lot sooner than expected. \n\nBack in early August, our expectation was for a 50% Nvidia rally from $90/$100 up to $150 a share by January. But we’ll probably get there a lot sooner than that. The chart below outlines our expectation for Nvidia after earnings. This is what I think is most likely to happen. We’re probably going to see a gap-up, breakout run and then eventual gap-fill on the next correction bringing the stock all the way back to where are today. That’s probably how things develops.  (*Please see original article for the image*).   \n\nThe good news for those long the stock right now is that even if we get a rare negative reaction on earnings (unlikely), I believe it will be short lived and it will make for a huge buying opportunity. Nvidia isn’t going to hang around the $100-$140 trading range forever. It will soon depart that range and move to a higher trading range. Everything points in that direction. The technical outlook, earnings, the economy and the company’s fundamentals all point to higher prices whether we see a pull-back post-earnings or not. For example, suppose we get a sell-off on earnings and Nvida (NVDA) makes a move back down toward the $100 level. The chart is going to look something like this (*Please see original article for the image*).   \n\nAs to forecasting confidence, earnings is always going to be a low-confidence event. Anyone who tells you otherwise is engaged in self-delusion. I used to prepare very detailed earnings analysis for a very long-time and can say with a pretty high degree of confidence that while the numbers themselves can be forecasted with a lot of accuracy, how the market reacts to those numbers is a different thing entirely. While it’s true that Nvidia has delivered one blowout quarter after another, and the market has rewarded the stock for those reports, that trend can end at any moment. You could easy see the market shift toward an expectation for blowout earnings. Apple used to do this very thing for a long-time and the market caught on. Apple would sandbag its EPS guidance by a full 50%, deliver blowout earnings and the stock would skyrocket on the results. Eventually, the market came to expect a 50% blowout on every earnings report and the reactions became more muted over time. \n\nAs Nvidia is now a $3 trillion market cap company, I expect we’re going to start seeing the same thing with Nvidia. I expect the earnings reactions to become a little more muted as move ahead and the gains to be a lot less explosive than what we’ve seen after prior reports. \n\nThat being said, as I’ve already outlined above, Nvidia is likely headed higher after earnings and will give up those gains maybe a month or so down the line. The less likely scenario is for a sell-off post earnings.  But even if that happen, the stock fully recover those losses well before we head into the next earnings report. Those are the two most likely scenarios. \n\nIf Nvidia (NVDA) does go higher as expected, then the NASDAQ-100 (QQQ) breaks to the upside and this will create a positive feedback loop. Nvidia helping the QQQ breakout means the QQQ marches to $503.50 (all-time highs) which in turn puts upside pressure on Nvidia in the coming weeks.

In reality risk is inexorably linked with returns, and you have to be willing to accept the risks in order to obtain the returns. On average, over a lifetime, you can expect your portfolio to drop 50% in value about 3 to 4 times during that period.\n\nTrying to sell at the top, and buy at the bottom is an incredibly hard thing to do. Sure you can look back and point the major turning points and wonder whether you could enter/exit at those points. The reality of it is that, even with years of experience and resilient psychology, it's a loser's game to pick tops and bottoms.\n\nThe main advantage of using an Index ETF is that you can \"hedge\" against your own ignorance of which companies are going to succeed in the next 30 to 50 years (remember Kodak?), and instead you bet on the whole market.

It's great that you're taking the initiative to educate yourself about personal finance at such a young age. While long-term investing in broad market ETFs like those tracking the S&P 500 can be a solid strategy for many investors, it's important to understand that there are nuances and considerations to keep in mind:\n\n1. Diversification: While the S&P 500 offers exposure to 500 large U.S. companies, you may want to consider diversifying further across different asset classes, company sizes, and geographical regions to potentially reduce risk.\n2. Risk tolerance: Your personal risk tolerance may change over time, and it's important to align your investment strategy with your comfort level.\n3. Time horizon: An 18-year time frame is significant, but remember that market performance can be unpredictable in shorter periods.\n4. Consistent contributions: Your example mentions a one-time investment of $15,000, but consistent contributions over time can potentially help smooth out market volatility.\n5. Market timing: While it might seem logical to sell during a crash and buy back in at the lowest point, timing the market accurately is extremely difficult, even for professional investors. Many investors who attempt this strategy end up worse off than if they had stayed invested.\n6. Taxes and fees: These factors can impact your overall returns and should be considered in your investment strategy.\n7. Inflation: The purchasing power of your money may decrease over time due to inflation, which is something to factor into your retirement planning.\n\nRemember, past performance doesn't guarantee future results. The 8-10% average annual return of the S&P 500 is based on historical data and includes periods of both growth and decline.\n\nSome brokerages, like M1, offer tools and resources to help investors create diversified portfolios and implement long-term investing strategies.
