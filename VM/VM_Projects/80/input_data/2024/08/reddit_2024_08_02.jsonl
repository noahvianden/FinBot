A big part is non-stop frustration for decades about Nvidia's extreme control over partners, slowly creeping year over year, and if you don't follow, you get blacklisted. \n\nCompanies like XFX getting kicked out because they dared to work with AMD, EVGA willingly leaving Nvidia's partnership despite being possibly the most well respected and loved official AIB partner for Nvidia in history because of how grueling it is to work with them, with little to no money gains and even less foreseen in the future. As they say, \"Nvidia doesn't forgive, Nvidia doesn't forget.\" Once you're blacklisted, even if Nvidia goes through desperate times, they won't bat an eye towards you, enduring you are made an example for daring to have more than just Nvidia as a key partner when you're a smaller player. More established players have more leverage but smaller companies who did nothing wrong? Better off bankrupt. This is one key point for the recent anti-trust investigations, of them abusing their industry dominance, threatening to cut off or severely limit partners from access to not just Nvidia's services but also others Nvidia has influence over, but such things have been going on for a very long time. Nvidia constantly requiring partners to lower price, cutting in their margins to be unbelievably low (we're talking 2 to 3 percent on  GPUs costing hundreds to even thousands while Nvidia keeps shrinking margins for partners. Imagine making just a few bucks with each sale but Nvidia forces you into a corner so you have no choice) as well as directly compete with their partners by encroaching industries the partners established, then tightening the leash to choke them out. Insisting no deviation of how their GPU chips can be used, resulting in the lack of innovation despite many companies having many great ideas. Word from insiders is that the reason Framework's laptops all went AMD on their GPUs is because nobody dares to engineer such laptops with customization to this degree. Anything slightly creative with Nvidia's extremely strict product guidelines risk lawsuits or straight up excommunicated from them, plus nobody dares to risk another MXM headache.\n\nSpeaking of product guidelines, things like GPU chips or even the chips' specifications only delivered to partners months before release dates for partners to solder into boards, and insist on specific launch dates regardless of what is provided to partners, or else. Promising multiple generations with a new standard, such as MXM, only to cancel it for all partners and have the poor partners have to deal with the consumer aftermath and lawsuits to follow. Once in a while you'll have defective or poorly designed products. It happens to everyone, nothing unusual. Every company tried to shift responsibilities and paying themselves as the best hero there is, once again, nothing unusual.\n\nNvidia however has the worst reputation of admitting to mistakes and getting them to claim responsibility among their competitors, with the default advice being: buy from good brands who partnered with Nvidia, and let the brands' customer service handle your issue for you and eat the costs (RIP EVGA, you will forever be remembered as having the best customer supports team, who would rather die before letting your customers get the short end of the stick). Bought an Nvidia Founder's Edition card? Good luck getting RMA or warranty claims processed in a timely manner, if it even gets processed at all.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "And that's just unintended issues with products. There's a good history of Nvidia shipping products knowing fully well they had issues, then try to address it in firmware to cover it up, then fighting it out in following lawsuits. On top of my mind, other disputes include conflict with Samsung and Qualcomm where Nvidia tried to block Samsung tablets from shipping, failing GPUs sent to partners (and not disclosing it despite being aware) that caused severe problems for Apple, Dell and HP, there's probably more I can't recall. That doesn't even begin to touch questionable marketing, misleading prices that screw over both consumers and board partners, paper launches, extremely closed sourced platforms, and overall a very pushy, controlling and highly aggressive competition strategy that is perfectly fine hurting other businesses as long as they can get away with it. Or if they can't, get into a lawsuit and intentionally flex their war chests so smaller companies die after a decade of court battles, even if everyone knows Nvidia is in the wrong. Their products are good and they pivot to chase trends well. They definitely take advantage of it in any way they can, from gaming to VR to crypto (fun lawsuits about them lying about their earnings here), to pro viz to data centers, to automotive to machine learning, to mobile to streaming services. Each of these had varying degrees of success, some you can say are complete disasters, but what matters is they aggressively take on these new markets, and I do mean aggressively. Once they establish themselves, they charge higher and higher prices while offering less and less, and adopts strategies that strong arm partners and lock out competitors, which really leaves a sour taste in people's mouths, vs wonderful partners you stick with through thick and thin because you both believe each side's doing important work and the world will benefit from. Signing a deal with Nvidia always feels like shaking hands with the devil with how cut throat they are. If anyone gets a bad deal because life is uncertain, Nvidia will make sure it's on you and they make sure the money goes to them. There's also the typical questionable marketing strategies over the years and conflicts/threats towards independent media you'd expect from big corporations.\n\nOverall many enthusiast consumer sentiment from the gaming side is that Nvidia is that of a very anti-consumer and anti-competition one. My personal experience with pro viz is it's alright, just business as usual as the premium is just a business expense. There's not been much alternatives to Nvidia with high end workstations or render farms as cuda superiority heavily locked out many 3d programs from using AMD hardware well on the Windows side, but Apple moved away from Nvidia and embraced OpenCL with AMD, giving creatives that option if they need lower power, think video editing and such. Things have finally changed in recent years (thank you Blender and countless other solutions + optimizations). Can't speak for other sides of Nvidia's business. \n\nRegarding anti-trust, there's also that attempt for Nvidia to acquire Arm from SoftBank a few years back, but that collapsed under regularity pressure (thank god, I cannot imagine a megacorp like Nvidia pretty much controlling the majority of mobile chips' underlying licensing in one go and basically take over the mobile market on the planet). I'm sure there's plenty others but can't remember.\n\nAnother funny thing with Nvidia is their insistence of \"my way or the highway.\" When they bump into another equally stubborn company like Apple, all that happens is a decade of both sides refusing to admit defeat and constantly cutting off the other side by poaching industry players, while always putting the blame on the other side. I actually never followed up on that lawsuit where Nvidia's GPUs were literally falling off of the motherboards they were soldered on in MacBooks, and Apple had to cover costs at their own expense because Nvidia refused to pay them (while paying the other partners that sued). All I know is, years ago I looked it up and both sides were still dragging it out. Dunno if it's been resolved or if they are still at it. They certainly have the cash to go for another decade.\n\nTheir relationship sure hasn't gotten better either, with each side isolating the other at every chance they get. Don't see a partnership between them anytime soon. Both companies are just like that, aggressive, controlling, refusing to take the short end of the stick and refusing to admit they are anything but perfect. The news of Apple announcing they are not using Nvidia chips might have surprised others, but if you know anything about their history, it's the most obvious thing ever.

If they have done nothing wrong and there's no concern, the outcome will only strengthen people's (and various governments') confidence in them. If there is a problem, getting to the problem early prevent things from spilling too far and cause massive crashes/breakups of companies, or from a company truly going too far and be able to leverage their power at your own expense whenever they feel like you have more they can take from you. Finally, external scrutiny can help expose internal corruption, which is always there and never fully goes away, so third party investigations help the company she'd light on how to sustainably continue its mission without deviating from its path due to internal abuse.\n\nPlus in general competition drives innovation. Capitalism works based on mutual growth and lawful, fair competition. Downside is there are very rare but very real positions where one can gain so much power through the system, they actively destroy others to force themselves as the only option, strong arming consumers, governments, partners against their own will even though everyone knows it's a horrible deal, and with that take down the entire system.
