Anecdotally, Costco has much better availability and sales than Sam‚Äôs Club. üöÄ\n\n- **First Membership Hike in 7 Years**: Costco just raised membership fees for the first time in almost a decade. Plus, they‚Äôre enforcing membership scans, locking in more subs and boosting long-term revenue.\n\nCostco is set to crush the 5.2% comp sales growth that Walmart just announced.\n\n**TL;DR: September earnings are coming, and $COST is about to deliver a blowout. With gold, GLP-1 drugs, membership enforcement, and hot dog combos still at $1.50, this stock is ready to take off!** üöÄüí∞\n", "id": "1etdaxr", "created_utc": 1723774381.0, "score": 153, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 85, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 1 | **First Seen In WSB** | 2 years ago\n**Total Comments** | 13 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 13 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 80, "replies": [{"body": "Probably only 2 to 3% I‚Äôve seen lines waiting for them when the stores open", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 23, "replies": [{"body": "I think that's the point - to get you to sign up for an executive membership and credit card.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "This guy knows.

If you had extra cash laying around that you aren't using anyways then you can throw some into gold if you fancy it (certainly is better imo than pokemon cards, jordans, INTC stock, or gucci bags).
