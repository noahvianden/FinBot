Anecdotally, Costco has much better availability and sales than Sam’s Club. 🚀\n\n- **First Membership Hike in 7 Years**: Costco just raised membership fees for the first time in almost a decade. Plus, they’re enforcing membership scans, locking in more subs and boosting long-term revenue.\n\nCostco is set to crush the 5.2% comp sales growth that Walmart just announced.\n\n**TL;DR: September earnings are coming, and $COST is about to deliver a blowout. With gold, GLP-1 drugs, membership enforcement, and hot dog combos still at $1.50, this stock is ready to take off!** 🚀💰\n", "id": "1etdaxr", "created_utc": 1723774381.0, "score": 153, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 85, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 1 | **First Seen In WSB** | 2 years ago\n**Total Comments** | 13 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 13 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 80, "replies": [{"body": "Probably only 2 to 3% I’ve seen lines waiting for them when the stores open", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 23, "replies": [{"body": "I think that's the point - to get you to sign up for an executive membership and credit card.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "This guy knows.
