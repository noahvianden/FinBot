In fact if you open up an Intel based desktop or laptop there's a good chance the majority of the comments could be Intel based. \n\nPlus they do have manufacturing capabilities that AMD does not have and major sponsorship from the US government to bring that production to the US as a strategicly important product manufacturing firm. \n\nThis seems to be prime opportunity for Intel to consolidate to their core business and spin off smaller divisions to generate cash to grow their core business back to profitability. And\nAMD and Intel functioning as essentially a duopoly in the x86 space neither can really go away. \n\nHowever, things are different now than with the recovery of AMD. Chief of which being the rise of ARM and alternatives to the x86 architecture like with Apple silicone. \n\nI keep going back on if INTC is the best value buy opportunity in a while or it really is the hot garbage the recent controversy about their 13th and 14th Gen CPUs failing in mass make it seem to be. \n\nNote, I'm just a casual stocks speculator and PC gaming enthusiast and really should dig into their balance sheets more. \n\n\nEdit: just to be clear, I haven't bought into INTC yet, just testing the waters and getting a gut check before I make any moves. \n\nI feel confident they will recover eventually but, as I mentioned in a comment here, I'm concerned about to what extent and how soon.

Expect a minimum growth rate on the stock of 5%/year plus your dividend. \n\nPurchase a house for $400k, rent it out for $3000-3500/month depending on your area.   The $380k rent income over 10 years will make half the monthly payment of the loan. Pay the other half with your day job.  \n\nAfter 10 years, sell the house.  Expected proceeds $750,000.   Put all of it to loan repayment. This should pay off the balance. \n\nNow it's 2034. You own minimum $815,000 in the stock assuming no splits, more if there were splits or higher growth or dividends.  \n\n  You would have earned $300,000 in dividends.  Assuming amortization of the loan at 20 years, 38% of the loan repayment is made after 10 years leaving about 645,090 left including interest.  \n\nOf the $750k from the house sale, pay off the loan balance early.
