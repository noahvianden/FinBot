{"title": "SVIX: A Theta Gang ETF", "selftext": "This is hands down my new favorite ETF.  It's one of the only inverse ETFs that actually appreciates.  I believe it does so by selling options, most likely CSPs.\n\nThis looks like it could be the type of fund that you can dump a pile of money in after a major crash, forget about it, and come back 5 years later to find 10x gains.\n\nVIX is calculated by using the price of 30+ DTE options on a basket of stocks.  Any VIX related ETFs most likely achieve parity by buying these options.  Options decay, of course, and that's why VIX related ETFs depreciate so fast.  To inverse VIX, I imagine that you would simply sell those options instead of buying them... and I think that's what this fund does.\n\nIt's holdings show as 196% cash and -96% stock.  This makes sense in light of the recent drop.  Before the drop, it's holdings were 100% cash.\n\nThis could be a really good fund if you want theta gains but not be hands on with options.  A hard drop (and boost in VIX) is a good time to enter.  If VIX keeps going up, and the price drops more, doubling down is a no brainer.\n\nI put 10k in when it dropped to 40.  I lost half when it dropped to 20, but threw another 10k at it.  It went back up to 30 in a week, I cashed out that second set of shares, and now I'm 2.5k up and will be 5k up when it gets back to 40.\n\nJust thought I'd share this with you guys...\n\nEdit: To the people of the future, this post was downvoted to oblivion, but I thought I'd add some pertinent information to it in case someone searches for information on SVIX and stumbles upon this post, as you just did...\n\nI assumed that SVIX appreciates by theta from selling options.  I was wrong.  One particular user seemed to have the answer, yet only gave ambiguous and vague hints, acting as if he were doing me a favor for just dropping those crumbs alone.  He also thought it was better to passive aggressively berate me under the mantle of safeguarding the quality of the sub and welfare of its users.  Ironically, providing an actual answer would have immensely increased the quality of this post, and subsequently the sub as well.\n\nHowever, after a brief scroll through his profile, I now understand and sympathize with his motivations.  Edison is famously quoted as saying that success is 10% inspiration and 90% perspiration.  While this user seems to have a fair amount of knowledge about option trading, he unfortunately appears to lack the necessary fortitude, perseverance, and capability to perform it.  He apparently gave up, realizing that he wasn't cut out to play this game, and put most of his money in SPY at the apex of the market. l too would possibly harbor some insidious insecurities that could drive me to use any opportunity to exalt myself over others in attempts to try to ignore and obfuscate my perennial mediocrity and ineptitude.\n\nBut enough of that... Let's get to the answer!  SVIX doesn't appreciate via option theta, but it does appreciate via the force underlying theta... time.\n\nFirst, VIX is usually in a state of contango.  Contango occurs when the price of an instrument's futures are higher than the spot price of the instrument.  The price of those futures decrease and get closer to the spot price as they approach expiration.\n\nSecond, SVIX achieves an inverse relationship with VIX by shorting/selling VIX futures.  Putting both of these together, and assuming that the value of VIX remains unchanged, SVIX sells VIX futures at a higher price, and then buys them back at a lower price as they approach or reach expiration.\n\nAs an example, if VIX is at 15, a future that is a month out might be priced at 16.  SVIX would sell that future for 16, and assuming that VIX doesn't change for the month, buy it back at 15... earning a $1 on the contract and increasing the cash/assets that the fund holds.\n\nOf course, this is a VIX based fund and is extremely vulnerable to spikes in VIX.  SVIX and SVXY both seem to have recovered and achieved new ATHs after major spikes in VIX (e.g. the covid spike), but I would still approach it with caution.  I casually mentioned that an ideal time for entry would be AFTER a major spike in VIX, and this should be emphasized.", "id": "1ev1bu5", "created_utc": 1723957283.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.46, "num_comments": 110, "comments": [{"body": "SVIX and SVXY are shorting VIX futures and attempting to replicate a 30-day VIX future.

The way to really capitalize is to know how option pricing works and build positions that have a high probability of success, based on the conditions.\n\nYes, you're right... SVIX is primarily a volatility instrument.  However, I assumed that it decayed like most of these types of ETFs, and was pleasantly surprised when I realized that it actually appreciates. I thought it was something people would want to know about.\n\nAlso, as a volatility trader, I don't have to tell you... volatility trades are some of the easiest trades on the planet. There aren't many opportunities that you can be reactive instead of proactive. If IV goes up high, then it will most likely come down.  However, not many people know how to set up volatility trades correctly, and trying to sell spreads on things like UVXY isn't that great.\n\nSo, that's why SVIX is attractive to me.
