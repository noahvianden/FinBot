So bonds start to look more attractive at the same time present day value of stocks are dropping and thus the risk free rate of return starts inching closer and closer towards the expected return of an index like the s&p. Stocks are typically riskier, assuming you are able to hold bonds until they expire, so the market demands a premium expected return compared to bonds, when the spread between expected returns of stocks and bonds are close, many investors will choose to allocate capital towards bonds over stocks.
