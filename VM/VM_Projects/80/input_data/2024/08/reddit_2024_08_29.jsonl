Hopefully it‚Äôs lesson well learned (paid). \n\nI enjoy buying options! They‚Äôre gonna be a lot of clowns here that are against option simply cuz they‚Äôre low IQ investors and don‚Äôt know shit except how to regurgitate ‚Äúbuy n hodl‚Äù. At the same time I don‚Äôt recommend options for the beginner or casual investors. They‚Äôre great way to maximize your investments if you‚Äôre a big believer in a company BUT they do assume more risks if you aren‚Äôt careful.\n\nAnyway, my advice‚Ä¶ \n\n1. Never buy options at earnings, ever! Unless you are ok with losing your entire investment as it‚Äôs pure gambling. No one can predict how the market will react to earnings and if someone says they can, they‚Äôre full of shit.\n\n1b. I seen enough earnings where if the entire market believes a stock is gonna perform one way, 8/9 out of 10 it‚Äôs gonna do the opposite. In this case, everyone was betting great earnings, stock will moon, and the market manipulators made sure that didn‚Äôt happen. \n\n2. As you mention, buying options at earning is bad idea due to IV crush. Pre earnings IV rises (more buyers) = higher premiums. Post earnings IV decreases (less buyers) = less value of your contracts. I‚Äôd try to buy options a couple weeks before earnings if possible. \n\n3. Regardless of when you buy options, imho you want to at least get an expiration of 45 days and shoot for 90 days or longer. As Theta (time decay) is an issue when you buy options with a short expiration. \n\n3b. Imho the better investment if you were so inclined to buying options right before earnings would have been a exp date right before or right after the next earnings in NOV. As that gives your calls (or puts) time to recover if you get a repeat of today and the market moves in the opposite direction after earnings comes out. Then pending how your options performs, you can take profits (hopefully) or roll your contracts into a new exp date. \n\nFinally, I don‚Äôt know shit and Im just a chimp like everyone else.  These are some simple rules I try to follow but obvious there are other factors for option trading. Also the bulk of my investments are still in stocks, I have a secondary account to specifically trade options. It‚Äôs more of a play account and I only fund it with bout $15-$20k. If I make money, I move it to my brokerage account and get more shares of whatever (Go ASTS/RKLB!). If I eat a big one, I sulk til I can save up enough to refund the account from my paycheck/savings. Which can take months as I need some guard rails in place where FOMO or revenge trading doesn‚Äôt consume me. \n\nFinally‚Ä¶ As for next week. No one can tell you to sell or wait. If you need the $4k then sell. If your risk tolerance is ok with losing more, then ride it out till wed/thur as I expect a rebound in the stock . However I can‚Äôt tell you if that‚Äôs next week, in a month, 2 months, etc. Good news is a lot of the options for earnings will expire tomorrow and it‚Äôs a new month so hopefully üôè stock will go up sooner as NVDA had great earnings. Again Theta will be working against next week the closer you get to Friday and Monday is a holiday BUT you already went ballz to the wallz, whats a couple more days. ü§£  \n\nGL OP, sorry for long winded post‚Ä¶ Im an old head so I don‚Äôt know how to talk in 280 characters or less‚Ä¶", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "Time decay is a real issue, it starts becoming the overriding factor as expiry gets close, I think it is as non linear correlation.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Earnings are terrible.

{"title": "ASTS Counter-DD (Short-Medium Term)", "selftext": "Posting this here because the \"spacemob\" don't like examining risk\n\nTL;DR ASTS has near-guaranteed upside in the long term, as long as they don't fuck up their technology completely. However, there are huge downsides over the next \\~3 months, and these risks continue to grow every day.\n\nThe upcoming ASTS Bluebird Block 1 launch scheduled for early September is a huge moment for the company to become revenue-generating. But as the date draws closer, we are seeing an increasing number of contraindications for launch, and this has downstream ramifications.\n\nAll of my statements have primary references.\n\n# Today's risks\n\n-[ ASTS Bluebird Block 1 is slated for a Falcon 9 delivery vehicle at Cape Canaveral's Space Force SLC-40 launchpad](https://nextspaceflight.com/launches/details/7143). This is the [same launchpad that Starlink 8-6 took off of](https://nextspaceflight.com/launches/details/7618) and [failed to recover from](https://youtu.be/gCEEYJahjaE?t=4643).\n\nThe [FAA has grounded all Falcon 9's ](https://www.reuters.com/technology/space/spacexs-falcon-9-grounded-after-failing-landing-attempt-2024-08-28/)pending investigation of the recent failure. ASTS is now grounded from the same rocket and same launchpad that they were hoping to earn you money from.\n\nThe last time SpaceX was grounded (a couple months ago), [it took two weeks to be airborne again](https://www.npr.org/2024/08/28/g-s1-19934/faa-spacex-falcon9-grounded-polaris-dawn). Put a pin in this.\n\n[Most rocket failures originate from the launchpad](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20230518-what-are-the-odds-of-a-successful-space-launch). (See also: see Peter Beck's comments from Wild Wild Space documentary)\n\nSpaceX had yet another launch scheduled before ASTS: [Starlink 8-10](https://nextspaceflight.com/launches/details/7499)\n\nSpaceX's quickest turnaround for a launchpad[ is around 3 days](https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2024/07/spacex-q2/#:~:text=In%20April%202024%2C%20SpaceX%20also,1%20and%20USSF%2D62%20missions). That means even before this recent failure, **the earliest possible launch for Bluebird was around 4 September.**\n\nCape Canaveral has notoriously bad weather in September and October.[ Next week calls for thunderstorms every single day](https://weather.com/weather/tenday/l/86161c1d891e1a3363bcb21b857124be6c14f73ca4c2d94bf2501249eb73eec6). Not only that, but the probability of storms has GROWN from 20% this weekend to over 60% every day next week. The [do-not-launch criteria for SpaceX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_commit_criteria) revolves almost entirely around thunder, wind shear, and icing conditions.\n\nASTS is short on time because of their launch slot. SpaceX is planning to use SLC-40 to[ cuck Boeing](https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-decides-to-bring-starliner-spacecraft-back-to-earth-without-crew/). C[rew-9 is scheduled from this same launchpad on September 24](https://nextspaceflight.com/launches/details/6881) -- there is absolutely NO WAY that SpaceX will compromise on this launch, and in all likelihood, they will pay cancelation fees to ASTS in order to ensure Crew-9 goes smoothly. While their record launchpad turnaround time is only three days, I estimate they will take 10 days as a precaution. They've booked nothing past early September. That means that if ASTS cannot launch before September 14-ish, they will get pushed to October\n\nOctober is a horrible launch month in Florida. [The last time ASTS tried to launch in late Autumn, their stock dropped over 50% because of multiple delays](https://spacenews.com/ast-spacemobile-delays-commercial-satellite-debut-by-six-months/).\n\n# Tomorrow's Consequences\n\nFew sources here because much  has been inferred from ASTS's recent earnings call where the CEO spoke at length about their guidance.[ A lot of positivity](https://investors.ast-science.com/quarterly-results) can be drawn from his statements, but the risks are spoken between the lines.\n\nIf this September Block 1 launch is delayed, Bluebird Block 2 will likely be delayed as a result. ASTS has always wanted to test Block1 on an alpha subscriber population in the U.S. Block 2 however is the company's major revenue-generating launch where they intend to scale up for regular consumers over a year or more.\n\nA lot of spacemobbers will tell you that ASTS's runway is long. If the runway is long, I'm here to tell you that it is also extremely narrow, and the past few days are not looking good.\n\n\n\nPositions:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8dlrpg6mlkld1.png?width=728&format=png&auto=webp&s=c4bcca6e95c61bbcae0a7ae7a7555559eea3e3aa\n\n", "id": "1f3xyvz", "created_utc": 1724922989.0, "score": 120, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 127, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 7 | **First Seen In WSB** | 3 months ago\n**Total Comments** | 40 | **Previous Best DD** | [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1f3xyvz/asts_counterdd_shortmedium_term/) \n**Account Age** | 1 year | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "What is this sane rationality?
