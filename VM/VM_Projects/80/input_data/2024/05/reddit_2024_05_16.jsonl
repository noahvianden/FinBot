{"title": "Officially up 100% since I started trading. Thanks theta gang", "selftext": "The straightness of the line is the thing I’m most proud of. 2 years ago I didn’t know what an option was but I really committed to this. Paper traded for a while first and then dove in. I’ve had loads of great advice from the many sage elders of this page.\n\nThe thing I learned is you have to sell volitilty. Interactive brokers has a really good screener to find high IVR and high IVP stocks and ETFs. Nobody has any idea what the stock is gonna do, you just want to put the probabilities in your favour, make lots of trades with appropriate sizing. Options on futures is a must have weapon for any theta gangsters arsenal. You only have to cover variation margin so your gaining a lot of capital efficiency. About than half my gains came from futures. \n\nCash secured puts are a massive waste of money. Too much collateral and not enough theta. Sell naked options and manage regularly. If I sell short a 50DTE put I’ll keep rolling it up if I get a positive move in the underlying. I like to keep my delta at about 0.25-0.3. If I sell short a 50DTE strangle on RTY or ES, I’ll roll in the untested side 4-10 times before I close at that golden 50% gain. Don’t let your delta exceed 0.15.\n\nBuy bonds and Trae using the margin on the bonds. I believe long dated bonds are a buy with inflation coming down so put the majority of my initial investment into 2073 GBP Gilts. I bought at around 34% of the face value as the coupon in 1.125% (YTM is about 3.5%) You can margin 75% of “trusted” government bonds so I can still trade most of it. I expect to sell these in 2-3 years for about double when rates come down.\n\nMost common positions:\n1. Front Ratio spreads through earnings. Don’t be a pussy, none of that butterfly bullshit. Naked options through earnings are how you get hair on your chest. Buy at the expected move and sell a few strikes further out. Sometimes you can open for a credit and close for a credit which gives me a tingle in my balls.\n2. Selling puts on commodity futures during raised IVR and upwards momentum mostly ZW, ZC, CG, SI and HG 45-60DTE and around 0.18-0.25 delta\n3. Strangles on index futures during high IVR mostly ES and RTY, 45-60 DTE and around 0.25 deltas on each wing. I also do this on currency and bond futures.\n4. Debit spreads on TSLA, NVDA, SMCI, COIN, etc. BTD on weekly calls. Buy ITM and sell so it’s a double or nothing play.\n5. I nailed the bottom on the Chinease market. Leaps and shares on BABA and JD. Sold a lot of puts on BIDU but never assigned.\n6. A few long share positions doing well: DE, PYPL, DG, TAN and NLR.\n7. Calendar and diagonal spreads when there is high short term IV. Sell the 5-45DTE and buy the 90-120DTE\n8. A month out from earnings, buy an ATM straddle for the expiration straight after earnings. As the IV builds, it makes the theta you pay cheaper. If the stock picks a direction and runs, you can 2-3x your position. If not close after a week or two for a small loss. I had big wins on TSLA and NVDA doing this.\n9. I like to “retire” money when I get a big win.

Like an insurance. You're taking on risk and you should be rewarded for it.\n\nIf you sell an option with dte 30 days and you earn 30 bucks for it. If the option expire out the money or on the money you got a 100% profit of 30 bucks. Every day pass the 30 days get lower and the time component of option cost less.\n\nremember: option price is base on 1. volatility (risk) 2. time 3. underlying stock price. \n\nIf you sell a low risk stock, volatility and stock price will steady and time decreases as days goes by (30 days to 0 day).\n\nHence the theta strategy. You collect a portion of the time value, money, aka premium as it time passes. So as time passes option get cheaper hence you can close out your position for cheaper. Sold for 30 profit and 14 days later close out for 15 bucks then 30-15 = 15 profit.\n\nOften time as the DTE gets lower it's more risky so people close out around the 15-10 dte window.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "first 100% is on the house, youll eventually realize the house doesnt lose", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Congratulations buddy.
