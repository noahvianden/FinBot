{"title": "Why are investor so bearish? ", "selftext": "To preface this, my vision might be skewed as I live in Canada and the area I live in is currently booming (especially the car and food industry).\n\nEvery week a new business goes up around me, dealerships, garage, napa auto parts, swiftys, even a second napa business opening soon. Restaurant chains and fast food chains are piling up, the mall is always full, walmart & costco are ridiculously overfilled to a point you can barely walk around. Obviously it's a small % of all those businesses but I see no worries in a small city of 65,000.\n\nBut whenever I look at the market, read online or listen to people around it is filled with skepticism and very bearish sentiment. Not only from everyday people but from CEO's of American companies or hedge funds managers. Though I'm not too familiar with him I heard a gentlemen named peter schiff mention he was getting away from us dollar and had 50% of his wealth in Canadian gold stocks and only invested out of the dollar. A lot of hedge funds I keep an eye on seem very bearish, like mhonish pabrai investing in auto repair / auto parts companies and coal (I understand the coal move being more so geopolotical). Other managers like seth klarman, ray dalio, guy spier and other famed investors also hinted towards this same sentiment, though not as extreme.\n\nI also listened closely to Jerome Powell today and I did not hear anything that seemed overly worrying, unless I missed something? And yet the first comments or videos I came across after were about stagflation, recession and a total economic collapse.\n\nSo is it really as bad as what people say ? Why is seemingly everyone so worried ? What am I missing ? If it really is as bad as what people say why is the auto industry or food in expansion mode at such a rapid rate?\n\nAlso if things really are that bad why are all these professional investors still in the market ? If someone has a clear conviction of a economic collapse of some sort, why not wait and buy companies for pennies on the dollar?", "id": "1cimnn7", "created_utc": 1714673795.0, "score": 27, "upvote_ratio": 0.63, "num_comments": 79, "comments": [{"body": ">So is it really as bad as what people say ?\n\nIf most people thought so, stock valuations would be way lower than they are.

For most people the management of their personal portfolios doesn't even scratch a million so the bearishness \"at the top\" is realistic to those people while the bearishness \"at the bottom\" just doesn't matter. What's more likely is that their complaints arise from the higher correlation of everything and a loss of real diversification and hedging ability as the markets simply congeal into \"one thing\".

At that time it meant that, despite the uncertainty, it would be dumb to go short because the Fed clearly wanted to encourage economic growth as part of the recovery. At the moment, the Fed clearly needs to cool the market to tame inflation, but investors continue to pile in. There's a reason the rate cuts keep getting pushed out and, in part, it's likely traceable to the fact that as long as the market is near ATH, upper and upper-middle class folks feel good enough to keep spending. \n\n\nSecond, while valuations are only part of the story, particularly during an inflationary period, there's no denying that they are well above historic averages. That can work out during periods of growth, as profits catch up to the valuation, but see the previous paragraph regarding the outlook for growth.\n\n\nAlso, it's undeniable that the Covid era stimulus goosed the economy tremendously, and people have continued spending above a sustainable level even afterwards (seen through increased household debt, deceased savings). At the same time, the cost of necessities, notably housing, shot up - at some point one can only reason that will reduce consumer discretionary spending, and it's really tough to make that happen in an orderly manner that doesn't tank the economy.\n\n\nGlobal political instability also probably contribute to people feeling less optimistic. So far, the effects of war in Ukraine and Israel have been remarkably contained economically. It doesn't take much imagination to come up with scenarios where oil goes sky high. That's to say nothing of the possibility of China's economic woes spreading.\n\n\nFinally, many people on Reddit work in tech, which has been a major driver of the gains we've seen over the past decade. At the moment, even though several tech stocks are booming, it's rough for employees in those companies - and people, rightly or wrongly, assume that extends to the rest of the economy. There may also be some portion that reflects skepticism that AI will become the giant driver of growth required to justify valuations of some companies. Also, governments are clearly taking increased interest in regulating tech (e.g. US anti-trust cases and DMA in Europe).
