I think In their minds, they still believe this is just a hype train powered  by a slightly better chatbot.\n\nBut that is not why Google, Microsoft, Apple, Meta, and major governmental bodies are investing in artificial intelligence.\n\nScalable, contextualizable, and easily deployable intelligence is a completely new and different paradigm for our society. And whether you describe the outputs of this technology as being the result of effective reasoning or not is an irrelevant (in the context of the market) philosophical position, in my opinion.\n\nThis intelligence has demonstrated the ability to be directed toward specific tasks, and it is able to solve those tasks better than the average human.\n\nAnd to be frank, the average human generally performs far below their actual potential.  So, an intelligence that doesn't require breaks, and whose outputs are comparable / better than the average person is a fundamental sea change for our species.\n\nI honestly feel bad for people like this, because not only are they going to lose a lot of money on these trades, but they are going to be blindsided by the inevitable societal changes that will result from this technology.\n\nOn one hand, I am making decent money from their ignorance.  But on the other hand, as a fellow person, I want them to be able to take advantage of these technologies and to not be inadvertently harmed because of their misunderstandings.\n\nReally bears, it is time to do some real research and DD, for your own good.", "score": -4, "replies": [{"body": "“Im ok with progression towards dystopia as long as i can make money off of it”", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Who gives a shit how you feel about it?
