Back in 2022 COIN was around 40-60 $ a share and for whatever reason extremely out of the money calls still had huge premiums. Well, crypto at that time was in the shitter,  interest rates that were introduced in late 2021 made most tech companies fall extremely in share price, recession looked likely and the Russia Ukraine conflict made the market fall by a lot. In short the whole market looked like shit, especially the tech market.\n\nI looked at it and thought \"under this conditions, there is no way COIN will rally 20-40% in a matter of weeks. No fucking shot\".\n\nso I sold calls that were up to 40% out of the money and had  only 2-3 weeks till expiration. Again, nooo fucking way COIN would rally 40% or whatever in this market in like 2 weeks.\n\nFast forward a couple of weeks, I'm sitting in a restaurant and pull up my broker and COIN is going through the roof. +20% intra day. My short calls are now in deep red. I'm now several thousand in the red. I start sweating and closed some calls but not all. -12k or something. OK, that's bad but surely COIN won't go up further. I still had like 4 or 6 short calls open that were still like 20% out of the money.\n\nA day or so later COIN is up 40% pre market, my broker send me a margin call warning. This was pre open so I couldn't even close my position. COIN climbed to over 110$ a share. I'm in fucking panic mode. My short calls are in the money and I'm -35k on those calls. The market opens and COIN keeps climbing. I managed to close my calls probably minutes before my broker would have margin called me and liquidated my entire account.\n\nTurns out COIN announced their partnership with Blackrock and their Spot ETF. That's was the reason the premiums were so high to begin with. Insiders knew thus the premiums for calls looked extremely attractive. had I not closed some calls the day before in the restaurant I would have been margin called and likely would have lost 60k or more.\n\nHere is a lesson: if premiums are high and look like a no brainier, it's because the probability of them going in the money is higher than you think. Oherwise the premium wouldn't be that high.  There is no free lunch. If the premiums are high, the risk is high.\n\nnow the part the hurt the most.

Sure.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "It's not a pump and dump, but it is cyclical. Analogize it to the video card industry. At one point, essentially everyone had integrated graphics. The 3d gaming card boom was ATI/3DFX/NVDA selling add in cards. Eventually, though, most major systems started integrating those cards into their systems - margins compressed and the product became slightly more commoditized. Don't forget, NVDA almost went bankrupt. Twice.\n\nI'm rambling, but the point is that just like 3d video cards, once you have one, you don't upgrade every cycle (unless you have $ to burn or are a hardcore gamer). The more reasonable thing to do is upgrade every other or even 3rd cycle.\n\nThe same will happen with AI chips. Does anyone really think META is going to drop $40 billion every year on every new NVDA release? That's just silly. Once they have AI hardware fully deployed, they will upgrade in phases, swapping out their oldest cards for newer ones, and repeat that cycle every year. Hence the cyclicality. This has always been the way with semis.\n\nWhat is happening now is the equivalent of everyone upgrading their shitty integrated graphics (classic data centers) to 3d graphics (AI cards).

Some of the orders are mind boggling Ex: META buying 350,000 *Nvidia* H100 GPUs.\n\nAfter the big players/sovereigns' orders are filled, we will likely see the 2nd place players start to get theirs - also potentially at a discount compared to early adopters. These smaller players have no real choice but at least they get to see how early adopters best implement the GPUs to make/save $.\n\nThe reality is very few companies (other than NVDA and system builders) are actually making $ off of AI right now. I still believe that the true use cases are yet to be realized.\n\nAgain, I'm rambling but compare it to the cell phone.

At current potential, Nvidia is worth 5-6x its peers on P/S and 2x on P/E.\n\nGiven its monopoly position, margins are indeed prohibitive, but first, AI datacenter expansion is being done by only a few dozen companies globally and there are no plans to expand the list due to the high entry threshold, and second, large capital expenditures are highly cyclical and such a frenzy will not happen in 2-3 years.\n\nNvidia no longer has the \"key to success\" as all other business segments (Gaming and AI PC, Professional Visualization, Automotive and Robotics) are literally insignificant on the scale of current results, generating about $12-14 billion in revenue per year with a declining trend. These segments will generate $15.1 billion in 2020, $15.5 billion in 2021, $11.5 billion in 2022, $13.1 billion in 2023, and the potential for up to $13 billion in 2024. Prospects - None, all the potential is in data centers only.\n\nIt is impossible to extrapolate the current growth rates of Nvidia's financial indicators - the results are already close to the limit, given the hype, and in 2-3 years the results will begin to decline, and the margin will shrink, because competitors - primarily AMD - can come to the profitable place. Google, Amazon and Intel are also trying to enter the market.\n\nAll of Nvidia's dominance is due solely to data centers, i.e. almost 90% of revenue is now generated in this segment. In 8 years, revenue has grown by two orders of magnitude (100x) in supplying data centers under AI.\n\nEven if Nvidia achieves potential results, the current capitalization is already 2.5x the market. Even in the most favorable scenario, buyers of nVidia at 2.6 trillion capitalization already have no realistic upside (suicidal and crazy), but have unlimited downside in the long run.\n\nThere is no doubt that Nvidia will repeat Cisco's 1999-2001 pattern (see the historical chart).
