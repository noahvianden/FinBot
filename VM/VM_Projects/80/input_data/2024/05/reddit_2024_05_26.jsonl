{"title": "Apple should not create its own Generative AI", "selftext": "2000s there were so many search engines but who won: Google. Why did they win they secured a deal to make Google a default on Apple devices. Apple didn’t spend building and marketing their search engine, they instead made billions from the real estate in everyone’s pockets. I think they should repeat this, it takes  tens of thousands of Nvidia H100s plus Datacenters, years, data, thousands of engineers and megawatts of electricity to make their own. why not just make the AI companies compete for the Real Estate. The Nvidia H100s are gonna be depreciating asset as more advanced chips such as Blackwell or other competitors replace them.

They let the market figure things out, just like they did with apps, and just like they did with the iPhone, and then buy the very best and let the others duke it out.\n\nWhat Apple is doing with AI is exactly what Apple has done with every other technology wave. They’re not going to miss it. They’re just going to come out with the absolutely most kick ass version of it that everybody wants years after investors and entrepreneurs have done all the work and let everybody else make all the mistakes first.\n\nSop.", "score": 116, "replies": [{"body": "I’ve been working with the Apple ecosystem professionally since 2008, not only did I build my career as a iOS engineer I also have quite a few friends working at Apple.\n\nI have to say I completely disagree with your take here. Apple’s strategy rarely worked outside of the hardware domain, in which they had/have some of the best talent in the world in terms of engineering,  design, manufacturing, supply chain, etc.\n\nBut when it comes to service software, Apple doesn’t have such advantage. Apple Maps and Siri do not live up to the standard of their hardware. Apple TV is decent but it’s got no tech advantage over any of the other streaming services.\n\nNow when it comes to AI, follow the talent. The best and brightest are going to a few top companies in the world right now but Apple isn’t one of those destinations. It’s a field that requires just as much compute as it requires human talent.\n\nFor example Apple succeeded in the SoC product line because it managed to get some of the best talent in the world through [acquisitions](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/28/technology/28apple.html#:~:text=Apple%20wants%20the%20fastest%20chip,often%20found%20in%20mobile%20devices. ) and aggressive hiring. But unless Apple buys Mistral (unlikely) or OpenAI (almost impossible), it won’t have the talent war chest required to fight this campaign.\n\nBtw not only did I work for 15 years in the valley, a close family member of mine recently got a ML/AI PhD from a top university/advisor and the offers he’s been getting almost makes *me* jealous lol.", "score": 55, "replies": [{"body": "I helped launched the iPhone and am a former Apple senior engineer myself.

Apple was able to buy Intrinsity for a fraction of the value of what AI startups are worth today.\n\nDoes Apple have a huge cash reserve? Yes it does, but making huge acquisitions has never been its modus operandi. What’s the largest acquisition Apple has ever done? It's barely $3B when they bought Beats. \n\nBy comparison Anthropic is valued at $20B, and OpenAI is valued at $100B. Apple has never made purchases close to that size.\n\nWhich is why I don’t think Apple’s traditional playbook applies in the software world today.\n\nThen there is the culture differences of building software vs. building hardware. Apple Maps and Siri are prime examples of Apple's software game being significantly behind their hardware game. \n\nBut again, it would be great if you can share some insights too. I’m sure you have valuable perspectives.", "score": 10, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Apple has been doing ML, these days called AI, for a decade and a half.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": ">Apple has been doing ML, these days called AI, for a decade and a half.\n\nAI has existed for a lot longer than a decade and half, but that doesn't matter.\n\nThe current hype is the result of the successful application of transformers, a concept introduced by the landmark paper Attention is All You Need. \n\nAlmost everyone has been caught off-guard by the quick and successful implementation of applications using transformers (LLM being the prime example), including Google (where the paper came from), and of course Apple is completely behind in this area.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "https://machinelearning.apple.com/research", "score": -2, "replies": [{"body": "You listed me a couple hundred papers.
