{"title": "Experienced Options Traders, hold out or sell NVDA Calls?", "selftext": "Hey guys! Newer to options trading. I decided last week, to drop about 7.8k on 15 NVDA $1200 6/14 calls, for $4.90 per. Come today, watched it roller coaster up and down. As of close of market today, 5/28, they hit a price of $34.52 per, which wouldput the trade at 44+k gain. If this was your trade, would you sell immediately, or ride it until after the split? Looking for honest opinions. And just that OPINIONS 😁 I'll also take constructive criticism, as I'm fairly new and could probably use it.", "id": "1d337ua", "created_utc": 1716955166.0, "score": 39, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 83, "comments": [{"body": "Take it and run, homie.", "score": 104, "replies": [{"body": "You may see a little more upside but why turn a winner into a loser?", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "Exactly.
