There should be a marketing strategy to educate potential customers about home charging options, Superchargers, and anything else that makes a Tesla a viable *and better* alternative to an ICE car.\n\n  \n1:43 Superchargers\n\n>they're running at 99.9 uptime 99.9% is uptime what what do you need an R&D and a new product development team for these are as good as you're ever going to get sooner or later you reach a point where you know what nothing you do is going to make it an improvement and that's where they are with the Tesla charging system\n\nIf that was truly the case, V4 Superchargers would be starting mass deployment, and V3 would have totally displaced V2 by now.  The Tesla DC fast charging system is nowhere near done in terms of deployments or upgrades.  And I haven't even gotten to the necessity for Megachargers that will eventually be needed to support Tesla Semis and other heavy vehicles. \n\n\n\n2:10 Employee layoffs\n\n>so if you're an engineer and the project comes to an end you find a new job if you're in sales and marketing and they don't need that anymore you go and find a new job that's just the way it\n\nTesla has been firing engineers and other team members before projects have come to an end.  Initial 10% reduction in headcount and as high as 20% has been for all teams, including AI and FSD related.  \n\n  \n3:38 \"Elon Said\"\n\n>Elon said he'll be building more stations I don't need engineers and I don't need marketing people if all I'm going to do is pick up things that are being manufactured he didn't say\n\nElon also said Tesla Semis would be in volume production this year at a 50k/year rate, that Tesla would build a Gigafactory in Mexico, and that Tesla would produce a much more affordable EV on the unboxed process (now changed to a derivative of Model 3 or Model Y).  Elon could very well change his mind on a dime, like he did with Gigafactory Mexico.  His credibility is very thin right now.  \n\n  \n4:31 Fiduciary Duty\n\n>it's the right thing to do he's the CEO or president or whatever title he's got that means that he has a fiduciary duty to the people who put their money and good faith into the company a fiduciary duty what does that mean that means that\n\nMunro has a lot of nerve bringing this up, given that Elon Musk has been totally derelict in his fiduciary duties towards Tesla shareholders over the past 2 years.  On page 580 of Walter Isaacson's biography of Musk, Isaacson recounts a Tesla board meeting where Tesla's board confronted Musk about his behavior on Twitter and the negative effects on Tesla's sales.  Musk's behavior has been a clear breach of fiduciary duty owed to Tesla.  On page 586 of the same book, Isaacson was spending Christmas vacation with Elon Musk and Kimbal Musk's house.  Kimbal, also a Tesla board member, asked Elon Musk to consider resigning as CEO of Tesla, because Elon was almost totally checked out of Tesla by that point. \n\nElon Musk has effectively been an absentee CEO for 2 years now.  If Munro thinks that violation of fiduciary duty should land someone behind bars, Musk should be in jail. \n\n\n\nMunro claims that he's talking about business and leaving \"emotion\" out of it.  Either he's delusional or trying to gaslight his audience.  His rants aren't based on fact, and they're mostly nonsensical statements made out of loyalty to Elon Musk, nothing more.
