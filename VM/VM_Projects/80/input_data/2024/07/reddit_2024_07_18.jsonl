But...for all the people freaking out, calm down.\n\nA stock that just keeps going up with nothing changing, without fundamentals changing or without any real substantive news, THAT is a bubble.\n\n  \nThis is a stock that goes up on earnings and forward guidance. Their next earnings report, if they hit 30B, 150. If somehow they hit 32B...then you could see 160 or higher. Focus on that and don't get too caught up in your emotions of the daily minutia.\n\n  \nGo look at NVDA stock. Then look at the 5 year picture. Look at where it's gone and where it is. This dip? Nothing. Sucks if you bought at 135 or 140, but you haven't lost anything...unless you sell. \n\n  \nNot meant to sound like a pep talk just...some perspective I guess or...whatever.

But a good starting point isn't making a lazy argument, not doing any investigating for yourself so you can see Cisco had a Forward PE of \\~200 and as high as just shy of 700 whereas NVDA has a bit of a high PE, but with it's growth, being in the tech sector, it's to be expected. \n\n  \nThese can be very good sub-Reddit's for information...but you need to sift though the bullshit(the 50T market cap in 10 years) and try and find your own reasonable expectations.", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "Nvda was on a very good roll, post split not so much .
