AWS (Amazon Web Services) is the backbone for many companies. Look at Netflix: it would take them 3+ years to transition out of using AWS, so they probably won’t do that. Amazon can up their charges to these companies, much like how Apple can within the App Store. And the bigger these companies get, the more money Amazon makes.\n\nAmazon is a diversified company. When I buy an Amazon share, I am buying a technology, entertainment, and retail business. So to see it as one uniform business doesn’t make much sense.\n\nThey are investing so much into AI infrastructure that they could potentially be one of the most benefited companies from AI. \n\nTheir PE ratio instills doubt into a lot of investors; on paper it looks like an expensive company currently. However, the reason why that is, is because they underreport earnings. They reinvest so much into their business, and this expense hurts net income, thus high PE. However, they will gradually report more and more net income and the E in PE will look a lot better. Now is the time to buy, when investors are discouraged by the high PE.

This is why employees are told at each compensation review that any RSUs granted are subject to board approval.\n\nAnd this is not necessarily a bad thing for shareholders: doing this allows Amazon to attract employees with 10s or hundreds of thousands (sometimes millions) of dollars of compensation without having to come up with the cash for it.
