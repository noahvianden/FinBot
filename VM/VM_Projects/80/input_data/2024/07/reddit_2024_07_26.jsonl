The stock's current price of $1690 is significantly above both the short strike ($1555) and long strike ($1500) of the spread, providing a comfortable cushion. The bullish trend, positive sentiment (0.43 overall), and recent price performance (9.23% latest change) all support the trade's potential success.\nHowever, there are several key points to consider:\n7. Fundamentals: While the company has negative EPS and income, its high gross margin (77.12%) and projected EPS growth (48.25% next year) are positive signs.\n8. Market Sentiment: Both Reddit and StockTwits sentiment are positive, aligning with the bullish outlook.\n9. Volatility: With an ATR of 120.60 and recent price swings evident in the candle data, the stock exhibits high volatility, which could work for or against the trade.\n10. Bitcoin Correlation: As a Bitcoin-related stock, MSTR's performance may be influenced by cryptocurrency market trends, adding an extra layer of complexity.\nThe trader should be prepared for potential rapid price movements, especially around earnings. The high probability of profit (71.6%) is encouraging, but the negative expected value (-$10.48) suggests caution. The return on risk (10.3%) is attractive for a short-term trade, but the trader must weigh this against the elevated risk due to earnings and the short time until expiration. Monitoring Bitcoin's performance and overall market sentiment towards cryptocurrency-related stocks will be crucial for managing this position.\n\nAnother one\n\n\nThe bearish call credit spread on GME with short strike at $28.5 and long strike at $30.0, expiring on 2024-08-02, appears to have a relatively high probability of success, warranting a confidence score of 25 out of 30. This assessment is based on several key factors:\n7. Time Decay: With only 138 hours until expiration, theta decay will work in favor of this credit spread, increasing the likelihood of success.\n8. Probability of Profit: The stated POP of 96.9% is very high, supporting the confidence in this trade.\nHowever, traders should be cautious of potential risks:\nIn conclusion, while the trade shows a high probability of success, the trader should remain vigilant due to GME's history of volatility and its status as a meme stock. Setting appropriate stop-loss orders and being prepared to manage the position actively could be crucial for risk management.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Haha I need you in my life üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ thank you", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "That looks really cool, will have to check it out!", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Hi OP,\nDidn't want to DM you and be weird, but is the site down?
