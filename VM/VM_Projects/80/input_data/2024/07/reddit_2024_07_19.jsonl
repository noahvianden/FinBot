{"title": "I deserve flair, I am a regard - savings lost 3 years ago and still going\n", "selftext": "Hey degenerates,\n\nI've been lurking in the shadows of WSB for a while now, and I think it's high time I share my legendary saga of regardation. Buckle up, because this ride is bumpier than a penny stock chart.\n\nThree years ago, I threw all my savings into the stock market with the confidence of a drunken gambler at a roulette table. Spoiler alert: Lady Luck was not on my side. Today, I'm still deep in the red, with no sign of recovery, and I'm here to claim my rightful flair.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\nChased every meme stock like a dog chasing its tail.\n\nPanic sold at the bottom like a true paper-handed coward.\n\nBought high, sold low - a strategy no one but a regard would follow.\n\nBought an effing 20x factor on ArcelorMittal and obliterated my savings lol.\n\nMy portfolio is a graveyard of bad decisions, and I'm proudly sharing the screenshots to prove my utter incompetence. Every dip was a buying opportunity, and every peak was a selling trigger ‚Äì because why not lose money faster?\n\nBut you know what? I'm still here, doubling down on dumb decisions and loving every minute of it. This is the essence of WSB spirit, right? YOLO, all day, every day!\n\nI have been saving up money these last 3 years and went all in on tech yesterday and today because why not.\n\nSo, fellow regards, give me my flair. And to all the aspiring regards out there, remember: I'm your cautionary tale and your inspiration.\n\ntldr: i am regard, giv flair\n\n[proof of regardation](https://preview.redd.it/ggup55q66jdd1.jpg?width=3031&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6238ec8be3c6e478c54afb96106b485102df9bad)\n\n", "id": "1e7ctx4", "created_utc": 1721418964.0, "score": 49, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 86, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 1 | **First Seen In WSB** | 3 years ago\n**Total Comments** | 6 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 5 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I think an excellent flair would be ‚ÄúI deserve flair‚Äù", "score": 45, "replies": [{"body": "Definitely better than some of the other low effort flair mods award..", "score": 10, "replies": []}, {"body": "I am a desperate regard, I will take anything at this point", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "https://preview.redd.it/uzb26bqmfjdd1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=06b41a55b0d7621f3229ecda94abb6b2d45cda4d\n\nOh fuck you", "score": 42, "replies": [{"body": "https://preview.redd.it/6jkziab7wjdd1.jpeg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=947955c660965d6026a6abc9a671873f16683f3f", "score": 43, "replies": [{"body": "House is shaking from my laughter", "score": 17, "replies": []}, {"body": "ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£", "score": 7, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "This is so brutal ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Thats one of the most brutal robinhood screens I've seen on here.
