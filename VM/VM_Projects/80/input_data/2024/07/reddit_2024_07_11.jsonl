Historical performance has been poor, they IPO'd way over valued to raise funds, but what they're doing is expensive. It's no news that they're hemorrhaging money, citing a loss of $40,000 per vehicle sold (down from $67,000 last year). But in the last 3 months they've had some very promising announcements.\n\nDuring the recent investor day webinar they talked about how Gen 1 was all about proof of concept, but now they're moving onto Gen 2 which is about manufacturing efficiency. They detailed how they reduced components, steps and fasteners to decrease production and assembly costs. It all sounds very good. In addition they just entered a deal with VW for $5 Billion and all Rivian is supplying to VW is software. It's a stepped plan, $1B up front and additional investments based on performance.\n\nIf they reduce manufacturing costs as they predict, and lower sale price as they promised, I'm thinking this stock could be ripe for big growth. They're the only company competing directly with Tesla, and on the consumer side, it's going well. I doubt we'll ever see a RIVN selling at comparable prices to TSLA, but I could see them over $100 in a few years if they continue to make advancements.\n\nThoughts?\n\nI'm in at $11/share.", "id": "1e0ds09", "created_utc": 1720664028.0, "score": 52, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 99, "comments": [{"body": "Welcome to r/stocks!\n\nFor beginner advice, brokerage info, book recommendations, even advanced topics and more, please read our [Wiki here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index)\n\nIf you're wondering **why a stock moved** a certain way, check out [Finviz](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=spy) which aggregates the most news for almost every stock, but also see [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/), and even [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/).\n\nPlease direct all simple questions towards the stickied Daily Discussion and Quarterly Rate My Portfolio threads (sort by Hot, they're at the top).\n\nAlso include *some* [due diligence](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/duediligence.asp) to this post or it may be removed if it's low effort.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Granted they have revised their manufacturing line but they reported nearly forty thousand loss per vehicle on a cost of goods versus what it sells for.  Then to add insult to injury for the quarter they spent nine hundred fifty seven million dollars between research and SG&A!  How!  On the next page down you can see they had around eight billion in cash and short term investments. The VW deal is about a billion up front but its not like the other four billion goes to Rivian's bottom line.  \n\nSo with that eight billion dollars of cash they have to not only make it to the R2 launch in the first half of 2026 they have to fund it as well. I don't see how without another cash raise and a large one at that. Their next two quarterly reports are going to be very interesting. \n\nSummary, they have to not only break even on COGS versus Revenues which they were down forty thousand a unit but they need to start earning sufficient profit to reduce the near billion a quarter they are spending to run the place.  They need to sell magnitudes more vehicles than they have ever sold.  Just the SG&A portion being five hundred million dollars requires over thirty thousand in profit per unit sold if they achieve fifteen thousand units per quarter.
