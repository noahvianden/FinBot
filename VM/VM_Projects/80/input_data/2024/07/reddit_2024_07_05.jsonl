{"title": "5 criteria to spot the next Nvidia ! And How much 10,000 invested at its IPO is now worth ?", "selftext": "Hi everyone ! \n\nI am new to this community and i would like to share with my discoveries after having analyzed different winners like Nvidia , tesla, monster beverages , Microsoft, Elf Beauty or Cisco in the 90s . I have studied all these monster stocks and tried to see what do they have in common ! Catching one stock like Nvidia can change your life financially forever ! Nvidia stock appreciated at rate of 38,11% annually since 1999 and is one of the most successful stocks of all time .  I hope my post will be appreciated by everyone because I want to improve everyone's knowledges here. \n\nIt's a nice mix of fundamental and technical analysis! Like that i,t would not be pure luck to make it big at the stock market! \n\n\n\nFirst Criteria : Positive Revenue Growth (minimum 20% annual growth for the last 3 year)\n\n\n\nRevenue is the first and most important criteria because without revenue, no income . It's mean no business.Nvidia Revenue went from 150 million to almost 61 Billion in 2024 . That's a rise of 38500% or 27% annually since 1999 ! Other monster stocks like Tesla, Monster ,Microsoft or Cisco shared these kind of revenue growth when they were exploding ! It's logical because companies with fast revenue growth should expect future rapid stock growth ! \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8lgl99v2vkad1.png?width=622&format=png&auto=webp&s=681589668c8708dcd442f1758d9c5fdb00c99af7\n\n\n\nSecond Criteria : EPS Growth (minimum 20% growth the last 3 years)\n\n  \nA positive EPS growth is also important ! Earnings per share (EPS) is a measure of a company's profitability that indicates how much profit each outstanding share of common stock has earned. Without profits it will be harder for a company to invest in itself to improve itself from competition ! The majority of explosive stocks that I mentioned earlier got positive EPS growth . The only exception is Tesla that got its first positive EPS in 2020. Sometime a stock can rise with negative EPS because investors expects the company will one day be profitable !  It worked with Tesla and with some other. Sometime, you could hit the jackpot with this kind of stock, but it's preferable to invest in profitable stocks. \n\nHere are the data for Nvidia ! I don't have data before 2012, but you can see it was mainly positive from 2012 to 2024. NVidia EPS went from $0,26 in 2014 to 13,12 currently ! that a compound growth rate of 48% for the last 10 years . The EPS was multiply by 50 .  The stock went from $0,3 early in 2014 to $128 currently !  Not coincidence !\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7e74ublbzkad1.jpg?width=1362&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=78151a21e5bce954cf58d5b9d703d7154c5c4095\n\n  \nThird Criteria : The rising expenses in Research and development (competitive advantage ) \n\nThis one is very underrated , but is very important . This expenses are strategically done to improve the company's products and to find a way to distinguish them from the competition ! This expense are also done to better understands their customers and to create better products for them . It's a MAJOR way to gain an ADVANTAGE  on the competition at IT'S ALSO A WAY TO DETERMINE HOW MANAGEMENT BELIEVE  IN THE COMPANY !  If the management believe in their company, they will invest in it . By doing this well, you can be a successful ! Nvidia  did this successfully with years ! Here are the chart ! The company multiplied its expenses by almost 8 since the last 10 year and the rest is history ! That's a annual rise of 23% in this section! The other companies I have mentioned share this too !\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g7tqclvi1lad1.jpg?width=728&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e35fc07944bce9a4af69848560b1bce568fc5a87\n\n\n\nNumber 4 : The management \n\nThere are no quantitative way to measure this one but is very important for the long term investor ! The CEO and the management need to be transparent , ambitious and competent in their field ! Mr.  Jensen Huang has proven he has all these qualities since he co founded the company in 1993 ! The only way for me to find a quick way to evaluate management is to see a positive growth in Research and Development to see if the management believe in the company !\n\n\n\nThe number 5 : 52 week high ( Momentum and technical analysis)\n\nThis one is very different from the 4 others because this one is the chart analysis but it's very easy ! We are looking for positive price momentum for a potential future rise . The 52 week high method has proven to be successful with time because many successful investors and traders use this since the dawn of time . 52 WEEK is a new high in the YEAR ! In theory, if a company make a new high in a year, it's a positive momentum sign. You can invest in the best company possible ,but if you do it at the wrong price or the wrong moment , you can lose your hard earned capital ! This is why price momentum come here and is unfortunately very underrated ! Here we go with some examples of a yearly chart of Nvidia! For example, let's say you did your homework by studying NVidia and saw a new high in 2013 of $0,4 . you buy and decide to ride the wave with time and add to the position when the stock makes new 52 week high.  You will be rewarded\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uay2auw94lad1.jpg?width=647&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6b4b5197e37f194c9435c668620349653631097b\n\nHere's the chart of the company from 1999 to today \n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b3xhjmz75lad1.jpg?width=1026&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0d5ffa41b139e24c242ed696b11f41853f5c1855\n\nThe stock went from $0,4 to $128 today ! That's a rise of 32,000% in just ten year . It would have turned 10,000 into $3,2 million. The 52 week chart helps us to see the long term trend and to ride with it . Have you also added tot the position each time the stock makes a new high , you could have made money too ! The beauty of this method is there's no need to catch bottoms. You just ride with the trend ! You should also have a good stop loss to protect your capital if you're wrong . Some people have a stop loss of 10% of the share price. Other it's 5 or 6% . This one is up to you ! I will do a future post about my investment strategy ! \n\n  \nSome more examples of the 52 high strategy (Yearly chart)\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uctuj0lwflad1.jpg?width=1212&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=05296b00daf111f43b7df85bfed577816e6b7b0a\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iv7zxztyflad1.jpg?width=1146&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bb6c00ba19af5561c084ca92ac6520a00d7a8278\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8v8n5xjzflad1.jpg?width=782&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6c3b3861d3862887619555ac425fb1887c1e28a0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yxztrp6aglad1.jpg?width=782&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4c3dc231e26fc0c1bbe3a0aca9f60b80588ff083\n\nAll these monsters stocks surged like that too and the 52 week strategy applied to them could have make you wealthy. Like that, you could invest strategically in monsters stock thanks to a mix of technical and fundamental analysis. It will not be just pure luck to be successful at the stock market ! Sure it's not a 100% win  rate strategy ,but you can make it big with a good money management.\n\n\n\n  \nNow how much is the an original investment of $10,000 would be worth today ! \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yyqc97pc6lad1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bf62afc9541188bdae5dfd3e392cfe0e88d1b08b\n\n  \nIt's not a mistake . With adjusted prices and with stock splitting included , the stock has adjusted price at its IPO of $0,04 ! Today the stock is trading at $128 . 128/0.04 = 3200.  10,000\\* 3200 = $32 million \n\n\n\nYes you cannot go back in time and invest in it , but i shared with you some discoveries about future potential Nvidia that could change your financial life ! Thanks to the 52 week high strategy, you could have well surfed the trend of Nvidia with years and could have built a huge capital with time ! Don't forget that there's actually a future Nvidia in the making! You missed this opportunity, then another one will arrive.😊 It's life!\n\n  \nI hope that this post was positive and helpful to guide you to find the next NVidia !I have worked for hours to make it !\n\n  \nPlease be respectful !
