Although smaller AI data center vendors in China can offer the H100 GPU for rental, the larger hyperscalers are opting to buy the H20, adhering to the regulatory requirements.\nBased on their field trip takeaways, analysts said the single-chip performance of the H20 is only 15% that of the H100. Furthermore, when comparing \"Performance Density\" based on the Float 16 data type, the H20's single chip performance is only 3% of that of the H100.\n“However, by connecting a cluster of H20 GPUs, performance can reach 50% of that of the H100, thanks to higher networking bandwidth and the HBM density of H20,” analysts pointed out. “And hence it is possible the H20 chip price could also be 50% of H100.”_\n\nJensen keeps telling y’all the world isn’t waiting on shit — the AI race is on now, and there’s no stopping it in the near future. Does that guarantee NVDA will dominate like this for the next decade?

You must work under the assumption that outputs will get cheaper by orders of magnitudes over decade(s), as they will, and it will force application strategies to change over time/afford different opportunities.\n\n#\n\n\n2. Current LLMs are meant to understand language, not be intelligent. The intelligence they demonstrate **must** arise from a probabilistic understanding of language, which in itself is a Nobel prize in the works for the linguists/philosophers who can develop rigorous theory that explains what we are empirically witnessing.\n\n#\n\n\n3. We've barely been through a single hardware generation.\n\n#\n\n\nThose 3 things are pivotal understandings. \n\n1 tells you that, when thinking about future AI powered solutions, the current paradigms should not be given too much weight for potential future paradigms. This is because the strategy you choose to employ will change if you believe you need a good output in ~3 model generations (now) vs ~3000 in the near-future. It's like getting 3 years to answer a question vs 3 hours - we should expect meaningful impact using that lever.\n\n\n2 tells you that this is very much the stupidest these models will ever be. Considering 1, we should think about how training an intelligent model has changed now that we have access to a language-understanding node. Currently (and we're just about over this phase), we train models by flooding it with text, having it self-recognize patterns in language (attention layers), and then having it generate agreeable continuations/responses. And from that, we somewhat miraculously got models which generate probabilistic-intelligence (where 1+1=3 is a non-zero amount of correct - we don't like this, but it's fundamental in the standard transformer-based model which got us here). But now, we can imagine entirely different training paradigms where the LLMs understandings/embeddings are just the first phase, and on top of this we can, for instance, devise a more algorithmically-rigid logic center where things like 1+1=3 can be reduced to 0% amount of correct through repeatable deductions (AlphaGeometry is a rough idea, JEPA is also similar).\n\n3 tells you, again and with a full voice, **we have not seen anything yet**. 3 is what will power 1. This is the fundamental gravity on the entire sector - no one will be able to run ahead (within reason) without having a hardware advantage. Sure, human ingenuity can, does, and will continue to improve models at constant compute, but we are charging fully into the compute-fueled, generic-methods world where we cast our egos aside and subscribe to [the bitter lesson.](http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html).\n\n\nYou should expect that we create true AGI long before we understand how it could work, which also means no one should be able to tell you exactly how it will be created before it is, which means doomers and hypers are somehow equivalently misguided in their predictions. The only truth in this realm is compute - which means the rest is up for debate, but also that the importance of compute is not debatable - it is paramount.\n\n\nThe transformer architecture was realizable in the 80s, but even if you threw multiples of the worlds available compute at the time at it, realizing chatGPT would not be possible. You could have the source code and the datasets, but you'd barely be through a fraction of the training by the time ChatGPT popped out of a handful of A100s some 40 years later.\n\nIt's all a moon shot, but we already passed Jupiter last year - all that remains is landing amongst the stars.", "score": 7, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Step 1: Make a business\n\nStep 2: Learn your business to AI\n\nStep 3: ????\n\nStep 4: Profit", "score": 7, "replies": []}, {"body": "its more about saving costs etc. like the human sitting in a call center you're calling? will be done by a ai soon enough", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "Generative computing rather than retrieval.\n\nMaking entire movies for dirt cheap from a couple of prompts.

It combines two B200 Tensor Core GPUs with a Grace CPU, creating a highly integrated and powerful system[4].\n\n2. Performance: Nvidia claims the GB200 offers up to 30x performance increase compared to the same number of H100 Tensor Core GPUs for LLM inference workloads[4].\n\n3. Market Position: Nvidia has been leading the AI chip market, especially in the data center segment. The company's GPUs have been the go-to choice for AI and machine learning applications[5].\n\n4. Advanced Manufacturing: The Blackwell architecture GPUs are manufactured using a custom-built 4NP TSMC process, packing 208 billion transistors[4].\n\n5. Ecosystem: Nvidia has built a comprehensive ecosystem around its chips, including software like NVIDIA AI Enterprise and NIM inference microservices, which further enhances their capabilities[4].\n\n6. Adoption: Major cloud providers like AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure are planning to offer GB200-powered instances[4].\n\nWhile other companies like Intel, AMD, and various startups are working on AI chips, none have announced a product that directly compares to the GB200 in terms of its integrated design, performance claims, and ecosystem support. Intel's recent Gaudi 3 chip, for instance, is positioned as a competitor to Nvidia's previous generation H100, not the new GB200[1].\n\nIt's worth noting that the AI chip market is rapidly evolving, and competitors may announce new products in the future. However, as of now, Nvidia's GB200 stands out as a unique offering in the high-end AI chip market.\n\nSources\n[1] A Reality Check on Intel's New Chip | Brownstone Research https://www.brownstoneresearch.com/bleeding-edge/a-reality-check-on-intels-new-chip/\n[2] Unwrapping the NVIDIA B200 and GB200 AI GPU Announcements https://www.techpowerup.com/forums/threads/unwrapping-the-nvidia-b200-and-gb200-ai-gpu-announcements.320542/\n[3] Nvidia announces GB200 Blackwell AI chip, launching later this year https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/18/nvidia-announces-gb200-blackwell-ai-chip-launching-later-this-year.html\n[4] NVIDIA Blackwell Platform Arrives to Power a New Era of Computing https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-blackwell-platform-arrives-to-power-a-new-era-of-computing\n[5] Top 20+ AI Chip Makers of 2024: In-depth Guide - Research AIMultiple https://research.aimultiple.com/ai-chip-makers/", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Holy shit.
