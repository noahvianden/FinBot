Look at the sheer number of people who pre covid were working office jobs and commuting who are now WFH and thus not commuting. That isn't just an issue for office space. Thats an issue for all the retailers and restaurants that depended upon commuters going past their location. \n\nFundamentally we aren't seeing a recession. We are seeing a massive rotation in the economy and its creating a bunch of issues and opportunities all at once. That isn't to say there aren't major problems. There are always problems. There are always opportunities as well. Right now though the sheer amount of things in motion is well outside the norm. \n\nI think we will see this rotation continue for a few more months and then settle down a lot. My view is that the pandemic pushed all of this into motion. It took time for people to see how that would impact their business. Then it took time for them to make and implement plans on how to get their business onto a better path. That implementation part in particular likely takes a few years. Think about that as a timeline. You see pandemic impact your business. You need probably a year or more to realize its not going back to the way it was in some aspects. You then need lets say 3 months to plan how to pivot the business. Then another year to three years beyond that to wind down things you dont need and wind up things you need? Now if we start at March of 2020 we are looking at 2.25-4.25 years from then to early movers to get through that change. Tack on another year or so beyond that for them to see big results. Meanwhile the changes they made had cascading impacts on other businesses and those businesses began the process of changing as well, but starting later. \n\nMy guess is the bulk of the turmoil from the pandemic will take around 5 years from lets say the Summer of 2020. After that the bulk of the rotation will be complete and it will likely be much more stable from there. Until then we can expect a huge amount volatility as we discover some companies did a great job of pivoting and some did not. \n\nWhat we likely wont see is a recession. Instead we will see sectors that dip into recession territory while others are humming along just fine. For people who are involved in deeply impacted sectors it can be painful but some segments of the economy are already past the worst of it. Some are still in the midst of their problems, but unless all of it happens nearly at once its unlikely to be a recession. It might still be ugly for the stock market simply because mispricing will be discovered along the way.\n\nNow before anyone starts thinking I'm nuts or something take a look at the sp500 minus the mag 7. All that underperformance for so long basically screams the market didnt run them up because they were waiting for this to all get resolved. Most of those stocks can't go much lower at all. They are looking at a vwap on a multi year timeframe that is highly supportive. Now the mag 7 on the other hand and some high flyers outside of the mag 7 could see some big plunges. I won't be surprised if we get quite a few 30% declines on single stocks over the next few months, but while that is happening a lot of other companies will see positive price movement and will likely offset a decent amount of that decline. Not all of the downward movement will be balanced out, but it won't be a huge market wide plunge. \n\nI expect we will dip close to August 5th lows, but not below them by much or for long if we do test that low. We will see a bunch of back and forth leading up to the election and then post election we will likely see the market resolve to move up until some time in December.\n\nIf you still feel like selling off your stuff have at it, but before you do please go look at a 5 year chart of spy.
