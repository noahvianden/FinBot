Yes, the market is still slightly overstretched, but if there isn't a sudden financial crisis, macro-driven tops come in gradual waves. Economic indicators have softened somewhat - jobs, consumption, growth are back down to at or slightly below recent historical medians. Valuations are running moderately high for those levels. \n\nAll of that is why we just saw a small-moderate correction, over a couple month time period, since the Fed was taking their time.\n\nBut you are misunderstanding two extremely important things: \n\n1. The Fed has a historically quite large amount of ammunition, similar to the 1990s-early 00s before the 2008 crisis. Borrowing costs are high, consumer consumption is suppressed by expensive CC rates and Home Equity rates, business investment from IRA/CHIPs has tapered down and natural investment is also hampered by high rates. But the market is (imperfectly) forward-looking, and all of those items can be expected to improve as interest rates moderate over the next 6-18 months. \n\n2. Many other major economies have it much worse that the US right now. China is the purple elephamt here - in an extended property bubble collapse than makes 2008 in the US look tame. Europe continues to be pressured by Russia-Ukraine fallout. Brazil has signalled a need for some fiscal tightening, and has had downward pressure on the Real because Bolsonaro messed up the economy and COVID response so badly, so Lula has to play catchup. India is the only obvious bright spot, but the story there hasn't changed much. Canada is struggling from ballooning housing costs and Immigration pressures.\n\nWhat's the net effect of all that, in terms of global financial flows? It's to encourage a \"flight to relative safety\" - which means the US, because we anchor the international monetary system. All of that points to another leg up, but probably less crazy than the run since post-COVID bottoming. \n\nWhen to expect the next top?
