Doing things this way allows you to budget trades with a preset risk built into them and allows access to instruments that you could not ordinarily play with the wheel.  Relatedly, defined risk allows you to have a far more diverse set of trades on in different underlyings at any one time than the wheel would.\n\nA three-wide, after all, is a three-wide, regardless of the instrument it's in, so that you can play everything from SPY and QQQ (which your account is far too small to wheel) down to $20 underlyings without having to navigate troublesome meme/quasi meme stocks with sketchy strike availability and/or non-robust term structure (i.e., no weeklies, limited monthlies) or having to gravitate toward quasi-meme sub-$20 stocks with high IV because that is the only thing you can afford to play.\n\nIn my experience, the general progression of things from a smaller to a larger account should be (a) narrow defined; (b) wider defined; (c) naked; (d) multiple nakeds (with various other tools in the tool kit deployed when it's appropriate and where the setup makes sense for your account size).", "score": 177, "replies": [{"body": "This person did a lot of work for you, OP.

My analysis assumes the stocks are bought once a month - at the beginning of every month. It can extended to rebalance everyday but not everyone can do that.\n\nInitial investment: $1,000\n\nMonthly investment: $100\n\n**Strategies**\n\n* Buy and hold: buy the top N market cap stocks of a given month. Do not sell the stock if it's not in the top N list in the following months.\n* Rebalance: If an existing stock in the portfolio is not in the top\\_n stocks list in the current month then  check when was the last month it was part of the top\\_n market cap stocks. If the resulting month difference is greater or equal to¬†`rebalance_threshold_months`¬†then sell the stock and tax the gains. The sale proceeds (minus short term taxes) are added to the monthly investment budget equally among the current top\\_n stocks. If there was a loss then I simply use the total sale proceeds. Eg, Assume AMZN was top 3 stocks last month but not this month.  If the threshold months is 1 then we sell AMZN this month, tax the gains, and distribute the sale proceeds equally to buy this months top 3 stocks.\n\nBacktesting.
