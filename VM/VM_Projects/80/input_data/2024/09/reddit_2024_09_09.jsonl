{"title": "Intel is a pretty safe bet and are undervalued ", "selftext": "There is a lot of dread and uncertainty surrounding Intel, and them missing performance targets and suffering reduced profits has hammered their stock price. This combined with the uncertainty with the viability of their future fabs compared to TSMC has resulted in investors bailing out. \n\n  \nThis however, it is shortsighted I think. It's worth remembering that a lot of investors don't exactly know what they are doing, especially when they don't understand the business or the industry at all. Intel is clearly very undervalued and is likely a very strong buy right now. \n\n  \nFirst it's worth listing the various issues Intel has right now, which is causing the crisis: \n\n\\* Intel has had a recent hardware issue that has hurt the brand. \n\n\\* Intel has lost a lot of server market share to AMD and RISCV.\n\n\\* The competition in the server space has shrunk their margins, which will likely never return. \n\n\\* Intel employs significantly more people than their competitors, increasing costs. \n\n\\* Intel has been missing their revenue and profit targets. \n\n\\* Intel cannot receive chips revenue until they complete their 18A fabs. \n\n\\* Intel is taking on a lot of debt to build their new fabs. \n\n\\* TSMC currently has a more advanced process than Intel and it's not guaranteed that Intel will surpass them in density with 18A. \n\n\\* Intel is using their competitor (TSMC) on their newest desktop and mobile CPUs. \n\n\\* Intel's recent chips have generally been seen to be worse than AMD. \n\n\\* Intel has no presence in the console gaming space. \n\n\\*Intel lost Apple.\n\n\\*Intel has no phone chips. \n\n  \nAll of this seems bad, but I think there are various reasons why they are a good buy. First, Intel has had their Intel 3 and Intel 4 fabs come online. While these don't compare to TSMC's latest process, it's worth remembering that these fabs are being used for Intel's server chips, which are currently competing with AMD's Zen 4 chips, as their Zen 5 server chips aren't out yet. The Zen 4 server chips use TSMC 5nm which is comparable to Intel's Intel 3 and Intel 4 fabs. The advantage here is that the margins should be higher using their own fabs instead of buying capacity at TSMC. \n\n  \nWhile 18A won't be used in commercial chips until next year, it should at least match TSMC in density and come with some new process innovations that will put them in the lead to some extent. It won't really be certain if Intel will surpass TSMC using 14A comes out, but we'll need to wait for 2027 for that. \n\n  \nThere was a concern that Intel might have an inferior design team to AMD, as it was unclear if their issues were with the process or the design, as their desktop and mobile chips had been stuck on an outdated 10NM process for years now. This is resulted in numerous power and heat issues. There was no reason to buy Intel over AMD unless you got a great deal on an Intel chip. Recently Intel released Lunar Lake (using TSMC 3NM), which is the best low TDP mobile chip on the market currently. Significantly better performance than AMD and Qualcomm and much better battery life. AMD doesn't currently have any mobile chips with efficiency cores and I'm not sure when they will. These are basically required to achieve good battery life on low TDP devices with an x86 processor. This release bodes well for Arrow Lake (which will be launching next month), and shows that Intel's design team is highly competitive still. \n\n  \nArrow Lake will be releasing in a month and I expect it to surpass Zen 5 in single and multicore performance across the board. The only area it might be worse is in some gaming workloads, because Intel doesn't currently have a high-cache chip planned to compete with X3D. However, Intel has indicated that they plan to eventually have an answer to AMD's X3D. The Zen 5 X3D chips have been rumored to release in 2025, which is worth noting. The reason I think Arrow Lake will easily beat AMD's chips are as follows:\n\n\\* Zen 5's release was considered disappointing, with small gains over Zen 4\n\n\\* Intel was somewhat competitive with Zen4 even when using an outdated 10NM process. \n\n\\* Via the use of efficiency cores, Intel will be placing higher core count CPUs in direct competition to the lower core count Zen 5 chips. Likely easily beating them in multicore performance. \n\n\\* Intel has historically been better than AMD in single core workloads, and only really fell behind when AMD was able to leverage TSMC's more advanced process. \n\n\\* Intel is using TSMC 3NM, while AMD used TSMC 4NM. This means that if everything is equal, Intel should automatically have the edge due to a process advantage. \n\n  \nIt's worth noting that the majority of chips sold aren't sold directly to end users and are negotiated with OEMs, which is why Intel, even with inferior chips were still able to have much higher revenue than AMD. The OEMs are locked in with Intel. Intel putting out competitive chips with AMD basically nullifies the need to switch to AMD. \n\nIntel is also committed to keep releasing discrete graphics cards. While these don't necessarily compete with Nvidia, AMD has been very weak here lately, which gives Intel the opportunity to supplant them. The added reason why this is good as it lets Intel cut into the markets where AMD has been able to thrive (those with intensive graphics needs).  \n\nThe final thing worth mentioning is that Intel decided that their fabs would be open to customers and wouldn't be exclusively for Intel's use. While in the present, this doesn't matter much, but if they are competitive with TSMC it could in theory result in higher revenue than Intel's entire design team. And I do believe that it's likely this occurs, even if it takes awhile. The reason for this is that the US government decided that the US needs to have domestic leadership in chips manufacturing and will continue to invest heavily to ensure that this is accomplished. AMD, Nvidia, Apple, and Qualcomm do not have their own fabs are will not receive this money, while Intel will. If and when Intel becomes competitive with their fabs it is likely you could see even Apple and Nvidia as customers of theirs. An additional benefit is that Intel can leverage their fabs in order to achieve higher margins for their own products. \n\n  \nIt's possible Intel's stock could be hit again in a month or so when their report comes out, but they are likely already at bottom.
