I've chosen not to reveal the ticker for a few reasons:  \n  \n- It might hurt my position.  \n- I don't want to use this board to support a personal penny stock play.  \n- I don't want others following me into my ultra high-risk play and losing money.  \n  \nBut I will reveal all in the next couple of days and we can either laugh at my incompetence or enjoy a nice Chamillionaire song together... time will tell.  \n  \n**EDIT (6:51 AM EST)**\nAlright all: Before I reveal my ticker let me say that this is a penny stock that you absolutely should not play, unless you are prepared to lose *every last cent of your money*, because if you ride this train long enough you will.  I am in this stock because I caught wind of it being an upcoming promotion stock by some big time promoters who were behind Stevia First Corp (*http://www.google.com/finance?q=stvf*).  I believe that it will be launched this morning, in a couple of hours, and will have significant gains because of this.  This is a new ticker (as is common with these sorts of things), and the volume so far has been significant with only mild gains in price.  \n  \nThe Ticker is: **ORYN**  (It's a new ticker, so some brokerages may not be able to find it.  If you have E-Trade, you will be able to see it though; *http://www.google.com/finance?q=oryn*)  \n  \nHere's the 'website': *http://www.oryontech.com/* (The quality of that website is pretty significant for this to be a run-of-the-mill p&d, so I'm betting this is a big promo)  \n  \nRisks?  If this doesn't get promoted soon, the bottom may fall out, and I might take several arrows to the knee (which may affect my long term profitability).  Also, if AwesomePennyStocks releases suddenly, the speculative penny stock money might drop out of this thing and rush to *that* ticker.  Also?  You know what this is, when it comes down to the bottom line.  Trade accordingly, even if (when) the price does take off.  \n  \n*Full disclosure:* **I went all in yesterday at 0.92 cents/share**.  \n  \n**EDIT (8:25 AM EST)**   \n*http://i.imgur.com/OmNuj.png*  \n  \n**EDIT (8:56 AM EST)**  \nHadoken! *http://i.imgur.com/BXu0K.png*  \n  \n**EDIT (12:42 PM EST)**  \nSonic Boom! *http://i.imgur.com/OQZz3.png*  \n  \n**EDIT (13:51 PM EST)**\nAll out of ORYN at $1.15 for the time being; may buy back in later.\n\n**EDIT (14:39 PM EST)**\nWhy did I leave my position?

I am very curious.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Ok, I will give you a brief rundown of my risk/money management practices. They are not necessarily best practice, but my rules are simple and effective.\n\nIf you are not familiar with standard risk management practices, there are three steps in the process:\n\n1. Define how much of your total account you can risk on each trade.\n\n2. Define the size of your stop loss.\n\n3. Use the combination of 1 and 2 to determine how many shares/contracts to buy.\n\n**Step 1**\n\nI will risk no more than 2% of my account on any one trade. This allows the amount that I risk to vary as my account balance changes.\n\nIf I have $1,000 to trade with, I will risk no more than $20 per trade. If I have $10,000 to trade with, I will risk no more than $200 per trade. If I have $100,000 to trade with, I will risk no more than $2,000 per trade.\n\nHow large your account may be is irrelevant, what is important is that you only risk 2% on each trade. You need to risk a small amount so that you can stay in the trading game. You cannot trade without capital and you cannot be right on every single trade. Losses are part of the game and are to be expected. Risking 2% on each trade means that I could get stopped out of 10 trades in a row, and would only lose 20% of my account. I am comfortable with this level of risk.\n\n**Step 2**\n\nWith reference to my [SPX trade setup](http://i.imgur.com/KkYWu.png), my short entry was entered at 1388 (the blue line). **Prior** to taking my short entry, I determined that my stops would be placed behind the high of the blue candle that recently pierced the 1388 level (if you need to, count back, the candle I am referring to was 12 candles ago in the SPX trade setup image).\n\nThe high of this blue candle defined my stop level as being at 1390. \n\nStop level - Entry level = 1390 - 1388 = 2. My risk was 2 handles.\n\n**Step 3**\n\nNow we know that I am risking 2% of my account, and that the trade setup needs a stop of 2 handles. Therefore, we can determine how large of a position to take.\n\n1 Mini contract = $1 per pip movement.\n1 Standard contract = $10 per pip movement.\n10 Minis = 1 Standard\n\nFor this exercise, assume my account is $10,000 (similar to yours).\n\nAmount that I can risk is 2% * $10,000 = $200\n\nAmount that I can risk per pip is $200/2 pips = $100 per pip\n\n1 Standard contract = $10/pip. Therefore 10 Standard contracts = $100/pip. Number of contracts that I can short is 10 Standard contracts.\n\nTherefore, I short 10 Standard contracts at 1388 and put my stops at 1390. \n\nIf the trade goes wrong, I have lost $200. This is exactly the same amount that I would lose, regardless of the trade. THIS IS MY WORST CASE SCENARIO. On every trade. What changes with each trade is the number of contracts that I can buy. The amount that I lose when a trade stops me out is constant.\n\nIf I had used a stop loss of 20 pips instead of 2 pips, then I could only have shorted 1 Standard contract within my defined risk parameters.\n\n($200/20 pips = $10/pip = 1 Standard contract)\n\n**Result**\n\nWith reference to my [SPX Trade Result](http://i.imgur.com/GOKOs.png), I closed my trade at 1348. \n\n1388 - 1348 = 40 handles.\n\nRisk was 2 handles, trade was closed for 40 handles.\n\n40/2 = 20R\n\nThe trade was closed for 20x the amount that I originally risked. I originally risked 2% of my account.\n\n2% * 20R = 40%.\n\nThe trade returned 40% of my account. Or in this specific example\n\n$200 * 20R = $4,000\n\nIn this example I made $4,000 on this trade, but that is not what is important. What is very important, and what readers need to take away from this example, is that I only risked $200 to make $4,000. \n\nI only risked 2% to make 40%.
