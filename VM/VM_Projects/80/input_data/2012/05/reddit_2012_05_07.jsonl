The asshats will buy them all up before retail investors like you or me ever get a chance.\n\nThey'll go for sale at $45 a share for the first retail investors later on Friday, and will be down to $39 by days end.\n\nThere will be bumps up, but probably not above $40 at any point. I expect to see them around $30 in a month, and $25 in 3 months. Then we'll see...around there they may be worth it, for a short term trade.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "the shares are available to the inside investors(underwriters) for 35-40. but you have to be with that institution, which you probabbly are not. the stocks we buy are on the \"secondary market\". the stock price gets inflated by demand from the bids/asks before the market opens. so like groupon, it can pop to 24 from an ipo price of 14. However, if the demand isn't hot, like zynga, the pop price will be 11.50 from an ipo price of 10.  \nthe catch is, if theres a big pop(linkdin), then your profit margin shrinks from your ride the wave.  \nif there is a lackluster pop (zynga) there will be no wave", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "E-Trade and other brokers have an \"IPO Center\" usully that will let u put in to buy at the IPO price.
