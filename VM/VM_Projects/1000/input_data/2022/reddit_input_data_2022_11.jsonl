Everyday I come to this sub for entertainment and not once have I ever been disappointed. The undeniable reality is that the market does what it does and nobody understands why, yet every other motherfucker in every comment section is certain about where the market heads next. “This is definitely a bear market rally. But also maybe that was the bottom. But we’ll probably see new lows by January.” Do you idiots ever pull your heads out of your gambling addict asses and realize that your basing all of your financial decisions on blind conviction? Every time I see another genius in these threads commenting with certainty about where the market’s headed, all I can picture is Adam Sandler telling Julia Fox “I’m gonna hit so big, baby,” and we all know how that ended.\n\nSeriously, I was reading a comment by some degenerate moron yesterday about how many puts he bought after the media reported missiles over Poland. Before this fucking idiot even gets conclusive reporting, he’s dumping his wife’s IRA contributions into NVDA puts in one of worst tech bear markets in history, all while feeling low key excited by the prospect of WW3. Pathetic. Also notice I’m assuming “he,” that’s because no woman on earth could possibly be capable of such meat-headed idiocy. Seriously. You’re all fucking unbelievable and you’ll never win this game long term with such degenerate, irrational behavior.\n\nPositions: All in PLTR, loading QNT XRP BTC on FTX collapse news.

Not for all ofc.\n\nThe EV business is radically different from the ICE business. You cant just take your 1 million production ICE vehicles and switch them over to EVs in a year. You basically have to start from scratch. Not only from hardware but also software side. And next to all those challenges are the raw material constraints for the battery alone, but that's other companies dealing with.\n\nYes there are a lot EVs comming out from different companies. And some are actual decent, but like I said, you have to scale this new car architecture. We have seen that this is not that easy, because no traditional car company still hasn't sold as many cars as tesla and many haven't even sold half the amount. And we have heard the competition is comming argument for at least 5 years or longer.\n\nThe longer it takes the competiton to catch up, the more difficult it will be. Just a few days ago for example, there was an announcement from the VW group that the trinity project has been delayed for years. Next to all those challenges, you have to be also profitable. Imagine your business relies on the profits on the ICE cars to survive and now you have to disrupt your own business with unprofitable EVs.\n\nOver time they might have to sell as many cars as tesla, or maybe not idk. This leads to the competitve advantage:\n\n* Like Elon said, the long term goal of tesla is the manufacturing expertise. Even right now, while scaling two huge factories, tesla has leading industry margins, which itself could be an argument for lower margins.Last Quarter tesla did 8 times more profit per car than toyota.If I remember correctly Tesla right now, is 3x more profitable than GM.\n* Supercharging expertise. Tesla is and has been building superchargers all over the world. Ofc there are a lot of different brands too, but no OEM has even close to the amount, like tesla. With Solar and Battery storage next to those stations - after breaking even - this could maybe generate over time decent money. But this is still in the stars. Nonetheless this supercharging network can also be used by different car brands, acting already right now as a extra revenue stream.\n* Autonomous Driving. The overall trend of the disruption of the car industry, won't be just EVs. It will most likely be self driving cars and probably 'robotaxis'. Tesla has the advantage to access its whole fleet, for specific situations to train the neural networks for. Tesla can also opimize and leverage on the fact, that it's all in-house and not a third party. (which nearly all other OEMs do).Yes there are already crusing Cruise and Waymo around, but IMHO the 'best-possible' solution is just pure vision, without any sensors. But we will see which is the best way, maybe even both.\n* There are also some other ways Tesla could generate money over the future, but those things are probably too far away.

The company reported record deliveries earlier in the month, and the vehicle volume growth was present in the company’s financial results as it generated record revenue. Despite the continued ramp up of the two new factories (one in Austin, Texas in the U.S. and one in Berlin, Germany), companywide operating margin improved sequentially versus the second quarter. This is in line with our view that the factories will become more profitable each quarter as production increases, eventually leading to margin expansion.\n\nDespite the signs of improvement in line with our long-term outlook, shares were down 5% in after-hours trading. With our outlook intact, we view Tesla shares as slightly undervalued, with the stock trading a little more than 15% below our fair value estimate but in 3-star territory. As such, we recommend investors wait for a larger margin of safety before considering an entry point.\n\nWe think some of the after-hours selloff is due to revenue coming in slightly below consensus estimates. Given that the company already reported lower deliveries, we think consensus may have been expecting higher average price increases during the quarter. We calculate a 5% year-on-year price increase and we expect average selling prices to rise further in the coming quarters. Given that Tesla’s backlog was roughly 3-6 months of production, we think there will likely be a lag from when the company raises prices to when it shows up on the financials.\n\nOur long-term outlook is intact. We expect Tesla will eventually grow vehicle deliveries to over 5 million vehicles by 2031. We forecast the company will be able to reduce unit production costs, while also growing ancillary services including autonomous driving software and insurance subscriptions, driving margin improvement.\n\nI agree with Morningstar.

The stock has also been boosted by the pre-2022 bull market, its admission to the S&P, low interest rates, FOMO (as described by a commenter above), and Musk’s aura. \n\nBut now the S&P index is down over 20% and will likely lose another 20% if we enter a recession and/or if interest rates rise.

The report draws on our team of specialists around the world and looks at scenarios for how these trends will impact the automotive, oil, electricity, infrastructure and battery materials markets, as well as CO2 emissions.*  \n**EV sales**  \nEV sales are surging due to a combination of policy support, improvements in battery technology, more charging infrastructure and new compelling models from automakers. Electrification is also spreading to new segments of road transport, setting the stage for huge changes ahead.  \n**Passenger EV sales**  \nChina still dominates the global EV market, but sales are rising quickly elsewhere too. Battery electrics are pulling ahead of plug-in hybrids and the gap is set to widen further in the years ahead.  \n**Oil displacement from EVs**  \nEVs of all types are already displacing 1.5 million barrels per day of oil usage, equivalent to about 3% of total road fuel demand.  \n**Lithium-ion battery demand**  \nBattery demand is rising sharply, putting pressure on the supply chain for materials like lithium, cobalt and nickel.  \n**Reaching net zero by 2050**  \nThis year’s report includes a “Net Zero” scenario which investigates what a potential route to carbon neutrality looks across all segments of road transport by 2050. It also includes five thematic highlights on important emerging topic areas:  \n•\tThe EV adoption gap between wealthy and emerging economies  \n•\tThe supply and demand dynamics for battery metals from now to 2030  \n•\tHeavy duty long-haul trucking: batteries versus hydrogen fuel cells  \n•\tReshaping mobility demand through modal shifts  \n•\tThe value of vehicle-to-grid: A U.K. case study  \n**Key number:**  \n**$53 Trillion** \\- Size of the electric vehicle market opportunity between today and 2050 in the Economic Transition Scenario.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I'm too offput by Elon's behavior to ever consider a Tesla.
