That doesn't mean everyone made money on it, or that everyone who made predictions about GME based on public info was correct. In hindsight of course you can look at the short interest and say a squeeze was primed to happen. In reality, short interest was high for a long time; in reality, some stocks maintain high short interest without ever seeing a squeeze.\n\n> Is OPs information actually invalid simply because it’s more bullish and appeals to confirmation bias?\n\nNo of course not. But remember OP is providing 2 things: Information, which anyone can look up and verify, and an opinion on future market movements. Why should I trust OP's interpretation of the data? Is it any more valuable to me than asking a child what they think of it? Lately this sub has been upvoting a lot of *opinions* and there's nothing wrong with that inherently, but in general I really don't trust anyone's interpretation of the data here. \n\nI mean OP's grand theory boils down to a gamma squeeze due to high open interest in contracts expiring on a quad witching day. Few issues:\n\n\\1. Quad witching day means it's monthly contract expiry. Open interest is almost ALWAYS higher on monthly contracts than weekly, and we don't see massive monthly gamma squeezes.\n\n\\2. OP doesn't work through the pretty simple math to analyze these movements. Let's check out something he calls \"HUGE\":\n\n> YES, that is 127,885 contracts at a $5 strike. HUGE. If this hits $5 it could just as easy keep going.\n\nOkay but those $5 strikes are 25% OTM, have 90% implied volatility, 16 delta, 30 gamma. Open interest represents $768,000 of capital and if all the sellers are perfectly hedged, about 2M shares or $8M in capital. If the stock goes to $5 tomorrow, delta will be about 55 so hedging would require buying another 5M shares. Volume today was nearly 30M, and that's the second lowest it's been this month. So how much is another 5M shares in volume really going to affect the price? Picking 1/28, a day where price swung about 20% between the low and high, had volume of 675M. You see the mismatch in scale? And this is assuming the best case for bulls, that this massive swing happens all in a day. A more realistic scenario is that this happens slowly over a couple weeks, and that 5M in volume is maybe more like 10M (overestimate) in volume to account for delta being a bit higher closer to expiration. That 10M is spread out over weeks where there's hundreds of millions of shares traded. \"HUGE\" gamma squeeze on Nokia? I'll press X to doubt.\n\n\\3. Somewhat minor point: OP is looking at call volume of a bunch of reddit meme stocks with high short interest.

The vendor told him that these used to be very good and reliable cars, but VW isn't so good with embedded technology.\n\nAll in all I am shocked how little they improved over years, especially given the size and resources of VW.

Tesla's margins are low now but they are on a near exponential 📈 ramp for production which is expected in growth phase.

Betting against a company that more high end consumers are willing to pay more for their product and leave their previous high end brand  despite high consumer loyalty seems like bad logic to me.

Tesla doesn't just sell cars but their cars validate their electric brand and ecosystem.

These means they're opened up to a new risk because \"short swing\" profits (profits gained if you sell your shares within 6 months) can legally have to be returned to the company if you sell. This is sometimes done at very unfavourable rates (which may actually make you lose money). This means that they can't sell many of their holdings as quickly as they want to.  \n\n\nAlso, many of these companies are also really small and illiquid themselves, making even selling those shares difficult. Which could cause significant problems in and of itself.   \n\n\nThis is all becoming an issue because of really recent outflows that will force selling some holdings and such. It's really complicated and I haven't got my head around it all yet but effectively it means bad news for ARK.  \n\n\nThe implications for Tesla are clearer, it could mean that if ARK starts to sink for it's own structural issues it might start liquidating a lot of it's Tesla share which atm would look like selling off something like  1,860,000,000 USD's worth of Tesla (given that it's around 600ish and they own 3.1m shares) which would totally slaughter Tesla's value.

Tesla has had a long waiting list for a long time, it's difficult to get a hold of a Tesla and production hasn't managed to catch up despite a huge amount of time to readjust to demand.

However, if that's the case and Tesla's going to have only 10% of the global EV market - *a market that will not include vast swathes of Africa, South America and Asia (minus urban China and India)* *for logistical and geographical reasons* \\- then we have to call into account it's current valuation.

If that's the projection that you're going with, even if we ignore the various limitations of electric vehicles that will continue for the foreseeable future, then Tesla is considerably overvalued for what it is and price will have to be brought back to realistic territory. \n\nUnless Tesla can keep a hold on at least 40-50% of the global EV market, which is unlikely given general market concentration breakdowns of car manufacturing, then it's value is going to collapse.

Which means it can now shamble onwards, gobbling up market share. Also, profit margins can be deceptive, cash flow from ops is around 24bn at the minute and can sustain the debt the company has, for now. Even if Ford goes bust (which it probably should ngl) that doesn't mean the Mach-E will go, most likely it'll be cut up and bits of it will be acquired and the Mustang brand will be taken on by someone else.\n\nAt the end of the day, this isn't about whether Ford is a better company, it's about the fact that Ford just proved that an established brand can quickly establish market share in the US EV markets.

I think the main driver is the increased competition, VW has been involved in EV research since the 1970s and tested it's first electric car in 1972 and were producing low-volume commercial EVs and playing around with hybrids from the 1990s. I don't think the same gap between European manufacturers and what Tesla offered existed as between Tesla and American manufacturers. Really, until the last few years if you'd asked me about EVs I probably would've talked about VW. In absence of that perception gap, I think a lot of people in European markets are willing to trust and value established brands rather than this strange American interloper who's offering what feels like a new type of a familiar product, that thing with European car companies have been trying to push for awhile.\n\nPlus, i'll not lie but a lot of continental Europeans (basically the Germans and French) often have a pretty snobbish attitude towards the Americans and American products.

If you have more money, you have more demand and *IF* supply cannot meet demand, prices rise to price out the lowest bidders.  This is why having an underutilized labor force is a buffer against inflation and why Keynes and many others pointed out that govt expenditure to raise demand is the correction to a cold economy.

If those dollars have a chance to create economic activity (demand), then supplies will be strained and prices will rise. \n\nI agree with that fully.  However, when you have increased demand, the demand for labor increases to fill that demand.  After all, businesses to not want to leave unfulfilled demand on the table.  So hiring picks up.  Since there is massive untapped labor to be utilized in filling that demand, inflation will be transitory, as Powell and Yellen have both pointed out.  \n\nThe thing is that the money supply is only correlated to inflation and where that money is in the economy will have massively different effects.  If most of the new money has no velocity as it has for decades in the US, inflation will be low, again as it has been.

In fact this last point can be tied back to the velocity point.  The vast majority of new money for the last 40 years has went to corporations and tax cuts to the wealthy.

Believe me, I've been here before.\n\nSo, will it be in 2021? 2022? 2023? Don't ask me, I don't know. And that's THE POINT.

Stocks on the cheap!\" or \"Ouch, margin calls are not fun\"? Up to you.\n\nBut the money printing will increase inflation, which will increase nominal interest rates and maybe even real rates, making fixed income comparatively more attractive than it will have been for many years, so who knows how much money will flow that way.\n\nFor now everything looks completely fine, even through the rona lockdowns and all that.

{"title": "List of books to read if you want to actually become knowledgeable about stocks and not stay a normie who doesn't know what they're doing", "selftext": "I'm about to hit you all with some knowledge, so get your big kid pants on! You should read these books in the order they are listed, because they stack up on top of each other and the lessons learned in one are needed to understand the lessons in the next.\n\n*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor or registered securities analyst.*\n\n*Another disclaimer: If you do not know what exactly a stock is, how to buy or sell a stock or what dividends and earnings are, please look up some crash courses on YouTube or something before starting this list.*\n\n**Let's begin:**\n\n1. **The Little Book of Common Sense Investing by John Bogle** \\- For those of you who don't know, John Bogle is one of the most important people to ever walk this planet when it comes to stocks and investing for the average person. He founded a little company called Vanguard (ever heard of it?) and he also invented the first index fund. In this book, Bogle gives us a primer on the classical approach to passive, conservative and long-haul investing. He goes into the statistics on how around 90% of mutual funds and most people can not beat the market. He makes it clear and simple that if you want to benefit from stock yields over time, you should deploy your money into index funds and sit back while earnings and dividends carry you to wealth. Many people (probably most people to be honest) can stop here and honestly do perfectly fine. The info in this book is all you need to build serious wealth. You will also understand the theory that picking individual stocks is usually a *losers game*. One of the reasons I believe you should read this book first is because the lessons you learn inside of it may show you that the rest of the books on this list may not even be worth reading! If you aren't content with boring old index fund investing though, you can read on..\n2. **One Up On Wall Street by Peter Lynch** \\- This book is dated but the principles written in its pages ring true to this day. Peter Lynch is considered one of the most successful mutual fund managers of all time. He achieved returns that beat the S&P 500 for over a decade straight for his investors in the Fidelity Magellan Fund in the 70's and 80's. Yes I know I said most people can't beat the market by picking stocks, which is why those who can do it consistently are very special. In this book he teaches you about the tools and strategies he used to achieve those results. It's a great book because it doesn't get too crazy in terms of math and logic, and it's easy to understand.\n3. **Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman -** Now it's time to take a break and get into the *psychology* behind stock investing. Let's be honest, we're all pretty stupid and we all have internal biases. These two facts can be serious roadblocks to investing success. The sooner you admit that the better off you'll be. This book will help you understand how to separate your irrational mind from your rational mind when investing and it will make you better at objective decision making.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\--\n\nOk, now at this point you have two paths you can take. After these three books you'll have a good grasp on the *theory* and *mindset* to making money in stocks, but you will be lacking the knowledge to actually ***pick individual stocks***. I mean how are you supposed to do that? Just buy whatever is trending on Reddit or what that idiot Jim Cramer on CNBC is talking about? Well as long as you still understand (from book #1) that the odds are against you when picking stocks, you can continue on one of two paths:\n\n**- The Value Investing Path** (Finding, analyzing and buying stocks that are \"undervalued\" and waiting for them to rise back to their fair market value, thus making a ton of money. This is what Warren Buffett does. It's also extremely difficult, boring and requires *rock-solid* emotional stability to ignore the ups and downs of the market.)\n\n\\-OR-\n\n**- The Traders Path** (Following market trends and sentiment to find opportunities that can make you money. I personally would not consider this path to be an \"investors\" path. This is a \"speculators\" path, and they are very different. However, you can make money speculating. This could involve shorting stocks or doing a bit of technical analysis, or maybe even playing with some derivatives like options. This path is also extremely difficult and will cause most people to lose *hours* of sleep each night sweating as they panic about their positions)\n\n\\--\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you chose **The Value Investing Path**, continue here:\n\n1. **All of the accounting books you can find** \\- You NEED to understand the fundamentals of accounting in order to value businesses. There is no getting around it. Yes, it's boring but if you find yourself enjoying it, you may have an inclination for this. Read everything you can on accounting. Learn to read balance sheets, income statements and cash flow statements. Learn about assets and liabilities. Do the practice assignments in the books and all of that!\n2. **The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham -** This is probably the most famous book on this list, and guess what, you're not going to understand ANY of it. This is the book that Warren Buffett swears by. In fact, Buffett studied with the author of this book when he was a lad. This book is the bible of value investing. Every successful investor knows this book. Within its pages you will learn about what to look for in the stock market, how to understand market behavior, what a good business looks like, how to find the *intrinsic value* of a company, and much much more. I recommend reading this book at least twice and researching everything inside it that you don't understand.\n3. **Margin of Safety by Seth Klarman -** Physical copies of this book are extremely expensive, so you're better off finding an online copy (shh don't tell). It's a bit more modern than the title above and it was written by a very successful value investor!\n4. **The Dhando Investor by Mohnish Pabrai** **-** Fantastic value investing book that offers some fresh ideas and new things to think about that are built on top of the previous books. Also written by a very successful investor.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you chose **The Traders Path**, continue here:\n\n1. **Reminiscences of a Stock Operator by Edwin Lefèvre** \\- A classic that most traders are told to read at some point in their lives. It teaches so many valuable lessons of reflecting on your wins/losses, psychology of trading, knowing yourself and your weaknesses and more fun stuff. It's an old book but definitely worth reading.\n2. **Getting Started in Technical Analysis by Jack Schwager**  \\- If you don't know, technical analysis (TA) is the process of finding opportunity by analyzing the market indicators such as price, volume and trends. It ignores company fundamentals and is often seen as a type of voodoo that you either believe in or you don't. I personally am not a fan, however I do recognize the importance TA plays in understanding some stocks at certain times. I do believe that in combination with other metrics, TA can provide valuable insight. This book will teach you the basics.\n3. **Fooled by Randomness by Nassim Nicholas Taleb -** It is not possible to predict the stock market. This book will help you reconcile with that. It will help with understanding how randomness and a bit of luck ties into not only your trading, but your whole life. You will learn about risks and the consequences of taking them.\n4. **Market Wizards by Jack Schwager** \\- Another great book by the same author as #2 above. This is written in a sort of conversation-like format where the author interviews some of the most successfully traders of the time. There is tons of information in this book on all of the topics we've discussed since it's like you're reading a conversation between two people.\n\nI hope this post will help some of you.\n\n**Honorable mentions:**\n\n\\- The Snowball - Alice Schroeder\n\n\\- Security Analysis - Benjamin Graham and David Dodd\n\n\\- A Random Walk Down Wall Street - Burton Malkiel\n\n\\- The Alchemy of Finance - George Soros\n\n\\- The Big Short - Michael Lewis\n\n\\- Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits - Philip Fisher\n\n\\- Value Investing: From Graham to Buffett and Beyond - Bruce Greenwald", "id": "m85sp6", "created_utc": 1616116387.0, "score": 9578, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 510, "comments": [{"body": "Hmmm did not see investing for dummies on this list...", "score": 238, "replies": [{"body": "r/wallstreetbets has that covered", "score": 155, "replies": [{"body": "You’re thinking of investing by dummies.", "score": 28, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Maybe there are a few versions of it but mine in german isnt really good.

Taking the month off to rest when you hit 20% losses and apply diff strategies, DCA, DRIPS, scaling in and scaling out, pyramiding , sector rotation or market timing etc.) \n\nRemember, don’t get caught up with FOMO, being flat is also a position. If you don’t know why you’re investing and don’t have a clear game plan, wait until you do before entering positions. \n\nOther then that, it’s a gamble play. \n\nLastly, Fundamentals.. learn how political, economical and social catalysts affect the economy, the market and most importantly, your investment.\n\nFor example, the inter-relationship of how stocks, bond prices, commodities and currencies affect each other and ultimately the market and economy.", "score": 238, "replies": [{"body": "Everyone learns differently.

For reference, the Vanguard S&P 500 index debuted in 1976. \n\nArthur Lipper petitioned the SEC to start an index tracking the DJIA way back in 1968 or '69, but it never got off the ground. The idea of index funds had been floating around for a few years at this point based on Eugene Fama's research from the University of Chicago, and had been boosted by Nobel laureate Paul Samuelson (among others) who said the typical mutual fund in the 1960s was a ripoff and people would be better served with passive management tracking an average market return. \n\nJeremy Grantham started an index fund for the public a few years later (1971) but it was such a radical idea he didn't have any customers for a while, not until 1973 or '74. Also starting in 1971, John McQuown managed part of a pension with an index fund while he worked at a Wells Fargo branch in San Fransisco. \n\nRex Sinquefield tracked the S&P 500 at a Chicago bank starting in 1973, open to the general public, and had billions of dollars under management after a few years. Sinquefild and McQuown both went on to work at Dimenaional Fund Advisors, started by U of Chicago alumni, whose oldest fund dates to 1981. \n\nSo while Boggle certainly desrves a lot of credit for promoting index funds, he simply did not invent them nor was he the first to sell them. the last time I checked, Dimensional Funds was still a top-10 American firm by assets under management. but they're not as well know as other firms, always done little or no advertising/promotion, preferring to let like-minded clients find them rather than seek them out. \n\nFor sources see Justin Fox's The Myth of the Rational Market, and this: https://www.stlmag.com/The-Return-of-the-King/\n\ngreat list, BTW.

It is messy out there, making it very difficult to trade. Honestly, if you’re down, that’s understandable because these are not normal conditions. We just had a 12 month flash course on market behavior. What we’ve witnessed in this short time happens in the span of 3+ years, not months.\n\nBright side is, we learned a lot. Through pain and punishment. Turns out those lessons are the most kept. It’s like we are little puppies.\n\n**So, what do we do?**\n\nWe do what seasoned traders have been doing for decades. We understand the basics of charts and practice technical analysis. It’s gonna be a long Sunday read but I promise, it’ll be an eye-opening one for most of you. Don’t worry. Basics are super simple and I won’t confuse you with pattern terminology.\n\nIf you’re not using these methods already, this post is going to improve the way you trade exponentially while minimizing losses if your trade begins going south.

Below is a **$7K buy-in, 0tde SPY 390 call** I traded on Friday. One hundred percent based on a known pattern.\n\nI'd like for you to pay attention to time of entrance (**at support**) and exit (**at resistance**) then match those with order execution times which you will find on top.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d2nrriswrgo61.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=78703c09cfc24458b1d63ddde0c022038dd1f72f\n\n**Back story**. Folks, I can't make this shit up if I want to. I'm two inches away from my screen, glued. Watching green candles pile up over support, printing...On the way to 390 resistance. I know if it breaks, we're going 391 easy..Last I saw was 389...Goddam power flickered, caused a reset on my modem. Panic sunk in.\n\nAbout 45 seconds later, connection came back. I remember I kept saying please be above 390...please be above 390....I knew as a fact, when it hits that major resistance at 390, there's a fat chance of rejection, sending my greens to red in matter of fifteen seconds.\n\nI saw 390.12 on screen. Smashed sell. Could've been a good trade gone wrong. My original plan was to sell half at resistance and sell the other half after a possible break out. Slightly above 391, those contracts were going for $1.50 per.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d0f493b8sgo61.jpg?width=519&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=61db8ae9c9f115ae33f5aacfbfd8f24e7cc3ddda\n\nLet’s step away from day trading, apply support and resistance basics on longer term charts. After all, you need to be mentally unstable in some way to even consider day trading.\n\nWe’re gonna take General Electric as example. Starting with it’s 6 month chart, then zoom into weekly.\n\nOn **October 10th 2018**, GE closed at what seems to be a random, insignificant price. $13.28.\n\nOn **February 12th 2020**, it hit $13.26. Failing to close above $13.30 once again. Think about it. After millions of trading volume and after 16 months, it touched the same number and traded down the following days. Crazy accuracy, couple cents.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3tumqvxssgo61.jpg?width=1532&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=06512087a5ea457dabb354960c24c5d548f495e2\n\nClearly, what seemed to be chaotic, random price action is not chaotic and random. It follows rules and order of it's own. Just like everything else around us.\n\nStay with me.\n\n**Drawing bearish and bullish channels**\n\nHere's the GE weekly chart. Each candle represents one hour.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pwxrsx91ugo61.jpg?width=1532&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d0b6361605df5fe66cfdac3d6c6cbe2c15b1a44b\n\nSuper simplified. You take the bottom of the **lowest candle** (**A**) and draw a line until it touches the bottom part of another candle that's trending up **(B).**\n\nNow, we repeat that on top portion. This time, starting a line at the top of candle **(C)** and ending at another candle that is trending up **(D).** Bullish channel is complete.\n\nUsing same principals, you can also draw a bearish channel. In that case, instead of pointing up, channel will be pointing down.\n\nNext, we’re going to add to our chart what’s proven to be the resistance at $13.2x. Purple horizontal line.\n\nGuess what price GE closed on Friday. 🤯\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ssi2kllbvgo61.jpg?width=1529&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6e6ac7bbb85f40bd35a4232c794b39f8f4d54cfc\n\n**So, buying short expiry puts Monday on GE is free money? It failed to break resistance again and again.**\n\nNo. Analyze the chart below. Area I highlighted shows it actually did break the resistance intraday and held all the way to closing bell. There’s a big possibility that resistance is now a potential support. What we’re seeing on the highlighted portion could be the back test of said support, closing at $13.2x and not below it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kma6obvoxgo61.jpg?width=1529&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6a7be213dc070bc178a35316600bfa84a8f77ea4\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**As a case study, what do we look for Monday eod?**\n\nWe look for confirmation. If we see a strong green candle close above $13.50, in my book that’s a long buy (calls). Likely 13.2x resistance becoming support.\n\nIf we see a strong red candle finish below 13, breaking down our bullish channel, that signals resistance held once again and it will most likely continue to go down, once again. Puts galore.\n\n**Here’s the part that matters for you the most.**\n\nDo not buy calls near major resistance. Period. Buy the confirmed support. Sell the confirmed resistance.\n\nWe see paper handing comments all the time. “If I were to hold two more days, I could’ve doubled my money”.\n\nWhy would you sell when you see green candles making higher highs inside a bullish channel? Sell when it’s close to resistance.\n\n**What about red candles inside the channel?** \n\nIt's okay. Take a look back at the **0tde SPY 390c** chart. If I were to see red candles getting close to support, I would’ve sold and worst case scenario lose 10-15%.\n\n**Buy at support, sell at resistance. Buy at support, sell at resistance and don’t look back.**\n\nApply these principals to your weeks, months out expiry contracts. Pull charts that each candle represents 4 hours minimum, one day candles ideally. TA is much easier and accurate when it's based on longer time frames. **I'm telling ya, damn thing closed at 13.2x two years ago!**\n\n**Minimizing losses when trade goes south.**\n\nThis is the hardest part to execute. Denial, hope, what ifs... I lost $24K two weeks ago by not practicing what I'm about to preach.\n\nI added red candles on our GE Chart to simulate a support break. Each candle represents four hours. Take a look. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hzjczrif3ho61.jpg?width=1529&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8d1495016c42c920d0cf0754011f7d8a142cb5e6\n\nAt this point, it's pretty much gg. Even though we see a green candle at the end, due to time decay, calls are destroyed. Basically, it needs 3 perfect green candles just to get back inside and 3 more candles to start trending up in the channel. 4 hour candles, by the time that happens, 30-50% poofed. In this scenario, I bet bears would buy puts at first sight of support break which I wouldn't blame and definitely participate.\n\n**I'd like to point this out again. Some charts I showed you guys as examples are short time-framed. You're better off applying these basics on charts that each candle represents one day, assuming your position is not expiring in 48 hours. Remember this as beginners, longer expiration, more data, better TA. More gains, less losses.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI’m anxious to see how next week is going to play out. We’re stuck, yo-yoing between support and resistance on pretty much all indexes and big caps. It’s simply not possible for me as an apprentice trader to speculate.\n\nWhat I know is this. I’m not touching TSLA. I’m not touching AAPL or SPY or QQQ or any ticker that has been chopping up and down between support and resistance. Bunch of noise. Time decay. Not good for option contracts.\n\nI want to see resistance break and hold for calls.\n\nI want to see support fail for puts.\n\nDon't know about you but I like my money. Not going to close my eyes, open a position and hope for the best. Buying based on gut feeling, selling on gut feeling. That’s gambling not trading.\n\nI get the biggest kick when I see my people after Friday close saying, “Shit...What am I gonna do now for 48 hours?”\n\nWell sir...You pull out crayons, draw some lines, look for opportunities. Add more layers to charts. Moving averages, bullish cross overs, RSI...It’s a treasure hunt.\n\nThis is the way. \n\nCheers.", "id": "mabmyk", "created_utc": 1616376862.0, "score": 5021, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 511, "comments": [{"body": "I didn't know what colour crayon to use and got stressed and smoked some apha at 9:25 so apha 25c", "score": 538, "replies": [{"body": "[removed]", "score": 161, "replies": [{"body": "TL;DR OP is not a financial advisor, that being said 🎢 📉🚀🚀🚀🚀🌑 🧻👐", "score": 29, "replies": [{"body": "So we’re going up downward to the moon with paper hands?", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "OP likes roller coasters; timed right they'll blast off to the moon.

I wouldn’t say the stock market is gambling like the lottery system. But ppl tend to let it become that way without realizing it. My first job was working at a gas station so I sold scratchers. I noticed many thought they had a system to winning and would bet on their system to work. But they never do, they always lose and think it just didn’t work this time. But some were smarter than others, they knew most of it was a game of odds. If someone had $100 to spend they would buy nothing more then scratchers worth $5 and their chances of winning back all their money was much higher than someone who blew all that money on just one scratcher worth $100 (these ppl were always the biggest idiots of them all, cus 9/10 times these were the ppl who believed in their systems religiously). This is how I see it with the stock market, the biggest losers are the ones who spend too much on one play thinking it’s gonna be the one that makes them a millionaire. There will always be exceptions but the odds are rarely in your favor. TA can be great but to a certain degree it begins to form the same thought pattern involved with gamblers who believe they have a system. TA can be a very useful tool but never risk so much money based on TA alone. And don’t sell it all as soon as you get in the red. That’s another factor. Emotions play a big factor in winners vs losers. Ppl should learn to separate emotions from rational thinking. It’s a skill worth learning and I believe these are the most successful ppl in general.

What's most important is that you fucking PICK ONE and then ALWAYS USE THAT.  Don't connect wicks to bodies.  As long as you're consistent then you'll get roughly the same information.  \n\n\nNext, and also important is that you need two points to make a line.  However, a line with only two points is meaningless.  I could draw like 30 goddamn channels in those charts and they would all tell me what I want them to tell me instead of what is actually happening and the only thing they'd all have in common is that they're all equally shit.  You need at least THREE touchpoints for a line to indicate a trend.  Also, whether your line goes between wicks or bodies, either of those two things can count as a touchpoint.  I personally use the candle bodies because they're easier to see after like 8 shots of whiskey, so I'll try to find a line that hits at least three candle bodies exactly.  If any wicks then also hit my line or any candle bodies go past it, that can still be useful information.  However, a line only tells you something useful if at least THREE THINGS touch that line.  The more touchpoints the better, so try to get as many as you can even if it puts the line somewhere that you don't like.    \n\n\nLast shit is to also look at other indicators besides just the fucking candles, especially volume.  If I find a triple-reverse hypercube pattern but the volume is way below average then it's fucking meaningless.  Similarly, if my triple-reverse hypercube is isometric but volume is 100x higher than in the past year, it's also meaningless because it's an outlier so ignore that shit when you're drawing lines.  Also you may not find a fucking line no matter how much whiskey you drink or how fat of a crayon you scribble with.  If you need to, draw shorter lines but draw more of them over time since there could by some sort of cyclic pattern or some shit but even then you might find precisely fuck-all.  Shit happens.

Alternatively, purchase 1000oz bars of silver at premiums under 5% to ride the rocket.\n\nQuick Bullets:\n\n* Silver will rise dramatically due to a fundamentals-based rally in industrial and monetary demand\n* A short squeeze in silver is on the precipice of occurring, and could add gasoline to a bonfire, current short interest is 513%\n* SLV is a scam, if you own it then sell and purchase PSLV (and the same goes for GLD, you can buy PHYS instead)\n* The banks that run the silver market have been labeled ‘criminal enterprises’ by the DOJ, for metals price manipulation, and these are the same banks entrusted with SLV/SIVR\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere are two types of bull markets in silver.  One is a fundamentals-based bull market, where silver is undervalued relative to industrial and monetary demand.  The second type of silver bull market is a short squeeze.  Both types of bull markets have occurred at different points in the past 60 years. However, the 1971-80 market in which the price of silver increased over 30x does was combination of both types of bull markets. \n\n**I believe we may be entering another silver bull market like the one that began in the fall of 1971, where both a short squeeze and fundamentals-based rally occur simultaneously.** \n\nSo what are these ‘smoke alarms’ I mentioned? \n\nI recently went digging through various data to try and quantify where we are in the silver bull/bear market cycle. \n\nI ended up creating an indicator that I like to call SMOEC, pronounced ‘smoke’.  \n\nThe components of the abbreviation come from the words Silver, Money supply, and Economy.\n\nLets look at the money supply relative to the economy, or GDP.  More specifically, if you look at the chart below, you will see the ratio of M3 Money supply to nominal GDP, monthly, from 1960 through 2020. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5yh58ntwguo61.png?width=852&format=png&auto=webp&s=0da878286af614bfa216734371b1b9c257726612\n\nWhen this ratio is rising, it means that the broad money supply (M3) is increasing faster than the economy, and when it is falling it means that the economy is growing faster than the money supply. \n\nOne thing that is very important when investing in any asset class, is the valuation that you enter the market at.  Silver is no different, but being a commodity rather than cash-flow producing asset, how does one value silver? It might not produce cash flows or pay dividends, but it does have a long history of being used as both money and as a monetary hedge, so this is the correct lense through which to examine the ‘valuation’ level of silver.  \n\nEnter the SMOEC indicator. The SMOEC indicator tells you when silver is generationally undervalued and sets off a ‘smoke alarm’ that is the signal to start buying.  In other words, SMOEC is a signal telling you when silver is about to smoke it up and get super high.  \n\nBelow, you will see a chart of the SMOEC indicator. SMOEC is calculated by dividing the monthly price of silver by the ratio shown above (M3/GDP). \n\nMore specifically it is: LN(Silver Price / (M3/Nominal GDP))\n\nBelow you will see a chart of the SMOEC level from January 1965 through March 2021.\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h6tfe4kvguo61.png?width=905&format=png&auto=webp&s=64a5e124ddf99608ab11470b0492fa9642553df2\n\nI want to bring your attention to the blue long-term trendline for SMOEC, and how it can be used to help indicate when investing in silver is likely a good idea. Essentially, when growth in money supply is faster than growth of the economy, AND silver has been underinvested in as an asset class long enough, the SMOEC alarm is triggered as it hits this blue line.  \n\nSince 1965, SMOEC has only touched this trendline three times.  \n\nThe first occurrence was in October 1971, where SMOEC bottomed at 0.79 and proceeded to increase 3.41 points over the next eight years to peak at 4.20 in February of 1980 (literally 420, I told you it was a sign silver was about to get high).  Silver rose from $1.31 to $36.13, or a 2,658% gain using the end of month values (the daily close trough to peak was even greater).  Over this same period, the S&P 500 returned only 67% with dividends reinvested.  Silver, a metal with no cash flows, outperformed equities by a multiple of 40x over this period of 8.5 years (neither return is adjusted for inflation).  This is partially due to the fact that the Hunt Brothers took delivery of so many contracts that it caused a short squeeze on top of the fundamentals-based rally.\n\nThe second time the SMOEC alarm was triggered was when SMOEC dropped to a ratio of 2.10 in November of 2001 and proceeded to increase 2.32 points over the next decade to peak at 4.42 in April of 2011.  Silver rose from $4.14 to $48.60, an increase of over 1000%, and this was during a ‘lost decade’ for equities.  The S&P 500 with dividends reinvested, returned only 41% in this 9.5-year period.  Silver outperformed equities by a multiple of 24x (neither figure adjusted for inflation).  There was no short squeeze involved in this bull market. \n\nOver the long term, it would be expected that cash flow producing assets would outperform silver, but over specific 8-10 year periods of time, silver can outperform other asset classes by many multiples.  And in a true hyperinflationary environment where currency collapse is occurring, silver drastically outperforms.  Just look at the Venezuelan stock market during their recent currency collapse.  Investors received gains in the millions of percentage points, but in real terms (inflation adjusted) they actually lost 94%. This is an example of a situation where silver would be a far better asset to own than equities. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/77j9noo9huo61.png?width=676&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c794b8d8b8e339ebeac5757add7cf7492a8949a\n\nI in no way think this is coming to the United States.  I do think inflation will rise, and the value of the dollar will fall, but it will be nothing even close to a currency collapse.  Fortunately for silver investors, a currency collapse isn’t necessary for silver to outperform equity returns by over 10x during the next decade. \n\nBack to SMOEC though:\n\nThe third time the SMOEC alarm was triggered was very recently in April of 2020 when it hit a level of 2.91.  Silver was priced at $14.96, at a time the money supply was and still is increasing at a historically high rate, combined with the previous decade’s massive underinvestment in Silver (coming off of the 2011 highs).  Starting in April 2020, silver has since risen to a SMOEC level of 3.37 as of March 2021.  Silver is 0.46 points into a rally that I think could mirror the 1970s and push silver’s SMOEC level up by over 3.4 points once again.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nRemember that this indicator is on a LN scale, where each point is actually an exponential increase in the price of silver.  Here is a chart to help you mentally digest what the price of silver would be at various SMOEC level and M3/GDP combinations.  (LN scale because silver is nature’s money, so it just felt right)\n\nThe yellow highlighted box is where silver was in April of 2020 and the blue highlighted box is close to where it is as of March 2021.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9ifpvs0nhuo61.png?width=644&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b93f28cee346f858fcb50edb3ce1981faf010cf\n\n**An increase of 3.4 points from the bottom in in April of 2020 would mean a silver price of over $500 an ounce before this decade is out.  And there’s really no reason it must stop there.**  \n\nThe recent money supply growth has been extreme, and as the US government continues to implement MMT related policies with massive debt driven deficits, it is expected that monetary expansion will continue.  This is why bonds and have been selling off recently, and why yields are soaring.  Long term treasuries just experienced their first bear market since 1980 (a drop of 20% or more).  The 40-year bull market bond streak just ended.  What was the situation like the last time bonds had a bear market? Massively higher inflation and precious metals prices. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ziw7ob5phuo61.png?width=864&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d02a7db92e2325c8ae8c5ab7450f6c682d04d90\n\nThis inflation expectation is showing up in surging breakeven inflation rates.  And this trend is showing very little sign of letting up, just look at the 5-year expected inflation rate:\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dyp2056qhuo61.png?width=618&format=png&auto=webp&s=1aa926d50b73015ff6106b64c546d79c60369ec6\n\nInflation expectations are rising because we are actually starting to put money into the hands of real people rather than simply adding to bank reserves through QE. Stimulus checks, higher unemployment benefits, child tax credit expansion, PPP grants, deferral of loan payments, and likely some outright debt forgiveness soon as well. Whether or not you agree with these programs is irrelevant.  They are not funded by increased taxes, they are funded through debt and money creation financed by the fed.  As structural unemployment remains high (low unemployment is a fed mandate), I don’t see these programs letting up, and in fact I would be betting that further social safety net expansion is on the way. The $1.9 trillion bill was just passed, and it’s rumored the upcoming ‘infrastructure’ bill is going to be between $3-4 trillion.\n\nThis is the trap that the fed finds itself in.  Inflation expectations are pushing yields higher, but the nation’s debt levels (public and private) have expanded so much that raising rates would crush the nation fiscally through higher interest payments. Raising rates would also likely increase unemployment in the short run, during a time that unemployment is already high.  So they won’t raise rates to stop inflation because the costs of doing so are more unpalatable than the inflation itself.  They will keep short term rates at 0%, and begin to implement yield curve control where they put a cap on long term yields (as was done in the 1940s, the only other time debt levels were this high).  So where does the air come out of this bubble, if the fed can’t raise rates at a time of expanding inflation?  The value of the dollar.  We will see a much lower dollar in terms of the goods it can buy, and likely in terms of other currencies as well (depending on how much money creation they perform). \n\nThe other problem with the fed’s policy of keeping rates low for extended durations of time (like has been the case since 2008), is that it actually breeds higher structural unemployment.  In the short term, unemployment is impacted by interest rate shifts, but in the longer-term lower interest rates decrease the number of jobs available. Every company would like to fire as many people as possible to cut costs, and when they brag about creating jobs, know that the decision was never about jobs, but rather that jobs are a byproduct of expansion and are used as a bargaining chip to secure favorable tax credits and subsidies.  Recently, the best way to get rid of workers is through automation. \n\nRobotics and AI are advancing rapidly and can increasingly be used to completely replace workers. The debate every company has is whether its worth paying a worker $40k every year or buying a robot that costs $200k up front and $5k a year to do that job.  The reason they would buy the robot is because after so many years, there comes a point where the company will have saved money by doing so, because it is only paying $5k a year in up-keep versus $40k a year in salary and benefits. The cost of buying the robot is that it likely requires financing to pay that high of a price up front. In this situation, at 10% interest rates, the breakeven point for buying the robot versus employing a human is roughly 8 years.  At 2% interest rates though, the breakeven investment timeline for purchasing the robot is only 4 years. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe business environment is uncertain, and deciding to purchase a robot with the thought that it will pay off starting 8 years from now is much riskier than making a decision that will pay off starting only 4 years from now.  This trade off between employing people versus robots and AI is only becoming clearer too.  Inflation puts natural upward pressure on wages, governments are mandating higher minimum wages are costlier benefits as well.  There’s also the rising cost of healthcare that employers provide as well.  Meanwhile the costs of robotics and AI are plummeting.  The equation is tipped evermore towards capital versus labor, and the fed exacerbates this trend by ensuring the cost of capital is as low as possible via low interest rates. \n\nOn top of the automation trend, low interest rates drive mergers and acquisitions which also drive higher structural unemployment. In an industry with 3 competitors, the trend for the last 40 years has been for one massive corporation to simply purchase its competitor and fire half the workers (you don’t need 2 accounting departments after all).  How can one $50 billion corporation afford to borrow $45 billion to purchase its massive competitor? Because long term low interest rates allow it to borrow the money in a way that the interest payments are affordable.  Lacking competitive pressures, the industry now stagnates in terms of innovation which hurts long term growth in both wages and employment. Of course, our absolutely spineless anti-trust enforcement is partially to blame for this issue as well. \n\nThe fed is keeping interest rates low over long periods of time to help fix unemployment, when in reality low interest rates exacerbate unemployment and income inequality (execs get higher pay when they do layoffs and when they acquire competitors).  **The fed’s solution to the problem is contributing to making the problem larger, and they’ll keep giving us more of the solution until the problem is fixed.**  And as structural unemployment continues, universal basic income and other social safety net policies will expand, funded by debt. Excess debt then further encourages the fed to keep interest rates low, because who wants to cut off benefits to people in need?  And then low long term interest rates create more unemployment and more need for the safety nets. It’s a vicious cycle, but one that is extremely positive for the price of precious metals, especially silver. \n\nAnd guess what expensive robotics, electric vehicles, satellites, rockets, medical imaging tech, solar panels, and a bevy of other fast-growing technologies utilize as an input?  Silver. Silver’s industrial demand is driven by the fact that compared to other elements it is the best conductor of electricity, its highly reflective, and it extremely durable.  So, encouraging more capital investment in these industries via green government mandates and via low interest rates only drives demand for silver further. \n\nOne might wonder how with high unemployment we can actually get inflation. Well government is more than replacing lost income so far, just take a look at how disposable income has trended during this time of high unemployment. It’s also notable that all of the political momentum is in the direction of increasing incomes through government programs even further.\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1lh1uc7shuo61.png?width=864&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e7173278d6cf25987cf42ca93fd64caeed499c2\n\nThe spark of inflation is what ignites rallies in precious metals like silver, and these rallies typically extend far beyond what the inflation rates would justify on their own. This is because precious metals are insurance against fiat collapse. People don’t worry about fiat insurance when inflation is low, but when inflation rises it becomes very relevant at a time that there isn’t much capacity to satisfy the surge in demand for this insurance. Sure, inflation might only peak at 5% or 10% and while silver rises 100%, but if things spiral out of control its worth paying for silver even after a big rally, because the equities you hold aren’t going to be worth much in real terms if the wheels truly came off the wagon.  The Venezuela example proves that fact, but even during the 1970s equities had negative real rates of return and the US never had hyperinflation, just high inflation. \n\nDuring these times of higher inflation, holders of PMs aren’t necessarily expecting a fiat collapse, they just want 1%, 5%, or even 10% of their portfolio to be allocated to holding gold and silver as a hedge. During the 40-year bond bull market of decreasing inflation this portfolio allocation to precious metals lost favor, and virtually no one has it any longer.  I can guarantee most people don’t even have the options of buying gold or silver in their 401ks, let alone actually owning any.  The move back into having even a small precious metals allocation it is what drives silver up by 30x or more. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow it is time to dive deeper into the other contributor to the silver bull market, **the short squeeze.**  \n\nThere are plenty of banks talking about a commodities super cycle, and a ‘green’ commodity super cycle where they upgrade metals like copper, but they never mention silver. Likely because banks have a massive net short position in silver. \n\nLets dig into the silver squeeze, starting with the silver market itself. \n\nSilver is priced in the futures market, and its price is based on 1000oz commercial bars. A futures market allows buyers and sellers of a commodity to come to agreement on a price for a specific amount of that commodity at a specific date in the future. Most buyers in the futures market are speculators rather than entities who actually want to take delivery of the commodity.  So once their contract date nears, they close out their contracts and ‘roll’ them over to a future date.  Historically, only a tiny percentage of the longs take delivery, but the existence of this ability to take delivery is what gives these markets their legitimacy. If the right to take delivery didn’t exist, then the market wouldn’t be a true market for silver.  Delivery is what keeps the price anchored to reality. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIndustrial players and large-scale investors who want to acquire large amounts of physical silver don’t typically do it through the futures market.  They instead use primary dealers who operate outside of the futures market, because taking delivery of futures is actually a massive pain in the ass.  They only do it if they really have to.  Deliveries only surge in the futures market when supply is so tight that silver from the primary dealers starts to be priced at a large premium to the futures price, thus incentivizing taking delivery.  Despite setting the index price for the entire silver market, the futures exchange is really more of a supplier of last resort than a main player in the physical market. \n\nMost shorts (the sellers) in the futures market also source their silver from sources outside of exchange warehouses for the occasional times they are called to deliver.  The COMEX has an inventory of ‘registered’ silver that is effectively a big pile of silver that exists as a last resort source to meet delivery demand if supply ever gets very tight.  But even as deliveries are made each month, you will typically see next to no movement among the registered silver because silver is still available to source from primary dealers. \n\nSo how have deliveries and registered ounces been trending recently? \n\nLet’s take a quick look at the first quarter deliveries in 2021 compared to the first quarter in previous years:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3o4eda0zhuo61.png?width=669&format=png&auto=webp&s=5212d0ec99fa8fadc3e87d7d97da0327f9bd9a06\n\nAfter adding in the 3.6 million ounces of open interest remaining in the current March contract (anyone holding this late in the month is taking delivery), 1Q 2021 would reach 78 million ounces delivered.  This is a massive increase relative to previous years, and also an all-time record for Q1 from the data that I can find. \n\nEven more stark, is the chart showing deliveries on a 12-month trailing basis. \n\nNote: You have to view this on an annual basis because the futures market has 5 main delivery months and 7 less active months, so using a shorter time frame would involve cutting out an unequal share of the 5 primary months depending on what time of year it is. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y0zbsru0iuo61.png?width=724&format=png&auto=webp&s=db5619336c219421bc93c10be859dd581814fdb7\n\nAs you can see from the chart, starting in the month of April 2020, deliveries have gone completely parabolic.  While silver doesn’t need deliveries to spike for a rally to occur, a spike in deliveries is the primary ingredient for a short squeeze.  The 2001-2011 rally didn’t involve a short squeeze for example, so it ‘only’ caused silver to rise 10x.  In the 2020s however, we have a fundamentals-based rally that is running headlong into a surge in deliveries that is extremely close to triggering a short squeeze.  \n\nIn fact this is visible when looking at the chart of inventories at the COMEX. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0wd4lwgqkuo61.png?width=827&format=png&auto=webp&s=1bf26d8204bc0817457ebe56a6354ba7ede4ad8e\n\nAs you can see from the graph and the chart above, COMEX inventories are beginning to decline at a rapid pace. To explain a bit further, the ‘eligible’ category of COMEX is silver that has moved from registered status to delivered.  It is called ‘eligible’ because even though the ownership of the silver has transferred to the entity who requested delivery, they haven’t taken it out of the warehouse.  It is technically eligible become ‘registered’ if the owner decided to sell it. However, the fact that it is in the eligible category means that it would likely require higher silver prices for the owner to decide to sell. \n\nThe current path of silver in the futures market is that registered ounces are being delivered, they then become eligible, and entities are actually taking their eligible stocks out of COMEX warehouses and into the real physical world. This is a sign that the futures market is currently the silver supplier of last resort.  And there are only 127 million ounces left in the registered category. 1/3 of an ounce, or roughly $10 worth of silver is left in the supply of last resort for every American.  If just 1% of Americans purchased $1,000 worth of the PSLV ETF, it would be equivalent to 127 million ounces of silver, the entire registered inventory of the COMEX.  That’s how tight this market is. \n\nRight now we are sending most Americans a $1,400 check.  If 1% of them converted it to silver through PSLV, this market could truly explode higher. \n\nAnd lest you think this surge in deliveries is going to stop any time soon, just take a look at how the April contract’s open interest is trending at a record high level:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/knr5kwz7iuo61.png?width=779&format=png&auto=webp&s=c07edc45ea6d245cb58ff972cc93b847861d6c6e\n\nIt looks almost unreal.  And keep in mind the other high points in this chart were records unto themselves.  That light brown line was February 2021, and look how its deliveries compared to previous years:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pf93niaaiuo61.png?width=480&format=png&auto=webp&s=4835e10de33e28790f7c588858c883df25f44949\n\n12 million ounces were delivered in the month of February 2021. A month that is not a primary delivery month, and which exceeded previous year’s February totals by a multiple of 4x.  Open interest for February peaked at 8 million ounces, which means that an additional 4 million ounces were opened and delivered within the delivery window itself.  \n\nApril’s open interest is currently at a level of 15 million ounces and rising. If it followed a similar pattern to February of intra-month deliveries being added, it could potentially see deliveries of over 20 million ounces.  20 million ounces in a non-active month would be completely unheard of and is more than most primary delivery months used to see.   \n\nHere’s what 20 million ounces delivered in April would look like compared to previous years:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9qehkardiuo61.png?width=478&format=png&auto=webp&s=eeeaccab17039c03f9b8214dabfce7dea377ea18\n\nSo just how tenuous is the situation that the shorts have put themselves in (yes CFTC, the shorts did this to themselves)?  Well let’s look at the next active delivery month of May:\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1lgflbrhiuo61.png?width=860&format=png&auto=webp&s=a84d4fe485a9a5a0cafeb7e6d8a40f99a88049a0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j3u861k0juo61.png?width=271&format=png&auto=webp&s=eee4cc550f8b790a913f7ce073ae9afe8e6f5230\n\nIf a larger percentage than usual take delivery in May, there is easily enough open interest to cause a true run on silver. With 127 million ounces in the registered category, and 652 million ounces in the money, most of it from futures rather than options, the short interest as a % of the float is roughly 513%.  Its simply a matter of whether the longs decide to call the bluff of the shorts.  \n\nNo long contract holder wants to be left holding the last contract when the COMEX declares ‘force majeure’ and defaults on its delivery obligations.  This means that they will be settled in cash rather than silver, and won’t get to participate in the further upside of the move right when its likely going parabolic.  As registered inventories dwindle, longs are incentivized to take physical delivery just so that they can guarantee they will be able to remain long silver.  \n\nOf course, the COMEX could always prevent a default by simply allowing silver to continue trading higher. There is always silver available if the price is high enough.  Like the situation with GameStop, the authorities have historically tended to interfere with the silver market during previous short squeezes where longs begin to take delivery in large quantities.  \n\nThere were always shares of GME available to purchase, it’s just that the price had not reached what the longs were demanding quite yet. Given that it was the powerful connected elite of society who were short GME though, the trade was shut down and rigged against the millions of retail traders.  The GME short squeeze may indeed return, because in this situation it’s millions of small individuals holding GME. While they were able to temporarily prevent purchases of GME, they can’t force them to sell. \n\nIn the silver short squeeze of the 1970s, that’s exactly what the authorities forced the Hunt Brothers (the duo that orchestrated the squeeze) to do, [they forced them to sell](https://www.businessinsider.com/hunt-brothers-trying-to-corner-silver-market-2016-5).  The difference this time is that it’s not a squeeze orchestrated by a single entity, but rather millions of individuals who are purchasing silver.  There is no collusion on the long side among a small group of actors like in the 70s with the Hunt brothers or when Warren Buffet squeezed silver in the late 90s, so there’s no basis to stop the squeeze.  \n\nThe regulators literally pulled a ‘GameStop’ on the silver market.  Or in reality, the more recent action with GameStop was regulators pulling a ‘silver’.  The regulators will try everything in their power to prevent the squeeze from happening again, but this time it’s not two brothers and a couple of Saudi princes buying millions of ounces each (or just Warren Buffet on his own), but rather it’s millions of retail investors buying a few ounces each.  There is no cornering the market going on.  This is actual silver demand running headlong into a silver market that banks have irresponsibly shorted to such a level that they deserve the losses that hit them.  They’ve been manipulating and toying with silver investors for decades and profiting off of illegal collusion.  Bailing out the banks as their losses pile up would be truly reprehensible action by our government, and tacit admission that our government is ok with a few big banks on the short side stealing billions from small individual investors. \n\nSo what are these games of manipulation that the banks have played? \n\n**The general theme could be described as this: If banks hold the silver, the price is allowed to rise, but if you hold the silver, the price is forced to fall.** – Unless their bluff is truly called, and short squeeze occurs. Which means that the paper supply (contract silver that exists in the form of short futures contracts) has to be bought back at far higher prices to prevent further margin calls and possible insolvency. \n\nWhen the silver squeeze began in late January, there was a flurry of media interviews and articles by experts who claimed that a retail driven short squeeze just isn’t possible.  Why were they so confident? Because the banks have owned this game since futures began trading, and retail buyers don’t purchase 1000oz bars, they tend to purchase 1oz coins.\n\nThese small unit coins and bars are produced by mints both public and private.  These mints take 1000oz bars and use them to produce smaller silver bars and coins, but there is a limit to their production capacity. In normal times a mint might produce 5 million ounces a year, and in a time like today when demand is surging maybe they run the machines 24 hours a day and pump that production up to 10 million ounces in a year.  Does this add to demand for 1000oz bars? Yes, but the amount that it can add is capped at the production capacity of the mints.  Beyond the amount production can be ramped up, demand simply pushes premiums for these small units of silver higher, rather than the price of silver itself.  The large banks who are short 1000oz bars know that demand from this channel is capped, and thus they feel perfectly safe remaining in, or even increasing their short positions when retail coin and bar demand surges. \n\nOnce small unit silver premiums soar, the next place retail investors start to place money is in silver ETFs, primarily the SLV ETF.  This is where the real fucking over of retail silver investors starts. \n\nJeff Currie from Goldman had an interview on February 4th where he dismissed the idea of a silver short squeeze, and he had one line that was especially profound,\n\n“In terms of thinking how are you going to create a squeeze, the shorts are the ETFs, the ETFs buy the physical, they turn around and sell on the COMEX.” – Jeff Currie of Goldman\n\nThis was shocking to holders of SLV, because SLV is a long-only silver ETF. They simply buy silver as inflows occur and keep that silver in a vault.  They have no price risk, if the price of silver declines, it’s the investors who lose money, not the ETF itself so there is no need to hedge by shorting on the COMEX.  Further, their prospectus prohibits them from participating in the futures market at all.  So how is the ETF shorting silver?\n\nThey aren’t.  The iShares SLV ETF is not shorting silver, its custodian, JP Morgan is shorting silver. This is what Jeff Currie meant when he said the shorts are the ETFs.  Moreover, he said it with a tone like this fact should be plainly obvious to all of the dumb retail investors.  He truly meant what he said. \n\nWhat is a custodian you ask? The custodian of the ETF is the entity that actually buys, sells, and stores the silver. All iShares does is market the ETF and collect the fees. When money comes in they notify their custodian and their custodian sends them an updated list of silver bars that are allocated to the ETF. \n\nBut no real open market purchases of silver are occurring.  Instead, JPM (and a few sub custodian banks) accumulated a large amount of silver, segmented it off into LBMA vaults, and simply trade back and forth with the ETFs as they receive inflows.  **Thus, ensuring that ETF inflows never actually impact the true open market trade of silver.**  When the SLV receives inflows, JPM sells silver from the segmented off vaults, and then proceeds to short silver on the futures exchange.  As the price drops, silver investors become disheartened and sell their SLV, thus selling the silver back to JPM at a lower price.  It’s a continuous scalp trade that nets JPM and the banks billions in profits.  Here’s a diagram to help you sort it out: \n\n \n\n[Reduce, reuse, recycle](https://preview.redd.it/b8patrd4juo61.png?width=864&format=png&auto=webp&s=733303b57df19c5133ea50432dc6068640b543a0)\n\nAn even more clear admission that SLV doesn’t impact the real silver market came on February 3rd when it changed its prospectus to state that it might not be possible to acquire additional silver in the near future.  What does this even mean?  Why would it not be possible to acquire additional silver? As long as the ETF is willing to pay a higher price, more silver will be available to purchase. But if the ETF doesn’t participate in the real silver market, that’s actually not the case.  What SLV was admitting here, was that the silver in the JPM segmented off vaults might run out, and that they refuse to bid up the price of silver in the open market.  They will not purchase silver to accumulate additional inflows, beyond what JPM will allow them to. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you are purchasing SLV thinking you are purchasing silver on the open market, you could not be more wrong.  **Purchasing SLV is the best way for a silver investor to shoot themselves directly in the face.** \n\nThe real issue here is that purchasing SLV doesn’t actually impact the market price of silver one bit. The price is determined completely separately on the futures exchange.  SLV doesn’t purchase futures contracts and then take delivery of silver, it just uses JPM as a custodian who allocates more silver to their vault from an existing, controlled supply. This is an extremely strange phenomenon in markets, and its unnatural. \n\nFor example, when millions of people buy Tesla stock, it puts a direct bid under the price of the stock, causing the price to rise. \n\nWhen millions of people put money into the USO oil ETF, that fund then purchases oil futures contracts directly, which puts a bid under the price of oil.\n\nBut when millions of people buy SLV, it does nothing at all to directly impact the price of silver. The price of silver is determined separately, and SLV is completely in the position of price taker. \n\nSo how do we know banks like JPM are shorting on the futures market whenever SLV experiences inflows?  Well luckily for us the CFTC publishes the ‘bank participation report’ which shows exactly how banks are positioned on the futures market.\n\nThe chart below shows SLV YoY change in shares outstanding which are evidence of inflows and outflows to the ETF.  The orange line is the net short position of all banks participating in the silver futures market.  The series runs from April-2007 through February-2021.  I use a 12M trailing avg of the banks’ net position to smooth out the awkward lumpiness caused by the fact that futures have 5 primary delivery months per year, and this causes cyclicality in the level of open interest depending on time of year.\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vydektr6juo61.png?width=849&format=png&auto=webp&s=a68f0678d992f1c30c33a84436034dbabe133f8d\n\nIt is evident that as SLV experiences inflows, banks add to short positions on the COMEX, and as SLV experiences outflows they reduce these short positions.  What’s also evident is that the short interest of the banks has grown over time, which is also why silver is ripe for a potential short squeeze. \n\nOne other thing that is evident, is that the trend of banks shorting when SLV receives inflows, is starting to break down. Specifically, beginning in the summer of 2020, as deliveries began to surge, the net short interest among banks has actually declined as SLV has experienced inflows. It’s likely one or more banks see the risk, and the writing on the wall and is trying to exit before the squeeze happens. \n\nFor further evidence of this theme of, “If banks hold the silver, the price is allowed to rise, but if you hold the silver, the price is forced to fall” look no further than the deliveries data itself,\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r9jxmp28juo61.png?width=869&format=png&auto=webp&s=62bfcaa15c404d6e9be8425ea739265c17282b82\n\nYou’ll notice that as long as investors didn’t actually want the silver to be delivered, the price of silver was allowed to rise, but whenever deliveries showed and uptick, the price would begin to fall once again.  This is because the shorts know that they can decrease the price of all silver in the world by shorting on the COMEX, and then secure real physical silver from primary dealers to actually make delivery.  Why pay a higher price to the dealers when you can simply add to shorts on the COMEX and push the price down, and then acquire the silver you need? \n\nBut just like the graph of the bank net short position, you’ll notice that this relationship started to break down in 2020, and the price has started to rise alongside deliveries.  **The short squeeze is underway, and the dam is about to break.**  \n\nAnd lest you think I’m reaching with my accusations of price manipulation by JPM, why not just listen to what the department of Justice concluded?  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/igxaamq4luo61.png?width=877&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a66830bff69ec316cb2c49b5fb2de495777b608\n\nFor JPM and the banks involved in the silver market, fines from regulators are just a cost of doing business. The only way to get banks to stop manipulating precious metals markets is to call the bluff, take delivery, and make them feel the losses of their short position.  Silver is the best candidate for this to occur. \n\nSLV is by far the largest silver ETF in the world, with 600 million ounces of silver under its control, and its custodian was labeled a criminal enterprise for manipulation of silver markets.  Why should silver investors ever put their money into a silver ETF where the entity that controls the silver is actively working against them, or at a minimum is a criminal enterprise?\n\nAnd let me know if you see a trend in the custodial vaults of the other popular silver ETFs:\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ulkem3jbjuo61.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=8f30331fc8817bf081ce4b4fdf316a51765f1396\n\nFurther exacerbating the lack of trust one should have in these ETFs, is the fact that they store the metal at the LBMA in London. Unlike the COMEX that has regular independent audits, the LBMA isn’t required to have independent audits, nor do independent audits occur.  I’m not saying the silver isn’t there, but why not allow independent auditors in to provide more confidence? \n\nSo what are investors to do in a rigged game like this?  \n\nWell, there is currently one ETF that is outside this system, and which actually purchases silver on the open market as it receives inflows. That ETF is PSLV, from Sprott. Founded by Eric Sprott, a billionaire precious metals investor with a stake in nearly ever silver mine in the world, so you know his interests are aligned with the longs of the PSLV ETF (in desiring higher prices for silver via real price discovery).  Further, Sprott buys its silver directly, it doesn’t have a separate entity doing the purchasing, it stores its silver at the Royal Canadian Mint rather than the LBMA, and it is independently audited. By purchasing the PSLV ETF, retail investors can actually acquire 1000oz bars and put a bid under the price of silver in the primary dealer marketplace.  And if a premium occurs among primary dealers, deliveries will occur in the futures market.  This is what is starting to happen right now.  And this is happening after PSLV has added just 30 million ounces over 7 weeks.  Imagine what will happen if investors create 100 million ounces of demand.  \n\nEven a small portion of SLV investors switching to PSLV because they realize the custodian of SLV is a criminal enterprise, would create a massive groundswell of demand in the real physical silver market.  \n\nI’d highly recommend at least some allocation to physical silver through PSLV, and actual physical bars and coins (when premiums come down to earth) as soon as possible. If you are a large player and can take delivery on the COMEX that is easily the cheapest and best route to get exposure as well. \n\n**Alternate plays with more risk and potential reward include silver miners, silver miner ETFs, and call options on these silver stocks.** \n\n**Whatever you do, don’t buy any silver ETFs that aren’t PSLV.** \n\nSilver is about to ride a rocket to the moon, the banks will get what they deserve, screw the suits, retail investors deserve to win for once, whether its silver or GME.  It’s time the banks played by the rules of the system like the rest of us. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDisclaimers:  I am long PSLV and other silver plays.

When most people will want it is the time to trade it for either wads of cash, or - in case of calamity/hyperinflation, straight up barter for goods. It's a no-lose situation.\n\nHowever, premiums are already high due to a shortage in these products which is only set to get worse, so if you are a chicken (seriously premiums at THESE bargain prices don't matter):\n\nNo.2 buy: $PSLV - Eric Sprott's Physical Backed ETF. When it trades at a premium, they add shares, and thus silver to the vault. The difference with SLV is, silver doesn't leave, and they ONLY add shares if they can secure the physical to back it - they have virtually no unallocated silver. Their storage is also with the Canadian royal mint rather then JP Morgan, so more trustworthy, and they are audited. Price tracks the futures price, so compared to the premiums on coins (which reflect the REAL silver price - whether it's by metal shortage or production capacity shortage, products still are in short supply, with no guarantee they'll resupply before the industrial users panic), it's pretty much at a heavy discount currently.\n\nWhere to buy: Brokers that offer it. Can't give advice there, that'll depend on locale. But most should. Personally (The Netherlands) i use DeGiro where it's under the ETFs with the rest of em.\n\nThe reason you'd buy physical over PSLV is because of taking profits - should you do so during hyperinflation, you can only sell PSLV into the open market and take \\*cash\\* profits - which then rapidly start losing value, so it requires immediate reinvestment of some kind. \n\nBut this is more of a long term view at this point. Mostly predicated on the idea that, when you wanna rotate out of PSLV for real silver - you'll be doing it for the same reason most people will want physical, and it'll be unobtainable by then at any price, so you will want to have some physical before that moment in time, price be damned. \n\nI'd advise anyone with large amounts to buy some physical but mostly put it into PSLV anyway though.

SLV is not a fraud, it gives you a claim on silver held in a vault by a highly solvent counter-party, one that's bigger and safer than Sprott. \n\nYour argument is that buying SLV is counterproductive for pumping silver prices because you induce the counterparty to short an equal amount of silver to offset your long position. \n\nI am dubious of this. But even if you're right, that doesn't make it a scam. \n\nBut your point also makes little sense. JPM/ishares etc have no interest in taking automatic directional bets on silver. The way you write this, it sounds like someone automatically goes short silver when you go long buying SLV, but this doesn't happen with PSLV. \n\nThat makes no sense. Why would JPM decide to take a risky and dumb short silver just because retail decides to go long?\n\nSimilarly, you overstate the case for PSLV.

{"title": "How to Keep Your Newly Minted Title of Millionaire (2nd Edition)", "selftext": "*Preface: I previously posted this using my main account on WallStreetBets. However, since people in my life know my main account, I have decided to delete it in accordance to Part 1; Chapter 1:* ***Don't tell anyone****. That being said, I still wanted to help out as many of my friends here that I can, so I'm uploading this again on my alternative account. In the process, I have taken all of the feedback that I received in the first post, and have created the ultimate compilation of DD resources for your new financial life as a Millionaire. I hope this helps out my brothers and sisters here!*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, you did it. You did your due diligence, you did the math, you summoned your courage to press that 'Buy' button, and now those stocks and options have granted you a title you only dreamed of having.\n\n\"Millionaire\".\n\nCongratulations! You beat the odds that so many before you have failed to overcome. You played the game, and came out on top. Your thoughts are racing as you realize all that you can do with this newfound wealth. Now it's time to buy that house you always dreamed of, or that car you always wanted to drive, right? And now I can go on that luxury vacation to that resort I always wanted to go to! But, slowly, there may be this other feeling that washes over you.\n\nFear.\n\nSlowly, you feel a wrinkle form on your brain, as you begin to realize how big of a responsibility this truly is, and how unique of an opportunity this is. You know that you may only have this shot once, and don't want to screw it up. Well, if this community has shown us anything over these past 4 months or so, it's that knowledge is power! So fear not, my friends! For in the paragraphs ahead lie your survival guide for the next 6 months!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*\"What do you mean, a 'survival guide'?\"*\n\nThis guide will be broken into 3 parts. The first section contains life advice as for how to socially, and mentally handle these unprecedented funds. The second part **does not contain financial advice**, but rather the resources to do your own research, and figure out a financial plan that would benefit you the most. The reason being is that it would be irresponsible for me to tell you what to do with your money. Beyond that, every person here has a different story. Some folks may have a partner and 3 kids, while others my still be living at home. Instead, I would like to give you all the tools to build a successful life using these new funds. The third section goes over where to go from here now that you've built a solid foundation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*\"Ok, I understand what's in this guide, but why now? Why not after a squeeze?\"*\n\nGreat question! I considered posting it after a squeeze on a particular stock, but I realized that some everyday folks have already won big on well placed call options. If I can give at least one person pause to reflect, and help someone avoid making a huge mistake with their windfall...that would be enough. I'm by no means an expert, I'm just trying to look out for the people here.\n\nSo, without further ado, let us begin.\n\n\\-----\n\n# Part 1 - Social and Emotional Survival\n\nChapter 1\n\nProtecting it from everyone else\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**DON'T TELL ANYBODY.** If there is one thing you take away from this, let it be this. So let me repeat that...\n\n**DON'T.**\n\n**TELL.**\n\n**ANYONE.**\n\nThis is going to be your most well kept secret in your life. At least in the beginning. You will probably feel the urge to tell your friends, and your family, but doing this *WILL* ruin your life. Why? Well, first, people are going to find it harder to relate to you. Snide remarks such as, “look at Moneybags over here”, “must be nice”, or “remember the little guy”, may weed their ways into the conversations people have with you. You’ll see your relationships slowly change as people no longer relate to some of the things going on in your life. (Not everyone in your life is going to be worried about finding a tax advisor that specializes in the wealthy!)\n\nOn top of that, they’re gonna smell money, and many of them may want a cut.\n\nThey're gonna say they need that new device, or they need that new car, or they want to start this unusual business venture, or they need this or that. They'll bring up how far you go back. Suddenly, you'll see the very people who have been your friends, turn on you like vultures. They may think they have your best interests in mind, and they may not know the emotional and relationship damage they're causing, but they'll smell money, and they're gonna come asking.\n\nBy that point, you’ve lost. You’re stuck between a rock and a hard place. You may have to be the bad guy and say, “no”. And some of those relationships may quickly fall apart as you deny them. Or the alternative is that you're gonna bleed your money 'helping' everyone while they take advantage of you and indulge their overspending habits.\n\nThere's also the concern of your safety. People who are lottery winners are found to be much more likely to be a victim of kidnapping, blackmail and murder. That's not to say you can't live an upper middle class lifestyle, but be careful with how flashy and open you are with your earnings.\n\nTo put it differently, this isn't a question of who do you tell, because word spreads. Rather, this is a question of social survival. Do you want to maintain your relationship with your friends and family? Yes? Then keep it to yourself. Eventually, you may find people that you trust, and can let them in on the secret. But you can’t take back your words once you say them. Be very careful with who knows.\n\n*Money talks, but wealth whispers.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nChapter 2\n\nProtecting it from expenses\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you want this money to last more than 5 years, you're gonna want to treat it as if it wasn't there.\n\n*\"Wait, what? Then why do I have this money if I'm not gonna use it?!\"* You will use it. Just not as a sum of cash. If you have $1.8 million after taxes, you are not going to go out and buy a $1 million dollar house and a $200,000 Lamborghini. You'll only have $600,000 left! And while this may sound like a lot, it won't go nearly as far as you might think. Instead, you might want to turn to **FIRE**, or **Financial Independence, Retire Early.** There, you are going to use your newfound money as a *source of income.* I'll go over the details in Part 2; Chapter2, but for now, an easy equation for this is 4%. That's it. That's the equation. 4% of your net worth can be used yearly, while your money still sits in investments and accrues roughly 7% interest annually. This way you beat inflation, and you cover your expenses.\n\nSo, to use our $1.8 million under the 4% rule, that's *$72,000* you can spend annually, and in theory you will never run out of funds, while never working another day in your life if you don't want to. Or, if you enjoy what you're doing, you can add that to the equation as well. How you break it up is up to you, but you can very easily spend north of $100,000 a year, and still be in the green if you hold down a job.\n\nMeanwhile, let's check in on our $600,000. That's *$24,000* a year you can spend for the rest of your life if you wanted to retire today. That's uncomfortably close to the poverty line. You're a millionaire. You don't deserve that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nChapter 3\n\nProtecting it from yourself\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYes. Yourself. As quickly as you made your money, you can easily lose it in the best 2 weeks of your life. So right now, emotions are probably high. You're beyond excited, you are itching to do something crazy with your money, and probably want to buy something, since you can't tell anyone per Chapter 1. But I implore, please **don't buy anything right now.**\n\nYes, you read that right. Don't buy anything. If you need any proof on that, look up what happens to lottery winners. Roughly 35% of them go *bankrupt within 10 years of winning!* Rather, set the money aside for a while. You can determine this amount of time, but a good rule of thumb is 6 months. In those 6 months, it gives you plenty of time to calm yourself, collect your thoughts, and figure out an actual plan on how to wisely use that money. How you want to invest it, how much you want to use per year, and how much you owe in *taxes*. Yes. The dreaded, 't-word'. *Taxes*. You've gotta pay up. And during that planning process, you'll have to come to terms with what this money is going to do for your life.\n\n\\-----\n\n# Part 2 - Economic Survival\n\nChapter 1\n\nTaxes\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRoughly 40% of earnings over $500K is going to go to the federal government. That's not even accounting for any state income taxes (which vary wildly from state to state). And before we continue, I will allow a moment for a collective \"*ouch*\" from everyone reading.\n\nThat's a lot. I won't deny that. But as much as it sucks, you've gotta pay up. Because if you don't, the IRS can very, very easily take ALL of it. 100%. And they will, leaving you behind with nothing but lawyer and court fees, and no money to pay them. So please, please, please, make sure you pay the taxes my friends!\n\nWith that said, since you are a millionaire, you have the resources to retain the services of a CPA who specializes in the wealthy and ultra-wealthy. And I would highly advise doing your research and getting the best one you can find, as otherwise you may be overpaying by the thousands! Also, in compliance with Chapter 1; Part 1, please do not go to a family friend, or even someone in your area. If you can travel (or in the case of COVID, WebEx/Zoom) to a CPA out of your area, even better! Find someone based on quality, not convenience!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nChapter 2\n\nDebt\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you have any debt in your life, now would be the time to review that. Any high interest debt such as credit cards, car loans, personal loans, student loans, etc. I would advise paying off immediately. Otherwise, those interest rates will bleed you dry, and take away from your profits, and your attempt to be financially independent.\n\nNow, if you have a mortgage, this would be at your discretion. Some people advise paying off the house with the rest of the debt if you have the available capital to do so. This way it removes the last payment from your life. However, the alternative school of thought is that your money is going to earn more money in an investment than it will save in the interest when you pay the house off immediately. This again will be at your discretion. If you're planning on proceeding with FIRE (more details in Chapter 3), my personal recommendation would be to pay off the mortgage up front, so that you aren't putting a strain on your new income source.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nChapter 3\n\nFIRE\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFIRE, or Financial Independence Retire Early is a movement that has been gaining traction as of late, with the goal of making retirees out of 20-40 year olds. As mentioned above, the equation is simple. You take your net worth, and figure out what is 4% of it. So if you have $2 million dollars, 4% of that is $80,000. That means that you can live off $80,000 a year for the rest of your life without changing a thing, and be financially independent.\n\nNow, how exactly does this work? Well in the 90's, a man named Bill Bengen figured out that the worst case scenario for a rate of return from typical stock market investments year-over-year was 7%. So that means in theory, you can retire on your earnings and never touch the principle. Now, you can adjust this number as you see fit depending on your returns or any other streams of income, however for people trying to retire in their 20's, I would advise staying conservative with the 4% since this money needs to last you a lifetime. The other 3% is there to build the principle and protect it from inflation, which increases by 2%-3% annually.\n\nThis would be the standard FIRE. However, there are 4 other types of FIRE:\n\n* **Lean FIRE** \\- Living on less than you make, roughly $40,000 a year\n* **Fat FIRE** \\- Living a retirement of luxury, roughly between $100,000-$120,000 (double the standard household income in your area)\n* **Barista FIRE** \\- Using the same principles as above, but you are picking up a part time job or a gig job that you enjoy. This will supplement some of the money that you take out of your investments.\n* **Coast FIRE** \\- This last version is similar to Barista FIRE, however you use the power of compound interest to become financially independent later. You continue to work now, while your investments grow in the background. You don't need to add another cent to retirement as they will grow in the markets, however you are not financially independent today.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nChapter 3\n\nInvestments\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBefore I proceed, this is once again, NOT financial advice. Now, with that disclaimer out of the way...\n\nI believe the smartest thing you can do would be to invest in appreciating assets, rather than buy depreciating assets such as cars. These come in many forms (which I will cover below), but what ties them together is that they are all a source of income. Your money on it's own isn't generating additional money. But you are also in a unique position of not having to work for your money. *It's time to make your money work for you.*\n\n**Stock Market** \\- One of the most common sources of passive income is the stock market. For the sake of your financial future, I would not put most of your portfolio into single stocks. While I'm not saying avoid single stocks all together, I wouldn't invest more than 10% of your net worth into them. Any more than that carries the risk of severely crippling your retirement portfolio. Boring ETF's, bonds and mutual funds may be a safer play. I am obligated to advise you to do your research before making any decisions on what to invest in.\n\n**Real Estate** \\- Another popular investment is Real Estate. This comes in may forms, from flipping houses, to becoming a real estate agent, or buying rental properties. The benefits to the real estate market is that you are left with something. A hedge fund isn't able to come along and short your house into the ground. Your house is yours. If the stock market crashes, or a company goes under, you're at a loss. It's easier to ride out the waves with real estate. With it though, comes more work. You are now a landlord, and have to mange the properties, and find new tenants as the old ones move out. It's not as passive of an income as the Stock Market.\n\n**Businesses** \\- \"Small business is the backbone of our economy.\" While it seems to be every politicians catchphrase, they're not wrong. Small businesses are extremely important to the success of our nation, and you now have the capital to make your own. If you have something that you're really passionate about, I would fully endorse you going out and either buying a business, or building your own business for your passion from the ground up! However, this is much, much more work than the passive investments of the stock market.\n\n\\-----\n\n# Part 3 - What Comes Next?\n\nChapter 1\n\nSpending\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlright, so you've made it this far. Now, we're going to take all that we've learned, and form an action plan. First, the spending. Make sure you build a budget for your spending and track what leaves your accounts. Just because you're wealthy doesn't mean we can get sloppy! Remember, we're trying to keep you a millionaire! When it comes to spending, don't overextend yourself. If you want a life of financial independence, you will need to discipline yourself and stay within your means. This money has to last a lifetime after all! I would also advise that any further day trading that you do comes out of the annual funds available for spending (as calculated by the 4% rule). This way, if you make a risky options play, or a stock flounders, it won't hurt you long term! And remember, hold less than 10% of your net worth in single stocks!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nChapter 2\n\nBuilding a cabinet\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, if what I've said so far isn't resonating with you, and you would rather be walked through these major financial decisions, then I would advise assembling a committee that can help you through this. Whether you choose to rely on them for the short term as you get your feet wet, or the long term to ensure someone keeps you in check, will again be at your discretion. But before I proceed with my recommended positions for your financial committee, I will remind you that time is money. If you put the time in to learn the principles of personal finances, then it will save you a lot of money in the long term. That said, some people just want to set the money aside and forget about it, and that's ok too! For a fully staffed committee, I would recommend a financial advisor, a tax advisor/CPA, a real estate advisor (should you want to enter real estate), an attorney, and an insurance advisor.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nChapter 3\n\nGiving\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd now that you have a solid financial foundation to stand on, one that will be passed onto your kids, and possibly even your grandkids, we can begin to make the world a better place. You can now begin to give. Now, giving is a broad term in this sense. It can range anywhere from giving the valet a generous tip to park your shiny car, to donating $2500 to your local food bank just before Thanksgiving. But just like with spending, you want to make sure you don't overextend yourself. If you are a responsible steward with your money, you can ensure that you can help many more people for years to come. To do so, I would advise taking the money not out of your principle, but rather on your annually allotted funds.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nChapter 4\n\nSources for you to perform your own Due Diligence\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn this chapter, I have included some good sources to begin your own due diligence. While I don't necessarily agree with everything that they all say, it's up to you to find what works best for you!\n\n[How to survive winning the lottery - Reddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/24vo34/whats_the_happiest_5word_sentence_you_could_hear/chb4v05/) \\- An extremely detailed Reddit post describing how to survive winning the lottery.\n\n*Graham Stephan - YouTube* *:* Graham Stephan is a self-made millionaire who achieved financial independence in his 20's.

A starter guide on how to survive your first few months as a new millionaire, written by someone who has never been a millionaire! But I have seen some people make some awful mistakes regarding money, and did my due diligence on what happens after someone gains a massive windfall. And I have a feeling that more than a handful of you might be seeing a windfall come your way in the near future...\n\nTo close, they say money can't buy you happiness, but I'm often reminded of the scene from Captain America, where Steve is told, ***\"The serum amplifies everything that is inside. So, good becomes great. Bad becomes worse.\"***\n\nMoney is only going to amplify how you want to live your life. If you're happy now, you'll be even happier. If you're snobby now, you'll become even snobbier. If you want to live generously, leaving anonymous gifts and donations, giving all you have away, you can do that. If you want to live egregiously expensive and live it up, over spending at every turn, you can also do that. But you will need to face the consequences of all those decisions.\n\nAnd if you, in your nature, default to one of these paths, but don't want to, it will take all the more effort to avoid it than if you didn't have this money at all.\n\nOh who am I kidding.

These can haunt you if not taken care of. \n\nThen from there I would really ask yourself what you’re investing for. Is it for a nice home? To do right with your mother’s policy? These are all rhetorical questions you’ll have to figure out yourself. Once you know that, develop a plan to meet whatever long-term financial goals you may have. \n\nI know $500 is very minimal compared to what you have available, but I wouldn’t put anything in GME, or any volatile stock, unless you’re willing to lose it. No one can predict these things. Don’t let Internet people fool you into losing a good nest egg your mother left you.\n\nRegardless, I think you should be investing for the long-term here. We’re talking years and not a get rich quick scheme because that just won’t work. Over time though, you will amass a nice balance if you’re diversified, ride the waves of the market, and hold.\n\nI think your best options are Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). These are individual shares you can buy that are already extremely diversified across a given sector of the market and managed by firms who charge very tiny fees for you to own them. There’s some that mimic the Dow, the S&P 500, Nasdaq, etc. The returns of safe ETFs that mimic the market are very low risk and offer a decent return (10%+ per year). These are your best bet in my opinion. Your portfolio should be made up of mostly (75%) safe, broader market based ETFs. I would invest 20% in riskier ETFs that have historically been positive, but on a bigger return basis, so maybe 25%+ a year. The remaining 5% or less I would treat yourself to whatever you see fit. \n\nLosing a loved one can be rough and you deserve a nice vacation, new TV, etc. to help you take care of yourself mentally and physically.

Buy a total market, or S&P 500 index with all 12k (you can even set this to dollar cost average and buy 1000/month for example so the rest is still cash), set the dividends to reinvest, and sit on the rest cash in a regular brokerage account. This Roth IRA will grow tax free for many years to come and is money you cannot “touch” without a penalty until you are 59 1/2. There are a few exceptions like first time homebuyer, which you mentioned, in which you can withdraw penalty free. \n\nIf you have 6k still “waiting” in a cash account next calendar year you can contribute your 2022 funds. This money can grow exponentially over the years and you will never regret this decision. \n\nI don’t know if other subs can be plugged here, but r/Bogleheads is worth looking at.\n\nThere is a “rule of 72” where 72 divided by investment return percent is how long it takes that money to double. If the market averages 8% then in 9 years that 12 becomes 24, 9 more years 24 becomes 48 etc. compound interest is your friend. Don’t gamble, be smart.\n\nThis will sound contradictory to what I’ve suggested, but There are many ways to manage a windfall, which is what has happened to you. You need to take emotion out of your decisions and the best move short term is to do nothing. Let 6 months blow over and then return to this.

{"title": "[$AMRS] 🚀 🌕 THE ULTIMATE DD 🚀 🌕 DEEP LONG-TERM VALUE WITH MASSIVE NEAR-TERM CATALYSTS", "selftext": "*NOTE: NOTHING IN THIS POST IS FINANCIAL ADVICE*\n\n**EDIT: TLDR of TDLR:**\n\nHuge near-term catalysts for $AMRS. Large deals getting announced this week. Stock going to the moon. **Buying the stock and April 16 calls is the play.**\n\n**TLDR:**\n\nAmyris ($AMRS) is a synthetic biotechnology company that engineers, manufactures, and sells sustainably created ingredients and products. $AMRS’s proprietary technology has a near-endless number of applications and a staggering total addressable market potentially in the trillions of dollars. After a decade of heavily investing in R&D to advance their platform, both the company’s technology and business model recently turned the corner, laying the foundation for incredible value creation over near and long-term horizons. ***Within the next three trading days,*** ***$AMRS will announce the completion of two strategic transactions worth more than $500 million, sending the stock to the fucking moon.*** This is a deep value play, but for all you short squeeze junkies, $AMRS does happen to have relatively significant short interest at 16% of the float. I expect that the jump in price from $AMRS’s upcoming transaction announcements to dump gasoline onto a raging fire, sending the shorts to an early grave while raining tendies from the sky for the longs\n\n***The play – buying shares of the $AMRS stock or April 16 calls with strikes above $20***\n\n**MY POSITIONS:**\n\nI believe in this company over both long and short time horizons. See below for current positions.\n\n[Positions](https://preview.redd.it/b7u4okrgfup61.png?width=859&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d13644c0e3bae68378c1e440dc6fdcaaf5f412e)\n\n**BACKGROUND:**\n\nI was a relatively early investor in $ENPH, and after the success of that investment (sub $2 share price in 2018, now trading above $150 a share), I was looking to invest in a company with a similarly checkered past with a catalyst to turn the corner quickly. As with $ENPH, the company needed to have invaluable technology with the potential for huge near-term gains to compensate for the risk. I couldn’t have been more elated discovering $AMRS, which checked all the boxes. $AMRS has performed well this year so far, but we are light-years away from the company’s potential both over the short and long term\n\n**$AMRS BUSINESS:**\n\nThis business is complicated, but I’ll do my best to summarize some key points. Founded by a group of Berkley scientists, $AMRS is a synthetic biotechnology company that engineers, manufactures, and sells sustainably created ingredients and products into several markets, including Health & Wellness, Clean Beauty, and Flavor & Fragrance. Within Health & Wellness, $AMRS focuses on alternative sweeteners, vitamins, and food ingredients. In Flavor & Fragrance, $AMRS produces natural oils and aroma chemicals for a range of applications. In Clean Beauty, $AMRS focuses on clean skincare and cosmetic ingredients. For all you tree huggers, their production and products are totally sustainable, and by creating otherwise naturally occurring molecules in the lab, $AMRS saves the destruction of animals and other natural resources (as an example, they produce a skin-care molecule called squalene that otherwise requires killing sharks to get it)\n\n$AMRS generates revenue from a combination of a partnership model and a wholly-owned direct model\n\nIn the partnership model, $AMRS creates a molecule/ingredient in the lab and scales it on a commercial level on behalf of a partner, who then uses the molecule/ingredient in one of its products, which the partner markets and sells to its own customers. $AMRS captures revenues from producing and selling the molecule/ingredient to the partner + $AMRS receives royalties from the partner’s product sales that contain the ingredient created by $AMRS. $AMRS has many commercial, industrial level partners including Firmenich, Givaudan, DSM, Yifan, the US Department of Energy, and DARPA. On the retail side, $AMRS has recently announced partnerships to create new brands such as [JVN](https://investors.amyris.com/2021-01-11-Amyris-Creates-Partnership-With-Jonathan-Van-Ness-To-Launch-Leading-Clean-Haircare-Brand) (Johnathan Van Ness clean haircare brand launching Summer 2021), [Rose Inc](https://investors.amyris.com/2020-10-30-Amyris-And-Rosie-Huntington-Whiteley-Announce-Creation-Of-New-Clean-Beauty-Brand-And-Business-Partnership) (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley high-end cosmetics brand launching 3Q 2021), and most recently, they announced a partnership with [Minerva](https://investors.amyris.com/2021-03-16-Amyris-Enters-Partnership-With-Minerva-Foods-For-Zero-Carbon-Protein-Production) (focusing on zero carbon protein production)\n\nIn the wholly-owned direct model, $AMRS sells its developed ingredients through brands that $AMRS currently owns, including [Biossance](https://biossance.com/) (high-end skincare), [Pipette](https://pipettebaby.com/) (skincare for babies), [Purecane](https://purecane.com/) (synthetic sugar similar to Splenda) as well as brands it has recently acquired, such as [Teresana](https://investors.amyris.com/2021-01-22-Amyris-Acquiring-Terasana-Brand-To-Offer-Clean-Cannabinoid-Consumer-Products) (sustainably sourced cannabinoids launching Q2 2021), and [Costa Brazil](https://investors.amyris.com/2021-03-01-Amyris-Acquiring-Costa-Brazil-Clean-Beauty-Brand-Francisco-Costa-To-Join-Amyris-As-Chief-Creative-Officer) (clean luxury skincare acquired in Q1 2021). Separately, the company has also recently [made headway using its technology in the production of RNA for use in MRNA vaccines](https://investors.amyris.com/2021-02-22-Amyris-Announces-Positive-Pre-Clinical-Results-For-COVID-19-RNA-Vaccine-Platform-With-Advantaged-Manufacturing-Storage-And-Distribution-Characteristics), though this is in its early stages\n\n$AMRS’s consumer brands are distributed through many high-profile channels, including Amazon, Target, Walmart, and Sephora in addition to their own direct-to-consumer websites. **It is no surprise that they have demonstrated ridiculous revenue growth of 197% in 2020 alone**\n\n[4Q 2020 Earnings Investor Presentation](https://preview.redd.it/0i2sigct5up61.png?width=1693&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5adddb33f2fba374819bb1a7978567d539de69d)\n\n[4Q 2020 Earnings Investor Presentation](https://preview.redd.it/elg9yw6i7up61.png?width=1723&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6aa48fdd57967c48d2474a2db7975fde4f63e98)\n\n**NOTABLE RECENT INVESTORS:**\n\nNo doubt, $AMRS’s progress has captured the attention of some incredibly famous investors, the most notable being the billionaire venture capitalist John Doerr, whose current portfolio of investments includes Alphabet/Google (where his investment is worth over $2.2 billion alone), DoorDash, Bloom Energy, Quantamscape, and of course, Amyris ($AMRS), where his investment is worth about $70,000,000. Doerr currently serves on the Board of Directors at Google and $AMRS and previously served on the board of Amazon\n\n[John Doerr Ownership \\/ Other Investments](https://preview.redd.it/zq3bts856up61.png?width=527&format=png&auto=webp&s=21ac19937f3e728e1761e8b26a513ce6b35f0138)\n\n**SHORT INTEREST:**\n\nAs shown in the below ownership statistics, over 16% of $AMRS’s tradable float is sold short, which amounts to approximately 21.7 million shares as of 3/26/2021. With a 90-day average daily trading volume of just 4.9 million shares and just 2.3 million shares traded last Friday (3/26), I suspect that when the company delivers on its upcoming transactions this week, trading volumes will increase from intense buying. A rising share price will put tremendous pressure on short sellers to cover their positions, leading to a classic short squeeze and an increased pop in the stock\n\n[Source: FactSet](https://preview.redd.it/zaj7ak6l6up61.png?width=341&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee15407674b13c2d45207fde230d9654f18f54ff)\n\n**UPCOMING TRANSACTION ANNOUNCEMENTS / NEAR-TERM CATALYSTS:**\n\nBeginning last November, $AMRS began discussing a series of three upcoming strategic transactions that have truly changed the game for the company. Each transaction is different, but effectively involve the monetization of a molecule/ingredient whereby a partner pays $AMRS a significant upfront cash payment as well as licensing fees / royalties over a multi-year period. **The significance of these transactions cannot be understated as they provide cash to the business while creating recurring revenue streams. In effect, these deals allow $AMRS to self-fund its business without diluting existing investors from new equity offerings or extremely expensive debt. This is what the market has been craving**\n\nThe first of the three closed last December with a transaction value of just [$50 million](https://investors.amyris.com/2020-12-21-Amyris-Closes-50-Million-Strategic-Transaction) and the stock has flying ever since, gaining over 200% so far this year. **The remaining two transactions are set to close within the next three days with an expected total value of over $500 million for JUST ONE OF THE TWO TRANSACTIONS**\n\nHere is the CEO on the 4Q 2020 earnings call dated March 3, 2021:\n\n[4Q 2020 Earnings Transcript, dated March 2, 2021](https://preview.redd.it/w4mhtjjv6up61.png?width=1259&format=png&auto=webp&s=0be49c2e03f7fb240f5b05c77cdc79574078d6ba)\n\nThe CEO re-affirmed that the transactions will close prior to the end of the first quarter several times thereafter, including an industry conferences on 3/4 (Cowen) and 3/15 (Roth) [as well as quietly in the last sentence of an unrelated press release on 3/25](https://investors.amyris.com/2021-03-25-Amyris-Delivers-Record-Production-Of-CBG-For-Consumer-Skincare-Formulations)\n\nTo those that would argue it is already priced in - you are wrong for several reasons. First, this company has almost no intuitional coverage and is paid very little attention relative to more established biotechnology companies. Said differently, the institutions that really set valuation and move the stock don't care enough yet to pay attention. But they will. $AMRS's investor base only continues to expand as more people wake up to it's incredible potential. Second, prior to the recent turnaround, the company overpromised a few times, just as companies that later mooned like $ENPH did. It happens, particularly with early stage companies. So even in the \"efficient market\" fantasy world, the company's public disclosures would have a credibility discount, leaving substantial upside for investors today when the company inevitably delivers\n\n**CONCLUSION:**\n\nThese strategic transactions will announce by no later than Thursday morning (4/1), and $AMRS will be off to the fucking races. For some context, the suits at HC Wainwright and Roth Capital Partners currently have price targets of $33 and $35. I like the stock, and I think it is worth even more\n\n***The play: $AMRS shares + April 16 calls with strikes $20 and above***\n\nGood luck and godspeed", "id": "mfc86c", "created_utc": 1616972468.0, "score": 1296, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 588, "comments": [{"body": "Ok buying this because i love ASMR videos", "score": 592, "replies": [{"body": "This is the quintessential WSB comment", "score": 195, "replies": []}, {"body": "ASMR, should I google this at work?", "score": 51, "replies": [{"body": "Actually safe for work.", "score": 45, "replies": [{"body": "Well, sometimes.", "score": 43, "replies": [{"body": "Anime onee-chan licks your ears intensifies", "score": 13, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "It’s weird.

So given two alternatives, my first question is always going to be which has the best liquidity? Then my second question is which one costs less?\n\nMissing from your stats of the two alternatives is the bid/ask spread and the volume on that contract. Those are the best indicators for liquidity. Narrow bid/ask is better liquidity. Higher volume is better liquidity. \n\nAssuming liquidity is good on both alternatives, which one costs less? All else being equal, it almost always works out best if you start with the lowest cost alternative. Most of the time, the lower cost alternative also has the lower reward, those things go hand-in-hand. But that may be an acceptable trade-off if the reward you give up translates into a reduction in costs, like it makes your holding time lower and thus a lower opportunity cost, or an increase in win rate. I'd rather win a little money most of the time than a lot of money a few times.\n\nBecause opportunity cost and theta decay are real costs, I also tend to pick the shortest holding time. That means I tend to go no further out than 60 days to expiration on any one position.\n\nSo in a situation like yours where the payoff date is uncertain but there is a good support level on value, I'd use a cheap 45 to 60 DTE call that is a good balance of risk/reward (could be anything from 55 to 30 delta) and just keep rolling it every 30 days, profit or loss.

Equity LEAPS generally have their expiration in January, so if it isn't January, it's probably not a LEAPS.\n\nOptions that expire in 6 to 9 months are most likely going to be quarterly expirations, though you may hit a monthly by coincidence. Generally, monthly expirations include the current month and the next 3 months, so anything from 0 to 3 months out is easy to get on most option chains. Between 3 and 12 months you'll only find quarterlies. For example, ignoring weeklies, the NFLX expirations are Apr, May, Jun, Jul and then a gap until the quarterly in Sep and then another gap until the LEAPS in January.\n\nGoing that far out increases up front costs, which increases your risk.\n\nSo the adjustment I would make is to use monthly expirations and stay within 3 months.

I sell a covered call at $105 strike and get a $3  premium. That means on the other side their break even price is $108.\n\nQuestion  1: Lets say the price reaches $110 before the expiration date. If the  buyer decides to exercise his right to buy the shares, does this mean  the contract is \"completed\" and it will go away and I will have given up  the 100 shares before the expiration date? Or is it that when the buyer  exercises his right he still has to wait til the expiration date to  claim the 100 shares?\n\n\\- I'm  guessing the answer to the question above is that he will have to wait  til expiration to exercise because by the expiration date it could be  OTM and the seller would keep the shares.\n\nQuestion  2: Lets say the price reaches $106. He hasn't broke even yet, and since  its almost the expiration date, it would make more sense for him to  sell a call (?) against the one he bought from me.  In order to do this  he would have to sell at the same $105 strike, but because of time decay  and some weird stuff about greeks, the premium he can get from selling a  call is $1 premium. He would lose $2 (or $200 total) -- but this would  be better than exercising and losing $200 plus extrinsic value (?). In  this scenario, because he just wanted to exit out of his call option,  would I still keep my 100 shares? (because he did not exercise, rather  just sold a call to exit his position).\n\nQuestion  3: Kinda a follow up to the above: It almost seems like unless the  buyer of the call option reaches the break even, that chances of shares  being exercised (called away) are very slim? Like if the price reached  106 or 107 it doesn't make sense to exercise until after 108.\n\nQuestion  4: Let's say im bullish on the stock. The price reaches $104 at 0 DTE. I  don't want it to reach 105 by the end of the day and get assigned. So  can I cancel out my position by buying a 105 call, wait for the day to  end, and rather than net $300, I can just net $200 profit on premiums,  but this also protects me from having my shares called away because i  cancelled out my position (just need to wait til end of the day for this  to actually happen at 0 DTE?). Then the next day I can start selling a  $110 strike for a new expiration date?\n\nQuestion 5: Why are you so awesome for answering my questions?\n\nI  guess my questions are all based on what I would have learned if I  actually traded covered calls, but I'm just trying to learn the theory  right now. Thanks!", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "What you need to understand is that there is, for all practical purposes, no buyer on the other end of your trades.\n\nThe way to think of it is like this: when you buy a call option, what you are really doing is making a deal with the OCC (the Options Clearing Corporation.)  You are paying them money (the premium,) and in exchange, they put your name on a list of people who have the right to buy 100 shares of the underlying at the strike price by the expiration date.\n\nSimilarly, when you sell a call, you are really in effect receiving a payment in exchange for agreeing to have the OCC put you on the list of people who are willing to sell 100 shares of the underlying at the strike price by the expiration date.\n\nThen, when a long holder (a person on the long list) chooses to exercise, they pick a name from the short list at random and assign them.\n\nOf course, this is a gross oversimplification; there are market makers, exchanges, and brokerages, but thinking of it this way will help you to understand why certain things may or may not happen.  As a short seller you are not somehow linked to any particular long buyer.  You could get assigned at any time for any reason, and you have no idea what the particular position of the person out there in the world who is exercising is.  You need to count on getting assigned on any short options that are even 1 cent ITM at expiration.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "> Question  1\n\nIf the buyer exercised, you will be assigned on the same day and your shares called away before 11:59pm on that day. Expiration is the deadline by which the buyer has to make that decision. They don't have to wait for expiration to get their shares if they exercised 2 weeks before.\n\nNow, all that said, nearly all buyers *wait until expiration to exercise* because exercising early throws away any gains on the time value of the contract. There's essentially an early exercise cash penalty, and that penalty is 100% of the premium for OTM options. Example, when XYZ was $100 buyer bought a $120 call for $1. Two weeks before expiration XYZ is now at $119.95 and the call is worth $2. They exercise and pay $120/share to get the shares, but they lose all of the $2 value of the call also. So net net, they end up paying $122/share for shares that are only worth $119.95, a $2.05 loss per share.\n\n\n\n> Question 2: Lets say the price reaches $106. He hasn't broke even yet\n\nHow would you know if he broke-even or not? You have no idea how much that buyer paid for the contract. You trade with a market maker and then the market maker trades with someone else. If the market maker bought your contract for $3, you can bet the MM sold it to someone else for more than $3. And then that someone else might sell it back to the MM for less and then they sell it for a lot more, and around and around. The contract could have traded hands 20 times before it gets exercised, for prices ranging from $.01 to $6, and you have no idea which price ultimately was paid before exercise.\n\nThere is no point in trying to guess what the other end of the trade is going to do. It doesn't matter.\n\n> Question 3\n\nThe chances of *early* exercise are slim before expiration, because of the penalty for early exercise described above. If it is the day before or the day of expiration, chances are much higher, and if the contract is ITM after expiration, the chances are very close to 100% that the contract will be exercised.\n\n> Question 4\n\nNo, you can't \"cancel out\" your **winning CC** that way. Why would you want to? Your trade is winning! If the stock goes over 105, you should celebrate, you got the profit you selected yourself when you opened the CC and you keep all of the premium. If you want more profit than that, don't trade covered calls, just hold shares.\n\n> Question 5\n\nWhy are you so awesome for asking such great questions? It's clear you are thinking about all this.

A reasonable average annual return rate to shoot for with respect to covered call income alone (ignoring gains on the shares themselves) is around 5%. As a monthly return, that's around 0.41%. In order to generate $2K/month, you would need about $422k of capital. If you have $120k of capital, you can reasonably shoot for $570/month of income. Notice that even if you double the annual rate to 10%, which some experienced traders may be able to do, that's a monthly rate of about 0.80%, so around $1100/month on $120k. And *that's an average*.

Primary dealers borrow overnight loans from the PDCF through their clearing banks at the primary credit rate offered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\nA frequency-based fee is assigned to primary dealers who borrow from the PDCF on more than 45 business days.\n\nFinancial Crisis\nThe facility was one of a number of steps taken by the government to free up credit during the financial crisis. The 2008 financial crisis was the worst economic disaster since the Great Depression of 1929. The crisis was the result of a sequence of events, each with its own trigger and culminating in the near collapse of the banking system. It has been argued that the seeds of the crisis were sown as far back as the 1970s with the Community Development Act, which forced banks to loosen their credit requirements for lower-income minorities creating a market for subprime mortgages.\n\nThe Federal Reserve made loans totaling $8.95 trillion to primary dealers in exchange for a wide range of collateral under its Primary Dealer Credit Facility.  Citigroup, Merrill Lynch, and Morgan Stanley each received loans that total more than $1 trillion. However, these were overnight loans, which were frequently rolled over into new loans.

Bonds are being sold off like crazy and real yields are negative. \n\nGE?  Out.  Going through a restructuring right now which seems to look promising, but they're doing wonky things like a reverse stock split that I don't like.\n\nGME? Out.  Yeah it might go to the moon, and Ryan Cohen might save it, but then again I might also be dead by the time any of that happens. \n\n(I was holding all 4 of these at one point)\n\nOther hypothetical examples:\nARKK? Pass. If I had bought in 12 months ago, great play.   But right now?  It's not something I'm sure I want to be holding, and definitely don't want to be buying at this price.  Cathy Wood did great, but her God talk is wonky to me and anyone who was heavy in tech had a great year, not just her.  I don't know if I trust her abilities going forward. \n\nARKX? Pass, for same reasons plus I don't understand why she picked the stocks she did at all.  Wonky.  God talk, etc. \n\nTSLA? Pass.  Way too expensive right now even if future earnings might (keyword *might*)  justify this P/E ratio. Too volatile, too. \n\nXXII? Pass.  You probably haven't heard of this one, but someone recommended them to me because they might be the future of smoking with their \"zero nicotine cigarettes\".  That's just wonky, folks, even if there might be a small market for that, ugh, maybe. \n\nBitcoin?  Out.  Not a real currency and way too volatile and uncertain. \n\nI probably triggered some people. Feel free to explain why I'm wrong about any of these.\n\nAnd of course, no risk, no reward.  So if you want to put a little bit into Bitcoin or Tesla, by all means.  But my current philosophy is that we can just avoid all the wonkiness and go for the straight forward plays.  You know, the Apples, Microsofts, Costcos, Phillip Morris, etc.  Or hell, go ahead and stick it in VOO. I didn't, that's not my style, but it's a safer play than probably everything I listed at the beginning.\n\nI'm new to this so take what I'm saying with a grain of salt.  But I think I understand why they say that \"most people lose money in the stock market\".  It's because they're always chasing performance (buying ARKK at ATH) and picking winners based off some vague notion like \"Elon Musk and Tesla are the future\".  It's not smart, and it's a recipe for disaster. \n\nIf you are like Mr. Keith Gill and can truly identify deep value, more power to you.  But you don't find deep value by buying the same stocks that everyone else is. \n\nTL; DR: the markets are pretty weird and uncertain right now.  So, IMO, why make things any more uncertain or wonky?  Just stick with good businesses that will do well in the sort, mid, and long term.\n\nOr do index funds. I chose individual stocks because with my picks I think I will be safer in the event of a correction.  The market can be kinda wonky sometimes, too.

Even with Lithium I'm hesitant to say it's the way forward as we've come to find the impact of lithium mining is extremely detrimental to aquifers and the environment overall. \n\nBack Pedal a little bit to Strategic metals, Copper, Nickel, Zinc. These metals have a multitude of applications and will have many more come future breakthroughs. So I ask, why haven't we seen Mining players see similar growth albeit some have seen tremendous gains but overall it's not reflected as proportional to Lithium.\n\nI've been fortunate enough to get myself a Mining Engineering degree so I know a thing or two about the industry and can pick out the nuggets of gold when I read through the right Technical report which to the untrained eye looks like utter nonsense. This has led me to making some pretty wise investments thus far.\n\nWhat I'm getting at is, I'm with you on the safe bets but why haven't the masses realized that in order to further these technologies and initiatives we need to dig up some rock and we have well known miners digging up some good rock and others with huge potential.\n\nMy high flying mining players I've got in my portfolio at the moment are:\n Rio Tinto (Huge miner, equally huge dividend)\n Barrick (Gold Player who recently erased some big debt and are frothing at the mouth with future potential given the trajectory of inflation)\nTalon Metals (High Grade Green Nickel project in the US)(Future Mine in the US and will come online as the only remaining US Nickel mine shuts down (~2023)\nBHP (Huge Player even bigger Staying power also a solid dividend) \n\n\n\nTLDR: Why gamble exponential losses when you can have safe solid returns and still see solid growth.

It’s being seen by many people and companies as a real asset/hedge against inflation. It has always been volatile and uncertain, but that hasn’t stopped it from going from a penny for multiple bitcoin to 60,000$ for a bitcoin. Most people don’t feel comfortable buying in because it’s too volatile, but the fact is it’s literally the best investment of the past decade, and so far even the best investment of this decade. The way I look at it is a hedge against basically everything. Everyone should put in 1–5% of their stock portfolio in bitcoin, not only would it increase its value if everyone did so, but it would lessen the volatility in the long run. Not only that, but what’s a few % of your portfolio? You should be making a decent return, probably a very minimum of 5%(just to beat inflation) in your portfolio, so if you put 5% of bitcoin in your portfolio you’re losing out on one year of gains by putting 5% into bitcoin, and that’s saying that it goes to 0$, which will never happen. \n\nI’m assuming you live in the USA, but it holds true no matter where you live, but if the USA has an collapse of its massive debt, things could get really bad here, our dollar could become worthless. For me, 5% of my money in bitcoin is a hedge against that securing my future, knowing I will be able to be independent from the government if it does happen. I’d put the probability at maybe 5% or more of a total/major collapse in my lifetime, and that’s just piece of mind. I’d put the probability that bitcoin becomes a stable/seen as a legitimate currency in the next 10-20 years at 90%. 5% that it completely fails. For me, those are good odds.
