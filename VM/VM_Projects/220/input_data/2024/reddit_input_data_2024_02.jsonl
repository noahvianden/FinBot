I read the white paper and went online because I was thirsty for more info. It was quickly apparent that most people online had no idea what they were talking about. I remember one of the most popular crypto YT'ers at the time had a video claiming that he knew BTC was going to go up 30% next month. I had been investing a lot in Tech and was excited to hear his DD. He ended up revealing that he knew it would go up that much because it had gone up 30% the month before. I was dying laughing but people were eating it up in the comments like he was some genius. The guy ended up being correct that it was a great investment but the logic he used to get there was deeply flawed.\n\nThat's still how I feel about most of the community. Most people are unwilling to be skeptical or critical of the space and its future because they want to be rich so badly - and it's easier to believe whatever theory comes along and points the way they want.

In a blockchain, all activity is economic activity as the blockspace is the scarce resource, and the native cryptocureemcy on that network is used to pay for space in the next block to settle transactions, that cost rises with demand. The transaction fee, or gas, has a separate rate than the crypto asset, and can be used to predict how much crypto will move on that network. (Some cryptoeconomies let you trade gas directly, or someone and their competitors developed a way to) When gas is too high because all the blocks are full, smaller transactions stop occurring resulting - because they arent worth it - in a further constriction in supply. Even brokers cant source the crypto fast enough to settle trades on their centralized order books.

{"title": "Purely in theory, why would anyone ever buy a stock that doesn't pay dividends (in a perfect market)?", "selftext": "*Disclaimer: I am quite new to investing/trading and just recently learned about how to value a company and P/E and DCF and so on, so this question may be very stupid.*\n\nSo the reason one buys a stock, ignoring voting rights and other such immaterial gains, is because one expects a return on the investment that in a couple years will be higher than the initial investment.\n\nFor a dividend stock this is very easy: say the stock has a P/E of 10, so you pay 10$ today for 1$ of todays earnings. So to keep it simple, we assume the company's cashflow is the same as the earnings and the dividends are the same as the cashflow and that there is no growth, your investment will have paid off in 10 years just through dividends.\n\nNow add to that the fact that you usually choose a company that grows in earnings and the fact that you can sell this stock to someone else at a higher price and suddenly your investment will pay off much sooner.\n\nBut now take a stock where the company has publicly stated that they will never pay a dividend, such as ACM Research when I was going through one of their SEC filings. In this case no matter if you hold the stock for 1 day or 100 years, no matter if the company's earnings double every year, you will never see a cent of it. In fact, your investment will have lost money through inflation and cost of opportunity.\n\nSo why then do people buy these stocks? To sell them to someone else later. Okay. But why do those other ones buy the stock then? To sell them to someone else later. Okay, but... - you get the point? To me it seems like the greater fool theory at work. You always count on there being another fool to buy the stock off of you.\n\nBut if this were a perfect market (it's not) where everyone collectively agrees that non-dividend stocks have no value because they won't ever give you a single cent in returns, then nobody would ever buy such a stock off of you, and the stock's price would collapse. It doesn't matter then how much the company may grow in valuation because nobody will ever see a cent from it.\n\nNow this doesn't apply if you count on the company paying dividends in the future after the growth phase, or it doing a share buyback or such things. But that is why I took the example of a company that has stated that it will never do such a thing, such as ACM Research.\n\nSo then, why would anyone ever buy such a stock in a perfect market? What am I missing here?\n\n**EDIT: Alot of people don't seem to get that my question is purely theoretical in nature assuming a perfect market. I get that in real-life thongs work differently. That is why I have several non-dividend paying stocks on my watchlist, including the aforementioned one.**\n\n**But I have also been told that shareholders if they have enough voting power can overrule a company's management and successfully demand the payment of dividends. So in that case then that answers the question even in a perfect market.**\n\n**EDIT2:**\n\n**Another excellent point on why people would buy such a stock even in a perfect market:**\n\n> You need to understand that if you own 100% of stocks then you own the full company. If the company is profitable, there will be people interested in owning it, willing to pay a good price for the stock, pushing the price higher. The more profitable the company is, the more people will be interested in owning the company or at least some part of it. If you buy a stock then at some point someone will want to buy it from you because they will want to get their voting rights from 40% to 60%, something like that\n\n**I think my question has been sufficiently answered then. Thank you.**\n\n**EDIT3:**\n\n**Another reason:**\n\n> The one caveat to this would be the potential for a buy-out. Some small companies don't pay dividends, but are likely to be bought out at some point by a larger company for a price that will be returned to shareholders in cash or new equity.\n\nEDIT4: (last one lol)\n\nHonestly I had a \"conversation\" with ChatGPT about it yesterday and it didnt even give me one of those answers, only one of the many other answers I already got here that didnt really adress the issue...\n", "id": "1anmhm4", "created_utc": 1707588786.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.47, "num_comments": 214, "comments": [{"body": "That is actually the view that Mr. Wonderful has, if it doesn‚Äôt pay a dividend it is valueless.

Iirc each atlas robot (Boston dynamics humanoid robot) costs like $10 million in hardware...? Optimus is intended to be $20k (I say intended to be because factories always start expensive until they get up to full production cadence).\n\nFailure after failure...? Bro, I watched this company go from a measly like 10k electric vehicles per year to 1.8 million per year (over 5.5 million cars out total). The best selling car in the world is an electric vehicle thanks to Tesla (the model Y). As an environmentalist, I'm absolutely thrilled. They even achieved the affordable electric vehicle they promised in 2016 (in 2016 dollars the base model 3 which costs $35k from inventory is actually $28k due to inflation, and also in 2016 the tax credit didn't exist so more like $22k now if you include that).\n\nThey've also finally released the cybertruck and it's awesome, Tesla energy has now replaced all coal energy in Hawaii (that one's a powerplant but I believe they also have half a million power walls installed now which is not insignificant), and the supercharger network is so large now that it is effectively ~90% as good as gas stations for EVs imo (which is why all the car manufacturers in the US switched to Tesla's NACS plug recently. *All* of them).\n\nI realize that some things Tesla has promised has taken longer than expected to pull off, but the affordable EV and insane profitability of Tesla are the main things I remember people saying were \"impossible\" back in the day. So today when I see people saying that FSD, the $25k EV, and Optimus are \"impossible\" that makes me even more excited for the future. As an investor I could not be happier with the job elon musk has been doing with the company.

The KES in has a capacity of 565 MWh, 185 MWh (about 33%) of which are the Tesla packs, and it is not replacing all coal, it is replacing the black out back up power plants which were coal. Currently 28% of the state's energy is renewable (good and growing), of which 1.1GWh was solar. So right now, Tesla can theoretically support about 5% of Hawaii's power demand.\n\nSupercharger accessibility varies depending on your location.

Trending stocks will be volatile and these are the ones ideal for trading.

I completely understand your sentiment here, but there seems (to me at least) to be a lot more that drives trading/wallstreet than just fundamentals. Technicals may not be as 'reliable' to the main amount of posters here, but they can still make a big difference with the right setups.\n\nThat said, Nokia does have a gigantic float, but their fundamentals and financials are quite solid. The issue with the float was proven to be for the most part a non-issue in January 2021. Granted it would obviously take some volume to move it, but if you look at the amount of shares that move the stock, it actually doesn't really take much at all. The biggest problem for an actual sustained increase in share price is people constantly taking profit at every resistance.\n\nNokia has gone sideways for quite some time, we all know that. BUT. As an unquoted poster on here once said a few months back, Nokia is one unlikely catalyst away from mooning. It may take forever, it may not, but January 2021 proved that this thing can *move* if volume shows up. Consider how long it has gone sideways. Also consider how many traders out there will only engage in a trade if there is a clear indication of strength/breakout. Especially consider what can happen to a beaten down stock if it truly catches momentum. Rubber-band effect. The harder you pull it back sort of thing. EVERYONE KNOWS all this stock does is go sideways. What happens if that dramatically changes upwards?\n\nAll you have to do is draw one (resistance) line on Nokia's chart on the NYSE and you'll see why January 2021 even happened in the first place and the opportunity it is now presenting and staring everyone who actually looks in the face. A *major* resistance trendline was broken. The most recent drop Nokia had down to $2.94 tested that line for buying support which, so far, has held. \n\nIf you draw just one more (support) line starting from the 2012 low and connect the covid low, Nokia tested that in after hours trading as well. That support line holding was a *very* major technical development. If you're not aware of charting patterns, Nokia is in a GIGANTIC decade long consolidation (pennant) pattern. \n\nEverything I have learned about trading so far has led me to this very stock as arguably one of the biggest opportunities a person may ever get in trading. Nokia has the chart setup of a literal generational buying opportunity at the moment. It just needs volume.\n\nTrading is about making money, right? Wallstreet wants to make money. WE want to make money. To do so, we need to find opportunities. 2 Very simple lines on Nokia's chart tell me that this is the most slept-on opportunity in the entire market. I may be a noob but I know for a fact I'm not the only one seeing it. In fact, my personal theory is that Nokia is bashed and SUPPRESSED as hard as it is because of that. In regards to justification of a much higher share price...Bro this is trading. There are tons of stocks out there that had/are having insane runs that are nowhere near justified. TSLA was the OG in that respect.\n\nWHEN volume shows up on the buy side, Nokia is going to shock the world. This is a perfect setup if I ever saw one. Disclaimer: I am a poor and literally all-in on $7c 1/16/26 bought on 12/5/23.\n\nThis thing is LITERALLY going to the fucking MOON.\nMark my words.\n\nEdit: Act of God here we come.", "score": 23, "replies": [{"body": "What we're seeing here is bagholder denial, you're still poor after NOK's last run and rugpull in 2020 for a reason", "score": 18, "replies": [{"body": "https://preview.redd.it/3qf0gvictwkc1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bd7afed7e65d80288a96dfb6c90a09b5781ba2ff", "score": 9, "replies": []}, {"body": "What a time that was to be alive", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I miss the Iron Condor memes, best part of 2020 along with the PLTR memes", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Fuck this shit im in", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "tld", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "Basically 100% of stocks I tracked on wsb  recs have been a loss over an extended time range.
