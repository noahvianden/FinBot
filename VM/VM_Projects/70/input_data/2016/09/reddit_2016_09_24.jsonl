{"title": "Apple shares fall 2% after report of 25% drop forecast in iPhone sales in 2017 - GfK", "selftext": "- Sales in Asia and Europe have been very weak. ~25% decline compared to the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus (which were already quite weak). \n\n- This is in line with forecasts by Taiwanese/Korean companies, all of which see a ~20% decline in chip and memory orders. \n\n- Expensive $160 Airpods is one of the likely reasons why sales are so poor. Customers feel cheated as it shows how much Apple prefers money over customer choice. \n\n- Apple has failed to capitalize on Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 delay due to the lithium battery explosion problem.\n\n- This sales decline trend will continue until Apple finds a new growth engine (will it be VR or cars or something else?).\n\nThe news:\n\n\"Shares of Apple slid on Friday amid speculation that German research firm GfK issued a report suggesting iPhone 7 sales would be lower than last year, based on data in Europe and Asia.\n\nApple shares dropped as much as 2.7 per cent as reports spread. The stock ended down 1.7 per cent at $US112.71 in New York.\n\nBusiness Insider said people who have seen a copy of the report say it claims that iPhone 7 unit sales are down 25 per cent on an annual basis, compared with the iPhone 6S of last year. GfK's report doesn't measure sales in the US.\n\n\"Numbers on sales or market shares are confidentially provided to our clients and shall not be quoted or released to the public,\" GfK said in an emailed statement. \"We did not publish these figures for external release.\"\n\nAn Apple spokeswoman didn't immediately comment on the report.\n\nA Taiwan-based electronics newsletter Digitimes reported earlier Friday that Apple told its chip partners that iPhone 7 chip orders would fall about 20 per cent in the first quarter of 2017 from the previous quarter.\"\n\nhttp://www.afr.com/technology/mobiles-and-tablets/apple/apple-shares-slide-after-gfk-sees-lower-iphone-7-sales-outside-of-the-us-20160923-grnism\n\n\"Shares of Apple (AAPL) suddenly moved sharply lower in afternoon trading around 1:30 pm, Eastern time, apparently because of remarks being attributed to market research firm GfK indicating some decline in the performance of sales of the iPhone 7 in Europe.\n\nAccording to TheFlyontheWall, GfK’s “channel checks” show “that the iPhone 7 launch in Europe is down 25% versus the iPhone 6 launch. Apple shares are down 2%, or $1.86, to $112.76 in afternoon trading.”\"\n\nhttp://blogs.barrons.com/techtraderdaily/2016/09/23/apple-dips-as-gfk-claims-europe-iphone-sales-down-25-from-iphone-6/", "id": "549c5i", "created_utc": 1474705848.0, "score": 97, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 67, "comments": [{"body": "You think that even with the Samsung battery incident Apple would be poised to take advantage of the situation.
