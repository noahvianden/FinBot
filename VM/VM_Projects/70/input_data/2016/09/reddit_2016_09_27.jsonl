I met some cool people, a lot of cunts etc. Blew out more accounts than I can count. Was really bitter about most of it for a long time. Lost over 250k \"learning\". Had ups and downs with lots of the Canadian guys. Some of which i have a lot of respect for, despite all the immature bullshit that went on back then. \n\nIm 32 now. Traveled  the world a bit and learned to trade. Took a lot of focus, but it's been much more smooth. Made a lot of enemies back in the day. If you're still here, we can look back and have a laugh about it. Keep the tradition alive, honor my many blow outs. Hope all is well. I'll be on here for a bit, killing some time.\n\n-cjp ", "id": "54rquy", "created_utc": 1474997703.0, "score": 104, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 66, "comments": [{"body": "250k loss to learn?
