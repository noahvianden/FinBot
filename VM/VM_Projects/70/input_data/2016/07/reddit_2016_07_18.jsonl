(Which I'm pretty sure this is how most beginners are starting off.)\n\nI did my research on all companies that I was interested in before I made my initial trade and tried not to listen to anyone who would tell me to buy this and that especially when I had no idea of what those companies were.\n\nI never timed the market and didn't really panic when the companies that I invested on had dips here and there. I held onto them knowing that they will eventually go up (with a research) and this method has been working pretty well for me so far.\n\n\nFor those of you who might wonder what I invested in, most of my earnings are from ATVI, NVDA and AMD. (I'm currently working in the IT field and tech stocks are what I'm most familiar of.) I've invested in DIS, MSFT and few others here and there but I only made little off of them.\n\n\nInvesting in a Roth IRA and a stock market was the best decision that I've made last year and I'm grateful to have these extra earnings following along.\n\n\nI'm not an expert in anyway but if anyone who are trying to start their first trading is in need of help, I'll be more than happy to help! :)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEdit1. I usually setup a line and once that line has been hit, I put a stop loss with a certain % above the initial price. So let's say your stock was up 10% from $5.00 to $5.50. Then I would decide a certain % (let's say 5% in this case) and setup a stop loss at $5.25. In this case I would still be making some profit even if the stock falls. :)\n\nEdit2. I don't time the market :) I usually buy and hold. I didn't start (and didn't expected) stock trading to double or triple my money within few months. I started it simply thinking that investing on a stock market would be a better option than my savings account ;)", "id": "4tgqvg", "created_utc": 1468867822.0, "score": 80, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 74, "comments": [{"body": "27% in one year!
