{"title": "Fuck you World Chaos", "selftext": "You've turned this subreddit into a cesspool of idiocy. Every post I look at is either a post from the plebs or a post saying, \"Fuck the plebs!\"\n\nIt's fucking astonishing how people can be so impressed at what you did. Congratulations, you made 55k. You were YOLOing, that's right, but do you not fucking realize how lucky you were? Maybe you do, but apparently the /r/all autists don't. All you did was repeatedly by puts, and it just so happened timing was on your side this time. Did you call a Chinese market crash? Did you call an oil plummet? No, all you did was repeatedly place put bets on the market, even when IV was soaring. Yeah, I've seen your explanations. \"Durr hurr, I saw the support levels were broken.\" Bullshit! Indicators like that in the situation the market was in can mean it will move either way you delusional piece of shit! A single short squeeze and you would've been permanently fucked.\n\nThe only reason you don't see other posts like this is because the people who actually know what they're doing trading options aren't sticking their dicks through the glory hole and praying it doesn't get cut off. Everyone else has either the common sense not to gamble like a complete degenerate or they're failing because of fucking probability.\n\nNow this subreddit is saturated with a bunch of retards who think what you did took skill and that they can become fucking millionaires by getting rich quick.\n\nIf you think I'm exaggerating just go look at this link: reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets\n\nI foresee the death of this subreddit. If you want some predictions of how it will miserably end take a look at /r/stocks.
