A majority of people in this country actually *don't* want to leave. That's the first point.    \n\nThe second: The referendum was conducted regarding leaving the EU.

Do you favour removing ourselves from all trade deals, all free movement, all customs unions, defence initiatives, regulatory agreements (would we leave the EMA, for example? I doubt it because our pharma industry would be fucked, but nobody seems to understand this and the lunatics have taken over the asylum). If only 5% of those who voted to leave *don't* want a hard Brexit (I would gamble everything I own on at least 5%), then we shouldn't go for a hard Brexit. So, we will de facto be in the EU, because if you have a 'soft' Brexit, then you keep basically everything, but lose democratic representation. So much for democracy.    \n\nThis is a whole lot more complicated than Brexit means Brexit. And *that's* why Article 50 has not been triggered, and the Lib Dems are right to fight for *at least* another referendum, on the basis of *what kind of Brexit we are voting for*, because we haven't actually voted for that.

The government expected the referendum to be a complete whitewash and for everyone to vote remain. They did not. I believe you are making the same mistake in suggesting that the 30% of non-turnout will be people whose opinion is \"fuck it, let's just remain\" - they will not. Some of them will be, others will be thinking that leave is best, but for the most part these people have already lost faith in democracy. I also feel that another referendum today would be the same result but with a higher turnout and in fact a higher majority for leave - we were told that voting leave would cause instant, huge irreparable damage, so far we've been tickled and people can see the fear mongering for what it was.\n\nRegarding soft vs hard Brexit, it's a matter of taste. We need to remove ourselves from ties with Europe and generate new ones globally. Personally, I believe that we should offer equality in our systems - the same trade deals should exist over Europe as exist in the rest of the world. While this is probably impossible, it's much more easy for us to attempt to achieve this outside of Europe where we can create our own deals.\n\nThat last point applies to migration also - which I find highly amusing. Throughout the referendum I've been told that I'm a racist, and I've been told that some very influential people have called me racist. If I were to describe Europe as honestly as I can, it would suddenly appear exactly the opposite. It's effectively a group of fairly well developed countries, predominantly white, who give each other pretty open access to trade and freedom of movement. At the same time that collective limits the accessibility of trade and freedom of movement to people from other parts of the world. It's probably the most racist organisation that exists... You're all white, well off countries, come join us. Oh, Turkey, go away please, you're embarrassing yourself.\n\nSo, when I talk about Brexit, I'm hoping for a system where both Europeans and the rest of the world can compete on an equal playing field for access to our country. I expect us to be able to recruit the best of the best from all over the world, and to give those from each country an equal opportunity to be part of our own.

Once we make the decision, sign the paperwork, get the proceedings underway uncertainty will disappear and people will begin to re-invest (so long as the powers that be don't make bad decisions). Naturally there will be a spike where our economy and currency hits an \"all time low\", and the media will try to scare living shit out of everyone with that, but that spike will be recoverable and it's primarily short term. We're clearly stable enough to survive that now.\n\nTo me, free movement is a liberty that is abused. I've had this moral question recently with a friend of mine. He lives in India and he works for the same company as me. He came to our office for about 2 months to work here and get experience in agile software development processes. While he was here, we really liked him, and we've made him an offer of employment. We want him to come here and work, and I think he wants to. The problem this raises is pretty potent... If we are to leech all the good people from the crappy places in the world, how are those places ever going to improve? And on comes the problem of Europe. It is my opinion that a lot of the people coming from the depressed areas of Eastern Europe are actually the intelligent ones. Why wouldn't you come to the UK? We have very good healthcare, education, employment opportunities, while in eastern Europe these things are all to a much lower standard - What you end up with is all the \"best of Europe\" in the west, and the east is left with whatever is available.

We have more jobs than people. Pre-Brexit, London was producing enough jobs for an extra 300k people per year. In pharma, we can't fill the positions we're offering (and yes, we recruit globally).   \n\nIt's natural that 50% of our immigration comes from the closest (geographically, culturally) 27 countries. 85% of Swiss immigration comes from Europe, too, despite not being in the EU (although sensibly they retain free movement and free trade).

It stands to reason that if you only take people in from nearby countries or \"culturally similar\" countries, you have problems.\n\nI have traveled Europe and I hear what you're saying, but look at whose made the sensible life decisions. While the people who are leaving are the cleaners, builders, plumbers... They are leaving and now obtaining a better quality of life as a result. Those left behind may well be the lawyers, bankers, whatever, but it says something about their real success that they are not here already. A small number of the people coming here will, naturally, be of the elk \"I don't want to work to improve my life, so I'll just move somewhere where I don't have to\", but I know a lot of Polish people living here, and they are mostly hard workers who do their bit and contribute to the country. It strikes me that remaining in \n\nThe only reason our migration diversity levels are as low as they are is because we do have a physical border which is rather difficult to cross. I have no doubt that if we shared a substantial land border, as Switzerland does, we would be at exactly the same dangerous levels of migration diversity that Switzerland has right now.\n\nIn short: we've made the mistake of having a very lightweight immigration policy in the past and the result is horrific.
