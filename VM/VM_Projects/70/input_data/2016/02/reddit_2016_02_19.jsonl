{"title": "I put together some recourses for noobs like myself", "selftext": "edit: resources* because I'm an idiot.\n\n\nThe last few months I’ve been reading a lot about options and investing. I try to save as many links as I can when learning about something, so I thought I would put together a list of sources that have helped me \"understand\" all this craziness. I’m still very much a noob! Just thought this could help those that are also learning. This community is a lot of fun to follow, and I've learnt a lot from all of you.\n\n\n\n**Books:**\n\n* Understanding Options- Michael Sincere\n[Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Options-2E-Michael-Sincere/dp/0071817840/ref=pd_sim_14_2?ie=UTF8&dpID=51%2B756SczwL&dpSrc=sims&preST=_AC_UL160_SR105%2C160_&refRID=0MXXNR0SR7GAZMNM5FPM)\n\n\n* Options as a Strategic Investment - Lawrence G. McMillan\nI see this recommended a lot. It is over a thousand pages and packed with info.\n[Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Options-Strategic-Investment-Lawrence-McMillan/dp/0735204659)\n\n\n\n* Profiting with Iron Condor Options  - Hanania Benklifa (Haven’t finished this one yet)\n[Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Profiting-Iron-Condor-Options-Strategies/dp/0134394607/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1455900402&sr=1-1&keywords=iron+condor)\nThis doesn’t go over the basics of options\n\n\n\n* What Works on Wall Street - O’Shaughnessy\n[Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/What-Works-Street-Fourth-Edition/dp/0071625763)\n\nThis isn’t about options, but I was thinking the trending value stock screen can be used for options? Stocks can be screened using matlab to get O’Shaughnessy top 25.\n\n\n\n**Links:**\n\n* Options Greeks\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUU53bPUB2s\n\n* Relative Strength index\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZWO1JisCwc\n\n* TTM Squeeze \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbmUfauTGkU\n\n\n-More on:\nBollinger Bands\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq3gkwin1y4\nKeltner Channels\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5iIUglLu8o\t\n\n* Fibonacci Levels\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwJ-i5xJz8s\n\nhttp://www.learningmarkets.com/using-fibonacci-analysis-to-create-trading-strategies/\n\n\n* MACD Crossover:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWEQgT8iDfg\n\nI'm a dude on the internet, use proper DD.\n\nI found a lot of this just searching around here, so big thanks to all you!\n", "id": "46lw2m", "created_utc": 1455904985.0, "score": 268, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 61, "comments": [{"body": "I don't understand...
