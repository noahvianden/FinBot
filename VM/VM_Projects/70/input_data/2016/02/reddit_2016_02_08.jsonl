OR, you will be wise to buy when tesla will be comparable to say, ford, or apple. a loooooooooooong time from now.\n\non the other hand, you have great talk and bold ideas. how much of a premimum you want to put on this, how much you want to invest your money on something that *if* everything goes reasonably well, and according to the company vision, will increase its price 10 fold, well... that's up to you, how much risk you want to take, and how much money you want to throw away for the next 10-15 years, minimum (that's *if* Elon is right and things go well. otherwise, you've just thrown your money away on this guy's dreams).\n\nif you want to buy and \"trade\" (meaning that you are going to sell at any time before 10 years) then do yourself a favour and study much more technical analysis, because if you want to do that kind of deal, you shouldn't be asking these questions: even if you buy well today, because \"someone on reddit\" told you to do so, you *will* most likely loose all of the money tomorrow when you will panic and sell at a wrong time.\n\nEDIT: i have a grand total of FOUR tsla stocks. that's enough. if the company wins big time, i will have had my fun, and i will be able to tell to my friends \"i knew, i was there!\" when i buy them a drink with the pocket money i will have done. if the company goes belly up... i've wasted just a thousand euros: i can afford that.\n\nEDIT 2: let's pretend that tsla is $150, for ease of calculation. +100% in 5 years will bring it to $300, which is just 4.8% higher than the highest price tsla has ever reached. my guess: you'd be better off buying a \"boring\" share like disney (if $90 today: at $180 it would be + 47% from its max) or procter & gamble (if $80 today: at $160 it would be +73% from its max). if you're about to tell me that it's extremely unlikely that these stocks will do a +100% in 5 years (that's a 20% growth per year......), please explain me what fundamental reason you have to think that tesla will do better. real numbers, not \"they plan to...\" or \"i've heard that...\". in other words, please explain me why tesla is in fact more than dreams and bold talk.
