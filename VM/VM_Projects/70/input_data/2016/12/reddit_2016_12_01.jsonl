Not too much, increment your short (Averaging Up) every month. \n\nEveryone can agree it's overdue and the banks were starting to become more bullish before the election. Likely they will be back to being bullish once Trump's policies become the norm. \n\nAlso likely is that it will not happen for another year or so, which is why you should wait a bit, short it then (3-6 months), and increment your short averaging it up as you go. A recession will happen eventually, so you might aswell do this, it's pretty much 100% chances of profit.
