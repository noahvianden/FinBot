Â While I was there I got pretty close to the branch manager who had been working in investment companies since the early 2000s. He told me about a time his buddy had a close call with death after buying puts on Tesla. So obviously when you work at a brokerage you shouldn't be trading your personal account at work, but this guy always had his account pulled up and would quickly minimize the screen whenever someone would walk by. I guess he was feeling cocky one day because he sent out a tweet about initiating a short position in Tesla and grabbing some puts, using the hashtag #shortTesla. So that day he goes to Panera Bread for lunch and orders his usual cheddar broccoli soup in a Bread bowl. He eats about 6 spoonfuls before he starts coughing violently and falls over. Paramedics come to the scene and the guy is taken to the hospital on a stretcher. After running some tests they find out that he had a severe allergic reaction to the food. Now this guy had a very grave nut allergy, but obviously there shouldn't be nuts in that soup, especially because the people at that Panera know the guy( he was a regular) and took extra care to not serve him after handling any of the breads or pastries made with nuts. About a week after he gets out of the hospital he finds the receipt from the day he had the attack in his wallet. He glances over the little rectangular paper and what does he see? A small memo added under where the soup was rang up. What did it say, you ask? \"Are you nuts....? -E.M.\" ..... \n\nI shit you not that was one of the craziest things I've heard and I still think about it from time to time, like could it really have been elon?

Its all part of a formula, so if the price is weird, something has to explain it, that thing is IV because time is fixed and price is set by the market. So generally a low IV would be a good buy, high would be a good sell.\n\n\nhowever, I would look at the IV of the \"stock\" which in my understanding isnt really the IV of the underlying, but rather the aggregate of the options.  You will want to look at that and look at where it is as opposed to its average level, or plot IV vs HV. If IV is above average, you would generally want to take selling positions, though I dont usually like unlimited risk, so ill take a spread, either bear call or bull put, then plan your strikes out so you get the most overvalued contract that will expire out of the money.

I bought the right to buy stock at a specific price (strike price = $280) on a specific date (Sept of this year.)\n\nNow, there are 2 big players that are involved in valuing a stock.  Time value and intrinsic value.  Time value always decays as the option approaches its expiration date.  Intrinsic value is the value that the stock currently is above the strike price.\n\nObviously, I'm hoping the stock goes up.  Well up and above $280.  I bought my contracts when the stock was a little below $240.  The stock then increased in value to a little over $260.  Seems like it's climbing and it's well on it's way to over $280 by September right?  Exactly.  So therefore the contract increases in value.  And I sell it to someone else who hopes they can do the same thing as me.\n\nFor every dollar that the underlying stock goes up, the contract also goes up by some amount that is determined on the open market.  When I owned the contract, that amount was $0.30 increase in contract price per $1.00 increase in TSLA.  That amount is called delta. \n\nhttps://www.tradeking.com/education/options/strategies/long-call\n\nThe link explains what a long call is and some of the factors involved.  A long call is fairly simple and is a lot like owning the stock itself, just amplified because you have leverage.  When the stock goes up or down, my option value goes up or down.  Biggest difference that can come back to bite you is time decay.  Each day that passes, assuming the implied volatility of the stock stays the same, the option price is always shrinking closer to its intrinsic value.", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "OK", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "^ Comment of the year right here folks.
