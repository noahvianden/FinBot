Because of stagnating wages and prices which have been going up so we are noting a loss in purchasing power. When you start losing your purchasing power you end up with companies losing revenues and we all know where that leads to. **losing purchasing power**\n&nbsp;\n\nThe BRICS bubble, one can argue if the fall of the emerging economies has been a 'set up' or just the cause of an inevitable bubble collapse. But these countries were the only real Demand companies had left. Losing this is a major blow. **BRICS bubble** \n\n&nbsp;\n\nthe hot topic: OIL. This has also has to do with the loss of BRICS's demand. but also Iran and the US. The US is back on top in terms of oil production and Iran will join the game. Creating more supply and if demand stays low the price will pack a few punches. **oil** . Please check other commodities too, you will see the same effect which is a real bad sign. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nNegative interests are slowly spreading and we have no idea what will happen so this is kinda like 'thin ice' **negative interests**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nNo real growth in the economy while the last 5 years we have seen a surge on the stock market can only indicate one thing: a bubble which is going to explode. I think because global demand is so low and governements being unable to create more purchasing power due huge debts.
