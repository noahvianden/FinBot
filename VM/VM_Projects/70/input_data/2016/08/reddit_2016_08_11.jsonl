NVDA has a scary P/E ratio (~48), but they ahve huge portnetial growth in new areas...AI, virtual reality, driverless car technology.  NVDA makes the best GPU's on the market, which are massively parallel processors, which are going to be utilized by more and more fields.  For instance, I work in nuclear physics.  We use software to simulate radiation interactions in matter.  We are now starting to develop this software to run on GPUs because the sheer quantity of small processors of a GPU will help speed up these simulation tremendously.  This is just one example, and I'm sure there will be many more!\n\nDisclosure: I'm  long on NVDA right.  I got in at $46.60 and doubled down at $55...it's about 40% of my portfolio right now.
