AP has seen the light, and is a penny stock evangelist. Jartek & AP [have an epic options vs pennies battle](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/v0ukn/options_vs_pennies_who_would_put_cyanide_in/) - they both lose a couple of hundred bucks, but we are entertained, and WSB is officially born.

He repeatedly bets five figures [on AAPL calls before earnings.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/2y3c6w/on_monday_when_the_apple_special_event_is_about/) FS claims a supernatural clairvoyance of AAPL. FS then posts about his chest pains and ER visits. He finally suffers an epic loss. Is he dead? Is he alive? Is he is mother? Is he banned? Who cares?\n\n2015: [Photos from the 3rd annual meetup are posted.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/37rkna/recap_third_annual_wsb_meetup_2015/) Where a bunch of dudes hang out on the romantic beaches of Guerrero Mexico. In a completely unrelated event, the wsb banner is changed to thousands of ejaculating dicks. Modpocalypse occurs. Hundreds of random users are added as moderators for a few months. None of the new mods can change the CSS. The constant whining about how [\"wsb isn't what it used to be\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/3odxi6/wsb_pleb_crisis_2015/) continues. Someone attempts to show how selling covered calls is idiot proof, but gets lazy, bets all six figures on Apple, and suffers significant losses. Robinhood gets popular.
