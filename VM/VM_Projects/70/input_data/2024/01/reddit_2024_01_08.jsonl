{"title": "2024 is google time", "selftext": "Disclaimer: This is not financial advice\n\nGoogle (GOOG) is one of the most dominant and innovative companies in the world, with a market cap of over $1.7 trillion and a diverse portfolio of products and services. In this post, I will highlight some of the reasons why I am very bullish on Google and why I think it is a great long-term investment.\n\nAI Drug Discovery\n\nIsomorphic Labs,under Alphabet deepmind, has been working on a new AI drug development project with Eli Lilly and Novartis, which is worth $3 billion.  It is more than open ai last year revenue. It just insane. The AI profitability is not on chatbot but AI industry revolution.\n\nGoogleâ€™s AI drug development project with Eli Lilly and Novartis is a promising venture that could revolutionize the pharmaceutical industry. While the project is still in its early stages, it has the potential to develop new treatments for diseases such as cancer and Alzheimerâ€™s. Investors should keep an eye on this project as it progresses.\n\n\n\n\nWaymo\n\nWaymo is Google's self-driving car subsidiary and one of the most advanced and ambitious projects in the autonomous vehicle industry. Waymo has been operating commercial robotaxi services in Phoenix, Arizona and San Francisco, California, with plans to expand to Los Angeles and Austin, Texas. \n\nWaymo has a competitive edge over its rivals, such as Tesla, Uber, and Lyft, in terms of technology, data, and regulation. Waymo has logged over 20 million miles of real-world driving and over 20 billion miles of simulation, giving it a huge amount of data to train and improve its AI. Waymo also has a full-stack approach, developing its own hardware and software, and using fully electric vehicles powered by renewable energy. Waymo is also one of the few companies that have obtained regulatory approval to operate without safety drivers in the vehicle, making it the first company to offer a truly driverless service to the public.\n\nWaymo has a huge potential to disrupt the transportation industry and create new revenue streams for Google. Waymo can offer a cheaper, safer, and more convenient alternative to traditional car ownership, ride-hailing, and public transit. Waymo can also leverage its technology to enter other markets, such as trucking, delivery, and logistics. Waymo is estimated to be worth over billions and could generate over $10 billion in annual revenue by 2030. \n\nGemini\n\nGemini is Google's newest and most ambitious AI project, aiming to create a general-purpose AI system that can understand and interact with any type of information. Gemini is built from the ground up for multimodality, meaning it can seamlessly reason across text, images, video, audio, and code. Gemini can also generate creative and innovative content, such as poems, stories, code, essays, songs, and more. \n\nGemini is a game-changer for Google and the world, as it can enable new possibilities and applications that were previously unimaginable. Gemini can enhance Google's existing products and services, such as Search, YouTube, Gmail, Maps, and more, by providing more accurate, relevant, and personalized results. Gemini can also create new products and services, such as education, entertainment, health, and more, by providing tailored and engaging experiences. Gemini can also empower users and developers, by allowing them to access, manipulate, and create any type of information with natural language and voice commands.\n\n\nConclusion\n\nGoogle is a powerhouse of innovation and growth, with a strong track record of delivering value to its shareholders. Google has a clear vision and strategy to leverage its AI capabilities to create new drugs, new modes of transportation, and new ways of interacting with information. Google is well-positioned to capitalize on the massive opportunities and challenges that lie ahead in the 21st century. Google is not just a search engine, it is a global leader in AI and a pioneer in the future of humanity.\n\n I am very bullish on Google and I think it is a must-have stock for any long-term investor.
