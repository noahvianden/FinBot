{"title": "Why are we making money?", "selftext": "  Hello fellow theta traders! I come to you today to hopefully invoke a discussion on what I believe to be a fundamental misunderstanding of why it appears as though many people on this sub are making a lot of gains this year. I’m not here to put anyone down or to invalidate any of the great success many traders have been having but instead I’d like to share my thoughts on how we as theta traders can continue to be profitable going forward regardless of market conditions. I’ll preface this by saying that I don’t claim to be an expert on any of this stuff. I could be completely off base here and if you feel like that’s the case, please share your opinion as well.\n\nFor me, the purpose of being a theta trader is to outperform the market in the long term. For sustainability, I aim to build a theta positive portfolio that will do well in an up market and can also do well in a down market. I believe at it's core, the overall market is extremely efficient. For every perceived reward, there is an equal amount of risk. Options are an excellent example of this. People often ask what DTE they should trade or what underlying or what strike. The answer is usually that it doesn’t matter because wherever you are gaining additional compensation, you are also taking on additional risk. The slight edge we have comes from the difference in perceived risk (implied volatility) and realized outcomes (actual volatility). On average, implied volatility is overstated which leads option prices to be slightly higher than they should be in a perfectly efficient market. This concept is why we have an edge. I believe that being a directional trader is a fallacy and a lot of people are directional traders without really realizing it. Nobody knows which way the market is going so to trade as if we do would be imprudent.\n\nAs theta traders, we sell insurance. Insurance companies also have an edge over the customer (otherwise why would they sell insurance??) The greater the risk of the buyer cashing in on that insurance, the greater the premium the buyer must pay. An insurance company that only insures houses in Florida will make a lot of money… until a hurricane comes. When selling insurance, companies make money because they spread out the risk enough that their premiums exceed the amount they pay out when things go bad. We must do the same as theta traders.\n\nI’ve seen a similar story pan out on quite a few posts lately. People have sold puts all year, sometimes intending to wheel them, and ended up making massive gains. Despite the title of /thetagang, many of the traders posting recently are showing huge success (sometimes as much as 100% annual gains) and it is not due to theta decay; it is due to having a delta positive portfolio in a market that has been very much on the upswing. To explain this, let’s take for example 3 traders using 3 different strategies. All of which would have done very well last year.\n\nA. A trader just selling puts that carries an average portfolio delta of around 150\n\nB. A trader just buying calls that carries an average portfolio delta of around 150\n\nC. A trader that just buys 150 shares of SPY.\n\nIn theory, these 3 traders made similar amounts of profit. (Trader A should make slightly more due to theta decay and an overall drop in implied volatility). The profitable result is not due to theta decay, it’s due primarily to being delta positive in a rising market. All 3 of these strategies would have done very poorly in a down market.\n\nSelling puts last year wasn’t why you made huge profits last year. You made profits by picking the market direction correctly.\n\nSo how do we create an option selling portfolio that will beat the market but won’t show massive losses when direction doesn’t go in our favor? By trying as much as possible to mitigate directional risk (delta) while maximizing gain from option decay (theta) and a decrease in volatility. All these people making massive gains this year will show massive losses in a down year UNLESS they take a different approach. A true theta producing portfolio will be near delta neutral or only slightly positive due to the natural tendency of the market to drift upwards. Strictly selling puts is a directional play. We must employ other strategies to benefit from the slight and only edge we have (implied vs realized volatility). If selling puts has worked for you so far that’s fantastic but look into delta neutral or even delta negative trades as well. A lasting portfolio is one that is diversified, not overexposed to large directional moves and takes advantage of times when implied volatility is elevated.\n\nAgain, this isn’t meant to discredit any of the positive gains people have had. If you had a great year last year good for you! As a community though I think it’s important that we all strive towards a goal where we can outperform the market with a sustainable portfolio that can handle all the inevitable ups and downs that may come.

Theta represents the rate at which the value of an option decreases as time passes, assuming all other factors remain constant. By targeting a specific percentage of NLV, the poster suggests managing risk while aiming for consistent returns.  \nShort Pvega but in the back months: Vega measures the sensitivity of an option's price to changes in the volatility of the underlying asset. \"Short Pvega\" means selling options with negative vega, which benefits from a decrease in volatility. Doing this in the \"back months\" refers to selling options with longer expiration dates (like 90 days to expiration, or DTE). This approach is typically less sensitive to short-term market movements.  \nSell 90DTE to take advantage of lower margin requirement: Selling options with 90 days until expiration (90DTE) can offer lower margin requirements compared to shorter-term options. Margin requirements are the amount of capital required in your account to maintain a trade. Longer-dated options often require less margin due to their slower rate of price change.  \nUse PM or/and SPAN: PM refers to Portfolio Margin, and SPAN is the Standard Portfolio Analysis of Risk system. Both are methods of calculating margin requirements that can allow for more efficient use of capital in a trading account, especially when trading options.  \nKeep all cash in T-Bill ladders or long SPX box spread ladders: This suggests investing any unallocated cash in Treasury Bill (T-Bill) ladders or \"long SPX box spread ladders.\" A T-Bill ladder involves buying T-Bills with different maturities to manage liquidity and interest rate risk. An SPX box spread ladder could involve a series of box spread trades on the S&P 500 index, structured to manage risk and potentially enhance returns.  \nOnly sell indexes or/and very liquid commodities: This strategy involves selling options only on broad market indexes (like the S&P 500) or highly liquid commodities. This is likely for reasons of liquidity (ease of entering and exiting trades) and lower risk compared to individual stocks.  \nThis will constantly generate profits in any market: The poster is suggesting that by following this strategy, one can potentially generate consistent profits regardless of market conditions. This is a bold claim and should be approached with caution, as all investment strategies carry risk, and there's no guarantee of profits.  \nIn summary, the post outlines a sophisticated options trading strategy focused on managing risk and generating consistent returns through a combination of specific option selling practices, margin management, and cash investment strategies.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "do you mean .1 to .4 Ptheta/NLV or do you mean .001 to .004 Ptheta/NLV ?\n\nlike should I calculate it like this?  \n\n\n>\\# Given values  \nptheta = xx  # Portfolio Theta  \nnlv = yy  # Net Liquidation Value  \n\\# Calculating Ptheta as a percentage of NLV  \nptheta\\_percent\\_of\\_nlv = (ptheta / nlv) \\* 100  \nptheta\\_percent\\_of\\_nlv", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Something like that but Dr Jim will explain it much better than me: https://youtu.be/8KN6pazdUlg?si=bni-5Sq_2YOwHvt9", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "fall voracious normal work strong lush paint alleged terrific grey\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)*", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "Not everyone bothers with learning trade management chops regarding what to do with a tested short put if you look at the average \"What do I do?!\" post here.

It is most certainly not a win in every scenario trade but it does offer protection both on the downside and on the upside.  At the start of this trade it is slightly delta positive and will show immediate unrealized losses if the underlying goes down.  As the trade carries out though and the naked puts decay, the trade starts to become more delta neutral or even delta negative.  Common practice is to close out the naked puts early at a given price target while leaving the put debit spread open for downside protection on future trades.  If the entire trade shows an unrealized loss equal to the maximum gain including the trap, I close the whole thing for a loss.
