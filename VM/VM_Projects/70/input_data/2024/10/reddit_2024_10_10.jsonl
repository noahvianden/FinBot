Wouldn't you rather look at a stock earnings beats rate as a measurement for actually meeting or missing expectations then a yapping approach without any evidence of existence? The result is also a bunch of assumptions that are horribly wrong why would an investor of high growth companies switch to low growth companies?\n\n>The same thing happens in a bubble, and it is no secret that AI is a bubble as of now considering the ludicrous difference in implicit and intrinsic valuations.¬†\n\nBased on what data? What actual measurements are you using? let's stop talking how you feel and start talking about what you calculated here and by how much exactly do you think something specific is overvalued and go from there. If you sit down and actually start using numbers not vibes you will have a far better understanding of all the things you say than now. Please do not use sites precalculate things as they do not work.\n\n>Looking at NVDA, it is easy to see how we could be looking at the first half of a repeat of the 3D Printing bubble in 2014. ¬†\n\nIf it's so easy and you're correct investors in aggregate would not create a bubble. So either a bubble is not as easy to spot or you're wrong.\n\n>We are too late to invest in growth stocks and too early to buy value stocks, so we are faced with a dilemma:¬†\n\nClassically value stocks carry higher risk and have higher return while growth stocks carry less risk and less returns over time. A value stock is a company that is valued below valuation metrics because it has many problems. Not sure why you think value stocks should be more desirable as they're interwoven with pain holding them. Growth stocks by their characteristics are always more desirable.\n\n>How can we invest on the tipping point of the economy‚Äôs growth?¬†\n\nYou cannot. Nobody can. Look at Michael Berry with his sell tweets.\n\n>**To be honest, I have no f\\*cking clue**...\n\n>**What is certain, however**, is that NVDA, sooner or later...\n\nHow can you have no clue and be certain. That my friend is called cognitive dissonance. You one hand say you understand that you have no clue on the other hand you make many bold assumptions and statements with sheer endless confiance. You either need to be less confident about your knowledge if you have no clue or increase your knowledge so you have a clue and the confidence is justified.

Stocks have a risk-return relation so you cannot have higher returns with less risk. You can maybe argue that a single stock has so much more risk than return and anther one has optimal risk return but in aggregate that is just a false statement. You can have an optimally risk adjusted portfolio of stocks but for a single stock the perception of risk and return are directly related.\n\n[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1059056023002538](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1059056023002538)\n\n>Investors in aggregate also love to create bubbles, this is due to FOMO, hot-hand fallacy and the belief that their always the first to find the Ponzi Scheme.\n\nYou have some evidence of that because it sounds like you feel a certain way about something that again is not correct.\n\n>Also, saying that NVDA will never have a correction is pretty stupid in my humble opinion.
