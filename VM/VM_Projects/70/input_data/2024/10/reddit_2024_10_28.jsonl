RIV is currently trading around 11BN market cap w/ $7+bn cash on hand as of Q2\n\n2. Investment in VW, the subsequent launch of Scout (which looks to be a lot of Riv tech) an the closing of VW Germany shows me that RIV could be a huge piece of VW's play (currently $50BN market cap)\n\n3.

In this case, RIVN takes the win IMO because they will get paid for two sku's (their R1 line and the Scout line). If VW plans on using RIVN body and tech but do it on their own, I would put a late 2028 timeline for first deliveries for Scout.  \n\n  \nTo compare - Chevy, Ram and Ford took \\~1-2 years from announcement to first customer deliveries. This is extremely impressive, and would credit some of that to having existing pickup data, production lines etc. It took Tesla 4 years from announcement to delivery (and around the time they announced the Cybertruck - late 2019 - their market cap was comparable to VW's today). \n\n**On Price:**  \nFor similar reasons above, I think if VW are running the production line, it's definitely over the $60K purchase target.
