{"title": "What is happening in the uranium sector? ", "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\n**A summery of a couple important points**\n\nThe uranium sector is in a growing global uranium supply deficit that can't be solved in a couple of years time, while:\n\n* recently the biggest uranium producing country of the world, Kazakhstan, made a 17% cut in the previously promised production level for 2025 and also hinting on lower production levels for 2026 and beyond than previously hoped.\n* followed by additional production cuts from other uranium producers (Uranium mining is hard)\n* recently Putin started the threat of soon restricting uranium deliveries to the West, meaning Russian uranium, Russian enriched uranium, uranium from Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan that goes through Russia to the port of Saint Petersburg.\n* followed by Kazatomprom (Kazakhstan) stating that uranium deliveries to the West has become difficult and could become even more difficult in the future (--> Putin's threat)\n* Microsoft paying for 100% of electricity from the Three Mile Island reactor they asked Constellation to restart in 2028 = That's unexpected additional uranium demand for delivery in 2025.\n* Uranium demand is price inelastic\n* The inventory created in 2011-2017 (when uranium sector was in oversupply) that helped to solve the structural global deficit starting early 2018, is now depleted! (Confirmed by UxC)\n* Followed by additional production start delays (Zuuvch Ovoo, Orano)\n\n**A couple points more in detail:**\n\n**A.** There is an important difference between how demand reacts when uranium price goes up compared to when gas price goes up.\n\n**B.** The evolution from oversupply in 2011-2017 to a structural global deficit since early 2018 and growing in the future\n\n**C.** A month ago Kazatomprom announced a **17% cut in the hoped production for 2025 in Kazakhstan**, the Saudi-Arabia of uranium + hinting for additional production cuts in 2026 and beyond\n\nA. B & C are explained in my previous post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1f77a6h/17\\_cut\\_in\\_expected\\_production\\_2025\\_in\\_kazakhstan/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1f77a6h/17_cut_in_expected_production_2025_in_kazakhstan/)\n\n**Kazatomprom, Cameco, Orano, CGN, ..., and a couple smaller uranium producers are all selling more uranium to clients than they produce**. Meaning that they will soon all together try to buy uranium through the illiquide uranium spotmarket, while the biggest uranium supplier of the spotmarket (Uranium One) has less uranium to sell now.\n\nAnd the less uranium producers deliver to clients (utilities), the more clients will have to find uranium in the spotmarket themself.\n\nThere is no way around this. Producers and/or clients, someone is going to buy a significant volume of uranium in the illiquide spotmarket during the new high season in the uranium sector.\n\nAnd before that production cut announcement of Kazakhstan, **the global uranium supply problem** looked like this:\n\npage 10 of this presentation: [https://prod.cameco.com/sites/default/files/documents/Cameco-Investor-Presentation.pdf](https://prod.cameco.com/sites/default/files/documents/Cameco-Investor-Presentation.pdf)\n\n\n\n**D. Now: additional important delay in world uranium production => Orano is in trouble to honor their LT uranium supply commitments to their clients**\n\nThe Zuuvch Ovoo uranium mine of Orano is delayed by at least 2 years!\n\nThis was an important uranium project.\n\nThat's a loss of 14Mlb! (2\\*7Mlb/y)\n\n[Source: @z\\_axis\\_capital, by comparing 2 announcements in 2024, latest yesterday](https://preview.redd.it/brv9rvb59ctd1.jpg?width=954&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=613d25abe3916402e053bf4de3eeb1bd5822c7d7)\n\nOrano is a major uranium producers. They have a serious problem.\n\nThey lost uranium production in Niger in 2023/2024, they lost the Imouraren uranium project in Niger in 2024, and now this delay in production start of Zuuvch uranium mine.\n\nOrano already had to buy uranium in the spotmarket to be able to honor their supply commitements. But now they will have to buy even more in the very tight uranium spotmarket\n\n**E. 2 triggers (=> Break out of uranium price starting this week imo)**\n\na) This week (October 1st) the new uranium purchase budgets of US utilities will be released.\n\nWith all latest announcements (big production cuts from Kazakhstan, uranium supply warning from Kazatomprom, Putin's threat on restricting uranium supply to the West, UxC confirming that inventory X is now depleted, additional announcements of lower uranium production from other uranium suppliers the last week, ...), those new budgets will be significantly bigger than the previous ones.\n\nb) The last \\~6 months LT contracting has been largely postponed by utilities (only \\~40Mlb contracted so far) due to uncertainties they first wanted to have clarity on.\n\nNow there is more clarity. By consequence they will now accelerate the LT contracting and uranium buying\n\nThe upward pressure on the uranium spot and LT price is about to increase significantly\n\nJust after October 1st, we got the first information of a lot of RFP's being launched!\n\n**F. LT uranium supply contracts signed today are with a 80-85USD/lb floor price and a 125-130USD/lb ceiling price escalated with inflation.**\n\nAlthough the uranium spotprice is the price most investors look at, in the sector most of the uranium is delivered through LT contracts using a combination of LT price escalated to inflation and spot related price at the time of delivery.\n\nHere a link to the Uranium LT price: [https://www.cameco.com/invest/markets/uranium-price](https://www.cameco.com/invest/markets/uranium-price)\n\nThe global uranium shortage is structural and can't be solved in a couple of years time, not even when the uranium price would significantly increase from here, because the problem is the needed time to explore, develop and build a lot of new mines!\n\nDuring the low season (around March till around September) the upward pressure on the uranium spot price weakens and the uranium spot price goes a bit down to be closer to the LT uranium price.\n\nIn the high season (around September till around March) the upward pressure on the uranium spot price increases again and the uranium spot price goes back up faster than the month over month price increase of the LT uranium price\n\nThe official LT price is update once a month at the end of the month.\n\n**LT uranium supply contracts signed today (September) are with a 80-85USD/lb floor price and a 125-130USD/lb ceiling price escalated with inflation.**\n\n=> an average of 105 USD/lb\n\nWhile the uranium LT price of end August 2024 was 81 USD/lb. Today TradeTech announced a new uranium LT price of 82 USD/lb, while Cameco announces a 81.5 LT uranium price of end September 2024.\n\nBy consequence there is a high probability that not only the uranium spotprice will increase faster coming weeks with activity picking up in the sector, but also that uranium LT price is going to jump higher in coming months compared to the 81.5 USD/lb of end September 2024.\n\nHere is a fragment of a report of Cantor Fitzgerald written before the Kazak uranium supply warning, before the uranium supply threat from Putin, and before the additional cuts in 2024 productions from other uramium suppliers (look at my comment)\n\n**G. Russia is preparing a long list of export curbs**\n\nAfter the announcement of the huge (17%) cut in the planned production for 2025 and beyond of the biggest uranium producer of the world (Kazakhstan: \\~45% of world production), now Putin asked his people to look into the possibilities to restrict some commodities export to the Western countries, explicitely mentioning uranium\n\n[https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274654518/russia-could-ban-export-of-vital-resources-to-west-deputy-pm](https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274654518/russia-could-ban-export-of-vital-resources-to-west-deputy-pm)\n\n**H. The uranium spot price increase that slowely started a week ago is now accelerating (some stakeholders have been frontrunning the 2 triggers starting previous week)**\n\nAlthough the uranium LT price is much more important for the sector, most investors look at the uranium spotprice.\n\nHere a link to the uranium spotprice on Numerco: [https://numerco.com/NSet/aCNSet.html](https://numerco.com/NSet/aCNSet.html)\n\n**The uranium lbs available for spotselling are very scarce now, while all major uranium producers are short uranium and need to find lbs elsewhere (spot) to be able to honor their supply commitments**\n\nCauses:\n\na) Uranium One (100% production from Kazakhstan) producing less uranium than previously hoped by many (Utilities, Intermediaries, other producers). So less primary production to sell in spot\n\nb) Inventory X, created in 2011-2017 that solved the annual primary deficit since early 2018, is now mathematically depleted. (Confirmed by UxC)\n\nc) Utilities and Intermediaries increasing their minimum operational inventory levels due to the growing uranium supply insecurity => With supply uncertainties, utilities typically increase their inventory and decrease sale to others\n\nInvestors underestimate the impact of Russian threat alone. The threat alone (without effectively going through with it) is sufficient for utilities to go from supply security to supply insecurity.\n\nUtilities and Intermediaries trade uranium between each other. But with supply uncertainties, utilities typically increase their inventory and decrease sale to others\n\n**The last commercially available lbs will become unavailable before even being sold!**\n\n**I. Sprott Physical Uranium Trust** (U.UN and U.U on TSX) is a fund 100% invested in physical uranium stored at specialised warehouses for uranium (only a couple places in the world). **Here the investor is not exposed to mining related risks.**\n\nSprott Physical Uranium Trust website: [https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/physical-commodity-funds/uranium/](https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/physical-commodity-funds/uranium/)\n\nThe uranium LT price just increased to 81.50 USD/lb, while uranium spotprice started to increase the last couple of trading days of previous week.\n\nUranium spotprice is now at 82.63 USD/lb\n\nA share price of Sprott Physical Uranium Trust U.UN at 27.60 CAD/share or 20.33 USD/sh represents an uranium price of 82.63 USD/lb\n\nFor instance, before the production cuts announced by Kazakhstan and before Putin's threat too restrict uranium supply to the West, Cantor Fitzgerald estimated that the uranium spotprice will reach 120 USD/lb, 130 USD/lb in 2025 and 140 USD/lb in 2026. Knowing a couple important factors in the sector today (UxC confirming that inventory X is indeed depleted now) find this estimate for 2024/2025 modest, but ok.\n\nAn uranium spotprice of 120 USD/lb in the coming months (imo) gives a NAV for U.UN of \\~40.00 CAD/sh or \\~29.60 USD/sh.\n\nAnd with all the additional uranium supply problems announced the last weeks, I would not be surprised to see the uranium spotprice reach 150 USD/lb in Q4 2024 / Q1 2025, because uranium demand is price inelastic and we are about to enter the high season in the uranium sector.\n\n**J.** **A couple uranium sector ETF's**:\n\n* Sprott Uranium Miners ETF (URNM): 100% invested in the uranium sector\n* Global X Uranium index ETF (HURA): 100% invested in the uranium sector\n* Sprott Junior Uranium Miners ETF (URNJ): 100% invested in the junior uranium sector\n* Global X Uranium ETF (URA): 70% invested in the uranium sector\n\nI posting now, in the early days of the high season in the uranium sector that started in September and that will now hit the accelerator (Oct 1st), and not 2 months later when we will be well in the high season\n\n**This isn't financial advice.
