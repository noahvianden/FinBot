Today the stock is over $6000 split adjusted and 3.5 trillion!!\n\nSo what's going to drive the overall market growth in the next decade?

Yes, I have an Iphone, everyone you know has an iphone and Apple's cultural impact is undeniable. But realistically, Apple is not an important company in the same way NVDA is.

These replicants are designed to perform tasks that humans either cannot or do not want to do, such as dangerous labor in off-world colonies. Replicants are virtually indistinguishable from humans but are given limited lifespans (typically four years).\n\t•\tBlade Runners: The story follows Rick Deckard, a “blade runner,” who is part of a special police unit tasked with hunting down and “retiring” (a euphemism for killing) replicants who escape to Earth, as they are banned from the planet due to fears of rebellion or violence.\n\t•\tThemes of Identity and Humanity: The film explores profound philosophical themes related to the nature of humanity, consciousness, and the ethics of creating life. Replicants are portrayed as struggling with their predetermined lifespans and often exhibit more humanity and emotional depth than their human counterparts, raising questions about what it truly means to be human.\n\nDystopian Elements:\n\n\t•\tEnvironmental Decline: The world of Blade Runner is depicted as grim and polluted, with constant rain, poor air quality, and minimal natural elements. The Earth is shown to be a declining planet, with many humans migrating to off-world colonies.\n\t•\tClass Divide: There is a stark contrast between the wealthy, powerful elite (such as Tyrell) who live in high towers above the city and the struggling masses in the overpopulated, dilapidated streets below.\n\t•\tTechnological Overload: Society is dominated by large corporations and filled with towering, neon advertisements, showcasing how commercialism and technological advancements have saturated daily life.\n\nBlade Runner is now regarded as one of the greatest science fiction films of all time for its exploration of these themes, its striking visual style, and its lasting impact on the genre.", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "That smog was really drawn from Beijing, LA, London in the 1800s.
