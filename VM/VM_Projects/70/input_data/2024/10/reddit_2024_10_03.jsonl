{"title": "Here’s How Bad China’s Economy Really Is. Can It Be Fixed?", "selftext": "_china don’t care_ so now that Uncle Xi clearly does care all the new bling bling it shows how fukt things got\n\n> excepts from center of the editorial\n\n> China’s $18 trillion economy has been struggling across a range of sectors. Manufacturing activity, as of September, has been in contraction since April 2023, bar three months. Exacerbating the outlook are US efforts to cut China off from supplies of advanced semiconductors and other technologies set to drive future economic growth — an approach that officials in Washington call “strategic competition” and China decries as “containment.” Confidence at home became so fragile that China’s bank loans to the real economy shrank this summer for the first time in 19 years. The balance sheets of cash-strapped local governments, which are already laden with hidden debt, are among the casualties of slumping property prices. Their revenue from land sales has been declining at a record clip, making it harder to reverse a drop in budget expenditure just when economy is in dire need of fiscal support.\n\n> Optimism was high as China exited pandemic curbs in late 2022 and reopened its borders that the nation would see a rapid recovery in consumer spending fueled by “revenge shopping,” eating out and travel. That boost failed to materialize as people fretted about what weak growth means for unemployment and incomes. The years-long real estate crisis also wiped out an estimated $18 trillion in wealth from households, prompting people to save rather than spend and pushing China into its longest streak of deflation since 1999. Chinese consumption edged up slightly during a major holiday in September, adding to signs the rebound in spending by households still had a way to go. \n\n> Unemployment remains a concern, made worse by a regulatory crackdown on big technology companies that deprived many young, ambitious graduates of a lucrative career path. The youth jobless rate rose in August for the second straight month to its highest level this year.\n\n> Real estate has been the main engine of China’s economic growth since President Xi Jinping came to office a decade ago. The government attempted to crack down on heavily indebted developers in 2020 to reduce risks to the financial system. That pushed house prices down and many weaker companies defaulted. Many developers stopped building homes they had already sold but hadn’t yet delivered, prompting some people to stop paying their mortgages. This turbulence was a wakeup call for many Chinese, who have long considered property a sure-bet investment and used it as a store of wealth. The pain continued into 2024, extending a trend of declines in place since early 2022. In May, China unveiled its most far-reaching attempt to revive the property market. But progress has been slow on plans that include a program to provide 300 billion yuan ($43 billion) of central bank funding to help government-backed firms buy unsold homes from developers. And given the unattractive economics of the plan for local authorities, only a fraction of more than 200 cities urged to participate by the central government are heeding the call to help absorb an excess of housing. \n\ntldr; young generation fukt, no consumers, deflation, housing/housing banking rekt\n", "id": "1fv5oh7", "created_utc": 1727955759.0, "score": 59, "upvote_ratio": 0.68, "num_comments": 76, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 10 | **First Seen In WSB** | 3 years ago\n**Total Comments** | 2246 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 8 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I had thought that the Chinese were sacrificing the economy at the highest levels in an attempt to make it sanction proof in preparation for a Taiwan invasion", "score": 44, "replies": [{"body": "It will come as a shock and a surprise to people in this subreddit, but not all leaders care about the economy, economics, or even the economic well-being of their people.\n\nConsider this op-ed.\n\n[https://www.ft.com/content/4079c3f7-75f0-4d5e-9c9d-bc673d26cfd9](https://www.ft.com/content/4079c3f7-75f0-4d5e-9c9d-bc673d26cfd9)\n\n>Kasparov thinks the issue is a tendency to presume that everyone else shares your innate world view. The key here is western ideas of motive and rationality. Western culture is soaked in a capitalist ethos, underpinned by a widespread assumption that the profit motive rules supreme in terms of shaping political calculations, and that it’s “the economy, stupid” that drives decision-making in Russia and elsewhere. The collapse of the USSR reinforced this view, since it seemed that market principles and global business interests had triumphed.\n\n>As a consequence, western leaders and business groups generally turned a blind eye when Putin gave speeches that clearly demonstrated his nationalist, expansionist agenda and then annexed Crimea. Worse, they failed to appreciate how isolated Putin had become. Instead, as Russian oligarchs became a fixture of global business, Putin was seen as an extrapolation of this group. ***The idea that he might be so hell-bent on the destruction of democracy and the expansion of Russia that he would be willing to accept deep economic pain wasn’t taken seriously.***\n\nTBH, Xi is in exactly the same place.

Especially in light of the lack of success Russia has had. \n\nThe CCP has seen first hand how new Russian weapons fare against decommissioned and older NATO weapons platforms. It’s not pretty. \n\nUndoubtedly the CCP has systems developed that the west hasn’t seen. And those systems might provide an edge in a lightning attack and amphibious invasion but if the PLA and PLAN aren’t able to assert complete control across Taiwan their edge will be gone and they will get a taste of NATO’s newest platforms. \n\nIf the CCP can quickly control all of Taiwan the question of foreign intervention becomes murky. A stout defense of the Island would likewise buy the time the west needs to build a coalition and bring in the devil dogs. Taiwan is exactly the type of war Marines are made for.\n\nSo clearly the CCP needs a non-peer military to test themselves against. They don’t need to invade the Philippines, Vietnam or Japan to fight a limited engagement over a few islands, so the west will yell but not strike. \n\nBhutan has no military to speak of and no navy so the lessons there will be logistical. Assuming India doesn’t want to scrap, the west will again be vocal but do nothing.
