Scott Rubner, the bank's managing director of global markets and a tactical expert, expects this benchmark index of U.S. stocks could end the year well above 6,000. His calculations of data going back to 1928 found that the median historical return for the S&P 500 between Oct. 15 and Dec. 31 was 5.17%.
