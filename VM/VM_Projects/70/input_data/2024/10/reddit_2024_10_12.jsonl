Not bad at all.\n\n*****\n\nTo estimate the cost a distributor might charge for individual components of the NVIDIA DGX B200, excluding the GPUs, we can break it down as follows:\n\n\t1.\tDual Intel Xeon® Platinum 8570 Processors:\n\t•\tThe Intel Xeon Platinum 8570 is part of Intel’s high-end server CPU lineup. These CPUs typically cost around $7,000 to $9,000 each, depending on the distributor.\n\t•\tTotal cost for 2 CPUs: $14,000 - $18,000.\n\t2.\tMotherboard (Supporting Dual Xeon CPUs, PCIe for GPUs, NVMe SSD support):\n\t•\tHigh-end server motherboards that support dual Xeon processors, have multiple PCIe slots, and are optimized for AI workloads can range from $1,500 to $3,000.\n\t•\tEstimated motherboard cost: $1,500 - $3,000.\n\t3.\tMemory (4TB DDR5):\n\t•\tDDR5 memory is still relatively expensive, and 4TB is a massive amount. High-capacity server-grade memory modules (such as RDIMM or LRDIMM) are typically priced around $4,000 to $5,000 per terabyte, depending on speed and reliability.\n\t•\tTotal cost for 4TB DDR5: $16,000 - $20,000.\n\t4.\tStorage (2x 1.92TB NVMe M.2 SSDs and 8x 3.84TB NVMe SSDs):\n\t•\tHigh-performance enterprise NVMe SSDs are generally priced between $400 and $800 for 1.92TB models and around $1,000 - $2,000 for 3.84TB models.\n\t•\tCost for 2x 1.92TB NVMe M.2 SSDs: $800 - $1,600.\n\t•\tCost for 8x 3.84TB NVMe SSDs: $8,000 - $16,000.\n\t5.\tNetworking and Other Miscellaneous Components:\n\t•\tThe system will have high-speed networking capabilities, likely involving NVIDIA’s own networking components, which could include Infiniband or 100GbE network adapters. These typically cost between $2,000 and $5,000, depending on the configuration.\n\t•\tEstimated cost for networking: $2,000 - $5,000.\n\nTotal Estimate (Excluding GPUs):\n\n\t•\tCPUs: $14,000 - $18,000\n\t•\tMotherboard: $1,500 - $3,000\n\t•\tMemory: $16,000 - $20,000\n\t•\tStorage: $8,800 - $17,600\n\t•\tNetworking & Miscellaneous: $2,000 - $5,000\n\nTotal cost estimate: $42,300 - $63,600\n\nThis is a rough estimate based on the current market prices for high-end server components.

{"title": "Things I've learned trading 0DTE options for the last 6 months. Not much", "selftext": "I'm writing this mainly to digest what I've learned and as something to reference back on in case I lose my way later.\n\nMaybe it can help someone else, most of you will say of course these things are obvious.\n\nTLDR - I need to pick closer to ITM strikes. Watching VIX helps but I am missing the fact that each ticker also has a Volatility component. (how to watch this?) EDIT : $1000 cash account\n\nI've spent the last \\~6 months day trading 0-4dte options, basically buying calls or puts and attempting to quickly scalp out some profit.\n\nMainly I've attempted this with 0dte SPY options, but I have also traded in a few highly liquid tickers also, but always as low a dte as I can get.\n\nThe reason I landed in this area of trading is my available cash in my cash account is typically less than $1000. This makes it challenging due to the following reasons.\n\n1. Attempting to find a sweet spot of lower cost options but that will move in price enough before decaying away.\n2. Trading this way I found I needed to trade 5-10 contracts to get more cash per .01 movement in the option price.\n3. Due to the low amount of capitol my risk is tight. I try to keep it at $30 stop per trade, this makes the stop tight, probably too tight.\n4. Volatility is the one ring to rule them all.\n5. I trade between 5-10 contracts , with such low priced options the commission costs do work against me more than I'd like.\n\nNo matter how many videos I watched or how much I read about the Greeks it still didn't fully translate in my brain on the effects it would have on the price during a trade.\n\nFor example I knew TSLA was going to continue lower after the bad press from the event. So I setup to buy 10 PUT contracts.\n\nThis did go in my favor at first but quickly the stock hit -10% for the day which triggered SSR (short sale restricted), ahhh something else to keep in mind when trying to catch a move.\n\nDue to my already tight stops I pick a strike priced between $.10-$.30 per contract. This is also  an attempt to keep some dry powder for more trades before my buying power is exhausted for the day. This is a big problem I've finally realized!\n\nIt goes back to #1, the options with those lower prices are too far OTM to move much in price. Because the gamma is already low, the price of the contracts doesn't move enough without an unusually large move or if the price is helped by Volatility going up at the same time.\n\nWith this TSLA trade the VIX was sinking at the same time the stock was going down, so the option price wasn't moving very much. I could have sold out at $.15 for a $40 profit on my $.11 contract price, but it only touched that price once before falling due to the SSR bounce and then volatility continued to fall so even when TSLA did some pull backs the price of the option wasn't moving back up again. So this is a huge lesson, combined falling Volatility and time decay causes prices to mainly go down. Result , lost $100 by waiting for a bounce back in my options price. Stupid, didn't set my stop!\n\nThe price movement in far OTM options has been my biggest sticking point, the light is finally coming on in my brain.\n\nI need to take a bit more risk with closer to ITM strikes in order to catch the move.\n\nBut if I leave my stop at only $30 per trade then I would have to be right on direction immediately , any further move against me will stop out often.\n\nOne last thing I've observed, at least when trading SPY, the Put side seems like it's easier to catch due to the fact VIX is usually going up at the same time and helping the options price go up while the SPY price is falling. But lately SPY is rarely falling, it's been slowly grinding higher most days.

Have about 100 trades on SPY / $SPX under my belt over past 3 months and flat P&L (I have mostly been paying Schwab). \n\nFWIW, here my thoughts \n\nSize in at 1 - 3 contracts max and usually hold for < 30 minutes. Goal is to minimize impact of Theta decay. The last hour of session Theta on 0DTE is sizzling so I try to avoid any trades there. Sweet spot as you said is 9:45 to 11:15 AM.\n\nWorking off 5 minute charts, but is usually good to geolocate on higher timeframes (15 Min, 1 HR, 1D).  \n\nStrike ATM or slightly ITM (Delta of 0.5 to 0.6 is good). \n\nMonitoring of Market Internals (VOLD, VOLX (VIX Futures) and TICK) are key. From these I can attempt to gauge if we are in trending or ranging trading regime. \n\nKey Indicators \n\nRSI / Stochastics / rVol (relative volume - which is a superpower Indicator IMO) and On Balance Volume. \n\nTypically I am looking for mean reversion setups with a potential price move in underlying of $0.75 to $1.0. Usually I am aiming for price pullback or jump to VWAP or 21 period MA, but also there have been bull or bear runs where you just let the train take you up or down. Patience here is key.\n\nAs you noted Stop Loss / Trailing Stop / Target Price and position management has been a challenge.

Have you considered selling instead of buying?  \n\nThe way you're doing it, theta decay has destroyed the option value so close to expiration that you're gambling on some high volatility move at the last minute to make money.  Not a very good strategy.  If you sell you then have theta decay *consistently* working for you so close to expiration.  The goal in selling is to find overpriced options and short them.  Simple as that.\n\nWhat I've noticed is you're buying options at pennies per contract.  This is typically something a short seller would do to close their positions.  On or near expiration, we close out our trades and buy back for pennies with the exact opposite reason of what you're doing:  we want to protect ourselves from some high volatility spikes at the last minute which would cause the option price to expire in the money and get assigned.\n\nOn a separate note, I've learned from my own trading never to take the risk and allow a position to expire worthless.  Even if that's the unstated goal of option shorting, to collect the full premium, what difference does it make if I buy back for pennies instead of completing the full mission?  So what I lost a few potential dollars.  I say this because I'm reminded of Intel when news came out at the very last minute with the takeover offer.  The stock skyrocketed and many short option sellers got screwed at the very end.\n\nBuyers like you would have reaped a massive reward in this case but finding and gambling on moves like this is low probability wins.
