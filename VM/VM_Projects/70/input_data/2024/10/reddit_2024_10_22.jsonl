Depreciation impacts cash flows not at all.  \n\nIf they are this profitable to shareholders with this caped spend, dividends up?", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "The problem is when large tech companies engage in round tripping to create the illusion of strong cash flows and earnings, without actually producing any outside business activity.\n\nFor example, you make a $2 Billion investment in an AI startup, contingent on them spending it on your cloud AI service.\n\nYou spend $2 Billion on H100's/GB200's, which are considered capex, so no expense yet. You then record $2 Billion on your balance sheet for the GPUs you bought. The $2 Billion in cash you invested in the startup gets recorded as an equity method investment. You then record their cloud spending with your money as \"revenue\"\n\nThe result:\n\n1. Initial impact on the balance sheet is a wash, because cash becomes GPUs(capital asset), and the investment in the company is valued at the purchase price.\n\n2. Initially, you show revenue growth and earnings growth in your AI division, because the company you gave money is giving money back to you to use your AI cloud service.\n\n3. The \"value\" of these investments can grow because of a new funding round at a higher valuation, even if the fundamentals are still terrible.\n\n4.  The quarterly depreciation on GPU purchases can be obscured by ramping up the rate of AI investment, which is exactly what large tech companies like Microsoft are doing. This continues the illusion of organic growth.\n\nSo far, tech companies have been able to obscure their AI losses due to the growth in their existing products, which came from past investments in non-ai products.
