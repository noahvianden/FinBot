The applications for AI are insane, so that's basically a massive industry Nvidia will dominate because of their initial investment into hardware development.\n\nMeta is a *very very* good customer of Nvidia, and Meta is not the only one.

AI, in particular, has become a major transformative force globally, and NVIDIA’s hardware is central to making those AI advancements possible. Investors are betting on the immense potential of these technologies to redefine industries and create value far beyond traditional measures of inventory or locations.

Can you give me an example?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Sure… say you sold a covered call on TSLA for $240.  It’s ITM and it expires on Friday.  You want to roll it to get some extra premium out of the position.  So select to roll for 2 weeks in this example.  \n\nCurrently the:\n\n$240 1 Nov call is $23.50\n\n$240 15 Nov call is about $28.50\n\nSo you’d roll that for $5 additional premium.  Or $500 for one contract.  \n\nSo you’ve got $24,000 locked up in this contract because once it exercises you’re getting $24,000 for the 100 shares at the strike of $240.  \n\nSo if you elect to roll the contract out for 2 weeks you’ll get $500.  There are 26 two week periods in a year.  So in effect your APR on that $24,000 locked up in those TSLA shares is:\n\n$500 / $24,000 x 26 (x100). =  54%.  \n\nSo provided TSLA stays above the strike you’re getting 54% Annual Percentage Yeild on the money tied up in that stock.  It’s not killing it but it’s not too damn bad either.  \n\nSure people will say you’re close one contract for a loss and opening a separate option contract that will have a gain so you’re taking a loss.  Well who gives a shit.  You’re increasing your premium harvest on the position at a pretty decent APR.  of course TSLA price could slide and you could end up keeping the shares.  But you liked it in the first place so that’s okay.  \n\nOne potential issue is the opportunity cost.  If TSLA moons then taking that money and buying more shares could do better.  However, that does carry some additional risk.  If it pulls back from your new buy price you dont get to keep the premium of the rolled out covered call.  When I don’t roll anymore is when the effective APR gets low enough that it just doesn’t make sense.  This happens the deeper it goes ITM.  So when it’s down to like 30-35% it just doesn’t seem attractive enough to tie up that cash.  Now you could always hope for an early exercise and when they get deep enough ITM that can certainly happen and that’s just icing on the cake.  Keep the premium and get the cash out that’s tied up in the shares.  The market has been ripping so I’ve got a few I’m keeping my fingers crossed right now on an early exercise.  \n\nHere is one nice thing about the roll and taking a loss on the initial covered call… if you do this at the end of the year you will have a contract trade that nets a loss… deduct that against gains at tax time and you roll that new option into the new year those gains when the stock does finally get called away go into the next year.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "You hit max profit on your trade, you should be happy.
