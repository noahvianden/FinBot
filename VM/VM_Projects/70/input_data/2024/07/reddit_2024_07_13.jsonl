{"title": "Airbus buy now profit later?", "selftext": "Hi. Recently bought 90 shares of Airbus @131 euro. I bought this as a safer part of my portfolio as I'm not expecting massive gains but feel it has a large moat and the potential to shine due to Boeings problems. Peaking in the 170s quite recently it's trading at quite a discount and a feel Airbus has a chance to improve margins as it can ask more for products whilst Boeing can't deliver on time and when it can doubts arise over quality issues. The current woes of Boeing won't show up as positives in Airbus results untill the aircraft are delivered and profits are booked. In my opinion this is a safe long term investment.

No company with a little sense of profit would do this shit. They had to develop the A600 Beluga to transport fuselages across Europe for this nonsense - and while many cargo companies YEARN for this plane, Airbus is not selling it to anyone.\n\nAirbus lost its path, its vision.

Airbus supply chain is fucked up, that is not an internal Airbus issue, but primarily stems from turbine deliveries, which Airbus does not even produce.\n\nThey produce superior planes when compared to boeing, to the extent that Boeing had to botch the 737 max together because they completely missed the mark and were unable to compete with the A320 neo. With known consequences.\n\nBoeings military contracts are how old? Jdams since the 90s, B-52 contracts, C-17, all new contracts go to Northrop or Lockheed.
