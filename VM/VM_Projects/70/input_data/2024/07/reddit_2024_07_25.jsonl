Berkshire still owns 980.1 million Bank of America shares with a market value of $41.3 billion, a distant second to its $172.5 billion holding in Apple.\n\nBerkshire is required to disclose its stock moves within two business days after they are made, when the stake in any company exceeds 10%.\n\nBuffett could be trimming the bet on valuation concerns after Charlotte-based Bank of America outperformed the broader market this year. The bank stock is up more than 25% in 2024, compared to almost 14% for the S&P 500.\n\nIt marked the first time since the fourth quarter of 2019 that Berkshire cut its Bank of America stake. In 2011, the Oracle of Omaha bought $5 billion worth of the bank‚Äôs preferred stock and warrants to shore up confidence in the lender as it grappled with losses related to subprime mortgages in the aftermath of the financial crisis.\n\nJust last year, Buffett spoke highly of the leadership at Bank of America, even as he offloaded other financial names. In 2022, Berkshire exited a handful of longtime bank positions, including JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo and U.S. Bancorp. \n\n‚ÄúI invited myself in, many years earlier, and they made a very decent deal for us. And I like Brian Moynihan enormously, and I just don‚Äôt want to, I don‚Äôt want to sell it,‚Äù Buffett said in 2023 of holding Bank of America.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/25/berkshire-dumps-2point3-billion-of-bank-of-america-in-a-6-day-sale-.html", "id": "1ebwo2i", "created_utc": 1721918692.0, "score": 719, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 72, "comments": [{"body": "Dumped isn‚Äôt really the right word when you‚Äôre taking a profit on the transaction.", "score": 256, "replies": [{"body": "An it‚Äôs only like 5-6% of the total shares they own.", "score": 74, "replies": [{"body": "‚ÄúI dumped my girlfriend.
