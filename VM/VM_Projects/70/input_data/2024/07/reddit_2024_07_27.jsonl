{"title": "NVDA YOLO - We win by keeping our heads on when others lose theirs", "selftext": "To win, all we have to do is remember the simple truths and act accordingly. Don't let anyone's behavior convince you otherwise. Don't get distracted by the noise. Don't let the market movements adjust your perception of reality, for they do not decide it. \n\n  \nAll of the known information is priced in, yes. Interpretation of that information is not. It cannot be. We as investors fundamentally disagree on how to weigh all of the data.  That interpretation is your alpha. And then there is the constant barrage of media stories moving people's perceptions. Don't be fooled by the noise. That is your alpha. \n\n**So what is true?** \n\nComputers can now read and write. Say that to yourself. Computers can read and write. If someone had told you that this would happen in 2024, would you have believed them?\n\nThe \"is AGI coming or not\" is nerd bait. A distraction. Even if the new technology plateaus here, there would be 20 years of economic gains purely because computers can now read and write. \n\nBut that is not all that has been unlocked, is it? They can also hear and speak. They can see and act. Self-driving cars are here. Waymo has them. Tesla will have them soon. \n\nI am an AI engineer. I read and re-read the original Transformers paper over and over and over again until I understood every single word. Thats how I learn. Over and over, deeper and deeper, until it all clicks. I can see with 100% confidence that the technology underpinning LLMs is completely non-specific to any specific domain. \n\n  \n**We have just begun to harness this new power**\n\n  \nInputs in. Predictions out. Past in. Future out. That's it. It can learn any and every pattern the world has. Compacting the information of the past into a machine that can predict the future. I don't know how big that opportunity is. But I know we will underestimate it. We always do. Unless you're von Neumann. \n\nThis is obviously going to create a huge bubble. You can't have this kind of transformation without people getting overexcited for a few years. But we aren't at that stage yet. Look at how long the dotcom bubble took, and more importantly, look how the late stage was characterized - explosion of IPOs. Until we get a flood of IPOs, we aren't in the late stage. Until we see an IPO for SexRobots Inc, we aren't in the late stage.  \n\n  \nAt the moment we've got a handful of companies beating expectations because of AI revenue (good for Nvidia, long-term), and some beating CapEx expectations because of AI spending (good for Nvidia, short-term)\n\n  \n**The current situation**\n\nLook at Nvidia P/E compared to its share price. We're halfway through the year. At the end of this fiscal year, Nvidia will be worth $180 at the midline of this trend. It is currently $113. That is a 57% return, 157% on an annualized basis. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i4tguqzn8yed1.png?width=2324&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0e0112355ff9ff89dac811c03202050eadf34a6\n\nNvidia is down 17% from its peak. Its hard to call the bottom, but yesterday we saw a major flash crash followed by a v back up. Much like the opposite of the \"blow-off\" tops that we see when the bull runs peak. \n\nBig volume selling, big volume buying. Big down, big up. \n\nI expect the fast bears used that to get out. The slow ones will watch their profits start eroding before also bailing and taking their gains. The slower ones will hit their stop losses, and the slowest will drift back into the red.\n\nIf you're a bear in the green, take the W and get out\n\n\n\n**Upcoming catalysts**\n\nOther company earnings next week - MSFT, META, SNAP, AMD, ARM  \n\n\n**Upcoming earnings**\n\nWhat are the market expectations for next earnings? They say they are expecting $0.59  per share. But last quarter Nvidia made that, on the back of 26B in revenue. For this quarter, Nvidia predicted 28B revenue. If they hit that, we're looking at $0.66. But of course they're being conservative. Why wouldn't they? When your growth is 262% you have plenty of room to estimate conservatively. \n\nHow conservative are they usually? Last time they predicted 24B and hit 26B. If roughly that amount extra happens again, we're looking at 30B in revenue and $0.70 in profit. \n\n  \n**My positions**\n\n$100 call 8/16 expiration (bought +20 for $32,000) \n\nDon't do what I do. Buy a longer expiration.
