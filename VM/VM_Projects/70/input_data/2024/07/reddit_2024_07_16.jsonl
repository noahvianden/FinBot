When these institutions make moves, they often sell across the board, leading to similar chart patterns among these stocks.\n\nInstitutional investors have enormous influence on the market, and their decisions can trigger massive fluctuations. When they adjust their portfolios, the impact is felt across all the stocks they hold, causing synchronized movements in the market. This phenomenon often results in NVIDIA’s stock being swept along with broader market trends, regardless of the company’s individual performance or prospects.\n\nThis institutional dominance means that NVIDIA’s stock can be subject to broader market corrections and shifts that have little to do with its own fundamentals. The herd-like behavior of ETFs and mutual funds can lead to increased volatility, making it challenging for individual investors to navigate the market.\n\nHowever, if the investor base were composed solely of those who understand and appreciate the transformative potential of AI, the market dynamics could shift dramatically. These knowledgeable investors would be less likely to panic-sell during market turbulence, creating a more stable and resilient stock. Hedge funds and short sellers would find it much harder to manipulate the market, as the shares would be held by confident investors committed to the long-term vision.\n\nThis stability typically emerges when inexperienced investors are priced out, leaving only those who recognize the true value of the company. When the market is dominated by informed investors, the focus shifts from short-term gains to long-term growth, fostering a healthier investment environment.\n\nIn conclusion, while institutional holdings in ETFs contribute to the synchronized volatility of NVIDIA’s stock, a shift towards a more knowledgeable and steadfast investor base could mitigate these effects. By prioritizing long-term value and understanding the profound impact of AI, investors can help create a more stable and prosperous future for NVIDIA.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": ">In conclusion, while institutional holdings in ETFs contribute to the synchronized volatility of NVIDIA’s stock, a shift towards a more knowledgeable and steadfast investor base could mitigate these effects.

Coming from a different professional domain (Engineering) it is very difficult for me to appreciate the herd-like mentality that permeates throughout the investing world and the impacts it has on investment decisions and perceptions of what makes a particular company's valuation sensible. I can certainly appreciate the value of a prioritization of long-term value across the board and at face value, I would certainly want that.

That's pretty crazy.\n\nTesla's stock price is not driven by sales, yet. But if sales stay flat for too many more quarters, people are going to back out.\n\nThe reasons deliveries are flat is complex, but we can take some guesses at the delta between Trump and Biden.\n\nBiden will almost certainly continue to extend subsidies to EV's, and maybe to battery power stations as well. Solar is getting really big in CA, TX, FL and MA, NY. The first 3 are good candidates for massive battery storage.\n\nSo I suspect Tesla has a good opportunity on fundamentals under Biden, but you have to assess why deliveries are flat. It's possible Tesla doesn't know how to compete with new companies, or it's just temporal and it's still early in the EV game.\n\n  \nUnder Trump I think a lot of customers are screwed on subsidies, BUT Tesla is really the only strong brand name in EV's (specifically) so if the EV market is still healthy, then Tesla can extend their head start some more. Same problem though, you have to assess why deliveries are flat now, and why wouldn't they collapse once subsidies are gone.\n\nThe wildcard is whether Musk can spend half a billion of investors money right now, to secure billions in subsidies later on.\n\nTrump has no principles and no political mission. He just goes where the heat is, and he loves to sell things. It feels like a long shot, but it's totally possible that he'd be down to promote EVs as long as they looked cool (to him) and Musk might be able to convince him.
