This is why employees are told at each compensation review that any RSUs granted are subject to board approval.\n\nAnd this is not necessarily a bad thing for shareholders: doing this allows Amazon to attract employees with 10s or hundreds of thousands (sometimes millions) of dollars of compensation without having to come up with the cash for it.
