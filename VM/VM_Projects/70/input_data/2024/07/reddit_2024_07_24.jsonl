{"title": "When to give up?", "selftext": "Hello, I had 1600 usd and I decided to buy Nvidia when it was around $133. Then it started to go down and I sold half of it to buy Broadcom stocks. Guess what? It also started to go down at a very concerning level. I lost more than I thought I can tolerate and now it looks like I will even lose more than this as it is going down whenever I check. I'm not sure whether I should keep these stocks or sell them because most people I see on social media thinks that nvidia stocks are overpriced now and thats why I dont think it will go up to the level of $135 soon. Thats why I dont think I will make a profit of nvidia anymore. I am already around -$90 in nvidia. Should I just keep them and forget all about it for a long time or sell it as soon as possible to avoid more loss? I also bought AVGO the day when it stock splitted after I read so much about how it would go up just as nvidia did. But it only has gone down since then. I really dont have much background or history in investing, I had just thought nvidia could make me rich or something. \n\nI sincerely ask for your opinions. I am not even sure if I should just quit investing. I'm 23 and just started this but all my stocks only went down so I feel like losing hope...\n\nThanks for your replies in advance.", "id": "1eb92s8", "created_utc": 1721846518.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.5, "num_comments": 75, "comments": [{"body": "Leave it there for next two years, dont even look at it.\n\nIn the future just DCA into VOO and chill.
