It is, however, from 2019 back when Elon was a media darling and everyone thought he could do no wrong. Did you also complain about Elon back in 2019, or were you more than happy to fill your coffers with Tesla returns?\n\nElon has always been rowdy online - with his overly optimistic projections and stuff like this. He has in fact toned it down considerably. Begs the question though, why do you all hate him now? Was he not poorly representing Tesla as the CEO back then as well?\n\nI stand by what I said that he has not made demeaning remarks against anyone since the Twitter acquisition which, let's be honest, is when you all collectively agreed to hate on him. Will happily change my opinion if proven wrong.", "score": -5, "replies": [{"body": ">when you all collectively agreed to hate on him. Will happily change my opinion if proven wrong.\n\nInteresting you seem to know what a whole collective group of people thinks and especially that I belong to that collective. \n\nMy dislike of Elon actually started even before the pedoguy thing. And he didn't just call him a pedo, he actually hired a PI  to try and prove it. Pathetic behaviour really \nThat moment definitely cemented my opinion of him. And 2019 is only 5 years ago. Not ages. 5 years. \n\nAnd yes, his antics fully put me off ever buying a tesla as long as he's calling the shots and profiting of the sale. It's actually the main reason I'd never buy one. It's called having principles. Also I've never profited from Tesla's succes. See my previous point. \n\nBut since you're moving the goalposts this conversation is useless. You wanted an example of Elon making demeaning remarks online, you got one. Now it needs to be more recent. How about when he got in that spat on twitter with an ex employee? Claiming he did no work because he was disabled? That's fucked up. And then backtracking when he found out he fucked up big time and it was going to cost him moneys? That's the behaviour of an impulse skinless weasel if I've ever seen it. But you'll probably just move the goalpost again. Maybe Elon will buy you a horse someday after you've given him head since you already have his balls in your mouth apparently, you'll get there!\n\nYou can like Elon, I don't really give a shit. But at least be honest about him. He's an asshole. Even his kids seem to think so, that's telling. How many nice dudes do you know that have kids that don't want anything to do with him?  \n\nHe throws fits when someone knows something better than him, which is more often than you would like to believe. It's a notable pattern in bis behaviour. His skin is wafer thin.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "If you are one of the few who disliked Musk before the twitter debacle, then all the power to you. This post was not meant for you. \n\nHowever, I do question why you are on this subreddit if you hate Musk so vehemently and refuse to buy a Tesla. Why are you invested in the company? If you're not, I have nothing to say to you. Find something better to do with your life than creeping and sh\\*tposting on a sub of a company you hate.\n\nAs for the 2019 case, no he did not hire a PI to prove that the guy was a pedophile. We don't know why he hired the PI, so don't presume. Elon clarified that he did not accuse him of being a pedophile. It was a mindless online insult. And Musk won that defamation case too. So get over it. That being said, I agree that was vile and I don't believe it was appropriate behavior at all.\n\nWhen it comes to moving the goalpost, you misunderstood my intentions for this post. You're blind if you cannot see the huge shift in narrative about Musk since the Twitter deal, and that is what I'm trying to highlight. You never liked Musk? Good, you're not a hypocrite. That is not what the rest of Reddit is like though. People started hating the dude because of the twitter deal and because Elon went public with his politics. That's a fact. Nobody cared about Elon being a prick until then.\n\nMusk f-cked up and publicly apologized to the ex-Twitter employee. That is not the behavior of a \"skinless weasel\". He could've paid that dude behind the scenes and kept quiet. That's how the world works. You say it yourself, the guy is an asshole with a massive ego. A public apology to him is way more pricy than money.\n\nAnd I don't care what kind of guy he is in real. I care about what kind of CEO he is and what he is doing publicly. I did not know about the \"pedo guy\" remark and that's fair enough. That still doesn't explain why everyone here loved the guy in 2020 and hate him so much since 2022. \n\nGet f-ked with that BS horses remark though.
