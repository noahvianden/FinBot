Before you go further, it's important to get the following concept right, since it is the foundation of everything else, including the greeks.\n\n**Price is determined by the market. The greeks come after.** The greeks are observations, not drivers. They are *descriptive*, not *prescriptive*.\n\nAn analogy I like to use is that premium price is like the speed of your car as you are driving from your start time at point A to your end time at destination B. Sometimes the speed goes up, sometimes it goes down. Then the greeks are various rates of change that inform you about how your car is performing. You can think of delta like your speedometer. It might read 60 mph right now. But that doesn't mean that in exactly 1 hour you will be exactly 60 miles away. How could it do that when, in the near future, you might speed up to pass or slow down to take a curve or due to traffic? **In other words, your speedometer is not predictive.** It just tells you what your speed is at that moment in time. It is an *observation* of your speed. Similarly, delta is an *observation* of the rate of change in premium as the underlying stock price changes.\n\n> Once opened, isn't my concern more focused on intrinsic value? \n\nNot really. Only in part, because intrinsic value is part of overall premium only when the contract is ITM. What about all the OTM contracts that stay OTM? If you start with an OTM call that is worth $10 and you end with the same OTM call that is worth $11 (or $9), there is no intrinsic value in play, because the call is still OTM.\n\nWhile it's important to understand the contribution of intrinsic value to total premium, it's not the primary concern. **The primary concern is the total premium vs. time vs. your forecast for where that premium is going in the near future.** And a major player in that forecast is volatility.\n\nSo here's the second options concept to burn into your brain:\n\n**Every option trade is an opinion about volatility.**\n\nThat includes the past, present, and future evolution of volatilty. I won't go further into vol in this reply since it's already going long, but just prepare yourself to spend a lot of time studying and learning about volatility.\n\nHere's the illustrative example you asked for. You buy to open (long) a call on XYZ with the 100 strike expiring 9/20 (next monthly expiration) for $2.00. The current price of XYZ is $90 at the time of open, so your call is OTM. That means 100% of the premium of the call ($2) is time value. There is no intrinsic value. \n\nA week later, the stock price has risen to $95, so your call is still OTM. The premium on the call is now $2.40, still 100% time value, no intrinsic. You have a 20% gain on the premium. You can sell to close to collect $.40/share in profit.\n\nNotice that the illustration made no reference to the greeks at all. They don't dictate price nor the gain/loss on the trade. You might note the observations they make along the way, for example, the delta on the call most likely increased along with the underlying price, but that fact doesn't change how you make a profit on the trade.\n\nAlso notice that I could remove the fact that the XYZ stock rose to $95 and the illustration still is complete. Stock price isn't all that relevant to the total gain/loss on the trade. It's entirely possible for XYZ to have stayed the same price, or even gone down a little, for you still to have a profit on the trade.

There is no such thing as a \"sell put\" or \"buy put.\" Standard terms would be short put and long put, respectively. Or you can use STO (Sell To Open) put and BTO (Buy To Open) put.\n\n> is it possible that I get exercised and need to pay x much amount of money?\n\nSort of, but you used the wrong example. The only time this is something to worry about is on the call wing, or call credit spreads in general. If you have a 500/505c call wing, AND you hold through expiration, AND the expiration price is say 502, your 505 long call expires worthless, so you lose your insurance against assignment, and the 500 short call is assigned. You will RECEIVE (not spend) $50,000 in cash, but you will also be short 100 shares of SPY and that will consume a lot of buying power. If SPY shares then go up, you are exposed to unlimited risk of loss. That's the worst-case scenario.\n\nIf it's the put spread, like 495/490p, AND you hold though expiration, AND the expiration price is let's say 492, the 490 long put expires worthless, so you lose your insurance against assignment, and the 495 short put is assigned. You will have to pay $49,500 in cash, but you will receive 100 shares as well, so at least you get something of value for the assignment. If SPY goes down, that could be a problem, and of course, if you don't have $49,500 in the first place, your broker will do a risk management intervention and buy to close the short put before expiration, possibly at a large loss to you.\n\n**The best way to avoid these problems is don't hold ICs (or any options) through expiration day**. Close the entire trade, the whole IC, before expiration day, and you can forget about all these worst-case scenarios.\n\n> I am thinking about buying back the sold right as it becomes in the money to prevent it but could someone exercise it before I even get a chance to buy it back?\n\nNo, but don't do that. It's better to just close the whole IC and get full value for the profitable wing. The only short-cut you should consider taking is close the tested wing.
