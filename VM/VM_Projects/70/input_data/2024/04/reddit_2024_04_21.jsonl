{"title": "Why Elon deserves the $50B pay package and why this whole situation is ridiculous.", "selftext": "Imagine this:\n\nMeta hires you as a product manager for a new project. You lead this project ground up; you hire everyone you need, come up with the product, work on the design, engineering, production, and anything and everything else involved with a zero-to-market project.\n\nLet’s say you’re REALLY confident in your capability to make this happen. You create an EXTREMELY ambitious timeline of financial and operational objectives that’s undeniably and unbelievably generous in favor of the shareholders, Meta in this case.\n\nThe actual plan is that you will basically 13x Meta’s investment over 10 years and you get paid nothing if you don’t. Your \"vesting period\" is 1% every $50B of investment appreciation, meaning you get paid 1% of $50B for every $50B increase in the value of the investment. Meta gives you a starting budget of $50B and you would, according to your plan, 13x this to $650B and get paid 1% of $50B, every $50B. Keep in mind that getting nothing by not meeting the goals is meant to be taken literally; the plan is a 100% at-risk performance award, meaning you receive absolutely nothing, $0, if you don’t reach each of these milestones in the specified timeframe.\n\nThis is an extremely favorable deal for Meta, isn’t it? Obviously, they accept this proposition.\n\nYou tackle the project and are so good at what you do, that you hit the 13x goal in 5 years. This equates to growing Meta's $50B investment to the $650B goal in 5 years, and you are to be paid $6.5B (1% of $50B = $500M, $500M \\* 13 = $6.5B).\n\n(To all that say \"$6.5B isn't $50B\", in Elon's case the $6.5B represents stock options that are now worth $50B AFTER he grew the company to it's current size. Realistically, it was probably only worth $2-4B whenever this compensation plan was implemented.)\n\nJust like after your first project that you grew from $3B to $50B, you go to Zuck’s office to collect your paycheck (that you aren’t allowed to cash in for another 5 years to prove your commitment to the project and company). Right as you get to his door, a level 1 customer support employee making minimum wage walks in and says “hey, I don’t think $6.5B is fair.” Zuck then turns to you and says \"Hey, I know you took on this job for zero upfront pay and pay based only on performance, which you exceeded expectations on, but this guy who understands nothing about what you achieved said that's unfair so I'm gonna have to revoke your pre-agreed upon pay package and pay you $0.\"\n\nNow, replace Meta with us (the shareholders) and you with Elon. This is, in essence, what Elon is experiencing right now. If you were in this situation, would you think that's fair? And I'm sure to Elon, it's not even all about the money; if he were financially motivated, he wouldn't have risked 100% of his net worth on saving Tesla and SpaceX years ago and would've just retired off of his PayPal earnings.\n\nIt's the injustice that is taking on near-impossible milestones that exists only for the betterment of Tesla shareholders and human civilization, hitting those milestones, and then being denied of the proper, deserved recognition by the very people he benefitted.\n\nIt's the pure absurdity that is someone like Kathaleen McCormick, who is unafraid to show and rule based on her personal biases over facts, being allowed to hold so much power.\n\nLet's do our part to try to make this right.
