{"title": "Where NVDA Trades in May Pt. 2", "selftext": "This post is a continuation and update to the first part of this series published here \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/NVDA_Stock/comments/1cc50d6/where_nvda_trades_in_may/\n\nQuick rehash.  The NASDAQ-100 (QQQ) peaked at $449.50 a few weeks ago and had a significant 8% sell-off to $413 a share last Friday.  NVDA fell to a low of around $750 after forming a double-top breakdown at $840 a share.  But everything (market & NVDA) was massively oversold and due to bounce this week.  And they have.  \n\nWith the exception of META’s earnings leading to a gap down, the market has moved higher nearly every hour of every day of this week.  Even on the META lead gap-down yesterday, the market immediately bottomed at the open and was bought all day long.  From the open to the close, nearly every single hour was green. \n\nThe NASDAQ-100 has retraced 50% of its losses and I think there’s still a little more upside ahead.  I STILL expect the QQQ to peak somewhere around $436-$437 as I mentioned in part 1.  \n\nThat being said, there is a chance we have a higher retracement and the QQQ can push into the $440’s.  That’s a high retracement bounce.  They are rare, but they have happened.  In fact, as I mentioned in part 1, it happened TWICE in the last (most recent) QQQ correction (July - Nov 2023).  \n\nBut after that — whether at $436 or $442 — the QQQ will see another big leg lower.  Chances are we make new lows on that leg as the QQQ still hasn’t had a 10% correction.  You can see why that is likely to happen in post 1 above.  \n\nTl;dr I expect the QQQ to top out somewhere in the mid $430’s to low $440’s with another big leg down after that to a low of around $400.  \n\n——————\nNVDA UPDATE \n\nNVDA has done some very significant things this week and made some major headway.  I did expect NVDA to test $840.  I didn’t expect it to break $840.  A breakout above $840 changes things for NVDA.  Now it’s not enough that NVDA merely breaks above $840.  It needs to close well above $840 today to be consider a real breakout.  \n\nIf it does close up here in the $860’s or higher, then it’s very probable that the $750 lows we saw last Friday are THE LOWS.  NVDA will see another leg down with the QQQ for sure.  But it’s unlikely to see levels below last Fridays $750 lows.   In fact, it’s going to take a lot of selling to even get it below $800.  \n\nHere’s why.  Nvidia tested $840 this week, failed to break above and then fell to $800.  A lot of other stocks would have ended right then and there.  Normally you’d see a breakdown below $800 with a stock on its way to new lows. \n\nWhat we saw instead was NVDA hold its $800 support which then brought in a lot of FOMO buyers and momentum traders.  \n\nFurthermore, NVDA has retraced more of its losses on a relative basis than has the NASDAQ-100 or S&P 500.  It's tracking ahead on retracement levels.  \n\nThat all points to NVDA lows being in.  It will largely depend on the level of selling that comes in with the QQQ's next leg lower which will start sometime in 5-7 days (5-10 days at most).  \n\n—————-\n\nWhat’s next for NVDA? \nThe next obvious level the bulls are going to want to take is the $900 level.  That’s the level NVDA struggled with ahead of the sell-off.  That’s where you’re most likely to see some resistance.  \n\nIf NVDA does take $900 resistance convincingly, then the momentum will shore up the stock and keep it from falling very far in the second leg lower in the market.  It probably holds above $840 in that case and is setting up to take $1000 after earnings.  \n\nOf course this all depends on how NVDA closes today.  If $840 resistance is convincingly taken today, then $900 is the next level it’s probably pushing to.\n\nNow of course this all depends on the QQQ continuing its bounce up to $436-437.  \n\nWith the QQQ having retraced 50% of its losses already, it can peak at any moment.  It doesn’t have to run to $436-$437.  It can easily peak today.  That would be a 5-day rebound which is typical.  5-7 days for a rebound in a correction is what we normally get.\n\nThe point here is this.  Whether NVDA is able to fight $900 is going to depend on how much longer the QQQ bounce goes for.  AT MOST, through next week.  The QQQ likely peaks between now and next Friday.  \n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS \n\n1.  NVDA $750 lows likely hold on the second leg down in the market.    That’s the big change in outlook.  No longer think we see low $700’s.   Moderately confident right now.  Highly confident if NVDA sees $900 next week.  \n\n2.  NVDA $840 resistance is key.  NVDA needs to close well above $840 today to convince traders over the weekend that $840 resistance is taken.  \n\n3.  NVDA $900 resistance will depend on QQQ peak.  If the QQQ peaks early next week, may not get a shot.  If NVDA does take out $900, it probably means it takes $1000 after earnings regardless of what the NASDAQ-100 does next. \n\n4.  The QQQ has retraced 50% of its losses at $431 and I expected to see it peak somewhere near $436-$437.  Moderately confident in that forecast. Highly confident in the low $440’s.  Meaning if the QQQ goes to as high as the low $440’s next week, I’m highly confident we see a peak there.\n\n———-\n\nUpdate (1:10 pm est on 4/26)\n\nAs I was writing this, NVDA pushed up to $875 which is very significant.  NVDA fell $119.86 last week and is up $115 right now on the week.  If it moves up another $5, it will mean that NVDA will have retraced ALL of last week’s losses.  That’s very bullish.  It’s also exactly why the $750 lows are good.  Won’t be taken on the next leg lower.  \n\nNormally what you should see is maybe half of the week’s losses retraced.  Or maybe even 70%.  But to retrace all the losses.  It means there’s tremendous support and a lot of money on the sidelines wanting to come in.  \n\nRemember that double top breakdown is overs. It happened. We hit $970 twice, fell below $840 support dropping $90 after that.  It’s now all reset essentially.  The only thing hanging over NVDA right now is resistance levels and the QQQ next leg lower.  \n\n—————\n\nUpdate (12:20 EST on 5/1/2024)\nNothing at all has changed since I posted parts 1 & 2.  If you read what is posted and the directional outlook, the market has followed it to the letter.  The QQQ did peak at the 50% retracement after-all.  NVDA went too far in its bounce to make new lows as I explained last Friday.  As I also outlined last Friday, NVDA would have another big leg downs. Here’s that leg down.  It’s why I exited my NVDA calls.  \n\nBecause NVDA rebounded all the way past its $840 resistance and up into the $880’s, it probably holds its $750 lows.  In fact, what we’re probably seeing here right now is a higher low to bottom the stock and then it will rally up through $1000 after earnings.  \n\nAs for the NASDAQ-100, it actually reached oversold conditions today on the hourly time frame.  Not extreme.  But oversold.  So there’s a real risk for a big rebound any moment now.  I’ve unloaded a lot of my puts today on the QQQ and I’m now 65% cash and 35% short.  \n\n—————-\n\nUpdate (3:06pm EST on May 1) \nFed statement released.   The headline is Powell saying it is unlikely the fed will raise rates this year despite weaker inflation data for the entire quarter.  The fed is now mostly in a higher for longer mindset.  I think the market was a bit concerned of a full reversal in fed policy.  \n\nThis is all expressed in the technicals.  That’s what most non-professional traders don’t ever seem to grasp.  You can forecast broad market direction without ever looking at the news because the news is mostly built into the chart.  \n\nI’d even be willing to wager that most professional traders can forecast market direction locked in a room without access to any news whatsoever. \n\nTake today for example.  As I mentioned at 12:30 — hours before the fed — the market was oversold.   Not extremely oversold.  But oversold.  I reduced my shorts from 75% to 30%.  That’s a drastic reduction.  \n\nNow back mostly into cash and waiting to reshort later.  Why reshort.  Because today session tells us that we’re still on the FIRST rebounded that all started last Monday.  We’re still on the same move higher.  It hasn’t ended.  \n\nHad we closed at the lows today, that would be a different story.   \n\nWhat we’re seeing right now is a correction that looks very very similar to July - November 2023.  Back then, the first rebound lasted 11 sessions with volatile swings back and forth.  The next leg took almost 18 sessions to complete.  That an entire month.  \n\nRight now, we’re 8 sessions into the rebound and the chart looks very very similar to the July top.  \n\nBack then we had three legs down with two major rebounds in-between.  I expect we’ll see something similar here.  \n\nThis will be a longer correction in terms of duration.  Why do we expect things to continue lower in the intermediate term after a rebound?  Because we still haven’t seen a 10% correction.  It’s possible it’s avoided here.  But the overwhelming number of cases we’ve seen historically (particularly when the QQQ rises 25%+) is for a 10% correction.  You only have 1 cases where it didn’t happen (Nov 2010).  \n\nSo that’s where we are.  I’ll begin putting my shorts back on once the QQQ reaches a 70-RSI on the hourly.   \n\nI believe NVDA is in the same boat as the broader market right now.  The two chart looks identical.  They’re moving in lockstep right now.  NVDA simply had a higher beta.

I have to say your predictions are all over the map and remain contradictory. The last post was based on levels on NVDA QQQ and Nas100, and missed some important non TA inputs. Mega Cap earnings kicked off this week and were overall bullish by analysts going into them. AI spend on infrastructure is going up and some revenue is being seen by MSFT. It isn't that  \"NVDA has done some very significant things this week\" it is that other companies have reported buying new chips not all specifying NVDA but that is inferred considering NVDA is the most completive chip. This exact same scenario happen early this year during earnings.  The geopolitical events and Fed rate pivots has more to do with a market wide selloff than NVDA retracing. Of course there were support levels at 820, 800 and in the mid 700's but getting into the 700's was more about a market wide correction than NVDA. The fundamentals are too strong  for NVDA to go much lower than 800  at this time going into earnings.

So make your own call end of the day.", "score": 7, "replies": []}, {"body": "So I’ll try to be very succinct here as there’s a lot to unpack.  Corrections are rarely due to fundamentals.  Sometimes fundamentals drive corrections.  But in most cases, markets corrects after certain periods of moving higher.  It’s on a cycle.  There’s no greater evidence than that than the table I posted in part 1.  Go look at it closely. Notice how similar every rally really is.  Both in terms of duration and percentage gain.  \n\nThe market just moves up in segments.  And corrections all seem to take the same exact path both in time and in percentages.  \n\nThe BROAD direction (bull/bear markets) are determined by fundamentals.  \n\nThere’s nothing contradictory in what I’m writing.  The QQQ rallied from $341 up to $449 and fell 8% on its first leg down bottoming at $413.  I went long.  I forecasted a rebound up to at least 50% retracement which is $431.  We’re at $432 right now.  \n\nI expect another leg down.  Where will the peak be?  As I mention in the post, $431 (50%) retracement is a good candidate but it’s far less predictable than forecasting a bounce from oversold conditions.  That’s far easier to forecasted than precisely picking a top.  But $431 is good, $436/$437 has big resistance and $441/$442 has very heavy resistance.  All good candidates for a peak. \n\nAfter that, $400 is the likely lows.  \n\nWhat so far is contradictory in any in this?  \n\nApply to NVDA.  NVDA’s fundamental are KNOWN.  There’s only so many times one can say, Ai spending is robust.  The installed base is doubling to $2T.  Market knows all of this.  There’s nothing truly surprise in any of the news this week.  Let’s put it this ways. Nothing in the news this week truly alters NVDA’s fundamental.  Nothing at all.  NVDA is trading on an assumed $70B in future net income. \n\nFurthermore; the market largely disregards fundamental during market corrections. That’s why all stocks go down together.  Good stocks.  Bad stocks.  It doesn’t matters. They’re all subject to risk deleveraging.  When risk comes off; all stocks go down.  \n\nOkay.  So let’s apply to NVDA.  NVDA fell from a peak at $970 to a low of $750.  About $220 right? \n\nQqq fell from $449.50 to a low of $413.  That’s $36.50.  \n\nThe 50% retracement for the QQQ is $431.25 let’s call it’s. Right around there.  \n\nThe 50% retracement for Nvidia is $860.  But there’s also heavy resistance at $840 you must account for + the beta + earnings. \n\nSo all these things figure into the forecast for NVDA on the QQQ rebounds. \n\nPersonally I thought $840 would hard for NVDA to take.  But was I highly confident it would peak there?  Nope.  I was more confident in it reaching $840 this week than I was that I was that it would top at $840.  Hence why I said the markets have varying levels of predictability.  The rebound was very predictable, how high isn’t as predictable. \n\nThat being said, NVDA is only just barely tracking ahead of the QQQ.  The QQQ retraced 50%.  Nvidia has retraced 60%.  \n\nSo not really sure what you mean when you say contradictory.  Help me understand that.  \n\nIf you mean that I changed my mind about where the ultimate lows are for NVDA.  Then sure.  I’m going to change my mind if the market does otherwise \n\nIf the QQQ rallies back to $449, I’m going to change my entire outlook. Do think that is likely the QQQ gets back to $449. No.  Would I change my outlook if it did? For sure I would.  \n\nOnly an idiot wouldn’t change with the market conditions changing.  The QQQ has bottomed at less than a 10% correction before.  It is rare.  On the table I posted, we’ve only seen the one case going back to 2010.  But it has happened and it could happen here.", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "I will give you credit.

Nothing wrong on revamping your analysis. I think you were a bit premature in your price targets this week  and didn't take tech earrings into account. PCE outlook is posted on the Cleveland Fed page and was looking in line for a while. After a glimpse into your other posts and I say this with much appreciation because I generally find your insight thought provoking, I do see some contradictory numbers thrown out over the last few weeks. I would need to take some time to pull those quotes but there was some 1000 calls early on that turned to 700 calls in the short term and there was a summer number of 1000 revised to the  700's.  Difficult to gauge where you stand sometimes. You are also saying it is hard to call a top which I agree but not impossible to see. RSI at 84 for extended periods is not sustainable, and a RSI at 20 is pretty easy to call a bounce.

Currently the QQQ 1D RSI is at 49 with a lot of room to go up. NVDA 1D RSI is at 54 also with a lot of room to go up. The resistance levels you have thrown out are correct. However the macro picture is missing and is why you are missing these calls in the direction. If you take a look at the earnings for Mega Cap Tech earlier this year you get a picture of how that infused news into the NVDA narrative which brought the stock higher. This is also happening now. AI CAPEX spend is being reported in earnings. Some companies like TSLA reporting purchases of NVDA GPU's some inferring more spend on GPU's. The best most competitive GPU is the BW which was delivered to Open AI this week and is most likely the GPU to be purchased in the next wave of Tech CAPEX. Now that is in the cycle NVDA earning will be highly anticipated and should rally into May. Likely a dip somewhere in there but there is room to go and test resistance levels in place  before the last correction. 900 is in reach and from there back to 960. NVDA was in a trading range of 850 to 960 for a while before the selloff. This will lkely be the range again if it doesn't push past 960. If it does 1000 is in sight for earnings and a likely split is also another possible momentum narrative for NVDA. Funds need to stay competitive and they will buy NVDA up until a point.

Intraday doesn’t really count for much.  \n\nSo how today closes really tells us how to look at this.  I can tell you this.  This morning when the QQQ was at a 30-RSi at $422, I didnt have a lot of confidence that we’d see the lows on this pullback that started yesterday.  Why?  Because oversold always leads to a bounce.  And we were never going to get back down to $414 without first rebounding.  \n\nSo the question is whether the pullback that started yesterday was the beginning of the second leg down — which will be significant— or just a small pullback within the overall rally.  \n\nWe have some hints that today is just some volatility but they were still technically in the rebound that began last Monday.  \n\nEven now as the market gives up the gains, we’re still unlikely to be able to make significant new lows because the oversold conditions point to a high low point.  \n\nThat being said, because the QQQ rallied all the way till $430 today, we’ve now alleviated some of those oversold conditions. But it’s still present.  \n\nLike if the QQQ slides back down to $413, we’ll be right back at the same extremes we were in before this rebound began.  \n\nBasically the moves down need to be more measured with some rebounding in between.  We’re not seeing much of that right now.  it’s been all one direction or the other.  \n\nWe’re at a 41.09 RSI on the hourly at $422 right now.  We were at 30.07 earlier today at the same level.

Whether it lands on that by stock split is impossible to forecast.  \n\nBut I do strongly believe it’s on a direct path to $1200 or $120 post split.  For a large number of reasons.  \n\nFirst, $120 is key psychological resistance that we often see on breakout above a key number like $100 share.  Not just for stocks, but for the market as well.  That’s why the SPY made a run to $520 the minute it broke out above $500.  \n\nSecond, Nvidia surpassed Apple in market cap at around  the $120 level.  You can bet momentum traders see that and will look to capitalize on the quick easy trade.  \n\nThird, the momentum js very strong either now and the entire market is in an overshoot process.  We just broke a few records not seen since 2015.  The Nasdaq-100 became more overbought on the hourly than at any point going back to 2015.  That’s pre-trump presidency which saw a massive rally in the market.  \n\nThat momentum carries through to NVDA.  \n\nLonger term, I think NVDA is now in for the long and hard battle to $150-$200.  It’s now getting valuation rich.  \n\nNot quite overvalued but getting there.  The $1,000 price target is based on Nvidia reaching $100 billion in net income.  That’s priced into the $1000 valuation.  \n\nThink about why.  It’s at a $2.6 trillion market cap which calls for $100 billion in net income on regular growth metrics.  Meaning the expectation is for Nvidia to produce $100B + regular 10-20% annual growth for a 25-30 P/E ratio.  \n\nThis is why Apple, Microsoft and others topped out right around that $3T valuation.  Apple hasn’t gone anywhere in nearly 3-years now.  Apple was trading at $180 a share in December 2021! It closed at $189 on Friday.  Its highs are $200.  So in three years it managed to make 10% new highs from the peak in 2021 to the peak this year.  And right now it’s only trading a mere 5% higher than it was back then.  \n\nYou’re going to see the same stall out for Nvidia.  Because all of its future expected growth is already priced into its $2.7 trillion valuation and is based on growth moderating to 20% a year.  \n\nIt will take a shot at $200 but over the coming years.  If it happens any faster than that, it will be a bubble.  It’s the only thing that can cause it to run to $200 prematurely.  \n\nBut yeah we’ve seen this play out before and I’d guess it’s making a run to $120 ($1200) before peaking and sustaining another major correction.
