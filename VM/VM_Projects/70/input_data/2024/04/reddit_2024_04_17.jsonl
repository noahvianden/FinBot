META generally rained on everyone’s parade; but honestly I would’ve expected a bigger drop considering META lost $200B in market cap. Which is extremely regarded for a beat no matter how you slice it. I almost feel like Wall St knows it was a bullshit overreact and it will bounce in the AM. As of writing this SPY is down like $3. I would’ve expected more for that much loss. We’ll see.\n\nAdd in a GDP report at 7:30am. Things could get interesting if it’s positive. The market might leave META behind to die lol. I really want Ford to leave the market behind to die. I think it deserves at least $14 tomorrow.\n\nFor Ford I’ve seen a couple FUD articles hyper-fixated on Ford’s losses building EV’s. I personally think it’s absolute garbage FUD compared to what was said on the earnings call. Ford addressed this head on stating they are still figuring out manufacturing costs for EV’s and they’ve already implemented a plan to shave off $2B in costs in the next year, which should then turn a profit on EV’s. The argument here being, Ford is fairly new to EV’s. Everyone’s golden child Tesla took YEARS before EV profitability.\n\nLast, Ford Pro is a money printer. Even the analysts were floored by the Ford Pro numbers. One of the analysts on the call (I think from JP Morgan?) claimed he ran projections and Ford Pro at its current growth rate will surpass the rest of the business. Ford literally has a company within a company that’s likely going to eclipse the original company 😂\n\nFor options expiring Friday or next week I’m hoping the analysts get their reports done sooner vs later.

Their Ford Pro offering is absolutely crushing. One of the analysts (I think from JP Morgan) did an analysis and the potential for the Ford Pro division is enough to literally replace the Revenue for the entire company. Kind of a bonkers thought. More info on Ford Pro below:\n\nhttps://www.fordpro.com/en-us/intelligence/fleet-management?searchid=15133968459%7C129330975076%7C294895195573%7C&ef_id=CjwKCAjw26KxBhBDEiwAu6KXt1AC-NdUPVh5SJFKsxc3x28aLsy3GMRDaGc7pORG1pLF8T1yeTrxZBoCDxQQAvD_BwE:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!2519!3!672006352680!e!!g!!ford%20pro!15133968459!129330975076&gclsrc=aw.ds&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjw26KxBhBDEiwAu6KXt1AC-NdUPVh5SJFKsxc3x28aLsy3GMRDaGc7pORG1pLF8T1yeTrxZBoCDxQQAvD_BwE\n\nThey also have tons of cash on hand to put towards growth. The increase in spending and decrease in cash flow this quarter was mostly due to them investing in the Pro business.\n\nThe focus for the EV business is to reduce costs and they’re projecting $2B in savings on EV production in 2024. \n\nMy take is we’re going to see analysts update price targets higher after this. If you’re a shareholder that’s good news. Ford shares are basically a money printer on a long hold. Wondering if this earnings might attract more institutional buys. I still like $15 in the short term.
