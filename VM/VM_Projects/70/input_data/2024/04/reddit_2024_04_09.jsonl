{"title": "Google unveils custom Arm-based chips ", "selftext": "Google is trying to make cloud computing more affordable with a custom-built Arm-based server chip. At its Cloud Next conference in Las Vegas on Tuesday, the company said the new processor will become available later in 2024.\n\nWith the new Arm-based chip, Google is playing catch-up with rivals such as Amazon and Microsoft, which have been employing a similar strategy for years. The tech giants compete fiercely in the growing market for cloud infrastructure, where organizations rent out resources in faraway data centers and pay based on usage.\n\nGoogle parent Alphabet still derives three-quarters of revenue from advertising, but cloud is growing faster and now represents almost 11% of company revenue. The segment, which contains corporate productivity applications, is also profitable. Google held 7.5% of the cloud infrastructure market in 2022, while Amazon and Microsoft together controlled around 62%, according to Gartner estimates.\n\nMarket leader Amazon Web Services introduced its Graviton Arm chip in 2018. “Almost all their services are already ported and optimized on the Arm ecosystem,” Chirag Dekate, an analyst at technology industry researcher Gartner, told CNBC in an interview. Graviton has picked up business from Datadog, Elastic, Snowflake and Sprinklr, among others.\n\nAlibaba announced Arm processors in 2021, and Microsoft did the same in November.\n\nArm isn’t completely new to Google, which started selling access to virtual machines, or VMs, that use Oracle-backed startup Ampere’s Arm-based chips earlier this year.\n\nPorting applications to Arm machines has made sense for organizations seeking to reduce spending on cloud computing because of economic worries. When Arm Holdings filed to go public last year, it pointed to Amazon’s claim that Graviton could give up to 40% better price performance than comparable server instances, such as the common “x86” model used by AMD and Intel processors.\n\nGoogle has used Arm-based server computers for internal purposes to run YouTube advertising, the BigTable and Spanner databases, and the BigQuery data analytics tool. The company will gradually move them over to the cloud-based Arm instances, which are named Axion, when they become available, a spokesperson said.\n\nDatadog and Elastic plan to adopt Axion, along with OpenX and Snap, the spokesperson said.\n\nBroader use of chips drawing on Arm’s architecture might lead to lower carbon emissions for certain workloads. Virtual slices of physical servers containing the Axion chips deliver 60% more energy efficiency than comparable VMs based on the x86 model, Google cloud chief Thomas Kurian wrote in a blog post. Arm chips, which are popular in smartphones, offer a shorter set of instructions than x86 chips, which are commonly found in PCs.\n\nThe chips can also speed up applications.\n\nAxion offers 30% better performance than the fastest general-purpose Arm-based virtual machines in the cloud and 50% better performance than comparable VMs based on x86, Google said.\n\n“I think it completes their portfolio,” Dekate said.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/09/google-announces-axion-arm-based-chips-for-energy-efficient-computing.html", "id": "1bzyx8m", "created_utc": 1712686226.0, "score": 270, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 81, "comments": [{"body": "Love me some $GOOG", "score": 47, "replies": [{"body": "Reddit was telling me it was a failed company on the downfall and I'm up almost 16% since March 1st.\n\nThe reaction to Gemini was overkill considering it doesn't even make google any significant amount of money at the moment.", "score": 41, "replies": [{"body": "Reddit hate it = it’s good \nThat’s why I bought more during the last selloff at $133", "score": 13, "replies": []}, {"body": "Reddit either tells you that it is a failed company about to go bankrupt or that they are too successful and a monopoly and need to be broken up.\n\nThe reality is that there just never been a company like Google.

Logic would suggest those with high end cars, especially with access to their own charging, would be less close to high density urban centers. Charging and in/out parking have been very limited in every city I’ve lived, and demand for taxi/Ubers was pretty low in the suburbs. If this were the case in general, you’d have a higher concentration of robotaxi capable vehicles further away from where they’re more likely to be needed. \n\nThe personal economics of it don’t make a ton of sense either— as the robotaxi capability would be a type of secondary revenue stream. If you can afford a Tesla and have dedicated access to a charger, you probably have your own garage as well as owning a decently costly vehicle, insurance, etc., does this demographic also need what probably amounts to minimal net revenue at the expense of increased depreciation and the remnants of strangers smoking, puking, and boning in their car? \n\nAnd yes, there are always reported incidents of Uber drivers and cabbies and bus drivers assaulting passengers and otherwise misbehaving, but what niche is the robotaxi seeking to fill? To me, a person driving a Lyft or Uber isn’t the unreasonable part of the experience— it’s usually neutral and sometimes beneficial. I fail to see how Tesla and the car owners will get their cut from the robotaxi in a manner that isn’t the same or greater costs than current models. And a driver can know local things like “the entrance around the corner is safer than the building address you gave, I’ll drop you there instead” or where to eat, avoid, etc. Or crucially, you can tell a cabbie in midtown Manhattan rush hour ‘there’s a $100 bonus tip if you get me to JFK in 70’ and you’ll find out how fast you can get across the city and have a realistic shot of making it. \n\nI just genuinely don’t understand who would benefit from widespread implementation of this idea.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Definitely. Especially with all the talk of “a Tesla is an investment.” The costs of depreciation from increased use plus insurance, minus taxes and repairs would probably favor not using it as a taxi. Especially when you consider even a marginally increased risk of having your now depreciated robotaxi totaled by another car while it was making a cross town run to earn you $12 in robofare before taxes— you’ll never be made whole unless you’re already paying higher rates for some type of full replacement value insurance, thereby digging one more hole to try to fill the other. \n\nA two big premises of the fundamental concept of the taxi is that it’s a fairly standardized, primarily functional, highly durable, powerful, comparatively low tech machine that can be rebuilt with $50 worth of things at a 7/11, and run smooth at 250k miles. And even for the cabbie who loves his cab the most, it’s ultimately a tool for the job, and not a luxury item for personal enjoyment or a financial investment for resale. If an average driver used their car as a robotaxi as much as they used it themselves, that would end up being around 25k total miles per year, or the difference in hitting 100k miles in 4 years vs 8. That difference is massive for your personal vehicle.\n\nEdit: you also don’t have to travel terribly far off the beaten path to find that addresses as consistent or predictable street numbers are a fairly western and modern concept, and I’ve been to cities that don’t have addresses and they use landmarks or building names / identifiers for visitors, whereas locals would just say something like “take me to the theatre near the western market square.” So in some not insignificant places, you’d literally have to invent an address grid.

You will only need to build a few million cars a year with such a model, which means that between building a factory in Mexico and India you will have more than enough factories to make these cars.\n\nFor countries less well-off, high quality and safe robotaxis are a no-brainer as it means a massive improvement in economic efficiency. It also helps solves the infrastructure issues with charging (build charging hubs as opposed to independent chargers all over the place). In fact, I suspect Tesla may possibly roll out wireless charging (if they can cut the power losses) to make it easy for robotaxis to charge.\n\nOn top of all this for those who want their own cars and can pay the premium for that, you will have to pay for FSD making those cars very profitable too. Likely Tesla will charge one rate for personal FSD and another for commercial FSD.\n\nFYI, I think the potential numbers I mention in term of robotaxi income is conservative, not aggressive. Also, Tesla doing this is a huge deal that will likely make it impossible for anyone to compete as Tesla will be safer due to having more data, which will mean people prefer to use Tesla Robotaxis over other brands, which will mean even more data to improve FSD flowing to Tesla.\n\nEnd of the day, if FSD is going to work out, it is possibly the end of the auto industry as we know it with Tesla emerging a victorious.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "If Tesla or Uber owns it, they can be regulated out of a city entirely, or to the point of unprofitability. How many big cities would this need to occur in before the scale became unprofitable? I’m not saying it will happen, just that it might— and that the number of mights that could make it nonviable are extensive. \n\nIn the case of Europe, their history of extremely tight regulations mixed with old world urban design makes me think that it would be one of the least lucrative and viable markets. \n\nBut on the contrary, in places like the developing world, micromobility is still integral to livery. Is your vision for Hanoi and Dhaka one filled with teslas instead of scooters? Not to mention, one of the big reasons local vehicles, tuktuks, and motorcycles are used is because they can be fixed with a mallet and some spanners by locals, and not require training an unskilled local workforce in EV repair or importing skilled labor. \n\nFurthermore, while I’ve not looked into the economics of Uber abroad, I suspect a big reason why you pay local prices is because drivers are using local cars with local gas in the local currency and purchasing power. Sure, Uber takes a cut of the local fare value, but in that case their overhead is close to zero. If Tesla is maintaining a fleet of teslas in the outskirts of Giza, their overhead is going to be astronomical, making it tough to compete with the guy on the 1982 Honda motor scooter. In other words, a robotaxi might bring in $50k/year in the US, but it won’t bring in the same dollar value in the developing world.\n\nIt also presupposes that untapped markets will welcome in the technology, and not require further testing and development for the local nuances and road rules. Having traveled by road in the developing world, there’s also not infrequently things like roadwork that requires you to reroute through a vacant lot or up onto a designated portion of sidewalk, or onto the other span of a half closed double span bridge. Or roads that are 1.5 lanes wide for 2 way traffic  or completely unmarked large intersections. \n\nNot to mention the economic impact that it would have because livery is often such an integral part of the economy. Economically, it’s the equivalent of asking a government to replace its local drivers and the local economic ecosystem surrounding them, with untested robotaxis that will financially support a Texas-based robotics-vehicle-AI firm and its shareholders. And that doesn’t even begin to address the cultural impact it would have. It’s fun to ride a black cab in London or whatever the local flavor is.

The economic benefits and better quality of life with more robotaxis will demand it.\n\nAlso, the $50,000 a year profit in the US was based off of 75% of the median income of a NYC taxi driver and ignored that a robotaxi can work longer hours and more days than a taxi driver so the income potential is much more for a robotaxi. $50,000 a year was conservative.\n\nAs to the developing world the profit per vehicle may be much less but as long as the cost to make the cars is low enough they should outcompete any person working.

The void that ridesharing filled was outdated hiring and pricing schemes, and things have somewhat re-equilibrated. Taxis are still prevalent in big cities and in many cases easier and cheaper than Uber  or Lyft these days, and many countries do not allow Uber, Lyft, or non-local equivalents. \n\nRealistically, ignoring all the regulatory and technical hurdles and costs, I’d imagine it would have to offer a service that is consistently cheaper than manned livery. I’ve taken multi-hour car rides for what amounted to only dollars per person in some countries, including generous tip. And you honestly think that Tesla will be able to come into somewhere like Columbia, build the facilities, staff, and supply chain to import and maintain a large fleet of autonomous EVs for an hour through the mountains from the airport to the labyrinth city for a comparable enough cost to meet routine local demand price points?

By reducing the expensive labor cost associated with taxis you have freed up capital to have safer vehicles.\n\n4. Whether robotaxis will replace mass transportation or not depends on a variety of factors and is not relevant for implementing them in the first place. That is a factor in terms of size of the market maybe.\n\n5. As to cost per person in some countries... very possible the labor cost is so cheap in some places and they are driving such cheap vehicles that it is impossible to compete with a vehicle that costs $20,000 or so to build. Obviously in those places such a service may not be viable. Personally I suspect the economics works out. \n\nYou mention Columbia, and a quick look shows the cheapest rate in Columbia (Bogota) per km is about $1.62 plus $1.46 start fare. Doing some math... A robotaxi that averages 10 hours of service per workday and 5 per weekend day and averages 3 km trips will bring in revrenue of $59K per year. The miles driven will be about 17K and assuming a small robotaxi with 5 miles per kW the electric cost will be about $728 per year. If the car lasts 5 years (that is under 100K miles) and costs $25,000 to manufacture that is an annual cost of $5,000 for the car, $728 for electric, and say another $10,000 for insurance, maintenance and cleaning (if not lower). So that robotaxi in Columbia will be making $40K+ a year in income.\n\nFyi, maintenance on a small car will be lower than current EV's as they will weigh less so tires should last longer. Also the above assumes 56 miles per day, which means you can have a tiny battery with 75 miles of range for that robotaxi, say a 15 kW battery. You can also build these robotaxis with different battery sizes according to demand for longer rides if necessary. When you get down to it you are really cutting the costs and weight of building an EV when you build for a robotaxi. Seems obvious that the only factor that really matters here will be the software.

The money people used to pay you for your service will now go to a US based tech and robotics company.’ Because implementing space age taxi service to financially benefits foreigners, and freeing up currently gainfully employed workers to ‘find other stuff to do’ seems like a low developmental priority. \n\nThe example you provide with Colombia is filled with arbitrary “assumptions,” not the least of which being that the infrastructure, labor force, and supply chains already exist, are functional, and have been paid for, in order to operate and maintain such a service. So, yeah, you can run those numbers that ignore the costs of importing vehicles and equipment to Andean cities, performing whatever legal and regulatory stuff needs to be done to gain local and national approval, building the necessary charging, maintenance, repair facilities, training the local workforce who are probably completely unfamiliar with the platforms (or importing foreigners), etc. Not to mention tariffs and taxes…in general, foreign companies entering, eliminating jobs, permanently and arbitrarily altering the culture and customs, while extracting the wealth is not well received by many communities, no matter how swanky the robot taxis are. So I would expect governments on all levels to require a non-insignificant cut of profits to do things like retrain those people who’s jobs were eliminated by robots. Not to mention the cost of repairs and parts, educating a workforce of distinct regional languages and dialects about updates and changes, etc. All of these costs will be baked in somewhere. \n\nA cab from Medellin airport to the city takes about 45 minutes and costs around 100,000 pesos, or about $26.50. 35% goes to federal tax in Colombia, which means net $17 goes to Tesla, in order to match it. Operating a car for 10 hours per day is going to increase wear beyond normal use and require more frequent service and replacement parts (which will be notably more expensive due to logistics and shipping), and continuously maintained supply chains. Tariffs on vehicle imports are also 35%, so your $25k vehicle is now $8750 more just to bring into the country, not including shipping. The inter-city roads in the country are also fairly poorly developed and go though gang controlled areas, and air is the more reliable method of transport, so you would likely need to fly the hundreds to thousands of robotaxis or arrange for costly secure and slow ground transport to each different city. Then there’s the issue of mapping and navigating the largely informal traffic flows and locality-specific traffic rules and norms. Also, legal and advertising budgets, political influencing, etc. \n\nhttps://medellinguru.com/taxi-guide/\n\nThis guy says his average 1-way taxi fare was $2.20 over the course of a year in Medellin. Doing all that work so a company can replace something that already exists and takes you wherever you need for an average of $2.20/ride seems extraordinarily unlikely to be profitable. Organizationally it feels like a completely unwieldy task to implement in a country like the USA that is fairly open with well codified and mostly (though not completely) uniform driving rules, let alone in those with less strict or defined road rules. \n\nIt’s hugely different for something like Uber.
