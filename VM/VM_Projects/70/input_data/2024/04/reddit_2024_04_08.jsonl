Perhaps not. But there is absolutely nothing real about Tesla's FSD. With its current hardware it will most likely never get past level 2 autonomous, very far away from where it needs to be to be safer than humans driving.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "OK kiddo.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "and there we go, a kool aid drinker as I said initially. too easy to spot you locos out.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Why are you here? This is a sub for people who invest in TSLA and like to discuss issues in a constructive way. You can disagree with any statement you like, as long as you can back up your argument with meaningful reasons. But insulting others in an ad hominem attack is not useful to anybody.\n\nI'm quite happy to concede that FSD may never get to the full robotaxi no-steering-wheel stage. I'm also very impressed (for the first time) with what I am seeing with 12.3.3, especially given the fact that it is all neural network machine learning now, with iterations happening at a much faster rate than before. \n\nI deal with road trauma every day of my working life. Humans suck at driving. It's the second biggest cause of life-years lost in developed countries. It kills young people as often as old people. It's a pandemic that we seem to have accepted. 40,000 deaths per year in the US, 1000 deaths per year in my country Australia. And 10 times those numbers seriously injured every year.\n\nStupid people are allowed to drive. People drive while drunk. People use their phones while driving. People do not notice or do not obey rules. So people die. Often it other people that die, the pedestrians or cyclists or the good drivers, as a bad driver slams into them. I can assure you that working in a trauma surgery theatre for 3 years, the injuries and effects on the families still horrify me.\n\nThere has got to be a better way. Public transport is safer, flying is safer. Autonomously driving cars are a very new technology. You can be sceptical, that's healthy, but it's very very early days in development. I am confident in the future (5, 10, 15 years) that autonomously driving cars will revolutionise transport and we will look back at the days when humans used to drive, and crash, with some amusement or horror at how things used to be in the old days.\n\nI hate Musk on a personal level. I am impressed with his companies. I dont care how we get to autonomous driving, whether it's Tesla, Waymo or some other company. I just want to carnage to stop, and autonomously driving cars may be the way we get there.\n\nFeel free to reply with a poorly-punctuate one-line catch-phrase ridden insult.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I don't follow this sub, but musk stuff is pushed on all social media. The ironic thing is, that if you are truly about road safety, you'd be slamming musk. He has lied repeatedly about his fsd's capability time and time again, many times to pump Tesla stock. \n\nI am all for autonomous driving bringing down auto injuries and fatalities. And I support anybody with integrity that gets us there. The thing is, nothing about musk or Tesla, they are so interwoven, has any integrity about safe fsd. \nIn fact, their hype is responsible for actual accidents and fatalities. \n\nIf you think you are really well about safety, you'd be calling out musk and his fsd nonsense that is truly dangerous. \n\nFeel free to do research and get to reality. Then you can really be a part of the solution. Otherwise, you're just part of the problem.\n\nEnjoy the stock of a highly unethical company led by a man with no ethics including specifically about safe autonomous driving. \n\nPut your money where your mouth is, or people will call you out. Deal with it.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Musk is an obnoxious man-child. He tweets stupid shit without filtering. I do not like his personality.\n\nLet's compare him to the Saudi oil princes and other oil barons. They pump oil, responsible for 30% of the world's [carbon dioxide emissions](https://ourworldindata.org/emissions-by-fuel) causing climate change. They use [slave labour](https://www.walkfree.org/global-slavery-index/country-studies/saudi-arabia/). They [behead people](https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/03/15/saudi-arabia-mass-execution-81-men) for slightly varied religious beliefs and to maintain their grip on power. The Koch brothers [influence politics](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/sep/26/koch-brothers-americans-for-prosperity-rightwing-political-group) purely so they can keep making oil profits. Shell Oil were [responsible for executions, environmental destruction and human rights violations in Nigeria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_Nigeria#Controversies). Exxon and BP oil spills are well known, but there are major oil spills [every day](https://oceana.org/blog/oil-kills/).\n\nIn contrast, Tesla has made over 6 million electric cars. Each car reduces carbon dioxide emissions by 20 tons over its lifetime compared to an ICE car. So at current numbers, we are looking at 120 million tonnes of CO2 reduction, and that will continue to increase as electric cars (not just Tesla) gain market share. Musk was instrumental in the transition to electric cars. \n\nSo my take is this: Musk is vocal, obnoxious, immature, speaks outside his expertise. But there are far far more evil men in the world who don't tweet their evil-ness and so they fly under the radar as far as the general public goes. We should direct our outrage proportionally to the more evil people.\n\nAs far as FSD safety goes, we should look at hard data, rather than anecdotal reports. I am open to look at peer-reviewed data, not sensationalist websites. Autonomous driving and FSD doesn't have to be perfect, and crashes and deaths will happen. It just has to be significantly better than human drivers, I can assure you humans are very bad at driving.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "It's never a good thing when you have to compare your guy to other really really shitty people to say, oh he's not so bad. And what's your point, we can't comment on how evil Musk is now because there are worse people? That's a terrible argument.\n\nAnd let's see what Musk is and has been about for some time now. He literally posts insane conspiracy theories on Twitter non stop. He has literally created a safe space for nazis and white nationalists, the worst of the worst - and he is a total hypocrite about free speech. He posts a ton of evil shit. About illegals voting, and DEI is causing planes to crash and bad surgeries. Besides the racist shit, he has been rabidly anti-semitic, amazingly mysoginistic, and basically just full of hate. He has also endorsed voting for Trump this fall. I'd say endorsing evil is pretty bad. And it's so evil because he literally has this huge platform and cult of followers. There are so many evil posts he makes because that's like his main job now, being a horrible person on Twitter and anywhere else he gets a platform.\n\nMusk's contribution times have come and gone. He did what good he had in him and spent that a long time ago. He has been a total snake oil salesman stock pump and dumper and spreader of horrific shit for a while now. The fact you, as someone espousing safe driving via autonomous driving, can let it slide that he has used inferior FSD claims for years now, to sell a substandard product that will never get past level 2 (he doesn't have the right hardware). That's literally spreading falsehoods about FSD to make money, for years and years.. That's fucking dangerous. It has literally caused deaths and accidents. You should be completely taking him to task on his actual FSD claims, which is the thing you claim to care about the most.\n\nUntil you put your money where your mouth is, it's nothing but platitudes. You can't support Elon anymore and say you are really for safe FSD for humanity. He is the antithesis of that, constantly lying and pushing substandard FSD out there while making insane claims about it. There are other car manufacturers with far more ethics who are truly doing this the right way and safely, and have reached Level 3 cars coming out for the public soon, in limited and safe ways, and others like Waymo who are essentially at level 4-5 already but still trialing more and more to be totally 100% sure it's the best. Instead you defend Elon. bad look.\n\nGood luck.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Good healthy discussion. \n\nI'm not defending Musk's actions re twitter. I unreservedly defend Musk's launching the world's transition to electric cars. You can like some aspects of people while deploring other aspects. it a sign of nuanced thinking.\n\nMy argument about \"there are worse people\" is not about \"there are worse people\". It is about the non-commensurate outrage that people have. Most people still drive ICE cars. They fill up with fossil fuels. Much of those fuels comes from ethically deplorable sources. And yet there is very little outrage in the general population or the daily news about the Russian oil oligarchs funding the Ukraine war, or the Saudi oil prices executing hundreds to maintain power, or the Koch brothers actively warping public opinion about climate change and politicians for their own profits. I would eager that those thoughts don't enter most people's minds as they fill up with petrol.\n\nYou rail against Musk and his tweets. Rightly so. But why only him?
