{"title": "Market Truly is Risk Free", "selftext": "Here we are in month 6 of the most epic bull market rally ever and it's not too late to join because there's zero chance of it falling. There's not much else that can be said. I continue to see posts about the market falling or people wanting to short and as I've continued to say, there is ZERO CHANCE that we ever experience any meaningful drop in the SPY or QQQ. It's just impossible. Even if there's no rate cuts this year (which there won't be) it still won't go down. It really doesn't matter. Nothing can bring this market down.\n\nEvery time  I make a post like this I get the same stupid responses like this has to be the top or I'm an idiot or regard. \n\nIf you haven't noticed this market is actually manipulated and rigged to never go down. What happens is that every time there's any small drop so much unlimited money is thrown at it. It's like the thing is blocked from downside and there's clearly a force preventing this from ever going down. You might get an odd red day, but it will go right back up like we saw again this week.\n\nThose that follow price action will agree with me. I don't know how anyone can possible ever think this has a chance of falling. I don't care what it did in 2022 or in the past. From the time I first made a post to now, the market is way up and that will never change. You can bookmark this one as it will also go way higher from here. \n\nNo down move is sustainable. It's as simple as that. We are pumping way more and the QQQ will hit 500. \n\nI can't wait to read the comments.
