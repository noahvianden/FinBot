What's in the models?** \n\nHe runs the 26 different models/algos (don't overthink algos as something fancy, think excel models) using different components (open interest, block orders, expected move, fibonnaci-based levels, etc.) to then get a range of outcomes, and then plots that in different manners as a way to visualize where there agreement or disagreement. Some models use volatility (VIX) components, some don't. And in the end will get 4 main outputs based on those. It may seem arbitrary to why there are 4 final outputs that are most important - but they are.\n\nOver nearly 30 years of trial and error and refining the inputs, and some help from people to get it coded into the new software, he has found something that works for him. Plenty of people make their own ranges in that manner, so it's nothing out of the ordinary. \n\nIt's the length of time Vet has put into this ONE system that is his personal edge, and knowing with confidence the success rate of the ranges is why he has made a career off trading it.
