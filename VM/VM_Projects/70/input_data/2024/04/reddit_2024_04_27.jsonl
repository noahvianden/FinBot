What's in the models?** \n\nHe runs the 26 different models/algos (don't overthink algos as something fancy, think excel models) using different components (open interest, block orders, expected move, fibonnaci-based levels, etc.) to then get a range of outcomes, and then plots that in different manners as a way to visualize where there agreement or disagreement. Some models use volatility (VIX) components, some don't. And in the end will get 4 main outputs based on those. It may seem arbitrary to why there are 4 final outputs that are most important - but they are.\n\nOver nearly 30 years of trial and error and refining the inputs, and some help from people to get it coded into the new software, he has found something that works for him. Plenty of people make their own ranges in that manner, so it's nothing out of the ordinary. \n\nIt's the length of time Vet has put into this ONE system that is his personal edge, and knowing with confidence the success rate of the ranges is why he has made a career off trading it. You aren't going to ever get an exact response to \"what exactly goes into each of the models because I dont trust the outputs\" - that's so people don't replicate it. \n\nIf you don't trust the system/individual then I highly encourage you don't trade it. I would say that for anyone and any system - don't risk money on any system you are new to. **But maybe you can learn something from tracking them over time and to make your own ranges, or get more faith in Vet's work!** \n\nThe main thing is encouragement that everyone can make their own ranges using all the same type of information provided, and we all need to start somewhere. Even if it's making ranges using just EM. \n\nI know the guy, so I trust him. These posts aren't for validation. He will post the same things as he does because it works and he likes to coach/help people, because there were people that did the same for him in the 90s/00s. Sometimes paying knowledge and experience forward can build good grace.\n\nBut overall I think it's great that people are providing feedback about how he communicates the systems.
