First of all, they license all of their software to these companies, so you're just flat wrong that they are not part and parcel of these breakthroughs. But also they have several partners and direct investments into this space. [See here](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/self-driving-cars/partners/). \n\nNot that I'm confident autonomous driving will be solved anytime soon, but maybe.

First, don't lie about working at Nvidia when you clearly don't know much about the company or what it's doing. Second, stop gathering your data from idiotic news outlets and instead investigate the company yourself, or at least read in depth analysis, like SemiAnalysis. Third, stop being so fucking hubristic and overconfident in your views. Your comments amount to hand waving, and yet you think you have a highly detailed thesis, where you're buying puts that will almost assuredly never be ITM and are probably just going to lose you money, however small. \n\nIs AI a bubble? Maybe, but I don't think the evidence suggests that at all, and you haven't even remotely made a compelling case. In fact, you haven't even made a case at all. You just keep *asserting* it.

The Chinese tech giant began accepting pre-orders on Saturday, just days ahead of Apple’s highly anticipated iPhone 16 launch, which is scheduled for early Tuesday morning in Beijing. While Huawei has announced that the Mate XT will officially go on sale on September 20, pricing details remain under wraps.\n\nThis launch marks a significant moment in the competitive smartphone landscape, particularly in China, where Apple has recently fallen out of the top five smartphone vendors, according to Canalys. Huawei ranked fourth in the second quarter, with 10.6 million units shipped, while Apple shipped 10 million devices in the first quarter. While Huawei and other Chinese brands have already ventured into foldable phones, Apple has yet to introduce its own model in this emerging category.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2024/09/09/huaweis-tri-fold-phone-gets-2point7-million-pre-orders-before-iphone-16-launch.html", "id": "1fcoccn", "created_utc": 1725885287.0, "score": 94, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 66, "comments": [{"body": "Am I the only one that thinks foldable phones are a gimmick?", "score": 157, "replies": [{"body": "Nope", "score": 31, "replies": []}, {"body": "If you were in China you might be, I guess.", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "Doesn't seem like a gimmick.
