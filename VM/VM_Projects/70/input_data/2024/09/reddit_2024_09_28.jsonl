Love how everyone says Intel needs to take drastic steps to turn around the company, and when they do so like cutting the dividend, everyone jumps ship.\n\nBut most of all, love how everyone's been doom and gloom for 4 years when it takes years for the decisions 4 years ago to show. And now everyone all of a sudden wants to buy up Intel, the very same company everyone says has no value, is now being courted like The Bachelor. I hope Intel does not give up the ghost. If 18A cooks, they will grab huge market share from everyone else.\n\nMost people are regarded. Don't think like the herd.

In addition to product value they will start to eat market share from TSMC. I see it being weighted much more towards that than product. That's why all the Capex is going to foundry and not product.
