When would you use one over the other? Quantitatively, how do their risk profiles differ? How does profitability differ?\n\nHere are two ways (not the only ways):\n\n1. The long fly is a debit to open while an iron fly is a credit to open. This means that the profit/loss mechanism is inverse for each and the evolution over time is inverse for each. For example, if a large amount of theta decay is expected over your holding time, you are better off with an iron fly than a long fly. This is because a credit trade profits by selling high and buying back low, so you benefit when the future value of the fly is lower, whereas a debit trade profits by buying low and selling high. A similar time evolution happens for IV. The rise or fall of IV over time impacts the choice of debit vs. credit.\n\n1. Market conditions may influence the relative value of puts vs. calls.

One of the obstacles is that bid/ask spreads on options can be 100x wider than for stock, and volume 1000x lower, so tight stops rarely work on options. Getting the option contract and the shares to perfectly align on break-even when the spreads are so different is pretty tough. You'll almost always have some slippage on the option leg.\n\n> I'm trying to get basically less risk for my reward using an options hedge.\n\nThat's essentially impossible. When you reduce (rewarded) risk, you inevitably reduce potential reward. Case in point: Options cost money. In the scenario where your stock trade wins, the cost of the hedging option is a dead loss and a drag on your total return.\n\nTaking a step back, why are you so focused on hedging risk to zero?
