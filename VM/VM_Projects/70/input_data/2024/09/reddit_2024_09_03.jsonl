Ordinarily, if you bought a call, it might have to only move $2.50 for you to begin making money but since you're also buying a put, it will have to move more. That's okay, as long as you feel the market will make big moves, regardless of direction. Today was a perfect example.

When you know there's big news coming, like GDP, or JOLT, or anything else that impacts the market in a big way, but you have no idea if it's good or bad, it's better to take a smaller profit by using a straddle, than risk everything by betting on a direction and being wrong 50% of the time.
