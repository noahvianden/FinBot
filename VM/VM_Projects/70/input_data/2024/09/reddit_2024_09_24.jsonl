Yet, they have key production growth, and are prepped for the acceleration of their product demand with both commercial vehicles and consumer vehicles.¬† \n\n**Factory Upgrades and Focus on Margin**\n\nRivian has guided towards seeing better margins this fall, in part from the re-tooling seen this last May. [Normal Site Retooling](https://www.automotivedive.com/news/rivian-completes-plant-retooling-pivotal-to-profitability/715673/) \n\nThey are continuing to invest in their site, with approved plans to build out a larger space and prepare for R2 production, both of these upgrades leading to over 215,000 units of capacity across the R1 / R2 / Commercial platforms they offer. [R2 Site Expansion](https://electrek.co/2024/08/20/rivian-rivn-approved-major-plant-expansion-r2/#:~:text=Rivian%20gets%20the%20green%20light%20for%20massive%20plant%20expansion&text=The%20amendments%20to%20its%20site,ft%2C%20or%20roughly%205%25) \n\nFurther, the VW Partnership further mentioned below has already brought tailwinds and initial cost savings, and will likely further support long term profitability. [VW Partnership Cost Savings](https://www.manufacturingdive.com/news/rivian-supplier-cost-savings-vw-partnership-earnings-q2/723660/)\n\n**Production Analysis**¬†\n\nRecently in another group, a user posted their production analysis, and it‚Äôs following Tesla‚Äôs quite well: [Rivian vs. Tesla Production Ramp](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rivian/comments/1f2yk9y/comparing_rivian_and_teslas_production_ramp/?share_id=67dj9Qr_8DjKXpFglZzfQ&utm_content=1&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_source=share&utm_term=1)¬†\n\nWhile Rivian is still early, they‚Äôve already shown what the R2 ([R2 / R3 walkthrough with RJ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0Gt_PUyldc)¬†) and R3 - ([R3 Design walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WoBBibT_IAI)) -  will look like, and people are EXCITED for them to come out in 2026 (R3X potentially fall '26 or later).¬†¬†\n\nWhile we see headwinds in the EV industry, as time goes on EV infrastructure will continue to increase, furthering EV adoption (including Rivian).¬†¬†It doesn't seem like Tesla will be the only pure-play EV company to survive.\n\nSo who is buying Rivians currently?¬†¬†\n\nTesla owners, among others. More Rivians are being sold, and they are starting to be a choice among Subaru owners (a sticky owner usually), Tesla owners trading up, and even first time EV owners. Plenty of people from EVs to ICE vehicles are trading up and into Rivians, and are loving them!¬†¬†\n\nIt makes sense the love for Rivian current owners have ‚Äì it is a beautifully designed vehicle around the user, made with intelligent features people love to use from adventuring to everyday driving.¬†\n\nImportantly, it‚Äôs also built around the technological architecture of the vehicle. Instead of other vehicles with 100 different computers that don‚Äôt talk well with each other, Rivian is building each platform as a tech-first platform, which is why VW ‚Äì who has struggled with their own software and advancing tech internally ‚Äì has partnered with Rivian, to the tune of $5 Billion when the company was worth $10 Billion.¬†  \n¬†  \nVW still has $4B more to invest in¬†Rivian, so adding that to the $8B in cash they had as of their last earnings report, and Rivian is worth more today and long term.¬†\n\n**Partnerships**¬†\n\nRivian has some large backing, between the Amazon contract they are producing for, and the VW Rivian Partnership. VW is a large player with many brands like Porsche, VW, Audi, and more ‚Äì but they‚Äôve struggled trying to build better tech internally. For a group seeing headwinds in the industry and China, partnering with Rivian isn‚Äôt a risk they would take if they didn‚Äôt need to ‚Äì while the partnership is important for Rivian, it‚Äôs incredibly important for VW as well, including the level of due diligence needed for a $5B investment in Rivian.¬†([VW Struggles with Software](https://www.emergingtechbrew.com/stories/2024/07/11/volkswagen-rivian-joint-venture)) Notably, while we talk about Rivian vehicle production and ramp, it's Rivian's tech-first focus and the way they've built a vehicle around the technology which also differentiates them and attracts VW to this deal.\n\nAdditionally, while Rivian continues to produce and deliver vans for Amazon, they are now also able to sell similar vans to other companies. While Amazon was the first, this adds to the moat Rivian is working to develop that defends their positioning ‚Äì commercial EV sale -.[Rivian Commercial Vans](https://rivian.com/fleet). As the demand for last-mile delivery grows, Rivian is well positioned to take market share in the commercial space as well as consumer space.¬†\n\n**Team**¬†\n\nWhile Tesla has a crazy cult following, combined with Elon Musk‚Äôs cult following, RJ is similarly an engineer at heart but is a down to earth guy that also has a PH.D. from MIT. His exec team has experience across the auto landscape, having experience previously at Tesla, Chrysler, Volvo, Stellantis, and Jeep, as well as Apple, JPM, and more. His team is experienced across different facets of the industry, and brings both a tech focus with auto experience into Rivian's design, production, and overall customer focus.\n\n**Summary**\n\nEVs have plenty of headwinds, but considering how much existing customers love the product, the excitement for what is coming for the brand, the cash on hand and backing from VW, the commercial vehicle side, and overall positioning, I think the risk is worth the significant upside Rivian is positioned for.
