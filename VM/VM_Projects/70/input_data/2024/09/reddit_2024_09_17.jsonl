{"title": "BlackRock and Microsoft plan $30bn fund to invest in AI infrastructure", "selftext": "  \n[https://www.ft.com/content/4441114b-a105-439c-949b-1e7f81517deb](https://www.ft.com/content/4441114b-a105-439c-949b-1e7f81517deb)\n\nBlackRock is preparing to launch a more than $30bn artificial intelligence investment fund with technology giant Microsoft to build data centres and energy projects to meet growing demands stemming from AI.  \n\nThe financial partnership, which BlackRock is launching with its new infrastructure investment unit, Global Infrastructure Partners, would be one of the biggest investment vehicles ever raised on Wall Street. Microsoft and MGX, the Abu Dhabi-backed investment company, are general partners in the fund. Nvidia, the fast-growing chipmaker, will advise on factory design and integration. \n\nThe investment vehicle is aimed at addressing the staggering power and digital infrastructure demands of building AI products that are expected to face severe capacity bottlenecks in coming years. The computing power of AI requires far more energy than previous technological innovations and has strained existing energy infrastructure. \n\nDubbed the Global AI Investment Partnership, the effort seeks to raise up to $30bn in equity investments and leverage that to support up to an additional $70bn in debt financing. \n\nThe fund would mark GIP’s first big fund since the private infrastructure investment group agreed to be acquired by BlackRock for $12.5bn earlier this year. That deal is due to close in October.\n\nBlackRock, the world’s largest money manager, has highlighted the energy sector as one of its top opportunities for growth. “Mobilising private capital to build AI infrastructure like data centres and power will unlock a multitrillion-dollar long-term investment opportunity,” Larry Fink, BlackRock chief executive, said in a statement.

Earlier this year Microsoft agreed to back $10bn in renewable electricity projects built by Canada’s Brookfield Asset Management. Microsoft has made a commitment to ensure 100 per cent of its energy consumption is matched by zero carbon energy purchases by 2030.  \n\n“The country and the world are going to need more capital investment to accelerate the development of the AI infrastructure needed. This kind of effort is an important step,” said Brad Smith, Microsoft’s president. \n\nMGX was created earlier this year with the backing of Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund Mubadala to advance the country’s progress in AI. It has been in talks to invest in Open AI’s next funding round. \n\nIn 2017, Blackstone announced plans for a $40bn infrastructure vehicle with backing from Saudi Arabia, and Brookfield last year raised $28bn for what was described as the largest ever infrastructure fund. \n\nThe International Energy Agency estimates that global electricity consumption by data centres could surpass 1,000 terawatt-hours by 2026, more than twice the amount used in 2022.  Recommended LexBig Tech Data centres have turned Big Tech into big spenders Premium content \n\n“Accelerated computing and generative AI are driving a growing need for AI infrastructure for the next industrial revolution,” Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s founder, said in a statement. \n\nIn the US, which hosts one-third of the world’s data centres, electricity demand is rising rapidly for the first time in two decades, driven partly by these energy-intensive facilities. A report from Grid Strategies indicates that five-year projections for electricity demand growth in the US have nearly doubled over the past year, increasing from 2.6 per cent to 4.7 per cent. \n\n“There is a clear need to mobilise significant amounts of private capital to fund investments in essential infrastructure,” Bayo Ogunlesi, GIP’s chief executive, said in a statement.", "id": "1fjdmpw", "created_utc": 1726613876.0, "score": 430, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 91, "comments": [{"body": "Welcome to r/stocks!\n\nFor stock recommendations please see our portfolio sticky, sort by hot, it's the first sticky, or see [past portfolio stickies here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3A%22Rate+My+Portfolio%22&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all)\n\nFor beginner advice, brokerage info, book recommendations, even advanced topics and more, please read our [Wiki here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index)\n\nIf you're wondering **why a stock moved** a certain way, check out [Finviz](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=spy) which aggregates the most news for almost every stock, but also see [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/), and even [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/).\n\nAlso include *some* [due diligence](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/duediligence.asp) to this post or it may be removed if it's low effort.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
