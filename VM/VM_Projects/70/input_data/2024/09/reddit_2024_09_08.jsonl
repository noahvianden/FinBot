{"title": "As public school quality deteriorates, LRN enrollments will increase", "selftext": "**Intro**\n\nLRN (Stride, Inc.) provides online curriculum and online teachers for homeschooling and blended schools. In blended schools, students receive online education but attend physical schools. These educational services are often tuition free because many school districts have automatically renewing, long term contracts with LRN.\n\nThe company provides educational services for all students, including AP classes, as well as special education.  But they specifically target several groups: students with disabilities (dyslexia, autism, etc.), families that move frequently due to work, and high school students heavily involved in extracurricular activities (mostly sports).  \n\nLRN student enrollments spiked up at the beginning of the pandemic.  They increased 57% in the 2020-21 academic year: to 195,000 vs. 124,000 the previous year.  As restrictions were lifted, enrollments decreased.  Enrollments were down: 5,000 in ‘21-22 and 16,000 in ‘22-23. But, in ‘23-24, enrollments surprisingly sharply increased by 20,000.  Enrollments and guidance for the full ‘24-25 academic year will be announced in October. There are multiple factors that will lead to accelerating enrollment and earnings growth.\n\n**Standardized test scores and behavior**\n\n[Reading and math scores have dropped](https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=38) 7 & 14 scale points respectively from their all time highs a decade ago. Nationwide, USA reading scores are now at levels last seen in 1975.  And math scores have not been this low since 1990.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wyohejt5wknd1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d10a86f9cdb6910370e89ac2be18cb049e935220\n\n\n\nIn a May 2024 survey, 75% of schools reported student lack of focus or attention had a moderate or severe effect on learning.  And 79% of schools reported some level of verbal abuse by students directed at teachers or staff.\n\nStandardized test scores & behavior/attention problems correlate with quality of education. If parents believe the quality of education is lower, they are more likely to search for available alternatives.  \n\n**Disabled student population and staffing**\n\n[In the most recently available data,](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/07/24/what-federal-education-data-shows-about-students-with-disabilities-in-the-us/) there are 7.3 million disabled US students.  This is a 14% increase from 10 years prior.  The most common type of disability is a “specific learning disability”, like dyslexia or ADHD.  LRN specifically caters to these types of students because they are able to provide specialized services for them remotely.  \n\nSchool districts often have great difficulty filling these positions (as well as positions for general education). [ This report found](https://www.edweek.org/leadership/retention-is-the-missing-ingredient-in-special-education-staffing/2024/05) 62% of respondents said it was harder, and only 6% said it was easier, to fill special education positions compared to the previous year. The data backs this up.  In Spring 2022, (when there were extreme labor shortages and wage inflation),[ 46% of schools](https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/spp/results.asp#student-behavior-may24-chart-5) said they still have special education positions to fill for the upcoming academic year.  In spring 2024, that percentage increased to 51% of schools! And the situation for general education isn’t much better with 37% of respondents having a general elementary position to fill in Spring 2022 vs. 44%  in Spring 2024.  \n\nThe overall labor situation in the USA is much better now than it was in 2022, but that’s not true at all for general & special education.  These current staffing difficulties not only cause more parents to look for standard public school alternatives, they also pressure school districts to outsource education services to organizations like LRN.\n\n**Valuation**\n\nNormalized trailing p/e ratio is 20.6.  And normalized earnings growth YOY is 51%: $3.86 EPS in June 2024 for trailing twelve months vs. $2.58 in June 2023.  That would give a very low PEG ratio of 0.4.  (If someone wants to check my math on these numbers, that would be great.)\n\nRevenue growth is good at 11%, but not as strong as earnings growth because I think they did some cost cutting on marketing.  But still, we have a p/e of 20.6 for a company with good growth and fundamentals.  \n\nPart of the reason it is priced cheaply  could be lingering worries about AI progress.  In early 2023, there was a sharp selloff of some online education companies.  Investors believed AI chatbots would replace preprogrammed education material and even reduce the need for live teaching.  But, I think progress has generally been slower than what was expected in late 2022 & early 2023.  And some of those worries probably need to be reevaluated because I think we are still a long way off from the replacement of live teaching.\n\n**Position**\n\n170 shares.  I plan to hold until at least late October, after enrollments and academic year guidance have been released.\n\nPlease backtest before making any major changes in your portfolio to understand historic volatility and risk.", "id": "1fbwgxe", "created_utc": 1725798019.0, "score": 31, "upvote_ratio": 0.61, "num_comments": 85, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 9 | **First Seen In WSB** | 8 months ago\n**Total Comments** | 64 | **Previous Best DD** | [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1cwobk1/fmc_may_soar_on_a_spike_in_pesticide_demand/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1f0374m/ohi_7_yield_and_nav_will_moon/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1fbwgxe/as_public_school_quality_deteriorates_lrn/) \n**Account Age** | 5 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Bold to assume Americans like to learn", "score": 106, "replies": [{"body": "Or that Americans don’t use school as a daycare", "score": 72, "replies": [{"body": "Teacher here.
