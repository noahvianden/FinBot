{"title": "Boeing freezes hiring in sweeping cost cuts as it grapples with factory worker strike", "selftext": "Boeing announced sweeping cost cuts including a hiring freeze and a pause on nonessential staff travel to preserve cash as it deals with a strike of more than 30,000 factory workers..\n\nBoeing factory workers, mostly in the Seattle area, started walking off the job early Friday after overwhelmingly rejecting a tentative labor deal and to strike.\n\n“We are working in good faith to reach a new contract agreement that reflects their feedback and enables operations to resume,” CFO Brian West said in a staff note on Monday. ” However, our business is in a difficult period. This strike jeopardizes our recovery in a significant way and we must take necessary actions to preserve cash and safeguard our shared future.”\n\nThe financial impact of the strike will depend on how long it lasts but Boeing is focused on conserving cash, West said at a Morgan Stanley conference Friday. He said the company’s new CEO, Kelly Ortberg, wants to get back to the bargaining table right away to reach a new deal.\n\nOn Friday, Moody’s put all of Boeing’s credit ratings on review for a downgrade and Fitch Ratings said a prolonged strike could put Boeing at risk of a downgrade. That could drive up the borrowing costs of a manufacturer that already has mounting debt.\n\nBoeing burned about $8 billion in the first half of the year as production slowed in the wake of a near-catastrophic door-panel blowout at the start of the year.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/16/boeing-freezes-hiring-cost-cuts-factory-worker-strike.html", "id": "1fi6xj1", "created_utc": 1726499081.0, "score": 344, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 80, "comments": [{"body": "Boeing makes moves to preserve cash during strike...\n\nIt reads like an onion article.", "score": 67, "replies": []}, {"body": "This is what happens when you have accountants and MBAs running a technology company.", "score": 113, "replies": [{"body": "So true.

I remember when I first started investing and also thought Buffett's word was law, You'll grow out of it eventually.\n\n  \nBuffett thrives in recessions where intrinsic value and fundamentals are the only thing that matter. In case you haven't noticed, we're not in a recession, and Buffett has been making pretty bad calls since the start of 2020 in a growth driven market. Don't fall into the trap of thinking that their $1T portfolio moves the same way as your $20k portfolio. I'm fairly certain I've heard Buffett explicitly say that if he had <$1M, he would be investing completely differently.\n\nHere's some advice, since you're obviously quite new and inexperienced to investing based on your worshipping Buffett. **No one knows how the market will move**. There's no stock market prophets out there. There's a lot of educated guesses, but they've all been wrong on several occasions and this includes Buffett.
