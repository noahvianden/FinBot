{"title": "SeptemBEAR is a fluke and a lie", "selftext": "I‚Äôve seen lots of posts on here talking about how the coming month is historically the worst in the market.  I‚Äôve seen plenty of terribly presented charts, half effort dds and more.  \n\nControversial opinion, but I have reason to believe this September will be full of pleasant surprises.  Why you ask?  Well, since I have you, please read carefully‚Ä¶\n\nI‚Äôm regarded.  Aspiring restarted.  Nothing I say is close to financial advice you should take, especially considering my portfolio is down 50% in the last week alone.  But why is that you ask?  Glad you asked.  It‚Äôs because I‚Äôm balls deep in calls on retail and tech.\n\nEveryone is saying since we‚Äôre headed into a ‚Äùrecession‚Äù that consumer spending is on hold and tech is on the decline.  Ridiculous.  Dollar General, Walmart, and Target showed that the consumer is simply becoming smarter and cost effective.  Following the deals and shopping effectively for low cost items en quantity.  \n\nI‚Äôm 20 something years old and everyone I know (excluding myself) has given up on the prospect of owning a home.  My friends are buying Amazon, chewy, Walmart, Wayfair, and any affordable brands to better their lifestyle but not break the bank.\n\nAnyway. Onto tech.  Many on this subreddit have been adamant that Nvidia (and tech as a whole) has reached unreasonable earnings ratios and is unsustainable.  While in the short term this may be true, this is honestly astonishing.  Right now, companies like Google and Microsoft are likely the lowest evaluations you‚Äôll ever see in your lifetime.  Nvidia likewise.  None of these behemoths are going anywhere.  You likely won‚Äôt see the monstrous growth you saw with Nvidia last quarter continuing (although I can‚Äôt be sure on that) but that is no reason to think that opportunity is dead.  Google in particular has deep connections to biomedical AI solutions, which albeit premature now, will likely pay off 100 fold once people harness the power of AI biology simulation, including protein folding, hormone distribution, genetic manipulation.\n\nRestartless, the coming rate cuts in my estimate will be surprisingly bullish, with some volatility mixed in.  Sure, historically rate cuts have been bearish, but we are in unprecedented times.  The consumer is doing well, people have given up on saving for a first time home and everyone is avidly consuming.  I anticipate we run up until rate cuts, launch up more, and I can‚Äôt claim to know what happens next.\n\nThanks for listening to my Ted talk.
