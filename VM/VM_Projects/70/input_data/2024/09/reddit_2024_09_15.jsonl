{"title": "Microsoft Bubble?", "selftext": "So, I‚Äôve been kicking this around, and I figured you guys would be the best judge of it.\n\nIs there a Microsoft ‚ÄòBubble‚Äô (I dunno if I‚Äôm using that right, it feels weird). Anyway, here‚Äôs my thinking?\n\nAt what point do AAA games start marketing you microtransactions? From the very start, they‚Äôre that valuable. So, what does that mean for the RRP? It has lesser value than microtransactions. Played out, there‚Äôs a break-even point where forgoing the RRP altogether will still be worth it. Are we seeing that already, faithful reader?\n\nThe cutthroat efficiency of capitalism will mean that the endgame will be all games. Free. Forever.\n\nSo where does that leave Xbox and game pass? I‚Äôll ask you a better question. What does that mean for the ‚Äòx as a service‚Äô model?\n\nYou buy Disney+, do you pay 5 on top for the Mandalorian?\n\nThis is the endgame of capitalism. It‚Äôs efficiency is too ruthless. It is cannibalising its customers. Everything in the software service will cede to microtransactions. Service models will become redundant.\n\nSo, yeah, short Microsoft. Tips welcome. \n\nCAVEAT EMPTORRRR: I‚Äôm broke and clueless. I offer this up to wayyy finer minds than mine.
