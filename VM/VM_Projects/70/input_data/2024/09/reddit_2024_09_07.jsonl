{"title": "Why the Market Bottomed on Friday: A Technical Breakdown", "selftext": "This past Friday, we witnessed the definitive bottoming of the market‚Äîmark it on your calendars, folks. After weeks of volatility, fear-mongering about inflation, the Federal Reserve, and the dreaded looming government shutdown, the market miraculously found its footing. But don‚Äôt worry, it wasn‚Äôt because of any sound economic or fiscal policy. No, no. It was because of ‚Äútechnical factors,‚Äù the magical force that makes or breaks Wall Street, apparently just in time to avoid that pesky government shutdown. Let‚Äôs dissect the genius behind this market bottoming and sprinkle in some wild predictions while we‚Äôre at it (hello, Meta $600 by 11/11).\n\n### The Technical Wizards Have Spoken\n\nFirst off, let‚Äôs talk about those sacred ‚Äútechnical factors.‚Äù You know the ones. Moving averages, Fibonacci retracements, the ever-mystical RSI‚Äîbasically, the tools Wall Street traders use to pretend they know the future. When in doubt, just slap a chart up with some squiggly lines, and boom, you have yourself a market bottom. \n\nHere‚Äôs how it really went down. After bouncing off the 200-day moving average like a trampoline, the market decided that was low enough. Why? Because technical analysis says so, duh. The bulls rushed in, declaring victory over the bears, with many citing the ‚Äúgolden cross‚Äù as a sign from the heavens. We all know the ‚Äúgolden cross‚Äù works because it sounds fancy, not because it has any bearing on, you know, real economic indicators.\n\nMeanwhile, as the MACD turned positive (whatever that means), everyone agreed that Friday was it. No more dropping. This is the bottom, people! Forget about all those pesky things like inflation, interest rates, and the fact that the economy is possibly teetering on a recession. The charts said ‚Äúbuy,‚Äù and so we bought.\n\n### The Looming Government Shutdown That Wasn‚Äôt\n\nBut, of course, let‚Äôs not ignore the real savior of the markets‚ÄîCongress. Yes, that beacon of efficiency and bipartisanship that we all trust so much. The threat of a government shutdown was enough to send shivers down the spine of investors everywhere. But in a twist that shocked absolutely no one, Congress avoided it. Sort of. For now.\n\nNow, I know what you‚Äôre thinking: ‚ÄúHow could avoiding a shutdown actually cause the market to bottom?‚Äù Simple. When faced with the threat of government incompetence grinding the economy to a halt, investors suddenly remembered that Congress has a long and storied history of kicking the can down the road. There was never any real risk! They were going to do what they do best: wait until the absolute last minute and then barely pass something to keep the lights on for a few more weeks. Markets love that kind of predictability.\n\nAnd here‚Äôs the kicker: the more dysfunction in Washington, the more the market loves it. Why? Because the less Congress does, the less they interfere with the glorious workings of capitalism. So naturally, as soon as they did just enough to avoid a shutdown, the markets breathed a sigh of relief and bottomed out.\n\n### The Ever-Present ‚ÄúWall of Worry‚Äù\n\nAh yes, the ‚Äúwall of worry.‚Äù The thing that markets *love* to climb. Inflation? Worry. Rising interest rates? Worry. Recession fears? Worry. An energy crisis brewing in Europe? Worry. The wall of worry is higher than ever, but here‚Äôs the thing about markets‚Äîthey don‚Äôt care. In fact, they thrive on this stuff.\n\nSee, when everyone‚Äôs worried, it means the market is ‚Äúclimbing‚Äù that wall. And nothing says bullish like a good old-fashioned sense of impending doom, right? When retail investors are freaking out about their 401(k)s, that‚Äôs when the real pros come in and scoop up the deals. Because, as every investor knows, there‚Äôs nothing more bullish than a market that looks like it‚Äôs about to collapse. \n\n### Why Meta Will Hit $600 by 11/11 (Yes, Really)\n\nNow, let‚Äôs talk Meta. Why $600 by November 11? Is it based on any fundamental analysis of the company‚Äôs earnings, growth prospects, or Zuckerberg‚Äôs grand metaverse ambitions? Of course not! It‚Äôs based on the fact that everyone *wants* it to hit $600. And if we‚Äôve learned anything from the past few years, it‚Äôs that what retail investors want, they get.\n\nYou see, Meta‚Äôs been climbing its own wall of worry. People said the metaverse was a pipe dream, that Meta was spending too much, and that their ad revenue was doomed. But just like the market on Friday, Meta is bottoming. Why? Because technical factors said so. And also because if you throw enough money at virtual reality, eventually something has to stick, right?\n\nSo buckle up, dear readers. We‚Äôre in for a ride. The market has bottomed, the wall of worry is crumbling, and Meta is on a collision course with $600 by 11/11. Why? Because it‚Äôs 2024, and that‚Äôs just how things work now. \n\nDon't fight the technicals!\n\nPOSITIONS: META 160C 12/20/24", "id": "1fbgpyh", "created_utc": 1725741814.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.43, "num_comments": 78, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 1 | **First Seen In WSB** | 3 years ago\n**Total Comments** | 313 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 4 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Another leg down confirmed", "score": 84, "replies": [{"body": "That long ass post just so he could convince himself his META calls aren‚Äôt screwed üòÇ", "score": 25, "replies": []}, {"body": "Ya, the only bottom here is OP.", "score": 13, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "no charts, no links, no positions\n\nban this motherfucker", "score": 123, "replies": [{"body": "Trust me, bro", "score": 21, "replies": []}, {"body": "OP bottoms every Friday.", "score": 16, "replies": []}, {"body": "We demand crayons üñçÔ∏è !!", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Fr, I need crayons and if ima read something.", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "He does have a single line mention of his positions but I do prefer a nice screenshot", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "pretty sure that was a later edit\n\nbut its something", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Too long to read.
