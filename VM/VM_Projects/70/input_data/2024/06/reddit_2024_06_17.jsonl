The stock price is usually the most important, but IV can also impact the price, and Theta decay will always be working against long options. \n\n\\[Does the price to purchase the option rise if you wait longer to purchase? Closer to the expiration date?\\] If the stock continues to move in the right direction, then it may help to hold to make more profit, but this also gives the stock more time to move against the option that can lose some or all of the profit. \n\nThe best answer for when to close is to establish profit and loss target amounts before opening the trade and then close once one of these is met. This would lock in a profit if closed when it hit the profit amount, and limit losses if closed at the loss amount. The goal is to have many more profits than losses to have a positive annual return. How to determine these closing amounts requires experience and involves such things as the strength of the stock prediction, personal risk tolerance, and using data from many prior trades of how well the trading plan is working.\n\n\\[Also I don’t understand the bid and ask. What do the decimal numbers mean?\\]\n\nThe Bid-Ask spread can be used as \"shorthand\" for options liquidity. Not all stocks will have liquid options which are necessary to effective options trading. A narrow Bid-Ask spread usually indicates a liquid option that can be easily traded to get in and out at a good price. \n\nSee this on what Illiquid options mean - [Illiquid Option: Meaning, Overview, Disadvantages (investopedia.com)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/illiquid_option.asp) \n\nBid-Ask is shown here - [Bid and Ask Definition, How Prices Are Determined, and Example (investopedia.com)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bid-and-ask.asp) \n\nThis thread has a host of links above that cover just about anything you would need to know but expect it will take weeks or months to gain a fuller understanding. Paper trading can be very helpful to see how things work before risking any real money. \n\nAs you do gain an understanding then something you will need to do is develop a trading plan that spells out how to determine trades, when to open, profit and loss targets, how to manage risk, and what to do if a trade gets challenged. Many new traders do not make a plan and \"guess\" or trade on \"feel\" which causes losses and frustration, but those who have a well thought out and robust trading plan will have a much higher chance of success . . .", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "A good starting analogy is property insurance. You buy insurance for your car and for your house. You pay a premium for the insurance contract. If you need to make a claim to recoup a property loss, the insurance company pays you cash, even if the amount they pay is more than the total premium you paid the company. If you don't make a claim, the insurance company keeps your premium.\n\nInsurance companies make a profit when the total claims they have to pay is less than their net income from premiums.\n\nOption contracts work the same way, only instead of protecting property, they protect the buyer from losses on their investments. For example, if you have 100+ shares you that you bought at $50/share and now they are worth $75/share and you want to protect some of your gains from losses, you might decide to buy insurance for $5/share in the form of a protective put. You set the strike of the put at the share price you want to stop losing money at. For example, say you want to stop losing money at $65/share. You spent $5/share for the put, so you are basically saying you don't want to lose more than $10/share of the gains total. If the share price falls below $65, the put starts gaining intrinsic value (it probably started to gain time value before that, since the stock would betrending down). Once the put reaches 1.0 delta, it will gain a dollar for every dollar of share price lost.\n\nIf the stock never goes down, you lose the $5/share premium you paid, just like in the insurance case when you don't make a claim.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Hi guys, I tried out options and bough a contract.

Or if I really think the loss is temporary I might hold, but that is a violation of my own trading discipline and I've been burned by doing that before. If you don't like the max loss the spread offers, narrow your spreads.

Your trade is most likely taken by a [market maker.](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketmaker.asp)  You may have heard of market makers; they exist in the stock markets (as well as other securities markets) too.  They are financial professionals whose job is to make the market by taking the other end of trades.  If, in order to buy from you, they wind up with one more long call, they hedge their position by selling shares of the underlying to remain delta-neutral (i.e., keep a net position delta of 0.)  They neither make nor lose money on the option itself; they break even on it, and make their money off the bid-ask spread (they can buy lower, and sell higher, than you can.)\n\nIf you don't know what delta means, read up on how options pricing works and the greeks.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Got ya, so just to confirm, there are individuals or in some cases market makers, who are buying these close to expiration contracts from me, and not making any profit on it?

Wait. If you are buying, they are long options by definition, so why the redundancy? Did you maybe mean far-dated options? \"Long\" means a debit trade, buy to open, in options parlance. Because long has a reserved meaning, we use near- and far-dated for expiration timing.\n\nEven if you meant far-dated, there are posts about people buying LEAPS calls on this sub every single day.

It's like when you hear about house buyers in a very hot real estate market, \"offering $20k over asking.\" That's similar to a situation where IV is relatively high. People want the call so much that they are willing to pay extra for it.\n\n**Delta**: How much money the put or or call will make for you if you guess the direction correctly. Higher delta means you make more (in dollars) for every $1 of price the stock moves than you would for a lower delta.\n\n**Vega**: How much IV crush will hurt you. Higher vega hurts you more.\n\n**Theta**: How much time value you lose the longer you hold the put or call. Holding a high theta for 10 days will lose more than holding low theta for 10 days. But holding $.01 theta for 100 days is the same as holding $1.00 theta for one day. Theta is the cost of gamma.\n\n**Gamma**: How quickly a loser turns into a winner, or a winner turns into a loser, on expiration day (0 DTE) per $1 move of the stock. Alternatively: Gamma is the cost of theta.\n\n>isn’t 0dte technically gambling?\n\nThe way some people trade 0 DTE, yes. So what? What's wrong with gambling?\n\n>is nvda ever hitting 200 a share?\n\nAnything is possible. It was several times over $200 before the split.

IMO buying requires getting the stock direction and timing correct or they lose. Theta decay works against long (bought) options, and they are inefficient to roll or manage. \n\nSelling options may still profit even if the stock direction is not correct, Theta decay helps them profit and they can be easily rolled out in time to collect more premiums that can help improve the win rate, make a higher profit or reduce the max loss amount.\n\nIMO and based on the above selling options has a higher win rate and is why many experienced traders gravitate to selling. See r/thetagang where most who post there are options sellers. Again, IMO buying options in general is more of a \"gamble\" since the stock has to move in the right direction by a certain amount and in a specific time to profit. Since the stocks will not always cooperate these tend to lose a lot more often. \n\nI'll keep this next part high level and expect to have the pedantic and persnickety here on reddit come in with corrections . . .  \n\nIV is the calculated predicted \"implied\" move of the stock and a higher IV results in larger options premiums with lower IV offering lower premiums. Options sellers who \"sell high and buy back low\" to profit often look for high IV to collect more premiums and try to make more profit. Low IV means options can be bought for a lower price and sold for a higher price if the IV moves up. \n\nThe Greeks are complicated and are like the gauges on your car each telling you something. I'll post a link for Delta which has one use as estimating the probability of the option expiring ITM or OTM.

All investments and trading have some risk based on the unknown of what the stock will do. 0DTE becomes more like gambling in the sense that losses can occur quickly and there is less time or ability to make adjustments if a trade goes wrong. \n\nNo one can tell what any stock will do with any level of certainty, but using Delta we can estimate the probability of NVDA being at or above $200 by 16Aug to be about 3%.
