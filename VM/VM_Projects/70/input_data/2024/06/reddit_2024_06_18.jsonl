{"title": "ARM is crazy overvalued‚Ä¶ does it matter?", "selftext": "I have ARM in one of my watchlists, and I see it often. Lately, I have only seen green. In fact, the stock is up almost exactly 100% since its low of $87 on April 19. However, it took me about 5 minutes to realize just how overvalued the company is.\n\nFirst of all, it is currently sitting at a market cap of 182 billion dollars. When you look closer, you will see that the company had normalized net income of $395 million dollars in 2023. You read that right. 395 million. Total 2023 revenue was just 2.6 billion. It has a P/E of 600+. These are shocking numbers for a company with that high of a market cap.\n\nARM is riding on the AI wave, obviously. Nvidia is on a meteoric rise, and any company that mentions AI sees their stock prices skyrocket. However, ARM‚Äôs entire business model is royalties. They created the ARM computer chip architecture in 1985, which is far more efficient than Intel‚Äôs x86. ARM architecture is used in almost every mobile device, and lately, many computer chips in laptops and desktops (All of Apple‚Äôs chips use ARM). This all sounds great for ARM, until you realize that they don‚Äôt design these chips, nor do they build them. They are simply benefitting from the recent AI hype.\n\nDon‚Äôt be fooled however‚Ä¶ with the way the market is behaving, this stock could run up much further than any of us expect. I wanted to insult some of the analysts that are continuing to recommend buys and increasing PO‚Äôs, but they probably know it will continue to rise despite these fundamentals.
