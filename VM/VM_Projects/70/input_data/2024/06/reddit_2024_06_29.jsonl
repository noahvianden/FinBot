I'm pretty new to trading, and have been screwed more than once by pre market and opening gap ups/downs. What's the right way to approach the pre market movement, and the first 30 minutes of frenzy when the market opens? It often seems that when I expect the trend to follow, it reverses when things stabilise at 10am.

Only get in if you can stomach the risk.  By this point a lot of the high speed traders are basically done with their day having blown through their margin or hitting their profit targets.\n\n10:30-12:00 - Confirmation or Retrace - 10am data comes in, if an overbought/oversold condition comes in, thereâ€™s usually a switch in direction as long as volume remains low. Key here is watching volume.\n\n12:00-2:00 - Steady support - Bond auctions finish up at 1ish.  Usually lower volume and supports the general market sentiment for the day.\n\n2:00-3:00 - Retrace - Usually a short reversal to trim RSI or a pause for consolidation. Volume tends to be low.\n\n3:00-3:30 - False finish - Volatlity, high speed, day traders all start to step back in looking for deals.\n\n3:30-4:15 - Chaos to the finish line - Brokerage auto close options, and bets during earnings season kick in for the finish.  I say 4:15 as there are late close options like SPY and QQQ that provide material support and volatility until that time.\n\nOn data days, the direction is pretty much set if the data comes in as expected.
