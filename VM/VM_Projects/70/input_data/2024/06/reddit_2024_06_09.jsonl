{"title": "Apple's (AAPL) Rollercoaster: Should You Jump In Now?", "selftext": "If you‚Äôve been keeping an eye on Apple (AAPL), you know it‚Äôs been a wild ride lately. The stock took a beating in the first four months of 2024, dropping 8% while the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index climbed 6%. Why? Stagnant growth and a DOJ lawsuit knocked investor confidence. But then May came along, and Apple bounced back with a 12% surge thanks to strong Q2 results for fiscal 2024, announced on May 2.\n\n**Quick Stats**\n\n* **Current Price:** $196.89 (+1.24%)\n* **Market Cap:** $3,019B\n* **52-Week Range:** $164.07 - $199.62\n* **Volume:** 53M (Avg: 60M)\n\n**What's Driving the Turnaround?**\n\nApple‚Äôs revenue for Q2 2024 dipped 4% year-over-year to $90.8 billion, mainly because iPhone sales fell to $46 billion from $51.3 billion last year. But here‚Äôs the kicker: Apple‚Äôs earnings per share nudged up to $1.53, beating the $1.50 expectation. The services sector is where Apple shone, raking in a record $23.9 billion, up 14% year-over-year. This area is a goldmine for Apple, bolstering its bottom line even when hardware sales lag.\n\nLooking ahead, Apple expects revenue to pick up in the current quarter, driven by services and a bounce back in iPad sales. Given that iPhones contribute to half of Apple‚Äôs revenue, any uptick in smartphone sales will be a big win. The global smartphone market is on a comeback, with 7.8% growth in Q1 2024, according to IDC, and AI-enabled smartphones could be a game changer this year.\n\n**AI: The Next Big Catalyst**\n\nApple‚Äôs rumored to be diving into the AI smartphone market with iOS 18. Features like AI-powered transcripts, message summaries, and even a smarter Siri could debut soon. AI enhancements are expected to drive another upgrade cycle, and with Apple holding a 17% share in the smartphone market, this could be huge.\n\n**Should You Buy In?**\n\nAnalysts are bullish. Wedbush Securities sees Apple‚Äôs AI-enabled iPhones kicking off a major upgrade cycle, upping their price target to $275 from $250‚Äîa potential 45% gain from current levels. The median 12-month price target is $202, suggesting a 6% upside.\n\nHere‚Äôs the play: Apple‚Äôs trading at 29 times trailing earnings, which is a discount compared to the Nasdaq-100‚Äôs 31 times. With analysts revising their earnings expectations upwards and AI developments on the horizon, this might be the moment to get in before Apple starts another run.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n\n1. **Buy Zone:** Under $195, if you‚Äôre looking for a solid entry.\n2. **Sell Targets:** Short-term around $202; long-term riding the wave towards $275.\n3. **Watch List:** Keep an eye on AI updates and quarterly earnings for quick reaction opportunities.\n\n", "id": "1dc780c", "created_utc": 1717975081.0, "score": 197, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 79, "comments": [{"body": "I bought \\~100 shares when it was hovering in the high 160s a couple months ago.
