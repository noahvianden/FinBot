{"title": "NVDA is getting several bullish calls from the Wall Street ", "selftext": "Messed up the title, but anyways. I'm in this till the end baby. NVDA is receiving positive attention from Wall Street, with Bank of America adding it to its US 1 List, highlighting top investment ideas. Recent product announcements and future plans at Computex showcase Nvidia's growth potential, particularly with its new AI architecture Rubin (R100) and powerful H100 and Blackwell chips outperforming competitors. Nvidia will begin shipping the H200 chip in the latter half of the year and introduced new accelerators (B200, GB200, GB200 NVL72) at its GTC conference. These developments support Nvidia's high P/E multiple of 71, justified by expected growth rates of over 100% this year and 32% next year. Nvidia's forward P/E multiple based on 2026 EPS estimates is 35.74, making the stock's valuation attractive given its growth prospects.

For Meta, this would be a zero to one hardware innovation that potentially every person on the planet could begin to use.
