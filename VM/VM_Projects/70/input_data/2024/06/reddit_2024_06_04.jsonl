Higher unrealized losses on residential mortgage-backed securities, resulting from higher mortgage rates in the first quarter, drove the overall increase. This is the ninth straight quarter of unusually high unrealized losses since the Federal Reserve began to raise interest rates in first quarter 2022.”* \n\nThe FDIC also says that the number of lenders on its Problem Bank List rose last quarter. According to the agency, these banks are on the brink of insolvency due to financial, operational, or managerial weakness or a combination of such issues.\n\n*“The number of banks on the Problem Bank List, those with a CAMELS composite rating of ‘4’ or ‘5’ increased from* ***52 in fourth quarter 2023 to 63 in first quarter 2024****. The number of problem banks represented 1.4% of total banks, which was within the normal range for non-crisis periods of 1% to 2% of all banks.*  ***Total assets held by problem banks increased $15.8 billion to $82.1 billion during the quarter.”*** \n\nWhile the FDIC says that the health of the US banking system is **at no imminent risk**, it warns that persistent inflation, volatile market rates and geopolitical concerns continue to put pressure on the industry.\n\n*“These issues could cause credit quality, earnings, and liquidity challenges for the industry. In addition, deterioration in certain loan portfolios, particularly office properties and credit card loans, continues to warrant monitoring. These issues, together with funding and margin pressures, will remain matters of ongoing supervisory attention by the FDIC.”* ", "id": "1d7oro1", "created_utc": 1717475909.0, "score": 196, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "num_comments": 89, "comments": [{"body": "> The number of problem banks represented 1.4% of total banks, which was within the normal range for non-crisis periods of 1% to 2% of all banks.   \n   \nSounds like something is a bit overblown.", "score": 249, "replies": []}, {"body": "Lots of small unlisted banks in the US.  \n\n1.4% of the multi trillion banking sector is basically irrelevant. \n\nPosts like this make me think bank stock shorts are looking to cover.

In many cases they’re going to be held-to-maturity securities where the bank has no intent to sell them and has made plans around that.  The entire banking system has over $20 trillion dollars in assets.\n\nIf I were going to look for banks to bet against, I’d be searching for ones that also had a weak capital position and poor liquidity, because those are the situations where they might have to realize losses and might not have the equity to cover it.

Based on their \"troubled banks'\" COMBINED assets of $83B (compared to a single top-tier bank, which holds >$250B), these are almost universally smaller community banks. \n\nThe fear-mongering aspect of this report takes two relatively unrelated data points and puts them in the same sentence to make it sound like we're on the brink of erasing $500B of value from the market.\n\nWhat they're really saying here is that banks have extended a ton of loans to homebuyers.  When the interest rates went up again last quarter, it makes buying a house less attractive, so (generally speaking), the market price falls a bit.  Makes sense: a $300K house at 5% seems like a better buy than a $300K house at 7%, so people buying homes might want to only pay $285K for that same house now.  That's why unrealized losses spiked in 2022, when we started to raise interest rates to combat inflation.\n\nSince the estimated \"market value\" for the homes dropped in response to higher interest rates, and since the banks hold the title for the home, it counts as an unrealized loss. \"We (PNC Bank), extended a $400K loan to Jack Smith to buy this home, valued at $425K.  Now, with higher interest rates, we'd be lucky to sell that house for $350K if we had to.  So we're sitting on a -$75K liability (350 minus 425).\" (I'm not a banker, so they might count is as a $50K liability based on their investment).  That times thousands of homes is the net unrealized loss.  It won't affect the banks operations as long as Jack keeps paying his mortgage.  Let's say a bunch of people get laid off suddently and can't afford their homes, and the bank seizes ownership of thousands of homes....  Now if the banks try to sell all these homes in a flooded market, prices will plummet, banks lose a ton of money.  \n\nThen the banks (who were libertarian, anti-government and capitalist while things were good), will suddenly turn socialist and beg the government to bail them out because \"our bank failing will decimate the economy so you HAVE to help us!\"  Privatize the gains, socialize the losses.", "score": 0, "replies": []}, {"body": "“It is within our model” FDIC … where have I heard this before????
