Now, you‚Äôre sitting on a gold mine, and you're wondering if you should cash out or let it ride.\n\nOption 1: Sell now and lock in those tendies. Sure, you'll have to pay taxes, but think of the gains you can flex on your fellow apes. \"Oh, what's that? You YOLO'd on GME? That's cute. I just cashed out on Apple calls.\"\n\nOption 2: Hold until after New Year's. Delaying taxes? Very smooth-brain move. Let's just hope Tim Cook doesn't decide to pull a fast one and announce that Apple's transitioning to making banana phones in January. But hey, what's a little risk, right? We're all about that high-risk, high-reward life.\n\nAnd then there's Option 3: Hold until expiration. Because why not go full Chad? You've got six months left for Apple to launch iCar, iHouse, and iPlanet. Who knows, maybe Apple will buy Tesla and Elon will take us to Mars. Sky's the limit.\n\nSo, what do you do? Flip a coin, consult the magic 8-ball, or just trust your gut. After all, this is Wall Street Bets.
