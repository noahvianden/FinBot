Theta only outperforms in flat markets. \n\nAs markets and stock prices are always dynamically changing, rather than statically stable, is not common that markets stay flat for long periods of time. To do theta in the long run is a losing strategy. \n\nThe better way to think of theta trades is that you are utilizing trades for entering (selling covered puts) or exiting (selling covered calls) positions in a lukewarm manner that spreads out risk. For example, if you‚Äôve got the cash and want to gradually enter/exit a position 100 shares at a time because your conviction is low, theta is a great way to do so and lower the risk of such an event happening, then combine with buying/selling the shares when your conviction is high.

If you sell covered calls or covered puts and the underlying tanks, then you kick yourself for not getting off the boat before it sank.\n\nTo illustrate my belief that theta trades are best used in a combined strategy of entering or exiting a position, here are two scenarios:\n* Bull thesis: You own 0 shares of the underlying. Buy 100 shares. Sell a covered put to potentially acquire more shares. Buy another 100 shares if the underlying begins to rally, getting a discount from the covered put premium. You end up with 200 or 300 shares at expiry.\n* Bear thesis: You already own 300 shares of the underlying. Sell 100 shares. Sell a covered call to potentially sell more shares.
