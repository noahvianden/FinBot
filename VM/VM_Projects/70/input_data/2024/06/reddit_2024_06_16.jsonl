{"title": "SoFi: Overhyped or Underhyped?", "selftext": "Everyone knows the story. A one stop shop for all your financial needs, the Apple of finance, the AWS of fintech... but the stock has not moved in over a year and is down 38% since its IPO. Probably mostly due to being overhyped at first, the macro uncertainty at the moment and the thought that this \\*bank\\* has not been tested on a real difficult macro environment. I probably wont say anything new existing bulls don't already know though, as the stock is cultish and has a very loyal following\n\nHowever, in recent months, due to the constant negative stock price action there has been a real increase in negative sentiment on social media, with people saying that they are capitulating or are desperate to sell at the next uptick, and sofi bulls are being trashed all over social media, with bears being increasingly vocal as well. This increased so much so that even on SoFi Stock subreddit the mods said that they started letting more and more posts and comments straight up trashing the stock through, in part due to their large volume I believe.\n\nTrading/investing on sentiment alone is never a good idea, \\*unless\\* the sentiment is trending in the opposite direction of the fundamentals. What's more, although insiders are net sellers atm, the CEO keeps buying the stock on every single dip, and institutional ownership has increased from around 32% to over 41% over the past year.\n\nWhy do I believe the fundamentals are trading in the opposite direction?\n\n1. SoFi is valued like a moderately fast growing bank even though their pace of growth in margins and earnings for now is that of a tech company.\n   * Their current P/B value (used to value banks) sits at around 1.17, with an all time high of 4.32 and low of 0,78, while JP Morgan is currently valued at 1.82. To be fair, JP Morgan's growth in book value per share has been 13.2% over the past 12 months, while SoFi's has been -0.9%, due to dilution.\n   * Despite this, management has been determined to lower SBC as the company matures, and at the moment are in growth mode, focused on scaling their multiple business segments to make up 33% of their revenue each, this includes: Lending (currently significantly overweight in terms of revenue share), Financial Services, Tech Platform.\n2. The current growth rate projected by management takes into account extremely conservative assumptions:\n   * Lending is set to grow around 0% percent this year, as is management's conscious decision, reflecting an uncertain macro environment, with that rate having the potential to explode once default rates stabilize and projections are more clear.\n   * Financial services are currently growing by more than 70% each year and are expected to grow by at least 50% every year for the next few years.\n   * Tech platform is set to grow by at least 20% Y/Y. \n   * All of these rates assume no new product launches or \"unexpected\" sources of revenue. However, management has hinted that they are in talks with multiple top financial institutions about tech platform implementation, with \"a top 5 US bank\" having tested a proof of concept. This platform would help the banks switch from their old legacy software to one that is a lot more robust and able to accommodate modern online banking needs, as well as having people who actually know the coding language and so can help if any technical difficulties arise. Thing is, galileo is based in part on infrastructure-as-a-service model that allows SoFi to generate revenue based on their clients' size, for example generating a small profit every time a transaction is made on one of their clients' platforms. Having a large bank as their client would significantly accelerate their growth rate.\n3. They turned profitable this year, and EPS growth is expected to continue, but not everyone is convinced.\n   * They expect to grow from projected 0,08 in 2024 c to at least 0.50 to 0.80 c by 2026, which if done and continued would significantly aid in growing book value, if not demand a higher multiple, currently being at around 81 FWD PE (2024), but 13 FWD PE (2026).\n   * The analysts and financial institutions are sceptical about this growth rate, and this is in part where the opportunity lies. The growth targets have been called \"aspirational\", and the first quarter that SoFi turned profitable, one analyst basically asked if they were rigging numbers.\n   * There has also been some controversy surrounding their accounting, as they are using a method that assumes they would sell their loans rather than hold them to maturity, and the scepticism was that they would fail to sell due to reducing demand which would force them to account for higher losses on their balance sheet. However, they have demonstrated that even their unsecured loans are of the highest quality (FICO scores more than 750), and trusted by the market, by selling a significant number of their loans last quarter.\n4. People are mostly happy with the product, SoFi is well rated, and their deposits are insured up to 2 mil due to the banking license, so customers probably feel their money is safe as well. They are dilligent with their product launches, the CEO has hinted that they were slow with Zelle implementation for example to ensure customers' security. Crypto has currently been discontinued, but the talks are ongoing with regulators, and with all the recent product launches, such as the crypto ETFs, it may come back at some point.\n5. The management seems nimble, with Anthony Noto at the forefront, having kept up their growth rates despite losing their largest business segment (Student loans) a few years back, having completely transformed the business, and now focusing on improving other segments rather than unsecured loans when the default rates are still rising, this makes me trust their guidance a little more.\n\nInvesting in this company requires trusting that the managements' projections are honest and potentially conservative, and that they are able to execute, which they currently have a history of doing. There is a lot of mistrust in the market, however, which may be founded, but just seems overdone at the moment.\n\nThe bet would be that they sign up a large client within the next few quarters and significantly raise their guidance, which could make current price seem like peanuts.\n\nBecause of these reasons, I believe SoFi may currently be Underhyped.", "id": "1dhbykv", "created_utc": 1718557133.0, "score": 55, "upvote_ratio": 0.76, "num_comments": 83, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 1 | **First Seen In WSB** | 3 years ago\n**Total Comments** | 9 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 3 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Seasoned veteran SOFI bag holder here.
