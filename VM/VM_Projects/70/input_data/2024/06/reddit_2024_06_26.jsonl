{"title": "Tesla Stock Price will go down over the next six months?", "selftext": "Looking into Tesla, I am predicting that over the next couple of months the price Tesla stock will go down due to multiple factors. I would like to share my thoughts and see what you guys are thinking. \n\n1. Twitter/X is dead weight: It has been said elsewhere before but it is worth repeating that Elon buying Twitter was a mistake for everyone involved. Twitter was already an unprofitable company well before Elon took over, and his decisions have scarred off a lot of advertisers in having the space be less moderated (not to touch on the issue of how Elon being the face of Tesla has in voicing controversial opinions has made both other companies less willing to work with him as well as tarnished his image to much of the general public). It does not help Elon in any way to keep this website operating.\n\n2. Cybertruck: The resources used to produce the Cybertruck were resources that could have been used to produce EVs that people wanted and were already buying, and or produce a next generation of electric vehicles for the general public. Less than 4,000 Cybertrucks have been sold since April and there have already been 4 recalls for the car.  \n\n3. Tesla is facing increased competition both in places like the US as well as in China, and thus has to start a price war with a country known for selling very cheap goods.\n\nNow. I am not saying that Tesla is doomed or that there will be a massive stock crash. But that in the next months the growth that Tesla will reverse as Tesla faces more competition, more controversy and especially with Twitter acting as an Albatross around Elon‚Äôs neck. What you are seeing now with the price increase over the last month could be some sort of short selling scheme to get people to buy Tesla Stock before it starts to come tumbling down.\n\nThoughts?
