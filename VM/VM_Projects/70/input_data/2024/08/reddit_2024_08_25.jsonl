Nvidia is cooking the books and inflate the demand to increase their chip prices...\n\n  \nWait a minute, there is another strange thing in the tables above. In the latest results, #NVIDIA declares:\n\n* 18.8bn$ of future inventory commitments\n* 10.6bn$ of future non-inventory commitments\n* TOTAL 29.4bn$\n\nThis means that #NVIDIA increased the orders with its suppliers to produce GPUs only by 16.7% while total “future commitments” increased by 42%. What about inventory orders compared to one year ago? They grew from 7.24bn$ to 18.8bn$ or TWO-HUNDRED AND FIFTY-NINE PERCENT\n\nWait a minute, by how much did #NVIDIA’s “Computer and Networking” revenues grow over the past year? 404%…\n\nBasically, #NVIDIA pretends us to believe that:\n\n* Its clients purchase in big sizes never asking for a discount (and do not forget \\~50% of the total revenues come from just 4 names: Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Meta)\n* Its suppliers continue producing at the same costs over the years despite the “boom” in order\n\nSo clearly the laws of demand and supply do not apply to #NVIDIA unless… the company keeps rebates to clients and production costs increases by its suppliers off-the-book to keep showcasing unrealistic margins in the same way they did, and got fined for, in the aftermath of the dotcom bust: [NVIDIA CURRENTLY EMPLOYING THE SAME ACCOUNTING TRICK TO INFLATE ITS MARGINS IT WAS PREVIOUSLY CAUGHT USING DURING THE DOT-COM BUBBLE?](https://justdario.com/2024/02/is-nvda-currently-employing-the-same-accounting-trick-to-inflate-its-margins-it-was-previously-caught-using-during-the-dot-com-bubble/)\n\nAs if the above I described was not already enough, we already know:\n\n* NVIDIA is inflating its sales via client financing. In some very peculiar situations, Nvidia is even a significant shareholder of them, like in the case of Coreweave: [NVIDIA (PONZI) “LIES” UNDER NVIDIA NOSE](https://justdario.com/2023/11/nvda-ponzi-lies-under-nvda-nose/)\n* NVIDIA is gamma-squeezing its own stock: [NVIDIA – THE (FRAUD) SMOKING GUN?](https://justdario.com/2024/02/nvidia-the-fraud-smoking-gun/)\n\nAt this point, I believe there is no more doubt that #NVIDIA is only one piece of a bigger fraudulent puzzle.\n\n1- #NVIDIA invests in [#Coreweave](https://justdario.com/tag/coreweave/)\n\n2- #Coreweave buys (overpriced) #NVIDIA GPUs.\n\n3- #Coreweave raises financing using #NVIDIA GPUs as collateral. What do they do with that? They buy more #NVIDIA GPUs, of course…\n\n4- Meanwhile #Microsoft signs a deal with #Coreweave worth “billions” for future use of a cloud infrastructure #Coreweave didn’t even begin to build yet while #Microsoft is, at the same time, loading on #NVIDIA GPUs for Azure that technically is a #Coreweave competitor?!\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2nnbakkj1skd1.png?width=1008&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b13264c669c02b6257de7934fb9c85a65c40e86", "id": "1f0s1zq", "created_utc": 1724576253.0, "score": 17, "upvote_ratio": 0.57, "num_comments": 86, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 1 | **First Seen In WSB** | 2 weeks ago\n**Total Comments** | 3 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 1 year | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "!remind me in 4 days", "score": 48, "replies": [{"body": "I will be messaging you in 4 days on [**2024-08-29 09:32:57 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2024-08-29%2009:32:57%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) to remind you of [**this link**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1f0s1zq/shorting_nvida_25x_leverage/lju1lll/?context=3)\n\n[**35 OTHERS CLICKED THIS LINK**](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Reminder&message=%5Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2Fwallstreetbets%2Fcomments%2F1f0s1zq%2Fshorting_nvida_25x_leverage%2Flju1lll%2F%5D%0A%0ARemindMe%21%202024-08-29%2009%3A32%3A57%20UTC) to send a PM to also be reminded and to reduce spam.\n\n^(Parent commenter can ) [^(delete this message to hide from others.)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Delete%20Comment&message=Delete%21%201f0s1zq)\n\n*****\n\n|[^(Info)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RemindMeBot/comments/e1bko7/remindmebot_info_v21/)|[^(Custom)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Reminder&message=%5BLink%20or%20message%20inside%20square%20brackets%5D%0A%0ARemindMe%21%20Time%20period%20here)|[^(Your Reminders)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=List%20Of%20Reminders&message=MyReminders%21)|[^(Feedback)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=Watchful1&subject=RemindMeBot%20Feedback)|\n|-|-|-|-|", "score": 7, "replies": []}, {"body": "!remind me in 4 days", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Alright now get me my fries Im already late.", "score": 43, "replies": [{"body": "I’ve been sitting in this line for 3 hours, all I see is workers running out the back door with mayonnaise around their lips.

Even if OP is wrong about his own theories.\n\nTheir ridiculous pricing and revenue is driven by the fact that everyone is clambering to build their AI capabilities and only Nvidia offers what they need currently, and Nvidia is practically price gouging as a result. This won't last forever as competition increases (and they dont have to match Nvidia's capabilities to start taking market share) and companies slow their AI spend as their infrastructure is built and their scope better defined/met. That will *eventually* massively impact Nvidia's pricing power and volume, and therefore revenue and margins. \n\nAnd that's just the obvious risks, let alone black swan events (like if OP is right with his theory). It's a question of when, not if. You're delusional if you think otherwise, quite frankly. The hedge funds/asset managers who own Nvidia absolutely know this too, and when Nvidia does start to turn they'll be very quick to dump and leave retail holding the bag. But until there's a sign of the inevitable starting to play out, Nvidia stock will probably continue to perform well, so there's no way I'd be shorting.
