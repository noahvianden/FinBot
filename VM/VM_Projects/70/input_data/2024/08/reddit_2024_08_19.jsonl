Company I work for will never use ARM laptops, I am absolutely sure about it. It would require supporting tools for two architectures for absolutely no gain whatsoever.

Battery life is great and the high performance for office related apps are the most important. I see your point in many Windows user also using prof software that is currently not running on ARM.
