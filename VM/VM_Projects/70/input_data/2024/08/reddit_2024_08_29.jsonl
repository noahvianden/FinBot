Hopefully it‚Äôs lesson well learned (paid). \n\nI enjoy buying options! They‚Äôre gonna be a lot of clowns here that are against option simply cuz they‚Äôre low IQ investors and don‚Äôt know shit except how to regurgitate ‚Äúbuy n hodl‚Äù. At the same time I don‚Äôt recommend options for the beginner or casual investors. They‚Äôre great way to maximize your investments if you‚Äôre a big believer in a company BUT they do assume more risks if you aren‚Äôt careful.\n\nAnyway, my advice‚Ä¶ \n\n1. Never buy options at earnings, ever! Unless you are ok with losing your entire investment as it‚Äôs pure gambling. No one can predict how the market will react to earnings and if someone says they can, they‚Äôre full of shit.\n\n1b. I seen enough earnings where if the entire market believes a stock is gonna perform one way, 8/9 out of 10 it‚Äôs gonna do the opposite. In this case, everyone was betting great earnings, stock will moon, and the market manipulators made sure that didn‚Äôt happen. \n\n2. As you mention, buying options at earning is bad idea due to IV crush. Pre earnings IV rises (more buyers) = higher premiums. Post earnings IV decreases (less buyers) = less value of your contracts. I‚Äôd try to buy options a couple weeks before earnings if possible. \n\n3. Regardless of when you buy options, imho you want to at least get an expiration of 45 days and shoot for 90 days or longer. As Theta (time decay) is an issue when you buy options with a short expiration. \n\n3b. Imho the better investment if you were so inclined to buying options right before earnings would have been a exp date right before or right after the next earnings in NOV. As that gives your calls (or puts) time to recover if you get a repeat of today and the market moves in the opposite direction after earnings comes out. Then pending how your options performs, you can take profits (hopefully) or roll your contracts into a new exp date. \n\nFinally, I don‚Äôt know shit and Im just a chimp like everyone else.  These are some simple rules I try to follow but obvious there are other factors for option trading. Also the bulk of my investments are still in stocks, I have a secondary account to specifically trade options. It‚Äôs more of a play account and I only fund it with bout $15-$20k. If I make money, I move it to my brokerage account and get more shares of whatever (Go ASTS/RKLB!). If I eat a big one, I sulk til I can save up enough to refund the account from my paycheck/savings. Which can take months as I need some guard rails in place where FOMO or revenge trading doesn‚Äôt consume me. \n\nFinally‚Ä¶ As for next week. No one can tell you to sell or wait. If you need the $4k then sell. If your risk tolerance is ok with losing more, then ride it out till wed/thur as I expect a rebound in the stock . However I can‚Äôt tell you if that‚Äôs next week, in a month, 2 months, etc. Good news is a lot of the options for earnings will expire tomorrow and it‚Äôs a new month so hopefully üôè stock will go up sooner as NVDA had great earnings. Again Theta will be working against next week the closer you get to Friday and Monday is a holiday BUT you already went ballz to the wallz, whats a couple more days. ü§£  \n\nGL OP, sorry for long winded post‚Ä¶ Im an old head so I don‚Äôt know how to talk in 280 characters or less‚Ä¶", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "Time decay is a real issue, it starts becoming the overriding factor as expiry gets close, I think it is as non linear correlation.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Earnings are terrible.

The stock rose more than 5% in extended trading.\n\nHere‚Äôs how the company did for the fiscal second quarter vs. LSEG consensus estimates:\n\nRevenue: $25.06 billion vs. $24.53 billion expected\n\nEPS: $1.89 adjusted, vs. $1.71 expected\n\nNet income climbed 85% to $841 million, or $1.17 per share, from $455 million, or 63 cents per share, in the year-ago period. Revenue increased about 9% from $22.93 billion a year ago.\n\nDell typically provides investors with a forecast on its analyst call. Earlier this year, the company told investors to expect revenue between $93.5 billion and $97.5 billion for the full year, up from $88.4 billion in the prior year.\n\nDell has emerged as a top vendor for servers that can handle artificial intelligence workloads, especially those based around Nvidia chips, as demand skyrockets from cloud providers. Earlier this year, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang called out Dell founder Michael Dell as the person to contact to place orders for systems that include the company‚Äôs new chips.\n\nDell shares are up 48% so far this year, but have slumped 34% since the company‚Äôs last report.\n\nAI sales are in the company‚Äôs Infrastructure Solutions Group, which makes servers and systems for data centers. It‚Äôs the company‚Äôs fastest-growing unit. Overall ISG sales rose 38% to $11.65 billion, ahead of StreetAccount expectations of $10.44 billion.\n\nThe standout in Dell‚Äôs report was Servers and Networking revenue, which includes both AI-oriented servers based around GPUs from Nvidia and AMD, as well as more traditional servers for older applications. It‚Äôs part of ISG.\n\nThe unit reported $7.76 billion in sales, rising 80% on an annual basis, and beating StreetAccount expectations of $6.37 billion. Dell said $3.1 billion of that was AI server sales, up from $1.7 billion in the May quarter.\n\nDell operating chief Jeff Clarke attributed the increase in revenue to server demand that continues to rise, and said in a statement that there was an increasing ‚Äúbacklog‚Äù of $3.8 billion in AI server orders that haven‚Äôt been fulfilled yet. There‚Äôs also a multibillion-dollar ‚Äúpipeline‚Äù of AI server deals from enterprises and cloud providers that haven‚Äôt been finalized.\n\nHowever, Dell‚Äôs storage business, also part of ISG, fell 5% to $4 billion in sales.\n\nDell‚Äôs Client Solutions Group, which focuses on PCs and laptops, declined 4% on an annual basis to $12.41 billion in revenue. Consumer sales fell 22% to $1.86 billion, and the company‚Äôs enterprise PC business was flat at $10.55 billion in sales.\n\nDell said that it spent $1 billion in the quarter on share repurchases and dividends.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/29/dell-earnings-report-q2-2025.html", "id": "1f4ccdg", "created_utc": 1724962619.0, "score": 418, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 72, "comments": [{"body": "How are the margins so bad holy.

{"title": "ASTS DD and YOLO part.2", "selftext": "\n\nI missed out on yesterday's massive drop in SMCI. If I had bought the 20240830 $400 put at the market open yesterday and sold it around noon, I could have made a 10x return in just 3 hours. Instead, my money is tied up in ASTS puts, which might take 2-4 weeks to achieve a 10x return.  \n\n\nRegarding my strategy, after posting last time and seeing everyone's replies, I realized that the 8/30 puts were a bit risky, so I sold them and moved the remaining funds into the 10/18 puts. In hindsight, switching to further-dated puts seemed like a safer choice, as I couldn't gauge how irrational people might be in pushing the stock price up, thinking that the September launch was a positive catalyst. But in the end, it appears that people were already expecting a drop after the launch date, so they started taking profits early, causing the stock price to decline. If I hadn't switched out of the 8/30 puts, I would have made more profit by now.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ywt3t1x6ukld1.png?width=1328&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b46fd97f624163aaf8c85275e13b1f6e48f6564\n\n  \nNext, I want to explain my current viewpoint and stock price prediction. I believe that within a month, the stock will drop to the $13.6-$16.6 range seen around 7/25, and within two months, it could fall to the $6.17-$9.02 range seen around 5/29.\n\nMy views are as follows:\n\n1. **Warrants causing significant equity dilution:** Regarding the warrants I mentioned last time, I regret not studying bond market theory and accounting seriously when I was pursuing my master's in financial engineering. Indeed, it's not a cash loss on the balance sheet, and if the company redeems the warrants, it will receive cash, offsetting the initial loss and increasing shareholders' equity. This is what I meant by equity dilution, though I don't know why it wasn't clearly stated in the article‚Äîprobably because I used ChatGPT to translate it (from Traditional Chinese to English), and the AI servers that train ChatGPT are manufactured by SMCI.The previously issued warrants will inevitably be exercised after the stock price has increased tenfold or twentyfold, leading to equity dilution, which will cause the stock price to drop further. The current candlestick chart looks like a falling knife. Many fools believe that the CEO's statement that there will be no new stock issuance this fiscal year means that they are safe and that equity won't be diluted. However, ASTSW has been trading all along, and convertible bonds are not new stock issuances. Based on ASTS's past methods of raising funds, issuing convertible bonds is quite common. We cannot be certain that they won't issue convertible bonds in the second half of 2024 to raise funds. Convertible bonds themselves are a potential factor for equity dilution. For instance, the convertible bonds issued in January of this year can be converted in January 2025 at a conversion price of $5.75. In other words, as long as the stock price is higher than $5.75 in January next year, it will lead to another wave of new equity dilution.\n2. **Satellite launch is a positive catalyst, but won't drive the stock price up:** I believe that the satellite launch will undoubtedly be successful, and while this is indeed a positive catalyst, often when the good news is fully priced in, the stock's downward trend begins. Moreover, after the satellite launch, whether the satellites operate normally in orbit and whether the results match the past test satellites' performance remain uncertainties, potentially causing negative impacts. Most importantly, after launching 5 satellites, are the next 20 satellites ready? Currently, there's no news, and at most, only the funding is in place. I estimate that it will take at least a year before the next batch of 20 satellites can be launched, and the stock price cannot be maintained by news of a launch happening a year later. Therefore, a pullback is inevitable. If there is news of delays in satellite production (which is not impossible for this company, given their track record), I wouldn't be surprised if the stock price drops back to $2.\n3. **Starlink, the biggest competitor, has already captured the potential satellite communication market share:** I've seen many DD (due diligence) posts claiming that ASTS is the only company offering satellite-to-phone services and that even Starlink can't achieve this capability, so ASTS will capture this entire market worth billions. They argue that Starlink might be forced to acquire ASTS at a high price to complete the satellite-to-phone service. Such foolish remarks are endless.I want to say, who do you think Elon Musk is? Do you think he can't negotiate with ECC? Not to mention, Elon Musk recently tweeted on X that he is willing to provide free emergency satellite communication services, directly nullifying ASTS's government revenue.[Link to Elon Musk's tweet](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1828527049541108055?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1828527049541108055%7Ctwgr%5E9f9eb41fa3320da12fc0420d46ed588b02d80deb%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techbang.com%2Fposts%2F117862-starlink-mobile-emergency-service)(Musk didn't even mention ASTS in his tweet, reflecting that Musk doesn't see ASTS as a competitor at all, nor as a potential acquisition target.)Therefore, when considering government contract revenue for satellite communications, remember to remove it from ASTS's projections! [Link to the Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ASTSpaceMobile/comments/1f1qsef/scotia_bank_4590_pt_upgrade_report/#lightbox) This is the Scotia Bank $45.90 PT Upgrade Report. According to this, which seems like a projection obtained after inputting a ton of cheat codes in a single-player game, \"Military, government & initial commitments as % of total sales\" is 100% for 2024E and 90% for 2025E. In other words, one tweet from Musk has almost wiped out the next two years' expected revenue.\n4. **Satellite-to-phone technology is not irreplaceable:** Continuing from the previous point, DD keeps claiming that ASTS is the only satellite-to-phone service provider and that it has over 3,700 patents, creating a wide moat... OK, using the number of patents as a measure of a moat is valid, but only if the castle inside the moat really contains gold and if others can't dig a tunnel or fly over it.The idea of satellite-to-phone service is good, but it must be used outdoors without obstruction. For those who might live in remote rural areas, if they collapse in a basement, they won't be able to send a distress signal. You still need additional equipment like Starlink's to use it indoors in remote areas. So the 3,700+ patents might be as useless as Nokia's patents for keyboard phones.\n5. **Severe overestimation of target prices by investment banks and DD:** I believe any projections beyond 18 months are for reference only, just like the packaging on instant noodles. Take NVDA, a company I consider good: you know that its current AI chip is Hopper, Blackwell will be produced in Q4, and Rubin is in development. They can only clearly plan about a year and a half ahead. The rest is just price shouting by others, with credibility akin to flipping a coin.Therefore, analysts' target prices in stock reports are based on a 12-month forecast, not now, and definitely not for the short-term stock price over the next month or two that I'm focusing on. So when I see the Scotia Bank $45.90 PT Upgrade Report, I think it's either from one of the SPACEMOBs or from someone aiming to short the stock, setting a price that SPACEMOBs cannot refuse. The report even makes detailed projections up to 2032, and all the growth rates seem as if there is only one company in the world with communication satellites, and all users have to obediently pay ASTS. It even suggests that AT&T and VZ's businesses will only consist of satellite communications, and ASTS will be able to generate an astonishing $42 billion in revenue in 2032 with just 475 satellites. If that were the case, Musk or other companies developing satellite communications should be ashamed, as they have far more than 475 satellites but have yet to generate such high revenue.Besides this ridiculously optimistic report, I've also seen some DD posts making exaggerated claims about AT&T's future service revenue, such as 50% going to AT&T and 50% to ASTS, or that the potential user base of companies currently in cooperation is 2.8 billion, with each person paying $10 per month.I want to say that AT&T has invested millions in ASTS as an advance payment for services. In other words, ASTS has already received its revenue until 2030 from AT&T. It remains to be seen whether additional service revenue from other companies will be reflected in financial reports.Calculating revenue based on a potential user base of 2.8 billion is also extremely unreasonable. For me, in my country, other than walking into a basement, the number of times I've been in a place without cell signal in a year is zero, so I probably won't be an ASTS user. I also can't use ASTS to watch YouTube videos via its 5G signal, as my current internet speed is already 500 Mbps. By the time ASTS starts offering broadband services, my ISP might already be offering 6G, with speeds of up to 10 Gbps.\n\nSo who would really need ASTS's broadband services except for outdoor emergency situations?
