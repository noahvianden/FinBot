Both are going to be readily available in Q4/Q1 2025. At current prices, both AMD and Intel beat Nvidia when it comes to total cost of ownership ( = cost of hardware + cost of operating it). Hyperscallers will look at throughput/TCO metric. 10 years ago they started scoffing at 10000$ CPUs from Intel and started developing their own solutions. Remember that Google already has one which is going soon to be at 5th gen that is sufficiently competitive and Apple sent a clear signal to the market that they did not used Nvidia, but trained everything on Google accelerators.

That's why I said, none of them needs to be better than Nvidia, they only have to be cheaper.
