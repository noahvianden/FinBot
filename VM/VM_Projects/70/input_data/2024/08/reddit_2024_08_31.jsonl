{"title": "How to avoid losing money on NVDA with stocks and options", "selftext": "I'll cut to the chase: to avoid losses, don't buy anything. To reduce the likelihood of losses, don't buy short term anything, unless you know what you're doing. Ever thought about posting whether to make a trade or keep holding? If so, you don't know what you're doing.\n\nEven though I know this will fall into the abyss of reddit's deaf ears canyon within days or minutes, perhaps one person will be saved from losing money they can ill afford.\n\nLet's say NVDA goes up 100% in a year. That means on the average, it goes up only .275% each of the 252 trading days in a year. Your margin of safety on an amazingly rapidly growing stock if you trade in 2 weeks is less than 3%. If NVDA is \\*only\\* increasing 50% annually, the average is only 1.61%.\n\nGuess what premiums (fees) are for options at the money for 2 weeks? About $4, which is 3%! So if NVDA went up as expected over the course of 10 trading days, these options would lose their entire \"investment\" value. So let's call buying short term options to make money what they really are - gambling. Go to Vegas to play roulette - at least the house will treat you nicely. \n\nBut you are lured because stock price moves in bursts, big swings in either direction. That's where there's a chance to make money, right? No, that's a chance to lose even more money because you need to make more trades, and then outsmart hedge funds, market makers, and institutions that literally have billions, or tens of billions at stake with the best mathematicians, statisticians, analysts, compute, and data.\n\nSome investors can consistently beat the big players because they're not the preys. The naive investors who behave like the rest of the herd are the prey.\n\nUnfortunately, if you're not an expert on technical analysis or cannot prevent emotions from affecting your investing, you are the prey. Besides, even without manipulation, short term options are guaranteed losers as you saw above. They \\*have\\* to be, because market makers sell these options to make money - which they do very consistently.\n\nEverything I said applies to short term stock investors, excluding the premiums. You are competing with big players that have an overwhelming edge. The psychology that works so well against options traders also works against short term stock investors. You'd have to predict the actions of the big players to win.\n\nAncient civilizations devised various models to predict the movement of celestial bodies. Some were better than others, but none were completely accurate because they didn't know the moon was spinning around the earth which was spinning around while twirling around the sun.\n\nThe stock market is like that - the forces impacting it include world events, market makers, funds, futures, bonds, economy - no one knows exactly which forces are acting on it or how, but there are definitely patterns. Technical analysis notes the patterns from historical data, but like ancient astronomy models, it's frequently wrong because it doesn't really know everything that's going on.\n\nMoreover, TA has to be imperfect, or else it wouldn't work.  If TA was always right, the patterns could be exploited algorithmically for everyone to make a profit, which obviously is impossible. It has to be wrong often enough to not be too exploitable.\n\nIn the long term though, stock prices will eventually converge to prices based on the fundamentals of the company. Short term, the price may not match and it could take months or even years, but if you hold long enough, SP will converge to the fundamentals price. Markets can be irrational, but they aren't irrational forever.\n\nThe way to beat the machinations of the great powers is to identify the stocks that should gain in the long term based on fundamentals, hold them long enough so the short term changes are lost in the noise, and pray that the fundamentals and market conditions remain long enough for you to profit. Each day that goes by accrues the .16% increase will averages in your favor.\n\nFinally, the very definition of investing is to take on the risk of loss in exchange for potentially greater gain. You will probably lose money for some investments despite your best efforts. This is normal and expected.\n\nIf you can't deal with losses, put your money into a savings account or CD.", "id": "1f5t998", "created_utc": 1725126905.0, "score": 115, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 78, "comments": [{"body": "####TL;DR    \n\nJust Hold", "score": 51, "replies": [{"body": "Held since $6", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": ".48", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Juicy!

It rarely takes that long to print, but pullbacks can come at the worst times and can last months. With 1.5 to 2 year DTE, I can wait it out without much decay.\n\nFor example, I bought some c140 exp \\~600 dte a few weeks ago when NVDA dipped below 100.

Still, I rarely buy LEAPs beyond 2 years because 1) I'm paying for more insurance (time) than I need, 2) it's less liquid than shorter expirations.\n\nIf you're buying shares, the beauty of it is that you have virtually no time limit and can focus on monitoring the assumptions.

I personally hate lost profits about as much as having losses (most people are hurt more by losses).\n\nGiven my dislike for missing gains, my approach is to keep my assets in NVDA, and swap between holding stock and holding options, depending on where the SP is relative to fundamentals. If SP is over valued, I convert options to stock and vice versa.\n\nPeople say that heavy concentration is risky, but all highly successful investors used concentrated positions. I've invested everything I had to start companies before. I feel much safer with NVDA's world class management team than anything I had at my companies, so concentration doesn't bother me.\n\nAlthough NVDA could go down by 70%, the whole market will probably do the same for anything so drastic. Until it does, I'd rather go for better risk adjusted rewards. The risk adjusted is the important part.\n\nHere's an example of how I might evaluate a situation: a 1.5 year NVDA c110/120 spread will probably return around 100% if NVDA is 120 or higher at expiration. In other words, if NVDA SP is stuck exactly at $120 for 1.5 years, I'd get the same gain as if a shareholder saw the stock price go to $240.\n\nIf NVDA is highly likely to be at least 120 after 1.5 years, I'd rather buy the spread than the stock because holding shares hoping to hit $240 in 1.5 years is pretty hard. In reality, I'd probably buy something like a 140/160 spread which might return closer to 2or 3x instead of 1x, but would require the SP to hit 160 to maximize return.

First things first, as many pointed it out, there was nothing fishy or out of ordinary what happened here.

In general, the option buyer has until 17:30 p.m. to exercise the contract. These times are set by OCC. But some brokerage firms might have an earlier cutoff than the OCC threshold. It is random and the option seller has no control over assignment\nIn your case by market close it was OTM, but as mentioned here from others, OTM Options can be assigned as well between 16:00 and 17:30. This is a quote from Schwab and you can read it on their website: \n“Does the underlying trade outside of regular market hours? For example, options that are ITM as of the close are typically automatically exercised, and OTM options aren’t. However, if the price of the underlying changes after the close, you might have a short option go from OTM to ITM. The option holder may choose to exercise, leaving you with an unwanted (or at least unexpected) position. However, there is also no guarantee that an ITM short option you hold will be assigned.”\n\n- A little clarification how assignment in general works: OCC facilitates the assignment process.\nAssume the call option holder (your counterpart) sends a request to exercise their call option. The broker sends a notice of exercise to OCC. The OCC randomly selects a clearing member firm (in this case Schwab) the exercised contract and assigns the firm the exercised option. The Schwab assigns the exercise to you holding the short option (either randomly or on a first-in, first-out basis). You must fulfill your obligation of the assignment and the broker then delivers the call writer’s shares to the OCC, who delivers the shares to the broker whose customer initially exercised the call option.\n\nSo, sorry that the representative didn’t clarify or misunderstood, but that’s a pretty standard process and Schwab was just fulfilling its obligation as you had to too.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Excellent and accurate explanation.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Thank you.
