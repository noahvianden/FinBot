{"title": "Warren Buffett Now Owns More T-Bills Than The Federal Reserve ", "selftext": "Berkshire Hathaway now holds more Treasury bills than the U.S. Federal Reserve, as Warren Buffett builds his cash reserves to an all-time high.\n\nThe Omaha-based conglomerate owned $234.6 billion in short-term investments, primarily in Treasury bills, by the end of the second quarter, with more than $42 billion in cash and cash equivalents, including T-bills maturing within three months or less, according to its quarterly financial report.\n\nThis compares to the $195.3 billion in T-bills held by the Fed as of July 31. The central bank owns $4.4 trillion in Treasury securities, including notes, bonds, and inflation-linked securities. The Fed was a significant buyer of government debt during the pandemic and remains one of the largest holders of Treasuries to maintain market liquidity.\n\nAt 93, Buffett surprised many by selling large portions of stock, including Apple, last quarter, just ahead of this week's global market sell-off. Berkshire has been offloading stocks for seven consecutive quarters, ramping up sales in the latest period with Buffett divesting over $75 billion in equities during the second quarter.\n\nLoyal Buffett watchers took his decision to offload major holdings as a sign of caution, interpreting the Oracle of Omaha's actions as a bearish turn on the economy and markets.\n\nBuffett has previously indicated that during crises, he prefers buying Treasury bills directly at auction. The government offers T-bills with terms ranging from four to 52 weeks.\n\nBuffett’s massive cash reserves have yielded significant returns thanks to rising Treasury yields over the past two years. With investments in 3-month T-bills yielding around 5%, $200 billion in cash could generate approximately $10 billion annually or $2.5 billion per quarter.\n\nPost-pandemic, the Fed bought about $5 trillion in Treasuries and mortgage bonds to support the economy. However, since June 2022, the Fed has been reducing its asset holdings through a process known as quantitative tightening.\n\nThe Fed’s goal is to ensure maximum employment and stable prices by independently managing monetary policy. This involves buying and selling Treasury securities held by the public to regulate money supply and interest rates.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/07/warren-buffett-now-owns-more-t-bills-than-the-federal-reserve.html", "id": "1emm4dd", "created_utc": 1723061703.0, "score": 202, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 80, "comments": [{"body": "Buffet is planning on implementing his own monetary policy.  😂", "score": 105, "replies": [{"body": "🤣🤣", "score": 15, "replies": []}, {"body": "Brk_coin_69", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "He’d solve way too many issues!😝", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "He could actually do that right?", "score": -1, "replies": [{"body": "he could, Nothing tangible or else the gov might hate him.
