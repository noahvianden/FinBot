In 2015 nvidia was a gaming company dabbling in some alternative uses for gpus which seemed promising but did not have many applications (relatively speaking to today). My tech friends loved nvidia because their ease of programming and libraries really let you do a lot with them! But nvidia stock was always 50% or higher than i really want yo pay for the stock, and amd had a more obvious roadmap to me, taking existing tam from a competitor(s) is easier to understand than the creation of new markets; which was nvidias primary story.\n\nIn 2015 nvidia was also just coming off of fermi which was a relative disaster that lost a lot of gpu share to amd. Maxwell hadn't launched (late 2016 early 2017??) yet which was nvidias really big improvement in architecture that launched them significantly ahead of amd in gaming gpus. The real key to nvidias success is their attitude of creating total solutions that let end users easily work with and develop on their products. They also are ruthless, if it benefits them they will absolutely sabatage their competitors and squeeze partners until they fold. As a consumer this is kind of frustrating as it hurts the overall ecosystem. As an investor it has benefitted them greatly.\n\nIf you are looking to find comapnies like nvidia in 2015 inwould say a few things.\n\n1) a ceo who know their company from top to bottom, and doesnt run it based on accounting numbers but based on engineering principles.\n\n2) is developing new solutions and is forward thinking.

All you had to do was listen to the CEO.  \n\n> In 2015 nvidia was a gaming company dabbling in some alternative uses for gpus which seemed promising but did not have many applications\n\nNvidia had an entire program dedicated to GPGPU including parallel programming education at top universities starting in early 2000s.   GPGPU was used for Monte Carlo Simulation and Black Shoals modeling in the financial community in the late aughts.  And the Eureka moment in ML was 2012.   This statement conveniently dismisses all that groundwork that was laid.\n\n>if it benefits them they will absolutely sabatage their competitors and squeeze partners until they fold.\n\nThat's what competitor's say anyway. . . \n\n> As a consumer this is kind of frustrating as it hurts the overall ecosystem.\n\nAs a consumer, they should want two strong choices, which they had when AMD bought ATI in 2006.   ATI was a much bigger company than Nvidia at that point.   What happened since is really on the combined efforts of ATI and AMD, not on Nvidia.   (RTG has also been guilty of benchmark cheating and shady marketing practices so, pot meet kettle.)  If AMD is unable to keep up, to match the development pace, or to forge strong alliances and initiatives with development community, why is that Nvidia's fault?\n\nI agree with your 1 and 2.\n\n>Vr and self driving cars are both markets that were supposed to make nvidia billions and flopped hard.\n\nVR was being pushed by goggle makers (Google, Meta, Qcom) not Nvidia.   Nvidia has always had the engines / infra to run this technology.   What flopped was the consumer facing effort to sell glasses.  As it is, VR remains a key feature for Omniverse, Nvidia supports apple now too, and that isn't going anywhere.  It's a pro-vis application, not consumer.\n\nSelf Driving remains an initiative that Elon Musk was promoting hard -- like with his hands free across the US 3000 mile un assisted promise to occur by the end of 2018.   This technology isn't dead, it's delayed.   In fact, Nvidia's lead customer Mercedes Benz is farther along than others in certification.   And self driving big rigs also continue to make headway.  \n\nTo say these technologies flopped is just wrong.

But listening to ceos spin a tale about how great their company, That is far from sufficient to pick a winner.\n\nMy comment about gpgpu being insignificant is from a revenue and ramp standpoint. In 2015 to 2022 their datacenter rampp and stock performance was very similar to amd comparing gains depending on exactly what time frame you look at. Obv 2022 onward has been a blowout.\n\nIts not just what their competitors say. See EVGA saying that nvidia has squeezed them so hard they can no longer make gpus, Linux (linus famousing saying nvidia is the worste and publicly flipping them off and saying, \"fuck you nvidia\"), GPP anticompetitive practices, and nvidia canceling HWU because they didnt say enough nice things about ray tracing. Amd has never canceled someone from a bad review, never had a partner publicly blast them for squeezing them out of business, and is a great linux partner. I get it, you are a fan of nvidia and huang . . . But lets not pretend. Amd/rtg is an incompetent partner. Nvidia is a greedy partner. They are not the same. I generally agree though that amds problems could be solved by better gpu hardware, better software support, and better development solutions. Nvidias schenanigans is not the primary cause of amds issues.\n\nAnd to be clear, i think nvidias business model of closed source is far superior to amds. As an investor idgaf about evga not being able to make gpus. Nvidia does the drivers, makes the gpu, qualities the memory, does all yhe hard shit. What do i care about an aib? I dont.\n\nWho cares if linus hates nvidia? Cry me a river the software nvidia does is amazing.\n\nBut lets make sure we understand . . . Being cutthroat in business can be a very good thing. For nvidia they have done very well. But lets not pretend.\n\nSelf driving and vr are not what contributed to nvidia being a 3t company. Without llm ai nvidia would still be sub 1T market cap.

It just hasn’t been updated to reflect the fact no one will buy their last 2 gen of CPU’s. \n\nAnd for assets, we need to remove 27442m of Goodwill. Because that’s a nothing account; you can’t make cash out of it. \n\nSo just the goodwill reduces them down to oh…180b of assets. Not counting all returns. \n\nThen we got liabilities that…appear to be 53b? This is hard to read with how they present it. \n\nBut they’re likely going to face some very large lawsuits that they don’t seem to be doing anything about. Which they’ll most likely lose in the EU, and in the US depends which court hears them. \n\nAll this to also say they have no good will with customers. \n\nAnd with firing a bunch of people and canceling the dividend, no goodwill from investors. \n\nSo…their adjusted 180b of assets, that is overstated BTW, less their liabilities (which is understated until a lawsuit hits) of 53b, returns 127b\n\nWhich even if we back out all of their AR and inventory, (3.1 + 11.2) leaves 112.7b Still greater than the 90b. \n\nSo, who wants to invest in a company that misled its customers and market partners, canceled its dividends, and slashed its workforce?
