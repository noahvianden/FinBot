{"title": "Choo Choo - Last Chance to hop on RDDT before the train leaves the station.", "selftext": "Hi all, you might remember me from last earnings report.  While I'm not doing a full port of nana's inheritance I am playing with my down payment money for my next house. Earnings is after market today.\n\nBasically my thesis remains the same.  Advertising revenue is a fairly inelastic market and the money flows based on cost and desire.  If you take a look at the ad revenue index for the past year ad revenue is continually rising.  In a normal year the expected ad revenue is highest in October through November steadily rising until the end of November.  This coincides with the Christmas season and then we have a steep dropoff in December going into the New Year.  \n\n  \nThis is a normal ad revenue chart, I went back to 2018 as Covid made things a bit wonky but if you look at every year prior to this the chart will look pretty much the same.  You can see this in more current years as well, but this is the gold standard of what historical ad revenue should look like.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/82egm2nam2hd1.png?width=531&format=png&auto=webp&s=9dd8beec01a8124438d461977bc8f2420baa6209\n\n  \nNow here is the chart for this year:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5salk1skm2hd1.png?width=1101&format=png&auto=webp&s=42ff710b74343f8b9b9dcc73cf2fe6ab3da3e41e\n\n  \nAd revenue is already at levels that are consistent with the highest spending months of last year.  This is based off of ezoics ad revenue index which shows the expected ad revenue for niche sites.\n\nThe niche site industry has been absolutely decimated over the past year because all of their traffic has been moving to AI or other more trustworthy websites.  One of those trustworthy websites is RDDT.  Take a look at this traffic chart showing the absolute explosion of search traffic that RDDT is getting from Google.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v0cn41r2n2hd1.png?width=584&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ee74c7ad6380647f2aef7cb1d4dfce5c49a4d93\n\nSince last year the search traffic that has been given to RDDT for free fromm Google has nearly tripled.  While not every one of these users converts to a logged in user this is an absolute firehose of traffic with no end in site.  My wife has been using rddt, my non techy friends use rddt, it's become a trustworthy source of knowledge for the average person out there.  Without even converting these users to logged in users there are an additional 600 million non-logged in users per month compared to last year.\n\n  \nThis chart shows the quarterly revenue per user.  We have ascertained that the revenue for user should remain steady or increase because of the increase in advertising revenue over the past year.  But what happens when we add in all of the new users?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uf8aq36ao2hd1.png?width=634&format=png&auto=webp&s=12538f47ed1c4385749b59468eb81ca6be6ee0ff\n\nHere is the breakdown of logged in users and logged out users:  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u0iksnpto2hd1.png?width=637&format=png&auto=webp&s=867aa01b2e693f1816f8cb2e05cf6dd9f669f529\n\nThat number on the top right is going to explode, with the grey bar exceeding 50-60 million and the orange bar which is logged in users lagging slightly.  I wouldn't be surprised to see a 20% quarterly growth in users though because of all of the new traffic being sent there way.\n\n  \nAdditional tailwinds are improving ad technology and adding new ad partners (did you see all the apple ads).  We are also entering the election season which is an advertising supercycle with October-November ad spend likely going to be 2X in terms of RPM what it is now.  Short interest is also at 25% right now which will give us a big pop as soon as earnings drops.  Steve mentioned last earnings that revenue was growing at a 3x rate to cost which would give us a profitable quarter even without all of these tailwinds.\n\nThe biggest thing here though is the new users, a quarter that will be profitable.\n\nThe only headwind is macroeconomic conditions and lockup period expiring 3 days after earnings, but if I was inside this company seeing this type of growth I would absolutely not be selling.  This is gonna pop massively on earnings, but also be a long term hold for the next 5-10 years.\n\nPositions 2000 shares.  \n10 call's between 55.0 and 64.5.", "id": "1elmujy", "created_utc": 1722963130.0, "score": 30, "upvote_ratio": 0.73, "num_comments": 73, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 2 | **First Seen In WSB** | 7 months ago\n**Total Comments** | 101 | **Previous Best DD** | [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1elmujy/choo_choo_last_chance_to_hop_on_rddt_before_the/) \n**Account Age** | 2 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I thought about making a small safe investment on your thoughtful statements.

That's $24,000 a year, and I wake way more trades than that.\n\nWhen you are buying OTM calls and puts you are going to get nickled and dimed to death by people like me. Eventually you are going to lose.  For every time you have a trade where the price goes beyond your strike you are going to have 19 times it doesn't and you lose money.   That's not me making up numbers, that's historical evidence.\n\nYou can do high risk trades without buying a call (or put).  Like if you are bullish, sell an ITM put spread.
