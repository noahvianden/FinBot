Gather around if you‚Äôre interested, let me put yall on game. \n\n2018: Nvidia's stock dropped (~50%) from its peak in 2 months bc the media decided GPU sales were dead bc cyrpto crashed. \n\n2020: Down (~28%), self explanatory. \n\n2021: Down (~15%) start of U.S.-China trade tensions.\n\n2022: Declined (~65%) over a period of November 21 to late 22, bc inflation fucked the market and interest rates were hiked by 4.25% (425bps) \n\n2023: Down (~18%) more china concerns \n\nIf you bought the stock to chase short term gains, then you were brought here by the memeification of the stock market and followed the crowd like a herded sheep. You need to do more reading and research to understand the risks behind what you‚Äôre investing in. \n\nTIME IN > TIMING\n\nI‚Äôve read so many posts of people crying about ‚ÄúOMG AM I FUCKED?

Nvidia will guaranteed grow their revenues over the next 5-10 years. By how much? No one knows, but it will determine how much the stock declines or moons over time. \n\nI know there‚Äôs others out there who feel the same. \n\nTo anyone new - Just learn to embrace the volatility. Detach youself emotionally from money and don‚Äôt use cash you‚Äôve deemed as an ‚Äúemergency fund‚Äù. Take advantage of market wide volatility to load up on your position if you have extra funds.

{"title": "Update: American consumer credit is tapped out part 2", "selftext": "Lady and gentlemen, 2 months ago [I came](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1dcghne/american_consumer_credit_is_tapped_out_and_growth/) to you with the most autistic examination of economic data I could muster while only 4 shots in, and ended up drinking my own Kool-aid to the price of a LEAPS put against QQQ at the $480 strike expiring June of 2025. Today, I have an update on the data, the events of the past 2 months, and the position. Please see that topic for a broader explanation of my thesis and reasoning.\n\n**TL;DR**: I thought American consumers were defaulting on credit cards as fast as they were spending, and we were headed into a recession within a year.\n\n# What does the new data say?\n\nThe [G.19](https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g19/current/default.htm) dropped of the 7th with June economic data on the American consumer. Revolving credit is down -1.5% YoY seasonally adjusted, and non-revolving credit is up 3.4%. This seems to confirm that May's increase in revolving credit was a fluke. We can also look at motor vehicle loans and see there was a spike in spending. Since the other part of my \"consumers are tapped out\" thesis was Americans weren't buying cars, what gives? Well two things have happened. First, vehicle interest rates are still quite high, so it's possible that some delinquencies are continuing to pile up interest. Vehicles are generally quick to be repossessed though so take that with a grain of salt and we would expect this to at this point be deflationary. What else is happening is vehicle prices [especially on the used market](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CUSR0000SETA02) are starting to fall back to natural levels. This is bringing their prices more in line with actual demand, which is healthy. However it is also deflationary and thus points to a weakened consumer vs. previous market expectations, as current demand cannot sustain the high prices. The used car market is a canary in the consumer demand coal mine, as all discretionary spending will likely follow. The artificially inflated prices we have seen the past few years will begin to fall off a cliff as consumers are forced to make more and more drastic cuts to their spending in order to keep their heads above water.\n\nThis sentiment is being echoed by weak guidance by Q2 earnings reports based on consumer spending habits. In my last post I predicted a mid Q2 earnings followed by weakened guidance and that appears to be what we're seeing, as the ETF I primarily trade, QQQ, dropped from over $500 at its high to around $430 within the past 2 months. All the pieces are coming together and, if anything, it looks like things are happening faster than I anticipated. I see either a market crash before the election, or a major downward pull followed by a strong run-up then the crash in Q4/Q1 2025. It is my opinion that a bear market is on the horizon, and we've already seen a blip of what might be possible when the tumbling begins, so I'm making final preparations to go whole hog into even more bearish positions.\n\n# Position Update\n\nLast post I updated that I'd purchased a $480 strike put on QQQ for June 2025 for $3,400. I sold this on 08/05 for $5,750 and traded a short put against it in the meantime to lower my basis. Now, except for a QQQ 430/435 08/16 CCS I sold, I'm holding cash and playing earnings, waiting for this green rebound to top out before I reposition into long puts for 2025.", "id": "1eoe3g4", "created_utc": 1723245264.0, "score": 187, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 78, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 3 | **First Seen In WSB** | 3 years ago\n**Total Comments** | 179 | **Previous Best DD** | [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1eoe3g4/update_american_consumer_credit_is_tapped_out/) \n**Account Age** | 3 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Bro this is a casino get outa here with your long words.", "score": 247, "replies": [{"body": "Did not get what you said.
