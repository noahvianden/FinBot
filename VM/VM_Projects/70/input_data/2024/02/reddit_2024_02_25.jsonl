{"title": "Buying NVDA stocks before Sora goes public?", "selftext": "The title briefly explains it, I was thinking that since we are at very beginning of the AI era (just look at the exponential progress we are seeing in the last year) and NVIDIA is the top partner in the market OpenAI has, it would make sense to invest now even if the stocks are high, because most probably this is (hope this post will age well lol) just the initial phase of an industrial revolution that's gonna change the world forever over the next years and it will be the most valuable field in which everyone is going to want to invest.\nMoreover, the computational power they need to run different environments/different products will require upgrades over the years, NVIDIA has recently also started to invest in AI data factories, which means their market will grow exponentially without doubt.\n\nOpinions about this?\n\nI was thinking about investing 3000€ in NVDA and 1000€ in AMD.", "id": "1b00f6z", "created_utc": 1708898710.0, "score": 30, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 79, "comments": [{"body": "This post is a bit misleading.\n\nFirst off Open Ai is not a “top partner” of NVDA, they are seeking ways to directly compete with NVDA in chip production. \n\nSora is a product of Open AI which has two sides,  the non-profit and for-profit. The board would have to okay the for-profit to go public which is unlikely. Now if you meant when Sora is released to the public’s then that is different. \n\nIf your entire strategy to invest in NVDA  is hinging on Sora, you need to do a little research. First off OpenAI mostly uses Microsoft Azure servers which have the H100 chips in a deal where MSFT can use ChatGPT for Co-pilot. Sam Altman CEO of OpenAI  has been discussing manufacturing its own chips for Open AI through AMD to directly compete with NVDA in that space. Also, MSFT is looking to develop its own chips as well. If this will happen is unknown but it would be a stretch to call Open AI a top partner of NVDA\n \nSo I understand this is all exciting, the stock is ripping, and people want to know if they should buy. But please do your DD before posting misleading information. \n\nThe text to video is mind boggling but the bigger picture for AI is search. ChatGPT uses inference and Google uses Index. Once people get used to having answers (inference) vs breadcrumbs (index) the search business will evolve. Once generative AI has memory and can recall and store your previous discussions it will move into a broader personal assistant technology. All the memory features will need to be trained and use massive GPU compute. Text to video will be a big use in advertising and creation but this will not be solely a Sora dominated area. Adobe already has Firefly which is a text based generative fill feature in Photoshop. Not sure if they have any developments in video but this may be coming from Adobe and else where. \n\nSo to your question about investing in NVDA. Do you see it maintaining a large market share in chip production and data servers? Yes invest now. \n\nIf your investing in NVDA is hinging on Sora…do more research so you feel comfortable.", "score": 21, "replies": [{"body": "So on that note of OpenAI wanting to basically compete with NVDA...do you see it happening through AMD or you think they will find their own GPU chip Niche?

I think it possible they could get chips up and running but at this point NVDA has a walled garden with the Cuda software and massive demand in the market. I don't know for sure but I heard Brad Gerstner discussing that it would be 2 years most likely if that.\n\nEDIT: NVDA is where it is at and this year if earnings continue to beat expectations you could see 1000 per share by 2025. GTC is next month and historically proves as a huge catalyst for NVDA. I am planning to buy more before this since they may be unveiling new product lines there. So keep that on your radar.

In my opinion it's going to be the opposite, people won't just accept to be cut out of the business because of AI, and companies will still need people to do the job even if it's going to be easier. Due to this, there will be a round of adaption in which artists and AIs will sorta merge together and learn from each other, making it more easy to produce art since you will more likely need less and less technical skills over time and more creativity. Since creativity is easier to find in people compared to on-the-field skills, companies will probably hire less people and use the money they saved to pay more software licenses, cause they are all gonna be subscription based over the next years, generating a problem on the job market for real artists but at the same time growing the AI one, because more people will use the products due to their accessibility (e.g: same way Apple took over smartphones market compared to Nokia)\nThat basically means Adobe will grow in the next years any case scenario, moreover because they've already been leaders of their niche for the last 20 years.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Good question", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I think Adobe will be fine.
