Their stock price is based on expected growth years down the line that simply isn't possible in a fab constrained market, let alone with all the competition coming their way. AMD has the MI300X already on the market, it's significantly cheaper and rivals the H100. Intel will have Gaudi 3 later this year that's supposed to \"handily beat\" the H100, and will most likely also be significantly cheaper. Once Intel starts ramping up HVM production on 18A later this year, this will accelerate that competition, because Intel will be able to mass produce more chips on cutting edge tech that dwarfs what's currently available. TSMC won't have any new fab space until late 2025 at the very earliest, or 2026 if there are even more delays (which is likely). This isn't even accounting for the up and comers like Google (including a collab with Intel), Amazon, IBM, Meta, Broadcom, Qualcomm, etc. All are working on taking a piece of that pie, and they're willing to team up to unseat Nvidia. The days of companies writing blank checks for data center chips are coming to an end.\n\nStock price is representative of mindshare.

AMD has tried to catch up to them for many years just in gaming GPUs alone. It would take years for Nvidia to lose a substantial amount of their current percentage of the AI market.\n\nAlso, last year they had 3 models of GPUs that were AI focused. This year they're releasing 7 variants (including the upcoming Huawei competitor). They are using different nodes which allows more volume to reach customers, and they're still sold out.

TSMC is doubling output this year to 20%, up from last year's 10%. \n\nKeep in mind, this is only their AI product line.

Nvidia's hands are never idle. They're *always* working on something.

Even if they manage to stay ahead technologically against all the competition heading their way, now that there's viable alternatives on the market that offer significantly better price to performance valuations, they won't be able to enjoy these sky high margins they've seen over the last year.

Paypal will report earnings after the bell on February 7th with the earnings call to follow. All eyes will be on how the CEO (Alex Chriss) plans to save the company that many believe is a melting ice cube. With that being said, let’s dive into the analysis and see where the stock could potentially head post earnings and in the future.\n\n\nDescription: \n\n\nPaypal Holdings Co (NYSE: PYPL) is a payment processing company that also owns Venmo, a popular P2P payment app focused in the United States. The company has faced nothing but pressure this year with increased competition and the process of changing management also impacting business strategy. Q4 will be the first good look into how CEO Alex Chriss operates, and by the looks of it cost cutting and making the company leaner will be at the top of his priorities. The introduction of Apple Pay and Google Pay have spelt disaster for Paypal, and analysts hope to see an updated combat plan from management to keep growing and expanding market share along with potential opportunities to expand the revenue streams within the company. Last week, management announced they would be laying off 9% of the workforce, which isn’t terribly surprising as over 100 technology companies have announced layoffs over the past several years to consolidate operations.\n\n\nFinancial Breakdown:\n\n\nLTM Price Increase: $83.23 – $63.72 (-23.44%)\nUsers: Q3 2023 – 428MM | Q2 2023 – 431MM \nRevenue increase: +8% YoY Q3 and +1.7% Q2-Q3\nCompetitors: Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOGL), Block (SQ)\n\n\nEarnings:\n\n\nQ3 Reported EPS: $1.30 (+5.78% delta from expected) | Q3 Reported Revenue: $7.42B (+0.47% delta)\n\nStock Move: Stock jumped +8.59% after earnings\n\nQ4 Expected EPS: $1.36 | Q4 Expected Revenue: $7.87B\n\n\nVerdict: \n\n\nWith Paypal reporting earnings after market close on February 7th, it will be interesting to see how the new management has fared in the face of fierce competition. After months of bad news, analysts are hoping to see positive signs across the company. Looking at the performance of this stock, I can’t help but compare it to Boeing and Ford. All three of these companies were beat down and had poor expectations heading into earnings, and as expected any positive news resulted in a bounce. The largest difference here is that this is a technology company, so Snapchat could be a better comparison where underperformance spells disaster. Looking at the steps the company is taking, it seems like guidance will be positive with various cost saving measures implemented along with the introduction of efficiency increasing measures like AI. I think the largest challenge for this company will be beating lofty earnings expectations but if they can do that, I expect a massive bounce (~9%). It will be interesting to see how the company performs overseas, as there is plenty of opportunity in developing nations for services like Venmo. \n\n\nPrior to providing my opinion, I must preface with a disclosure that options trading is extremely risky and losing all your money is a very real possibility and that this is not financial advice. Whether you elect to agree with my personal decision is entirely up to you, and this post is simply intended to provide more information into the company. As we head into the report, I am hoping to see a beat across the board with EPS and Revenue figures. Seeing as this is the managements’ first major test with a quarter under their belt, they cannot afford to perform poorly. I expect online payments to continue expanding, and therefore hope to see Paypal post positive growth from last quarter. The presence of ecommerce is a massive opportunity that I believe the company will be able to monetize and can see guidance being positive. Now, seeing as the risk for this report is off the charts, I am not loading up too heavily in either direction. I purchased 3 $64.00 calls expiring February 9th. The expected move for this stock is +/- 8.4% so the $64.00 calls offer ample profits IF AND ONLY IF the company can showcase improvements from last quarter. As of now, the company is viewed as a buy opportunity by most analysts due to its low P/E ratio, so a bounce could happen. Stock like this have incredible downward pressure and most expect it to decrease post earnings, but I am inversing the sentiment as I believe much of the trouble is priced in. But, the lofty Revenue and EPS figures certainly pose a challenge and could result in collapse of the stock. \n\nStop deleting my posts, this is unique work not AI generated. We have a few more earnings to play this week (PINS, etc.), so expect to see more posts like this one. Please leave a like and comment if you want to see more.
