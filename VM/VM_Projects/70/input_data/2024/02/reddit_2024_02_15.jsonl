{"title": "Here‚Äôs why there‚Äôs a semiconductor bubble forming.", "selftext": "No one can deny that there‚Äôs a secular trend to need an immense number of GPUs, and that NVIDIA is in the catbird seat right now.\n\nBut the reality is that the semiconductor industry is still entirely cyclical.  It‚Äôs constrained by the capacity of manufacturing, which drives pricing/demand cycles in addition to surplus/shortage cycles as new fab capacity gets built. These are just laws of economics 101. AI doesn‚Äôt change that one bit.\n\nFabs take 5-10 years to build and are so expensive that no firm, especially not one as conservatively managed as TSMC, is going to start spending wildly aggressively like they believe the cyclical nature of their business just changed with one (powerful) new invention in generative AI.\n\nSo that still means this whole story will eventually be constrained by fab capacity.  And pricing/rights to that capacity gets renegotiated every 3-5 years for the big TSMC customers like NVIDIA, Apple, and AMD.  Unless TSMC feels charitable, they‚Äôll be able to collect margins with a pricing war going on.\n\nThis is why I believe Sam Altman is going around panhandling for $7T like some sort of sage hobo.  He sees around this corner and knows his company (and NVIDIA) really have no moat here.  It‚Äôs the fab companies that have the moat, and the rest of the entire semiconductor value chain is beholden to their cyclical investment cycle.  The only way OpenAI and NVIDIA keep their stories in tact is if they can claim and manage a fab capacity moat that is so large it lets them play in a fantasy world free of economic cycles.\n\nThen, at some point generative AI will need to deliver on its hype, and new technologies always take longer to find their core use cases once disillusionment has run its course.  When that happens, capacity will have reached new levels, pricing will have skyrocketed, and customers won‚Äôt be able to justify the cost any longer and the economic cycle will move forward as always. Maybe we are very close to this point already.\n\nSo NVIDIA, and their other suppliers like SMIC, are all exposed to several different risks that will pop the bubble eventually (but who knows how big the bubble can get, I‚Äôm certainly not going to short it.  The pop could come from‚Ä¶ \n\n1/ TSMC capacity not keeping up with NVIDIAs growth targets.  Either because growth exceeds the available capacity today, or because the investment in new fabs is known to change the growth trajectory possible within 3-5 years.\n\n2/ Fab capacity being won by other players whose growth stories and margins aren‚Äôt on-par with NVIDIA (like Apple, or the hyperscale cloud providers). \n\n3/ China making a move on Taiwan, even just the threat of a move could shift sentiment enough to pop a bubble.\n\n4/ Customer demand for generative AI use cases waning, or public interest in it waning (if no one has delivered the killer application for it by the next fab investment cycle).\n\n5/ Any innovations that increase the efficiency of LLM training and inference and reduce the compute capacity required by customers.\n\n6/ Regulatory pressure, especially from the EU, that would outlaw the use of customer data in any model training.\n\nAny one of these developments will alter the story overnight.  It doesn‚Äôt change the secular growth story of semis, or make them a bad longterm investment.  But it does mean the bubble we are seeing in names like SMIC, ARM, and yes even NVIDIA will hit a reality-driven wall at some point in the future. \n\nGood luck on timing it if you want to get rich.", "id": "1ar3446", "created_utc": 1707958694.0, "score": 42, "upvote_ratio": 0.68, "num_comments": 80, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|4|**First Seen In WSB**|3 years ago\n**Total Comments**|156|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|13 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Here's why your post is bullshit: no positions.", "score": 92, "replies": [{"body": "Sometimes taking no position is an explicit decision.
