Under this agreement they issued 1.5 million preferred share in exchange for cash proceed, 550 million book value (fair value is 832.50 million), the preferred share required Celsius to pay a 5% dividend, to me this is like a collateral just in case shit go south. Moreover, \n\n· “The revenue elements of the Pepsi Arrangement consisted of (i) $227.8 million in payments received from Pepsi under the Transition Agreement, this money is used to terminate fee with former distributors. \n\n· (ii) a $282.5 million implicit payment made to Pepsi by Celsius, representing the excess fair value over issuance proceeds received for the Series A Preferred Stock. \n\nAs a result, the revenue recognition method is somewhat in question here\n\nMoreover, it is very important to note in their annual 10k, Item 9A Control and Procedures. \n\n“material weakness in internal control over financial reporting continues to exist as of December 31, 2023 with respect to the following processes as the result of the ineffective design and operation of business process level controls: \n\n(i) accounting for revenue recognition, \n\n(ii) (ii) accounting for promotional allowances, and \n\n(iii) (iii) accounting for inventories.\n\n2. I have checked previous annual report, and apparently, the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting is a on-going issue for over 4 years now. This is significant, it poses a question that if you want to invest in a company that has a weak internal control over their financial reporting ? what is the possibility they manipulate earning and massage the number, hypothetically speaking, evidence using during audit is not reliable at all \n\n3. When compare Celsius to Monster beverage, Celsius is more expensive than monster why ?\n\n1. PE of monster is 37.89 vs 59.17\n\n2. Profit margin monster 22.84 vs Celsius 13.54\n\n3. Operating margin monster 25.08 vs Celsius 25.39%\n\n4. Monster has bigger market cap vs Celsius. \n\n5. Monster price per book 7.39 vs Celsius 73.51\n\n6. Monster % short of float 2.04% vs 38.04%\n\nwhen you take a look at put option expiry in Jan 2025, the cost of put is high, for example, Put with strike price at 65 at 8.00, Implied Volatility = 53.43%\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs a result of the above, I think the market tries to price in price decline. \n\nConclusion\n\nI have not taken any short position or buy a put option on this bad boy yet. but it is interesting to see how it turns out. Words of wisdom, \"you can be right but the market will stay irrational longer than you think\". so if you decide to take a put position, please have a long timeline, and buy put close to ITM", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "I have a long position in Celsius…I sure hope they beat tomorrow!", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "[removed]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Holy shit.
