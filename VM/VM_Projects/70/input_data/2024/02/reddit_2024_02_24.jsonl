How is it architected?  Is it programmable or an ASIC, how does it adapt, how does it perform, how is it integrated into existing architectures, and how are SOTA workloads migrated?

I've seen multiple tremendous MC loses, the worst of which was like 80%, so I know very well what you speak of.\n\nIf one hasn't held NVDA for multiple years, I agree these concerns are well appreciated and risk is higher.   But I believe things are going to play out differently.\n\nLet's just take the 3.5 year runway is stipulated.   What Nvidia has developed is a platform like the iPhone, I think you see that.  They have 90%+ market share in a end market that is growing at \\~35% CAGR.   Next year they will report, idk, $130-150B, and they year after probably north of $175B.   Growth is going to slow after Q1, the 1 yr comparables will become less eye popping so a gradual change is predictable. \n\nBut the end of THIS run is going to be more like Apple than Crypto:  More of a  plateau than a cliff.  Why?  Because of earnings.   Nvidia is going to put a fortune in the bank over the next 3.5 years, just as apple has.   That cash and ongoing profitability acts like a buffer on volatility.   The multiples will come down eventually to something more modest, I'd be happy with 25 instead of mid to high 30s, which we seem well on our way to again.   \n\nBut it's going to be bumpy for a while.  All I would advise is don't freak out unless there is really something to freak out about.   A more near term concern to me is saturation or digestion by the CSPs -- can they take all the chips Nvidia wants to build? -- that would hit the stock hard for a quarter or two or three.  But I don't see that sort of risk forming until at least till 2025+.   And I personally don't think that's a freak out type event even though it could put a serious dent (15-20%?) into MC.  That would be a buying opportunity for me simply because of the growth outlook.\n\nHigh tech investing is tough.  But its the adrenaline rush like last week that makes it so rewarding.
