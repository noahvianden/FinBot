{"title": "Why I Believe Nvidia Will Continue To Grow For The Remainder of 2024", "selftext": "The Santa Clara, California-based company controls about 80% of high-end AI chip market, a position that has sent its stock market value up 40% so far this year to $1.73 trillion after it more than tripled in 2023.\n\nAs of February 13, 2024 Nvidia has a P/E ratio of 95.24 which may seem high and it totally is understandable. Company seems overweight, compared to competitors such as Intel who have or P/E ratio of 107.63 or AMD 326.41. Compared to competitors they are not as over valued. \n\nLets compare Nvidia with other companies around its market cap. Amazon has a P/E ratio of 58.16. The difference between Amazon and Nvidia is Nvidia is bound for more growth in the near future with the boom of AI which they control the AI chip market by a crazy 80%. What about their financials, last quarter Nvidia had 18.12 Total Revenue with a net income of 9.24 billion. Amazon had 143.08 billion with net income of 9.88 billion. Nvidia has a huge profit margin of 51.01% compared to Amazon's measly  6.9%. No doubt Amazon is trying to create a bigger net profit margin but so would Nvidia. \n\nRecently Canada had signed a letter of intent to engage in business with Nvidia. Recent CEO Huang discussed that not only is Canada prioritizing AI infrastructure but also Japan, France, South Korea, Malaysia, Italy and Britain. This tells us that countries want to buy these chips from producers around the world which Nvidia are currently leading. Only problem is supply chain issues.\n\nWith this kind of demand meeting supply is dificult. Hopefully Nvidia is able to capitalize this and meet this enormous demand with increased prices to maximize revenue.\n\nNvidia is setting foot in creating energy efficient computing for AI. They are making custom chips for clients such as Meta, Amazon, etc... To become more efficient in specific needs for each clients. This opens up multiple new paths for increased revenue. Not just that Nvidia is creating Gpu's for the consumers which compute the power for AI, of course enough power to game and design.\n\n\\---**Major current buyers:**\n\n* **Cloud giants:**\n   * **Meta:** A major spender, reportedly purchasing billions of dollars worth of H100 chips for their Metaverse ambitions and AI development.\n   * **Microsoft:** Another big investor, aiming to power cloud services and its Azure AI platform with Nvidia's tech.\n   * **Amazon:** Utilizing Nvidia chips for their AWS cloud services and internal AI endeavors.\n   * **Google:** While Google develops its own AI chips, they also leverage Nvidia's technology for specific applications.\n* **Tech companies:**\n   * **Baidu:** China's tech giant is reportedly a significant buyer, using Nvidia chips for AI research and development.\n   * **Tencent:** Another Chinese tech player heavily invested in AI, likely utilizing Nvidia's chips for various projects.\n   * **Alibaba:** Their spending details are less transparent, but they're likely in the mix due to their extensive AI efforts.\n   * **Dell:** As a major PC and server manufacturer, they incorporate Nvidia GPUs in their offerings, contributing to Nvidia's sales.\n\n\\---**Potential future buyers:**\n\n* **Other cloud providers:** Companies like IBM Cloud and Oracle Cloud could increasingly turn to Nvidia chips for their AI offerings.\n* **Startups and smaller companies:** As AI gains traction in various industries, adoption of Nvidia's technology by smaller players is expected to grow.\n* **Governments:** For projects in areas like national security, healthcare, and research, governments could become significant buyers.\n\n\\---**Global reach, with limitations:**\n\n* Nvidia does aim for widespread sales, reaching numerous countries across the globe. They have customers in various regions, including North America, Europe, Asia, and more.\n\n\\---**Export controls and restrictions:**\n\n* However, Nvidia needs to adhere to export control regulations set by the US government, where they're headquartered. These regulations might restrict sales to specific countries or for certain uses.\n\n**Examples of restrictions:**\n\n* In October 2023, the US implemented restrictions on selling their most advanced AI chips to China, aiming to prevent their use for military or other sensitive applications.\n* Similar restrictions might apply to other countries in the future, depending on evolving policies.\n* Such restrictions can reduce sales but they weren't selling much to China either way. Now they sell chips with slightly less computing power.\n\n**Upcoming potential announcements (based on rumors and speculations):**\n\n* **GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs:** While not officially confirmed, new consumer graphics cards are expected sometime in 2024 or 2025, likely offering further performance boosts for gamers.\n* **Next-gen DRIVE autonomous vehicle platform:** Nvidia's self-driving technology is constantly evolving, and the next iteration of the DRIVE platform might bring significant advancements.\n* **New AI chips:** Beyond the recently released H100, Nvidia is likely working on even more powerful and specialized AI chips for various applications.  With the H200 coming second quarter of 2024.\n\nThe biggest worries are geopolitical tensions and export restrictions. Do what you will with this info regards.\n\nEdit: my positions 15 shares, picked them up today but on the come up I bought and sold shares.
