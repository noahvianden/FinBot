Economists previously surveyed by Dow Jones had expected a 0.3% decrease.*\n\n*Meanwhile, the latest initial weekly jobless claims — also released Thursday — suggested continued strength in the labor market, coming in at 212,000 down from an upwardly revised 220,000 in the previous period.*\n\n*Earlier in the week, the consumer price index for January showed a 0.3% increase on a monthly and a 3.1% rise on an annual basis, just above expectations.*\n\n*Investors have been closely watching economic data for hints about whether the economy is easing, which could hint at interest rate cuts beginning soon.*\n\n*Uncertainty about when rate cuts will take place and how many there will be this year has been rife among market participants in recent weeks, alongside concerns about the impact of elevated rates on the economy.

In January, most of the advance is attributable to prices for final demand services less trade, transportation, and warehousing, which climbed 0.8 percent. The index for final demand trade services moved up 0.2 percent. (Trade indexes measure changes in margins received by wholesalers and retailers.) Conversely, prices for final demand transportation and warehousing services fell 0.4 percent.* \r  \n\r  \n*Product detail:*\n\n*A 2.2-percent increase in the index for hospital outpatient care was a major factor in the January rise in prices for final demand services. The indexes for chemicals and allied products wholesaling, machinery and equipment wholesaling, portfolio management, traveler accommodation services, and legal services also moved higher. In contrast, prices for long-distance motor carrying decreased 1.0 percent. The indexes for computer hardware, software, and supplies retailing and for engineering services also moved lower.*\r  \n\r  \n*Final demand goods:*\n\n*The index for final demand goods moved down 0.2 percent in January, the fourth consecutive decline. Most of the January decrease is attributable to a 1.7-percent drop in prices for final demand energy. The index for final demand foods fell 0.3 percent. Conversely, prices for final demand goods less foods and energy increased 0.3 percent.*\r  \n\r  \n*Product detail:*\n\n*Leading the January decline in the index for final demand goods, prices for gasoline fell 3.6 percent. The indexes for electric power; hay, hayseeds, and oilseeds; beef and veal; ethanol; and iron and steel scrap also moved lower. In contrast, prices for communication and related equipment increased 2.4 percent.

I’ll have to look more into the details of it as it sounds interesting.\n\nWith that said I’m not sure I buy the idea  that a relatively small nominal decrease in money supply reflects QT in its current form isn’t ’real QT’ at some level. M2 is not just down from its ATH, it’s down during a period of elevated inflation. Inflation adjusted money supply would likely much more clearly show the transmission of QT in its current incarnation but doesn’t seem to be a thing (or at least I’m not seeing it on google).

In fact, bank lending has a bigger influence on M2 than the Fed does directly. The original point of the overnight rate was to manipulate bank lending, where higher Fed rates would slow or reduce broad lending. Reserve requirements also manipulates M2, because it determines how much loan value a given amount of deposits can create.\n\nThe monetary base is more interesting, in my opinion. This is basically the Fed's balance sheet. You can see that QT did reduce M0 very significantly, but the BTFP has more than countered any further QT since March 2023.\n\nhttps://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/BOGMBASE\n\nIt takes a long time for increased money to work its way into equilibrium prices. My fear is that we still have a very long way to go before prices reflect the surge in M0 since 2019. The reason why the QE from 2009-2016 didn't increase inflation noticeably is that demand for dollars remained high since Europe was in recession in 2015 or so, and most importantly because bank reserve requirements were increased dramatically around the world following the 2009 banking crisis (which on its own would have shrunk M2).
