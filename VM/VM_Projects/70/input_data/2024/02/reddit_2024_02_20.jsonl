I've started my journey in learning options and I'm appreciating and loving what I ready here everyday!\n\nCheers and good luck tomorrow!", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "They are not exactly cancelling the IV. See, high IV means high prices for the options. More or less all the options. So when you buy a high price call at strike X, you also sell a high priced call at strike X+Y. So one high price partially negates the other. If the price is above X+Y at expiration - you will profit. Even if Y is small. The catch is - spreads are limited in the maximum profit. And the bigger the IV is - the smaller is the maximum profit relative to the spread price. But the profit always be there.\n\nThe numbers change, but close to actual. Now NVDA is at 670. 670-675 call spread costs like 2.5 ask. So if NVDA ends up at 675 or more - you get paid 675 - 670 = 5, you profit 2.5, doubling your bet and nothing more. Call at 670 costs 34. NVDA needs to shoot to 738 to give similar payout as those spreads, as you can actually buy more than one spread. But there is more! If you think NVDA will shoot to 738, then 730-735 call spread costs only 1.35 at ask with 5 max payout, so 3.7 times profit. NVDA needs to go to 795 to match that if you buy a call. You can repeat the process at 790-795 call spread etc. \n\nSo should you always use spreads? No, any and all strategies, unless their profits are eaten by the bid-ask spreads are the best for some specific risk profile. And the more legs you have - the more MMs fuck you with the ask-bid spread. You do not really know, where NVDA will end up. If you buy 670-675 spreads and NVDA went beyond 738 - you'd be better if you bought the 670 call. If you bought 730-735 spreads and NVDA ended up 800+ - you'd be better if you bought call. AND for that same 730-735 spread, you'd end better with a call if NVDA is in range like 671 - 730! That can happen too!\n\nAnd also calls can be used for strategies like diagonal spreads/poor man's covered calls, plain deep ITM LEAPS.\n\nBut if you have a range in mind and prefer to take the money at some high point, forfeiting possible profits if it will go higher - you should use spread. If you are sure about the direction, but afraid the IV will screw you - you should probably use it. So if OP has a direction in mind, why not take the 2x payout that ATM spread gives, with more than 10 times less minimum entry price than the call?\n\nAlso, disclaimer - do your own research, check my words, maybe all that is bullshit), UNDERSTAND the options and their pricing.
