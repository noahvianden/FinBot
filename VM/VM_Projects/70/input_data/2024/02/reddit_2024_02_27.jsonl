But thats not the only macro play for semiconductors right now. \n\nThe other big thing going on is the \"localization\" effort, in particular the Chinese effort to increase their ability to make homegrown chips. This is the critical bottleneck to their war machine. They know they cannot invade Taiwan without this capability. \n\nSo what are they doing? They are making massive investments to build their own foundries. If we know one thing about China, it's when they set their mind to something they accomplish it extremely fast, and without concern for overbuilding. Look at their subways. Look at their empty high-rise apartments.\n\nThey will swarm like ants and build 10 factories faster than the US can build one.\n\n**The businesses that supply the necessary components and toolings stand to accelerate their growth.** \n\n# Enter ACMR\n\nACMR is one such company that has caught me eye. It's on a tear the past 3 months and [Gurufocus says it's still so cheap](https://www.gurufocus.com/stock/ACMR/summary) that either the market is \\[temporarily\\] insane or something must be off. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r27dk8jtk6lc1.png?width=966&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae55dedc199b443fd9532a78825589771cd8368c\n\nIt's literally trading **below** its Peter Lynch Earnings (look it up if you don't know - its a very simple heuristic for finding **price floor**, aka pricing purely on earnings and discounting growth promises)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4h22jiudm6lc1.png?width=1896&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d4d53e04e06ce9412776dcb2b70a2074c6fa06d\n\nOkay let's go deeper. \n\nThey were founded in California in 1998, with a Shanghai-based subsidiary created in 2005 that handles the majority of operations. The Chinese company substantially \\*is\\* the company, with the American part essentially handling sales for US customers. (Interestingly, the American company, valued at $1B, owns 80% of the Chinese company but its valued way higher, at $5B)\n\nThey're a manufacturer of key semiconductor fabrication equipment, in particular silicon wafer cleaning equipment. Glorified but hella expensive dishwashers. Which look like this:\n\n[no rinsing your dishes necessary](https://preview.redd.it/ax8pm2uhj6lc1.png?width=1256&format=png&auto=webp&s=8bd87b75987435331cdbe04f6783bc5a5289044f)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFinancials look solid. Steady 40%+ y/y growth. Some choppiness in the quarterly revenue (not shown), but thats to be expected for a long lead sale like equipment this expensive. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qk0feryyi6lc1.png?width=918&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd003af7938886cb140e71722312967dec3331de\n\nWith growth like that you'd expect (and should be willing to pay) for a much higher P/E than 19. Nothing wrong here. \n\nNext let's look at debt. Looks fine. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h704dqn8m6lc1.png?width=934&format=png&auto=webp&s=01cee39ea78d26bfbdb9d04325934bdbd772b94a\n\nEverything looks great...surely someone online has something bad to say about this company. I dug up and old short report from 2020 that didn't leave a mark. [JCAP did their best to bring this company down and couldn't land a blow.](https://www.jcapitalresearch.com/uploads/2/0/0/3/20032477/2020_10_07_acmr_1.pdf)\n\nOk, company looks solid. What are the current events that could drive price action? \n\n# Recent news\n\n1. In september, [showed a backlog of just under $1B](https://ir.acmrcsh.com/news-releases/news-release-details/acm-researchs-operating-subsidiary-acm-research-shanghai-4)\n2. at end of Q4, [raised their 2023 estimated earnings](https://ir.acmrcsh.com/news-releases/news-release-details/acm-research-updates-2023-revenue-outlook-and-provides-initial)\n3.

Other than the overblown \"china is dead\" narrative, this company has everything going for it. Earnings could be a catalyst, but either way this stock is set for a strong 6 months as American AI bubble cools for a bit, China is dead narrative dies, and money flows to Chinese semi/AI plays. \n\nEarnings are tomorrow.
