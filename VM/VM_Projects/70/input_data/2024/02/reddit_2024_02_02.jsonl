Though, low liquidity on the strangle makes it so I need to stick it out until expiry.

They were not \"tasty\" and were not ideal.  The generally accepted metrics are >70 IVR/>50 IV or, at the very least, >50 IV for single name.  I don't think META ever got there and should not have been held through earnings, let alone played as an earnings announcement volatility contraction play.

The March 15th 470 short straddle is paying 37.22, <10% of the strike price.  If the short straddle isn't paying enough for me, it is unlikely that a 25 delta short strangle would as a function of BPE.

Compare, HOOD, IVR/IV 75.9/68.7%.\n\nThe other thing that you'll notice is that underlyings with higher IV have equally delta'd strikes farther away from ATM than ones with lower IV, so there is arguably \"more room to be wrong.\"   Conversely, same delta'd strikes in higher IV underlyings pay more in premium as a function of either strike or buying power effect than lower IV ones, so your break evens are consequently wider of ATM (because you receive more in premium).\n\nMy general bet for earnings plays is that the underlying stays within ***2x*** the expected move (which implies use of a short strangle with 16 delta strikes).

Keep track of all credits received and any debits paid.  This is important for a number of reasons, not the least of which is your ability to know when you can potentially scratch the trade out.\n2. On side test, roll up the short put in the same expiry (you don't want to roll it out yet) to a delta that cuts the net delta of the position in half.  In this case, you should've rolled the short put up for a credit.  This reduces net delta directionality, improves side break evens, and consequently increases your chances to get out of the trade should price move back into the setup.  It also necessarily means that you're booking a realized gain for the short put (it's a small consolation, but it's something).  Using the delta of the 435 short call currently (-87), I probably would've almost immediately inverted the setup (rolled the short put ***past*** the short call because the short put strike that is half that delta would be at the 465 or 470 strike (the 38 and 45 delta respectively).  This would result in an inverted -435C/-465P or -435C/-470P, 35-wide inverted short strangle.  However, how far I would've inverted would've depended on how much I'd collected in credits up to that point.\n3. This is where the keeping track of total credits received comes in.  You do not want to invert to a width greater than total credits received, so if you've only collected 10.00 in credits, the most you want to invert in that expiry is to the -435C/-445P.\n4. Assuming price hasn't rolled back into the exact mid point of your setup such that you can scratch it out, or, at least, take less of a loser, you then want to roll the inverted setup out for duration (generally at 21 DTE), again, keeping track of total credits received.  Personally, I generally do not monkey with rolling to the weeklies and generally roll the setup \"as is\" (same strikes) and then continue to make adjustments as necessary, rolling out for duration again if it is necessary.  For example, if I'd inverted to the February 16th -435C/-465P, I'd probably have already rolled it out to the March 15th -435C/-465P, with my platform saying that I would've gotten a 10.17 at the mid to do that. \n5. At some point, you will want to look at uninverting the short strangle.   The ideal time for doing this is when price moves back between the short option strikes, so that you can uninvert to OTM.  For example, say I did invert to the -435C/-470P, at which point I'd collected 40.00 in credits with rolls up of the untested side, as well as rolls out for duration, and price has moved back to between the short option strikes.  I can now uninvert the setup for around a 35.00 debit (the width of the inversion), resulting in a -435P/-470C and still have collected a net of 5.00 in credits for the setup.  On occasion, I will go ahead and uninvert ***even if*** price has not moved back into between the short option strikes, just to have my tested side closer to ATM.  It seems like \"magic\" improving your tested strike that way, but it's just math.\n\nNo one enjoys working broken setups, but they generally start as oversized losers relative to winners, so I generally do not throw in the towel out of the box.  I work these for a couple cycles, looking to take a smaller loser than were I to have done nothing, with the ideal goal being to scratch them out.\n\nThere are a few segments at [tastylive.com](https://tastylive.com) on short strangle management, at what points to do an adjustment, by how much, and how to manage an inverted setup that are probably worth a look.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Hello, thank you for your detailed response, I have read it and took note.
