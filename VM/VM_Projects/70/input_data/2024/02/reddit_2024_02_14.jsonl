Having a well-defined trade plan with rules for profit target, stop loss, planned capital, any other signals/indicators you want to use to reduce risk. \n\n3. Reducing risk is much more important than making a profit. If you can have a positive year while the benchmark is down, it will be very hard for it to catch up. With selling option premium the most important thing to protect yourself against is tail risk. A lot of us have all heard “picking up penny’s in front of a steamroller”.
