(Yes, some hit and share their stories, which I suppose serves as a motivational tool for others to believe that they can do the same, yet, my suspicion is that most who have tried to \"get rich quick\" have, effectively, achieved the exact opposite). \n\nIf you're an investor, you're buying for the long term and letting solid management teams, technological waves and growth take hold. \n\nMicrosoft is a perfect example. In the mid-to-late 2000's, the stock was stagnant, with most people considering the company to be wasted money (that was when it was in the $29-$34 dollar per share range). Had you been a long term investor in the company, waited for their management team to put the wheels in motion, then, needless to say, you would have reaped a HUGE reward. \n\nMy advice: Stop reading analyst comments and do your own homework. Firstly, understand the companies you're interested in, balance sheets and income statements.
