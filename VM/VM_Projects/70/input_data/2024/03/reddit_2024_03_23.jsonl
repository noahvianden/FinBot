If there is no time limit then are you willing to accept that you might be deceiving yourself to an extent? \n\n\nThe message from Elon/Tesla will always be FSD is just round the corner because the valuation of the company depends on it. Elon said himself Tesla’s success or failure will depend on whether or not they achieve FSD. So knowing this, hypothetically if they know their current path can never lead to FSD they are not incentivised to tell us (however illegal this may be), but to keep selling the dream that is only a year away until some other company comes up with an AI breakthrough that they can clone and thereby justify their valuation.

Would people even be willing to do this? Would you, your extended family & friends do this? If not wouldn’t others have the same reasoning?

Would it make suddenly make them world beaters? No. Why would it be different for Tesla. Also, Uber face intense competition in this space, wouldn’t Tesla face it with Waymo and Cruise and then Waymo& Cruise clones in different countries? \n\nAdd to all of this Elon’s antics on X/Twitter causing irreparable damage to the brand.
