{"title": "Sector rotation after fed cuts? ", "selftext": "So right now we have seen explosion in big tech and semis, AI adjacent stocks which have already ran up considerably. It seems like a no brainer crowded trade. \nSMCI 20x, NVDA at almost 2 trillion market cap, other semis going to the moon.  But how are expected future returns now? \n\nDo you think other sectors such as fintech, growth, small caps, emerging markets etc, which have been left out will stand to benefit from lower interest rates? Given that investors would rotate and seek higher expected returns?(considering the overextended nature of the current big tech and semis rally)\n\nObviously the time to buy is before they run up (not after) or when they look unattractive (meta, pltr, 2022). \nThere was also a rotation of sorts in early 2022, when tech sector (including NVDA) crashed hard, and oil/energy stocks went up (but nobody wanted to touch them in 2021 because they're 'dinosaurs' and 'electric vehicles are the future').", "id": "1b5ah5r", "created_utc": 1709447538.0, "score": 63, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 74, "comments": [{"body": "Fintech bag holder checking in.

Basically, higher rates meant worse stock prices.\n\nBut what's happened in the last few years is that no body cares. I think it's partly that the game has changed, with everyone and their grandmother's dog just shoving their monthly paycheck into index funds, buying the dip, whatever. And I think it's also partly that there is so much money that the market doesn't know what to do with itself, so the tiniest dips are absolutely exploded out of like GME-style short squeezes. And it's not just that the present fad narrative of AI is excusing high valuations on tech names. Companies like COST, PG, KO, BA and most others are trading at silly valuations that make truly no sense if investors were actually buying companies.\n\nSo, to answer your question, I think the algos and idiot fund managers of the world will just do what they were taught in their textbooks, which is to buy utilities and REITs and small-cap growth when the Fed drops rates. To accomplish this, I expect some pull back in large cap for a short while.
