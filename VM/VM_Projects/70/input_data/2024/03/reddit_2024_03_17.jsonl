Profits are much better than buying OTM calls when a stonk moons. Said to myself Friday, Apple sure hasn‚Äôt done shit lately. I think it‚Äôs time. Loaded up on cheap ITM puts. Guess what happened? Somebody decided to exercise a shit fuck ton of puts that still had over 60 days to expiration. What I didn‚Äôt know was that my broker will only auto exercise the in the money long leg, if it‚Äôs at expiration. Woke up Saturday morning with 10,000 shares of Apple. Not necessarily a huge deal because I can just exercise the long leg myself and sell the shares back. My question from a fellow smooth brain is - Will I have to pay margin interest on the $2 million worth of Apple shares sitting in my account over the weekend?\n\nEdit: Yes, you pay margin for the shares. Today there was a margin sell order. Called the broker and they cancelled it on the condition that I sell the stock covered to collect the remaining value on the long leg. Worst case I exercise the long for the original $.05 loss.\n\nEdit 2: Td allowed the sale of the covered calls but they tried calling me and I missed the call so they closed the remaining contacts that I was offloading. At the end of the day, I think if apple opened up deeply red, it would have been better since the increase in IV would have made for better premiums.
