They made 150kw battery to fit in the station and be swappable. So idk about restricting themselves with that.\n\nSystem in China with battery swapping aint that great compared to european version I am not gonna lie on that. But I think, not sure but maybe they have been thinking about it more than some random redditor. If they have like 2k swapping stations, they might know it is smart thing to do. And in car buyers perspective its no brainer to buy a nio. With Tesla, ur battery is dead in 8 years. Want a new one? Drop 15 k to have a new one.

They did have one station at some weird location. And that point Tesla had sold only 100 k cars. So of course there was no demand for swapping if the only swapping station was at some resort outside of highways etc. I think back then swapping cost way more and Tesla did not have the money for it. Thats why they lost intrest in it. \n\nBy bad with the bad battery health, but you can‚Äôt deny that when its time to change the battery, it wont be cheap. BaaS would be really handy in that situation. Its easier to pay monthly fee about 70 bucks than replace the battery after 10-12 years. And pay 10k for new battery to already old car. \n\nWith standard range Tesla, 10 % decrease in range starts to feel in everyday use especially if you drive even bit longer to work or in use it in colder environments. \n\nNio has completed 40+million swaps already with only about 450 k cars on road. That sounds like it is working. Also, if you want make a Nio long range for a week, you can rent a 100kw or 150 kw battery. Sounds pretty nice to me. No need to spend money on long range car, if you dont need it everyday.\n\nNio has 8 billion dollars in cash, so Id say the changes with bankrupty are same as with Tesla in 2015. But they are still making money after they sell the car. With BaaS and their charging network. In fact, they make money even they dont sell a car. Around 80 % of Nio charger users are not Nio owners.

In ten years the battery cant be that good anymore.\n\nBut as you are an american, you live most likely single family home, or place where there is parking lot where you can charge. Because US is very autocentric and is it build that way. However, if you live in a bigger city, like LA, NYC, Seattle or some city like that It is way harder to charge your car at home. You may have not a solid place for your car. It is just randomly parked on diffrent parking lot or on a street. Then you need to charge it somewhere else, dont you think? Also, even though you are american, you cant say all 330 million americans think like you. Someone probably would love to have 10-15 k discont from the battery pack and rent it. And if they dont, they can also buy it. \n\nYou probably do not want to see Teslas losses from 2011 to 2019. It did not look good. Nios -5.59 billion net income is in RMB not in dollars.
