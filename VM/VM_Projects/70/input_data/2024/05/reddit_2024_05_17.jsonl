May 8th was down 26 cents and yesterday a whopping 92 cents. \n\nThe best part is QQQ has already run up in a straight line from 420 to 452 in 11-13 trading days it can't pullback an inch. For you guys that love the charts, the entirety of April's drop has already been made up and more. \n\nSo how exactly will this ever change? Hint it won't. The market is free to run up with no risk indefinitely. There won't be any real red days and if it happens the V will take care of it pretty fast.\n\nI don't care what happened in 2022. This is a very different  market where risk truly does not exist. NVDA reports next week and that will blast the Q's into the 460s. \n\nThere has never been a more risk free time in the market where there is actually no chance of this thing going down and many will miss it because of some ridiculous fear that doesn't exist in reality.
