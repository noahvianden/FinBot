{"title": "NVDA - competing narratives: Bubble Stock / Leading a Paradigm Shift", "selftext": "I bristle every time I hear another thought leader calling Nvidia a bubble stock. Just like in Scott Galloway’s recent post [https://www.profgalloway.com/bubble-ai/](https://www.profgalloway.com/bubble-ai/). I generally am aligned Scott’s view, but on this one he’s drinking too much of Aswath Damodaran’s bath water. These two are speaking of things they appear to have little understanding of.\n\nSo what defines a bubble?\n\nA stock bubble is generally understood as a run-up in stock price without a corresponding increase in the value of the businesses. A company's valuation should be determined by fundamentals -- its margins, profits, growth rate — the quality of earnings. In bubble stocks speculation and euphoria take over but there are no underlying fundamentals. Just like GME, or Tulips in the 1600s. It was the greater fool theory, everyone thought they could sell GME or prized Tulip bulbs at a price higher than they paid. \n\nI appreciate why people think Nvidia is in a bubble: There is hype and misunderstanding about AI every where you look, and it’s compounded by ignorant reporters or thought leaders. And Nvidia has also been a poster-child of previous boom/bust cycles as we know from the crypto gluts in 2018 and 2021. And, when confronted with some data, one regularly hears a sarcastically delivered, “sure, it’s different this time.”\n\nTo which I reply, just look at the quality of earnings. It IS different. No technology company has ever grown so quickly, at such scale and so profitably. In order for the hype theory to hold, you have to believe Nvidia is fooling the entire business world into believing the output of their chips are meaningless nonsense. But the largest companies in the world and significant government and research institutes are lined up for months to buy them.\n\nJensen Huang actually did build a better mouse trap.\n\nSemiconductors generally lead the broader US economy. They are the primary asset in a long chain of economic activity.\n\nWhat is so unusual about this cycle is that there is one primarily beneficiary. It’s baffling to watch the slow-motion development of the machine learning market since 2012 only to have it explode 2024, and not one of the other merchant semiconductor suppliers (Intel, AMD, Qualcomm, Marvell, Broadcom, Mediatek) nor the plethora of startups (Graphcore, Nirvana, Cerebrus, Mythic, Habana, SambaNova, Groq, Tenstorrent) nor huge technology giants like Google, Microsoft, Apple, Meta, Tencent, Alibaba, and Amazon can participate at a similar scale as Nvidia.\n\nNvidia has invented and is delivering a new kind of computing solution. And that solution will be refashioned to reshape business and economic opportunity for decades to come. And that will result in the simple creation of new gross domestic product: where there once was nothing, there is now something.\n\nNVDA is not a bubble, their earnings prove it.", "id": "1d2bkli", "created_utc": 1716872507.0, "score": 69, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 91, "comments": [{"body": "The situation is quite simple:\n\nGoogle is a pioneer in AI but Google has also a track record that they rather fool around instead of trying to monetize their great research results. Since Google Seach and YouTube have brought in the billions from ads there wasn't really a need either. So when OpenAI released ChatGPT, MS immediately recognized an opportunity. For the first time 20 years Google's domination on internet search could be challenged with an AI augmented search tool. Google realized the same thing so it's no surprise how quickly Google responded to GPT with Gemini. So what will happen is that MS and Google will spend billions in the race for the best AI search because one want to break the monopoly and the other will want to keep it.\n\nThe same is true for autonomous vehicles. It doesn't matter if Tesla is first or not. All automotive companies researching this will need to use AI in the end.\n\nYou can find countless more examples where companies get into strong FOMO because a competitor might use AI to improve their position and so it becomes a paranoia. The fight will be just to keep the current market share levels by improving services and products without actually creating much new. It's a fight to defend your current market position and if competition uses AI then you must do so as well.\n\nDoes it matter if the future of internet search will be with Google, with MS or with someone else? Does it matter if Tesla is first to Level 5 AV or someone else? Does it matter...?\n\nNO, because ALL OF THEM will need AI compute and will pay Nvidia one way or the other. That's why Nvidia is growing so much faster than any other company in this AI cycle. The reason is simple, potentially every company in the world could join the FOMO in the AI arms race. But the supply side is quite thin. Time is a critical speed factor. If Nvidia takes 3 months for training and competitors take more time then customers still rather wait for Nvidia solutions. If your competitor goes with Nvidia with an existing platform solution then you will consider Nvidia as well because choosing competition like AMD might increase risk of losing time while creating and stabilizing a platform as well as less performance (= more time needed).\n\nNvidia is the risk-free option for AI compute. You know what you get and you can get working on it immediately while waiting for your data center. You can start data aggregaton and framework learning with any Nvidia GPU in your company. With anyone else there is a lot of risks of no return of invested development time to get the platform as a whole to work and even then will the performance at scale be comeptitive?\n\nThis is also what we see. Nvidia is partnering with Fortune 500 companies while AMD & Co. is partnering with startups. The big money guys rather pay a premium for being fast to market than taking experiements. Startups however have small pockets so they have to watch costs more closely and appease investors by giving them more time.\n\nThe nice part is that Nvidia has no competition on the AI compute platform at scale while Nvidia is a partner to everyone who needs AI compute.\n\nYou can see that Nvidia focuses on this kind of relationsships in different areas:\n\n* Car companies are all competitors while all of them could technically partner with Nvidia DRIVE system\n* Pharma companies are all competitors while all of them could partner with Nvidia Clara and drug discovery platforms\n* Robotics companies are all competitors while all of them could use Nvidia Isaac as a partner\n* Manufacturing Automation companies are competitors while they could all use Nvidia Omniverse for their needs\n\nThe opportunity for Nvidia is beyond imaginable and it will grow. Many things are still small and take time to evolve but Nvidia is way more than a chip maker and platform provider, they even provide many tools for many industries. In the end several customers could become multiple partners with Nvidia. A robotics company might use Nvidia for AI compute and Isaac. An automotive company might use Nvidia AI compute for LLMs, DRIVE system (driving), Isaac (logistics) and Omniverse (manufacturing/prototyping).\n\nAnd the list goes on... I see the current Tech CapEx spending as the tip of the iceberg. Getting AI models into production is a complex field so that's why Tech has such a headstart but all the other industries will eventually also start investing AI substantially. Just the listed companies in the world have a revenue of >$100 trillion so if they spend 1% of their revenue in AI, we have a trillion AI market.", "score": 30, "replies": [{"body": "So its like the Goldrush and NVidia is selling the shovels?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "No, not gold rush with shovels.\n\nIt's more like the arms race in weapons during cold war and Nvidia being basically the arms dealer with the best weapons.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Googles cooked, they already lost the ai race with microsoft.

And then whatever crumbs are left (not much) will be divided amongst Amd, Intel and the host of AI startups.  But I don’t see any real competition. Even if their silicon is good, their software is not. And when the Sw is also good, the ecosystem is lacking. And by the time they have silicon, and Sw and an ecosystem - Nvidia will have new products that offer more value. \n\nTake Amd as an example- let’s assume the Mi300 is fantastic. Well - I can’t get any meaningful quantities till Q4. And there is a significant lead time to build silicon. So how many units will Amd place orders for in Q4?\n\nIf they order based on ‘commitments’ they have today - they will never out perform that amount. And when Blackwell comes out, customers will use Blackwell and abandon those commitments. And if Blackwell is delayed or has issues in some way, Amd can’t do better than the orders they have placed today. And if Amd bets it all and places orders for a huge amount of mi300x (well above current demand), and Blackwell is better than Mi300x, Amd is finished. So they will never take a huge risk. \n\nThe point is that the competition needs to bet the company or at least a lot on their silicon - in the face of a growing Nvidia. And if they don’t, it doesn’t matter how good they are. They will be capped by their own bets. \n\nJensen bet the company on this paradigm. And it’s paid off.

They are not deluded to thinking only they can supply the rest of the AI market.   Like console gaming, there are segments they prefer to leave others to service.\n\n>you are pretty much at the mercy of nvidia\n\nI don't agree.   A developer could use TPU or Gaudi or MI300 or Cerebrus or SambaNova.   You, as a developer, just have to be willing to take on the development tasks that allow those solutions to work.   And so you might look at a make or buy decision and choose Nvidia just simply for the time to market benefit or ease of use.   That's not Nvidia's fault, that's the competitor's fault for not offering a better alternative.  \n\n>there should be competition.\n\nI agree.   Where are they?   How are they executing on their designs?  How are they developing tools that are better or easier to use than CUDA?   How is their performance?  How are they going to leapfrog or even pull even with what Nvidia offers today let alone next gen?  How are they skating to where the puck will be?\n\nThis machine learning opportunity didn't come out of no where.   It's been slowly developing since 2012.  Everyone, Intel, AMD, QCOM, Apple, Meta, Google, all the startups saw it coming and have had plenty of runway to invest and offer a competitive products over the last 10 years.   Nvidia has just focused and executed better.   It's kind of sad that these once great companies seem to have lost their edge.\n\nThe question on competition in my mind is does Machine Learning end up going the same direction as PC Gaming where basically Nvidia executed better than anyone to the point everyone basically gives up and only 1 competitor was left?
