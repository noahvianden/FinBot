Take NVDA, great company, large moat on their technology as they're so ahead of the game. The problem is their size. NVDA is so massive that it's one of the most valuable company in the world, almost $2.5T, that means $250B in share have to be bought to raise the price a further 10%.\n\nAnd if you look around, NVDA is a stock on a lot of peoples' lips and while I don't think we've reached peak price saturation, but if you were looking for say a 20% profit, this company needs to find $500B in buyers before you can get there.\n\nAdditionally, due to the already high valuation the company can't make a mis-step or at least not much of one until you start seeing capital flight or at least stagnation (see APPL).\n\nWhat I'm ramblingly trying to say is, you could make money buying NVDA, but there is a lot of risk buying shares in a company which has had a huge run-up and now has a valuation so high you need a very large number of buyers to even move the needle.", "score": 4, "replies": []}, {"body": "You can‚Äôt batch up google, amazon and msft with nvidia.
