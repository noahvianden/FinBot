I have also worked at a Fortune 500, San Francisco Tech company that went through layoffs, but they were not the same place.\n\nThe first company had a management change, after some turmoil and overall missed targets. The President of the company fired the manager and stepped in to temporarily manage this location to get things back on track until they hired his replacement. He fired everybody at that location and made them interview for their jobs back.\n\nThe, non-shocking result, is that moral did not improve and that location remained a problem for the entirety of my tenure with the company (around 5 years). Worse, we all knew it and it spilled over to the rest of the business. A few years after I left the company, the president was fired by the board and the board sold to be absorbed by a larger company.\n\nI have also worked at a F500 SF tech company for around 10 years. We went through layoffs a few times and I have seen them handled in different ways. Attempts at Stack ranking, wholesale team cuts, early retirement offers, you name it. Morale is always impacted, but never anything like what I saw above. The more that the exec team allows direct managers to have involvement into the process is always better and the more forewarning also softens the blow.\n\nI have also seen people with specific domain knowledge let go, were it wasn't discovered until later that we lacked and needed their expertise. Reaching out to past employees, were you either get asked to offer a huge sum to help out, or you get laughed in your face. \n\nWhat Tesla is doing here is a terrible way to fire people and a terrible way to retain people and anybody that thinks this won't have negative consequences running the business of Tesla moving forward is frankly wrong here.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": ">Attempts at Stack ranking, wholesale team cuts, early retirement offers, you name it.\n\nSound a lot similar what has happened at my work place during layoffs. Management gets on the table with employee representative and they discuss posibilities how employees can go about the layoffs. Early retirement, unpaid vacation periods, taking vacation bonuses as extra vacation instead of money, not renewing temporary positions and reasigning people to open positions if able to are methods that are usually on the table and most of the time we are able to avoid half of the layoffs with these measures. Of course some will always get laid off in the end but people certainly feel better when they are given choices and option to find resolution to satisfy most. Even those that get laid off usually get open recommendation from company to help them finding a new job.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Yeah someone needs to do the work to install all those superchargers that Elon wants.
