I had mentioned in the previous thread I had developed a machine learning strategy with respect to absolute changes in the price of SPY and whether those would be useful to straddle/iron condor strategies. So I have three models now, one that predicts where SPY will move more than 1.5% at any point over the following 5 days (83.5% accurate), whether SPY will move more than 0.75% on any given day (i.e. 0DTE; 67.1% accurate) and whether SPY will close within 0.5% of its opening price on any given day (i.e. 0DTE; 77.9% accurate).\n\nThe first two models lend themselves to straddles which are relatively straight forward and my question is about the last model which would lend itself to an Iron Condor strategy.\n\nSay for instance, for the simplicity of calculation, that SPY is at 500.

For instance when constructing one for May 28th (assuming an opening price of $529.47 - price at the time of writing), I have the following set-up:\n\nBuy Put: SPY 524 @ $0.14  \nSell Put: SPY 526 @ $0.30  \nSell Call: SPY 533 @ $0.30  \nBuy Call:: SPY 535 @ $0.04\n\nWhich gives me a max profit of $24 ($21.60 after commissions), while risking $176.

Non-standard contracts have a severely limited market and may be treated as closing-only trades by your broker.\n\nSuffice to say, you don't want to hold contracts through an acquisition, or any other adjustment, if you can avoid it.\n\nFor specifically acquisitions, it depends on the terms of the acquisition and which side your contracts are on. If A is acquiring B and B will disappear and just be part of A going forward, and you have B calls, it will depend on whether it is a cash deal or a stock deal or both. In a cash deal, there is nothing for B calls to deliver after the deal is done, so all expirations are usually accelerated to the effective date of the adjustment. So your Jan 2026 LEAPS call might turn into a June 8 2024 call and instead of shares it will deliver some amount of cash.

The max profit on a credit spread is the opening credit, period. So if you open the NVAX spread for $.90, the max profit is $.90.\n\n>From my understanding, my spread will hit max profit when the underlying is at or above $15.\n\n*At expiration*. It could hit max profit at a different price point before expiration. And that would only be true of a **put spread**. You didn't say if it was a put or call spread.\n\n>Would anyone buy my spread if its ITM at all?\n\nYour question doesn't make sense. You *sold to open* the spread, because it is a credit spread. So clearly, somebody already bought it. Whether it goes ITM or OTM later is irrelevant.\n\n>It doesn't make sense to me that someone would spend lets say $200 on a spread that can make max $210 (I realise people could buy the options back to close their position)\n\nAgain, that ship has sailed, so this worry is for nothing. However, if you are asking in general why anyone would buy appreciated contracts that are ITM, the answer is, because they have value. Assets with value will always have a market. The only time you have to worry about there being no market for your position is when it is worthless or very near worthless. Shorts need to cover near expiration, even if for a loss, so some of the late game buyers are short sellers cutting losses. The rest are market makers who are compensated for trading contracts with value that no one else wants. MMs are not obligated to trade worthless contracts, so that goes back to my first point about the worthless case is the one to worry about.\n\n>If I go to exercise my spread (close my long call and buy back my short call)\n\nI'm glad you clarified what you meant, because that would not be properly called exercising a spread. That's closing a spread. Exercising would involve literally exercising the long leg.\n\n>If I go to exercise my spread (close my long call and buy back my short call) the difference between them is only $110. No where near $210 even if its in the money\n\nWell, as I've pointed out, the $210 is not your max profit, so this isn't really surprising. And BTW, it's better to keep all premium prices in per-share numbers. Since your spread is $2.50/share wide, the max profit has to be less than $2.50, which is why I guessed $.90.\n\n>I expected when the underlying hit $15 I could close out my positon\n\nYou could have closed out your spread for a profit much sooner than that. Suppose your opening credit was $.90 like I guessed. If the next day the net premium for the spread was $.85, you could close for a $.05 profit. Regardless of what the stock price was! It probably wouldn't be anywhere close to 15.\n\nFor all credit trades, the objective is to sell high and buy back low.

There are some exceptions, but it's not something you are going to run into on a day-to-day basis or do by accident.

I've used a margin account for my option trading for years and have closed hundreds of trades, without ever once borrowing money on margin.\n\nNow, all that said above, there is one gotcha that is *related* to margin borrowing. If you trade unsecured options short, that is, if you sell to open options you don't own in order to do credit trading, that involves a mechanism similar to margin borrowing. In fact, it's not possible to do short trading of unsecured options without using a margin account. So if you want to trade something like a vertical credit spread, you'd need a margin account. I won'd go into all the details of how shorting options works and how **initial margin requirements** and **maintenance margin** work for short option trades, you can do your own research on those terms, but suffice to say that you *can* get into trouble if you leverage your short trading too much.

{"title": "Bearish Case for NVDA Before Earnings: A WSB DD Special", "selftext": "Alright, fellow degenerates, it's time to talk about why NVDA might just take a nosedive this earnings season. Grab your tendies and buckle up, 'cause we're diving into the bearish case for this chip giant. 🐻\n\n**1. Valuation is Through the Roof 🚀🔫**\n\nLet's face it, NVDA has been on a moon mission lately. The stock is trading at sky-high multiples that make even the most optimistic bulls sweat. With a P/E ratio over 75, we're looking at a company that's priced for perfection. Any hiccup in their earnings report could send this overvalued rocket crashing back to earth.\n\n**2. AI Hype Bubble Ready to Burst 🤖💥**\n\nYeah, yeah, AI is the future and NVDA is leading the charge with their GPUs. But here's the thing: the hype train might be running out of steam. We've seen this story before with other tech darlings. If NVDA doesn't deliver mind-blowing growth in their AI market, expect a massive reality check. Remember, hype can only carry a stock so far before fundamentals need to catch up.\n\n**3. Competition Heating Up 🔥🔥**\n\nNVDA isn't the only player in the game anymore. AMD is snapping at their heels with competitive products, and let's not forget about Intel trying to make a comeback. Increased competition means NVDA's market share could take a hit, leading to slower growth and tighter margins. Wall Street won't be kind if NVDA's dominance starts to wane.\n\n**4. Supply Chain Woes Continue 🚢🛑**\n\nGlobal supply chain issues are still a thing, folks. NVDA has managed to navigate these waters better than most, but they're not immune. Any disruption or increase in costs could squeeze their margins. Plus, with the semiconductor shortage showing no signs of easing up, there's a real risk that NVDA's production and delivery timelines could be impacted.\n\n**5. Macro Environment is a Wild Card 🎢📉**\n\nWe're living in uncertain times. Inflation, interest rates, geopolitical tensions – you name it. All these macro factors could weigh on NVDA's performance. Higher interest rates, for example, could hit tech stocks hard as investors rotate into safer, income-generating assets. If the broader market takes a hit, you can bet NVDA will feel the pain too.\n\n**6. Insider Selling 🤑👋**\n\nAlways follow the money, my dudes. Recently, we've seen significant insider selling at NVDA. While insiders sell for many reasons, it doesn't exactly scream confidence when top execs are cashing out at these levels. It could be a sign that they think the stock is peaking.\n\n**Conclusion: Risky Business 🚀🔫**\n\nTo wrap it up, NVDA is facing a perfect storm of high valuation, competition, supply chain issues, and macroeconomic uncertainties. This earnings season could be a rude awakening for those who think NVDA can only go up. Stay cautious, my fellow apes, and remember: bulls make money, bears make money, but pigs get slaughtered. 🐂🐻🐷\n\n**TL;DR: NVDA's valuation is sky-high, AI hype might fizzle, competition is fierce, supply chain issues persist, macro environment is unstable, and insiders are selling. Be cautious before earnings.**\n\n*Disclaimer: This is not financial advice.
