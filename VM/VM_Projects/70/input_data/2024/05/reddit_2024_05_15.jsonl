{"title": "The $BB DD You Should Probably See Before Buying", "selftext": "Someone recently posted their $BB yolo yesterday, and that piqued my interest again in the stock. Most people remember BB as the dominant cellphone of the 2000s before Steve Jobs and his pancreas released the iPhone. BB phones were practical, resilient, and most importantly *secure* for a device of that era.\n\nSo like a bitch in heat, I passionately purchased calls earlier today. But soon thereafter, buyer's regret took a hold of me after sifting through $BB 10-Ks and old DD. I compared some data between competitors, and **soon realized how much of a shitshow this stock currently is.**\n\n**2021: Bad - No offense to the guys that made $BB DD in the past, but it was all pure speculation, probably so that the highly esteemed** ***ritards*** **of WSB would buy their bags.**\n\n* Pros: Very high short interest, nice lemon squeezy; plus tons of business potential with their tech in the EV sectors, IOT, and Cybersecurity.\n* Cons: BB had practically no revenue growth; bad financials; an exciting deal with Amazon whittled away to nothing. \n\n**2024: Slightly less bad, still not worth buying without chance of short squeeze**\n\n* Pros: Less debt, stronger sales and resilience in cybersecurity; sales strategies starting to look promising; meme buzz\n* Cons: Flat revenue growth, difficult financials; **much less short interest, 8% so no squeeze likely**; customer dissatisfaction/stronger competition\n\n**Financial:** I created a spreadsheet to calculate data pulled manually from 10-Ks to compare past years numbers, but figured this would be too much to add to the post and frankly it's a lot of extra work than needed. I know most of you would just skip over the numbers.\n\nBB been spending tons in R&D in past years, and this has taken chunks of what would be juicy profits. Now in what seems like a move to gain interest from investors, they are making cost cuts to improve financials. This could mean falling behind in tech advantage to larger companies like MSFT.\n\n* Total revenue was up $853mil (2024) vs. $656mil (2023) from last year, but still down from 2020 and 2021\n* Net income (money that you take home) was negative 3 out of the 4 last years (due to very high operating expenses)\n\n|YEAR|2021|2022|2023|2024|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Net income**|**-$1.1bil**|**$12mil**|**-$130mil**|**-$734mil**|\n\n* Debt slashed by 45%, and traded for longer term repayment, but with higher interest rates.\n\n**Technology:** Competition in this sector is *ROUGH*... tons of different endpoint management and security products out there... including Microsoft, Cisco, and Google. Cybersecurity companies such as CrowdStrike, Palo Alto and IBM, make it difficult for BB to get their foot in the door. Not to mention there's tons of posts from actual IT/Security folk on reddit that have moved away or avoided using Cyclance, BB's security platform.\n\n[Why is Cylance doing so poorly Business Wise compared to Crowdstrike, Palo Alto, Microsoft etc. : ](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/18o9ksn/why_is_cylance_doing_so_poorly_business_wise/)\n\n[Is Cylance I‚Äôm still a thing in 2021+? : ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cylance/comments/kbj08e/is_cylance_im_still_a_thing_in_2021/)\n\n[Endpoint protection options : ](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/ps2yeh/endpoint_protection_options/)\n\n**Buzz:** Only way in short term that BB price will drive up is if retail buys a fuck ton, and while the cheap price is appealing, the other meme stocks are more attractive.\n\nIn conclusion, I regret my financial decision to buy calls and hope this will help others make better decisions than me.\n\n# TL;DR: $BB is not worth your money unless you like pain.", "id": "1csbwfg", "created_utc": 1715745686.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.47, "num_comments": 70, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 1 | **First Seen In WSB** | 3 years ago\n**Total Comments** | 105 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 3 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Ive been holding my $BB since 2021 :(", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "So‚Ä¶buy?", "score": 122, "replies": [{"body": "I ran this post through ChatGPT 4o and that‚Äôs what the lady said", "score": 21, "replies": []}, {"body": "That's what I'm doing.
