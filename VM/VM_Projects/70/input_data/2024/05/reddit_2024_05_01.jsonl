Can you imagine if all gas stations in the US are all chevron? \nTo make a better comparison imagine Nvidia being the provider and the only one that provides cloud services for AI. Which is not the case. They just sell hardware to Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and all other cloud providers.   So Tesla will only focus on tech, and allow for other companies to provide the service.\n- Another redditor posted how insanely difficult is to know regulations in a place like California. Doing that for the whole world is ridiculously inefficient.   Specially when you gotta be the middle man between the utility company, and the owner.

Depends, but it there aren't many holes left and those can be built out more gradually which would save capex, EV sales are also slowing down in general so there won't be as much demand from other carmakers. So they slow down the build out of new locations and focus on expanding current sites, many of which are too small. Should make the paperwork simpler and quicker so you don't need as many paper-pushers/people dealing with bureaucracy (as this was what the supercharger infrastructure team was actually doing, they weren't designing supercharger hardware).\n\nOkay, so maybe we just need half of the division, but turns out (this is speculation but doesn't seem too far off) the director of the division isn't willing to cut half of the staff.

I have the impression that V4 builds have been quite slow, not all of the locations were perhaps that good (so basically kind of inflating the number of locations by just building them somewhere) but I kind of doubt this was the actual reason.
