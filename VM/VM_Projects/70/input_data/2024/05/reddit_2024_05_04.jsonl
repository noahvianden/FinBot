{"title": "My sad options story", "selftext": "I‚Äôm sure every options trader has one. Mine started yesterday with AMD. I always advise when buying and selling options, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be greedy‚Äù. Options can turn on you quickly. I buy 10 at a time and once I‚Äôm up 10 cents, which equals $100, I‚Äôm setting a stop loss to lock it in. If the price keeps moving up, I‚Äôll move up the stop loss. Ok. So yesterday around 10 am or so I bought 10 options on AMD. AMD loves to open high and then drop big between 9:30-10 and then recover. It did that. I guessed wrong on the low point and it dropped further. I bought 10 more for an average of $.58. Strike was $147. Expired today. AMD made a run and I ended up setting a stop loss at $.70 to lock in a nice $240 profit. It was up around $.75 at the time. Unfortunately after a minute it triggered my stop and that was that. I was traveling at the time, so I didn‚Äôt bother to do anything else. Well, AMD then continued it rise through the day yesterday as well as today and closed today at $150.60. That 20 options at $.58 turned into somewhere around $3.50.
