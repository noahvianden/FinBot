Then 2018 came along and destroyed it.  And it seemed impossible to get it back on track.  Then we've had the hyper growth of the last year or so.   Point is, these things aren't predictable.  \n\nCouple of comments 1.  Ascending margins are going to be hard, I don't think that's a good assumption.   If they can normalize in the low 70s that will be huge, but I am generally more conservative on topics like this and tend err to the low side, maybe 70 (or 68) is a better planning sort of number   2.  Automotive is growing too slowly imo  I think we will start to see a better pickup this year.   3.  Linear growth is fine to build a model with, but it's not going to be close to accurate.  And does something like gaming just grow in regular steps to the moon?   4.  I like your optimism with ProVis/Omniverse.  5. Your best visibility is into the next quarter due to their guide, and I think that looks about right (I think they will do $30), but from there on out, you will need to, which I'm sure you understand, refresh your entire model every Q.\n\nAGI may be the goal, but there is going to be a lot of time between then and now.\n\nGlad to see someone doing this.

This is the response:\n\nThe graphic presents a detailed projection of Nvidia's financial performance from Q4 2023 to Q4 2027, breaking down revenues by segment, operating margins, net income, and earnings per share (EPS). Here are some key observations and insights:\n\n### Revenue Growth\n1. **Datacenter**: This segment shows the most significant growth, increasing from $18.4 billion in Q4 2023 to $105.1 billion by Q4 2027. This is indicative of Nvidia's strong positioning in the AI and data center markets.\n2. **Gaming**: This segment also grows steadily but at a slower pace, from $2.9 billion in Q4 2023 to $3.8 billion in Q4 2027.\n3. **Professional Visualization**: This area is expanding, from $463 million in Q1 2024 to $1.3 billion by Q4 2027.\n4. **Automotive**: Growth here is more modest but consistent, rising from $281 million in Q1 2024 to $536 million by Q4 2027.\n5. **OEM & IP**: This segment remains relatively flat, hovering around the $78 million mark by the end of the projection period.\n\n### Financial Metrics\n1. **Total Sales**: Nvidia's total sales are expected to grow significantly, from $22.1 billion in Q4 2023 to $110.8 billion in Q4 2027.\n2. **Operating Margin**: Operating margins are projected to improve slightly, from 70% in Q1 2024 to 75% by Q4 2027, indicating enhanced operational efficiency.\n3. **Net Income**: There is a dramatic increase in net income from $7.6 billion in Q4 2023 to $58.9 billion by Q4 2027, reflecting robust profitability.\n\n### Earnings and Valuation\n1. **EPS**: Earnings per share are forecasted to grow significantly, from $6.12 in Q4 2023 to $31.43 by Q4 2027. This sharp increase suggests substantial value creation for shareholders.\n2. **Stock Price**: The stock price projection shows a significant rise, from $1,056.74 at the end of 2024 to $3,199.95 by the end of 2027, based on an expanding EPS and a relatively stable P/E multiple.\n\n### Overall Insights\n- **Growth Drivers**: The primary growth driver appears to be the datacenter segment, underpinned by increasing demand for AI and cloud services.\n- **Market Position**: Nvidia's strong position in key growth markets like AI, gaming, and data centers is likely to propel its revenue and profitability.\n- **Operational Efficiency**: Improved operating margins suggest better cost management and economies of scale.\n- **Valuation**: The stock price projections are aggressive but align with the expected substantial growth in revenue and earnings.\n\n### Potential Risks\n- **Market Dependence**: Heavy reliance on the datacenter segment might pose risks if market conditions change or competition intensifies.\n- **Technological Shifts**: Rapid technological advancements could disrupt current projections if Nvidia fails to innovate continuously.\n- **Economic Factors**: Global economic fluctuations, such as inflation or recession, could impact spending on technology and data centers.\n\nIn conclusion, Nvidia's projected financials indicate robust growth across multiple segments, leading to significant increases in sales, margins, and stock price. The datacenter segment is a critical driver, and the company's ability to maintain high operating margins and profitability bodes well for its future. However, potential risks related to market dependence and economic conditions should be monitored.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "This argument gets used a lot.

I'm sure *no one* will complain about a measure that includes only water, bread, and housing.

Saying that it measures relative to a declining standard of living is an opinion, not a fact; a factually incorrect opinion, as it happens.\n\nYour third suggestion is amazing as well.
