The chip designer doubled its market cap in less than nine months. The boom in generative artificial intelligence means demand for Nvidia chips still exceeds supply. But hitting the $3tn milestone is proving more difficult. To some investors, AI hype has inflated valuations beyond reason. Michael Burry, whose short against the housing market was made famous in The Big Short, bet against semiconductor stocks last year. Cathie Wood‚Äôs Ark Invest dropped Nvidia in early 2023, claiming the market was pricing in too much optimism. Yet compare Nvidia‚Äôs position with the company‚Äôs own market history and its valuation does not look stretched. The stock trades at 35 times expected earnings, down from 55 times at the start of 2022. Considering the size of its potential market and the pricing power it wields, Nvidia has a shot at becoming the most valuable stock in the US. Those concerned by Nvidia‚Äôs valuation point to the advances made by Google‚Äôs TPU, AMD‚Äôs MI300X and other would-be rivals. But Nvidia has two advantages: a head start and a closed ecosystem. It created its graphics processing units (GPUs) as processors for computer graphics. They turned out to be perfect for the huge calculations needed to train large language models for generative AI. Rivals are constrained by the lack of semiconductor fabrication plants needed to assemble new high-powered chips. These take years and tens of billions of dollars to build. Nvidia also offers a one-stop shop for customers via its CUDA platform, which enables them to use programmes that run on Nvidia chips. One comparison might be Apple, which creates software that runs on its own hardware. Combined, these help Nvidia to dominate the AI chip market and set its own prices. The company‚Äôs gross margins have jumped from 65 per cent to nearly 73 per cent in the space of two years. Compare that with Intel, where margins are 41 per cent. Or AMD‚Äôs 51 per cent. Column chart of Gross profit margins (%) showing Nvidia's profit margin growth outpaces rivals Sales could continue to jump. Training LLMs requires large numbers of GPUs. So does the next stage of generative AI use: inference. The market for processing generative AI requests like videos, images and text could be far larger than the market for training the models. Nvidia‚Äôs latest chip, the Blackwell B200 GPU, processes these 30 times more quickly than its last chip.

AI is going to mean more data centers with more high end chips.\n\n3. NVDA sells those chips and the supply is far below the demand. That isnt changing today, tomorrow, or probably in the next 5 years. The main issue is that the demand from the top tier customers cant be satiated when newer more powerful chips hit the market before the current supply demand balance is reached.\n\n4. Competitors do exist in the sense that they exist in a sector and technically there are companies who also make chips. Reality is that the market price for NVDA has moved more in a few months than the entire valuation for AMD their chief \"competitor\". Im not saying the competition cant catch up, but it wont be during this cycle. I can see AMD or another chip maker catching up in 5-10 years primarily because NVDA doesn't actually make their own chips. When the contracts NVDA has with Taiwan semi are up for renewal who wants to bet that the terms are more favorable to Taiwan semiconductors? If a those contracts come up for renewal and a competitor has a viable chip to compete with its reasonable to expect that NVDA customers might fund that just to drive down margins. The winner from that kind of thing might be Taiwan semiconductors. \n\nEnd of the day I believe NVDA will be the dominate chip maker for the next 20-30 years. I dont think they will maintain their current margins over that period of time by any stretch. I think competition will become a real thing over that period of time, but NVDA will either be first place over that period of time or it will be one of the top 2 or 3.

There were some discussions I came across where analysts were trying to figure out if NVDA was buying up all that production capacity because they needed it or because they were trying to block competitors. It definitely seems like NVDA needed it more than it being an attempt to block competition. \n\nThat is a major reason why I think this AI boom is here to stay. NVDA appears to have needed all the top quality production capacity and that capacity limitation is the main bottleneck. It will eventually become a situation where demand eases or the capacity increases to meet the demand just like in every market. Funny thing. The TSM people are building more capacity which strongly suggests they thing they will get orders to fill that capacity for quite some time. \n\nIf you really want to go down the rabbit hole on this dont just track NVDA and TSM. You also need to keep up with what is happening at ASML. They provide the machines that TSM uses as the core of their production. A full life cycle for AI is probably something like MSFT, AMZN, GOOGL, and AAPL buy AI chips for their needs from NVDA. NVDA has them built by TSM. If TSM wants more capacity they need to buy more machines from ASML. Each of them can provide you with better understanding of what is going on, but please remember that there is a significant delay involved with some of their activities. TSM for example doesnt need to actually buy machines from ASML until they have a plant to put them in. NVDA might receive orders for a bunch of stuff but they wont actually deliver until its built.

Do you want them run by a data center hundreds of miles away or a data center in town with less latency? The difference might seem minor, but it could be a real issue. I suspect that a lot of the automation will be done in some combination of onboard processing power and communicating to a central system for more intense calculations. If those intense calculations come with a noticeable pause there will be a drive to reduce that substantially. Part of that will almost certainly be to put more processing power closer to the drones. \n\nYou might say that day is a long long ways off. You might be right, but if you are a company managing data centers you likely have someone thinking about things 10-20 years out and this is certainly something they are considering. \n\nWe are likely going to have automated vehicles driving around our towns one day.

The companies competing for revenue in the data center market would be wise to consider that.
