{"title": "Backtesting the \"112\" strategy", "selftext": "I was curious to backtest this strategy and how it holds up against other various net-long and semi-hedged strategies. \n\nI tested it with SPY, 60 DTE, exit at 30 DTE (+1) 25 delta, (-1) 20 delta, (-2) 7 delta puts. The duration was Jan 1, 2022 to May 7, 2024, roughly the last 2.5 years. \n\nAlso tested were several other strategies (all SPY), all the same duration entered at 60 DTE, exit at 30 DTE. They are: a 25 delta strangle, a 25 delta risk reversal, a 25 delta short put, a 75 delta long call. All tests are a 15% portfolio allocation, daily entry.\n\nBuying and holding SPY over this time period would have returned **8%**.\n\n**\"112\": 13.9% CAGR, -6.8% max drawdown, 97.9% win rate**\n\n**25 delta short put: 38.3% CAGR, -32.8% max drawdown, 78.1% win rate**\n\n**25 delta risk reversal: 27.1% CAGR, -44.2% max drawdown, 63.3% win rate**\n\n**25 delta strangle: 41.4% CAGR, -24.5% max drawdown, 69.5% win rate**\n\n**75 delta long call: -75.5% CAGR, -96.5% max drawdown, 31.3% win rate**\n\nMy biggest question was, \"how does this compare to simply selling a short put? The answer is apparently, not very well. You'd have been better off, even through the 2022 bear market, however mild it was.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the long call strategy was obliterated in 2022. The \"112\" strategy offered some nice downside protection and a high win rate. It did however, under perform every other strategy, aside from buying an ITM call.\n\nJust in case this was an anomaly in terms of the timeframe, I tested these against a 2.5 year period, leading up to 2020. The results are below. The duration is June 1, 2017 to Dec. 31, 2019.\n\nBuying and holding SPY over this time would have returned **24.84%**.\n\n**\"112\": 7.6% CAGR, -14.2% max drawdown, 97.9% win rate**\n\n**25 delta short put: 34.9% CAGR, -45.3% max drawdown, 79.8% win rate**\n\n**25 delta risk reversal: 56.5% CAGR, -42.5% max drawdown, 67.8% win rate**\n\n**25 delta strangle: 9.4% CAGR, -40.3% max drawdown, 59.5% win rate**\n\n**75 delta long call: 29% CAGR, -94.6% max drawdown, 63.8% win rate**\n\nThe \"112\" had a lower return than buy and hold over this period and yielded lower returns than any other strategy. It has the lowest max drawdown of any of the tested strategies, however, these are unmanaged tests. \n\nThe strangle is the poorest test in comparison with real world, because the management can make or break it. Additionally, something like a straight long call strategy will almost always have some kind of stop loss, in a real world trade. \n\nI was just curious because people talk about this so much. I guess you conclude that if you're looking for a low-returning, extremely conservative strategy that underperforms pretty much everything, the \"112\" is perfect.
