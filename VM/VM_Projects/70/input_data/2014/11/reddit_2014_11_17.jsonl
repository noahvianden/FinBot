Oil. and this might sound stupid as down oil is great for the economy (it is I don't disagree with this) but shale oil has been funded via hundreds of billions possibly even a trillion worth of debt all that needs $90-$100 oil to allow those who took out the loans to pay back. Remember sub prime.. No one thought the home prices were going to go down in value. No one thought oil would go down in value... \n\n2. Emerging market debt, like oil a ton of debt has been issued. Like oil this debt is based on artificially low rates based off the 10 year. As the dollar strengthens the emerging market currencies will go down in value and their economies will be forced to combat this and raise rates. This debt which didn't price in the real risk will also be another possible one to default. \n\nLong and short we have issued an absurd amount of debt all based on the low fed funds rate, and the market has sought yield as there is none in treasuries. We are back to 2007-08 again.. \n\nThe oil bubble is what really scares me as the oil market is starting to pop. \n\nYou can look at what is going on in Japan and the quantitative easing they announced which made the markets rally did nothing to stop them from entering into a recession. \n\nPlease Please be very conservative and consider cash or other very conservative investment positions, and consider buying puts to protect that position. \n\nI could be very wrong, and timing matters on this which I also could be wrong on...
