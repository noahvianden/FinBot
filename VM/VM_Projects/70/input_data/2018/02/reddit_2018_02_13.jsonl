You should spend a lesser amount renting than buying since ownership is relinquished after the month.  \nedit: I also thought of another reason why its better to buy.  Suppose you finish paying your mortgage.  Student loans rape people with high interest rates.  One way around that is to take out a line of credit and when you get a high enough payment (due to variable rate keep on going up) convert to a mortgage and use the equity as a student loan.  You cant do that if you rent.  Meanwhile you are paying the rent plus loans.
