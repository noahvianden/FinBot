If you look into their product road map it is pretty solid. AMD has a wide diversification of income with being in gaming platforms XBOX, PS4, and soon to be ATARI when it releases. The Vega GPUs are also in Apple iMac Pros. There is an Intel/AMD hybrid chip that houses AMD Vega graphics. AMD also just released their own version solution for value gaming with their own combo chip called the 2400G and 2200G. Last week, AMD also released their new AMD embedded processors for RYZEN and EPYC, which is a market around 15 billion dollars. Eypc is also starting to sell this quarter and will likely gain big traction in the server market, which is huge. \n\nAlso, if you take a look at the market cap of AMD it sits at 11.5 billion, which is extremely tiny compared to others such as NVDA(150b) and INTC(223B). They are working on paying off their past debt, which is now considerably better sitting at 1.4 B debt and holding 1.19B in cash.

If AMD expand rapidly that will create excess industry capacity. Also Intel used illegal antitrust means to maintain market share.  When Intel catch up in its architecture, together with the fab technology lead, AMD is struggle to survive.\n\nNow is the turning point.  AMD is posed to make a much bigger damage to Intel this time.\n\nAs seen from first gen Ryzen, AMD does have quite decent architecture despite Globalfoundries still lag behind Intel in fab process tech.  \n\nAlso, Intel is having serious issue on its 10nm process.  If industry rumor is correct, Intel's 10nm+ icelake in 2019 will only have the same performance as 14nm++ coffee lake in 2017.  Meanwhile 2019 Ryzen will migrate to 7nm with 40%+ performance improvement than 14nm Ryzen.  By 2019, AMD's CPU should have significant performance lead over Intel in both single thread and multithread performance. As the performance leader, AMD can charge a much higher margin.  Intel can only compete by cutting price and eating into its existing brand equity.\n\nWhat's interesting is AMD can now fab at both TSMC and GF, and potentially also Samsung if they want to.  TSMC/GF/Samsung together now has a much higher capacity than Intel. Which means if there is demand, AMD can ramp up production rapidly to fulfill the demand.  \n\nThe only possible thing for Intel to fight back is to gain back the fab technology edge.  However,  Intel used to have a 1.5 generation lead over TSMC/Samsung 5 years back, but lose its edge rapidly within the past 5 years.  I dont see why Intel can regain tech edge in fab. \n\nMaintaining fab edge is very expensive.  In 15 years ago Intel was a dominant player in Semiconductor industry, hence they can maintain an edge in fab. Now Intel Fab is smaller than TSMC/Samsung. Hence it's no longer economically efficient for them to maintain its own fab.\n\nSo in the next few years you will see Intel struggle like AMD did in 2008-2015: struggle to deliver a decent product using an inferior fab process. Eventually Intel will struggle to maintain a decent utilization for its fab and have no capital to update its fab.  Only way for Intel to survive is to spin off its fab like AMD does.\n\nIn mean time, as AMD shareholder, we will see a rapid market share gain, margin expansion while using little capital.  In this case, it's possible to see AMD up 10-15 fold in 5 years.\n\nOn GPU side, because AMD was struggle to survive in the past few years, they under invested in Radeon. Hence nVidia is able to gain market share and increase margin like crazy.  NVidia's main advanage is in software: Gameworks and CUDA. With increased earning from CPU, AMD is now hiring lots of software people for its GPUOpen and ROCm open source initiatives.  With ROCm version of Tensorflow ready soon, the advantage of nVidia in AI space will narrow.  Tesla AI chip rumor also show AMD's potential offering in AI space\n\nCurrently the biggest issue for AMD is the cryptocurrency exposure. There is not much means for institutionals to bet against crypto and nVidia is regarded as owning future of AI so investors short AMD to bet against crypto. Miners also prefer AMD GPUs over nVidia, hence gamers cant buy AMD GPUs and increased nVidia's Gaming market share. Short interest increased over the past year despite solid execution, hence share price does not move.  \n\nIn worst case, AMD may lose a few % revenue if crypto crash.  But I think market overestimate the negative impact as most investor assume no gamers want AMD cards and only miners buying AMD cards, but in fact gamers will take up some demand in particular if Vega is back to MSRP.  In case crypto crush but AMD still can able to deliver ok-ish result, there will be a massive short squeeze\n", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Given Samsung produces both advanced processors and high bandwidth memory I'm surprised they havent bought AMD.
