Most existing users who have had iphones for many years area already subscribed and have bought the apps that they wish to buy.

What am I missing?  I want to hold on to my Apple stock but I am targetting growth and I just don't see where it will come from.  To go further apple does not even try to push selling watches or airpods in my opinion (watch is still ugly and airpods don't have good sound quality or stay in a lot of users ears).   They should offer bundles with the new phones when they are released.  They should have also branded the beats headphones with apple logos all over them.

That 9-5 mac article said 67% of service revenue came from App Store and more than 70% of that portion is from gaming. Nonetheless a big portion. That means gaming makes up around 46%. Apple needs to make a bigger move into gaming. That iPad processor is very very good. Nothing comes close when creating an ARM based architecture chip. I hope that they create something similar to Nintendo switch with their iPad. Maybe a partnership because it’s only a matter of time until Apple’s mobile chips catch up to consoles or reach a point that is acceptable.
