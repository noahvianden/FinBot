I don't know enough to tell you when to time the market, but none of these people know more than just buying into Warren Buffet's philosophy that Warren Buffet doesn't even adhere to. Look at SP500 historically. There was a recession in 2001-2002, and another that started building up in 2007 (the peak before 2009). If you had stayed from the top of 2000 until the top of 2007, you would have made a 2 % gain, which is pathetic, and doens't even beat inflation. \n\nThey say in here that most people who sold didn't make their money back. Well that's due to people taking their money out too late and investing back in too late. In other words, laziness. ", "score": 0, "replies": []}]}

I know how annoying a bad/useless bot can be. I think I would remove some information or add spoilers so it doesn't take up as much space as it did before (but spoilers don't work well on mobile), so I figure I would ask here first.\n\nIs there a demand for this?
