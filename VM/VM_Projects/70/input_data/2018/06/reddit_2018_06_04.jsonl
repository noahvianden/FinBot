Servers will feature and allow Linux command lines. Azure already offers Linux as a platform and is partially using Linux to run Azure itself. SQL is also supporting Linux now. Even Microsoft professional certifications now cater to Linux. Linux and Microsoft have been cuddling together for some time now. And this acquisition just solidifies the cuddle more. They may lose the big ego Linux guys who are appalled by this... but that's not their target anyways, no changing that. Their target is the young guys who want to make money in the cloud industry of today using Azure and other Microsoft platforms that are growing by 80\\-120&#37; each quarter. This is a boon for that.
