{"title": "AMC is a Tendie Making Machine", "selftext": "Background:\nThe movie schedule of the summer of 2017 was absolute garbage, leading to a horrible quarter.  This blip of under performance led to analysts hyperventilating with \"millennials are killing movies with their avocado toast!!!\" hyperbole.  This stupidity caused AMC stock price to crash.  \n\nReality is that the movie industry is doing well.  Good movies have led to better attendance, higher ticket prices, and increased revenues.  The industry is crushing it for 2018 https://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/?view2=ytdcompare&view=releasedate&p=.htm \n\nAMC has spent a lot of cash flow in buying Carmike theaters, expanding overseas, and improving existing theaters with renovations that directly increase sales.  These investments will pay off big time in the future.\n\nTheir movie subscription service A-List already has 260,000 customers.  They were able to use the data of Movie Pass customers to create a price point for their service that isn't retarded.  At $20 a month, an A-List customer can go to 36 movies in a year and AMC will break even.  If they buy a bag of popcorn, AMC is back into profit with that customer.  Compare that to Movie Pass, where the break even point was only 12 movies in a year.  There should be a surge in A-List customers, leading to a surge in AMC stock price.\n\nMy measly pile of AMC stock: https://imgur.com/5IUmeeY", "id": "99diit", "created_utc": 1534945917.0, "score": 97, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 64, "comments": [{"body": "Where's our boy Carter from Georgia", "score": 88, "replies": [{"body": "probably rolling his hookers in a kiddie pool of fake butter", "score": 37, "replies": []}, {"body": "We need Marty to go on and pump MU", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "Spotted at Cheetah this morning eating tendies for breakfast.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "They've got pretty good food at the Cheetah actually.
