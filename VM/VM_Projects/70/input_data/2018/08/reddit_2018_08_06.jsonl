{"title": "Covered Calls Income", "selftext": "Alright guys, I’ve lost about 3k buying calls and puts ($BAC, $AMAT, $DRI, $JD, $YY), so I’ve decided I’m going to be selling them from now and on. I will be posting my covered call trades, and posting how much I make/lose.\n\nFor all of us who YOLO’d too hard, and are thinking of yoloing again, we need to rebuild our portfolios. \n\nI’m currently working with...\n\n100 shares of IQ\n\n100 shares of MU\n\n100 shares of TWTR\n\n100 shares of CVS\n\n100 shares of KR\n\nIf you were to purchase these shares right now, it would run you about $21,000. I’m aiming to make a $500 return per month.\n\nI’ll post around the end of the month. I wanted to provide a perspective that is about safer income generating strategies, and hopefully someone will gain some insight from this. \n\nEDIT: I will be doing this until the end of December. If I get assigned I might move to calendar spreads.
