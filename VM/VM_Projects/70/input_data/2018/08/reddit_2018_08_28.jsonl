It’s about using logic to determine at what price you’re willing (or no longer willing) to invest in it.\n\nI love Tesla’s vision. As a consumer. As a citizen of the world. As a humanitarian. But as an investor? It will depend on how much I’m paying and what I’m getting in exchange for it.\n\nWhen you buy Tesla stock, do you know how much money Tesla gets? Zero. Zilch.\n\nSo every dollar I pay out in purchasing TSLA stock doesn’t benefit Tesla or its vision. All it does is benefit whoever sold me their shares. And it benefits his/her vision, his/her kids, his/her life. \n\nSo since none of my money goes to Tesla when I buy TSLA stock, we have to use analysis to determine how much I’m paying and what I’ll get in return.\n\nIf you want to support Tesla’s vision, go buy a car. The money goes straight to Tesla’s pocketbook, and you get to enjoy the car.\n\nBut if you’re gonna buy the stock, then you have to be willing to say, I’m willing to buy it at x price, and I’m no longer willing to buy it at y price.\n\nI don’t own TSLA stock. I don’t think the company will go under. But I don’t think it’s worth $30 Billion, either.\n\nBut analysis dictates that I say at what I price I’d be willing to consider buying. All else being the same I’d buy it if it dropped below $185. I might be wrong, but at least I’m not just saying “NO TESLA NEVAH NEVAH NEVAH”.\n\nHere’s the opposite side to that coin. All else being equal, at what price would you say that it’s no longer even worth buying as an investment? $70B? $100B? $200B? $1.5T?\n\nIf tomorrow TSLA’s stock price made it worth more than Apple and Amazon combined but were unable to demonstrate any material changes from 2nd quarter profitability, would you *still* want to buy the stock?\n\nThat’s what analysis is.

I don’t think TSLA is a zero.\n\nBut I don’t think it’s worth $300+ (55B) either.\n\nTSLA  is currently at -4.22 EPS.\n\nEven if TSLA managed to completely flip the script next quarter and makes 1.00 EPS that’s still a P/E ratio of 300:1.
