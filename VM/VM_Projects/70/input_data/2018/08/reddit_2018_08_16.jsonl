They had +83% Y/Y growth in Datacenters (at $760 million), +52% Y/Y growth from Gaming (at $1.8 billion), +20% Y/Y growth from Professional Visualization (at $257.5 million), +13% Y/Y growth from Automotive (at $147.6 million), and a decrease of -54% Y/Y from OEM and IP (at $116 million; which includes Crypto related sales).\n\n\nSo what you're telling me is that Cryptocurrency related sales were $18 million, and that the $18 million is such a huge part of the Nvidia's business that none of the other aspects of the business that grew (minus the OEM/IP business, which had projections of $187.2 million, which $82 million of that was from projections of crypto sales) matters. That somehow, that Crypto-related sales, which only made $18 million in revenues has a huge impact on the almost $3.12B in revenues made this quarter.

Or why is AMD just chugging along, when GPU's are at a premium price because of the apparent high demand of GPU's for mining, and the low supply of GPU's.
