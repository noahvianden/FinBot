It has leveled off since the late October rally, but it remains on a slight incline. \n\nI'm looking at several great pieces of news and a few challenging ones. The Model Y production predictions are damn interesting. I really think the Model Y will do for SUVs what the Model 3 did for sedans. \n\nGM's restructuring proves that they now recognise autonomous electric vehicles to be the future and are pursuing that. though not for their pickup line for some reason. I really don't understand that. They're ceding the ground to Tesla, Rivian or even Ford. How is it that Ford can be more forward looking than GM when it comes to pickups? Dropping the Volt indicates that Musk was right about PHEVs being a mere transitional measure before full BEV market supremacy. I suppose a plug-in hybrid pickup is still progress, but even Ford is probably going to find itself leapfrogged by Tesla and possible Rivian in this regards.\n\nRivian and Nio have proven that others are trying to replicate Tesla's success. Nio has the advantage of actually being engaged in a rapid production ramp-up, with support from Tencent and Alibaba. Rivian has the advantage of targeting the pickup-truck market, which has had no competition in terms of EVs (at least until the Tesla Pickup comes out). Both are attempting a similar luxury, high-tech, science-fiction branding as Tesla. Rivian seems to have a committed founder-CEO, while Nio doesn't. That said, I remain skeptical of either (we've seen what happened to Fisker Karma and Faraday Futures). \n\nWe're going to see how this plays out. Regardless, the \"Tesla killer\" meme needs to be retired. Other companies trying to copy Tesla's business model just validates Tesla's business model. The market is growing exponentially, so there's more than enough room to accommodate multiple companies in the field. Furthermore, neither has proven itself yet. Nio is beginning to with this production ramp, maybe.
