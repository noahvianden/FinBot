Not only do the markets seem incapable of sustaining a rally for more than a week or so, but each peak is lower than the one before, and each low is lower than the one before it. The trade war is a giant anchor on the market right now.\n\nI'm trying to keep my political prejudices at the door when it comes to investing, but Trump deserves a hell of a lot of blame for this. If he deserves credit for the bull-market last year, which was partially a result of the previous administration's work and partially a result of Trump's deregulation and tax cuts, then he also deserves for this blame for his trade-wars, public attacks on the independence of the fed and nonsensical tirades on twitter directed against publicly traded companies.It's one thing to complain about GM's layoffs, its another thing to threaten to revoke EV tax-credits for consumers!

But I don't know, as you said inflation is still really low. \n\nAll I know is that it doesn't take a genius to figure out that what Trump is doing with his trade war and erratic behavior really isn't helping. Whatever good has been done on taxes and regulation has been overwhelmed by the trade war.\n\nI'm much better versed on fiscal policy, which makes these trillion dollar deficits seem really insane this late in the business cycle during a period of full-employment. It might have helped fuel last years' rally, but I worry about the long-term consequences of all that debt, which I think outweighs whatever extra boost it gave to last years' rally. I fully support cutting corporate tax rates, but they could have done to a more moderate level (without the income tax cuts) and closed more deductions so that the whole they would be budget-neutral tax reform instead of a deficit-exploding tax-cut.
