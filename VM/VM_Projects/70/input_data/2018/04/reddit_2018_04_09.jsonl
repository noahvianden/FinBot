{"title": "If you bought into my “options plays” thread Saturday, sell for a profit now. Volume today is very low and this rally might not last. Risk is high and a single Trump tweet could end it all.", "selftext": "[In reference to this thread.](https://redd.it/8afnsr)\n\nI sold my WFC calls. I still have shares of WFC because I got them really cheap, but I sold my WFC FDs just a while ago for a nice profit. I never ended up buying XLF calls at open because my cousin and his wife are staying over so I had to make them tea and food, though if you did, you’re in the green. These XLF calls are *safe enough* to hold if you really want to. “Safe enough” means you won’t lose 100%, but you could still lose 50%-60% from its price as of right now. \n\nI sold my Amazon FDs for a 35% profit. I would’ve held onto them longer, but volume on the upswing later on in the morning was horrible. I still have quite a few May 18th 1600 calls that I bought Friday. I didn’t mention them in my thread because they’re not cheap. So I’m still bullish on Amazon, but not bullish enough to hold FDs on low volume. I suppose you could figure out a risky Amazon play on your own that isn’t as risky as FDs. \n\nCongrats if you bought into my Kool-Aid. I might come back for another thread next time I’m drunk alone at home.
