{"title": "Overview of S&P 500 corrections since year 2009", "selftext": "Graph of this issue:\nhttp://pbs.twimg.com/media/DZsKrS8XcAAKdxp.jpg\n\nRemember the last time stocks fell so hard? You probably don’t, and that’s making today’s market seem harsher than it is.\n\nIt’s a fact of the life of the mind -- things always seem worse in the present. In reality, they’re not. In this bull market alone there’s been five other corrections like this one, and it’s taken around seven months on average for equities to climb out of their hole. Based on that path, the current jitters won’t be fully eradicated until August.\n\nJust because bouts of losses are normal doesn’t mean they’re painless, especially when momentum stocks are leading the way lower. But the statistic is a reminder that it’s unrealistic to expect a market recovery to involve a straight line back up.\n\n“This is very stressful stuff,” said Michael Purves, Weeden & Co.’s chief global strategist. “It’s like going to the gym and lifting weights after you haven’t been to the gym for two years. Part of it is just a very normal psychological, emotional reaction.”\n\nSince 2009, the average correction in U.S. stocks has lasted 200 days and lopped 14 percent from the S&P 500. That means if this one ended this week -- an unlikely prospect, given the index just posted its fourth consecutive move of greater than 1.5 percent -- it would be the second shortest and second shallowest of them all.\n\nIt seems even worse because of how placid markets have been since the last disruption. While individual stocks are regularly rising and falling 5 percent nowadays, consider that in 2016 and 2017 the S&P 500 went through several multi-month stretches without posting a single up or down day of more than 1 percent.\n\nThat hasn’t been the case lately. The S&P 500 dropped 1.7 percent on Tuesday, erasing more than half of the previous day’s 2.7 percent rally. Futures on the gauge rose 0.3 percent at 8:05 a.m. in New York.\n\nStock turbulence as measured by the benchmark anxiety gauge, the Cboe Volatility Index, is much higher. At 22.5 now after rising for the third time in four days, the measure is nearly twice its level for the previous two years. There have already been 22 days in which the S&P 500 moved more than 1 percent in the first three months of the year, triple the total for all of 2017.\n\n“You had this incredible low-volatility environment, but markets are supposed to go up and down,” Michael O’Rourke, JonesTrading’s chief market strategist, said by phone. “Relative to how markets should be and how they behaved most of my career, thus far this selloff is not a major event. At this point the selloff relative to history is just a blip.”\n\nSo the rupture is back-to-normal, and normal is usually hard. Take the action in tech mega-caps, a group that lured investors with gains more than triple the market since 2016. They’ve been cited by money managers as the most crowded trade in Bank of America’s March survey for a second month.", "id": "88zell", "created_utc": 1522676765.0, "score": 173, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 72, "comments": [{"body": "Pretty solid post and a reminder that this is very normal. \n\nYou've got my upvote, OP, but there is one thing I have issue with in this analysis. That is the persistence of the writer (is that you OP?) to imply that the worst is not over. Looking at the chart and the average % moves cited in the article, the opposite seems to be the case and that the worst is in fact behind us.\n\nYeah, so it might take another few months to reach all-time-highs again (if that's even where we're going), but sideways isn't worse than what we've seen. It's better. Sideways is better than down, is it not?. All of the other corrections in the chart, except for arguably 2015, have a quick drop, chop sideways for a few months, and then recover. We've already had our quick drop and have started chopping sideways. If we follow those previous corrections, there's more sideways chop before recovery, but *we've already seen the bottom*. That, to me, means the worst is behind us.\n\nThe article cites the average correction being -14%. Ours right now hit -12% on SPX. That seems pretty in-line with average to me, no?
