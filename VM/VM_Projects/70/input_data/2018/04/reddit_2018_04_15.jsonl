", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "So my idea is, normal stock people generally buy options, not sell them. Selling carries more risk too. Most people buy and then sell the same contract.\n\nWhat this also means is that market makers write most option contracts. So this is why max pain is an indicator of what the stock price will likely do... because that's the lowest payout strike that the option writers will have to pay to the option buyers.\n\nIf you were a market maker and had to write 80% of the options on both sides, because most randoms generally buy instead of write options, then it is also to your advantage to pick a side. If you have to drive the price toward max pain anyway, then it makes sense to buy calls or puts from normies, depending on which way you will move the price.\n\nRight now on the TV and in many articles AMD is getting trashed. So that says to me that the general normie's sentiment is bearish. They also are too stupid to make the time to read reports, so they don't know AMD's future is bright.\n\nRight now for AMD's 4/20 expy, for the 6 to 14 strikes, the put cash payouts total $2.2 billion, and the calls $257 million. If the stock closes at the max pain $12 strike on 4/20, puts would payout $19.1 million and calls $20.9 million.\n\nSince the 12 strike is higher than the current stock price, I as a market maker would drive the price toward $12 by 4/20. But, as the price moves up the number of open calls and puts will change, so the maxpain might go a bit lower than 12 to 11.50 or 11 when all of the money is balanced EOW. Right now the $10 strike has 88.6m put payout and 2.1m call payout. As a market maker I'd rather payout 80% of 40m (at the $12) than 80% of 90m (at the $10).\n\nFor these reasons I expect AMD to close between 10.50 and 11.50 on 4/20. I might know more on the 19th.\n\nTL;DR I'm aware wsb is for memes. I never post here. I make posts like this one as comments because I like to share information, but only to people who want it.

To my understanding, when \"normies\" are bearish, they either don't buy or just sell what shares or options they have.  \n\n(in other words, the \"normies\" don't buy puts) I think so anyway.\n\nand \n\n2.)  >>- \"But, as the price moves up the number of open calls and puts will change,\"  \n\n Well, this exactly. Things will change to much and too fast, and I feel you have to just be in the moment and go with what happens. You have to be quick and just catch the opportunity if you are looking at it at the right time.\n\n We will see very soon as the 20th is coming up, and if your theory stands, I will make some ok profit if $AMD moves on up to $10.50 which I can't wait to see.  \n\nI personally don't believe it.
