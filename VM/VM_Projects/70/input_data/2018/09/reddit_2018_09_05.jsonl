{"title": "Reviewing the 5% MU drop", "selftext": "Today MU dropped 5%. Naturally as a bagholder holding calls expiring in Janurary and October, I looked at the news that came out today.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. [George Soros Breaks up with Micron Stock, Boosts AMD Instead](https://www.smarteranalyst.com/hedge-funds/billionaire-george-soros-breaks-micron-mu-stock-boosts-advanced-micro-devices-amd-instead/)\n\nThis was the initial catalyst I figured that caused todays crash. No other semis dumped as hard as us, AMAT and LRCX were fine. If you read through that article, you will notice that Soros' holdings were only 400,000 shares, which is a little over 1% of the daily average volume.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. [Micron Delivers GDDR6 production performance as NVIDA launch partner](https://www.micron.com/about/blogs/2018/september/micron-delivers-gddr6-production-performance-as-nvidias-launch-partner)\n\nIn an article penned today, Micron is making RAM for the \\~raytracer\\~ cards.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. [ADATA DRAM revenue spikes 35% on demand in August, from July thanks to stable DRAM pricing](http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/biz/archives/2018/09/05/2003699795)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nADATA is a Taiwanese DRAM manufacturer. They reported 35% increase in monthly DRAM sales from July to August. Looks good for MU ER this month. I assume people are more interested in guidance for the next quarter however to confirm the cyclical theory.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's the most interesting one.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4.  [Samsung delays expansion of Taiwanese factory](https://money.udn.com/money/story/5612/3318769) (article from August 20th)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne of the biggest things overhanging MU is the cyclical theory, that memory prices will collapse any time now and these companies will stop producing record profits. SK Hynix announced a delay to the expansion of their new facility a few weeks ago which triggered the initial 5% rally. However a rumour going to press in 6 hours on [Digitimes](https://www.digitimes.com/topic/bits+chips/memory_chips/) is that \"Samsung, SK Hynix reportedly to defer expansion plans\". No doubt this would reduce the supply that the cyclical meme relies on.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7y3of16uehk11.png?width=843&format=png&auto=webp&s=055db429492933f5dd0bafd2b14159e95ea2a039\n\n&#x200B;\n\n5.
