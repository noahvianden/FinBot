You can always work somewhere and do something to make $2000.  \n\nRemember that the biggest problem with losers is that they keep losing. Don't allow yourself to keep losing, I usually don't follow it anymore, but If I had a trade that started to lose over $100, I would usually drop it. Sometimes I would let it go to -$200 just to see if it would turn around, and it never would.  \n\nthere  was only one time I held a future at a loss of -$5000 and I was margin called and all this and that on it, and I held it overnight and it literally recovered the next day, only because of something that caused it to fly back up. Personally I think it was because they were trying to get me to close it out because come to think about it, it was way back right before some real serious rally days were about to start. \n\nanyway, point is, don't wait, and accept losses quickly and try again. \n\nI tried the same mentality of hoping it would recover when losing, and it made me lose thousands. I just recently tried to hold a $TVIX 2700 shares position I bought in around $6.. well look, its now at $5.60 or so and lost me $1400,  I decided to let it go and play up on $SPX with 3 options today which already got me back $360. (I also opened up 17 $SPY Calls because I was pissed about $TVIX dropping so hard) haha\n\non the example with the futures, remember with futures, like shares, you have no time decay or time limit, so that's why I can wait for that to recover. (except for margin requirements. etc)\n\nSo there is my story about holding too long and thinking it would work for me..\n\nSo now remember being short Apple isn't good if it doesn't go your way too soon, and the weird thing is that when you get out, Apple will drop more..\n\nMy good story on that was I tried $40,000 in Apple shares (with margin) and all the sudden I was down $-3000 or so in like 3-4 days..  \n\nAll I had to do was wait.. I was in at $149 or $156? somewhere around there. I closed it because it was $-4000 at one point or something.  \n\nBut when you are long shares, all you have to do is wait, but it's so boring. \n\nCalls and puts you're screwed with time.. \n\nBut it's not worth shorting anything unless you got the bad news, or it's one of those red days that just keeps going into 4pm red.", "score": 9, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "you really think real money will buy in right now because \"its about to hit a milestone\"? lmao", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "I think buybacks and the fact that Warren just added 75million shares into the value is why you won't see it drop further.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "That news has already shot it up 15%", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "right, and it will hold there or else Warren will have some pretty big losses if it drops 15%", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I am pretty sure warren doesn't but apple stock at market price, so he doesn't care about short term losses, also he added in way before this quarter, so he got it for much cheaper adding on to that.

There are actually prospectuses out for this that explains this.  Simply, VIX is calculated by what options are owned in the market, and has nothing to do with expected price move.  This belief is rookie shit and a key to recognizing people who don't know what they're talking about.  Simply put, by purchasing a lot of options way outside of underlying price, you can spike VIX.  Like, SPy is trading at 273 range, if I bought 1,000,000 put options with a 237 strike, VIX will go up.  Because VIX is based on open interest, not price movement.
