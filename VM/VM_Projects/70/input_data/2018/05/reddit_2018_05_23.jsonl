If the battery catches fire, is exposed to high heat, or is generating heat or\r\ngases, use large amounts of water to cool the battery. It can take approximately 3,000 gallons of water, applied directly to the battery,\r\nto fully extinguish and cool down a battery fire; always establish or request an additional water supply. If water is not immediately\r\navailable, use dry chemicals, CO2, foam, or another typical fire-extinguishing agent to fight the fire until water is available.\r\nExtinguish small fires that do not involve the high voltage battery using typical vehicle firefighting procedures.\r\nDuring overhaul, do not make contact with any high voltage components. Always use insulated tools for overhaul.\r\nHeat and flames can compromise airbag inflators, stored gas inflation cylinders, gas struts, and other components which can result in\r\nan unexpected explosion. Perform an adequate knock down before entering a hot zone.\r\nBattery fires can take up to 24 hours to extinguish. Consider allowing the battery to burn while protecting exposures.\r\nAfter all fire and smoke has visibly subsided, a thermal imaging camera can be used to actively measure the temperature of the high\r\nvoltage battery and monitor the trend of heating or cooling. There must not be fire, smoke, or heating present in the high voltage\r\nbattery for at least one hour before the vehicle can be released to second responders (such as law enforcement, vehicle transporters,\r\netc.). The battery must be completely cooled before releasing the vehicle to second responders or otherwise leaving the incident.\r\nAlways advise second responders that there is a risk of battery re-ignition.\r\nDue to potential re-ignition, a Model S that has been involved in a submersion, fire, or a collision that has compromised the high\r\nvoltage battery should be stored in an open area at least 50 ft (15 m) from any exposure.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "lmao is this the new model Y?", "score": 30, "replies": [{"body": "Model flY", "score": 52, "replies": [{"body": "Fyi, it’s the new model", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "Pretty fly for a white guy", "score": -1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "10/10 had me laughing ", "score": 54, "replies": []}, {"body": "Fake news!
