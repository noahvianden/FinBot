I don't understand why you would want to be long an option that you expect to go to 0\n", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "A) Because thats what a vertical credit spread is. You sell a call closer to the money, because it is more valuable, and then buy a call further out of the money, because it is less valuable. The difference in the value of the options is how much you make (how much you are credited for the sale)\n\nB) Because thats not what a vertical credit spread is.\n\nC) Yes, if the underlying went up, and the stock price is above $200 at expiration, you would need to exercise the $250 call you bought to cover the shares for the $200 call that you sold. This strategy is intended for if you believe the price of the stock will fall. If you expect the price of the stock to rise, you sell a put credit spread.\n\nD) No, thats not what a vertical spread is. That is a DEBIT spread, which is another strategy. You are selling a less valuable call and buying a more valuable call, which costs you money to do. Hence you are charged the difference between the two calls to open the position (or debited that amount).\n\nE) You want to be long a call that you expect to go to zero because you made (or were credited) the money at the time of the initial sale. In my example, you *made* $5 on the sale of the credit spread once you opened the position. Then, you are expecting the price of the stock to fall, so the value of both contracts goes to 0, expire out of the money, and you keep your $5. \n\nAlthough this is a rudimentary explanation of the concept, it is how credit spreads work. The opposite of this is the put credit spread, which is where you expect the price of the stock to rise.", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "You a real one for replying to all of my questions. \n\nAren't debit spreads a better risk/reward bet though as you are only risking your initial premium debited but in the credit spread you are risking way more and the gain is limited to your initial premium credited?\n\nTo add to that: if your example moves against you and your buy expires ITM you would lose 5gs (bought call)-(sold call)= ((100x250)-(100x200)). Your gain is limited to just $5 though. Is my math right on this?", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "You are right, but that's why you need to understand the greeks when you sell options. In this fictional scenario, those strikes would be way OTM. A 10% premium on that strike width ($5 credit out of $50 strike width) would mean there is a high probability of profit for you, the seller. Closer to ATM, you could expect a 60% credit of the strike width. \n\nSelling options is more profitable than buying options, because you earn more premium created by IV, and backtesting has shown that there is a discrepancy between implied volatility and actual volatility. That means that on a macro level, option premiums are too expensive for how the stock actually moves, so capturing that premium means a higher probability of profit. ", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "It depends on the situation. A stock with high volitility has high option premiums, so selling credit spreads is a good way to capitalize on larger premium differences between strikes. This is just one aspect of it though, im on my phone now so itd be hard for me to type out anything in depth. Theres some good sites that come up in google searches with simple explanations if you search the right terms. \n\nBoth credit spreads and debit spreads have known risk at the time you open the positjon. Max risk for a debit spread is the amount you paid to open the position, and max risk for a credit spread is the difference in the strike prices minus what uou were credited for the sale. \n\nSo for the example i made earlier, your max risk for opening the call credit spread would be $45. You made $5 from selling a call at $10 and buying one at $5. You used $50 collateral to cover for in case the stock price ends up above $200 at expiration, which forces you to exercise the call that you bought for $5 to cover the call you sold for $10.  \n\nYour max risk is $45 since you needed $50 collateral to open the position, but made $5 on the sale. \n\nSo for your last question, if the stock moves against you, the call you sold would end up ITM before the call you bought does. You would typically get out of the position before this happens though. How much you actually lose on the deal if it turned against you would just depend on when you closed the position, if decide to close it before expiration. \n\nYour max loss is plain and simply $45. You cannot lose any more than that amount. Thats why these strategies are commonly used, the risk is set and the reward is set. Your max profit is $5, and your max loss is $45.\n\nI opened a put credit spread on netflix last week that turned against me (I should have looked deeper into it before opening the position). I sold a $372.5 put and bought a $370 put. The difference in premiums for these two contracts was $0.74. The difference in strike prices was $2.50. \n\nSo, of course multiply by 100, I made $74 from the initial sale. I needed $250 collateral to cover the difference in strike prices. My max loss was $250-$74, or $176. I closed the position before the price went below the $372.5 put that I sold.\n\nIts honestly hard to explain this stuff in this manner.. It took me a good while to grasp the concept since i was learning on my own. \n\nIn essence, what you are doing, is hoping that the difference in premiums for the contracts shrinks. You made your money from the differences in the premiums. As your contracts go further out of the money, the gap between how much they cost shrinks. It also shrinks due to time decay.

I'm looking into opening bull call spreads, but the articles on Investopedia are confusing me, particularly when they discuss maximum gains.\n\nLets say I buy a November $60 call on Company X for $4.00 ($400) and sell a November $70 call for $2.00 ($200).\n\nIf the underlying moves to $67 the day before expiration, theoretically couldn't I have massive gains by closing my long call and keeping the short call open? (assuming the underlying won't move the short call ITM)\n\nInvestopedia seemed to imply the max gain would be the (Higher strike) - (Lower strike) - (Difference in premiums). That can't be right?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "So that is a debit spread (although im sure you knew that). Im not as familair with them, but ill try to help as best I can. \n\nThe essence of a debit spread is that you are relying on the gap between the two options to grow. You bought the position (in your case) when the difference between the premiums was $2.00. As the price of the underlying moves upward, the value of your long position goes up faster than the value of your short position. \n\nThis means that the spread that you purchased for $2.00 ($200) now has a higher gap between the long and short position of say $3.00 ($300). You then close the position by selling the spread for $300 and making a profit of $100.\n\nIf you sold the long call and held the short call, you would have to hope the price of the underlying doesnt go above $70 at expiration, because you would owe someone 100 shares of underlying that you dont own. You only \"owned\" them when you bought a call at $60... You bought the ability to \"call away\" 100 shares at $60.\n\nIf it were me, I would simply sell the spread back. But to answer your question, it would be better to buy back the short position, allow the long position to continue to increase in value as the underlying goes up, then sell it sometime later. \n\nYour potential losses would be infinite if you held your short call, because you would have to purchase 100 shares at whatever the price is at expiration to provide them to the person who bought that $70 call from you. So if the price of the underlying rockets and is $300 at the expiration of the $70 call you sold, you would have to purchase them for $30,000, then turn around and sell them for $7,000 which would be a loss of $23,000.\n\nNever a good idea to be short a call for shares that you dont own.

The chance for this spread ending ITM is fairly low (for example purposes), so your chance of losing the $43 is also low.\n\nFor the spreads at the bottom, you make $27 and you need $50 for collateral.
