Let me explain what I ment with a little more tact and understanding: If you sell a future, you have negative how many deltas the future is (it depends on what kind of contract and underlying you are trading). For /ZB I think it's quoted in 1/32:ths, minimum tick size is 31.25$ which makes this -1000 delta. If you then sell an OTM put against your short /ZB, it takes away some of that delta because as you correctly said, selling puts is a bullish position. So maybe you sell the 300 delta put against your short position, which nets you a -700 delta position with positive theta.
