This is coming at a time when corporate debt is at all time highs. Margins are going to continue to decline and companies are going to struggle much harder at paying down long term debt. Those that aren't prepared will likely fail. Which means they will do lay offs or go out of business all together. Either way, the work force that will be hit by all of it are the ones who won't even be halfway through paying off their insane student loan debt. I believe this is going to spark a major depression in both the global and US market.\n\nTL;DR I believe China is going to bring a whole new meaning to the phrase \"Domino Theory\".\n\n\n", "id": "9rskp3", "created_utc": 1540626150.0, "score": 77, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 63, "comments": [{"body": "Probably the only reason the Fed is raising rates is so that they have ammo when all this comes to play.
