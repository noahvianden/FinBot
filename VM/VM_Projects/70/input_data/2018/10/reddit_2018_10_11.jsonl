They were getting sued for it. Everyone thought that they would go to zero. They'd be sued into oblivion, fined by the government, people would stop buying their products, or all of the above.\n\nThe thesis was rock solid. The stock traded at cheap prices...like 6-8x earnings cheap, even though profits were growing fairly reliably! Really fucking cheap because everyone ~~thought~~ knew the endgame was just around the corner. They ended up paying billions in settlements, fines, etc. They sold less product over time. \n\nBut these companies started buying back their stock in quantity. Huge quantities. Everyone thought they were crazy. Why buy back stock that's going to be worthless? Dumb. \n\nWell, guess what? These stocks were cigarette stocks. They're still around today. And they've been like the best investments of all time forever. The future for the business was way better than everyone forecast.\n\nThe difference between cigarette stocks and Tesla is that cigarette stocks didn't need to raise endless amounts of money from Wall Street. The cigarette stocks were cash flow positive, earned good returns on capital, etc.\n\nTesla could be in the same situation. Instead of being cocky and borrowing money that has a due date, Tesla could have issued equity. Instead of waiting until the bank account bleeds red to issue more stock, Tesla could get ahead of its cash needs and sell stock when it can.\n\nTesla is dependent on the capital markets because it chooses to be. Normal, profitable, cash flow-positive businesses have no need for the stock market. If Wal-Mart's stock trades for $1 or $100, it doesn't matter at all to Wal-Mart's existence.

Raise enough money with equity so that it has enough cash in the bank to get profitable/cash flow positive.\n\nIf it does one of those two things, the stock price will be completely irrelevant to its existence and its success. \n\nThe only way a company's stock price can put it out of business is if the business needs to continuously sell more stock to stay in business. \n\n", "score": 18, "replies": [{"body": "Interesting points.
