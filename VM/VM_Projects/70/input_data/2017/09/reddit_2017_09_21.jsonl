Lisa Su willing, I'll be closer to $60k. Additionally, I got a promotion back in May and with it, the promise that I'll see a big raise come years end. I know companies can't be trusted etc..., but considering the nature of my circumstance/position I trust I'll see at least a $10k rise in salary. If I keep my expenses remain stable I'll easily hit $100,000+ by late 25, early 26. At that point I'm going to need to make some serious life decisions.... Am I happy doing what I do? Can I gamble $30k of this on a 3x Leveraged ETF for maximum Yacht-age?
