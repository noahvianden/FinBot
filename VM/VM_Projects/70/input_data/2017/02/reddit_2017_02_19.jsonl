AMD, I've been a long time user of AMD processors and I like the direction they are going. MSFT, big fan of Microsoft as well, pays dividends.\n\nIs it better to buy 30 of shares of AMD, or about 8 shares of MSFT? I feel like having more shares of something is better, but Microsoft is steady and still trending up. \n\nWhat is my best move here?\n\nEdit: Not much talk about SNAP, even from me. I guess I'm not that interested in it after all.\n\nEdit 2: thanks for all the input guys. Lots of delicious input. I'm gonna do $400 AMD and 2 stocks of MSFT.

Let's pretend I have 10 shares of AMD at 10 costing $100 and it goes from 10 to 20.

This means I gain $10 per share, bringing my dollar amount to $120, correct?\n\nOr do i have a misunderstanding of the stock market and shares?

MSFT 50>60 would be a 20% gain, while AMD 10>20 would be a 100% gain. That same percent gain in MSFT 50>100 would bring your dollar amount to $200.\n\nStock share prices are near arbitrary. AMD could do a 5:1 reverse split and make their shares $50 each. Some companies release less shares, making each individual share worth more, creating a barrier to entry. Higher share price can cut-out small time individuals, allowing only more serious investors to play; this can make the stock less volatile. Lower share price companies, like AMD, have lots of shares released, allowing the average person to be able to afford shares. These lower share price stocks can have higher volatility, as its likely more traders are involved.\n\nMany companies try to create an in-between share price, like AAPL. Low share price allows people that are more likely to need that small amount of money at the end of the month, and if a bunch of average shareholders decide they need their lil money *now*, it could drop the price in a short time. Higher priced shares are less likely to have holders that need to liquidate their holdings suddenly/frequently. AMZN, GOOGL, PCLN, and other high share priced securities say: We don't want people that don't have enough to invest to be messing around. They want to encourage bigger investors to sit and stay comfortably. BRK.A is an extreme example of this.", "score": 18, "replies": [{"body": "Ok that makes sense now.

Thanks for your help", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "General rule of thumb: lower priced stocks will have more volatile moves. Not always, but most of the time. Mostly just because of the mechanics of the market. Since the minimum spread for anything above $1.00 is generally $0.01, most stocks will move in 1 cent increments (regardless of how fast they do it). So the mathematics are such that a 1 cent move in a $1.00 stock is a 1% move, where as a 1 cent move in a $100 stock is only a 0.01% move. \n\nTL;DR: cheaper stocks are usually more volatile.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "Kind of does matter, if you're being charged commission per share.
