What's a coincidence is the stock starts rocketing once GS was done with their rights to buy at average day price. \n\nThey were loading up daily while the price tanked, and there's even proof of it. I have no proof of collusion lol but I really think these guys \"raid\" stocks together with partners, it's not the first time this same scenario played out with NVDA and others.\n\nI think we are headed to ATH very very soon if we can keep up the bull run macro wise. Yellen said good shit the one day I decided to chill and take it easy. Sold at 158 but I'll be back in if we get a dip tomorrow like usual before the move. \n\nEven if no dip I may just hold some shares forever because they going to the moon $200 by EOY, by earnings if they can pull another surprise.

Many would-be buyers will rightfully and safely hold off and do nothing tomorrow because of this. That will cause the sellers to take control for a short time.\n\nThis isn't ATH, but it's close.
