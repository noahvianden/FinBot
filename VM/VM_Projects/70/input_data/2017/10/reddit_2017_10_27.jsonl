Because somebody could have a limit order to sell for an amount way higher than the bid/ask prices, and market order can make you buy an option that’s way overpriced.

Credit is irrelevant here. IB will have a 20 question quiz about options. Pretty basic stuff but there was a few that are a tad tricky.  TD and other brokers just ask for you income and net worth, and your goals. If you’re trying to get approved for options, obviously want To select *growth* and *speculation* when it asks what your goals are. Also make sure your income isn’t tooo low (aka you may need to lie a little on it) \n\nAnd if you’re new , start with call leaps. And it’s buying to open to start a position.
