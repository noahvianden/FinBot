Sometimes a teeny bit; sometimes a lot. \n\nTwo years ago I decided to make it on my own as a trader. I quickly succumbed to being hypervigilant, caring about every little dip and bounce, and generally freaking out. I DRAMATICALLY underperformed the market, and it took me over another year to make up the losses just to break even again (while the S&P had recovered at the end of the first year).\n\nNow, a different anecdote from my past: In July of 2008 I said to myself, \"Shit! This market is crashing! I better get out!\" - and moved 100% into bonds. I watched with relative disinterest as... well, go google late 2008, if you have a short memory, or are new to this game.\n\nIn Jan of 2009 I decided the freefall was over, and went back 100% into stocks. I then committed to Not Looking; I didn't want to be scared, because there was a 0.0001% chance I had correctly timed the bottom. I hadn't; it kept falling until March 2009. But I successfully did not look again until June 2009, by which time things looked much better.\n\nI got out of the Great Recession with less than 10% loss. I proceeded to make a killing in the next 5 years.\n\nNow, let me emphasize: being completely blind to the market wasn't a good strategy; it worked through luck. But the OTHER reason it worked is that it kept me immune from the hyperemotional reactions EVERYONE was having. I was unemployed. I had to move into cheaper housing. Along the way, I met a professional who was now living (secretly) out of a storage locker in one of those unheated megarental buildings. I mean by all of this: everyone was freaking out, and not without reason. But regardless of \"justification\", emotions make for poor decision guides. They're pretty good at getting you out of the way of a speeding car, but not so good at saving on your grocery bill, brushing your teeth regularly, or investment strategies.\n\nSo, I guess the point of this long story is: Most people allow their fears and greed and envy (EVERYONE ELSE IS MAKING A KILLING IN TECH!!!!!!!!! BUY ANYTHING NAMED DOT-COM!) to guide them away from even average performance.\n\nEvery trade incurs cost. If you unwisely buy and sell an index ETF every hour, you will lose a lot of money - underperforming the ETF itself.
