The closing price for that stock, the quote, is therefore $35.41. After hours, the volume of trades/interest drops significantly there are fewer people buying and selling. Typically what happens is there is someone who puts a lower end ask (sell order) with a limit just under what it closed at, say $35.35. If someone has a bid (buy order) that matches that, the trade executes. That drops the after hours quote for the stock to $35.35, or -$0.06 after hours.\n\nIt's the same thing for opening. That stock will open at $35.35, unless there are pre-market trades. Someone might have placed a buy order over night, or maybe some news broke in the morning before the bell.
