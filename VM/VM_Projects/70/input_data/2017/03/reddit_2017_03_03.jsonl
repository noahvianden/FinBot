{"title": "The REAL reason for SNAP's valuation", "selftext": "Alright, listen up. I know a lot of you motherfuckers have been shitting on SNAP's $30 billion valuation and have chocked it up to middle-aged and technologically inept bankers' fear of missing out on the \"next Facebook\". But listen closely my friends, this is not so.\n\n**SNAP** **is** **HEAVILY** **UNDERVALUED**, **and** **this** **DD** **will** **prove** **why**. \n\nWhat those smug bastards at Goldman Sachs know that you don’t is that Evan Spiegal and his buddy, Bobby, have an ingenious business plan that would put the likes of Zuckerberg, Bezos and Jeff Skilling to shame.\n\nIt’s simple - blackmail.\n\nWhy else do you think every buy-side institution has their employees clicking \"BUY SNAP\" on their Bloomberg terminals like it's the fucking cure to autism? Obviously, they know something you schmucks don't - and that's the ingenious plan of SNAP I’m about to lay out here.\n\nNow bear with me on this, it's gonna involve a bit of arithmetic, so stop sucking yourselves off for a second and just think: what percentage of SNAP users have sent a dick pic to another user?\n\nLet's be conservative here and estimate that half of SNAP's 158m user base is male, and that another half of those have sent a dick pic, putting us at 39.5m guilty faggots. We’ll round that up to 40m to account for trannies and the like. Now, obviously, those numbers are higher (personal experience) but to placate all the SNAP haters we'll go with these lower estimates.\n\nNow I know what you're thinking - “but those dick pics are all gone right? Isn't that the whole point of snapchat - to make all these raunchy pics I'm sending my boyfriends vanish from cyberspace?”. \n\nI'm sorry to tell you -  but that's where you’re **DEAD** **WRONG**. Why do you think SNAP is spending $400m/year on Google cloud and $200m/year on AWS if they are just gonna end up losing all that precious “data”? \n\nYou can bet your sorry ass that Evan and Bobby have got your dick pics stored, along with all your other personally identifiable information. And guess what, these spectacle-wearing motherfuckers won't be afraid to use it. With SNAP user growth slowly stagnating they are gonna have to start executing this part of their masterplan.\n\nNow, how much would you pay to avoid the embarrassment of having all your friends and family be sent that pic of your semi-erect 3 inch chubby? Obviously, some of you fucks would actually get off on that kind of scenario, but for most of us civilized folk I’d be willing to bet we would pay at least the equivalent of an iPhone, aka 750 bucks. \n\nAlright - so let’s put it all together: we have 40m users we can blackmail, each of which will pay 750 bucks for a total of (40m*750) = $30 billion. Now the analyst in me is compelled to discount those cash flows, over the collection period - which we will put at around 1 year, with a standard discount rate of 10%. That gives us an NPV of $27 billion.\n\nA conservative estimate of the rest of SNAP’s business would be around $13 billion, so we are looking at **SNAP’s** **true** **value** **of** **$40** **fucking** **billion**. Also, Spiegal will obviously go double irish like Facebook and won’t pay any taxes so we can ignore those.\n\nI just bought 1,000 shares, see you cucks on the moon.\n\n**TL**;**DR** **SNAP** **is** **worth** **$40billion** **(conservatively)** **because** **dick** **pics.**\n\n**Edit**: Now I know there’s gonna be a couple of you fuckers out there who are gonna claim that this is “illegal” and never gonna happen. I have only one question for you: did you ever read the fucking fine-print when signing up for the service?\n\n**Edit** **2**: [Further evidence](http://imgur.com/gallery/v765i)\n", "id": "5x7e4u", "created_utc": 1488503758.0, "score": 188, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 70, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 145, "replies": [{"body": "Get ready to buy those yachts, good sir.", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]  \n ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.4027 \n > [The Story of the Hoover Dam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNQ4-Cm5AhY)", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "I prefer the ambiance of the brick-and-mortar Yachts-Я-Us.
