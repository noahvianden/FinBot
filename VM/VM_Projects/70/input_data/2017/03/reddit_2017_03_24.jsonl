{"title": "DD (FUEL) Rocketfuel fueling our next moon mission!", "selftext": "This is my first DD, and damn apps crashed on me twice writing this f'ing Thing, so here it is quick and dirty. It's off the top of my head. Not bothering exiting out again to get the exact stats for this to crash again. Gotta get up in 2 hours for market open and work tomorrow. I'll send you the links once I edit. \n\nEDIT: got the links out, going to bed now, have a good yolo guys.\n\n\nRocketfuel is a company that provides predictive marketing to businesses such as Bridgestone, Toshiba, UFC and many more notable businesses. It was founded in 2008 by Yahoo! Alumni and is based in Redwood City, California. It has with 20 other locations totaling 850+ employees in NA, Europe and Japan. Now Imagine if you search for furry porn on Friday night when your friends are out partying. Sunday morning your mom wakes you up because she saw naked bipedal foxes on her sidebar when she was searching for fuzzy kittens. That's basically what this company does.\n\n\n\nFinancials \n\n1.) Revenue: $450+ million\nIt's beaten the past few earnings by a few cents. Market cap is $180 million.\n\n2.) It's share price has dropped significantly since its IPO in 2013, from $60 something down to $4.50 now. However, its share price has gone up 160% in the past 3 months and don't seem to be slowing anytime soon.\n\n3.) It's EPS have been shitty, but not as shitty as expected. Actual eps has been -.22 instead of an expected -.25. Shitty, but it beat it.\n\n4.) Came across a this thread on Reddit last night, The US Senate votes to let ISPs sell your search data to advertisers. Could prove very fucking valuable to these guys.\n\n\nTHREAD:\n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/613c7f/senate_votes_to_let_isps_sell_your_web_browsing/\n\nSource: \nhttps://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/03/senate-votes-to-let-isps-sell-your-web-browsing-history-to-advertisers/\n\nLINKS:\n\nhttps://rocketfuel.com\n\nVideo of how big data and AI made Rocketfuel:\nhttps://youtu.be/LqjdfiWQJBs\n\nFinmiz:\nhttp://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FUEL\n", "id": "618amj", "created_utc": 1490353824.0, "score": 68, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 72, "comments": [{"body": "Its name is fucking Rocket Fuel.
