{"title": "Listen up, Buy Amazon Calls before their next earnings, regardless of market conditions and really anything.", "selftext": "The biggest problem with their profits was the shipping, it ate away 5-20% of their revenue. As everyone knows, they started to try out their own shipping thing a few months ago, Amazon Logistics. They have mostly been quiet about this topic for the last few months, but if you look at their data, their Use for Amazon Logistics is almost TEN TIMES HIGHER THAN USUAL for the month of February.\n\nThey are starting to implement it in a huge scale without telling everyone.\n\nThis shit will blow up.\n\nTo make my case stronger, I decided to look at the legal insider trades, and realized that something's off: One director liquidated some of his positions (4k Shares, or 3.5 Million Dollars) 3 weeks ago. Though the quarter is far from done, and he might buy it back, it's still a Red Flag.\n\nMark my word, keep an eye out for Amazon, and snipe their earnings with Calls. Tattoo it on your fucking forehead if need be, this will get you +20%-+80% EASILY.\n\nSorry for any incoherence in my writing, I don't care enough to go back and fix anything, and I don't care enough to revise this shit. As long as you're a smart boy who understands my points, you should be allowed to get your Quarterly Allowance of A SHITLOAD ON AMAZON.\n\nOn other news: \"Since September 22, 2016, it had 0 insider purchases, and 15 insider sales for $29.07 million activity.\"", "id": "60zbmb", "created_utc": 1490236916.0, "score": 65, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "num_comments": 73, "comments": [{"body": "/u/MRPGuy, thoughts?
