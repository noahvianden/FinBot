{"title": "The market will go much higher than this. I am not a economist, just a layman. Reason: Low interest rates, and we are still at an early point in the economic cycle.", "selftext": "Sometimes I see bearish talking heads on CNBC outlining their case as to why the market can't go much higher. I disagree with them on the idea that the market can't go higher, but I do agree with them that the market will eventually correct itself. \n\nOther times I see posts on Reddit saying, \"HURR DURR SHILLER P/E IS TOO HIGH, MARKET MUST CRASH SOON\".\n\nFirst of all, Shiller P/E doesn't take into account what the prevailing interest rate is, which are at historic lows. Secondly, the definition of \"earnings\" has changed over time due to accounting rule changes and such. \n\nWhile the market is certainly more overvalued than it was five years ago, I think a lot of bears are just butthurt people who are jealous that they have not made any money on their bearish moves, be it from buying gold, buying puts on the SPY, or buying VIX calls. They missed out on this bull market. \n\nThat said, I see the market going higher over the next few years as Trump's first term comes to a close. While I doubt tax reform will be done this year, it will probably get done, lowering corporate tax rates and P/E ratios with them. When tax reform is done, valuations are going to change dramatically.\n\nThe recovery from the 2008 to 2009 financial crisis took a very long time, unlike previous recoveries. It took nearly 7 years for the unemployment rate to go back to normal. With that in mind, and inflation still close to all-time lows, I believe that we are still in the early part of the economic cycle. Baring a severe trade war or another major sovereign debt crisis, the stock market will go up even higher from here. \n\nPerhaps by 2020 or 2021 we will see the economy start running out of steam as the Fed raises interest rates to a \"normal\" level... but baring a major financial crisis, the recession to come will be probably pretty mild. \n\nIf you are an investor, buy a solid company and hang onto it. If you are trader, just keep doing what you are doing. If there is one thing I would shy away from, it's buying long-dated SPY puts or going short the indices.\n\nI don't like Trump much, but he has made my Roth IRA very green this morning.", "id": "5wwkho", "created_utc": 1488382274.0, "score": 70, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 77, "comments": [{"body": "I didnt read your post but the reason the market is going to stay afloat is that cutting repatriation taxes will lead to a shit load of share buybacks for DJIA and S&P 500 companies.
