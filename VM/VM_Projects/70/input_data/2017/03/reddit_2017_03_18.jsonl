{"title": "Here's my options strategy. So far, it got me about 20% return last year, and another 20% YTD this year.", "selftext": "I play the probabilities and numbers game.  I don't really care what the company is, what it sells, and what it's balance sheet looks like.  I use the random walk theory of stock price movement and efficient market hypothesis.  So far, my strategy seems to work pretty well for any stock that meets entry criteria, in any market condition (bear, bull, flat, high IV, low IV).\n\nI'm still working on formalizing it (hopefully enough that I can write a screening program to automate it), but here's what I have written out so far:\n\n- Check that next earnings report is at least 45 days away, and there hasn't been a report in the last 10 days.\n- Look at the EMA20, EMA100, spot price, and MACD12,26,9 histogram.  If the Spot>EMA20>EMA100, and MACDHist>0, and MACDHist trend for the last 10 days is upwards, then I'm bullish.  Reverse all that for bearish.  If any one of those is off or not conclusive, then I skip out on that security.\n- Combine my bearish/bullish stance and IVR for what vertical spread to place (bull + low IVR = long call spread, bull + high IVR = short put spread, bear + low IVR = long put spread, bear + high IVR = short call spread).\n- Gather all trades at 20-35 DTE and 66-72% POP\n- Choose the trade with the highest Max Profit:Max Loss ratio\n- Is that ratio >0.18?\n- Select a quantity that puts max loss at no more than 10% of my total portfolio (there is a minimum that's some manual touchy-feely based on Max Profit:Max Loss ratio when fees and slippage are taken into account, as well as total capital utilization in the portfolio)\n- Place the trade!\n\n- Close out when unrealized profit reaches 50% of Max Profit or when unrealized loss reaches 150% Max Profit.  If POP at an unrealized profit of 50% of Max Profit is >85%, stay in until POP <85% or when unrealized profit is 75% Max Profit.\n\nWhat I still need to add into the algorithm (I do this stuff naturally right now, but want to find a place in the flowchart that makes sense when automating):\n\n- Where do I check liquidity and bid/ask spread?  I use the TastyWorks liquidity rank (the 4 stars), but generally I'm looking for high volume on the underlying.  For bid/ask spread, I look for a few pennies, ~~out to about 100% of the bid~~*(not sure what my upper limit is.  I think I've traded some TSLA with a spread of around $1.50-$2.50 before, but it's rare to be more than $.10 spread)* (eg, $.50-$1.00 or $1.00-$2.00).  The tighter, the better.  Maybe I can use this to rank all possible trades and just choose the top few that I don't already have positions on?\n- How do I choose entry price?  On liquid, tight spread trades, I generally enter at about $.01-$.02 worse than the mid price.  Not sure what I'm doing for less liquid markets and need to think about it and study my trades.  I'm thinking it will be some maximum percent away from the mid price (eg, mid-20% of the spread.  So on a long position on a $.90-$1.10, I would enter a limit at $1.02)\n- I'm also considering adding a closing contingency if the spot POP drops below 55%.  Not sure if my POP has ever gotten there, or what my losses are when it reaches that, or what my max loss that I've closed for was (and what the POP at that point was).\n\nAny input or discussion from you guys to help me tweak this would be helpful.  I'm not looking to get rich or play the lottery.  I prefer the slow and steady approach.  A consistent win rate and steady increase in my account is what I am for.\n\nEDIT:  bears =/= bulls\n\nEDIT2:  I have about 120+ trades so far, and the last 4-5 dozen have followed this pretty closely (vs when I was still developing it and throwing in all kinds of random 1-off lottery tickets, covered calls, or stock trades).

Total right now is about -30 on $2k capital utilization on $10k account) so I've not yet experienced a loss on ALL positions at the same time.\n\nAs to whether I can handle a 90% sudden and unexpected drawdown or not, I'm pretty sure I can (financially I can, mentally, that's a big blow to my ego and motivation).  This is just my fun money that I'm playing with.  I've already written it off as a loss, just like when I buy a plane ticket for a vacation.  I don't account for it in my budgeting.  If I lose 100%, I still have all my savings, 401k, IRA, checking, house, equity, car, phone, computer, etc.  So this strategy might not be for anyone who doesn't like volatility, but that's not what I focused on when developing this naturally as I traded how I felt comfortable trading.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "> Close out when unrealized profit reaches 50% of Max Profit or when unrealized loss reaches 150% Max Profit\n\nJust curious, why do you close when you're loss is at 150% of max profit? If you're already that close to your max loss, then you don't have much more to lose.
