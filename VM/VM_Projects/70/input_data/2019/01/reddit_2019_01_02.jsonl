{"title": "AAPL DD", "selftext": "I live in a major U.S City and I attempted to buy some apple airpods the day before Christmas for the gf (not the brightest idea to go shopping the day before Christmas, learned my lesson there) \n\nBut I thought hey, it's available in all the big stores near me so surely they should have them and not be sold out of an overpriced tiny product (shouldn't take up too much space in stores) \n\nBoy was I wrong, and it sucked. As it was the day before Christmas no stores were picking up the phone and it made more sense to just drive to the locations.\n\nTurns out every place was sold out. I checked Best Buy, Target, Walmart,  Khols and the Apple store. All sold out. I asked the managers of these stores if they had any available in any other locations. None. All sold out of every store in a hundred mile radius of a major U.S City. I couldn't believe that even apple didn't have enough of their own inventory, I was shocked when they said all their apple stores had sold out of the airpods so I called up some stores in other major U.S cities. Same thing, all sold out of tiny expensive headphones.  \n\nended up getting her some other gifts but still wanted to purchase the airpods and today I  called a few of the stores I went to previously and they were still sold out/ getting a new shipment in soon.  IMO I think apple will have great earnings next quarter based on these fucking air pods. \n\ntl;dr: Wasted 2 and a half hours driving around / calling stores to see if they had apple airpods available. LONG  AAPL!\n\noh and I went long calls on the 27th https://gyazo.com/e7a88407a135f9aa74dd95c7af997231\n\nalso- normally I buy this type of stuff online but I procrastinated Christmas shopping this year.
