Any regulations slapped on Facebook now, that theyâ€™re having to pay for now, that is all doom and gloom is just an even bigger barrier to entry for a competitor in the future.

And these tools are geared towards business use cases, B2B applications, and lots of data tools and machine learning features.

The problem is you're using trailed EPS figures. Microsoft is expected to grow 2019 EPS at 121% and 2020 EPS at 22.5%...so yeah if you look at the trailing EPS number the PE is 44.

Let your sensible picks be at least diversified and with money you can let sit forever. Maybe you'll get lucky. Few of us can see and interact like Buffett.
