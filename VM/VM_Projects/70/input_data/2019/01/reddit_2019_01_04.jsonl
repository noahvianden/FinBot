{"title": "Intel ($INTC) is a terrible fucking company", "selftext": "Dear Faggots,\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*I've thought about making a video on this for awhile but it wouldn't get shit for views so fuck that, my time is much better spent on watching YouTube and looking at you spergs lose money. Though if there's enough interest I might make a video. Plus I'm 17 and I like smoking weed and chasing girls and don't want to put up with Google's shit algorithm.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo my due diligence on Intel is extensive. It boils down to the fact that they have several key industries that generate them revenue, and they are complete shit (or are about to be shit) in all of them. These sub-industries, or whatever the hell you want to call them are (at least how I view them): **x86 chips** (their CPUs), **wireless chipset** tech, and other **weird bullshit** (Optane Memory, Intel NUCs, future R&D projects). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe main reason, and coincidentally, their main source of revenue (their processors), is because they suck at doing die-shrinks. Seriously, they've been trying to put out a 10nm chip for the past 4 fucking years now, AND THEY STILL HAVEN'T DONE IT. Meanwhile, **AMD is releasing fucking 7nm next processor cycle, and $INTC is still on their bullshit 14nm++++**. Intel has missed their roadmap year after year after year. So Su Bae is gonna kick their lazy asses in terms of performance and power consumption, and price-point as well since Intel thinks they're God's gift and have a huge premium versus a (mostly) equivalent AMD CPU. And this will take effect in the consumer PC market as well as the enterprise hardware, so like servers and shit. \n\nSpeaking of servers, Intel's line of server/workstation CPUs (called Xeon) are complete and utter garbage pricing wise. They did this moronic rebrand where they now use cute little names like Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum to denote the tier of the latest Xeon lineup, Xeon Scalable. Now, Intel is boasting about how Xeon Scalable has sold so well, it's so much better than AMD's server chips, yada yada bunch of bullshit. Legitimately the only reason it's generated so much revenue is because of the fact that this upgrade is basically fucking required 'cause of a socket change (which is bigger than your mom by the way [https://imgur.com/a/NCeJtr2](https://imgur.com/a/NCeJtr2)) and the fact that Intel basically extorted OEMs into using it. And even then the fuckers couldn't keep them in stock, and OEMS fucking recommended AMD Epyc CPUs instead. Good shit Shittel. I'm getting sidetracked, just know that the new generation of AMD's server CPU is gonna fuck Intel in the ass, especially since OEMs are pissed off due to Intel fucking them over and them generally just being pretentious douchebags. \n\nSo then we got the consumer-level shit. And here again AMD is gonna win, what with their higher-core counts and lower prices. Desktops for business and gaming, you name it. Power consumption becomes a much bigger deal for laptops, 2 in 1s, tablets, and 7nm is FAR superior to 14nm (and 10nm if Intel pulls off a goddamn miracle). Better battery life, thinner devices, all of this shit is gonna be powered by AMD chips... but here is a key point, on the higher end of mobile PCs. Here's the other reason why Intel is fucked with their mobile chips: ARM is actually really goddamn good now. ARM-based chips have already been put into Windows devices, and they have really good battery life, but performance always lacks compared to Intel chips. But with the new ARM generations coming out, they can compete with the low-end Intel chips (Like i3s) and the mid-tier ones (i5s), whilst having like 3 times the battery life. Jesus. For instance, a Qualcomm Snapdragon based laptop, and this is the current gen which mind you will be improved with ARM's upcoming 7nm and 5nm die shrinks, gets fucking 22 hours of battery life! Holy shit. And that's just Windows. I personally think Apple is kind of a shit company even though I love my MacBook Pro, but by god they make the best ARM chips. Legit the fucking processor in the iPhone X (a year old phone) is way better than the chips made by Samsung in any Android phone. And the iPhone XS and new iPad Pro? Good god the A12 and A12X are absolute monsters [http://browser.geekbench.com/mobile-benchmarks](http://browser.geekbench.com/mobile-benchmarks). So why the fuck does this relate to Intel? Because Apple is going to make their new MacBook Airs, MacBooks, and lower end MacBook Pros with their in-house ARM chips. And the higher end MacBooks? Well fuck it they'll be on AMD silicon. This is gonna further eat away at Intels precious market share.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOk so now we move on to Intel's dogshit wireless tech. **Intel is absolutely FUCKED for 5G**. Whilst Qualcomm already has a working 5G modem that can fit in a smartphone, Intel hasn't progressed beyond a giant fucking box filled with FPGAs. And 5G won't come immediately, and Qualcomm still has a bunch of work left to do, I think it's safe to say Intel is at least a year behind Qualcomm. Also Intel's current gen modems suck dick and Apple only uses them because of the bitchfit they threw about Qualcomm's pricing model which is gonna continue for the foreseeable future (Long Qualcomm $QCOM?) .\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo finally we get into the **other bullshit** Intel makes. I don't really give a fuck about it to be honest, it makes up pretty **little of their actual revenue**. They have really overpriced SSDs called Optane that nobody uses because its stupid and like 5x what Samsung's flash is priced at. They also have like the NUC, New Unit of Computing, which is like a Windows Mac Mini that doesn't suck, but who cares. And lastly, I'm gonna mention that Intel is going to attempt to try and make GPUs to compete with the likes of Nvidia and AMD, but they're gonna suck and be overpriced because Intel doesn't know how to make GPUs and they legit tried the exact same thing in 2009 and it completely flopped. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm done. Hopefully y'all made it this far. Good on you if you did. Make some tendies off this shit. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR: Buy $INTC puts faggot**", "id": "acdgyq", "created_utc": 1546569397.0, "score": 167, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 73, "comments": [{"body": "Is it good for $MU though?", "score": 47, "replies": [{"body": "Everything is both good and bad for $MU", "score": 29, "replies": [{"body": "He cracked the code everybody", "score": 5, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "No, because $MU P/E will never be realized by Wall Street and the gay Jim Cramers", "score": 6, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "“Dear Faggots,”\n\nSay no more, take my upvote lol", "score": 71, "replies": [{"body": "I held out til “spergs”", "score": 6, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "So if I understand correctly, we should go long on Intel?", "score": 21, "replies": [{"body": "Amazing timing.
