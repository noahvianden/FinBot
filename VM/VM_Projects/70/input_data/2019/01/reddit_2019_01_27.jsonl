{"title": "GOOGL insider info", "selftext": "Ok, I work in Silicon Valley and am close with a guy who works on Google’s deepmind project. I was actually able to watch the recent Starcraft 2 replays before the news got out due to him, cool guy. Anyway, for years he’s been going on about how trading as we know it is finished as soon as deepmind is unleashed into the financial world. We recently got drinks together and he got a bit too tipsy and tearfully confided in me that he’s actually chief lead of the project and that things aren’t going well. Apparently, across all the simulations deepmind is making a ton of money for months and months (like up thousands and thousands of percent) but then somehow, as the algorithm is sorting through recourses online, it eventually finds WSB and then he said the next trading day it usually all-in’s FDs on shitty companies like MU, JD, or NBEV and then it’s all over. Dude was pretty broken up about it, said they can’t find a way around it. Anyway, there’s my insider information, maybe short $GOOGL. Deepmind is here, do what you will with that information.
