The AAPL lawsuits have put a massive drag on the stock for years. Think what that being resolved can do for their guidance. Plus we’re likely to see a wave of analyst PT upgrades.\n\nWhen stocks have crazy pops it can be really tempting to grab puts but it’s usually a bad idea, in my experience. Look at XLNX, TTD, MDB, CMG - all had massive 20%+ jumps and have yet to look back. More recently DIS taught some people here the same lesson. Don’t short new highs and don’t buy new lows.", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 15, "replies": [{"body": "Can you explain trading channel further?\nI know generally what it is (a sequence of growth or decline) but how to identify and stuff?", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "A simplification is simply the pattern a stock is moving and identifying the 'inflection points' ie the price where it finds support (people buying) or resistance (people selling). In the short term the inflection points will get higher if the stock is one the upswing, or lower if a stock is on a downswing. Stocks that trade generally sideways are great since they're generally more predictable in their pattern.\n\nIt's important to note that these patterns are always limited a catalyst will alter them, with the stock breaking out to a new channel. So for QCOM it broke out heavy to the upside. In the short term it's difficult to say where the consistent support will be vs resistance, especially with their ER coming up. So with QCOM in the short term, $77 was big support. It broke $77 briefly on Wednesday and the shares were bought up immediately. The resistance was $80 but that looks like it's going to break before ER. Look at Thursday and see how many times it hit $80 and broke it, only to see immediate selling pressure downwards.\n\nSo people buying puts on QCOM are idiots. Sure it could see a sell off, I can't see the future, but in the short term there is no evidence of that. For QCOM to even begin selling off you'll need to see the markets start tanking, causing the fear to set in. If I was gonna play QCOM on Monday I would buy short term $81 calls and definitely sell them before ER.\n\nSorry if my answer sucked, I really didn't touch on a long term pattern. I'll try to get back to this comment and post examples, charts.
