The \"better formula\" as you say would depend entirely on the circumstances of the firm that is being valued and an informed investor would tailor their approach accordingly, i.e. not using the same discount rate for every company. The fundamental theory behind WACC is simply that a company has two ways to generate capital; equity or debt. Thus, we discount cash flows using both cost of equity and cost of debt proportioning based on the firm's capital structure.
