{"title": "$AMD. Do not miss out earnings calls 30.4.2019 after market close!", "selftext": "**Update: TOLD u SO ;) gratz to all people who listened to me :) no need to thank me, glad that i could help, Lets sqeeze those shorts :)**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI make a lot of dough from Qualcomm, and AMD i have also made alot of dough on AMD since last year ($10 (januar 2018) to current $28 ish). The rocket still has alot of fuel. This will be an epic money machine people should not miss out!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Intel earnings show clearly some weakness. Numbers do not lie. AMD took alot from them outselling on comsumers market 2-1. Amazon, Microsoft, Google etc. has increase AMD offering in Datacenter. Microsoft have no problem increase datacenter, that means AMD took the % on marketshare with old tech. So AMDs Q2-Q3-Q4 will hammer Intel really hard.\n2. READ Intel SEC filings. They wrote AMD is a Threat. Their last CEO said its his job to keep AMD under 20 % (current 5 % i predict 10 % already and 25-35 % by end of year).\n3. Intel somehow thinking that they can buy time and still tell us that 10nm is coming and on schedule. Its like telling you that star citizen will be realease soon. Its just a fake PR stunt. Low volume and nothing for show.\n4. Intel Can not compete until 2022!\n5. AMD will be able to produce and out price Intel. Intel will keep priced and not lower much since they lose profit and  margins. But you can only for so long fool people. Companies also thinking alot about their cost and saving money from AMD is no brainer.\n6. Notice all the AMD notebook. Super computers wins. And more cloud offerings from the cloud providers. Intel manage to \"fake news\" they cant meet demand is very fake news. They made so many bad decisions and do not know what to do. All over the place.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAm telling you no, do not miss out on AMD! This is free money.
