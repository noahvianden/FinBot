{"title": "Buy Disney Calls Before Disney+ Launches?", "selftext": "Hi, I only started investing a couple months ago and only figured out what options were this week, so forgive me if some of this is dumbshit.\n\nBasically, I’ve been thinking about buying call options for Disney expiring in January under the impression that Disney will surge after Disney+ launches. I think it’ll be extremely popular with families who are used to their kids watching shit like Frozen every single day, more so than Netflix currently is since Netflix doesn’t have anything on par with Disney properties.\n\nI also figure that they’ll hype the service up a lot during the rollout, which will include bragging about not just content but also initial subscription number and how often things will get streamed. Even if the service isn’t a game changing success, they’ll present it as one well into the holidays to sell subscriptions as Christmas gifts.\n\n(Then you also have Frozen 2 and Star Wars coming out in the same timeframe, along with holiday merchandising sales, shoring up their traditional revenue.)\n\nThat led to me to think I should buy calls expiring in January, since calls expiring sooner are cheaper and I’d expect the hype to die down in January anyway. \n\nBreak evens for that range are like in the high $130s into the mid $140s. Currently Disney is at around $131, and its 52 week high is $147.\n\nAlso they have an earning report on 11/7, if that matters at all.\n\nI’ve got $57k in Robinhood, so I figure I’d invest $50k into calls and hope for the best.

People sell after a launch of something and don't buy in until it proves itself with numbers. Their stock will mostly be tied to earnings reports with number of users added being primary metric that the stock price reacts to. \n\nWith that said, their stock is generally pretty stable so there are a lot worse things to get long dated calls in, most probable case you keep losing time premium, but not much to a sliding stock price. They also will tend to follow market gains. So if fed is nice next week and earnings reports and econ data is good then we'll likely break all time highs and continue the rally upward until end of year. DIS will likely ride that wave to a minimum of 136 stock price. At that point you could sell your calls for a nice gain.\n\nI would not put all 50k into this one play though. You never know, regardless of stock, things can happen and if something happened and it lost 10% you would lose it all. Use max 15k in this play.\n\n----\n\nNow for a personal story from a long time trading. \n\nI started my trading with about 60k like you. I did well, got some gains, but am now overall down, and not in a good spot. Some people might kill themselves with some of the losses I've had. And I have felt bad at times. But I've learned so much that it was worth it. I know if I ever save up enough to get back to where I began, I can do well. But I'll tell you this, me doing well will not be by using options.\n\nI've traded it all. Stocks with my money. Stocks leveraged with hundreds of thousands of dollars of margin. Options, selling and buying. Shorting. And futures. I think only thing I haven't tried is forex. \n\nThe number one losing proposition with the most odds stacked against you out of all of those is buying options. The greeks make these things a losing game. Even futures are much safer to trade because there are no greeks. Highly margined stocks are even safe as long as you diversify.\n\nSo take it from me. Don't get too attracted to options. If you're really looking for large and quick gains, options aren't the only game in town. You can make it big in a myriad of ways with 60k capital. You absolutely do not have to leverage options.\n\nNow for my top tips to help you.\n\n1) Diversify positions. This may start easy enough, but then you see one of your positions is a loser so you decide to average down so you pour more into it. Soon enough one of your positions far outweighs the others. Don't do that, which leads me to number two.\n\n2) Cut losses instead of averaging down. Not everything can be a winner. If you were wrong, get out. Not to say, never average down, but never go past a certain percentage of your overall money in any one thing. \n\n3) Ease into positions. If you are willing to do 10% of your money in something, do 2% to start, reevaluate then either cash out or put 2% more, etc.\n\n4) Keep use of time based instruments (buying calls/puts) to a minimum. If you must leverage, use margin or futures. They are safer primarily due to less timing issues. You can nibble at positions and hold longer until things turn your way.\n\n5) Don't get greedy. I wish for my days of having 60k to trade with. Oh what I know I could do with that now. But at the time, it seemed like so little. It seemed like no gain was enough. I wanted some big home run. I needed to have a big trade every day. Know this, 60k is a lot of money. And know this too, 60k is even more money when you're a smart market trader that stays patient.\n\n6) Cash out gains into your bank account weekly or monthly otherwise you'll throw it back i  the market and might lose it. Whenever you gain past your 60k, just deposit that difference. 60k in the market is more than enough.", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "Wow, thanks for the thoughtful response!

They really advocate against buying options but have some research that supports that selling options is way more profitable.  Do you agree?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Yes, selling is just fine, but only if covered. What that means is that you own the stock when selling calls, or are shorting the stock if selling puts. If you sell them and don't own the underlying you can be in for huge losses because you'll have to buy the stock at current market value then sell for the strike you sold the call for, so if the spread is more than the premium you received you lose. For puts, reverse that logic. You agree to buy at strike, if you aren't shorting then you'll have to buy at strike and if current market price is way below then you'll lose. However, in the put case, it isn't an immediate realized loss, so you could technically wait and the stock could recover. \n\nThe right way to sell calls, or puts, is to own the underlying at some price point, then sell the call or put above or below some price that would make sense so that you make money through premium if it goes the way you predict, or if it doesn't go your way you still make money, but have to part with your shares. \n\nThe risk of this strategy is of course that you have to own the shares or be shorting them, so if it moves drastically in the wrong direction then you'll be down and have to wait for the stock to recover or take your loss. As it moves against you it also becomes increasingly hard to sell calls that will return anything substantial (because you won't want to sell a call for example, that would get your stock called away for a large realized loss). The other risk of this strategy is that if you sell a call for example 1% out of the money, then the next day the stock rises 20%, you capped your gains at your premium you received plus whatever your gain of stock price to strike price is. You could miss out on like 19% gains. So it's best to do this strategy on stocks you don't anticipate will move like that. However, premium will be less on stable stocks, so you won't make as much. Best case scenario selling options would be, with little risk, would be when volatility is high so you receive a large premium and to have the stock somehow not move much or move for you so you could buy back the option cheap, then have it reverse in your favor.\n\nWhen I get more money like I had before this is exactly the strategy that I would recommend to get consistent gains. I started doing this, but a little too late. I make decent money, but more capital you have the better it'll work.", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Great comment full of useful information.
