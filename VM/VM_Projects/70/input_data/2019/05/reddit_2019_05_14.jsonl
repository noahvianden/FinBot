A high short float is only good for those long a stock when there is a high probability of there being a news event revealing something that will, in the short-term, lead to material changes to a business’s core financial metrics; a short squeeze only happens when shorts “fold” and cover their positions. This is unlikely to happen in the case of Tesla; I can assure you that Tesla is not being shorted by firms with weak hands, and there is, as of yet, no indication whatsoever that Tesla’s claim of future profitability is anything but a mirage, even though they already seem to have scaled up production to levels sufficient to meet virtually all current demand and have already achieved many things they claimed would lead to an avalanche of demand (i.e. $30,000 model 3), which of course never materialized. Full self-driving capability (for any automaker) is likely decades away, and experts in the industry are almost unanimous in their agreement that FSD is unlikely to even be possible with current Tesla hardware, due to the absence of LIDAR. In any case, it’s pretty widely accepted that Tesla’s autonomous driving capabilities are not even close to being the most advanced in the industry; both Waymo and GM are believed to have a significant edge on Tesla in that arena. Their build quality is decidedly inferior when compared to other big automakers; look at the number of Teslas that are rejected upon delivery for paint damage, panel gapping, etc.  and then compare those numbers to those from an automaker like Honda. Additionally, the interior quality is inferior, in my experience, to that of other luxury brands like BMW and Mercedes, which have the same target market. Tesla’s biggest hurdle, however, is that it has no enduring competitive moat in the EV or AV space, and will come under significant pressure in the next year or two when luxury automakers like Audi and BMW begin releasing mass-market luxury EVs. Overall, the kool-aid is believing that execution has been flawless, when it’s been anything but; look over their 10Ks if you sincerely doubt that. And last quarter wasn’t just “bad,” it was disastrous, especially given that Tesla was supposed to be turning a profit quarter after quarter beginning last year.

All these dumbasses look for is quarter over quarter performance and can't even spot the technology trend and disruption.  Even worse they are \"investing\" on emotion now and claim fraud when their thesis gets busted.  With the type of technological sophistication these products have and the market disruption they are creating, this 40b valuation is a joke, especially when you look at revenues/revenue growth.  The fact is, this stock is being depressed and manipulated by wall st and hedge funds which makes this a fantastic opportunity for retailers that aren't emotional and can understand the game.  \n\nBut, let's just entertain that for the first time in their history, these TSLA bears are right.  Do you think there's no way that Elon finds another company that will buy them out?  Do you think he wouldn't pull from his vast resources and networks of friends and just let Tesla die?  Apple,with 200b cash and their own failing auto division, wouldn't buy them out?  Google, who tried once already, wouldn't try and buy their closest competitor in the self driving sector?  That's what I really don't understand.  I know these guys are short selling on emotion now but really, what is the actual upside here?

Sure, some people will buy electric cars, but not everyone; there’s a reason demand for Teslas in the United States has quite literally fallen off a cliff, and it’s called market saturation. Tesla has done nothing over the last decade but lose billions of dollars; the only reason it hasn’t gone bankrupt is because in the last Elon has been quite successful at “selling the dream” to investors to prop the share price up while diluting the stock; obviously, they’re no longer convinced.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "SpaceX has virtually nothing to do with Tesla except for the fact that the same person is the CEO, lol.  This same person that is supposedly \"selling the dream\".  This is incorrect.  He is making the dream a reality.  No matter how you want to paint Tesla as a failing company the fact is, it is succeeding and succeeding at a very fast pace.  It is very common now to see 3 or 4 Teslas on any given drive if you're living on the coast (many more if in California).  Automakers are now tripping over themselves to catch up in the EV space.  Autopilot has changed the way people drive and those half a million cars (and growing) are training that software to be fully autonomous in the future.  Sure they had a bad quarter but that's such a minor speed bump.  But to the bears, they have to scream bankruptcy and demand cliff because a lot of them had been bleeding out the ass and probably got margin called on the 420 funding secured stunt (which is hilarious.  Elon gladly paid the 20m or whatever. I bet he still laughs about it). \n\nThe only reason this company isn't valued rationally is because some douchebag short sellers (chanos, Einhorn, and co) decided to go for the short and distort play after Tesla acquired solar city.  Then they essentially got wrecked on the first squeeze and it's been personal ever since.  Now they have the media and whoever else trying to do their bidding.  You can tell it's personal by the amount of hate and emotional rants the TSLAQ crowd posts with on social media.  Every time I see some Tesla bear on CNBC state their thesis it's usually making statements that are untrue and delivered incoherently, everytime.  Then, you see people that actually understand technology, disruption, and can speak coherently actually praise Tesla, only to be called \"fanboys\" and delusional.  At some future point in time there will be a tipping point where the technology, product, brand, and financials of this company will be too much for the market manipulators to overcome.  Until then, you will see posts like this saying \"losing money\", \"selling the dream\", \"fanboys\", \"bankruptcy!!!\", etc.  Make no doubt about it, that day will come.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "> SpaceX has virtually nothing to do with Tesla except for the fact [blah blah blah]\n\nSpace X is the ace up Tesla's sleeve.
