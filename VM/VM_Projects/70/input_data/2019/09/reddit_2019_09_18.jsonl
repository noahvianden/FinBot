I'm sure there will be a short lived spike the next day.  As contracts come in over time, MSFT will of course gain value, and I'm actually very long MSFT.  Cloud adoption for the US Government is very complicated, and although this would definitely remove a major hurdle, the path to the cloud for Uncle Sam will not be quick.  And even if some organizations contract quickly, the cloud revenue is paid annually over time, not at once.\n\nI dunno.
