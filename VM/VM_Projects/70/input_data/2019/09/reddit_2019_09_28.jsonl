Waymo's *actual* cars on the street are using much \nmore expensive 64-channel units that go for tens of thousands of dollars.\n- The 92 TOPS performance of Google's TPU1 is on an idealized benchmark workload, while Tesla's HW3 AI chip can sustain full inference processing performance for all large neural networks that fit into its huge internal SRAM.\n- Power draw of FSD hardware is a significant mass market viability factor: EVs running FSD hardware with ~500W power draw of a Google or Nvidia AI chip comparable to Tesla's will suffer an everyday range reduction of ~5%, or an EV range drop from 300 miles to 285 miles. Tesla's low power AI chip with a 100W power envelope reduces the range loss below ~1% on typical urban trips.\n- Power draw of FSD hardware is even worse on gascars, due to the very low efficiency of converting gasoline to electricity: there's a significant range drop and emissions increase on self-driving gascars with any sort of competitive FSD hardware...\n- I haven't even gone into the architectural and weather sensitivity lead that Tesla has due to not using LIDAR.\n\nThe table makes it abundantly clear how many \"FSD moats\" Tesla has built in the 3 years since parting with MobilEye: FSD hardware cost base about an order of magnitude lower than Waymo, an actual FSD data collection rate ~2 orders of magnitude larger than Waymo, deployment rate ~2 orders of magnitude higher than Waymo, fleet size ~3 orders of magnitude higher.\n\nTesla is probably just months away from putting the final FSD pieces in place and to activate the HW3 based neural networks: traffic light and traffic sign recognition to make point-to-point FSD trips feature complete, and then to refine it with the fleet learning process in the quarters to follow.\n\nAnd here's the kicker, while Morgan Stanley is valuing Waymo at 105 billion dollars, guess what Morgan Stanley's valuation for Tesla's FSD business is: [only **8.5 billion dollars**](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-tsla-full-self-driving-tech-undervalued-morgan-stanley/) ...\n\nIMO a big valuation correction is in order once the market properly processes these facts and realities.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "To be fair I would actually give Waymo, Wework, and Uber a valuation of 0.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "That's certainly one way for the market to correct the mis-pricing.", "score": 0, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "Is anyone else worried that somebody might get hurt by Enhanced Summon and the resulting media shit storm and inevitable lawsuits will affect the share price?", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "It's certainly a concern.
