If nothing else, airbus will be in a really good position no matter what. If boeing recovers, it might not recover all its market share in the commercial space, and being that airbus is pretty much the only competitor, its going to see gains. Even if BA completely recovers its position (unlikely) airbus will still be fine. \n\nWhen q4 comes out, boeing is going to look real bad but it won't be unexpected. If in Q1 BA sees a lot of cancellations and is left with unsold stock in their yard, there's going to be a serious hit. If the Max isn't approved by February, there's going to be a LOT of talk about how much this hurts them, and halfway through Q2 there could be a serious buying opportunity.\n\nThere's talk about buying manufacturers right now, which is dumb. BA's supply pipeline is going to be hurt real bad. They have stock waiting to go to the customer now, so recovery there might not even begin to happen until Q3 2020. In the meantime, those producers will be struggling and have no one to sell to but Airbus, who will have sole discretion over what they want to pay.
