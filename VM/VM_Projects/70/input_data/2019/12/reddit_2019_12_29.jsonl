A few strikes out and you are depending on retail overreacting to some piece of news enough to squeeze shorts.  Gabor the Blind guy wasn’t enough to make that happen so it would likely take real news.  ACB has limited exposure to US market but if US legalized on federal level it would moon.

Hell even if it dropped to $1 you would only see a 66% return.  Selling puts has some merit unless retail decides they had enough.  \n\nSince there seems to be a post every 8 hours on this stock ever since Gabor the Blind Guy because WSB famous.  Let’s review where the company is at before we create anymore bag holders or yacht owners.\n\nACB is currently trading at its lowest price since October of 2017, back before Recreational Pot was legal in Canada, and was trading around $10 as recently as first quarter this year.  So in this year where stocks only went up it dropped 80%.\n\nSo that should mean it’s primed for recovery to the moon right?  Except there were good reasons that it dropped.  It made a lot of acquisitions by issuing shares and those acquisitions were definitely buying overpriced assets at the top of their value as demonstrated by the $3b CAD of goodwill sitting on their books.  Then back in November they further diluted shares by converting debt to shares.\n\nBack when they were $2 in 3rd quarter 2017  they had 371m shares outstanding, as of right now that number is around 1.1b.  So even if they miraculously found a deal that would be worth a billion dollars the value is about $1 a share.\n\nWhen you hear discussion about money mismanagement this is part of what they are talking about.  The other part is construction of two new growing facilities that was started and subsequently stopped.  Over the past 18 months they have invested over 300m into two giant facilities to increase capacity.  However as the past two quarters have demonstrated the Canadian market is currently oversupplied.  It’s building ice makers to sell ice to eskimos up in Canada.\n\nCombine those factors and you have a ton of cash burn, combine that with limited revenue and you have people talking about the company going out of business.  Short sellers have noticed and account for a third of the volume in the market for awhile now.\n\nWhich brings us to you the Yahoo article that was posted recently with a price target of zero.  First off fuck that guy he cost me some money, second of all he was kind of right about their balance sheet although extremely pessimistic and ignored a few pretty important facts.  \n\nHis theory was that because of cash burn ACB would run out of money within two quarters due to limited capacity for lending.  They have $152m in cash and burned through 130m in previous quarter and only have lending capacity on their line of credit of another 150m.  So the idea being they do that for 2 more quarters and boom out of money and no more access to banks because their balance sheet is already carrying too much debt.  \n\nExcept the converted half of their debentures in November which accounted for 30m in payments in each quarter and halted construction on the two additional greenhouse which in most recent quarter accounted for at least 50m of that cash burn, possibly more.  Now they also had an influx of 80m last quarter from selling securities.  That’s page 8 of below.\n\nhttps://assets.ctfassets.net/rhxhcf3cql1g/7p3Er952vcGekZovryfU7y/6969db5521c23a7f172d96805e5876e5/FS_2019.09.30_11.14.2019.pdf\n\nHowever on page 18 you can see the book value on construction in progress went up by 90m.\n\nSo in a best cash scenario that burn would drop by $30-40m at existing revenue.  $30m less in payments on the debenture and $90m less on construction but not getting 80m from selling securities.  Which drops their cash burn down into the $80-90m range with $300m available before needing more cash or issuing shares.  That’s also on existing revenue.  So yeah fuck that guy.\n\nWhich brings us to recent news insider selling.  A director sold 4m shares and then asking Cam Battley their CCO to step down.  It’s been speculated that they moved him to fit in a Coke exec, I would say look at the past 9 months and tell me if you would demote someone that presided over your stock dropping 80% by buying a bunch of overpriced assets and building ice makers in Canada.  I would banish him to Australia as well. \n\nSo they have a rough balance sheet, have dealt with a tough roll out in Canada and have demoted a c-suite guy.  All of moves look right for a turn around to profitability especially now that edibles and vapes have rolled out in Canada.  There are reasons to believe they can turn it around long term, however with the share dilution a trip to the moon is really damn unlikely.\n\nHowever it’s of significant note that ACB is the most heavily owned stock on Robinhood right now which means you have a significant number of retail bag holders in play.  The fact that the stock dropped like a stone and it’s still number one implies that there are still a significant number of those 1b shares floating around.  Looking at how a yahoo article impacted the price, it’s likely safe to say you can’t expect any rational activity from this group.\n\nTL:DR:  Any calls should be kept closer to strike as mooning depends on some weird shit happening and dilution will hold it down.  A few strikes out and you are depending on retail overreacting to some piece of news enough to squeeze shorts.  Gabor the Blind guy wasn’t enough to make that happen so it would likely take real news.  ACB has limited exposure to US market but if US legalized on federal level it would moon.

ACB is over 50% of its total assets. Its extremely hard for long term companies positioned in older industries to even recoup that amount. And for a new company with questionable management in an even more questionable industry it's even worse. Ever heard of a writedown? Because having 50% of your assets in goodwill typically has a writedown following it if the company cant significantly lower its % of it.\n\nNeed more facts- it would take roughly 25 quarters for them to get close to just paying off the goodwill/intangible and that's if their profits were 100 mill a quarter. And that's just for recouping(you could probably lower that. Say 12-16 quarters as often acquisitions don't recoup all the goodwill/intangibles until way later if at all).\n\n\nAlso their shares are heavily diluted. \n\n\nIf your going to invest in weed stocks atleast invest in the ones who arent super diluted or have extremely questionable financials.
