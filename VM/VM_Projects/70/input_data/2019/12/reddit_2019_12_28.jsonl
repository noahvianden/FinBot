I.e. your true collateral requirement is 130%, not 30%.\n\nNow in the case of Spiegel the net collateral requirements depend on his entry price for TSLA: if he had an average entry price of say $250 (a lot of shorts redoubled their stakes between $200 and $250), and a collateral requirement of 102%, then at $380 he'd already have to post another 52% of his TSLA position to maintain it, beyond the cash he got for the initial short sale.\n\nSince TSLA was 20% of his fund, I can very much see him running out of collateral - the 100%+ rise in TSLA was brutal.\n\nHe was also writing naked calls, which costs a lot of collateral as well as the price rises - could have been easily beyond the collateral cost of the TSLA short position.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Why do you think im talking about **Margin.**\n\nThe 102% thing is for SBL desks who borrow shares and do all kinds of delta 1 transactions, not for individual investors / funds who have margin accounts with the broker.

He had 20% of his fund in that position. Let's assume his fund was worth $10m at that stage, and $2m worth of TSLA short position was a 10,000 TSLA shares short position. His broker has a maintenance margin requirement of 30%. His initial margin requirement would be $2.6m - he'd have to post this much cash and securities, probably with a haircut for securities. (Let's ignore Regulation B and other details to keep to round numbers.)\n- When TSLA rose to $300, and he was still short 10,000 shares, his margin requirements ballooned to $3.9m - he'd have to have to post another $1.3m in collateral. Painful but doable.\n- When TSLA rose to just under $400, the margin requirements ballooned to $5.2m - **over 50% of his initial funds**. He faced a \"collateral squeeze\": he'd have to post another $2.6m over his initial margin. Instead of posting more collateral (which he likely didn't have) he closed half of his TSLA short position at a $1m loss, but this reduced his margin requirements from $5.2m to $2.6m.\n\nBut it's worse than that: Spiegel also admitted **that he wrote naked TSLA calls**, of an unknown quantity. Writing naked calls can generate immediate cash and can be a nice theta income stream if you are right that the stock has a ceiling, but they are incredibly dangerous instruments that can appreciate in value exponentially if the stock goes significantly higher - which it did at the end of 2019.\n\nIMO these probably explain why he closed all the *other* profitable short positions instead of letting them run - this too freed up collateral.\n\nI.e. my original point stands: his letter had \"collateral squeeze\" written all over it.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "You keep confusing borrowing shares and actually shorting them and collateral and margin.

I just bought them yesterday morning and some this morning and im up a little thus far.  Everyone keeps saying \"they're gonna expire worthless\" and \"its an awful bet\"  but theyre drastically outpacing every analyst estimates, the overall market, and generally straight up with no pullbacks.  The past couple days its showed weakness, and I expect profit taking going into the New year.  \n\nId like to say I am long term Bullish obviously, Im just in this for the pullback.  Should they fall close to their respective support areas, I will go long then.  I am hoping for a pullback going into ER and to collect the Premium then dump it all before ER.  The only way I dont sell into ER is if they have only slightly pulled back and its not at a floor.  I find it highly unlilely they wont experience a significant pullback based on previous chart patterns where they tend to sky rocket then fall harshly and rebound.  \n\nAs well, their respective financial positions do not really support their valuations.  In a dream scenario, they pullback significantly running into ER and then long into ER, or straddle atleast.  Playing it by ear and might sell monday if it shoots to new ATH but as of now Im holding until further news.  I also have a small stock positon in TVIX that ill prolly sell soon.
