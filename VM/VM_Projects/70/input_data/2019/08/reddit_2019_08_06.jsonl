{"title": "Guide: How to make guaranteed gains off a crash", "selftext": "Ok so apparently if you put 2k on SPY puts you make 70k when the market tanks - I dunno for sure I didn‚Äôt read the thread but that‚Äôs what I took away from the Robin Hood screenshot. Now unfortunately the market doesn‚Äôt tank everyday so you need some sort of strategy to profit. \n\nYou need a sizeable portion of money to start. 50k should do. Now every two weeks buy 2k worth of OTM puts on SPY. Since the market takes a shit like once a year minimum you should profit 70k at least once. You might end up making 70k like 3 times if you‚Äôre lucky. And plus if you start with 50k you get to try this every two weeks for a full year which pretty much guarantees you‚Äôll turn a profit.\n\nSomeone try this out and if you make money please send me it.\n\nOk thanks for reading my guide.", "id": "cml66r", "created_utc": 1565061082.0, "score": 319, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 65, "comments": [{"body": "I think you just described the \"game plan\" for most of WSB.
