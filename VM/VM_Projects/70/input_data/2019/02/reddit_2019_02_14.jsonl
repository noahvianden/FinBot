{"title": "🚀🚀🚀 Why the market will not stop rising (sorry bears) 🚀🚀🚀", "selftext": "Okay guys, since everyone seems to want to hate on my S&P 2800 call (despite the fact that I've been calling the up move) let me lay it out really clearly for you:\n\na) In the near term, ahead of a long weekend, no one will want to be short when Mnuchin / China meeting could yield a trade deal.  That would rocket the market up +2-3% immediately.\n\nb) Merrill Lynch reported that institutional investors have the highest level of cash in 10 years, meaning that there's plenty of incremental buyers (that NEED to get invested) to continue pushing this higher.\n\nc) For those of you thinking that just because we're up 17% in effectively a straight line on no news -- we'll you're wrong. The only thing that matters is the fed, and the fed did an about face and will likely be EASING instead of TIGHTENING as thought before. That's the game changer. If you want to fight the fed, let me know how that has worked out over the past 6 years.\n\nd) Economic data isn't great (like last year), but it's not horrible either. Citi's economic surprise indicator is INFLECTING to the upside, meaning that positive surprises are coming, which are NOT priced in. Unless you think we're going into a recession in the next 18 months (SPOILER: we're not), then the macro picture should be a tailwind due to said surprises to the upside.\n\ne) PE levels are still below historical averages.\n\nf) Finally and most importantly, if a \"global slowdown\" begins taking a toll on our economy, the fed will backstop us. Fine, it's not the same \"fed put\" that was under the market ever the past few years, but we have plenty of arrows in the quiver to provide a soft landing for the US Economy.\n\nBears -- come at me.\n\n\n", "id": "aqparn", "created_utc": 1550182013.0, "score": 73, "upvote_ratio": 0.77, "num_comments": 74, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 43, "replies": [{"body": "Consensus is that they are holding rates before their next action, which is expected to be a cut", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "If the fed lowers rates I'll eat my ass", "score": 53, "replies": [{"body": "Saved, if the Fed's next action is to lower rates u/bobloadmire will eat their (u/bobloadmire's) ass.", "score": 13, "replies": []}, {"body": "Proof or ban.

The market is pricing in a rate cut this year as you say, but the market mispriced for the Fed hike in December too – the market's pricing of these things do not influence the Fed and have nothing to do with what the Fed is actually deciding, it is only the result of the collective wishes and dreams of other autists, who again just totally fucked the pooch in December on their guess.  While admittedly very speculative, my best guess is there will be no Fed rate cut this year **UNLESS** something breaks horribly first.  March I bet strongly for the Fed to do nothing, but June ... at the moment I would give a non-zero probability of another 25 basis-point rate-hike (unless something serious breaks between now and then), a better probability then I would give to a rate cut.  Meanwhile, in the background, QT is going at full speed destroying up to $50 billion a month and only one Fed governor so far has suggested that maybe it should stop sometime before the start of 2020 (but not necessarily soon either).  So while the Fed is trying to be cautious and sound dovish, your expectations for its dovishness this year I think are vastly overblown, and you are in a boat with a lot of other like minded individuals which will make the fallout of the Fed \"surprise\" that much more bearish when it happens later this year.\n\n**d)** \"Economic data isn't great (like last year), but it's not horrible either.\"  It is true that it could recover, but things are starting off in the shitter for 2019 in terms of critical economic data.

Just wait for the fallout from Brexit and a bunch more macro surprises to the downside to kick in later this year.\n\n**e)** \"PE levels are still below historical averages.\"  Are you kidding? [Shiller-PE](http://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe/) has only been on a higher spike around 1929's black Tuesday and the 2001 dot-com bust.  ... and  EPS is projected to go down this year which would imply that unless stock prices fall EPS will be getting even worse in 2019.\n\n**f)** ... maybe.
