But canopy is one of the only companies that have a solid investment from a company with a great product.

Once you pass on, the federal student debts in your name are discharged. To receive this discharge, your survivors need to present a certified death certificate to the loan servicer.\n\nIf you have Parent PLUS Loans\n\nParent PLUS borrowers are also eligible for a death discharge, since PLUS loans are federal loans.\n\nFleischman added that for Parent PLUS Loans, it’s the parent — not the student — who is legally obligated to repay the loan. “These loans can be discharged when either the parent or the student dies,” he explained. “Discharged federal student loan obligations won’t pass to your estate, and your heirs won’t have to pay them off.”\n\nRealize, though, that there are tax consequences associated with the death discharge of a Parent PLUS Loan due to the student’s death. Parents receive a 1099-C form from the IRS after the debt is canceled. The remaining debt canceled is treated as taxable income. So parents in this situation could be hit with a large tax bill.\n\nIf you have private student loans\n\nIf you have private student loans, things get a bit trickier. Some private student loan lenders do offer a death discharge, but not all of them.\n\nPrivate student loans, including refinanced loans, are more like traditional personal loans. As with other types of debt, private lenders might come for your estate when you die. However, if the loans are only in your name, your children or other relatives aren’t generally considered liable, according to Credit.com.\n\nIf you have a cosigner\n\nIf your private student loan has a cosigner, which many of them do, you might be in trouble. Your cosigner is legally responsible for your debt after you pass away, regardless of the type of loan in question. And, in some cases, cosigned debt repayment can be accelerated.", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "This is not true.", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "Student loans are forgiven upon death.
