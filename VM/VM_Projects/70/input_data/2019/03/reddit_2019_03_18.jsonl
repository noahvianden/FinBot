A couple reasons. First it seems like the X has simply failed, but if they can keep % iphone sales loss from increasing then this is a positive. iPad sales eod obviously help to offset this. Second, No one is going to buy a not 5G iPhone as we lead up to 5G now, so push iPads. Third, I think Cook will present the iPad as the optional on the go streaming device which may be why he released the mini before the 25th, to offer some package deal. \n\nAlthough I am hopeful of iPad sales Im really unsure. One thing that that the market may not like is if the streaming service is offered for free or at an extreme discount. The pricing & the special packages (buy iPad get free streaming for a year...) will be, IMO, the catalyst coming out of the 25th; unless there's more behind the curtain? (Potentially an exclusive feature film or TV show announcement?)\n\nI hold 190c for this Friday and 200c for april 5. I'm really not hopeful going into the announcement on monday as it'll also be the perfect time for the market to take a pause if it continues up this week on Fed dovishness tomorrow.
