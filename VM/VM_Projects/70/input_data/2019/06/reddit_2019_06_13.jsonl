{"title": "JPM Set To Breakout", "selftext": "JPM is set to breakout, as early as tomorrow, in anticipation of rate cuts\n Its high is around 117. It has tested 112 in the last week a couple times. It currently resides around 109. I am guestimating it at least hits 110 tomorrow, or higher. \n\nCalls for tomorrow are cheap at about .20 for 110 strike. A small move will more than double your money. A significat move to retest 112 and it'll be like 5x. Get your calls now.
