Whether you buy at the best or worst time of the year probably doesn't make that huge of a difference many years later. You could time it nicely and get a 10% better entry point, but it's also likely that you end up waiting and buying a dip that's still higher than if you bought early. If you're sitting on a big lump of cash, you can always spread your buys out monthly or quarterly just to average in and reduce the chance and effect of buying at the best or worst times.\n\nNow if you were wondering when to buy into something like Uber or Beyond Meat where the valuation doesn't really make sense and the long term outlook is hazier, I'd be a lot more concerned with 52 week highs.", "score": 89, "replies": [{"body": "Just to add to this..
