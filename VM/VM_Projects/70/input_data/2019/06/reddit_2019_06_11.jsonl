But he talked at length about \"what if Tesla had a demand issue\" and the clickbait sites new that doomsday headlines about Tesla got clicks, so they grabbed his $10 scenario to say \"Morgan Stanley thinks Tesla may be worth $10\"\n\nThat sentence is rendered meaningless because is the \"may\".  Every company may be worth $0 in the right hypothetical.  But it draws clicks and sells ads.\n\nBut I'm also not convinced Jonas moves the market at all.  A lot of his investor call was talking about what he found from conversations with his investors, all of whom were freaking out about Tesla demand.
