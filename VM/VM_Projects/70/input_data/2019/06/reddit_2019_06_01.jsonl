When questions are called into yourgrowth these numbers start to be noticed. Tesla we estimate ended the first quarter withabout $13 billion in gross debt and around $8.4 billion of netdebt. The old saying used togo-well before we had this conversation a year or so ago was substantially less grossdebt than this and the market cap was a hell of a lot larger-and so the gross debt as apercentage of market cap and even net debt as apercentage of market cap is really at alltime highs right now on our numbers at least since at least since the it's been a publiccompany. Gross debt-I'm giving you round numbers-is roughly 50% of revenues. When Isay revenues I mean the 2019 revenueforecasts that are 350,000 unit number. 50% ofrevenues is debt, that compares to about 10% of revenues gross debt at Ford and GM andfor Volkswagen and BMW it's somewhere between gross debt is about 2 to 5%. I mentionthat because on our $10 bear case youknow the EV to sales is almost double Volkswagen. And again I know it's heresy to suggest that you can compare the valuationof Tesla with a genuinely class leading tech and brand positioning to Volkswagen, but youknow if a company is not growing you invite yourself to those comparisons\n\n\n(I must admit, Jonas has been a fascination for me since the model X days.
