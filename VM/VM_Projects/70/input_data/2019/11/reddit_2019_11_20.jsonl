I am just writing about a potential short squeeze I see in the market and how I am currently positioned to take advantage IF that unlikely squeeze ever occurs. Do NOT follow me in this trade. I am not an analyst and I have no clue what I am doing. \n\nI recently bought Jan $35 calls in Peloton. To me, it has many of the same SHARE fundamentals that BYND had after this IPO. (Obviously not business similarities)\n\n1. Relatively low float compared to shares outstanding (40m share float vs 280m total shares locked up until March.\n\n2. Passionate user base that hypes the everloving shit out of the product and preaches how no other competitor is the same as them\n\n3. Due to point 2, a ‚Äúdumb money‚Äù retail base of investors that buy the stock because they like the product, ignoring valuations\n\n4. On trend (subscription based, healthy, the ‚Äúnew‚Äù it product, etc)\n\n5. Insanely overvalued- this is actually a positive because it has led to point 6\n\n6. CRAZY high short interest as a percentage of the float. As of this morning it was 84%. Every ‚Äúsmart money‚Äù investor and trader is looking at this and saying ‚Äúthis POS is a fad and totally overvalued. I‚Äôm going to short it!‚Äù Just like BYND was at $80 when I first bought calls. It definitely WILL crash and burn and come back to earth at some point- but not before wiping out the shorts and causing a squeeze to a valuation deemed ‚Äúludicrous‚Äù \n\nI bought my calls on Monday for between $0.35-$1.00 I believe. \n\nI definitely might be wrong.

The likelihood of a bloated share structure leading to a short squeeze as seen in BYND and TLRY is dismally low, which is why we don't see them happen, which is why PTON is not going to be squeezed $200/$300 a share. **And that's what OP is talking about, ie; will PTON squeeze like BYND/TLRY? No, it won't. Does that mean a short squeeze can still happen and move the price a little? Yes, but that's not \"like BYND/TLRY\".** The tens of millions of extra shares in comparison ensure a lower price to cover if PTON moves against your short position because the float ain't getting swallowed multiple times a day by the street.\n\nWhatever your position, I hope you do well, and I'll be happy to be proven wrong if PTON hits $250.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "7.
