I signed up for the Disney+ trial, spent about 20 minutes exploring it. Kept thinking I was missing 95% of the content, then realized I actually was seeing it all. Very, very limited. It's literally about 0.01% of what Netflix offers. Pretty horrendous. And disappointing. Also, I started Star Wars Episode IV. The video paused four times before R2D2 ran away from Luke's Uncle's place.
