The weight saving is highly speculative at this point, so no point throwing out numbers into the air.  However, there's one big thing that works against Tesla's 7:13 laptime. It wasn't done on an empty track. That's a huge factor on such a narrow and challenging course, like the Nurburgring, with the walls essentially meters away from the track and with amateur drivers present on track. \n\nOverall, my take is that the final Plaid version should be able to easily pull a <7:30 on a normal production spec, on an empty track, in the summer and most likely \\~7:00 for the stripped car with semi-slick tires on.", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "Will the plaid Model S run the 1/4 mile in under 10sec?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I'm betting mid to high 9s range.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Definitely.

It could basically taint all their previous and future runs for a time that is \"on par, but not overly impressive\" compared to all modern Porsches.\n\nThere's a misunderstanding that Porsche cares about nurburgring lap times. Check the [Taycan reveal \\(timestamped\\)](https://youtu.be/NFIefz3xkrU?t=1299) : it's just a number to prove that the Taycan doesn't go into limp mode. Nothing much to boast about (takes less than 10 seconds). You can even hear a couple people clapping at the time, but the presenter just ignores that and keeps talking.\n\nregarding the impact of mods :\n\n- ceramic brakes allow for better braking for longer periods of time. (normal brakes lose braking ability when they get too hot) If you brake better, you can brake later before a corner. Can gain you seconds PER CORNER. Note that there are some very good high-performance metallic brakes too (that track users even prefer over ceramic brakes because they provide close enough performance for a lot less money), but the ceramics are  the \"top trim\" basically.\n\n- general aero : spoiler, diffuser, splitter... are there for better cornering : the higher the speed, the more these will \"push\" the car into the ground. this means that at low speed, the car can accelerate quickly, and at high speed, the car can corner better. a funny example of a car relying a lot on aero is the McLaren P1 chich is a car that underdelivers on slow short tracks (like laguna seca) because it doesn't get enough speed to benefit from it's advanced aero. It needs to go fast to get even faster basically. At the end of the day, these items are also there to improve cornering speed, which can save again a lot of time per corner.\n\nOne thing to note is that the aero has the handicap of making the car \"weigh\" so much more at high speed, that the top-end is impacted. you can see [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCjyxYJiCpY) a McLaren 720s beat a Porsche racecar in a drag race : note that both cars have similar power, torque, Porsche is lighter and is on racing slicks. I'll bet on the Porsche any day of the week if the race is around a track instead of a dragrace though ! a lot of cars have \"active aero\" so the downforce changes depending on your objective : range vs track mode.\n\n- tires are also a HUGE factor that gives benefits in braking, cornering and acceleration ! I think they bring by themselves AT LEAST 30 seconds compared to the Tesla's factory skinny tires. this impacts range significantly too.\n\n\nThis is why the assumption that the \"production spec\" model S will be very different from the one we see today on the 'Ring is very believable : everything we see as an improvement of the model S for the track has a very big impact on range. (maybe except the powertrain) The model S is not a track car, it's meant for long range traveling. In my opinion, the only way these would appear in production would be if Tesla came out with a \"track package\" for the model S as the range would be severely impacted, and it would be much more expensive.\nHowever, it should be differentiated from the performance of the model S just like Porsche differentiates it's \"normal\" 911 carrera from the track 911 GT2RS for example.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "This is great, what an informative reply!\n\nAlso shows how excellent the Taycan is.

They allow better lap times (by better, more consistent braking), but are prohibitively expensive. For reference, it's & $5.5K option when buying a Taycan Turbo, but comes standard with the Turbo S.\n\n> I imagine the tyres are the biggest offender, just from common sense ?\n\ntyres have a very big impact, but aero too : [this article](https://www.roadandtrack.com/car-culture/news/a29151/dodge-viper-acr-towing-economy/) is from someone who brings his track cars on a trailer with his van. when he brings his Viper GTS, he usually has 20-21 mpg. When he brings his Viper ACR (known for generating A LOT of downforce), he gets 18-19 mpg. This is from a EcoDiesel Grand Cherokee, so a car that should have no trouble towing small sportscars.\n\n> But if, of course, those upgrades are nowhere to be seen when the car launches, it is a bit sneaky by the looks of things. \n\nnowadays, aero can be simulated and designed as part of a car in very subtle ways.

I had to pause the project when I lost my @$$ on some AMD FD's. I did well (Thanks PG&E) and just like any responsible adult immediately finished putting my winnings into Gold. Can't go tits up.\n\nI want to thank my fellow autists @ [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) for giving me the advice I needed to lose my money and no good advice to make it back.\n\nThis is a 2011 Honda CBR250R that is anything but stock.  \nIt even has lasers! When the blinkers are on it shines the lasers into the area where I am going.  \nThe rear laser actually does get drivers to stop tailgating.\n\nI purchased the stolen gold from the Mexican government. It was being sold as evidence from a case and I got it for under $60. I was amazed when nobody else bid on it and did the greatest thing I could think of. 6 Layers of gold minimum with what felt like 20 gallons of clear coat.\n\nThe panels were originally too reflective and the gold was absolutely blinding. So I re-layered the clear coat after hitting it with some sandpaper to tone it down a bit. Still came out amazing.\n\nFun Fact :  \nBringing it home from the shop I stopped to fill it and got jumped by a cougar.  \nWoman well over 60 filling at the opposite pump walked up and said, \"I don't normally go for bad boys but, with an all gold motorcycle I might reconsider it.\"  \nAll I could say was, \"Thanks.\"  \nShe replied, \"Let me know if you change your mind.\"  \nI was dying laughing all the way home.  \nMaybe too much attention getting with this bike.  \n\n\nNever forget :  \nAutism is a spectrum and I've gone around twice.", "id": "dreco9", "created_utc": 1572852971.0, "score": 129, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 73, "comments": [{"body": "Give it a week and we'll see a new post from you: 'Crashed my bike, quadriplegic, and $120k in uninsured medical debts.
