About a 2 years ago, they fell due to the bankruptcy of Toys R Us, but held together a lot better than the failing Mattel, and were much better at shifting over to Target, Walmart and Amazon than others in the segment. Over this year, they surged from ~85 to ~120 off the back of Magic the Gathering's new digital \"Magic Arena\". Then, last quarter, they crashed back due to trade war bullshit, completely disregarding the continuing growth of Magic Arena and the upcoming release of Frozen 2. \n\nFrozen 1 was an absurdly huge success. Disney was caught flatfooted for that and brought Hasbro on as a partner for their toy lines pretty late to the party, but it still literally doubled Hasbro's \"girl toys\" sales for the year. This time, Hasbro and Disney have been partnered from the beginning and have already gotten every store to push Frozen 2 toys since the beginning of the month.
