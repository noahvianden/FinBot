{"title": "GM, the next NIO and Tesla", "selftext": "Before you yell at me and say I'm some boomer, hear me out. \n\nTesla and NIO are both rapidly growing, but guess what, per delivery NIO is worth roughly $867,000 per vehicle, Tesla is roughly worth $667,000 per vehicle. GM is worth $1,000 per car or truck sold.\n\nGM has started to [release](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a33352012/gm-electric-cars-cadillac-chevy-buick-hummer-specs/) their EV vehicles as of recently, we know of the 2022 Cadillac Lyriq, 2020 Hummer, and Chevy Bolt. By 2023 they will have 20 new EV, including the buick line, which if you don't know Buick crushes it in the Chinese market. \n\nDid you know that GM sells almost five times more vehicles in China than it does in the US, out-competing any other US competitor easily. Another fun fact, China plans to have 20 percent of their vehicles to be plug-in hybrids or EVs by 2025, by 2030 they want 75%, and 100% by 2035. \n\nThis brings me to the final point and the most important, on **November 19th** GM is to participate in the Barclays 2020 global automotive conference. This is where I am going to speculate that GM will announce that they want to put **fuel cells in their pickups**, which will also be battery powered. This is why they partnered with Nikola to get the tech. \n\nThe fuel cell technology will be used in their vehicles because you will have less weight from the battery, in stop and go traffic the fuel cell will turn a generator to recharge the battery which in the long term will add more battery life from a stable battery charge and will allow longer range on the batteries. If you need an example of this, look up [Oakland Transit](http://www.actransit.org/environment/the-hyroad/), they use this tech on their transit buses. \n\nThey could also reveal Z06 flat plane v8, ZR1 twin turbo v8, and Zora hybrid twin turbo v8. There have been reports of seeing them being tested, once again, a potential of EV for the future. \n\nThey could show more of their future EVs at the event.\n\nThey have also been upgraded by multiple different firms after they just smashed their last earnings to $45-$50 range by multiple analysts. \n\nTLDR - GM will be announcing new EV on Nov 19th at event\n\n40 contracts 11/27 38c\n\nFD - 100 contracts 11/20 45c", "id": "jp89yf", "created_utc": 1604680425.0, "score": 37, "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "num_comments": 73, "comments": [{"body": "This is decently solid logic.
