{"title": "Want to make money? Buy Dell", "selftext": "Dell has earnings on the morning of Tuesday November 24th. Dell is a computer manufacturer along with other technology such as projectors, notebooks, printers, and headphones. You know what this means, at home working. Along with this part of business, it has a CLOUD portion. Yes this boomer stonk has a cloud business by the name of VMW. This allows them not only to sell computers but have a steady cloud business. VMW ware has shown consistent growth, with an average of 12ish % yoy. Cloud has obvious boomed during Covid-19, so you can assume VMW will have great returns this earnings. In addition for VMW, it has partnered with NVDA to make AI chips better.\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vmware-nvidia-partner-ai-chips-120728435.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vmware-nvidia-partner-ai-chips-120728435.html)\n\nNow the PC  sales will be fantastic as shown CSCO, LOGI, and Target. If you did not know all of these companies massively beat earnings. All of them sell computers, headphones, etc. Target is a massive provider for Dell's computers. \n\nNow I know some people will say Dell = Apple! It will miss!\n\nBut, Dell does not sell Iphones and laptops just for money. In addition, Dell is cheaper than Apple. Why would you spend 2k for a new laptop when you have a old one? With Dell, laptops can be under 1000 dollars, and people would want to upgrade for better ones/\n\nThey have a 3 sections.\n\nVMW and computer which I covered but they have storage portion too.\n\nI believe that because school came back, many people brought Dell computers and products for stay-at-home. In addition to VMW and storage revenue. Dell's earnings estimates have barely moved since Q2 and it provides for a great beat.\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pc-sales-continue-benefiting-covid-102110153.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pc-sales-continue-benefiting-covid-102110153.html)\n\nAlso NVDA and AMD's new CPU's and GPU's are in Dell's products. If you wanted a new rtx 3070 or rtx 3080, or rtx 3090, you can buy it in a Dell PC. If you just look at AMD's and NVDA's sales you can tell there is great demand for their chips.\n\nNow onto technicals, Dell broke their march uptrend line but has bounced off the lows and created a new uptrend. It is just below ATH which it failed to break 3 months ago. If earnings beats, it could fucking moon 10% or more. Keep in mind that Dell has gone up on past 3-4 earnings.\n\nNow Dell's IV is low , with just 47%. So you will not get IV crushed that badly. Also, it is not a volatile stock, and max moves down are rarely greater than 4%\n\nAlso there has been lots of buying for Dell calls, on Friday 1750 12/18c were traded\n\nYou want links? here you go\n\n[https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21508481/alienware-rtx-3080-3090-aurora-r11-r10-area-51-monitor-360hz](https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21508481/alienware-rtx-3080-3090-aurora-r11-r10-area-51-monitor-360hz)\n\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/barrycollins/2020/07/10/pc-sales-surge-during-coronavirus-crisisand-hps-the-big-winner/?sh=654c20455227](https://www.forbes.com/sites/barrycollins/2020/07/10/pc-sales-surge-during-coronavirus-crisisand-hps-the-big-winner/?sh=654c20455227)\n\n[https://gadgets.ndtv.com/laptops/news/pc-sales-climb-as-covid-19-pandemic-keeps-consumers-at-home-idc-gartner-2261022](https://gadgets.ndtv.com/laptops/news/pc-sales-climb-as-covid-19-pandemic-keeps-consumers-at-home-idc-gartner-2261022)\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/target-earnings-beat-expectations-11605699139#:\\~:text=Target%20reported%20TKTK&text=Revenue%20of%20%2422.63%20billion%20was,FactSet%20consensus%20of%20%2420.77%20billion.&text=Comparable%20sales%20jumped%2020.7%25%20with,sales%20were%20filled%20by%20stores](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/target-earnings-beat-expectations-11605699139#:~:text=Target%20reported%20TKTK&text=Revenue%20of%20%2422.63%20billion%20was,FactSet%20consensus%20of%20%2420.77%20billion.&text=Comparable%20sales%20jumped%2020.7%25%20with,sales%20were%20filled%20by%20stores).\n\nTLDR: Buy Dell because it's fucking mooning.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n12/18 68c and 12/18 70c", "id": "jz5v21", "created_utc": 1606087017.0, "score": 18, "upvote_ratio": 0.61, "num_comments": 83, "comments": [{"body": "Dude you’re going bankrupt", "score": 65, "replies": [{"body": "Dude you're getting a Dell", "score": 24, "replies": []}, {"body": "Did he?", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "lol, that post didn't age well...", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Dell is still around?
