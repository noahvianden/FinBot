The opinion in this post is ONLY for informational purposes. Do not make financial decisions without doing your own due diligence and forming your own opinion.\n\nSumo Logic (SUMO) \n\nEarnings date: 12/7 After Hours\n\nClosing price (11/18): $19.01\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dp2dkg2gw2061.png?width=1068&format=png&auto=webp&s=85327d356d29999fad27b8756a21635efa096ec7\n\nQuick Facts:\n\n* SUMO is growing quickly and is positioned well to compete in a $50B-$80B market.\n* Cloud native DevSecOps platform is gaining more traction.\n* \\~8.2 P/S (significantly lower than competitors).\n* Peaked at $28.45 right after IPO.\n* CEO stated they are making progress with sales channels that are targeting CISOs (Chief information security officer) due to their holistic approach.  (Link to presentation at the bottom)\n* Option volume is overwhelmingly bullish. \n* Tiger Global Management has an excellent track record or picking winners and they own over 5 million shares, which is \\~5% of SUMO.

He has a good track record of positions, however, it seems that he has had a difficult time convincing Wallstreet. \n* SUMO has not received much press the last month. The market we are in feeds on press. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nSUMO is perfectly positioned for a run up to earnings. It is currently trading at a discount and could easily take off. Some respectable whales have taken large positions. Low public float (est. 50m shares) means that is could go up very quickly. It has strong revenue growth and has been significantly hurt by the little press that it has had. Analysts have price targets ranging from $24-31. If we see anything close to the post IPO price, this will be a big win. Any thoughts or additional DD will be appreciated!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nScenario 1: SUMO gains over the next two week to $23-25. I will sell half before earnings in scenario 1.\n\nScenario 2: SUMO continues to trade flat between $18.75-$21.00. In this case I will hold through earnings but I will buy OTM 12/18 puts to hedge my calls.\n\nScenario 3: Flat until earnings, flat after earnings. Diamond hands through earnings. Sell for 50-60% loss. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR SUMO has earnings on 12/7. It is trading at a significant discount to its peers. A little bit of good press could send this thing up to $25+ before earnings. \n\nPosition 12/18 $17.50C\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nResources:\n\nRecent presentation to RBC Capital\n\n[https://event.on24.com/eventRegistration/EventLobbyServlet?target=reg20.jsp&referrer=&eventid=2825782&sessionid=1&key=E33F6C73DCDD8D9D3ED8FDDAB8DFAAE8&regTag=&sourcepage=register](https://event.on24.com/eventRegistration/EventLobbyServlet?target=reg20.jsp&referrer=&eventid=2825782&sessionid=1&key=E33F6C73DCDD8D9D3ED8FDDAB8DFAAE8&regTag=&sourcepage=register)\n\nBarron Article \n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/sumo-logic-stock-slides-because-growth-is-slowing-51602538281?mod=mw\\_quote\\_news](https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/sumo-logic-stock-slides-because-growth-is-slowing-51602538281?mod=mw_quote_news)\n\nTiger Global Management 13F-HR Filing\n\n[https://sec.report/Document/0000919574-20-007148/](https://sec.report/Document/0000919574-20-007148/)\n\nEdit Update 11/24: sold enough of my position to break even.
