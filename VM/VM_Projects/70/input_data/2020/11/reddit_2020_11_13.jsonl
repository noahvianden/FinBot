The strike for my last covered call was $21 when the stock was sitting at 18, then this week the stock surged to 27 and then 30 before I can react and roll my calls higher.

Why?   Write it down.\n\nAfter you know that, now enter in some more details- the expiration of the previously held call, its strike price (x) and whether it was a buy or sell- and ask yourself:     \nIf I were building a spread, where the leg is at x, would i FEEL COMFORTABLE holding that spread? Would i sleep easily? Would i feel confident holding the spread? Why? Write those down.\n\nSo for example let’s use NIO friday morning. I own 100 shares at $52. I graphed it’s weekly changes each week for the last year. Let’s say it moves between $5-$10 a week rarely more than that. So... I sold a covered call for next week at $62. Got $220 in premium. Then immediately I watched as nio fucking tanked. All day. To like $43. Well... do I think by friday it will go up essentially $18? No. It dropped $10 in a day but it closed the week basically where it opened that week.\n\nSo, I opened to buy a call at $63 for the same exp as my 62 sell and I will now manage the 62/63 as if it were a credit spread. It cost me $1.33... but I have my shares back. \n\nSo $2.20 - 1.33 = .87\n\nCool. So now I sold a covered call at $55 And got a premium of $2.42. I turned $220 into $329. What can I lose? $100 in the credit spread and my 100 shares. So in my worst case if nio is a fuck and moves to $63, I walk away with... $229 + $30. \n\nI’m comfy.\nI can sleep like a baby.\n\nIf nio keeps tanking, covered calls all day baby.
