{"title": "Here is a Market Recap for today, Thursday, Nov 19, 2020. Please enjoy!", "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, November 19, 2020**\n\nThe S&P 500 (SPY) and the Dow Jones (DIA) finished modestly red for the third straight day with market participants closely monitoring rising coronavirus cases in the US and the reimposition of virus restrictions across many states. Despite the positive vaccine news coming out, it will still take some time to establish a global vaccine distribution network.\n\nUnfortunately, yesterday the United States passed the grim milestone of 250,000 deaths from coronavirus. The death toll surpasses the White House’s worst-case prediction from the Spring ([https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/03/31/trump-coronavirus-pandemic-could-kill-many-240-000-americans/5100446002/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/03/31/trump-coronavirus-pandemic-could-kill-many-240-000-americans/5100446002/)) and is predicted to keep rising with the surge of infections and hospitalizations in the last two weeks. According to Johns Hopkins University, the US is averaging a record 161,165 new infections a day in the last seven days. That’s up 27% compared to last week and by far the most since the pandemic began. Data is trending in the wrong directions, with 44 out of 50 states reporting a 10% increase in new cases compared to last week.\n\nIn response to the surge in cases, governors from both sides of the aisle have announced a variety of new restrictions. California’s governor Gavin Newsom announced that the state is “pulling the emergency brake” on reopening and reinstated broad restrictions throughout the state. In Iowa, Republican Governor Kim Reynolds, who once dismissed coronavirus restrictions as \"feel-good\" measures, has abruptly reversed course, issuing the state's first mask mandate and limiting indoor gatherings. Illinois\\*\\*,\\*\\* Michigan, and New Jersey announced additional restrictions that limit gatherings to household members. Indoor event spaces are also being ordered to shut-down or move outdoors. In Massachusetts, the governor announced a stay-at-home advisory. Mississippi, Montana, North Dakota are under state-wide mask mandate. These are just some examples, there are many more.\n\nThe Labor Department released its weekly jobs report. Another 742,000 Americans filed for first-time unemployment benefits last week, an unexpected rise compared to the 711,000 reported last week as coronavirus cases continue to surge.\n\n* 742,000 new claims vs 700,000 estimate\n* Continuing claims,  which is the number of people filing for unemployment benefits who have already filed an initial claim, was 6.4 million, equal to the estimate.\n\nDespite the positive vaccine data from Pfizer (PFE) and Moderna (MRNA), setting up an efficient, global vaccine distribution network will likely take months, even after the vaccines are approved. In the short-term, we expect the worsening pandemic and uncertainty surrounding additional fiscal stimulus will likely drive volatility in the short-term.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Another vaccine candidate frontrunner from Oxford University in partnership with AstraZeneca $AZN is expected to release data before Christmas.\n* BREXIT negotiations have been suspended because of COVID 19\n* Xperi $XPER target raise by Royal Bank of Canada from $21 to $25, stock currently around $18.50\n* Uber $UBER with two target raises.

That's why different banks and analysts come up with different conclusions, sometimes even opposites ones. I'm not sure if the banks make their models public, havent really checked. \n\nWhat's most important when looking at upgrades, IMO, is seeing what bank or brokerage made it Some top tier analysts that one should pay attention would be JPM, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, and other reputable names in the industry. For example, a price target upgrade from Morgan Stanley is more notable than one from say, Raymond James, simply because of Morgan Stanley's reputation.

{"title": "S&P Inclusion and the TSLA Hug of Death", "selftext": "Listen up kids,\n\nIf you haven't noticed, TSLA is on a moon mission, even as we speak. While this is nothing new for our favorite meme stock, this price movement has insanely strong support.\n\n**Catalyst:**\n\nTSLA Inclusion in the S&P effective 12/21.\n\n**What this means:**\n\nFunds that track the S&P, with NAV in the multiple trillion collectively, need to come up with a collective **122 Million shares of TSLA** which as of this post was the equivalent of **$60B of buying pressure** by their respective inclusion deadlines.\n\n**Why this is a big deal:**\n\nTSLA is nearly a 460B Market cap company. It isn't your typical inclusion. This is why the announcement to include them came out *5 weeks* before their inclusion date, instead of the 3-10 days we typically see.\n\nMost index funds tracking the S&P do not purchase these shares until the several days surrounding inclusion. Usually +/- 3 days on either end, so in this case 12/21 (so 12/15-12/24). This is the case in the prospectus of your boy SPY, while VFINX is deliberately vague on the topic. Just these two funds will need more than **$12B of TSLA shares** to get their AUM to reflect the new S&P accurately.\n\n~~The free float of TSLA is about **16% of all shares**. TSLA only has ~**970M shares outstanding** meaning that only **155M are being actively traded**.~~ You may recall from earlier that these funds will ultimately need about 122M. This means that the indexes ultimately need to end up with an *incredible* % of the free float in their bagholding hands by 12/21. This is going to create buying pressure the likes of which you have never seen. Traders seeking to squeeze the indices will simply buy TSLA up as high as they can, fully aware that the indexes will have to purchase from them in Dec. This will cause the stock to temporarily go *very, very, high*.\n\n**What can go wrong?**\n\n1. The S&P inclusion committee is aware that this might happen. They know it is a problem. They have said as much. They have solicited feedback from the finance community, and depending on what they hear they might decide to modify how they include TSLA, making a break from how they typically perform inclusions. They may ultimately decide to include TSLA in multiple tranches, breaking the necessity of buying for these indices into more than one wave, and taking a shot at the Dec squeeze thesis.\n\n2. The committee or major institutions may press Elon to perform another massive share issuance. This would lesson the buying pressure by dramatically increasing the float. Recall that a $5B offering would result in an increase of 10M plus shares at the moment, or an increase in the float of something 8%+, resulting in the pressure being lessened. This seems unlikely given that TSLA has tons of cash and the index has publicly snubbed TSLA once before.\n\n3. Most funds allow for wiggle room in their purchasing strategy, allowing them to hold derivative contracts in lieu of shares, or to materially differ from the index they track if an unusual situation causes shares to become unattainable or impractical. This would most likely be one of those situations. If squeezed extremely hard, most major funds would seek any and every remedy they could to avoid the window of death mentioned earlier.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBuy 12/24 expiry call contracts for TSLA, and sell them Friday 12/18, when funds get squeezed the absolute hardest. Keep eyes peeled for any of the above risks, and be prepared to adjust down your strikes or ditch. Barring these risks becoming realized we should see a bull run on TSLA that lasts nearly a full month, and I personally imagine it could crack $600 before a steep retreat.\n\nEdit: Positions 3x 12/24 600c, 1x 11/27 480c, 50 shares\n\nEdit2: Revised the market cap to the correct market cap as of that date, and please disregard the free float comment, the opposite is true, only about 20-22% are **not** included in the free float.", "id": "jx4hl6", "created_utc": 1605798999.0, "score": 158, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 74, "comments": [{"body": "this is a great post. #2 should worry everyone however, im sure Elon will have no problem sticking it to the S&P for not including it the first time around", "score": 69, "replies": [{"body": "The 2 most recent times Tesla issued more shares, their stock actually went up for the few days following the announcement since this strengthened Tesla's chances of having enough cash to survive for longer and gives them more money to spend on Terafactories.", "score": 19, "replies": [{"body": "when were the previous times they offered shares?", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "I remember back on February 13th they did, and it went up for the next week.
