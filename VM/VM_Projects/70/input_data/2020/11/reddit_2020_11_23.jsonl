{"title": "4 month UPDATE: My first 30 days of theta focused trading", "selftext": "About 2.5 months ago I posted the results of my first 30 days of theta \"based\" trading.

Put Credit Spreads aren't nearly as much of a theta play as they are capitalizing on vega. I still maintain they are a good way for small accounts to rely on selling premium, but there is just so much premium lost by buying back the long put.\n2. Commission is high. I knew this going into the post but it was the top rated comment.\n3. I had a lost of positions to manage. This was fine at the beginning, but is more difficult once life starts to get in the way...\n\n**Changes I have made since that post:**\n\n1. I hardly sell any put credit spreads anymore. With the ups and downs of this market, I do not like carrying positions where I can lose the entire position; even if it is small I had too much invested in positions where I lose the entire $. Spreads are also more difficult to roll.\n2. I now only sell puts and dabble in stocks.\n\n**Results:**\n\n1. Including the results from my last post, I have a earned a 43% return since my first trading day on August 3rd. The below screenshots show various statistics.\n2. After my first 30 days, commission accounted for 10.77% of my total profit. Now that I am making a lower quantity of trades with higher dollar value, commission accounts for 3.7% of my total profit. This is still somewhat inflated from a high quantity of put credit spreads back in September, but is continually decreasing. My commission accounts for less than 1% of trades in November.\n\n**Going Forward:**Please comment with any questions and I will answer every one fully.
