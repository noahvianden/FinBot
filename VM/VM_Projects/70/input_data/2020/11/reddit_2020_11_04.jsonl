Overall the trend has been bullish the last 8 months (since march) and the trends historically continue after an election.  I do agree that the buying we saw today was a little more than expected, but the markets are happy just to have a little more clarity.\n\nAs more data is coming in it seems that Biden may actually have clinched the win.  We still have a lot more votes to count, but things are starting to lean Dem.  With that said it looks like the republicans are going to keep senate which means the Dem's wont be able pass some of their bigger tax plans. \n\nI am a little hesitant to buy here as there are still so many unknowns.  \n\nOn a technical level 320 on SPY has been a huge area of support.  It looks like last Thursday / Friday were just another test of this support.  If you look back the last 8 months each time 320 has been tested it has lead to a big bounce or break down.
