{"title": "$QS DD—Get your short shorts boys.", "selftext": "The tendie train of the day is QuantomScape ($**QS**)... \n\n# The following is my take on why I think $QS is grossly overvalued and this speculation spike we've had in the last week is destined to fall just as hard as it mooned.\n\n*If you pull up a chart, you'll see that $QS had a massive (speculation) run in the last week after their SPAC deal with Kensington Capital.* \n\n**Who is QuantomScape/what do they do?**\n\nThey are an EV Battery company—they have a super innovative battery that sets them apart from the Lithium-ion world, with their **Solid-State Lithium-Metal technology**. You can watch a product video [here](https://vimeo.com/466298136).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Superior Energy Density](https://preview.redd.it/1x589ko1le261.png?width=2568&format=png&auto=webp&s=8184283e70cc169d423e6c33de420f7ce800128d)\n\n[Much more compact.](https://preview.redd.it/1422l9gdle261.png?width=2574&format=png&auto=webp&s=881bad3272e3b8da310a2d45b380125cbdcc1d50)\n\n[Even cheaper than Li-Ion.](https://preview.redd.it/dwklqfirle261.png?width=2564&format=png&auto=webp&s=e01445e55d6b155e5ab810e094b068d45a319d73)\n\n[Here's a direct comparison of the two.](https://preview.redd.it/5ida58sime261.png?width=2546&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d5011f745fbc8f47f532d04780a2827b3693c56)\n\nTo sum it up, their technology is nothing to scoff at... their batteries have a higher energy density, provide more range, more compact than lithium-ion batteries, they're cheaper, etc. **They're better than the industry-leading Li-Ion batteries across the board.**\n\nAlso worth noting, QuantomScape is backed by JB Straubel (Tesla's Cofounder), and if you know Tesla's history, you know how substantial the backing by the likes of him is...\n\n**The Financials:**\n\nBefore I dive into this, it's worth noting that their TAM is $450B, and their current MCAP is less than $1B... That number is derived from the fact that 90M cars are produced a year, multiplied by the price of their battery.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Sales Commitments](https://preview.redd.it/hpezchv1se261.png?width=2554&format=png&auto=webp&s=e55abb0aaea6a2f6cd6a4b57d31fc62cf455a072)\n\nAs you can see, they are partnered with Volkswagen, so their **estimated revenues are just about as guaranteed as an estimate gets**. Volkswagen plans to launch \\~70 EV models, and produce 22M EV's by 2029 in which will be powered by QuantomScape. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[REV Estimates](https://preview.redd.it/eg1q9rblse261.png?width=2554&format=png&auto=webp&s=031d1ed6ac2900ab5ec78299b2c0c7f5784ed79c)\n\nHere are their estimated revenues, and here lies the major problem for me... \n\n **!! THEY DON'T HAVE ANY REVENUES UNTIL 2024 YET THEY'RE SELLING AT 72X EV/REVS !!**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vvak1cr7ve261.png?width=2094&format=png&auto=webp&s=f372dfc22c81654f60df838e0802c3f295f80235\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hlc1l3g9ve261.png?width=1534&format=png&auto=webp&s=faa3ab5f5572f93293faf627945b00efe9942b39\n\nIf this price isn't pure speculation, then idk what is... It's reminding me of $NKLA at $70. They haven't even proved they have the manufacturing capabilities to meet any of their sales targets:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Roadmap](https://preview.redd.it/5cclczznue261.png?width=2558&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f88e5f47c6698685d4702452afe1f4adca904f1)\n\nEven if we lower the share price to $20, from the current trading price of $44 that would still be a 32x EV/REVS premium on projected revenues that are 4 years from now lol. \n\n**TLDR:**\n\n\\- Despite QuantomScape's incredible technology, the green grass is way too far out (4 years) to justify a 72x EV/REVS valuation. The current price is completed inflated by speculation.\n\n\\- QuantomScape hasn't even proved they can meet the manufacturing demands of their committed sales 4 years from now.\n\nI think $QS is poised to be an incredible long-term investment considering its tech is unmatched, its TAM is enormous, and the entire EV space is growing like a wildfire; but simply not at this absurd valuation. I'm planning on riding my puts down to a reasonable valuation, then either buying leaps, or shares.\n\n**Positions:**\n\n$QS $17.5P 12/18  &  $12.5P 12/18\n\n\\*This is not investment advice, I'm not a financial expert, this is my own opinion.\\*\n\n\n*****UPDATE*****\n\nTo everyone asking, I sold them after the 30% decline on December 1st—I got lucky.  \n\nIf you held on the way up, congrats; solid gain! My timing was way off. \n\nShits about to come down though; there’s no way there’s enough speculation to keep this price/valuation (107x as I’m writing this) afloat between now and 2024 when QS sees its first dollar in revenue...\n\nAlso, check this out:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/9QFgPHzQolU", "id": "k40pep", "created_utc": 1606758010.0, "score": 13, "upvote_ratio": 0.74, "num_comments": 74, "comments": [{"body": "I think your timing is off a bit.
