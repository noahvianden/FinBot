These are call options and trade like any other commodity. Yes they are a derivative of the underlying stock but you can trade derivatives without touching the underlying.\n\nSo, your choices are:\n\n1) Sell now for a loss of $525.

When you \"Buy\" options you pay money to your broker for the contracts.  You have the right but NOT the obligation to purchase 100 shares of the stock at the strike price for the duration of the contract.  For that right you paid some money, we call this \"premium\".  In the case of a call if the stock goes up the value of the contract goes up and you make money.  Best way to handle that scenario is to sell those contracts back to the market before the expiration date.  If the stock goes nowhere the contracts will slowly lose value.  This is called \"theta decay\" (it happens regardless of where the stock goes but is most visible when the stock is not moving).  If the stock goes down the value of the contract goes down. If you are looking to exit your position and this is where you are probably better to just sell the options back to the market and get some of your premium back than to let them expire worthless (that would be your maximum loss scenario).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen you \"Sell\" options you take in money and someone out there now owns contracts that you are obligated to.  If you \"sell\" a call option you are now obligated to sell 100 shares of that stock, to whomever you sold the contract to, for the strike price.  For that obligation you take in that premium.  If the stock price drops then the value of the call option goes down and it would cost you less to \"buy\" it back from the market. Thus you would have made a profit, or you could let it expire worthless and you keep all your premium you took in but it's generally better to close the position once you have made a good chunk of your profit. If the stock goes nowhere the value of the option decays but this time it is in your favor.  If the stock goes up and your option you sold gains in value you would have to pay more to buy it back than you received in premium.  \n\n\"Naked\" refers to when you \"sell\" an option and do not already own the underlying shares.  This is the opposite of \"covered\".  For a \"naked call\" you have sold a call option and you don't own the shares so if they exercise their option you would be obligated to buy 100 shares of the stock at whatever the current market price is.  This is theoretically an unbounded risk.  The stock could go to the moon and you would be on the hook for a lot of money.  For a \"naked put\" you are obligated to buy 100 shares of the stock at the strike price.  This has a much more defined risk.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGenerally your broker will not let you take on a \"naked call\" position unless you are cleared for it.  Not sure what you're specifics are but here's what I think happened.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. You have no clue what you are doing or what the terms mean.\n2. You bought call options and are afraid of when expiration hits being that you don't have the funds to buy the shares when/if the options are automatically exercised by your broker.\n3. You read somewhere about Naked Calls and the riskiness of them and started to panic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's what you need to do.  Figure out did you buy options or sell them.  If you really can't tell, call your broker and let them help you with this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you bought options then you probably should close the position.  I don't get the feeling you are in a position to time the market to optimize your exit.  Without knowing the specifics of what you bought and when we can't help you there.  So if you bought them then \"sell to close\".\n\nIf you sold options and are now obligated in an actual \"naked call\" position then you probably want to get out of that too.
