{"title": "What Palantir Does (Retard Friendly)", "selftext": "Too many retards are investing in this company without knowing what tremendous value Palantir has. In this post, I will be going over Palantir’s Gotham. I can make subsequent posts about the other tools Palantir provides if this proves useful. Retardation causes paper hands, I hope this helps bring some clarity to you retards. \n\nGotham-\nTransforms data to be user friendly. Software engineers and database developers know how to interpret and query the data in the corporation’s database. However, retards like you and business people need an easier way of understanding the mass amounts of data(pretty pictures). For example a company like Moderna or Pfizer could utilize it to find out the fine details and make connections about the vaccines they’re distributing. Gotham would provide pretty diagrams and charts to interpret how many people in certain age groups take the vaccine and the amount of side effects they may experience. Additionally the data from Moderna and Pfizer are separate. Since this is a pandemic, we may want them to collaborate and combine both their data. Gotham is the only easy tool out there that would allow these 2 corporations to do that seamlessly. These features are extremely attractive towards business people and corporations. It will essentially take away the need for business people having to ask the weaboo antisocial software engineers what the fuck they’re showing on their cum stained monitors.\n🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀", "id": "k2pm0q", "created_utc": 1606577712.0, "score": 249, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 74, "comments": [{"body": "I think everyone low key thinks pltr dabbles in world domination.", "score": 177, "replies": [{"body": "the name of the company alone sounds like it could be household... apple, microsoft, google, palantir, tesla 🤑🤑🤑🚀🤑🤑", "score": 61, "replies": [{"body": "Tezlaaaaa 🥺🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑😎😎😎🤑😎🤑👊🏾👨🏿‍🦰🍻", "score": 12, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Palantir \n\nPalantine \n\nPalpantine\n\nPalpatine \n\nEmperor Palpatine", "score": 81, "replies": [{"body": "^ Real dd right here guys", "score": 18, "replies": []}, {"body": "You guys do know the company is named after the seeing stones of numenor that sauron used to corrupt saruman and denethor, right?

That should be clear.\n\nWhat they are special for, is something called FedRamp. This is a security clearance and process for putting data in government employees hands. As well as using federally secure data to accomplish what you outlined. The trick here is that in order for a company to achieve fed ramp status. They need government sponsors. Seeing as Palantir is already there and has beat most of their potential competitors on that one piece. This makes is very likely for them to win more and more government business. Because when contracting with the Gov. you need past experience that is outlined in RFP Responses to win more business. This all adds up to a near monopoly on all things government and data analytics. So while palantir is sucking on the tit of the taxpayer.

Yes Palantir could compete in the consumer space with their tech and they likely will. Getting on to something like a program of record though is a huge defensive moat - they take at least 5 years of contract winning and lobbying and then they secure 5-20 years of $1b's of spending on products/services that get set aside in future budgets. Getting them is difficult but once you're on one your revenue becomes as secure as treasury bonds. Also being on a program of record makes it easier to get on more and they can now partner with other companies that want exposure to the DoD but can't get through FedRAMP and PoR. The DoD will not spend significant amounts of money on private sector companies unless they go through this process. Look at how much Elon complains about what SpaceX had to go through and that's just for NASA. It's a terrible system and it's why you see so few DoD startups but it makes the winners filthy rich.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCombine all that with a software business with typical high margins \\[\\~80%\\] (unlike all the traditional hardware defense contractors) and I'm not sure if you can come up with a better business to make more money.", "score": 7, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "You argue their competitors do the work MUCH better.

The only scary part stock wise from palantir is that one year you could have 2B in gov contracts, while the next year maybe it’s a slow year for the gov and they only see 200M. They are at the mercy of the taxpayer and federal dollars. So that’s a big sketchy.
