{"title": "Selling Covered Calls on SPY seems like a bad deal?", "selftext": "I am a buy and hold loser who is thinking about selling covered calls on my stocks to wsb degenerates for easy money. However, after looking into it, it doesn't seem that the premiums being offered are worth my personal risk tolerance in the event the stock would rise beyond the strike price.\n\nI was hoping you guys could let me know if my analysis is correct and that selling covered calls is actually quite risky, or perhaps if I am making some mistake and there are other ways of going about it.\n\nMy idea here is that you are actually a buy and hold investor but do not think the SPY will increase by a huge amount in a short time frame, and can profit from wsb people who do. I'm not looking to buying a random stock and turning around and selling covered calls; rather I'm looking to sell covered calls on broad basket ETFs/funds like SPY that I already own and want to continue to own for the long term.\n\n----\n\nSPY is currently 326.54. Lets say you happened to own 100 shares in SPY/$32,654 worth of SPY, and wanted to sell an OTM covered call on your shares with an expiration date of about three weeks from now on November 20.\n\nA strike price of 375 is about 15% more than the current price. The ask for calls three weeks from now is 0.14 or $14.00 premium. IMO, a 15% increase is large and I'm doubtful it could happen in three weeks. But $14 premium isn't even worth the time to place the sell order. However, If I did this 17 times per year, I'de net $238. While I get much less than this from my credit card rewards program every year, it would still be nice I guess to have $238 extra.\n\nA strike price of  360 is 10% more than the current price. The ask is 0.48 or $48 premium. While I think the stock probably will not rise beyond 10%, I think it might, and $48 of premium isn't worth it. Say the stock moves 11% or to 362.46. If I didn't sell the covered call I would have $198 more ((362.46 - 360) * 100 - $48). Say I sell 17 of these per year for $816 in premiums. I would only have to be wrong 3 times per year before the losses exceed the premiums. And that assumes the stock only moves 11% and not more.\n\nA strike price of 343 is 5% more than current price. The ask is 3.49 or $349 premium. This is starting to look like real money, however I'm not confident than the stock won't increase by 5% during that time. If the stock moved 10% to 360, I would lose out on $1351, compared to having not sold the covered call ((360 - 343) * 100 - $349). If I sold 17 of these per year for $5933 in premiums, I again would have to be wrong about 3 times per year for the losses to exceed the premiums.\n\nNone of these seem like that great of deals to me. I was kind of expecting that demand from wsb degenerates in search of FDs would be huge and that I could sell relatively low risk covered calls for large premiums. Of course, if this were true, then everyone would be selling covered calls and would drive the premium price down.\n\nAm I even doing the analysis correctly?
