Care to divulge any advice right now?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Sure absolutely. \n\nSometimes stocks take a beating and to put it simply it is what it is.  If you do your DD/due diligence you shouldn’t be scared of doing a play even if you’re down 30% it shouldn’t even make you shudder unless some unknown event happens without prior knowledge. \n\nA good example of this is SMRT.  Stein Mart is a retail company I little more than doubled my money off of  my first year trading. I went back to buying again right after their q3 (the quarter before christmas) conference call. I bought at 90 cents and within a month it fell to 65ish cents. \n\nI DID NOT get scared or shudder.  I did my due diligence. Steinmart had 150 million in debt. Important to note this debt only happened because of a ridiculous dividend that was taken years back but I digress.  The money each year was getting paid down by about 20 million.  SteinMart had 44 million shares outstanding. Also, without this debt being paid down the company would be making small profits each year or breaking even.\n\nThey essentially were breaking even or having small losses each year but their business wasn’t in jeopardy after changes sighted in the next paragraph. \n\nThey changed up their stores and got rid of a lot of crap inventory, and wasted space when I first made money on them. They continued to do that to the time I’m talking of now. So essentially the company cut A TON of cost and made it so they were basically breaking even. They also changed the website and made it more customer friendly. \n\nSo the time I bought at 90 cents and it dropped they did the following :\n\nThen they updated the system so you can order stuff from other stores and do in store pick up. Next they added a brand new jewelry section, and a kids section with Disney brands. All these things made big reasons to buy. In 50 of 250 stores they added new jewelry sections. If you have 1000 profit average each day IN THE CHRISTMAS season mind you, you then get 4.5 million for the 50 stores. After that you think they added a bigger kids section with Disney brands that’s definitely worth something.  \n\nThat’s not the kicker though. Here’s the real kicker they had 150 million in debt that was steadily getting paid down. Do you know how much money they had in inventories worth of their clothes? 309 million.  So now if you just do the following 309-150 million=159 million. The market cap at 90 cents was 39 million. That’s a lot of meat on the bone. 159 million/44 million outstanding shares = 3.50$ ish. Now let’s say it’s a buyout and we are generous. 2$ is double and then some of what I paid. So a company would pay 88 million for 70 million in inventories. Oh yeah and one more thing all of this companies leases were coming up so stores that costed a lot could be either Moved, renegotiated, or closed down. \n\nSadly they got bought out at 90 cents the exact price I paid for them and have a ton legal action taken place for not supporting the share price from angry investors cause in the buyout the founder is getting to keep his 33% stake of the shares. Smh. This all being said let this be a lesson to you, you don’t need the trendiest stock. If there is clear no bullshit and tons of value go for it.  And if you can literally do enough DD like I did to the point where I’m not the least bit worried do that. That’s how you win in stocks in general especially penny stocks. People always go for the hype stock win once or twice then get caught with their pants down.  You don’t need a hype stock.

{"title": "The case for SPY 157", "selftext": "In my last post here I showed you guys one of the ways you can effectively yolo.   \n [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/djhobg/how\\_to\\_efficiently\\_yolo\\_retarded\\_nonretarded/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/djhobg/how_to_efficiently_yolo_retarded_nonretarded/) \n\nIn this post, I will make the bearish case for SPY 157. There are two big reasons why SPY might go back down to 157, So lets get started.\n\n1. Both the recessions that took place in 2000 (dot com) and 2008 (housing) crisis have something in common. They both started to decline after hitting 157.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[A graph showing SPY from 1999 to 2015. Notice that in both recessions market hit 157.](https://preview.redd.it/x4fszvffj2l41.png?width=1426&format=png&auto=webp&s=5776be601168dc40d879f067da104110220b7639)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Another chart of SPY showing a more zoomed out view. Red = Monthly Chart TA, Blue = Weekly Chart TA, White = Daily Chart TA](https://preview.redd.it/prj9dkg2k2l41.png?width=1458&format=png&auto=webp&s=07a0b95f694419e691c9bd7703ec6c477bb63417)\n\n2. In both the 2000 and 2008 recessions, the market declined by approximately 50% and 54% respectively from its peak. Well, guess what is 50%-54% of the current high? Yes, its the region around 157\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Monthly Chart showing SPY, and how the 50-54&#37; moves line up with 157 area](https://preview.redd.it/4lrv005cm2l41.png?width=1163&format=png&auto=webp&s=4869aee346b3a7b39c2a5f077724a48cda30fa5d)\n\nNow, how likely is this situation? Nothing is confirmed until SPY makes a close below this 11 year trend line its been following.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Overall look of Monthly SPY chart.](https://preview.redd.it/i85f1fyon2l41.png?width=1397&format=png&auto=webp&s=68f569274dd3b47bf6e5ef0469e3089ca4f9020b)\n\nAt the time of writing, this would be if SPY CLOSES below 270 this month.\n\nI'm not claiming this will happen, just trying to show you what a recession could look like.

I include myself in this; however, these are the  assumptions I'm running with and agree with you concerning the 1,570 strike price.\n\nHere below is my reasoning... which is heavily tied to Corona, but I'm well into agreeing that you're correct.\n\n1. 50+  demographic will have at least a 40% infection rate and 2% fatality for  the first round of Corona.  Subsequent rounds later in 2020 and early  2021 will reduce both numbers by 90% but not be forgotten in corporate  planning regarding productivity decreases.\n2. Fear  of dying by boomers will liquidate many of their positions in May /  June.  I've calculated out a peak death table for the US and other  countries once they've posted at least 5 statistically significant death  days.  This gives a run rate for fatalities and then using total  mortality against the growth rate for deaths you can find the inflection  point for when things get better.\n3. Bereavement  productivity issues will be astoundingly impactful from April - June.   Not included in my models but it helps me to hedge that things will get  much worse.\n4. The  peaks to the 2001 recession and 2008 recession were around 1,500 before  dropping to 800 and 700 respectively.  It seems reasonable given  business growth that 1,500 is a safe floor for the S&P500 given it  was the ceiling for the last two recessions.  \\*(Pitch random logic  spitball at me here.)\n5. Supply  chains will have to become more geographically diverse to avoid  material and product lock downs.  India keeping pharmaceuticals in  country is likely to drive this change in corporate behavior and require  regional product manufacturing.\n6. Sick  days will again in the US be utilized and respected.  This change will  have a minor but critical alteration in the total productivity numbers  as it will not be acceptable to show up to work with a minor cough or  fever for the foreseeable future.  This also holds true for employees  watching their children.\n7. In  the US we are going to have massive layoffs due to decreased demand.   Probably not 2008 levels of layoffs, but that's because there will be a  bit of offset from those dying from Corona.", "score": 4, "replies": []}, {"body": "Need more colors on the chart", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "what is this fortune cookie shit", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "I came to the same and dow around 18000 at the least.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "By may or June", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "At this rate it could be next Friday lol.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "If we get a crash, yes.
