If left untouched and thus exercised, they'd be obligated to buy Tesla at it's MP and sell the 270,000 shares at the strike of $490.   So, a $6.5772M loss to end the pain.\n\nInstead they rolled it, a very common, and reasonable move, meaning they bought the 270k calls to close and simultaneously sold 270k calls with a 4/17 expiry and $500 strike.  I'll have to check the option chain and edit for a rough idea, but the point is that had he simply bought to close, he'd be out the $6.5M.  Since the 4/17 C500's are worth a bunch, he either reduced his cost or even possibly made some money, and now has to hope TSLA doesn't shoot way up by April 17.  It could - and then the potential loss would be HUUUGE.\n\nEdit: So a 4/17 C500 at close was going for $61.65 (last trade).  \n\nIt's hard to say exactly what he paid to buy to close - early in the day it's possible it was worth only a little more than it's intrinsic of $10, but at that volume he's paying extra anyway.  Probably noonish was the lowest opportunity in retrospect, since it went below $500 - meaning the $490 calls were at risk of expiring worthless.  This would have a mathematical effect on value, and cause some people holding speculative calls to rush to sell, sending supply up and decreasing value (in the simplest supply/demand terms).  Of course, he could have held on, hoping it'd get below $490 or at least closer to it - that decision making is where the real skill is at in options IMO.\n\nLet's say he held, deciding that by 1-2 pm he'd sell if it was lingering lower.  At 12:30 it spiked to $505 - this may have caused the roll.  If he held further because it started slipping again, the bump at 1:30ish from around $504.50 to $515 definitely would have made him nope out.  With 2:30h left in the day and a sharp climb, it easily was a $25-35 premium or more then, I don't have that historical data.  Let's assume he either sold around $25 or waited til 3:55, the result is similar.  We already know that was $6.577M worth.   He rolled to an in the money call with about 21 days to expiration - a risky move - but he did get $61.65 x 100 x 2,700 - $16.6455M minus the $6.577M, so about a $11M credit.  Due to size, these weren't electronic orders and the price was likely more, but that'd be on both trades I think, so the credit would be similar.\n\nSounds like a nice save, right? $11M in the pocket rather than $6.5 out (Though, the premium initially received could have been more, meaning just losing 6.5 could potentially be a net win - depends when he sold the C490s).  Except, these are very uncertain times, and TSLA is about as volatile as stocks get, especially over $1-200.  21 days ago TSLA was at ~$617, which would make the loss / buy to close order $117 per share - so 270k x 117 = $31.59M if it was $617 on 4/17.\n\nOf course, he'll probably look for a downturn to just buy to close, potentially at an overall win.  If TSLA drops to 450 on, say, April 5th, he can close for probably a few million.\n\nHigh stakes fuckery, basically.

Instead they bought 2700 Calls expiring yesterday (thus cancelling out their sell) and sold 2700 $500Cs exp 4/17.\n\nIf I'm understanding it right I assume they took a hit having to buy the calls back yesterday when Tesla's price had shot up.
