People still need shit, companies are going to have to make products and provide services. There may be a supply shock in the short term and one analog to look at would be the oil crisis of the early 70s. There was a fierce bear market that dropped the market almost 50% in a year. Stonks are going to do fuck all this year if we start seeing economic effects. \n\nBut I think one possible outcome of this panic that's getting overlooked here is triggering inflation. What's going to happen when products start to become scarce and people need to outbid others for more of them? You guessed it. Yet the 10 year yield hit a record low. I think the coming rout in bond prices will be the next big shoe to drop if we start seeing actual supply shocks. I might wait until we get any announcement from central banks on rate cuts. That should be the final nail in the coffin and should cement an upward price (inflation) spiral. \n\nThis isn't necessarily about the short term supply shock which would sort itself out in a few months, but about central banks overreacting and getting on the wrong side of inflation.

For context, the lowest it's ever been was 37.8, and that was during november of 2008. Moreover, the only thing that china is consistently good at is lying about official numbers, so that numbers in reality are most likely closer to 25-30.\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-february-manufacturing-pmi-drops-162233535.html  \n\n\nFurthermore, analysts were anticipating that number to be somewhere around 47, but clearly the yoga they have been practicing since new years has gotten them flexible enough to get their heads far enough up their asses to think that quarantining 700 million people in the largest manufacturing country on planet earth would only drop the index by 6-7 points - ie the true consequences of this supply chain disruption hasn't been priced in yet.¬†\n\nWhat's the play? any retail that heavily relies on chinese imports. For example, WMT will most likely see the largest hit, as their logistics structures are centered around lean invetory management - meaning that they forecast and order from their vendors every week to keep inventory levels low so they don't waste money on storage and moving unnecessary products. Even if they order enough in large volumes now to get them through the next few months, it will be may-June that they start seeing major disruptions in their product lines because there's nothing coming behind it. And for a retailer that lives on 2-3% margin, they're going to get absolutely ass blasted.¬†\n\nIf WSB wants to really vandalize the markets, start compiling lists of retailers and manufactures that rely on chinese goods - and start looking at puts with expirations of June-July.¬†", "id": "fc1c74", "created_utc": 1583099562.0, "score": 134, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 72, "comments": [{"body": "Find companies that are dependent on Chinese supply chains that are smaller than WMT.
