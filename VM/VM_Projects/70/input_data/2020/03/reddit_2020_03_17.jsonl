I would speculate that EV development wont be hampered much, but a pullback in spending on autonomous systems might happen. The only reason I would guess that, is due to the recent dampening of enthusiasm for fully autonomous systems being completed in the near term that appears to be happening.  \n\nIn my experience the way this plays out is that the vehicle programs going forward will be forced to have lower cost targets.  So the chief engineer will have to make tradeoffs on what tech he wants to pay for.

{"title": "Rite Aid (RAD) Mooning After Earnings 4/09", "selftext": "All right listen up autists. u/Howard_510 made a damn good DD about a month ago about RAD. Read it.\n\n[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6k5ot/rad_is_the_next_spce/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\n\nNow for the update. Yesterday was Analyst Day, and you guessed it, RAD fucking mooned. Last week, it was down over 40%. Not good right? Well yesterday, it shot up 75%. Yeah, this is better than SPCE, TSLA, GILD, or whatever autistic SPY puts you all are buying. You have the chance to get in before earnings (4/9) with 4/17 calls and make fucking bank. \n\nFor the people who’ve read this far: it’s obvious why RAD dropped so much last week. The markets in the shitter, and we’re in a recession. Soon enough, we aren’t gonna be seeing the crazy volatility and the profitability of calls and puts alike. What does that mean? It means we need to find good, undervalued stocks, and make them the new meme stocks. Fuck the biotech companies who all have the new coronavirus cure, they’re dogshit. RAD is it. In case you didn’t read the original post, they reported earnings in mid December. They beat expectations by 270%, and their stock price shot up from $7.50 to $20 in two weeks. That’s 165%. Free tendies. Can’t go tits up.\n\n[Analyst Day Report](https://www.riteaid.com/corporate/news/-/pressreleases/news-room/2020/rite-aid-to-outline-corporate-strategy-and-growth-plan-at-analyst-day)\n\nKey takeaway:\nRAD raised their guidance. Not by a ton, but think about it. A terrible quarter for the economy, and they increase their earnings expectations. Not by a ton, but why would they raise their guidance only to just barely meet it by their earnings call? They know they’re gonna knock it out of the fucking park again and yesterday was just a little taste. \n\n**Tl;dr - If you like money, load up on any RAD 4/17 calls.**\n\nPositions: I’m a broke boy until RAD moons. Only have 1 contract of RAD 15c 4/17 and 1 RAD 12c 4/17.\n\nDear SEC,\nI’m not qualified to give financial advice and therefore I would never give financial advice. This is gambling advice, just with really good odds\n\nEdit: Sorry fellows, hope you sold before earnings.

{"title": "Watch out for Too Big to Fail!", "selftext": "This was my comment on another post but I’m expanding on it. \n\nIm an Autist in training who lived through 2008 Crisis whoring around wall st types.\n\nGoing forward apply the rule of too big to fail to not get sodomized by the government bailouts that will be raining down on us like Tesla put tendies over the next couple of weeks. \n\nRemember like banks and car companies in 2008 - rules don’t apply to everyone\n\nI peaced out from my Boeing puts and AAL puts the minute I realized they won't be allowed to fail... this is my strategy going forward - if it's too big to fail or vital to our infrastructure it will get bailed out - airlines, major hotels, aircraft manufactures, banks (duh), oil, farms, whatever.... if we could live without it they will let it fail - Cheesecake Factory, Outback, Yum, DRI...  I personally think a lot of these mediocre restaurant groups are getting what's long over due cause they serve shitty overpriced food. \nI’m sure there are other vulnerable industries that don’t have the prestige needed to be bailout worthy but I’m too fat and dumb to think of them. \n\n[gains and positions](https://imgur.com/a/6dkZBXu)\n\nSPY Puts \n1- 216p 3/23 \n2- 230p 3/31\n1- 240p 3/31\n\nYum \n2x $65p 3/27 avg cost$3 \n2x $65p 4/17 avg cost$5\n\nBLMN \n4x $7.50p 4/17 avg cost $1.30\n\nDRI \n4x $35p 4/17 avg cost $3.60\n\nKroger Calls \nSLV calls \n\nTLDR: some companies will be too big to fail and too important to realize the losses they deserve.\n\nEdit: for those who want to see all time...
