The total amount of deaths reaching almost 2.6M(!) by Aug. This is a very grim and devastating outcome, by any standards.

The total amount of deaths would have “only” been around 37K by Sep. I don’t believe this is scenario is possible anymore.\n\nUnfortunately, the amount of deaths will keep increasing for a while, even after the infectious curve is flatten due to inertia.

Inner cities already don’t have the best access to grocery stores, so having a plan in place that says “here is how we’re going to make sure all of you have food and water” would go a long way in tamping down some of the fear that those residents have got to be feeling right now.
