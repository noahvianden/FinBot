{"title": "How Trump may be staving off liquidity issues in banks - TLDR: 26 March is impt.", "selftext": "Everyone's heard the news on Trump trying to delay the unemployment numbers. Sure, he may just be buying time in general. But what is interesting to me is the date where he's aiming to delay it.\n\n [https://edition.cnn.com/2020/03/20/politics/labor-department-states-unemployment-numbers-coronavirus/index.html](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/03/20/politics/labor-department-states-unemployment-numbers-coronavirus/index.html) \n\nCNN report Labor Department is asking states to delay it till next Thursday. What's special about next Thursday huh? Thursday, March 26th is the day the feds reduce reserve requirement ratios for depository institutions to 0%. This requirement applies to foreign banks operating in the US as well. \n\n [https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200315b.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200315b.htm) \n\nMy hunch is that Trump is playing around the scenario where mass panic causes bank drawdowns that exacerbates panic if the banks hit their reserve ratios. \n\nTLDR: 26 March is key. Trade carefully around the 25th and 26th March and close off any positions you're not confident in. You can blow your load after the 26th March if your balls aren't alr blue.\n\nEDIT: For retard level clarity, what I want to say is:  unemployment numbers are something every man on the street understands. When unemployment numbers are up, average smaller corps and businesses will suffer from reduced consumer spending. Small companies will need more money to keep their businesses afloat and if small banks keep loaning money out to them, they'll hit the reserve ratio before the 26th themselves. That will hit the news that no companies can borrow from XX bank any more and cause consumer banking clients to panic and make bank runs on small banks.\n\nIf we survive till the 26th, the 0% reserve requirement kicks in. Banks have at least 10% more leeway for loaning to businesses, and no one panics. Barring other news, 26th might be a big green day. \n\n**Tldr: Don't keep any SPY puts expiring on 26th or 27th March. The SPY upside risk is too high. This is not to say you should not hold SPY puts going into 26 and 27 March. Roll them further out.** You'll still print tendies in SPY Apr puts as long as situation deteriorates. No need to play the ones expiring on 26th.\n\nEdit: 26/3 Hope no one got too badly fucked over by expiring puts this week. Even my own longer dated puts has my balls shrivelled. \n\nThe administration has obviously demonstrated they are willing to prop this farce all the way till the end of the pandemic. We'll need bigger cracks in the system before we'll know when the sell-off begins.
