However I think that could be made up for in scale, if you're making 5 different models at 200k units each you might be better off making a modular power train and busting out a million of them, you might get the processes sufficiently efficient to make it better. \n\nI liked what they said about recycling and charging too.

And they're simply reacting to market trends with nothing innovative here. They (along with LG Chem) certainly have engineering talent- after all, their energy density figures and $$$/kWh looks better than most other traditional carmakers. However, their management is clueless, and I cringed several times during that presentation due to their questionable marketing. If I were a GM investor, I'd be looking for an exit.\n\nWorth noting that their vehicle spec targets in the next few years (batteries up to 200 kWh, 200 kW charging capability, 3 sec 0-60, 400 mi range) is at or below where Tesla's cars are *today*, not cars in 2023.
