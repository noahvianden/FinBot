Again, I'll reiterate this point. You don't understand what that initial price drop meant for \"how ugly it is\". To you, it just happened. For someone who can understand the model used, it meant a catastrophic.\n\nThe first thing I encourage you to do, understand exactly what a 30% drop in spy means. What does that say about all future cash flows expected to be accrued to the investor?\n\nTo put it simply, a 30%+ drop was signifying something even WORSE than what actually occurred. I don't know how else I can explain that in simple terminology without you actually doing a discounted cash flow model yourself or at least doing a price multiple in reverse. You're not quantifying the lost cash flows at all. So you're ending up at values that will never be derived at by any market maker.\n\nYou need to justify why you expect all future earnings will drop by 30-50% to justify your price target, or why the whole market will settle on p/e less than 15, when treasuries yield even less than they used to.\n\nI'd say also, if you can't understand why a company like Tesla(or any high growth company in which future prospects are good but this years cash flows are shot) would actually have a smaller drop than a mature company, then this isn't intuitive to you. You should intuitively know that the loss of this year's cash flows of a high growth company is far less detrimental to a company than a company who has low growth, and loses 1 year of cash flows because more of the valuation of a high growth company is in future cash flows, vs a low growth company stores more of its current valuation on current cash flows.\n\nEdit: also, why would I take the time to explain this? From my point of view, I know retail investors make this mistake regularly. It's well documented. But if I also can't explain it to a retail investor no matter how hard I try, it means there is volume and spread writing opportunities in areas I wouldn't expect there to be, because I'm not thinking like a retail client.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": ">To put it simply, a 30%+ drop was signifying something even WORSE than what actually occurred.\n\nYes, I agree what has already happened does not warrant a 30% drop. However, I do believe that what is still likely to happen (as things get worse) warrants a further drop than what we have already experienced. I personally believe that drop was a mix of overvaluation that has been partially corrected and some loss in the true valuation of a company. \n\nI understand your comment about younger, high-growth companies versus legacy companies. Yes, the cost to access to capital is as close to 0 as we can get and this is available to (I assume) all companies we are talking about. \n\nIt is my opinion that the US is going to undergo a sustained economic downturn that will last throughout this calendar year and beyond. I believe this, in part, because of the large unemployment numbers that are coming out, and I understand that the economy cannot simply restart again when this all blows over. This will affect companies such as Tesla, along with many others. \n\nTL;DR: If people can't make money, the economy goes down. If the economy goes down, stonks go down.
