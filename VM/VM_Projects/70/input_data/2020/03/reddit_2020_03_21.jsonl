I think there's a big misunderstanding here of how passive ETFs work.\n\nLet's say everyone sells their SPY shares or whatever, instantly crushing the ETF by 10%. What happens is market makers will just short the underlying basket to offset what they just bought, driving down the prices of those stocks. And then they redeem their ETF shares to cover their shorts in the underlying basket, getting flat.\n\n So, in the case of the SPY, the whole S&P 500 will move proportionally (with some mismatch of course) - and if we're talking about passive ETFs in general (rather than just the SPY), then the whole market moves.\n\nA passive ETF selloff is just a market selloff. Not much different than if people all had individual stocks in their portfolios and sold those instead. It feels like a lot of people here don't realize passive ETFs are created/redeemed with the actual underlying stock baskets, so no one is stuck holding the ETF in particular (it can just be made into the component stocks).", "score": 22, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": ">This is unrelated to what op is saying. \n\nI disagree that it's unrelated, because of\n\n> the market itself is overvalued due to people passively investing in ETFs\n\nWhy bring up passive ETFs at all then instead of just saying \"the market\"? People invested and had retirement and non-retirement accounts well before passive ETFs became popular. If we're talking about a whole market selloff, then OP should be saying a whole market selloff (which was my point), he's the one who singled out passive ETFs (and I, like you, was pointing out that you can't single out passive ETFs from the market as a whole). By singling out passive ETFs, he made the post about how those in particular would sell off rather than the market as a whole.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Reread op.

And that's the part is disagree with - passive ETFs didn't *cause* the bubble (if there is one). If it is a bubble bursting, that overall market bubble could have happened even if passive ETFs didn't exist (because people would just be buying individual stocks instead).\n\n****\nEdit: Also, regarding possible over-valuation driven by passive ETFs being blindly invested in by retail investors, it's worth remembering that a lot of professional portfolio managers use passive ETFs as a convenient market short.\n\nI'm a former equity options market maker and then later fixed income quantitative trader and saw it / participated in that end firsthand. SPY, for example, as of last year had something like $40 billion in short interest (much or most of it likely blindly shorting it to hedge market exposure). So, for instance, if you were a leveraged hedge fund with $1 billion in capital (but far larger positions) and decided you wanted to place a $100 million bet on GOOG, you may short $100 million of SPY (or maybe the futures or through options) against that to isolate your Google specific exposure, because that's one of the easiest / most liquid ways to do that. Some fund managers you may see on CNBC talking about passive ETF bubbles are likely short those passive ETFs or a related product for a completely unrelated reason (as a hedge), but certainly wouldn't mind if they sold off a few extra percent relative to their long positions.\n\nThat would have a similar but offsetting effect of holding those names down, though, like I said elsewhere, you don't need anywhere close to most investors being active in order to have price discovery.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Passive ETFs can help to create the bubble.\nThey inflates prices of stock that have bad fundamentals.\n\nETFs are dangerous now that some stock will go to 0.....", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "The point isn't that ETFs did it.

The point is that people passively investing blindly into the top X stocks, created a bubble. \n\nExcept those are the companies that would have the vast majority of investments anyway. And the price isn't determined blindly - there's still price action on those stocks outside of the passive investment. Even if eventually something like only 20% of money was actively traded, that would be enough to have price discovery of individual names.\n\nThere are only several thousand publicly traded companies in the US anyway. The S&P 500 by its nature (regardless of the existence of passive ETFs) would already represent the vast majority of market value of publicly traded companies (that's just the nature of how the math works out). So, whether or not passive ETFs exist, the top 500ish companies would see most of the investment by retail investors (and otherwise).\n\nAnd more importantly, like I said, it doesn't take much active investment to have price discovery occur, even if most of the money was passive. The passive money (not surprisingly) is along for the ride.\n\n****\nEdit: also, regarding knowledge of how passive ETFs work, I'll admit that was a broader commentary on the sub, not just this thread.
