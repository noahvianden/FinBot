The competition was that electric cars would never happen, given what GM went through. \n\nAnd then when things did engage, they had Toyota. \n\nAnd then when the S model kicked in, everybody and their mother jumped on board while development continued on the Model 3. \n\nIt's not like Tesla had it easy. Competition comes in many forms. A lot of people said that Tesla will never make it. They still do. \n\nAs for batteries in long haul trucking there is not a single battery on this planet, or will be anytime soon, that can compete with internal combustion for the long haul. Maybe 300 miles and then a quick charge, which is not bad if there is no driver. But no battery is going to pull 80,000 pounds up a bunch of hills and then drive another 2,000 miles, which is what long haul is all about. \n\nTesla has \"batteries in its panties\". It can't even consider hydrogen. \n\nAnd in my opinion, Elon is a child. He's what George Lucas was to Star Wars. He's a pioneer in this space and pioneers are the first ones with their faces down in the mud and arrows in their backs. He has taught many in this space how it's done and what not to do, but at a big cost. He paved the way for Nikola. \n\nIf Tesla is to compete, it needs to partner, but I don't think Elon's ego will allow that. \n\nAs for the executive staff at Nikola and VectoIQ, I can't see anything wrong with them. A little green perhaps, but it's a software company. Look at what Amazon was. Uber. Google for that matter. \n\nIt's hard to tell, to know for certain. But Nikola has gone through 4 significant rounds of investing, has some interesting pre-order activity, has some partnerships, and seems to be on target to deliver a vehicle as early as mid next year. \n\nAnd the boys and girls at Vecto are some smart cookies. \n\nI really don't see much downside or any serious red flags on this one and I have yet to find a serious contender in the long haul space.
