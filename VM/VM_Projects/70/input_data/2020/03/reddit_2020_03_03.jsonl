{"title": "28 Y/O Male Seeking Established Brokerage for Companionship", "selftext": "Hi a little about myself if you're reading this,\n\nFirst of all I want to say I'm not looking for anything short-term.\n\nI am currently being financially and emotionally abused and seeking to cut ties with my brokerage.  At first I was impressed with the things my former brokerage let me do - at night I was approved to do things other brokerages never allowed me to do before.  Puts, Spreads - the type of stuff you only dream about as a young male with dreams of a good future and a great brokerage to have on your hip and show off to your friends.  Things have gotten worse and at this point I only have myself to blame by not moving on sooner.\n\nSo I, am seeking a brokerage that has been established for 20-100 years and has had it's bandwidth tested before.  I know it's forward asking for that but I don't want any data constriction and optimal flow is more important.  I would really like to be approved for Level III options but if you want to start it slow Level II options is ok too.  Please don't ask me for my portfolio size, income, years of experience if you approve me for these options; trust me I know how to leverage it and do it safely as my previous partner was a great teacher and I can't take that away from them.\n\nPlease let me know if there  are any *good* brokerages out there or if you all are flaky and focused on your apps all the time instead of the fundamentals of a relationship a man should have with a brokerage.  I know that sounds very nice guy but I just want to be able to buy TSLA calls at open.\n\n\\-TraderJoe69\n\nP.S. send one pic of your platform if you respond and in the subject please put the current weather outside so I know you're legitimate", "id": "fcqb56", "created_utc": 1583215586.0, "score": 644, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 71, "comments": [{"body": "I'm spending tomorrow with etrade.
