{"title": "Owens and Minors (Medical PPE) working with the US government.", "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\n**Interview with Cramer**\n\nIt happened on Friday evening, here's the [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAqPQKBXkWc).\n\n**Summary** \\- taken from the video and a bit of other sources (their website..etc)\n\nThere are many corona virus stocks out there but I think this one stands out.\n\n1. The CEO revealed that they are working with the US government. At the moment only large cap companies like MMM are known to be doing so. Being a small cap company the revenue from PPE (personal protective equipment) is going to increase OMI's value substantially.\n2. The market showed interest immediately after the Cramer show. Stock price went up 23.6% in AH immediately after interview.\n3. This company has distribution centers in the US and Europe for exporting medical supplies (perfect timing for Europe!)\n4. Manufacturing done in America! No supply chain issues. Other competitors who manufacture in China saw their production shut down due to the Lunar New Year and beyond due to the virus.\n\n**The Company**\n\nOwens and Minor ($OMI) is a global manufacturing and distribution medical supply company with offices in the US and Europe. They make masks and gloves and other crap that helps in the beer flu crisis. Their CEO, Ed Pesicka, originally an executive from Thermal Fisher, joined Owens and Minor about a year ago. He's been fixing the customer service which bled the company for years. Restructuring the company for the past 9-10 months back to industry standard. It beat EPS in the last 3 quarters. Ed Pesicka is getting results.\n\n**Meeting Demand**\n\nEd sees mask demand in NYC rise from 20k to 200k-300k per week in just one hospital. The company has ramped up production to meet demand in medical protective gear. From January to end of February there was an increase of 50 million mask production per month. They are **working closely with FEMA, the white house team, and HHS**.\n\nThere will be a substantial increase in future demand. CDC guidance on masks is expected to [change](https://twitter.com/DrMattMcCarthy/status/1243891663162019841) in next 10 days. Americans will be advised to wear masks in everyday life. Current recommendation is for high-risk groups only.\n\n**Exporting**\n\nThey seem to be in a position to sell masks to Europe as well as they have distribution centers there. Trump keeps saying we can sell ventilators to Europe. Why not sell other flu gear as well?\n\n60+ of their distribution centers are located in the US, with 11 in [Europe](https://www.owens-minor.com/our-solutions/distribution-and-warehousing/). Logistics already in place for exporting.\n\n**Comparing with other corona virus stocks**\n\nThe advantage of OMI over other similar stocks like APT is that we know they're working with the US government. Like MMM, but with a much smaller market cap. The revenue from the increased demand will make this stock undervalued.\n\n**Possible Future Catalysts**\n\n1. Change in CDC guidance. Americans wearing masks everyday.\n2. Name called by Mike Pence just like MMM! There will be a much more significant effect due to the market cap size.\n3. Earnings in two months. Expect it to beat EPS by a large margin due to the January to February ramp up with a very good guidance.\n4. (Thanks [dlctrades](https://www.reddit.com/user/dlctrades/))  Permanent change in consumer/hospital behavior regarding masks and other PPE. Coronavirus  is here to stay and that means hospitals will need to stock up the way  idiots bought TP in case of a Winter outbreak.\n\n**Magical Technical**\n\n1. This stock has not gone parabolic like the others like APT, CODX have. Still cheap!\n2. Blew away several resistance levels in AH after interview with Cramer - $6, $6.5, $7. Bounced off at $7.8\n3. Break out above resistance at $7.8, HUGE gap up to about $17. Now at 6.81.\n4. Comparing how much other small cap virus stocks have performed, this will jump to $15-$20 and falls back to about $10 (like the others). The size of the gap also suggests a jump of that size.\n\nTL:DR - $10 calls, ticker OMI.", "id": "fr3jk0", "created_utc": 1585475815.0, "score": 63, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 74, "comments": [{"body": "I like the DD, I don't like that its from cramer.

{"title": "The Economic Cause and Consequences of The Current Financial Crisis | Bubble Or Nothing | David Levy", "selftext": "full paper: [https://www.levyforecast.com/core/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Bubble-or-Nothing.pdf?fd85af](https://www.levyforecast.com/core/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Bubble-or-Nothing.pdf?fd85af)\n\nin depth discussion: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/audio/2019-10-18/how-private-sector-balance-sheets-changed-recessions-podcast](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/audio/2019-10-18/how-private-sector-balance-sheets-changed-recessions-podcast)\n\nThe U.S. business cycles that ended in the last three recessions involved progressively greater and more troubling risk-taking behavior. Each ended with worse financial fallout and a longer period of recession and weak recovery. Much has been written about the bubbles leading up to the commercial real estate deflation in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the crash of the tech stocks and the ensuing bear market of 2000-2002, and the deflation of home real estate and the debacle in mortgage-backed derivatives in 2006 through 2011. Yet analyses of the bubbles‚Äô causes invariably omit a critical point.\n\n*The evolution of the economy‚Äôs aggregate financial structure has, over decades, altered the playing field for financial decision makers throughout the economy, increasingly skewing their available options toward higher risks, lower returns, or both.*\n\nThis paper presents two facts that help explain economic and financial performance in recent decades and offers insights into the current business cycle, the 2020s, and beyond.\n\n1. Private sector balance sheets grew faster than income over many decades; thus, aggregate debt grew faster than aggregate income, and aggregate assets grew faster than aggregate income.\n2. This disproportionate balance sheet expansion changed financial parameters in the economy, mathematically making financial activity increasingly hazardous and compelling riskier behavior.\n\nThe first of these statements is an empirical observation, easily documented. The second is the result of direct logical deduction. Together, they have several consequences:\n\n* From the mid-1980s on‚Äî*the era of the Big Balance Sheet Economy*‚Äîfinancial decision makers have had to choose between progressively lower returns and higher risk.\n* Too much private sector debt relative to income has adverse consequences, of course, but so does an excessive total value of private sector assets relative to income. An extreme value of aggregate assets relative to income means meager yields and operating returns on assets, distorted financial decisions, and an economy vulnerable to asset price deflation.\n* Each successive business cycle in the Big Balance Sheet Economy era has started with proportionately larger balance sheets and has involved more reckless balance sheet expansion leading to even bigger balance sheets and a worse financial crisis.\n* Each successive crisis, with more bloated balance sheets to stabilize, was more difficult to resolve and therefore required the government to engineer dramatic new lows in interest rates, heavy fiscal stimulus, and other measures to stabilize economic conditions. The measures eventually overcame recession and chronic weakness, but in doing so they necessarily caused further expansion of balance sheets relative to income.\n* During the 2000s, either the housing bubble or some other set of highly speculative, excessively risky, and destabilizing activities was virtually inevitable.\n* Increasingly unsound risk taking has been occurring again in the 2010s.\n* The present cycle is almost certain to end badly. Although there are signs that balance sheet ratios are undergoing an extended, secular topping process, they remain extreme and will produce serious financial instability during the next recession.\n* There is no nice, neat solution to the Big Balance Sheet Economy dilemma, no blueprint for a politically acceptable resolution. The task of preserving prosperity while shrinking assets-to-income and debt-to-income ratios is, if not outright paradoxical, at least plagued by conflicting forces.\n* Government policy cannot prevent serious consequences when the Big Balance Sheet Economy corrects, but it can moderate them and help households, businesses, and the financial system cope with them.
