{"title": "Life after COVID 19", "selftext": "So, now that we're all deep in the shit - I'd like to lay out an argument about the post-Covid 19 world and the ways in which it may be vastly different from the world that existed before.\n\nMany of these thoughts are unoriginal and perhaps even mundane - several of them may be flat out wrong. I'll leave it to you all to decide for yourselves, though if you have any constructive thoughts I'd appreciate hearing them. This is a very long post and I'm sorry about that - skip to the end if you want for TL;DR.\n\nWhat has and will change?\n\n**1) Interest rates** and the state of play with respect to the world economy.\n\nSo, from what I've read, economic principles - for the most part are really more like economic hypothesizing because of the lack of controllable experimentation.  For example: say you wanted to test gravity - you drop shit and measure what happens. Do it enough times in enough ways and they write about you in all the history textbooks. Interest rates essentially control the supply of money in the economy and the vast majority of value is derived from the Fed's yield curves. But, there have been limited ways in which interest rates have been tested because on a macro scale, everything you do has a chance of just blowing the whole thing up. Complex consequences might be the best way to describe them.\n\nMany countries have gone negative - and the apparent tolerance for high yields is lower now than it was in the past. Why? Because there isn't any inflation. Where the hell is the inflation? Things are supposed to get more expensive over time, but they're not really.\n\nI'm glossing over why this is the case in a way that would make a macro econ professor have a brain aneurysm. But what is most important to note is that there HAS been inflation, just not where we've been measuring over the past few years. Inflation has occurred in assets. Why? Because that's the outcome of the system that we've built over the last several decades. Cheap money gets taken advantage of by wealthy people and institutions who can collateralize it with assets. Where do wealthy people put that borrowed money?\n\nA) Into milk and eggs by the millions and billions, driving up demand immensely creating traditional inflation\n\nB) Into other assets which can generate more profit and can be used to collateralize even more debt, in turn inflating asset prices beyond what their fundamentals would generally condone\n\nIf you picked B, good for you!\n\nWhy it matters: When the shit is over, eventually, it will be a long long time before interest rates start going back up. This means that assets will again balloon as money seeks returns.\n\nWhy no one cares to fix this: Because, it turns out that the super rich really love the chance to get super richer.\n\nLong term forecast: Assets regain value at a steady and unyielding clip similar to before COVID, but the rich have an even larger share of ownership and the world's wealth is even less equally distributed.\n\n**2) Technology**\n\nThe developed world's hand has finally been forced to embrace the cost of technology. Universities are moving classes fully online, businesses are sending people to work from home, patients are seeing their doctors through a screen, and eventually if this drags on long enough - or even if the lessons learned from it are utilized by C Suites - many many more jobs will be automated and faster than before. Why? Because human machines can get sick. They can break down en masse and cost businesses massive amounts of unexpected costs. These costs are unpredictable in any meaningful way, and increasingly, are by far more expensive than replacing them with machines that don't break down.\n\nWhy it matters: Some of life will return to normal when this is over. But, not all of it. Many universities will probably keep classes online to a greater degree than before. Telehealth infrastructure will be built out of necessity and its practicality will lead to continued adoption and implementation across the developed world. Working from home will become the norm for many industries which hadn't previously moved that way. And, automation, wonderful dreadful automation, will displace an even larger share of the workforce.\n\nLong term forecast: Substantial civic upheaval as low skilled and low wage workers become low skilled and no wage. Trump administration's interventions with doling out $$ to keep the wheels of the economy rolling will strengthen acceptance of Universal Basic Income and this will be broadly adopted although likely remarkably stingy and poverty will undoubtedly increase. Automation, telehealth, and working from afar will be a substantially larger share of the economic engine.\n\n**3) Industries will be left behind**\n\nCruises, movie theaters, restaurants, local shops, and big box stores will all be impacted in a permanent way from the effects of Covid. Why? Because they were already under siege by massive marketplace disrupters. (Well, not so much cruises, they're just old person shit and I don't foresee them being nearly as popular in the mid to long term.) Hollywood studios have already begun releasing their content directly to streaming services in greater numbers than pre-covid and by the time the crisis is over, I expect they'll find this new model to be even more attractive because of ease of logistics and human behavioral trends. We like our couches. Restaurants will give more ground to food delivery companies. This isn't to say that they'll go away, but rather that any restaurants that weren't playing the delivery game will be gonzo from the market. Local shops... well... they were on life support to begin with. Big box stores will see more and more of their sales move online as even the boomers are finally forced to learn how to use the Google.\n\nWhy it matters: Physical retail spaces, already lurching forward, may be dealt a finishing move by a microscopic scythe. Human behavior will move more of our interactions online than ever before - pushing forward all-encompassing the digital age far faster than before.\n\nLong term forecast: Cruise liners are less profitable as their passenger manifests dwindle. Movie theaters exist now only in a hipster kind of \"so this is how things used to be way\". Local shops die in a sudden and bloody way faster than ever before as their razor thin profit margins become a sea of red ink. This will hit the rust belt and the fly-over states much much harder than the coasts. Big box stores see their sales move online or dry up entirely - abandoning brick and mortar facilities accelerates.\n\n**TL;DR:** Interest rates will remain lower for the mid to long term future. Debt will be cheap and be abused more than before. Asset prices will go sky high again, this time held by the rich in even larger share. The digital age will have arrived far more completely than before. Low skilled and low wage jobs will be forever lost to automation. Physical retailers will be dealt a crushing and semi-permanent blow to the head - small mom and pops will be annihilated.\n\n**What does all this mean?**\n\nFAANG rapes the S&P 500's relative market capitalization like never before. The rich get richer even faster. The poor get much much poorer. Social unrest will increase to potentially nation-destabilizing levels.\n\nThe world is forever changed.

Now, I'm no economist, nor do I want to be one, but I think these claims are egregious. We're only two weeks into this mess, it took China almost two months to get back to work. The market is constantly testing new lows and portfolio managers on CNBC keep discussing the new risks that come with social-distancing procedures. Firms are more levered than ever, the Saudi's and Russian's are in an oil war which is inadvertently crushing U.S. oil companies that took huge loans after the Great Recession. Airlines, hospitality, cruises, restaurants, retailers, dentists, etc are being put on furlough. The hospitality industry itself is asking for $150bn to help get over this situation. Keep in mind the VERY controversial GM bailout was $11.2bn. Speaking of the auto industry, they will completely shut down starting tomorrow. Many states are also starting to make declarations allowing home owners and renters delayed payments.\n\nAs far as positions go, $200 SPY puts a month or more out. For those of you making tendies and feeling charitable, I ask to first consider donating to neighbors or friends with children.

I had followed WSB for the past few months, but wanted to be responsible with the money. So I bought 100 shares of AMC at $7.05 (now trading at $2.47). After trading hours I started reading up on this thing called the coronavirus and found  evidence from highly reputable scientists about this causing a global pandemic.\n\nMany people on another forum I read started thinking this virus would cause a global recession and that it would adversely affect the travel, tourism, restaurant and entertainment industries. I found the scientific research credible and thought the conclusions of these posters logical. Someone on that forum had a large position in $RCL and I decided to sell my $AMC shares and follow his lead. I put the entire 1k into $RCL 80p when it was trading at $91. That day I made more than 60% profit and sold my position. It was an incredible rush and I felt ecstatic! I took a week off trading but continued reading up on the coronavirus. \n\nI eventually decided to buy $SPY 240p when it was trading at $310 and quickly sold those puts for 50% profit. Once again the rush I felt was incredible. I currently have $1100 cash and $4200 worth of options in the account. I've certainly sold too early at times, but I've still made an absolute killing!\n\nOne might assume that I've had a terrific time, and I have, but I can't overstate how much stress this experience has caused me.

I simply don't think I can take this anymore. If this is what making money trading options feels like (for me) then I can't imagine how losing money feels.

The diamond hands Robinhood feature helped me a lot with that when it was happening because there was absolutely nothing I could do, so worrying wouldn’t change a damn thing. Having a total lack of control was scary at first, but I stopped checking as much on the second day and now I only check a couple times.\n\nI lost a  decent amount of my portfolio in the RH crashes (although I have since been able to make it back), but not having the ability to even look at how my positions were doing helped convert my mindset to a more solid-hands approach that has since made me a lot more money than it cost.\n\nStill, if this is hurting your mental health, there’s nothing wrong with leaving.
