Currently, I mainly have health care stock VIR, INO, MRNA, GILD, GSK, JNJ (aren’t they gonna go up by developing vaccines for the coronaviruses?). Also have some AAL and RCL with the hope that they’ll go up soon. I’m contemplating swallowing my pride, selling all my stock and deleting the trading account and never look back. What do you guys think I should do?, i have a decent salary and can keep all the stock as is and go back to it months or years from now.

You'll screw up again if you take the advice people give you here without doing any of your own research.\n\nSecondly, what do you want to do? Do you want to be a trader, or do you just want to make better use of your savings?\n\nIf you really want to be a trader then go out and read as much as you can. Not just from randos on Reddit, but books by actual experts. This isn't a simple pass time. I spend hours every day reading market news, analysing my portfolio and scouting potential trades, so don't expect to have much success if you can't put in at least an hour or two a day.\n\nAfter you've got the basics down deploy a little money and get a feel for things. You'll find the market works very different in practise to how you read it works in theory. Next start working on a strategy that works for you, and stick to it. I believe a strategy has to be congruent with you. I'm a techy by trade so I invest mostly in small-mid cap tech. I seem to have much less emotion when trading so I tend to trade with much more risk and leverage than most here, but I diversify that risk enough that overall I consistently profit. There's no point me giving you tips, because I doubt you'll be able to do what I can and I doubt I'd be able to do what you can. But once you have a strategy that works stick to it and change it with extreme caution.\n\nI personally think it takes at least 5 years to have any clue what you're doing, but perhaps I'm a slow learner. Only when you're confident you can consistently make money, that's when you begin deploying savings.\n\nFor what it's worth I've lost a huge amount of money this last month too so I wouldn't be too hard on yourself for losing money in this environment. I lost double what you've lost in total in yesterdays session alone. The only difference is I'm not worrying because I know I know what I'm doing. So sure, a 40% loss is bad, but in this market you could recover most of that very quickly if you play it right.\n\nIf you don't want to be a trader though I'd strongly advise you simply invest part of your savings in index funds. If you think you're a little more capable perhaps put some money in a few large-cap stocks. I think companies like MSFT and AAPL are good long-term bets. Both are also down considerably right now and should bounce back nicely when market fear subsides.\n\nBut whatever you do don't make decisions about individual stocks based on what amateurs here think. I absolutely guarantee you'll lose money doing that.", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "I work in investment, specifically in the life sciences sector.\n\nRedditors attitudes towards biotech and pharma company stock pisses me off daily. This idea that 'those stocks will go up because they're developing vaccines' is idiotic. Let me tell you why:\n\n1) The regulatory requirements to get a vaccine through testing means that you aren't going to see anything worth a damn for a **bare minimum** of a few more months. More likely, a year or more. \n\n2) Even if a company successfully produces a vaccine and gets it through trials with no issues, manufacturing is a **huge** undertaking. You think it's hard to scale manufacturing of consumer goods like games consoles? Try biologics products that have to adhere to very strict QC standards. Many companies making treatments of various kinds fail not because they can't make a useful product, but because they can't scale their manufacturing processes for shit.\n\n3) Every time outbreaks happen, multiple stocks will bounce around wildly. This is a mix of things including **speculative trading** and **opportunistic** pharma/biotech companies trying to grab the limelight. Whenever you see a company saying they have a drug that might treat a novel virus like this within weeks of it becoming a global issue, you should view it with heavy skepticism. \n\n4) I mentioned there will be multiple stocks bouncing around before. This is also a consequence of there being **many** companies trying to develop a vaccine but, really, the vast majority of them aren't going to be the ones who are successful. Hell, maybe none of them will be. What makes you think that **you're** going to pick the right one? \n\nFWIW, if it were my money I would basically *never* invest in a pharma/biotech company with a narrow pipeline because their success/failure is often binary. They either get a cure or they don't. They either moonshot or they tank in the long term. Big pharma are slightly different because they have more projects in their pipeline (and so their success is the summative value of all of those individual projects), but these little niche biotech stocks don't have the resources to have such a wide pipeline. \n\nLet VCs invest in those smaller companies, they have enough money to let some of it fail. They can invest in 20 of these companies and only need one to succeed to get a return.
