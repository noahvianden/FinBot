{"title": "Trading COVID-19 for March - An Illustrated Guide", "selftext": "I have come to realize the error of my ways last week, and a wall of text may have been a tad...unapproachable for this audience.  I have since revised my thesis to be much more image-oriented and a whole lot less text.  This is more like a child's picture book of charts and graphs.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/PtnTRMx](https://imgur.com/a/PtnTRMx)\n\nLong story short, I still think they market has not fully grasped what this is and early this week is a good point to start betting on either a small bounce with a precipitous drop to come while hedging against a complete recovery.  Nothing but bad news came out this weekend and I think the market corrected on the idea of a China disruption and eventual virus containment.  Large events being cancelled is signaling to the market that there is still a belief that this can be contained.  I don't think they have \"priced in\" the idea that this virus won't be contained, or they have and this week is a huge trap to get some last bit of dinero.  \n\n\"It's just the flu!\" - normal flu doesn't kill like this.  Normal flu doesn't put 10% of the world's population in quarantine.\n\n\"Summer is coming, that will stop the virus\" - Singapore, Thailand, Australia, and even Ecuador are seeing a rise in cases.  Ecuador - that's the damn equator.  It's perpetual summer there.\n\n\"This is an overreaction.  Media just hyping it up\" - called my mother back in the midwest this last week - she hadn't even heard of it.  We haven't even come close to peak fear levels yet imo.  US cases is still under 100 and we just had our first death.\n\nIn the Kubler-Ross Grief Cycle, we are still in denial.\n\nI'm looking for a good entry point today and then wagering half my \\~5k portfolio, saving the other half in reserve in case I'm terribly wrong or terribly right.   I would also bet on me being terribly wrong.   This is not a \"safe\" investment.  This is a \"I drive a 24 year old car that's dying and want a new one, but I also have a really solid job and if I'm wrong I'm only out next weeks paycheck and that's just $2.5k less I can blow in Vegas in a few weeks\".  As of finishing writing this the market has opened green but on it's way back down.
