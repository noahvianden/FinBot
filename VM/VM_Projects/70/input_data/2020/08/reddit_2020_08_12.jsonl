Or pretending that panel gaps and paint thickness are two of the most important things consumers look for in a vehicle.\n* Pretend that the plural of anecdote is statistics. Prime example is pretending that Teslas frequently catch on fire, even though in reality a Tesla is about as likely to catch fire as an ICE vehicle.

RealTesla had a user called something like FredsTake that parodies this behavior, and to be honest, it's accurate and funny.\n* Some bulls pretend that problems don't exist, e.g. arguing that early Model Y vehicles don't have any quality problems. I don't care much about paint quality or panel gaps so long as the vehicle is safe and the drive train is rock solid, and the same is true for most buyers, but the truth is, Tesla *does* underperform on some things, including but not limited to paint and panel alignment, and denying it is counterproductive, because it reduces the chances that those problems will get fixed.\n* I've been told a lot of Tesla skeptics get silently banned from Tesla positive subreddits including this one for very minor infractions.\n* The belief among many bulls that communities that are generally positive towards Tesla, but with some skeptics and some supporters of other brands, like r/electricvehicles are Tesla hostile.\n\nWhen I've weighed these issues, I've found one side weighs heavier than the other.", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": ">I've been told a lot of Tesla skeptics get silently banned from Tesla positive subreddits including this one for very minor infractions.\n\nHeh, if only.

Also, it’s my observation that fans of traditional automakers can be very upset about their “team” being beaten by Tesla in the marketplace, and will lash out at Tesla in frustration.  I see quite a bit of negativity towards Tesla in posts and comments there.  Some of that negativity is directed more towards Tesla fans for trashing other EVs, which can be a reasonable complaint. \n\nPersonally, I don’t mind at all if other automakers sell interesting EVs.

Besides, you are totally missing the point if you think Bitcoin is about beating Visa and PayPal.\n\n>Gold has value as jewelry.\n\nSure does and in electronics too. However, the price of gold is almost entirely at the levels it is due to it's monetary premium. I.e. people using it as a storehold of wealth. This is the reason it, in times of economic uncertainty, historically, has done well.\n\n>Currency has value as a cost effective medium of exchange. What is the intrinsic value of bitcoin?\n\nBy the finance definition of intrinsic value it has none. However, some people ascribe value to it because it is a borderless, permissionless, auditable money that is resistent to seizure or censorship by tyranical governments and not under control by some unelected gatekeepers with broken incentives.\n\nExperiencing hyperinflation while being unable to access the walled garden that is western financial institutions is a great way to understand why something like Bitcoin makes sense. Reading up on the history of money is another. I can recommend the \"Shelling Out: The Origins of Money\" by Nick Szabo if you are genuinly curious on the topic.

That’s the exact opposite of economies of scale.\n\nBitcoin having a fixed block size makes a ton of sense. If indeed transaction throughput scaled with demand and transaction prices were fixed at a very low level. Given enough popularity, participating in the Bitcoin network in a trust-minimized fashion where you validate and broadcast your own transactions would become costly and the eventual outcome would be the Bitcoin network consisting of a few large datacenters that could easily be shut down. The design would be self-defeating. \n\nAnything decentralized will be less efficient than a centralized alternative.
