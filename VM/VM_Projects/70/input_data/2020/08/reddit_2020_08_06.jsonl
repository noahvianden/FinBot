The point of each mission is to put something in orbit.  A satellite, some astronauts,  whatever the mission may require they almost never require max payload.  The Falcon 9 payload capacity to GTO is over 6 tons with booster recovery.\n\nSpaceX has flown 41% of their missions with reused boosters.  That figure is going to continue to climb.  SpaceX charges 20% less to fly missions using used boosters.  \n\n> Elon Musk even said that the reused boosters have a higher chance of failure.\n\nI don't believe a reused booster has every failed a mission.  But if you have info to the contrary let me know.  Do you have a source for this interview?  Was there other context like him saying something like, \"while that may be true, the chance is low enough that it still makes 100% sense to pursue reusability\"?  Even if it the chance of failure was somewhat significantly more, then you just use new boosters to fly human missions and repeatedly reuse them later on non-human payload missions.\n\n> Their integrated factory and vertical integration made it cheaper.\n\nAnd who decided to do that and made that possible?  Musk is not a stupid man.  He has working knowledge of physics, economics, management, electronics, software engineering and chemistry.  He knows that his role is to empower his employees rather than the other way around.  His companies attract smart engineers.\n\nOur discussion point was that SpaceX is a huge success story that will continue to grow. By all indicators Tesla is going to be a huge commercial success as well.  It took a lot of bold choices and solid engineering to make both of those successes happen, it didn't just fall into Elon's lap.  As others have said Boring didn't even start to dig these holes before hiring a lot of smart engineers to think through the sort of problems that would prevent it from being a practical success.  \n\n* It's extremely cost effective to run Teslas and apparently cheap to build these tunnels.  Apart from replacing tires and axel joints they have almost no operational maintenance needed.  The electricity cost is less than 4 cents per mile.\n* The Teslas run through the tunnel will be on autopilot.  \n* If one of the cars does break down they'll have recovery vehicles from each tunnel end point to tow it through.  It would probably take less than 20 minutes.\n* there are two tunnels side by side, in larger projects I've read there will be maintenance connections between them. \n* The distance for this project is only 0.83 miles and there's plenty of room in the tunnel, even with a failed Teslas in it, for people to walk to the tunnel exit in this unlikely scenario.\n\nEverything about it makes sense to me, and I'm pretty concerned about the practicality of things.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "Just watch and learn my friend.\nGreetings\n\n- The Cult", "score": 0, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "The point is to remove humans from the control loop during the transit phase.
