All automakers share their revenue with dealers and have no idea how to make battery cars and ramp up production for them while keeping good energy density. Tesla has been doing it and selling cars and been profitable while doing it which is really hard to do, but they are vertically integrated and constantly changing and improving their products. With every consequent Tesla sold they make a little more margin with the new improvements, as soon as Full Self Driving comes out it will cost a lot of money and Tesla will be profiting on most of it. Then comes the autonomy taxi service where Tesla plans to sell its cars in fleets to companies or just personally deploy them as taxis. There’s a lot more there including full vertical integration of energy as well with the solar panels and storage which allows you to sell extra energy.

Any company under hype screams risk and overvaluation.  But it depends on your goals. Looking for a quick profit? Maybe swing it. Honestly believe in the company and not buying for the stock gains?

If you're going to be in for the long run (let's say 10+ years) today's valuation is still very low.

If you're in Nio I'd highly recommend getting into Tesla too. One of them could disappoint, but it's unlikely both of these companies won't be way bigger than they are today with EVs becoming 100% of the car sales.\n\nIf you're looking for the new Tesla, it's still Tesla.
