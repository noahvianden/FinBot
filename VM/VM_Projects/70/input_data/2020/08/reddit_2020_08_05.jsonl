One’s knowledge and experience are definitely limited and there are seldom more than two or three enterprises at any given time in which I personally feel myself entitled to put full confidence.\" - John Maynard Keynes\n\n\"That fear of having too many eggs in one basket has caused them to put far too little into companies they thoroughly know and far too much in others which they know nothing at all. It never seems to occur to them that buying a company without having sufficient knowledge of it may be even more dangerous than having inadequate diversification.” - Phil Fisher\n\n\"If you can identify six wonderful businesses, that is all the diversification you need. And you will make a lot of money. And I can guarantee that going into a seventh one instead of putting more money into your first one is going to be a terrible mistake.

Once you have dominant market share, you can lose market share - say, half your market share - but you cannot aspire to gain much market share.  If you have over 50% of the market you cannot double your percent market share, for instance - it's mathematically impossible.\n\nThis pitch:  \"Oh, the competitor beats us on price and quality, but they're too small to threaten us\" has sunk many ships.  Anyone who thinks AMD and ARM don't want the business, or can't ramp production timely enough, is wearing blinders.\n\nThere's a difference between being 🌈🐻 and being able to see a broken company.\n\nEDIT:  Let's go into detail.  I have 40 or so friends who worked at AAPL, made a 20+ year career there.  Interestingly in the last 5 years most have left.   Some retired and now tool around Atherton in their McLarens with wife #3.  But let's look at INTC from an AAPL perspective.  INTC once owned processor.  They put Motorola, a great company, out of business about 5 years after Apple switched from PowerPC to x86 for their laptops.  Intel has always been thick as thieves with MSFT and Apple had to spend years at the negotiating table getting Intel to unlock the full power of their chips for an EFI based architecture instead of legacy Win 3.1 compatible DOS-baed bios.  I swear INTC was optimizing their chips for CP/M well into the 90s.\n\nI digress.  Apple came to x86 but about 5 years ago hired Chris Lattner to finish building llvm which is now the nasty nuts and bolts basis of Xcode, the free compiler for AAPL developers.  Only once that project was done and Lattner set adrift with his $20m in options was AAPL free to announce that, with their newly acquired platform-independence, they'd be moving off x86 to ARM.  ARM is a successful new power-friendly architecture that AAPL had a large hand in developing over the past 15 years as it has always powered the iPhone, and they have assessed (correctly imo) that the ARM platform is more flexible and friendly for the computing goals of AAPL's next 10 years of product pipeline.  Remember what happened the last time AAPL switched platforms for its big iron?  You still holding shares in Motorola Mobility?\n\nAbout, what, 4 years ago now Apple quit making network hardware (Time Capsule, it was called) and set their network team loose.  Interestingly, the guys I knew on that team spent most of their time attending conferences and lobbying hard in favor of free and open networking standards.  Once they got their major rivals to agree on a platform that would be free, open, and ready for the innovations AAPL intended to pile onto it for the next 15 years, their work was done.  AAPL cut them loose and more than half of the guys I know went to work for INTC.  INTC just recently discovered what AAPL already knew - there's no longer any edge to be gained in developing hardware for network because there's nothing proprietary, the guidelines baked that in - and now all those guys have jobs elsewhere.\n\nMust I go on?  INTC's failed attempt to build a mobile chip?  INTC's failure to penetrate the SoC/IoT market for chips that run TVs and such (Samsung)?  I have a fucking lightbulb on my home Internet network and Intel doesn't even seem to know such products exist.  Even the Kin and Zune were ARM projects so let's not try to compare architectures on whether they ensure product success.  The point is, x86 was built for MSFT and MSFT had abandoned it for innovation as far back as 2005.\n\nBut it's entrenched and has share, you point out.  It's the world's dominant architecture and Intel has mastered the art of node-process-optimization cycles -- ahahahahaaaaa ok 7nm see ya when I see ya, we were supposed to be running 5nm by now and learning about the new architecture that was to replace it.  I talk to people inside INTC and there is no new architecture.  There is no quantum advance that lets x86 go to 4.5 nm, or 4nm, or 3nm.  Intel's fabs can't even fab what the current litho teams are putting out, they'll be outsourcing that to TSM for the very first time.\n\nThere is literally nothing they are doing right at the moment.  [Look at this announcement](https://newsroom.intel.com/news-releases/intel-changes-technology-organization/?linkId=100000013796181), this is a company famous for promoting from within and they can't even find an external candidate to lead Design Engineering because everyone in the biz knows the whole division is a flaming turd floating over the Marianas Trench and about to sink.\n\nMeanwhile they just promoted [Ann Kelleher](https://newsroom.intel.ie/news-releases/intels-ann-kelleher-honoured-with-prestigious-sfi-st-patricks-day-science-medal-in-washington-dc/) who has been a 'strong advocate for gender equity'.  Look at that tank of a woman, I'd hire her to back up Vince Wilfork, she'd collar Marshawn Lynch without any trouble. (I once knew a special ed teacher who looked just like her.  The extra mass comes in handy when a gang of obese retards decides to kick up their heels and party like it's 1999.)

I can see that Apple just spent a great deal of money and effort on llvm and it is clear enough that they did so in order to go platform agnostic.  Since they had been coexisting peaceably enough in an ARM/x86 world for a long while I feel like they would not have done that unless there was a compelling reason to do so.

Companies make expensive mistakes all the time.  However, Apple does not deploy capital for no reason.  Right or wrong, the decision to develop llvm and shoehorn it in as the foundation piece of the Xcode compiler was not done without intent; it was intentional.  I do not believe that the primary reason for doing it was to enrich Chris Lattner.\n\nYou've misunderstood me, anyway.  llvm is not the future, it's just one tool that is integral in allowing a widely deployed end-to-end software architecture go platform-agnostic.  The decision to go platform-agnostic was so counter-inertia that it had to have been deliberate; companies that are coasting on their laurels do not often re-engineer their whole product foundation for no reason at all.
