{"title": "Why you should trade futures - WSB Edition", "selftext": "*Note: all numbers are approximate. Do your own research. I'm sure I fucked something up, so let me know what and I'll fix it.*\n\nAlright, ignore my flair for a minute. I earned it, but that doesn't take away from everything else I'm going to say. This is why you should get approved for futures, especially before the end of the month if you can.\n\n**- Leveraged as fuck**\n\nSo you wish you had the $33,000 to be able to trade 100 shares of SPY, right? Even with margin, you're looking at tying up $16,500 just for them to hold in case SPY drops by 50% (it won't) and that's a terrible use of leverage. You can buy a fucking house with less money down (percentage-wise). /ES is the equivalent of 500 shares of SPY (it's really 50xSPX, but you get the point) and only uses $13,000 or so in buying power so you can ride those waves with way less money in use. You can also trade /MES which is the equivalent of 50 shares of SPY with only $1300 or so, so with $2600 you can emulate having 100 shares of SPY. Way better use of margin, right?\n\nI should add a note here that you have to be prepared to have it go against you too, so don't trade two /MES contract if your account is only $3000 because a 4 point SPY move will take your account out and put you in a margin call.\n\nAll the people playing GLD and SLV? If they have the cash, they could trade straight up futures (with this leverage, do you really need options?). For example, /SI is $11,000 in BP, but it equals 5,000 ounces of silver. So those two-dollar moves? That's right: $10,000 in profit. They have mini versions of the metals too, so if you're scared of /SI swings (like I am), you can trade /SIL which is 1,000 ounces, so a fifth of the moves and a fifth of the leverage. There are also mini-oil, mini-natgas, currencies and mini-currencies. If you really are confident in bushel price of wheat going up, you can trade shit like what, corn, soybeans. My broker doesn't offer Lean Hogs, but if yours does, you can join the retarded Lean Hogs Gang.\n\n**- 23 hours a day, 5 days a week**\n\nMost products trade 23 hours a day, 5 days a week including the Nasdaq, Russell and S&P500 futures. They start at 5pm Central Time (CME Time) on Sunday and run to 4pm Central Time on Friday. Ever watched futures rocket green as fuck, get your dick in your hand ready to go, just for it to reverse overnight and be flat by morning? Imagine locking in your gains at night on a /ES call instead of waiting for open to get fucked on your SPY calls. Or scalping $5 per point with a long or short /MES contract when you see the move coming (or $50/point for /ES).\n\n**- Hedging (we don't do that here)**\n\nSo I know this isn't the most risk-averse place, but you can go long or short any contract with no borrowing fees. There's no \"hard to borrow\" bullshit in futures, so you can pick an opinion, and hedge your 100 SPY 220p FDs with a long /MES overnight just in case it goes completely against you. You can also scalp /ES or /NQ options overnight when the Europeans sell off all their gains that you paid for.\n\n**- The options are coming, the options are coming**\n\nThe micro-S&P and the micro-Nasdaq are both getting options soon so you'll be able to buy /MES and /MNQ calls and puts starting August 31st. I have no opinion on how these will work until they roll out, but if you ever dreamed of having 100 shares of SPY and selling covered calls for easy income, you'll be able to but two /MES contracts and sell calls against them. You can also sell naked puts/calls for thousands less in buying power (if they don't get blown through of course) on those two micro products.\n\n**- No fuckery**\n\nSpeaking of SLV, people have been posting all the reasons that JPM fucks with the SLV ETF and to be honest, I've never read them. But /SI is a deliverable contract of 5,000 ounces of silver. No management fees for the ETF, no oversight. Straight up fucking contract at what price you're willing to buy the silver. The products are pure and pretty self explanatory.\n\n**- No PDT Rule on any products ever**\n\nThe CME has no daytrading rules, so you can buy/sell all goddamn day without getting your account fucked for 3 months. I constantly see people on here talking about \"Well, I have to have diamond hands since I'm out of trades.\" You'll never know that feeling again.\n\n**New smaller futures**\n\n\"But lucasandrew, I don't want to get completely fucked with a 2% move against me!\" I get it. The Small Exchange was made by the guys who made tastyworks and are available most places that futures are offered. Their products take $100 to $500 in buying power and the notional value for all of them is extremely simple. Each penny move in the price is $1. They have /SM75 which is the 75 most-volatile stocks they could find with equal weightings by industry. They also have /SFX with dollar exposure where you go long if you're bullish in USD and short if you're bearish. It's weighted against multiple currencies instead of just one so individual events in Australia don't totally fuck your position. They're also releasing an interest rate product, a small oil product and more coming up. You can see all the deets at www.thesmallexchange.com. These products are getting options once they have approval too.\n\n**- Warnings**\n\nIf you just got your first Robinhood account and they hooked you up with a Hertz share you're trying to daytrade, FUTURES ARE NOT FOR YOU. If you've been around a little bit and understand the risks you're taking, they are, in my humble opinion, about a million times better products.\n\nThe leverage is awesome and a bitch. If SPX moves 40 points down in a day and you're long /MES, you're out $200. If you're long /ES, you're out $2000. Know how to use the leverage in your favor and how to handle if it goes against you.\n\n**SOME PRODUCTS ARE DELIVERABLE**. Remember people buying oil contracts for negative money? That wasn't a flaw in the design. It was that nobody could store 5,000 barrels of oil, so they were literally paying people to take the oil contracts off their hands. The equities futures products are all cash-settled, so you'll never have to take delivery, but wheat, corn, soybeans, ~~(presumably) lean hogs~~ and oil are all physical products that if you hold until expiration, you have to accept physically at a predefined location. See the CME website for contract details that will tell you if it's physical delivery or cash. Or, do yourself a favor and know when the contract ends and get the fuck out or roll before that date.\n\n*- TL;DR* futures are the ultimate WSB tool and not a lot of people understand anything about them. The micros are getting options on August 31st, so you can daytrade some equivalent of SPY/SPX to your heart's desire. Tastytrade has a beginner's course and so does the CME. If you don't understand futures or don't feel confident, take them both.\n\nPositions: Long /MES, Long /M2K, synthetic strangle on /RTY, credit put spread on /NG\n\nEdit: Looked it up and lean hogs are cash settled.\n\nEdit 2: Screenshot of positions as requested: https://i.imgur.com/6QHSavc.png", "id": "i3qkex", "created_utc": 1596571210.0, "score": 33, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 75, "comments": [{"body": "so you're saying buy 1000 contracts of lean hogs and demand physical delivery on the floor of the CME", "score": 17, "replies": [{"body": "You got me thinking, so I looked up the CME contract specs.
