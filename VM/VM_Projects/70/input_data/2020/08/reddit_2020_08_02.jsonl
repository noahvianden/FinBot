{"title": "PTON - The most bullish i've ever been on a stock", "selftext": "I wrote this up earlier for why PTON is positioned for exponential growth over the next 5 years. I'd love to hear any counterpoints that I may not have considered.\n\n1. They have been selling every bike they have, the wait times are between 5-10 weeks to actually get your bike. The people delivering the bikes have talked about how crazy busy they've been. They are going to sell every bike they can make this year.\n2. For gyms that have been allowed to open up, people are not flocking back to gyms. Imagine many people touching the same equipment, breathing heavily near each other (increased minute ventilation due to exercise = increased probability to spread). Especially other cycling places like soulcycle or orange theory fitness - they have very small gyms and have had to cut down their capacity to less than 50% and are making people wear masks (most people are hating having to work out in masks, and many are hating not being able to get a spot in a class they've paid a ton of money for). Go to the orange theory subreddit and search peloton, many people bought a peloton and aren't going back to orange theory. ([https://www.reddit.com/r/orangetheory/comments/gsl1hy/peloton/](https://www.reddit.com/r/orangetheory/comments/gsl1hy/peloton/))\n3. The brand \"Peloton\" has become a status symbol, similar to apple and lulu. It is now a $BECKY stock. No brand has ever become positioned like this to take hold of the fitness sphere before (no not even bowflex, it did not have the same brand appeal, and continued consumer engagement with live classes/subscriber model).\n4. The live classes are amazing and the many hosts they have are each now celebrities on their own, Peloton has a cult following\n5. They were spending insane amounts of money on marketing, since COVID started and demand outgrew supply, they stopped most of their marketing (saving them tons of money)\n6. The connected fitness model with live classes is not just a covid play, it was going to happen regardless and COVID just sped it up\n7. Peloton is not just a workout equipment maker, each of their cycles has a $40 per month subscription for their live classes. During COVID, the number of people attending these classes has exponentially increased\n8. They also have a $13 per month app for live workout classes that has become very popular during COVID.\n9. They are expanding to other countries, most aggressively in Europe\n10. They have an impressively low churn rate (loss of subscribers), they are consistently beating their subscriber goals quarter by quarter\n11. They have new products that they will be announcing, including likely a cheaper bike and an a mostly confirmed cheaper treadmill\n12. Their most recent earnings were great, and this only captured about 1-2 weeks of the COVID surge, this next earnings report will show just how well positioned they were for this surge.\n13. Using google trends, Peloton seems to have a dominant hold on the market when compared to nordictrack and echelon [https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&q=peloton,nordictrack,echelon](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&q=peloton,nordictrack,echelon)\n14. Peloton's are also being placed in many hotel gyms and are becoming increasingly common in high end apartment gyms\n\n\\- What could limit this stock: If they are not able to adequately ramp up manufacturing, but they have said that they were greatly adding manufacturing capacity for the past 4 months.\n\nCommon thought \"I would never buy a $2200 exercise bike with a $40 subscription fee, so I don't believe in PTON.\" Me either, it's not the right product for me and how I work out, but I can't ignore that there are millions of people that it is right for.\n\nThink about it this way, orange theory fitness (with over 1 million members)and soul cycle gyms are very expensive to go cycle in yet they are packed - orange theory is 160 per month and soulcycle is about $30-40 per class. Someone can get a Peloton with 2 year 0% financing and it comes out to $90 per month. People already spend a decent bit on gyms. So a married couple that both goes to orange theory pays $360 per month (and even if they chose the lower 8 classes per month each at $100 per month it's $200), they save a decent bit of money with PTON. And at the end of those 2 years they own the bike and are only paying $40 per month. People that work out are trying their best to stay fit during covid, perfect timing for PTON.\n\nWatching their CEO discuss their growth and boom in sales was very encouraging on NPR's How I Built This recently was also great, highly recommend watching this.\n\nCurrently awaiting an earnings date, likely 3+ weeks away despite the estimated dates floating around.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: stock's dead lol", "id": "i2e4tn", "created_utc": 1596383077.0, "score": 47, "upvote_ratio": 0.72, "num_comments": 97, "comments": [{"body": "Watch David Lee’s video on PTON.

{"title": "PSTHU margin play", "selftext": "So on friday, I decided to sell most of my other positions and use most of my available margin (like 90%) to buy PSTHU.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/ouQd1Nh\n\nThe way I look at it this is a low risk, high reward play. Since this is a SPAC, shares can be redeemed for 20$+interest anytime before merger which essentially creates a floor making it extremely unlikely to trade below 20$. This is the reason I'm very confident that, even with using so much margin, my account wont go tits up. Trading at 21 right now, it's bassically a no brainer.\n\nThat's the low risk part, now for the high reward.\n\nThis particular spac is managed by Bill Ackman, who, aside from his big herbalife short, has one of the best track records on wall street. They have between 4-7 billion dollars to merge with a company (which is by FAR the highest amount any spac has ever had to play with). They are only looking at merging with a company with a market cap of over 10 billion dollars. \n\nJust know that it this isnt a tendies next week play, it's more of an insurance that I wont blow up my account buying OTM tesla calls play. It will take some time before this prints (months possibly even a year+) but I'm ok with that knowing I cant possibly blow up my account. Also since this is trading as units right now, it's not available on robinhood or webull until the units split into shares and warrants in mid september. So get a real brokerage if you want in on this.\n\nEdit: AAPL calls printed, added another 700 units to my position, total is 2300 now\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/RbuJXAQ.png", "id": "i2fms7", "created_utc": 1596388377.0, "score": 36, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 76, "comments": [{"body": "I'm treating this SPAC like a bank account.
