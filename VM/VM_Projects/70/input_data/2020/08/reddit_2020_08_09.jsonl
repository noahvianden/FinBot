{"title": "Unusual Option Flow Summary Week of August 3rd – ADBE, CNK, FB, MSFT, SDC, SNAP, V", "selftext": "Good morning fellas. Swaggy is back with a Sunday morning read and summary of unusual options activity for the week. I've highlighted some plays that came across as unusual based on how far OTM the bet was, the premium paid, and the volume of contracts in the play. If you want to check out additional tickers for yourself, you can scan the [unusual option flow tracker](https://www.swaggystocks.com/dashboard/stocklabs/option-flow) that I use at your liking (it's free).\n\n**ADBE – Adobe**\n\nSaw a bullish position in ADBE being opened with a debit spread. My scanner missed the long leg being opened, but I managed to catch the play by digging deeper. I’ve added the OI from Yahoo Finance so you can see the contracts. Stock is currently sitting at $450 after Friday’s -3% move. The debit spread was in October’s $450 strike (long leg) and sold the $490 strike (short leg). Earnings aren’t until September 15.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c5zwew1t8zf51.jpg?width=3264&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=aeb0137a19b57af372a8bc574686146ec796933b\n\n**CNK – Cinemark**\n\nA bit of an unusual ticker for unusual activity. Cinemark saw some pretty heavy call buying on Friday. The stock has been on a bit of a run recently. One player bought calls 80% OTM for the $20 strike (stock is currently $11). This play was only $55k, but highly suspect with how far out the money they went. The play has an expiration date for September 18. I’ve attached Yahoo Finance option chain for August 21 so you can see the heavy volume in the near OTM strikes. This stock typically does not have high volume with options.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xfl6sgou8zf51.jpg?width=3264&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3c240cd54686a66f589a3733cc3a44437c29467d\n\n**FB – Facebook**\n\nFacebook had a huge melt up Thursday and Friday. Volume on option activity was well above the average for the last 2 weeks. Saw a good amount of CALL buying with some CALL selling far OTM as well. Most of the call selling (potentially covered calls?) were done with expirations in the next 1-3 weeks. The call buying had expirations toward the end of the year and even into 2021. Long-term bullish.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h59saplv8zf51.png?width=2856&format=png&auto=webp&s=b36f92032e3c7444ec4f41e4a83bc22468518393\n\n**MSFT – MicroTok**\n\nMicrosoft saw a massive bullish debit spread opened in November 2020 calls. 75,000 CALL contracts bought with the $220 strike while selling 75,000 CALL contracts at the $240 strike. Looks like the player/fund is expecting upside, but wanted to limit their downside by opening a spread. They have a max risk of $49 million with a max reward of $150 million if MSFT closes above $240 by November.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/804hwqew8zf51.png?width=2858&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f76633f4b0db8220a1d1053daa8f54f5b796121\n\n**SDC – Smile Direct Club**\n\nAnother unusual ticker, this stock saw some unusual call buying recently. Two trades in particular were for next week’s earnings report (August 12). Both trades are for $9 strike, which is currently in-the-money. When the trades were initiated the stock was trading at $8.82. Judging from the OI it looks like of the 16k contracts traded, only 10k are left on the Open Interest. He may have sold part of his position to collect profit, but left a lot on the table for next week.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m4ish39x8zf51.png?width=2740&format=png&auto=webp&s=08d9b879e6326f3a90959a6c2e9087da82ab9c1c\n\n**Snap – Snapchat**\n\nSnap saw extremely high volume of call options traded relative to it’s average. Bullish flow out-weighed bearish flow by 3.5 to 1. Could be potential TikTok play as they expect the ban to increase their own share. There’s was a lot of flow to go through on this ticker, so I’m only mentioning that flow in general was above the average here and also more on the bullish side.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iy8yygxx8zf51.png?width=2858&format=png&auto=webp&s=a02ccb95317ec638ac9566cbae050a86c6067d22\n\n**V – Visa**\n\nVisa saw some unusual option flow last week on Wednesday. That day alone the stock gapped up 2% and closed another 3% higher. Stock is currently trading at $196 and most of the call blocks had strikes of $202.5-$205. Visa generally does not have that much volume on option flow so it’s always interesting to keep an eye on. If you look at the price action of the stock is has been in range-bound trading in the $190-$200 channel for almost 3 months now. Hit’s $200 and drops back down to $190, then touches $190 and makes it’s way back up to $200. Maybe some flow rolling through will be enough to have it break out.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l7wovjqy8zf51.png?width=2860&format=png&auto=webp&s=92e352e915225089fb7e9f31524ed1fe04cbdefd", "id": "i6j8e3", "created_utc": 1596979290.0, "score": 345, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 72, "comments": [{"body": "Thanks for this!!", "score": 49, "replies": [{"body": "Ya I find him, and unusualwhales.com the best sources for unusual options.", "score": 44, "replies": [{"body": "Do you pay for unusual whales?

If CF, or FA, has “too many plays to follow,” then maybe you shouldn’t subscribe to these types of services as CF is already filtered down a significant amount of the data flow. It’s quite hard to imagine an unfiltered (direct) feed from the exchanges, even if you could somehow afford the $75k/month the CBOE/data shops fee’s. But if that’s the case then you aren’t subscribing to a retail focused service in the first place. \n\nAll that being said, you only really need to focus/trade off one of those plays profitably to pay for the monthly service fee.

I took a look at your site, great work!. Is there some reference guide as to how to use and interpret the parameters such as Minimum Premium (why not only look at the big whale flows $1M+), Days to Expiration, OTM (is there some indication that 1-5% OTM calls/puts are more significant, Volume to OI?", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "That's a great idea, I should probably put together a guide. I'll answer a few here.\n\nFirst, yes bigger more expensive plays are a good tell for unusual activity. If someone is laying down $5 million it's showing confidence in the play. Those positions are typically 0-5% OTM or sometimes even slightly in the money.\n\nAnother tell are some plays that are extremely OTM, like 15%+. This would be similar to a lotto play and normally because how far OTM they are they can be dirt cheap. These are the high risk/high reward plays because if they don't work out they are going to $0 very fast. Someone buying 10k contracts at 25% OTM might only pay $50k for the position, whereas 10k contracts on the same stock/expiration but only 2% OTM would be much much more expensive (and also less risk).\n\nAlso, the Volume to OI is good to use as a guideline only. If Open Interest is 30 and the volume on the play is 10,000 you can see it's quite unusual. On the other side if OI was sitting at 12,000 and 10,000 volume comes through, it's not as \"unusual\". You also don't know for sure if those contracts were opening position or closing position until the next day. If the next day the OI has changed to 22,000 then you know the contracts were opening position. If the OI dropped to 2,000 then you know the player closed an already existing position.", "score": 15, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I think volume and OI is best used as an indicator for which strike is \"trending\" and will likely have tighter spreads (bid/ask range).\n\nLike you said if you look at volume and it's at 10k and then changes to 11k, you don't really know what is going on. If volume for the day is 0 and then all of a sudden a big block comes through and is now at 10k, based on various metrics you can tell if it was buy or sell-side. You also don't know what other positions might be linked to that one block, it's nearly impossible... But you can use option flow to gauge sentiment and see what is \"trending\", then ask if its trending bullish or bearish and you will be able to make assumptions.\n\nThere's no clear cut answer for the stonk market. The best strategy will always be buy and hold on strong companies, but other than that you can find ways to see what is trending and possibly what is smart-money doing.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "A guide would be a great thing for people like me who are just beginning!", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "[I made somewhat of a guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SwaggyStocks/comments/i2cwm1/unusual_options_activity_option_flow_what_it_is/) here.

This unusual option flow is \"unusual\" for screen trading (trading on exchanges). OTC trading though makes the bulk of the flow.\n\nBuying/Selling USD 500k premium for options is a really, really small amount for an equities derivatives desk at a bank and it happens for a single trader multiple times a day (heck an hour). Even a single ticket of USD 5mm isn't something to bat an eye about for an otc desk (happens also few times day).\n\nWith that said, the Microsoft trade however was indeed unusual. Copying these trades though is also ill advised. It could be the case that hedgefund A has bought 20mm premium from bank B. Bank B then proceeded to partial hedge this position on screen. If retail trader C tries to copy now the trade from Bank B, it might be the case, that you are taking the opposite position of hedge fund A (informed trader), which has a negative EV", "score": 8, "replies": []}, {"body": "I personally think SDC is going to go up a good amount.\nAfter entering the Walmart scene and browsing the confirmed purchase reviews on the site which is pages long.
