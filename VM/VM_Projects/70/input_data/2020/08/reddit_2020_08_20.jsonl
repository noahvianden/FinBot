Take your $30k and buy lots of 100 shares of shit that's between $30 - $50 per share and sell covered calls!\n\nYou'll have shares and some income.

This week had HD, LOW, NVDA and TGT. Only TGT beat expected amount and you would have \"lost\" (could have bought at 124$ a couple weeks ago and sold a $140C for about 2.50.\n\nYou still would have made $250 + $600. All the others, you'd pocket the call money and still had the stock.\n\n**Also, we're way overdue for a pullback. I recommend spending $100-200 in VXX calls as insurance.
