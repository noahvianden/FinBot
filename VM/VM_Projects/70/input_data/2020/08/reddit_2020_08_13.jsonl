{"title": "ATTN EVERYONE: A low stock price does NOT make a company \"cheap\" or mean it is a \"value\" stock.", "selftext": "Please do some research before your jump into these (always) uncertain waters. When I started investing in 2015, I made decisions based on what I could afford - \"I can buy more shares of this stock though because it's cheaper,\" I told myself. A work mentor of mine, who is twice my age, told me that's not how I should look at the stock market. He would always say, \"If you have $500 bucks invest $500 bucks. Don't make your decision on how many shares you can get. Your return is based off how much money you put in, not how many shares you have.\"\n\nIt took awhile for me to understand this. Myles Udland (Yahoo Finance) wrote an [article](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sector-style-rotation-rocking-stocks-market-morning-brief-100619474.html) this morning speaking to this point. It seems that lower share price stocks have outpaced higher share price stocks since the highs last Thursday. Not a long sample by any means, but this seems to be a reversal trend which seems to be accelerating. IMO, I can't help but think it's a <broker that shall not be named> type of push.\n\nFrom the story, \"And as the [firm’s table](https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/BUdiOORBcBgSmuUOZAeEpg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTg3MC41ODIxNDc0NzczNjA5/https:/s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/dxqJQKCHaq1i1tp346lJGA--~B/aD03MDE7dz03NzM7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https:/media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/f75bf530-dcbd-11ea-b37b-2f0e89cf2d74) shows below, cheap stocks, shorted stocks, stocks hated by analysts, and stocks that had lagged during this \\[COVID\\] recovery all outperformed Friday through Tuesday.\"\n\nIf you are interested in what truly does make a stock cheap or an attractive price, please read, \"[The Four Basic Elements of Stock Value](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/fundamental-analysis/09/elements-stock-value.asp),\" on Investopedia.

Nothing much except everything is on track. It seems the US phases 2 study will complete first than the global phase 2 / 3.\n\n**Note that it hits news because the independent committee reviewed 12 patients, and there will be another review and positive news for 24 patients (in next 2-3 weeks I believe. Because they should already have 24 patients, based on >50% enrollment and 40 patient target), then final result.**\n\nNot sure how stock market will react to this news though. To me the progress is within expectation, but stock has been dirty cheap in past few days like a COVID medicine does not matter.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Update on 8.21:**\n\nARK is bagholding more shares:\n\nAs of 8/20, their holding stands at 181K. To put it into context, they held about 65K by end of Q1, increased to 171K by end of Q2 (when stock price was $7). And after Q2 earning call, they added another 10K shares averaging about $8 during the past week.\n\nSo ARK is more bullish after the earning call --- they didn't add when stock is between 7-10 before Q2 ER, but now willing to add significantly at $8 after ER.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn short interests and Q3 outlook:\n\nRDHL short interests is currently at 2.1M shares, comparing to about 30M shares in total, or about 6%. The actual amount is quite high but not extremely high, say MRNA has 8% short interest, TSLA has 8% (historically 15-20% before the rise), etc.However, RDHL has a very low daily volume about 1% of the total shares => days to cover for RDHL is a whopping 6 days, and it is only 1 day for MRNA or TSLA. As we have seen with TSLA, short squeeze + long buying can do miracle ---- stock x5 in a few months.\n\nThis creates a perfect setup for RDHL to x5 or x10 by year-end, if-- covid medicine trial is successful, and they announce global ramp-up production plan;-- they beat Q3 revenue and profit (current estimate is 25M revenue and -0.06 profit, which seems quite easy to beat based on Q2 earning call and my main thread analysis)-- they can give a bright Q4 and / or 2021 guidance based on existing products + covid medicine.\n\nFrom the historical market cap, the shorts are looking at a 25% short-term gain at best, while facing an almost sure long-term loss (due to existing product growth) + potential huge loss in short-term (due to COVID medicine).How high stock can go will also depend on Macro and vaccine news --- and even if a vaccine is succesful, RDHL's own COVID medcine can still add a 2-3 years additional revenue (I assume it at least takes 2-3 years to fully deploy vaccine), plus huge reputation increase.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Update on 8.19:**\n\nAnother day stock price is consolidating on low volume. Without any news, stock will keep trading at low volumes for a few weeks --- more likely to slowly go up IMO. This could be a good time to DCA-in before medicine news and Q3 earning.\n\nAlso, more institutions are loading up RDHL based on recent 13F (by 6.30):  [https://fintel.io/so/us/rdhl](https://fintel.io/so/us/rdhl). Other than ARK, the other big names include Fidelity (FBIOX, new holder with 100K shares), Goldman Sachs (50K shares, 180% increase over Q1), Susquehana (40K share, 70% increase). Since stock price is much higher now, they probably increased their holding in Q3, but we won't know til after another 3 months.\n\nInterestingly, many other major banks (BoA, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, UBS group) also hold RDHL. They all increased their holding (except MS) in Q2, but each of them hold less than 10K. Considering they are very large banks, their small yet increasing stakes in RDHL are very interesting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Update on 8.17:**\n\nAfter the surprising 2-day post ER drop, Stock is coming back on average volume.\n\nHopefully the post ER profit taking is done (throw out all weak hands!), and the stock will resume into a slow rise mode in anticipation of COVID medicine news & revenue growth prospect in next two months.\n\nIf the upward trend can continue throughout this week, it will be a solid signal the market is buying into RDHL potential.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Update on 8.13:**\n\nARK is actually bagholding more shares during the post-ER dip.\n\n[https://ark-funds.com/wp-content/fundsiteliterature/holdings/ARK\\_ISRAEL\\_INNOVATIVE\\_TECHNOLOGY\\_ETF\\_IZRL\\_HOLDINGS.pdf](https://ark-funds.com/wp-content/fundsiteliterature/holdings/ARK_ISRAEL_INNOVATIVE_TECHNOLOGY_ETF_IZRL_HOLDINGS.pdf)\n\nIt was about 172K shares before ER, last time I checked on 8.11.\n\nNow it is 177K shares at 8.13.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Update on 8.13**\n\nQuestion from stalin\\_lost: Where do you see the price going if opaganib is not successful?\n\nMy take: If opaganib is not successful, the existing two products alone will bring a yearly revenue of 150M or more in 2021, and on an increasing trajectory due to Talicia growth. GILD is trading at 4\\*yearly revenue, so RDHL shall at least have a market cap of 600M, about $16 for the stock.\n\nThe revenue growth prospect makes me believe this stock is a safe pick and very undervalued fundamentally. The street will eventually price RDHL correctly, but it may or may not happen during Q3. If Opaganib can be successful by end of September, however, it will bring RDHL to media and street attention, thus expediting the process.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah, since I last looked, it has moved up a number of spots on the ETF list as far as % of the portfolio.
