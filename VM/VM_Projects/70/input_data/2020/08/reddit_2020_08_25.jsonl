{"title": "UNFI Update ‚Äì AMAZON/Whole Foods Grocery Supplier", "selftext": "[Update from my last post](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/icp9hp/unfi_amazons_grocery_supplier/)\n\n**FUCK ME**\n\nSince I bought in last Thursday the stock has dropped from $20.25 to $18.15. Amongst my ~2390 shares I‚Äôm down ~$5K. \n\nI‚Äôve bought in for a total of $11,101 in options, down $3,968 to date. \n\nHaven‚Äôt sold out yet, although I did move all my calls to Oct/Nov\n\nAll the research I have done could not point to a specific reason for this significant drop so I‚Äôve come to four possible reasons in what is impacting UNFI price (moreso then the rest of the industry):\n\n**1)**. [Grocery Bankruptcy‚Äôs announced](https://www.grocerydive.com/news/owner-of-kings-food-markets-and-balduccis-files-for-bankruptcy/584027/): In the backyard of UNFIs National Headquarters, East Coast Supermarket Chains Kings Food Markets and Balducci‚Äôs Food Lover‚Äôs Markets applied for bankruptcy on Monday. Now this should not affect UNFI, they stopped being distributor for these supermarket chains in 2018 ($30 million account that was taken by Kehe a smaller UNFI competitor). But because of the Grocery Bankruptcy‚Äôs that affected UNFI in Q1 (pre-covid) it wouldn‚Äôt take much to make people scared that more bankruptcy‚Äôs were around the corner. With that said after what occurred in Q1 UNFI did a deep dive in all its customer accounts to mitigate any change of this occurring again, at this point (per the last earnings call) this is not an outcome that is likely to occur. \n\n**2)**. [Short Volume](https://fintel.io/so/us/unfi): Has exploded in the last few weeks. Two week ago it was averaging 13-14%, last Friday it peaked at 25.77%. All of this means we have heavy short interest pressuring the price downward. With Institutions making up 84.41% of outstanding shares (45.1M of 53.4M) it is interesting to see if this means Institutions will agree with the short thesis and sell or buy up these shares at this discounted price potentially creating a squeeze. \n\n**3)** *No Pre-Earnings announcement*. Many of us had hoped, like they did for Q3, a month out from the earnings call they would be announcing how they did. Several people have contacted UNFI Investor Relations and their response is they intend on sharing nothing until the earnings call. Being the idiot that I am, my hope is the numbers are so damn good they are looking to fundamentally shift the prices on their shares to the low 30‚Äôs by releasing some amazing numbers. \n\n**4)**. I‚Äôm a fucking idiot, I mean I am one of you right?\n\nOverall none of this makes sense (welcome to the Stock Market) but if all establish Grocery Chains are reporting insane numbers, and UNFIs biggest customer is Amazon (who reported tripling online grocery sales) then I‚Äôll stick with my plan. \n\n**UNFI  - 2390 Shares, Call Options below**\n\n(8)\t  17.5C \t10/16\n\n(29) \t20C \t10/16\n\n(1) \t22.5C \t11/20\n\n(1)  \t30C  \t11/20", "id": "ighi28", "created_utc": 1598378693.0, "score": 17, "upvote_ratio": 0.76, "num_comments": 71, "comments": [{"body": "Stock only go up you dangus!", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "I'm not selling a thing because I think you are 100% right!", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "No you turd, stonks go up.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "It's super rare to find good followup my dude.
