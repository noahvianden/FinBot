{"title": "DD: Playing VXX and SPY against the Fed Repo Schedule (edited for mods)", "selftext": "EDIT: The results porn\nhttps://i.imgur.com/pREXtkP.jpg\n\n:***FYI this is an old post from earlier this week I kept updating.  I reposted it because I got a lot of pm's asking where it went after mods deleted because I used capital letters that were the same as banned stocks.***\n\n**\\*updates and edits below**\n\nThe “pump” is a real thing, and it’s something that the Fed is required to release information and a schedule on. It is done through a financial mechanism called a “Repo”—essentially a very short term (overnight to one month) loan given using safe securities, in this case treasury bonds, as collateral. The bottom line is it creates immediate liquidity and cash flow options for MMs, who then put it back into the market in the form of securities investment. Thus, the pump.\n\n[https://www.newyorkfed.org/aboutthefed/fedpoint/fed04.html](https://www.newyorkfed.org/aboutthefed/fedpoint/fed04.html)\n\nThe suspicious strength of the pumps led me to wonder how this was actually functioning and timed, and if It could help provide predictably during the current crazy market volatility. This is what I found.\n\nLet’s start with the positive performances of SPY over the past month and half.\n\nOn May 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th, SPY had a nice rally highlighted by a 1.6% jump on the 8th. After cooling off, on May 14th, 15th, and 18th it rallied up after a dip, with a notably strong jump of 3% (2.95) on May 18th. To close out May it hot up on the 26th and 27th, before one last jump on the 29th.\n\nIn June, SPY ripped on the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd, 4th, 9th, and 10th before the shitshow on the 11th. Huge bounce back on the 12th.\n\nIf you look at the corresponding Fed repo schedule ([https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/domestic-market-operations/monetary-policy-implementation/repo-reverse-repo-agreements/repurchase-agreement-operational-details](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/domestic-market-operations/monetary-policy-implementation/repo-reverse-repo-agreements/repurchase-agreement-operational-details)), you’ll see that the largest positive SPY increase days in May are correlated with the dates special dates where the Fed did two repo’s—the daily overnight AND an additional term repo (only one wasn’t noticeably large of an increase, but it was still an increase) but it was in the middle of a few day rally)\n\nPractically speaking that means each Tuesday of the next month should see an uptick in SPY since they are listed as the double dates.\n\nHow that plays out in this crazy, unsure week? I was going to be itching for Tuesday, disappointed that it’s the (seemingly) far date of the next dual repo (overnight and term loan). **but then I saw that the Friday the 12th we rally we just had fell on the day this month’s new Repo schedule took affect**. Then I looked back through the schedule for 6 months, and saw without fail the day the new repo schedule is released is a positive jump for SPY. In other words, the downward correction that was happening on Thursday June 11th was bailed out by a new Friday repo scheduling. What lucky timing for da bulls.\n\n**This time there is nothing to bail out the flash crash (unless we get an impromptu Donnie Pump going hard on vaccines) and tomorrow is a downswing.** **Load up on VXX 6/19 calls tomorrow, ride it through at least tomorrow though we will likely go down through Friday because there’s no repo excitement to lift the markets (no new schedule release and no dual repo operation until Tuesday).** **Pick up 6/26 SPY calls Friday EOD if you’re confident in a good weekend news cycle, but better would be Monday for the Tuesday dual-repo pump**\n\nAn interesting note is that they change the time of the operations in week or two week chunks throughout the month. Tin foil hat aside, I think this is done purposefully to create a sense of randomness in the pumps. You know how we always mention the two pm pump? They mix up the operation times after a bit so you don't play it like clockwork.\n\n**TLDR:** by VXX calls cuz we’re going down until Friday. Next week on Tuesday we have a sharp pop up so get SPY calls on Monday.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n*Updates and edits: From most recent to least:*\n\nUPDATE: 6/23/2020\n\nSPY up bigly in premarket.  Bane voice \"Yes.  A fire rises\"\n\nBut for real, there will be an opportunity before the late morning pump to sell off your profits, rebuy in \"on the dip\" as the kids says\n\nUPDATE:Gotta run for an hour but long story short if we hit 4.2% up im selling or if we slide to 2% down im selling.\n\nTaking advantage of the Pump: playing the Fed repo schedule for near-term tendies\n\nUPDATE: things are slowly starting to swing our way. J pow and his Number two are speaking over the next couple hours, I think 12 and 1. If VXX spikes don’t get greedy, we’d be lucky to have fought back today.\n\nParticularly don’t be greedy because the last thirty minutes or so of quad witching is extremely up and down. Have you ever lost and gained 40-80% in a 5 minute span before? It can happen during this time, and between RH outages, TDA always taking time to load the option spreads, and having to set differing prices on your limit order to sell, you can lose your gain in the time it takes you to figure out what you’re selling strike wise. I mean, play the 330 for sure, but be smart and if you see things riding in our favor rip the cord and take any profit instead of waiting for max profit. I went up from 9k to 20k TWICE last Friday and held out for end of day pump that didn’t come so I could get over the 25k day trading experience; so I’m not being a wet blanket, I’m telling you because I love you.\n\nThat said, if shit doesn’t break our way throughout the morning and somehow this melt up for VXX reverses, it won’t matter because you gonna cut your losses and go into 6/26 airlines and cruise lines for tendie Tuesday\n\nUPDATE: I will not lie to you. What lies in wait for us just beyond that opening bell looks frightening. Cold. Dark.\n\nEven red.\n\n**But, on the open, the stock for SPY is set to drop a predetermined $1.50 because it is ex-dividend day. This isn’t a theory, it’s a literal fact**\n\n[https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/091015/how-dividends-affect-stock-prices.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/091015/how-dividends-affect-stock-prices.asp)\n\n[https://sixfigureinvesting.com/2010/01/next-spy-ex-dividend-date-19-march-2010/](https://sixfigureinvesting.com/2010/01/next-spy-ex-dividend-date-19-march-2010/)\n\nI would say about 90% of retail invest in SPY do not know this. A) I believe apart of the overnight surge is also serious investors/ PPT pricing that in. B) Either way, I pray the sharp drop on open shakes the retail confidence and give us a space to sell if it’s bleak while recouping a little overnight loss, or fight a couple % up in the open if the ex dividend SPY decline is exacerbated by retail fear from lack of this knowledge, which is then exacerbated by the fact it’s quad witching.\n\nI’ll be honest though, this ‘buy the dip’ sentiment in retail could even be too strong, and they may just see the fucking decline as an opportunity. The retardation on this mentality has gotten out of hand and mad strong, but the winners write the history books, so I will save my bitter ‘Powell is mortgaging’ our future talk for another day.\n\nThen it’s in Fate’s hands. But I tell you what, brethren. These are the days stock fun are made of. Down 3 points. fourth quarter. On the ropes. Quad witching. Ex-dividend payout on the open. Confused masses. Bubble market. Low volume all week leading into today.\n\nIf shirts are lost today it will be done with excitement, honor, and in spite of ACTUAL DD.\n\n**Keeping my VXX held while I see how the morning plays out with my first time following ex-dividend movements with such vested interests**\n\n**If shit gets ugly even after the morning ex-dividend hit to SPY I’ll be parachuting into some 6/26 airline calls and SPY calls to ride the Tuesday double-pump bump**\n\nI’ll see you boys out there.\n\n**I try to get to all questions in comments pretty fast, cuz I love this shit, but if I miss something you're wondering that's time sensitive just pm me and I'll give you my opinion (which, to be clear, is NOT the opinion of a financial advisor or anything remotely close to one. be sure to do ya own research, and NEVER spend more than you can lose with a shrug and a laugh on trading--it's not worth it.)**\n\n**UPDATE: Halfway through, where this is going wrong wrong, where it went right, and where it can still go right** SPY spent the the vast majority of the day down, but only down from .1-.7 of a percent. VXX got IV crushed most of the day, without getting any big gains into green past the morning. I think the original theory held up in that SPY was looking to have a bad day--it didn't shoot up over for good until, SUSPICIOUSLY, 3:58 EST lol.\n\nTomorrow is quad witching day, and I'm gonna nerd out and do a bunch of research that gives me consolation and confirmation bias for my cursory which says its supposed to be a very volatile day traditonally. The volume was super low today, but I'm unsure whether that's because most people played the volatility that past Thursday, or if it's serious moves being made tomorrow.\n\nI fully welcome all critical insight, comments, or questions. I think we all need to keep learning and getting better instead of FOMOing into shit from the daily thread--that's not a way to spend your hard-earned Monday.\n\n***Either way I'm holding overnight, because truth and justice will prevail. Anyone else got brass balls too?***\n\n**UPDATE:** *This volume is insaaaaaanely low.* At one point a cruise line was trading more than SPY lol. I think either this means the afternoon session will be bigly volatile, and if it is I think it'll be volatile in a nice positive for VXX.  **If it stays quiet, I'm preparing for an AH/Pre-market dump and I'll be holding onto my VXX calls to play it out overnight.** May not be for everyone, but I'm confident in holding these. If anything I'm encouraged by the low volume, as big fish are sitting things out which leads me to believe they could be bracing for sharp movement, maybe cuz they're not getting their fucking free money tomorrow via term repo.\n\n**Also, does anyone know where we can get the nuts and bolts info on the corporate bond purchase agreement?**\n\n**UPDATE: VXX** has been resilient through several small SPY morning pumps as I suspected. This happened almost exactly the same times last Friday, but it had a very sharp afternoon increase. Because VXX has bounced back up, and looks to be trending that way, I will be staying firm with them through the day as I believe without the afternoon help of an additional repo boost the SPY selloff will continue.\n\n**EDIT:** there's a footnote I forgot because my handwriting is atrocious--for transparency sake 6/8 was the one day of the past like two months that didn't rise on a dual repo day, but it's was following two days where SPY surged over 6%, which made it an outlier.\n\n**UPDATE:** u/brucekeller pointed something interesting out I forgot I wanted to mention in here. The Friday June 12th term repo's were IOEM plus 0 basis points--in other words, on Friday the fed repos were free loans. That could've helped explain the size of the upward bounce back. It'll be interesting to see if this plays out practically, as the term repos for the remainder of this month's calendar are at 10 basis points, including the one coming this Thursday.\n\nI tried to find any consistencies between the maturity date of the loans and the action in the markets, but came up empty. My confirmation bias was sad, that would've been a cool find.\n\n**UPDATE:** overnight session was up and down but looks like VXX will kick things off by keeping it's part of the bargain on the open", "id": "hcdpox", "created_utc": 1592618453.0, "score": 81, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 73, "comments": [{"body": "Also, mate could you perhaps number your edits and updates cos right now it's looking a bit confusing, you have edits/updates at the top and at the end and also in the middle.\n\nCheers for the great work as always!", "score": 32, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah I realized that after I reposted it's a mess! next time im going to number and date the updates at the bottom. if you think that's bad you should see my handwriting lol", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "Maybe a time and date estimate for each update.
