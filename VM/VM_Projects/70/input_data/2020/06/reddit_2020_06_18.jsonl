You make make money by short positions (selling options) and you pay money to have long positions. To rephrase: Short positions give you a credit, and long positions require you to pay a debit. The closer an option is to the money, the higher the premiums you either pay or receive. If you write a short leg closer to the money, and a long leg further from the money, the credit you recieve from the short leg is bigger than the debit you pay for the long leg, aka a net credit. This is a credit spread. Flip the legs around and you get a debit spread. Credit spreads have opposite assumptions of what they're composed of, while debit spreads have the same assumption. Calls?
