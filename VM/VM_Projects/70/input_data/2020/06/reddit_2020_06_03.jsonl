{"title": "GNUS - Some Thoughts", "selftext": "With this company running up like crazy, I figured I would dig through some old news and financials to see what's going on. I'll preface this by saying that I have no position in this company, and I'm just throwing ideas out there in order to determine if people really believe in this company in the long-term, or alternatively are capitalizing on the short-term volatility. It seems pretty clear that the latter is true, but I'm bored at work and would like to hear some of your thoughts, so here it goes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Right now this company is trading at \\~$6.00 per share, with a market cap of \\~$590M or roughly 100x 2019 revenue of 5.9M. They have also never posted a profitable year.**\n\nThe historical financials are not looking good: [https://imgur.com/gallery/ef0uEV1](https://imgur.com/gallery/ef0uEV1).\n\nI dug through some old 10-K's and it looks like the elevated revenue in 2012/2013 (6.6 million and 2.6 million) was due to physical media sales such as DVDs in addition to physical products, think merchandise. Revenue then drops to 0.9M for several years until 2017 where they sold Llama Llama to Netflix for what I'm assuming was in the ballpark of $4M based on the huge bump, was too lazy to find the actual sale amount. Revenue drops back down in 2018, then bumps in 2019 due to the sale of Llama Llama season 2 and Rainbow Rangers Season 1, which was in the ballpark of $4M+ again.\n\nLooking down towards their bottom line, they've run up significant losses over the past 8 years, not posting a single profitable year in the time horizon I evaluated. **The 8 years of revenue totals $24.1M while the losses total -$55.7M.** This is concerning from a long-term viability standpoint as it seems Genius is unable to generate any money for shareholders. While they have created several very successful programs in recent years, it seems that they are unable to profitably deliver content. \n\nFinancials aside, I decided to look into this newly announced Kartoon Channel! to learn more about the actual product. I found YouTube channels for Kartoon Channel!, Kartoon Channel! Jr., Rainbow Rangers, and Llama Llama as I figured this would be a somewhat useful proxy for popularity and viewership. KC and RR videos averaged several thousand views per video while KC Jr and LL videos averaged in the low ten thousand views per video. Maybe GNUS is hoping to monetize on ads and turn a profit on that revenue stream, but given their current viewership (proxied from YouTube), it doesn't seem that they are going to generate much money. I'm also not very well versed in advertising revenue, so thoughts on this component from more experienced people would be great.\n\nI'd like some more information on the Kartoon Channel launch on June 15th, I can't tell if this will be a stand-alone streaming application, or simply a combination and rebranding of their existing content. Hoping that some of you who are smarter than me can dig into this and provide some clarity.

I don't have much knowledge of his work in the children's media market, but I'd guess Disney would have snatched this up if they believed it had big potential given his long-standing relationship with that company. That being said, I fail to see how that show can generate large sums of money for GNUS since it was co-produced with several studios and GNUS will have to share profits. Additionally, it seems like Amazon and Alibaba will be distributing the show, not GNUS. This helps GNUS (hypothetically) get more viewers, but also note that the shows will not be free, each episode is paid for, which might deter possible consumers.\n\nIf you find more details on the structure of the Stan Lee shows delivery and distribution, please comment it in.
