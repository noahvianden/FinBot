If you think from a return on capital employed perspective, I'd say DAL is at around 15% while AAL is only 10% (Operating profit pre interest & tax / assets - current liabilities). Again, looking at pre-COVID figures.\n\nIn addition, DAL has debt payment commitments beyond 2025+ whereas AAL will be struggling with significant principal payments in the next two years. This is of course on top of any government or COVID related borrowing.\n\nYou can also check credit ratings.\nhttps://www.fitchratings.com/research/corporate-finance/fitch-takes-rating-actions-on-north-american-airlines-10-04-2020", "score": 18, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Stocks go up?", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "AAL has an American flag on the plane and If you don’t stand for the flag on an airplane then what do you even stags fire?
