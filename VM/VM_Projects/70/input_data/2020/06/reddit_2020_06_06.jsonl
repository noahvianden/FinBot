{"title": "$CHWY Earnings Play, Week of June 8th", "selftext": "Chewy Inc. reports first quarter 2020 earnings this Tuesday June 9th after hours. To be honest this stock has been on an absolute tear this year, but I have reason to believe it will continue into earnings. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nCoronavirus has had a positive effect on pet adoption rates all over the country, and with boomers too scared to go to Petsmart they have been turning to Chewy to deliver their necessary pet supplies. Autoshipped pet food sales have gone up 45% in 2019 already, soon to be higher this year. Even if there is a nasty recession out there, you know who doesn't give a shit?.. Dogs! Dogs don't care if their owner is poor they still eat and need medical supplies. And for Americans pets are part of the family and spending less on ole Fido for a few months is out of the question. \n\nCheck out this story for more numbers:  [https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/06/03/whos-a-good-boy-chewey-wants-to-shake.aspx](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/06/03/whos-a-good-boy-chewey-wants-to-shake.aspx) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLast quarter they reported (-0.15) vs. (-0.17) and soared over 70% in the days after. The estimates for Q1 2020 are (-0.11), but give these new pet adoption and online shopping trends we should expect better numbers and possibly even A NET GAIN! If that happens, chewy shoots the moon my friends. \n\nChewy is no Uber or Lyft, they can ship to 80% of the US population overnight and 100% in two days. As sales increase they will reach economies of scale where costs per sale decrease. This would mean that costs actually go down as they take over the market and make even more profits. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you got FOMO from the earnings run up of SHOP or PTON, don't be a fool. Even if you don't believe me that they will post break-even or profits this quarter, then at least confront the fact that a loss of 0.11 per share is ridiculous.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: CHWY $60c 06/12", "id": "gxzofl", "created_utc": 1591479873.0, "score": 86, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 78, "comments": [{"body": "I held chwy calls last earnings.
