Considering that the main mechanism for QE transmission is via the bond market, it might make sense to compare equity valuations relative to bond yields. This changes the perspective completely and dramatically.\n\nThe chart below shows a classic proxy of the equity risk premium for S&P 500, calculated by subtracting the 10y bond yield from the earnings’ yield of the equity index - as a reminder, high means cheap in this case.\n\nThe chart shows that **compared to bonds, S&P 500 has seldom been cheaper**. As asset allocators consider their options, QE is twisting their arm to go heavier into equities.\n\n[A proxy of the forward Equity Risk Premium for SPX](https://preview.redd.it/3t3881y3pu651.png?width=2039&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7a3a4109c5cc20717abaf4a8e810a0cb064456b)\n\n**Massive short positioning in the market**\n\nThe other factor propelling the market higher is that everybody is short. If this feels counterintuitive, think about the fact that if speculative positions are very short it means that short sellers **have already sold** \\- and therefore their selling pressure is abating and **they might be forced to buy back their shorts** as the market works out this painful short squeeze.\n\n[SPX Net Positioning at historical lows](https://preview.redd.it/2hgzlye5pu651.png?width=2040&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4a491844d86861a6c9b0a56eb0b81c5e351ae91)\n\n**Economic damage is still there**\n\nIt is quite common for markets to retrace after a >3 standard deviation events. This happens during bull markets and recessionary periods.\n\nThe deciding factor between these two world views will, inevitably, boil back to fundamentals. One lost quarter to the global economy will mean defaults and unemployment, dampening both demand and investments\n\n[ISM New orders as deep as during the 2008 crisis](https://preview.redd.it/q723nus6pu651.png?width=2038&format=png&auto=webp&s=6dd7c67e2d48c360cb49121b935a0a30cd9139a3)\n\n**Conclusions - factors to track relevant if you stay long (or go short)**\n\nTo stay long in the market, we’ll want to monitor three factors (and the reverse applies for going short):\n\n1. **A recovery in macro data proxied by the ISM New Orders**\n2. **No sudden drop in volatilities, signaling complancency**\n3. **No excessive long futures positioning**\n\nMarkets might stay irrational for longer than traders can stay solvent, as the old adage says... or in the words of Jim Cramer:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2oi6fz88pu651.png?width=1674&format=png&auto=webp&s=4a4bcb9bbdc15c64dce1a3cd9b834ae9ef190727\n\n**What nobody is talking about**\n\nMeanwhile, the popularity of one of the most pro-market Presidents in history is falling in the middle of riots and pandemics. November is very far away and like many others we consider the re-election of Trump a fait-accompli’ ... yet if the numbers keep diverging markets might begin to become nervous about it.\n\n[Source FiveThirtyEight](https://preview.redd.it/0gyt14h9pu651.png?width=1563&format=png&auto=webp&s=5fb7ab76fb67a4f955eedb2a6526197727437d1c)", "id": "hf05l9", "created_utc": 1593001749.0, "score": 91, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 79, "comments": [{"body": "I have no clue how people focus long enough to put together such a coherent string of words.
