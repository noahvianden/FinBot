Porsche actually made more money trading that year than selling cars! If you want to pass this message on to other retail, you can because it can be engineered if all/large majority of retail work together as a whole to replicate what Porsche did. It must be done on a heavily shorted stock, like airlines and of course Porsche knew that. \n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.ft.com/content/0a58b63a-4294-3e07-8390-c3aabef39a26\n\nIt's a simple idea and Porsche did it perfectly. They basically bought enough shares and said they would not sell any shares. The majority of the rest of the shares was held by the government fund Lower Saxony, who would also not sell. So there was very little shares held by people who were willing to sell. The entire short float was larger than the rest of the available shares that could be sold. This also happened during the 2008 Financial Crisis (parallels to now) where a lot of people wanted to short.\n\nAnd hence Porsche engineered their squeeze. Bought most of the remaining shares and a ton of upside call options. Announced to the world they would not sell their shares. The bought call options caused market makers to have to buy some shares to drive the price up a bit. Once the price goes up a bit, the shorts have to cover. So some shorts started to cover. However, there now existed like almost no available shares that could be bought since both Porsche and Lower Saxony refused to sell. That caused a desperation short squeeze in which shorts after shorts covered on top of each other to make Volkswagen the most valuable company in the world at one point. You can look at the chart on Google images, but keep in mind that one doesn't even show you the intraday spike in super detail since it was so quick. It's called the infinity squeeze and it was done on a car company that had a lot of shares too, so it wasn't some low float company. \n\nCan retail do this? Yea they can. But the issue is mostly everyone has to coordinate perfectly. No one can sell their AAL shares. Everyone has to keep buying upside AAL calls. And you can cause this type of infinity squeeze. Essentially the combination of all retail has to behave the way Porsche behaved. Wsb is large for retail, but it's not enough to encompass all the retail, so it's not entirely realistic. Also Porsche didn't even get in trouble. They did nothing wrong, as all they did was buy shares, refused to sell, and buy call options, all three of which are perfectly legal. It was the short sellers who screwed themselved over.
