For the latest months data (May) there were over 3 MILLION background checks run. It’s not a direct comparable but this loosely means there were roughly 3 million firearms transaction in that month. Third highest ever recorded (March 2020 and December 2015 were higher). The clear trend is that these purchases are only increasing over the short term.\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/CWCfQB5.gif](https://i.imgur.com/CWCfQB5.gif)\n\nSource: [FBI NICS records](https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/nics_firearm_checks_-_month_year.pdf/view)\n\nThe FBI has provided a handy ‘Top 10” list and half of ‘highest days” and ‘highest weeks’ on record happened in 2020. Likely you’ll see a few more 2020 on that list by the end of the year.\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/cAslVO0.png](https://i.imgur.com/cAslVO0.png)\n\n**Election Years**\n\nCommon fact that election years always see a spike in gun sales as the NRA and Republicans always fear monger their base into thinking the next Democrat is going to take away all of their freedoms and surprise it works. Gun sales are again spiking in 2020.\n\nWhy was this election years panic buying delayed compared to 2016?\n\nIn 2016 no one thought Trump was going to win and Hillary aka satan was going to take everyones guns away so people started buying earlier since the “writing was on the wall”. But whoopsies CNN and MSNBC got it wrong and guns were safe for another 4 years and sales declined.\n\nIn 2020 the polls and ‘experts’ assumed Trump basically had his reelection in the bag given how the economy was harder than a teenager on Viagra and was his to lose… and he lost it. COVID-19 tanking the economy with record unemployment and his attacks on protestors, stupid shit posted on twitter, all while threatening to deploy the US military has given Sleepy Joe a 10 point average lead in the polls by doing nothing but hide in his basement. So now everyone that thought their guns were safe are once again panic buying in earnest.\n\n2020 is a bit different than years past in that Gun Control is a major part of the democratic policy platform that they are campaigning on. Francis O’Rouke in the primaries only had one policy that he was campaigning on and that was gun control with his famous [\"Hell, yes, we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.\"](https://www.npr.org/2019/09/12/760386808/orourke-promises-to-take-your-ar-15-but-americans-are-split-on-buybacks)\n\nGuess who Joe Biden picked to lead his gun control initiative? It rhymes with ‘Pork’. Here’s a few tid bits from [Sleepy Joe’s gun control platform](https://joebiden.com/gunsafety/)\n\n· Ban the manufacture and sale of assault weapons and high-capacity magazines\n\n· Regulate possession of existing assault weapons under the National Firearms Act\n\n· Buy back the assault weapons and high-capacity magazines\n\n· Reduce stockpiling of weapons\n\n**How does an anti-gun presidential candidate help sell guns?**\n\nThe greatest gun salesman in American history was good ole [Barrack Hussein Obama](https://ammo.com/articles/obama-greatest-gun-salesman-in-america-infographic) and all he ever did was issue press conferences and talk a big talk but never actually did anything. Fun Fact: Donald Trump has issued more gun control edicts than Obamas entire presidency, but facts don’t matter, only perception does. People actually believe that the string pullers behind Joe Biden will go hard on gun control (but the NRA says that every election).\n\nBasically, I’m saying there is a high probability that if Joe Biden wins the election he’ll replace Obama as the greatest firearms salesman of all time and there will be a whole lot of gun buying leading up to that.\n\nAlright you’ve convinced me the world sucks and people are scared and buying lots of guns.\n\n**How do you play this?**\n\nNot to many names to choose from but we have 2 publicly traded companies that sell guns directly to the public and both have seen some big short term rallies, but there’s a lot of juice left in these names and the election is only going to create more gun & ammo buying. Both these names haven’t hit their 2016 peaks (last presidential election) and I think there’s enough other shit going on to help these names surpass those 2016 peaks due to new gun buyers (not seen in 2016) and panic buying because protests, rioters, and cops being terrible in additional to the normal and expected right wing buyers every election year. If we use 2016 as an example we see a trend upward as buying intensifies and then with the surprise Trump win a massive drop and then a continued trend down through his presidency as people stop panic buying.\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/EuOdsD3.png](https://i.imgur.com/EuOdsD3.png)\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/b5lMPPu.png](https://i.imgur.com/b5lMPPu.png)\n\nHere’s what I’ve done with the expectation that I’ll be buying more as the election cycle heats up.\n\n**TLDR; Gun play SWBI 7/17 22.5c and RGR 7/17 80c if you have balls of steel oryou can go longer dated and holding through the election.**\n\n**Thanks for the tip asshole these names have already stonked…**\n\nLogic dictates that if you buy a gun you’ll buy ammo next. On top of that the panic buying of ammo goes hand in hand with the panic buying of guns. The hoarding of ammo is part of the American dream. The popular .223 and 5.56 rifle round has doubled in price since the end of 2019. The little 22lr has tripled in price.\n\nAmmo.com did a special news update that ammo sales are through the roof from COVID. [Directly from their site](https://ammo.com/coronavirus-impact-on-ammunition-sales)\n\n· 602% increase in revenue\n\n· 511% increase in transactions\n\n· 242% increase in site traffic\n\n· 84% increase in conversion rate\n\n· 16% increase in average order value\n\nWe’re seeing the news report on this all over the country and this trend will only continue as we ramp up into election season. Couple examples.\n\n['Ammo is really a scarcity:' Iowa gun stores feel effects of coronavirus hoarding](https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/2020/03/18/iowa-gun-stores-feel-effects-coronavirus-hoarding/5060889002/)\n\n[Panic At The Gun Shop](https://www.forbes.com/sites/halahtouryalai/2020/03/24/panic-at-the-gun-shop-coronavirus-fears-cause-a-run-on-ammo-and-firearms/#69d19fa8782e)\n\n[Floridians stockpiling guns and ammo amid national crises](https://www.wctv.tv/content/news/Floridians-stockpiling-guns-and-ammo-amid-national-crises-570992951.html)\n\nYou can bet all the major ammo suppliers are operating at full capacity to try and meet this new found demand. Federal Premium Ammo posted on facebook a pic of their president in the shop loading ammo into boxes. Obviously a PR stunt but point being demand for ammo is up.\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/BcvLnIU.png](https://i.imgur.com/BcvLnIU.png)\n\nThe two biggest retail ammo manufacturers in the country are Federal Premium and Winchester owned by Vista Outdoor (VSTO) and Olin (OLN) respectively. Both of these names haven’t stonked like the others and will likely see uplift from ammo sales but there’s a catch. Winchester Ammo segment for OLN represents 10-15% of EBITDA for the company so even if ammo sales is through the roof the rest of the business may choke on COVIDS donkey dong tempering said uplift from ammo sales.\n\nVSTO has higher exposure in that Federal Ammo represents 2/3rds of their sales but the other 1/3rd of the business is golf, camping, and camelbak gear that no one gave a shit about during COVID but could potentially see a resurgence in demand with lockdowns being lifted across the country.\n\n**TLDR; Ammo Play is VSTO 11/20 15c and if you understand chemical jargon that I don’t OLN 8/21 15c**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\\*\\*\\*EDIT\\*\\*\\* 6/21/2020 Update**\n\nTime for the follow up.  If you bought at the time of this post all names are up with the clear winners being RGR and VSTO.  OLN has been a kangeroo all week but I gave no promises on this one considering 70% of its EBITDA is tied to the energy sector which has more ups and downs than a bipolar teenager.\n\nI was disappointed with the markets response to SWBI's earnings report out after thursday's close which the market met with a collective \"meh\" with the name trading off from its pre-earnings release run up.  The gun segment of SWBI beat even the highest inflated expectations of the street but it seems this was lost on the $90 million write off for the non firearms business that is being spun out in August.  Management was very instructive highlighting that this buying spree is different as it includes lots of new gun owners with the expectation that some percentage of these new buyers will continue in shooting sports.  Take away is that gun demand is only going to increase in 2020 with most likely a cool off in demand in 2021.  The 4 analysts that cover the name upped their price targets with the average being $22.50.\n\nHindsight is always 20/20 but if I could play SWBI again I would have bought the same 7/17 22.5c on Monday and then on Thursday you could have sold a 7/17 25c for more than what you'd paid for Mondays 7/17/ 22.5c locking in a 10% profit and essentially keeping a free call option through the earnings report.\n\nRGR and VSTO were pure money ending the week up despite the broader market kangeroo court.\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "h9j5uj", "created_utc": 1592237081.0, "score": 85, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 70, "comments": [{"body": "Schools reopening soon?\n\nAverage person: economy looks like it's re-covering.\n\nWSB: let's  buy calls on guns.", "score": 140, "replies": [{"body": "If you care for your children’s safety you’d buy them an AR-15 for recess and Glock 19 for the classroom.
