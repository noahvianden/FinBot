This is the time where, if you sell, people in the future will wonder after you leave the room \"he got rich selling WHAT for WHAT valuation?\"\n\nLet's get into the technicals:\n\nMuch has been written, mostly wrong.   Tesla is the product of (i) massive leveraged bets, many by retail, (ii) gamma squeeze (the SIGs and other market makers of the world had never seen gamma move so quickly on newsless days and weren't ready for it to some extent) and (iii) up until $1,500 pre split, a massive short interest.  It was a perfect storm.\n\nNow, boatloads of the shares are in the hands of leveraged retail.  But it's not any leveraged retail.It's options, where the buyer has to affirmatively keep buying to keep the leverage on.  (to use my SIG example before, I believe they own 7% of the company's shares, all as Delta hedges to massively in-the-money options).\n\nThe leveraged buyers are no longer rolling forward their options if you look at the interest week over week.  Every week the long interest deep in the money and near the money is going down.  The leveraged buyers (again mostly retail) certainly aren't buying the shares held by the market makers.  They'll be dumped on the market over the next few months.\n\nThe S&P inclusion is important, but I've now read all of the S&P inclusion studies finding a short 5-10% bump.  It's based on arbitrage (buy at the announcement, sell when the funds buy).  In short, it's already happened.  None of the studies found a bump on the actual inclusion date.

If you can make more accurate predictions, you can fucking mint money. What if you could automatically know how much to price a airline ticket to sell out every single time, down to a penny. How about know exactly how many pairs of size 6 leggings you need to make this quarter down to within 0.25%. How about exactly what ads to show someone to maximize dollars spent on Instagram every year. This is what is happening billions times a day behind the scenes. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[C3.ai](https://C3.ai) brings the power that has brought AMZN, MSFT, GOOG, and FB to the rest of enterprise.

[C3.ai](https://C3.ai) helps companies implement AI into their business through their full featured platform. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen you are looking for good software you want to find something that is defensible / complex, yet easy to implement, and obviously valuable to the end user. The reason ServiceNow can charge JP Morgan 60 million dollars a year is because it saves them 500. For C3, deploying these models is easy because they have pre-builts that they can adapt to any business, a platform to run them on, is cloud agnostic, and the internal talent that even medium organizations wouldn't be able to find / use effectively. A single AI implementation can be worth 10s, 100s of millions of dollars to an organization, and you don't think they will be happy to pay [C3.ai](https://C3.ai) through the nose to maintain it? AI capability will be table stakes in 2 years, if it isn't already. This is a pure-play on that. Look at the post IPO pop.
