{"title": "The day of GME short squeeze", "selftext": "You wake up at 7AM in morning, you begin your day with a bowl of cereal made by $K, you go on chrome on your $GOOG smartphone, and right away it auto-fills [https://www.investing.com/equities/gamestop-corp](https://www.investing.com/equities/gamestop-corp) because Sundar Pichai knows you check that page every 5 seconds. It's still premarket, you know it doesn't mean shit most of the time but you do it every day anyway. Once again it's a -0.5% day.  You notice a hit piece from SeekingAlpha written by Mott Capital, you don't know what it's saying since you can't read, but somehow you know the author is a gay bear. Then you go on StockTwits, ShyGlizzy is \"shorting here\" again but you know learned to ignore all the bears. You hide your feeling of discomfort for now.\n\nIt's now been 3 days since you bought GME 40C, and every day you keep losing to theta gang. You bought at 300% IV and there's 2 days until expiration. You're staring at a 95% loss, and you're about to paperhand, but you don't because you know u/deepfuckingvalue is still fucking in at a gain of over 9 million. You unzip your pants and start jerking off to his gain porn. You start at 7:28 and finish just in time before the market opens.\n\nRobinhood crashes again and you can't log in, you start feeling a sense of panic rising through the depth of your innards. You take a double dose of Prozac and Xanax and from $PFE, you asked your doctor for this since you also have $PFE 60c expiring in 2 weeks. But it's not helping and you feel your hands turn into toilet paper.\n\nBut wait... what's going on ? $GME on investing.com is showing a price of $42.69?!?!? You think you're dreaming so you refresh... now it's $69... another 5 minutes... no updates. You go on r/wallstreetbets and you see the daily thread comment has over 30k comments. GME triggered circuit breaker and its stopped trading, and it's now mooning 100% every time it resumes trading\n\nYou notice your PP fully erect at over 3 inches, you haven't felt this way since you have ED from all the Prozac you've been taking ever since you started options trading. $GME is now over $9000 dollars per share, u/deepfuckingvalue is now banging McKenzie Scott (formerly known as McKenzie Bezos) and starts a hostile take over of $AMZN. While u/Sir_jack_a_lot  dies from a ruptured brain aneurysm due to hypertension from too many tendies.  The WSB collective now starts a hedge fund, creating $RTRD ETF comprised solely of GME and TSLA calls. Bears around the world are annihilated while shares of $KMB and $JNJ rallies over 30% on reports of a sudden increase in demand for kleenex and personal lubricants.\n\nand that was the greatest day of your life, and it's great because you didn't paperhand.\n\nThe end\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGME  🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀  🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀  🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀  🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀  🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀  🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀  🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀  🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀  🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀  🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀  🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀  🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀  🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀  🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀  🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 ", "id": "kjrd4v", "created_utc": 1608862670.0, "score": 472, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 77, "comments": [{"body": "You missed the part where Bank of America's trading desk gets blown up by GME and it starts a new global financial crisis, leading to GME shares forming the new global reserve currency, while an eagle named Ryan Cohen flies in through an open window and sheds a single tear", "score": 228, "replies": [{"body": "I'll jerk off to this tonight instead of midget porn", "score": 80, "replies": [{"body": "Why not both?", "score": 15, "replies": [{"body": "Split screens", "score": 10, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "You guys are very lucky that retard who sold Chewey for 1/10th of it's value is dumb enough to double down on G M E when it was free falling.", "score": -15, "replies": [{"body": "Lmao go cry into your mom’s dirty panties 🌈🐻", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "I would if she wore any...
