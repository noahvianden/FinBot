{"title": "Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, December 1, 2020", "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, December 1, 2020**\n\nStocks continued rising today, with each of the major indices hitting fresh intraday record, before selling off somewhat in the last hour of the market. Market participants are eager to extend gains after a historic November performance. The Dow posted its biggest monthly gain since January 1987 with an advance of nearly 11.9%. In the S&P 500, the energy, financials, and industrials sectors led the index‚Äôs 10.8% rise, as market participants rotated back into many of the names that had been beaten down the hardest earlier on during the pandemic in the wake of positive vaccine news.\n\nThe positive vaccine news led analysts to raise their predictions for 2021 after Pfizer (PFE), Moderna (MRNA), and AstraZeneca (AZN) each reported promising vaccine data in their clinical trial, raising hopes that an effective solution to the pandemic could roll out relatively soon. Fundstrat Managing Partner Tom Lee said in a note Monday he believed the S&P 500 would end 2020 at 3,800, implying another nearly 5% upside for the index. However, given the surge of coronavirus cases in the United States and Europe, Jerome Powell tempered optimism. He said, ‚ÄúRecent news on the vaccine front is very positive for the medium term. For now, significant challenges and uncertainties remain, including timing, production and distribution, and efficacy across different groups.\n\nAccording to Worldometer, as of Tuesday, there are 13,919,870 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the U.S. According to the same chart, 274,332 people have died from the virus in the U.S., and 8,222,879 have recovered so far. In the month of November alone, the US added more than 4 million cases, double the amount from October, according to the Johns Hopkins University. There were around 168,000 new cases reported Tuesday, with health officials expecting worse to come given the travel that took place during Thanksgiving in the US.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Zoom (ZM) reported way better-than-expected earnings but the market was not impressed, stock down more than 15% at the time of writing.\n   * EPS of $0.99 vs $0.75 estimate \n   * Revenue of $777.2 million vs. $694.5 million estimate. Revenue is up 366.5% on a year-over-year basis.\n* Zoom (ZM) rated by many reputable analysts as NEUTRAL or EQUAL-WEIGHT with price target very close to current levels. Seems analysts not expecting much from Zoom after earnings.\n* U.S. airlines could receive $17 billion for four months of payroll support under a new $908 billion bipartisan Senate COVID-19 relief proposal, a spokeswoman for Senator Mark Warner said Tuesday. We‚Äôll keep you posted if there are any developments.\n* Amazon (AMZN) is bringing its AWS cloud-services to the Macintosh operating system for the first time, allowing developers to create apps for iPhones, Macs, and other Apple (AAPL) devices\n* Bank of America has officially joined other U.S. banking majors in refusing to finance oil and gas exploration in the pristine section of Alaska that President Trump last month opened to drilling for the first time ever.\n* According to Adobe, Cyber Monday sales reached $10.84 billion, rising more than 15% year over year. That is at the low end of the 15% to 35% range the firm projected, but still makes it the largest online shopping day in U.S. history. Adobe now expects online sales to reach $184 billion for the holiday season as whole, down from a prior estimate of $189 billion.\n* The total monthly sum bet legally on sports in the US likely topped $3 billion for the first time in October, according to analysts at Benchmark, citing state-level data, a new record. We particularly like DraftKings (DKNG) in this space.\n* Kandi Technologies have been pulling back steeply after the publication of a negative report from Hindenburg Research, the same short seller that made allegations against Nikola in September. The company said it would investigate the allegations\n* GrowGeneration (GRWG) target raised by Lake Street Capital from $28 to $40 BUY. This is one we love and frequently post about!!\n* Starbucks (SBUX) target raised by Wells Fargo (WFC) from $100 to $113 OVERWEIGHT.\n* Square (SQ) target raise by Needham & Co. from $230 to $250 at BUY. Stock currently around $210s.\n* Li Auto (\n* LI) with huge target raise by Goldman Sachs (GS) from $20 to $60 at CONVICTION-BUY. Stock currently near $40, very bullish.\n* Moderna (MRNA) with huge target raise by Argus from $88 to $200 at BUY. Company recently filed its COVID-vaccine with the FDA\n* Micron Technology (MU) target raised by Keycorp from $70 to $74 at OVERWEIght. Stock currently around $65.\n\n\"You learn more from failure than success.

Yes, people waited in line at the launch, but by the end of the first year everyone who wanted a smartphone could buy an Apple iPhone, and as the % of the population who wanted a smartphone rapidly increased, Apple was able to scale their production to match the demand... there was never a point where a consumer comparing an iPhone against a competing smartphone was forced to choose the competing phone because the iPhone was unavailable.   \n\n\nCompare this with the automotive industry. Tesla is doing amazing work decreasing the cost in capital required to build a new EV factory, but there are still physical limitations to how quickly Tesla can build new factories. There are also limitations to how quickly Tesla can train employees at those factories, and how quickly Tesla can deliver and service vehicles they build. Meanwhile, the shift in consumer preference from ICE vehicles to EVs is continuing to occur rapidly, and even if Tesla were to announce another two tera-factories that are going to break ground in 2021, they still wont be able to keep pace with this shift! This means that for the foreseeable future, consumers who want an EV might recognize that a Tesla would be a better, lower cost, more reliable option, but still decide to buy a VW, Hyundai, Kia, or Rivian EV because their local dealership has those in stock, they need a car this month, and Tesla can't deliver to them until next quarter.   \n\n\nThe automotive industry is too big and building even a simple EV is so much more complex than building an iPhone... there will be room for more than one participant, even if the gap between first and second place is massive.
