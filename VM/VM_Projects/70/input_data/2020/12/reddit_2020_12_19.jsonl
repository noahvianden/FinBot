{"title": "If a stock mooned today, what stock is most likely to moon tomorrow? (Also known as a lead indicator) Analysis inside", "selftext": "(Repost.  mods please don't remove my post for no reason while you allow shit posts to stay)\n\nImagine you check stock prices one day and see the price of FedEx shares has increased by 10%. You probably would think there has been some positive event for delivery businesses and probably UPS would be the next to have a run. This is intuitive but may not always work. First, the two stocks may move simultaneously, so if you have missed one price action, you've missed the other as well. Second, in many cases, the other related stock(s) are not as obvious as the FedEx/UPS example.\n\nThis is the question I want to answer:\n\n**If a given stock had a sizeable move (arbitrarily defined by me as an increase of at least 5% from open to close) today, what stock is the most likely to have a sizeable increase tomorrow?**\n\n**Methodology** (skip if you don't know/care about statistics)\n\n* I focused only on the 100 most popular stocks listed on Robinhood from the beginning of the year 2020 till today. I can add more stocks later but this is the starting point.\n* Define daily return for each stock as r = (close - open)/open\\*100\n* Define excess return (er) for each stock by subtracting the S&P 500 (SPY) returns. So for example, if $AAPL went up by 10% and $SPY went up by 3%, the excess return for AAPL is 7%.\n* Define a mooning event as an excess daily return of at least 5%.  If er >= 5, moon = 1. Otherwise moon = 0.\n* I limit the analysis to stocks that had at least 5 mooning events.\n* For each stock, I regress the moon variable on the 1-day-lagged moon variable of every other stock, one by one, and pick the one with the greatest statistical significance.\n\n**Results**\n\nThis is how you read the results table.\n\n* Today: the stock that mooned in a given day.\n* Tomorrow: the stock that's most likely to moon the next day\n* T-stat: how reliable the prediction is (the larger, the better)\n* Probability: the probability of the other stock mooning (based on previous patterns)\n\nFor the stocks that don't appear in the Today column, it means they are not lead indicators for any other stock in the sample.\n\nSorry for using a screenshot. If I use text, the bots think I'm spamming with lots of tickers. But I posted [the table on GitHub](https://github.com/maxfort86/wsb/blob/main/results.csv) as well.

With more data I think you'll find these will all fall away. For starters try 5yrs of data and Russell 1000 stocks. I expect most if not all will fall away.\n\nWhich flows into significance. It would be great if the T-stat (or something else) told us **how** good the prediction was. As it stands, us retards are left trying to interpret the stat on our own. Also I don't think a T-stat is relevant for how few observations you have and the fact that equity returns are leptokurtic (fat tails rather than normal dist.)?\n\nIt might be interesting to include big price falls as well so that you can inform a short strategy (or if something falls >5% one day maybe something else rises >5% the next day).\n\nCould be interesting/easier to see what cross-sector effects there are. If Healthcare moons/tanks one day does that mean Industrials moons/tanks the next? Upside being you only need to track a few 'stocks' (use indices or sector ETFs) so could do a longer time series. You're using R though so I figure amount of data isn't a problem.\n\nLast suggestion would be on returns and how/whether you include overnight moves. As it stands you're not, but maybe it would be beneficial. If TSLA opens up 20% 'cos Daddy Musk got high and took a literal shit on his neighbor's Volt and then stays flat your equation says it didn't moon but really it did.

However really interesting way to test out a theory. \n\nA few suggestions. The regression you’re showing looks like there’s not a huge correlation past those based on T-1 returns alone; since the retail memes this year tend to be episodic and take a few days/weeks to play out, maybe do a T-5, T-10 or other timescale regression? IE if stock X moons today given stocks that mooned in the last y weeks, what are the odds next week Z moons? Mooning isn’t necessarily a daily occurrence. \n\nAlso, maybe do a sentiment scrape (literally of r/wallstreetbets) to see if that improves any of the findings and correlation? You might find that particularly since the sub is representative of a nontrivial quantity of retard retail option pumpers, there is some leading effect.
