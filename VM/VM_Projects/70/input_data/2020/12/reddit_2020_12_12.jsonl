{"title": "NIO", "selftext": "We saw NIO hit an all time high in the high 58s before coming crashing down to close at $41 today. What happened?\n\n🌈 🐻 Andrew Left of Citron broke momentum by posting a price target of $25 for NIO. This was the first big event that caused NIO to plummet, although it did rebound, but many retail and boomer investors were scared off.\n\nThen the House passed the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act. This bill delists foreign stocks that don’t uphold the standard American GAAP American accounting standard. This brought Chinese stocks and NIO under $50 for the first time in weeks. This is super irrational as NIO has been compliant ever since the Senate passed this bill months ago (they even use the same auditer that Tesla uses).\n\nAt this point, NIO is being way undervalued and the selloffs were caused by really irrational things and NIO should be a buy already.\n\nAll looked well and NIO was consolidating at $45-$47 before two days ago. Then NIO announced a $2B stock issuing (which only diluted shares by 5%) and everyone freaked out and paper handed till NIO sits at the $41 it is sitting at right now.\n\nWell what will this $2B be used for. Rumor has it that NIO will be using it to expand in foreign markets soon and building infrastructure in Europe, etc. 😳 if this turns out to be true this could be a huge catalyst for another NIO rally.\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/cntechpost.com/2020/12/12/nio-is-closer-to-entering-overseas-markets/amp/\n\nOther potential causes for a major NIO rally include NIO Day on 1/4 (think of Tesla Battery Day but chinese) 🚀\nAnd the fact that NIO is showing a pennant forming right now. Don’t want to link an Imgur, but trust me. It sold off a couple times and is consolidating rn, prime for a breakout. Breakout could happen by end of next week according to my calculations.\n\nNIO is at a deep discount right now, levels we haven’t seen since early November so be prepared for a major moon soon\n\nPositions:\n110 NIO shares, \n$69 1/2021 NIO calls", "id": "kbl2ng", "created_utc": 1607758431.0, "score": 113, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 79, "comments": [{"body": "NIO to 46-50 EOY!!! 🚀", "score": 43, "replies": [{"body": "Moar", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "I'd welcome more. 🚀🚀\nHonestly we here autists could make whatever we want happen if we worked together by \"accident\"", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "NIO is a well respected meme stonk.
