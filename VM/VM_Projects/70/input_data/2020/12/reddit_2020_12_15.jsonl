Is this supposed to mean that Amazon is considering the acquisition of Shopify?\n\nShopify has certainly found great success, but I don't know how this acquisition would reconcile with Amazon's core strategy.  Amazon has made it easy for small vendors to get listings on Amazon's web site.  The Amazon site will let you browse a single vendor's \"shop\" but the web site is clearly branded Amazon, any purchases go to an Amazon cart.  Shopify provides an independent interface for each vendor (independent carts), and also offers POS systems.  Maybe Amazon would like to get the Shopify POS, but I can only imagine they would want everything else to be integrated with the common Amazon site and its cart system.", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "Well I do know that Amazon just said the other day that they have talked about and considered launching a direct competitor to Shopify.\n\nThis makes sense because there is going to be A LOT of market share in this space to grab over the coming years and SHOP is well positioned to take it which could eventually impact amazon's bottom line more and more.\n\nOverall, I'm very bullish on SHOP and what they offer small businesses and entrepreneurs.\n\nEdit: I reread the original post now that I have had some coffee. It appears OP is saying that SHOP is in Amazons eye and they are likely to launch a competing product. I agree with this and it does make me hesitant about investing.
