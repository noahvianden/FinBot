{"title": "Giving this thread full control of my stock picks", "selftext": "Hi all, I decided to do something fun for 2021. I'm giving this thread full control of $1000 to see how it does. The rules\n\n- One stock ticker per parent level comment. Explanation is optional.\n\n- the number of upvotes a parent level comment gets will determine the weight of that stock.\n\n- Tickers with 1 or fewer upvotes will not be counted.\n\n- Tickers that receive multiple parent level comments will only have the comment with the highest number of upvotes counted.\n\n- No options trading\n\n- I won't buy fractional shares so no tickers over $1000 will be possible. Also, I will have to do some rounding when I make the actual purchase.\n\nI will make the buys on January 4th 2021 and maybe sell on January 5th 2022.\n\nI'd appreciate it if you all tried to make me some money and steered away from meme stocks but if not that's my problem, not yours. I'll make the decision of which stocks to buy when this thread dies down. Let the games begin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEDIT:\n\nIt's just before 5am the day after I started this thread and I decided to make some changes. I couldn't get close enough to the allocation you all voted for without fractional shares so I started an account with M1 finance and I will be using fractional shares via their pie feature. \n\nThe positions received 130 positive upvotes total but I couldn't find GIK on there for some reason so I'm leaving it out and doing math with 129 upvotes.\n\n28 msft\n7 sq\n38 pltr\n12 DIS\n7 nio\n8 aapl\n8 se\n7 plug\n6 crsr\n3 pins\n2 icln \n3 tdoc \n129total\n\nI divided each stocks number of upvotes by 129 and then rounded to get a percentage. I had two percentages left over which I put into MSFT and PLTR as they are the largest positions. I will purchase into this pie with $1000 on January 4th.", "id": "kitgy2", "created_utc": 1608731609.0, "score": 8, "upvote_ratio": 0.65, "num_comments": 72, "comments": [{"body": "NIO", "score": 10, "replies": []}, {"body": "SQ", "score": 14, "replies": []}, {"body": "MSFT", "score": 34, "replies": []}, {"body": "NIO", "score": 12, "replies": []}, {"body": "PLTR", "score": 44, "replies": []}, {"body": "DIS", "score": 18, "replies": [{"body": "Why dis?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Due to Covid the P/E plummeted.
