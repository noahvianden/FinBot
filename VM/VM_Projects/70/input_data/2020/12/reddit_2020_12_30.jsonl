{"title": "122% GME Shares Held By Institutions. WTF & Does It Matter? 🚀🚀🚀", "selftext": "[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/holders?p=GME](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/holders?p=GME) I know this is not the most complete or accurate data, but I think it's solid enough to make a point and ask a question.  \n\n\nu/ahminus confirmed to me that, after each short position, there must inevitably be a new long position, because somebody bought the shorted share. And that makes sense, after all. If we simplify things by saying that 100% of outstanding shares have been shorted, that means we have roughly 200% long positions for GME, compared to outstanding shares. Add that to the list of ridiculous things about this stock...\n\nIf I'm interpreting this in a retarded, incorrect way, teach me the right way, because we're here to know... the way.\n\nAnyway, if only 122% of those 200% long positions are held by institutions, that's basically 61%. Compared to Best Buy for example [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BBY/holders?p=BBY](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BBY/holders?p=BBY)  \nor Target [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TGT/holders?p=TGT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TGT/holders?p=TGT) we're still a long ways off. I know, not the most relevant examples, but gaybears often cite those 2 companies as better places to go and buy gaming shit, so I figured why not compare them in this regard too.\n\nObviously, we could include Cohen's 13% into this calculation, even though he's technically an Insider. That does brings us a bit closer to the 2 examples above.\n\nEither way, this begs the question. ***Ignoring all the other factors for the moment (I know, hard to ignore that 100% short interest...) how much more juice do we have left in this engine if this stock achieves, umm... respectable, 'established' percentage of institutional ownership?!***\n\nBecause, we all know, deep in our hearts, that despite all our efforts and meme energy, we don't have enough buying power to keep pumping the stock price up for the next 3-9 months. It is these multi-hundred-billion $$$ tutes that move the needle, as always.\n\nPOSITION: europoor 231 shares @ $15.41.
