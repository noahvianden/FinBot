If it did, you would never see options writers selling SPY calls 10% OTM with an IV of 20% or 30% because it would guarantee they would loose money if the price swung by 20-30%. Also, how many times has an option with an IV of 400% actually gone up 400%? Often times, once a stock has ran enough to have an IV of 400%, it suddenly reverses and falls back to earth.\n\nWhat IV measures is the psychological prediction that a stock will move in price, which IV then tries to quantify as a magnitude of anticipated change. In reality, what you are seeing is supply and demand for an option. The common story goes like this: as a stock gets really \"hot\" and starts to increase in price rapidly, people are \"sure\" it will keep rising, and thus are willing to pay more for the same call contract (increase in demand), thus creating and \"implied\" volatility, or implication/assumption the stock will continue to increase on it's same trajectory. As the stock price falls over a few days, IV starts to come down for the calls. You can also get huge IV spikes as people place their bets on say the outcome of a clinical trail, and the demand for options surges without the actual price of the stock moving that much (CRBP did this over the summer).  IV is not a hard and fast, easy to quantify metric, but rather a result of the emotion involved in an increasing demand for a limited supply. \n\nI write a lot of options, and I think of it as a FOMO measurement more than anything else. By the time a stock hits an IV in the high 200s or 300s, usually meaning the stock price has already ran that much too, it is an absolute fallacy to think it will run this much again, and yet this is exactly what people think and they are willing to pay the money even though the option contract is now priced to account for this.

It is the value (of sigma) that can be plugged into the Black-Scholes formula that gives an option price equal to what is being traded in the market.  So you can look at IV as the same thing as the option price, just with different units.  IV has nothing to do with the volatility of the option price.\n\nAlso, the reason IV can be over 100% is that the (natural) **log returns** of the stock price are assumed to be normally distributed according to BS.  The standard deviation of log returns can be arbitrarily high.\n\nSay we have a log return of -10 (this might equate to an IV of roughly 1000%) on a stock that was trading at $100. The new price after applying this log return would be $100e^(-10), or $0.00454 (pretty much zero).\n\nLog returns are pretty close to simple returns when you look at small movements (kind of like sin(theta) = theta using the small angle approximation in physics). But when movements get large, things diverge.\n\nLike if you do 100e^(10) for the positive movement of the prior example, that would be a stock price of $2,202,647. Obviously an actual return of 1000% would just be a 10x return, which is a stock price of $1100.  If you take 1% simple/log returns, the values are much closer. Stock price with a 1% log return = $101.005, and with a 1% simple return = $101.\n\nSo, I think these kinds of 'back of the napkin' calculations for probability/price movement break down when numbers get crazy, unless I'm missing something.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah, this is pretty much correct. \n\nInteresting that this has two points (one of which is mine) when the reply at the top, which dismisses an entire core of theory common to options pricing, has more than 60.\n\nAnd as I say in my own comment elsewhere, an annualized minus 110% log rate of return would price a $100 stock at $33.29.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah, now that I've gone and read it, that is interesting.

A great example is earnings. IV is higher for expirations around earnings because there is a lot of uncertainty around the event.\n\nAs for different IVs across strikes: the easiest way to understand it is simply that the BS model does not accurately describe reality. If we lived in a Black-Scholes world, IV would be the same across different strikes, and the standard deviation of log returns would always be the same.  In reality volatility always changes, which is why there are more complex 'stochastic volatility' models (like the Heston model) that try to take this into account.\n\n>Does this suggest that markets think that TSLA will move with a 68% degree of probability, 110% up or down within 12 months?\n\nWithout diving into the math, I think the only valid statement that can be made from glancing at an IV of 110% is that the options market is expecting a ton of volatility.  A 110% annualized volatility equates to roughly a 7% daily volatility.\n\n>Is there a relationship of HV and IV?\n\nNo, at least not on any theoretical basis.  IV is usually higher than what the realized volatility turns out to be. So I guess that's a relationship. And I think it's possible that there might be some correlations/relationships that appear if you looked at enough historical realized/implied volatility data.

But I suppose some people might want a cheaper call premium play, with less news and shit, and most you fucking idiots need all the help you can get. \n\nBBY is another strong options play, I’ll be looking to purchase early next week based on futures and overall market sentiment. But another drop today closed the deal for me. Sticking with ATM calls due to low cost, and we could definitely fall into the 95 range briefly. \n\nWeekly puts are incredibly cheap, consider mildly protecting your call position over the next two weeks if investing significant equity (sell them fast though!). But this decline is undoubtedly near an end and this bitch is turning around shortly for a couple of reasons. \nDon’t get too technical about the purchase point, current market value is solid as it is. \n\nFirst off I don’t like this company in terms of a long term prospect, given the Covid sales bump combined with the vaccine news, but cases are worse then they’ve ever been. Essentially a 9/11 every couple of days.. So that’s good for this one I guess... but as I will probably explain every time, when I give these alerts I’m telling you the price will move upwards enough within the expiration date to exceed theta, but I don’t provide sell points. \n\nFirst thing first, the boys at Best Buy are doing a good old fashioned buyback this quarter, so that helps make things guaranteed. We are down well below short moving averages and at our five year moving averages for those of you that give a shit. \n\nThe company has been performing exceptionally during quarantine and has a strong bottom line (Yes I know it went down a bit due to logistical costs of online sales). We will definitely see some positive growth over the next month or two, and it’s another clear example of a stock that is being majorly oversold post earnings. \n\nIf you start typing under the impression I think BBY is going to fly to 125 in two weeks you’re a fucking idiot. Don’t bag hold dumb fucks, especially if you buy OTM calls. \n\nDon’t think writing puts is an awful strategy on this one either, but think CRM is still better, and you can soak up way more premium with its current IV and volume.", "id": "k6yu14", "created_utc": 1607133719.0, "score": 66, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 72, "comments": [{"body": "I like this you little fucker", "score": 15, "replies": []}, {"body": "We’re you my CRM 250c whisper?

Trying to learn from my fellow autists.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Of course! Think of volume as the number of contracts traded that particular day. If an option has a volume of 100 and you buy 50 contracts, you just traded half that option’s volume, if you want to get out of that trade quick there will be less people around to buy it from you, as not many other people are trading that particular option (Keep in mind this is always changing). The higher the volume means more people and means you have a better chance to get in and out of a trade and the better the chance you will pay less to get in and get out of that trade. \n\n\nWhy does this matter? The lower the volume means there are not as many people trading that option that you are interested in- which means it is a more dangerous position to enter and you may get stuck in that position, and if there is a buyer when you want to sell that position and realize profit, the more likely you will be giving more of that potential profit trying to meet that buyer (bidder) in the middle to get out. \n\n\n\nWhen there is large volume on an option it means that many people are trading that option and they are constantly changing hands and that tightens (lowers) the difference between what people are asking for that option (seller) and what people are bidding for that option (buyer). Usually the rule of thumb is to get in/out of trade faster, you will need to buy at the ask and sell at the bid. So if the bid ask spread is wide and you buy 100 contracts you’ll be paying potentially a bunch to get in and out of a trade. \n\n\n\nI refuse to touch any low volume options unless I’m super confident or it moved so much that I know I can most likely still profit even with a wide bid ask spread. I prefer high volume (The higher the better), and high OI (Open interest, or number of contracts that currently exist on that day) and a max bid ask spread of one cent (One dollar per contract).\n\n\nI always set the limit order a few cents below the bid after an already big defined movement and wait to see if it’ll move more and trigger it/ get filled first before setting limit order at the bid. No need to pay more when most times you don’t need to. Of course there are times you’ll try going at the bid and then it reverses completely and you wish you bought at the ask and didn’t try to save pennies. \n\n\nI mostly scalp weekly options though and have a set few stocks in which I watch the contracts movement all day for good opportunities where the contract jumps a bunch a certain way, and then try and catch it when it reverses. So for me low bid ask spread is crucial because if I’m buying 100 contracts I want to pay the least amount to get in and get out. Find what is right for you though! Hope this helped, feel free to DM with any further questions.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Awesome response! Thank you. Makes complete sense. So with that being said why did you mention you wanted to go for the 110c 12/11 expiration play but in the same breath mention you didn’t like the volume? Based on the above wouldn’t you prefer to shy away if there’s less volume(for the reasons above)?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I agree with the sentiment of OP that this could be a nice position. I chose 110c 12/11 personally because it has the most volume compared to the more ITM strikes on the weeklies. I meant when I said I didn’t like the volume that I didn’t like the the low volume and wide bid ask spread on the one OP suggested, even though it was safer as it has more time and is ITM. The 110c 12/11 has a volume of 945 and OI of 772 Compared to OP’s 105 12/22/21 volume of 58 and OI of 28. Albeit that 945 volume is a little low for me, I’m taking the risk as my position sizing won’t be that big.

They will continue to inflate asset prices and devalue the dollar so I can understand! If we get stimulus agreed upon before the deadline, even better :) and I’m only anticipating it coming up a little bit to be honest, my usual habit is jumping on red days on open, when it goes down enough to where I think it’ll rebound, even a little, I’ll grab a few contracts and then sell when it rebounds closer to the previous close line. Have had good luck with Apple and other popular stocks on this as people will usually always buy the dip in the mornings where it comes down a little bit. If it keeps going against it I’ll wait until I’m down and then depending how I feel I will sell at a loss or average down to current contract price, it usually reverses enough to get out ahead unless just timed completely wrong (which happens too), BBY closed Friday at $105.57 and the contracts were $47. Friday morning when BBY was $106.45 those contracts were $87. If BBY goes above 106.00 I’ll be in a good position. May sell half or may risk it and let it ride more if I’m up. But will hold and then sell if it comes back down my average so I’m not out anything. I’m not actually trying to buy 100 shares of Best Buy at 110 by Friday.

Don’t leverage or buy too many contracts, that’s how big oopsies happen haha, timing is so crucial that you can have a good play and lose if you enter at the wrong time. And usually, on a better stock than BBY, you would’ve been able to close it for a profit in a few mins or hours. I was surprised it took so long. I like big defined movements on Apple personally, as everyone loves apple and will buy it when it drops a decent amount. To make it better sit and watch the contracts for a while and see them move. Sometimes you can see that if Apple is going up or down too much (a while of straight down or straight up where it looks almost parabolic) if it starts picking up, the contracts start going crazy and you can usually get in there and get out (still risky and not all the time clearly) sometimes you need to cut losses, average down to current contract price when the value drops a bunch (If you timed it wrong) so when it it finally does start going your way you are fine (Risky).  \n\nHere is an example of an UBER put I grabbed at the low of the day. Unfortunately I sold too early because I usually take profit at 25% And uber was moving crazy. When you see a stock going like that keep watching, when it looks like it’s about to reverse, keep watching, when it keeps going up even more and at the point you’re comfortable risking it (you can always close the position at -5 or -10 dollars, I do that a lot if it doesn’t immediately go my way, especially if I have a bad feel and think it’ll keep going against me, lots of time I take the -10 loss and then after I sell, it goes back to what I paid for it or even more), Just buy just one contract in case it keeps going up and you need to average down. Usually it’ll reverse at least a little. In this case it came down a bunch and I missed over 100% \n\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/ajsrNPg", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for all the info and the lesson - this newbie really appreciates it!", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "Hope you averaged down or got out barely ahead on open!
