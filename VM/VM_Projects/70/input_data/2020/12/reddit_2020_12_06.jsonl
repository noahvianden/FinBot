{"title": "My 2 cents around an \"inevitable\" crash.", "selftext": "Just spit balling here, but is a crash really inevitable?\n\nTraditional trading is no more. Currencies all over the world are deflating due to insane debt levels. \n\nYour equity is better off being tied up with something that actually adds value, like businesses. \n\nIt doesn't really make sense to liquidate and move into a cash position that'll only deflate and lose value. \n\nI get that a crash is usually induced by a major sell off. But the scale of the crash back in March wasn't even that big. It crashed but relatively, it wasn't that big. And that was a freaking global pandemic, with so much uncertainty and everything shut. What would we need to top that? Nuclear war or something along those lines?\n\nThe ball game has changed and I don't think we can rely on historical trading as an accurate reference point. \n\nIn addition to this, the wealth gap we're seeing is unprecedented. Those who are most likely to be affected by a global catastrophe and need cash, probably don't have much tied up in the stock market. \n\nThe massive bull run we're seeing, to me sounds like simple supply and demand. Nobody wants to hold a deflating currency, so the demand for stocks naturally rises and is treated as a commodity like gold.\n\nKeen to see everyone's thoughts around this.
