{"title": "Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, December 9, 2020. Please enjoy!", "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, December 9, 2020**\n\nThe S&P 500 and Dow Jones hit record highs early in the morning before turning steeply negative as stimulus talks in Washington appear to hit a roadblock. \n\nToday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell spoke on the Senate floor and accused House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of ‚Äúdelaying, deflecting and moving the goalposts‚Äù during stimulus negotiations. This snuffed out investor confidence that a deal would get done, at least in the near-term. Here at Psycho, we don‚Äôt expect the passage of more stimulus until a change in White House administration and control of the Senate is decided. \n\nYesterday, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin revealed he offered Pelosi a new proposal worth $916 billion. He said his plan ‚Äúincludes money for state and local governments and robust liability protection for businesses, schools, and universities.‚Äù Last week, a bipartisan group of lawmakers had unveiled a stimulus outline worth about $908 billion, which diverged from Mnuchin‚Äôs plan on some key issues, including offering $300 per week in augmented unemployment benefits absent from Mnuchin‚Äôs proposal, according to Yahoo Finance.\n\nEarlier in the week, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released data that reaffirmed that Pfizer (PFE) and BioNTech‚Äôs (BNTX) vaccine candidate was effective within approximately 10 days after the dose and showed strong protection regardless of age, weight, race, or gender. The FDA is now scheduled to convene its panel of outsider Thursday, with the group expected to vote on the approval of the vaccine.\n\nThe United States recorded its second-worst day of infections Tuesday, with another 220,000 infections. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top infectious disease expert in the United States, says the full impact of Thanksgiving gatherings hasn‚Äôt been seen yet. He said, ‚ÄúThe blip from Thanksgiving isn't even here yet. So we‚Äôre getting those staggering numbers of new cases and hospitalizati0ns before we even feel the full brunt of the Thanksgiving holiday‚Äù. The US is averaging nearly 200,000 infections and 2,237 deaths in the last seven numbers, the deadliest week in the pandemic since late April, according to Johns Hopkins University. There are well over 100,000 patients hospitalized with coronavirus.\n\n**Highlights** \n\n* Canada officially approves Pfizer (PFE) and BioNTech‚Äôs (BNTX) coronavirus vaccine.\n* The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and a coalition of attorneys general from 48 states and territories filed two separate antitrust lawsuits against Facebook (FB) on Wednesday. The lawsuits target two of Facebook‚Äôs major acquisitions, Instagram and WhatsApp, alleging anticompetitive behavior. In response, Facebook General Counsel said, ‚ÄúAntitrust laws exist to protect consumers and promote innovation, not to punish successful businesses. Instagram and WhatsApp became the incredible products they are today because Facebook invested billions of dollars, and years of innovation and expertise, to develop new features and better experiences for the millions who enjoy those products. The most important fact in this case, which the Commission does not mention in its 53-page complaint, is that it cleared these acquisitions years ago. The government now wants a do-over.‚Äú\n* QuantumScape, the electric battery developer was on fire again today, up around 30% in the day. The stock is up 125% since the merger finalized.\n* DoorDash (DASH) shares open for trading at $182, almost double their IPO price of $105. \n* Apple (AAPL) target raised by Wedbush from $150 to $160 OUTPERFORM. \n* Advanced Energy Systems (AEIS) target raised by Rosenblatt Securities from $107 to $120.\n* Casey's General Store (CASY) target raised by Deutsche Bank (DB) from $218 to $220 at OUTPERFORM. Stock currently around $180s\n* Airbnb is all set to make the IPO tomorrow, Thursday Dec 10. Raising the price in advance, for good measure.\n* Chewy (CHWY) with a host of target raises by notable analysts after a good earnings report. Average price target of $85 with OUTPERFORM rating\n* Disney (DIS) with a series of target raises. \n   * Loop Capital from $150 to $175\n   * Morgan Stanley from $160 to %175\n   * Credit Suisse from $146 to $178\n* Fiserv (FISV) with multiple target raises. \n   * Wells Fargo from $125 to $135 OVERWEIGHT\n   * Raymond James from $120 to $132 OUTPERFORM\n* Generac (GNRC) target raised by JP MOrgan (JPM) from $235 to $258.\n* (JD) target raised by Loop Capital from $99 to $105. Stock currently around $82\n* Qualcomm (QCOM) target raised by Cowen from $170 to $180 OUTPERFORM. Stock currently around $160\n* SunOpta (STKL) target raised by Lake Street Capital from $9 to $15 at BUY, implying a 50% upside from current levels. \n* ROKU target raised by Citigroup (C) from $220 to $375, a very notable increase. Stock currently around $325 has been on a tear this year\n* Lululemon (LULU) with massive target increase by Raymond James from $400 to $500 at STRONG-BUY. Stock currently around $375.\n\n‚ÄúIf you know your own mind, you know enough to keep it always positive.‚Äù - Napoleon Hill", "id": "ka10kh", "created_utc": 1607548990.0, "score": 394, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 70, "comments": [{"body": "Ouch.

But while Tesla might be mostly \"things powering or powered by electric motors\" I disagree that it's \"all cars\". Cars are a huge part, but it's what they are doing *with* the cars that is the big idea. \n\nLet's talk Tesla semis for an example, because it's not something they have fully in place yet, so it's all over and above any of their current business. \n\nBTW, disclaimer - below is all my own speculation based on what I have seen Tesla do and Elon talk about on conference calls, while he or I was high, etc. I'm not your financial advisor, don't treat me like one, etc.\n\n------------------\n\nBear take: Selling semi trucks is a low margin business limited by price even more than selling automobiles. A regular car company that makes semis isn't likely to sell a lot of semis compared to the number of cars they sell. Tesla semis are going to be more expensive up front than ICE semis. Tesla semis should not therefore have a huge material effect on Tesla's income. \n\n------------------\n\nBull take: The initial price of the truck is not the total cost, and shipping companies consider price per mile cost in addition to the initial purchase price. Price per mile includes costs for gas, maintenance and... the driver. All told, these the price per mile cost can be orders of magnitude higher than the truck sticker price. \n\nIn 2026 the market for heavy duty trucks is about 100 billion and is estimated to be up to 430 Billion by 2026. That's just for the truck hardware, not the total market for shipping costs. It's realistic to think that if Tesla can offer truck with a vastly cheaper cost of per mile operation (due to self driving and electric drive), that they can take a larger bite of that market than the 2 billion that analysts have suggested they can take. \n\n------------------\n\nRaging Bull take: What if Tesla doesn't sell the semis at all? Tesla has the means to reinvent how shipping happens and Elon's mission tells us they may be planning to do so.  \n\nTesla has already said publicly that they intend to stop selling cars at consumer prices once full self driving is realized and move to a different model (i.e. UBER, but no drivers.) Trucks on demand is just an extension of this idea and would allow Tesla to change the business of ground transportation.\n\nTesla is continually building a worldwide energy generation and distribution system, and they make trucks with ultra-low per-mile costs (again, due to self driving and electric drive) and assuming FSD, Tesla can likely undercut the current average shipping costs of 1.50 to 4.00 per mile by a substantial percentage. (Potentially half or more)\n\nWith that in mind... How much of the approximately 800 billion dollars spent shipping freight every year could be moved to an automated on-demand Tesla shipping fleet powered by the sun?\n\nAgain, this is all me spitballing on just semis, which is just one aspect of the Tesla, but it's one of the reasons I'm in the stock.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Software you say?

I wasnt excited about the timefram and thus didnt do more, but w the PSTH rise they are already very profitable and I closed many of them. Just doesnt make sense a cash redeemable instrument would be far below its redemption. Still don't know who was buying but the fact it took me weeks to sell all the puts at the prices I wanted told me at least there was a tiny market, and thus it was probably a shitty investment.", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "Im going to end up rolling my $35.
