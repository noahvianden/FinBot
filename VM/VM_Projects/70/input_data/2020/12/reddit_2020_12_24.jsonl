{"title": "Why buying pltr @ $25 or $30 right now won't matter in next 20 or 100 years 🚀🚀🚀 this is like buying Coca Cola in 1919", "selftext": "The Coca Cola purchase was famous because it was the first major investment where Buffett paid much more relative to earnings and assets than he did for most of his other investments.\n\nWarren Buffett and Charlie Munger started buying Coca Cola in 1988. By the end of the year, Berkshire Hathaway owned 14,172,500 shares which cost $592.54 million. In 1989, they bought 9,177,500 additional shares for $431.38 million. By the end of 1989, they owned a total of 23,350,000 shares or 6.2% of the company which they bought for $1.023 billion. Their stake was so big that it accounted for almost 35% of Berkshire Hathaway's entire common stock holdings.\n\nIf you had invested $40 into a single share of Coca-Cola in 1919 during the IPO, you own 9,216 shares after all the stock splits over the years. This equates to $394,500 as of March 26, 2020. If you had reinvested dividends, your investment would be worth over $10 million. This represents a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.27% from 1919 to 2012.\n\nReason for this post is when Buffet started investing in Coca-Coca in 1987 ,people thought Coke ride is over . Coke established in 1892 so that means he was investing in this company after almost 100 years, they went public in 1919 at $40 so someone made a calculation which I heard in some lectures that after first 20 years passed of its IPO t 1919, if someone had invested fresh $40 in 1938 in Coke stock then in 1993 it would be $25000 . The stock has split two times since 1994, bringing Berkshire's ownership to 400 million shares. The cost basis on those shares is $1.299 billion. At the current stock price of $51.71 per share, Berkshire's investment in Coke is worth $20.7 billion. That leaves an unrealized gain of $19.4 billion on the investment.\n\nThe gains are even larger when factoring in dividends. At Coke's current quarterly payout of $0.40 per share, Berkshire's 400 million shares will bring in $640 million over the next year in dividend income. Since 1995, it has earned about $7 billion in dividends from the Coke investment.", "id": "kjjdys", "created_utc": 1608831660.0, "score": 133, "upvote_ratio": 0.77, "num_comments": 74, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 426, "replies": [{"body": "But if you had bought a single share your investment would be worth almost $400K!
