If they live up to expectations, they will significantly outpace the performance of the latest machines running Intel chips, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because the plans aren’t yet public. Intel’s shares slid 1.7% in early trading in New York Monday after the news. Apple shares were little changed.\n\nThe road map indicates Apple’s confidence that it can differentiate its products on the strength of its own engineering and is taking decisive steps to design Intel components out of its devices. The next two lines of Apple chips are also planned to be more ambitious than some industry watchers expected for next year. The company said it expects to finish the transition away from Intel and to its own silicon in 2022.\n\nWhile Intel gets less than 10% of its revenue from furnishing Apple with Mac chips, the rest of its PC business is liable to face turbulence if the iPhone maker is able to deliver demonstrably better-performing computers. It could accelerate a shakeup in an industry that has long been dependent on Intel’s pace of innovation. For Apple, the move sheds that dependency, deepens its distinction from the rest of the PC market and gives it a chance to add to its small, but growing share in PCs.", "id": "k8gsv0", "created_utc": 1607348463.0, "score": 143, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 68, "comments": [{"body": "This new chips are a revolution in the making.

There is a paradigm shift where many compute intensive tasks are being offload to an accelerator (GPU).  This includes both tradition compute intensive tasks and AL/ML applications. Here NVidia is the clear leader, AMD is catching up quickly, but Intel is a distant 3rd with no competitive solution insight. Intel's delay will have long lasting impacts. It takes a significant effort to develop software that can efficiently use an accelerator and each company's accelerators currently use a different architecture. Thus there will be a delay between when Intel develops competitive hardware, and when there is software to use their product. \n\nThe one market where high end CPU still reign supreme is gaming, which is a huge market.

This is a big factor that determine the cost of running a data center. This directly determines the cost of electricity required to run the computation and is also determines the infrastructure and electricity costs needed to cool the center. The more energy a computation uses, the more heat it generates, and the more cooling is needed. Thus an important metric that is commonly used when designing a data center is FLOPs per watt. This measures how efficiently a center can perform a computation and is strongly related to the cost of a computation. In this metric general purpose GPUs handily beat CPUs, and the fact is that it's not even close. Thus the switch to GPU offloading represents a substation savings over the life of a data center. This fact is the driving force behind the paradigm shift to GPU offloading for applications that require **raw power.** ML/AI applications are often talked about in this shift because it's relatively easy to offload their typical workflow to a general purpose GPU and can often result is substantial speed up..

You ever hear of Calloway Golf (ELY)?  \n\nIts a golf sporting equipment company that designs, manufactures, markets and sells golf equipment products, more specifically clubs and balls, also including accessories such as bags, gloves, and caps. But the company has now taken a huge step and expanding the ability to create revenue and bring more recognition to their brand, and finding a new way to target new golfers. THEY ACCQUIRED TOPGOLF.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[They sell equipment for golf](https://preview.redd.it/a2bzny0juo361.png?width=275&format=png&auto=webp&s=17e342d886306a04a286e90fe170538a0fb6cf1e)\n\nTopgolf is a global sports entertainment company. It is a game that anyone can play (and win). Score points by hitting micro-chipped golf balls at giant dartboard-like targets on an outfield. The closer you get your ball to the center or 'bullseye' and the further the distance, the more points earned. Making it competitive. Meanwhile they find ways to sell you food, beer, have a bar, sell merchandise, and host parties. Plus the locations across the country and world (UK and Australia) are really cool and look like something out of a sci-fi movie at night with all the cool lights. Below I posted pictures of the location. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[TopGolf Location](https://preview.redd.it/n7tomtnlto361.png?width=300&format=png&auto=webp&s=9aa87799d68b05fad89d38e8472b44845464bbe2)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Outside the place view](https://preview.redd.it/1kdxq6lpto361.png?width=310&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3e68c33ae2f759a26491589a79e4d0eb854e0a5)\n\nEvery time I have gone to this place day or night it is packed. Making reservations on a weekend night? Better fucking do it 14 months ahead of time if you even watch a shot at securing the reservation. They have 5 hour wait times on weekend nights and is open well into the morning and still have to turn away customers The place fucking sells and it is awesome. Way better then watching your wife fuck her boyfriend on a Friday night. These places are popular and are only going to grow as it is a fairly young acquisition. It was founded in the year 2000. Highly recommend you go to a Topgolf location, even my young non boomer ass who can't swing a driver to save his life thought it was a great time. Look at the fucking pictures and tell me you wouldn't take the family or boys out for a night to get fucked up and spend 100$ rather then 500$ because your broke ass keeps buying puts on TSLA. Well by doing this play....you can finally make enough money to afford a fun night at Topgolf and just maybe...MAYBE...your wife won't fuck her boyfriend for one night and give you a chance.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Valuation and reasoning for the run up:** Calloway is a 2.15 billion mid cap stock right now. It has been at these levels before and has retard strength momentum right now as it is trading at around 23 dollars a share. Earlier a few weeks ago it was at 16$..this has the possibility to be the next fucking meme stock for wallstreetbets but you autists won't pile into it because it seems to good to be true...but once again this will make you money rather then donating it to the wall street rich guys through TSLA puts. **The fact that it acquired Topgolf is a gamechanger. It made 1.1 billion dollars in revenue in 2019 and has grown at a 30% compound annual rate since 2017.** has made this stock (ELY) a fucking game changer. Morgan Stanley put a $30 price target on this stock in the next year. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe only negative comment regarding the TopGolf merger I've seen is that ELY paid too much for the company, especially during a pandemic. This view is very shortsighted because back in 2017 ELY valued their 14% stake in TopGolf at a $2.1Billion valuation, which is before the company had 3 years of 30%/year growth. Other than the weak overvaluation argument, the analysts are unanimous in calling the TopGolf deal transformational to ELY and expect the company to deliver strong growth for many, many years. A vaccine or treatment for the virus should arriving soon, which would make the TopGolf deal suddenly undervalued again and send ELY shares to new highs. TopGolf is currently in hypergrowth mode, especially with their Top Tracer business which is only 1% penetrated worldwide. I listened to the merger conference call and it was obvious that the ELY CEO was being overly conservative in his projections, it sounded like the EBITDA projections he was giving was the bare minimum that the combined business will achieve. Definitely and under promise, over deliver scenario here. \n\nTopGolf rakes in money. Now Callaway equipment will be in front of everyone that walks through those doors. I understand the dilution worries but they acquired TopGolf for an incredible price. Looking long term this is a great acquisition to help them broaden their footprint.\n\nTime to go balls deep in LEAPS and monthlys. \n\nCurrently I am in 1/15/21 23$ calls\n\nEdit: This literally can’t go tits up unless golf is banned", "id": "k89bp8", "created_utc": 1607314202.0, "score": 94, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 75, "comments": [{"body": "You can’t even spell the company name that you are pumping. \n\nI’m in.", "score": 237, "replies": [{"body": "Hahahahaha I love this sub", "score": 15, "replies": []}, {"body": "Where can I learn this power?", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "Do some research on something.
