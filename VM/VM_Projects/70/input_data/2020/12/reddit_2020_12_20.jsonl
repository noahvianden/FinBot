Note that the OTM option loses on average 60% of the value when you sell it if the SPX index has an average return for the 30 days.

Inconsistently.\n\nThe reason it depends is how recent volatility flows have been. I realize that this defeats the purpose. So instead of closing and opening a new one 'tomorrow' I intend to start same day. \n\n'rolling' is tricky. This is definitely not the 'tasty trade' rolling method of 45 days out, etc. Vastly more sophisticated and difficult, because it requires discretion. Typically, I decide later that I have mis-hedged and out to have been more aggressive. But I am still alive so there is that.\n\nI prefer shorter dates. 1 -3 months. This is due to the gamma. I want increasing gamma on a continued move down. Shorter dates help with that. Longer requires more precise scaling and can be messed up easier, I think.\n\nIf your structures are laid out so that you want further dated exposure, you could in fact do some sort of ratioed spread. So, sell an ATM put in the front and then buy (say) a 25 put in the back month. But at a 1:2 or 2:3 ratio. In essence, as you move into the wing of the structure, you pick up gamma and can become profitable rather quickly. This requires Large Move: Given move. So dropping a dollar or two on the day may not do much. \n\nBut then it gets into structure bleed. I've held for a week, had a few bucks, can now afford 2 6-packs and the commission. On this I am unsure and your question really gets at this. To what extent is it better to move the strikes or hold it? If we assume that volatility is autocorrelating, to what extent is this down move set to recede? Or, is the structure now coming into decent moneyness and it would be best to close and set anew? Or, would you want to both keep the structure and buy up deltas in order to come flat/profit should a next day be an up?(hedge off the deltas, given the movement)\n\nSo I am torn. I conclude several things. Need a better structure, need a better volatility map, need to include some sort of jump pricing. But if the volatility holds the same 'price' after jump, then I am back at square 1. \n\nOn the other hand, taking the beer money has an immediate, tangible, result.
