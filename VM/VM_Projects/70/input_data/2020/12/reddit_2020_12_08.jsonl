There are two types. Calls and puts. \n\nCall options govern someone’s right to purchase the stock. Let’s say I buy a call option with a strike price of $15 on some stock $XYZ which is currently trading at $12 with an expiry of Feb 19, 2021. I give someone money (the option’s price or *premium*) for the right to purchase 100 shares of $XYZ from them for $1500 before or on Feb 19. I don’t own the shares but I have something that will change in value as the share price does (a *derivative*) if the share price rockets next week to $14.50 I’ll own a contract which is worth a lot more than I paid for it because of the chance it will end up “in the money” ie at a point where $XYZ is worth more than $15 a share (let’s say $17) and I can make a guaranteed buck by *exercising* my call and buying the stock for $1500 and immediately selling for $1700. Naturally if the stock price fails to reach $15 by the expiry date my contract becomes literally worthless, a risk which is not really present for stocks in general; at the same time the person on the other end faces incredible risk because the stock price can increase to $60 a share and they’re on the hook for my $5500 (minus the premium I paid for the call) profit; this is particularly bad if he did not own the stock outright (was naked, as opposed to covered if he owned it and could just begrudgingly hand over his stock that went to the moon). In this example I bought the call or was long on the call and the other guy was short on the call or sold the call. ELI5 call goes up when stock goes up. Long/buy call = bet stock goes up; short/sell call = bet stock goes down or stays sideways. \n\nA put is the exact opposite so you can buy a put which secures the right to *sell* someone shares. So in the previous example pretend $XYZ is trading at $17 and we buy a put option with $15 strike on it. We are now hoping that the stock price goes BELOW $15 before expiry. Let’s say it goes to $13. I go ahead and purchase 100 shares on the market for $1300 and then exercise my put option and sell them to the poor guy on the other side for $1500–> $200 profit (minus the premium I paid for the put originally). ELI5: stock goes down put goes up. Long/buy put = bet stock goes down; short/sell put = bet stock doesn’t go down.\n\nSome general things to know:\n\n1. Options lose value everyday because everyday there’s less opportunity for price movement. \n\n1a. The conclusion of this is your option could well be worth $0.00 on expiry day\n\n2. Options are weird and move based on more than just stock go up call go up like I’ve explained here. \n\n3. Even over their worst years most companies you’ve heard of won’t have their stock go to $0. \n\n4. Options are leveraged meaning that their value moves as a multiple of the share price changes. If you’re wrong you are very wrong and you only have so many days to wait out being right. It isn’t enough to be right about the direction your homework has a due date. \n\n5. Some but not all options plays can open you up to infinite risk like the fellow who sold me the call if he didn’t actually own the shares. It’s gonna be a rough day for him if he wakes up and sees that the stock price went to $200 and I can buy his shares for $15 pop. \n\n6.

{"title": "Coming Back to Electric Truck Player Hyliion (HYLN) - and DD", "selftext": "Months ago, I treated Hyliion's former ticker as a big money-making swing trade on its \"IPO pop.\"  I'm fortunate to have been in the same blockbuster event as [one Blake Denton](https://old.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/jwu6sh/making_money_in_best_reverse_mergers_and_cramer/).\n\nNow, I come back to HYLN, not with the aim of making money in the best reverse mergers, but with a small investment for the long term.\n\nWithout further adieu, DD follows.\n\n**About Hyliion**\n\nThe company description below comes from a recent Business Wire article.  I can't provide the link as a certain other company can't be mentioned in the link itself:\n\n> Hyliion’s mission is to be the leading provider of electrified powertrain solutions for the commercial vehicle industry. Hyliion’s goal is to reduce the carbon intensity and GHG emissions of the transportation sector by providing electrified powertrain solutions for Class 8 commercial vehicles at the lowest total cost of ownership (TCO). Hyliion’s solutions utilize its proprietary battery systems, control software and data analytics combined with fully integrated electric motors and power electronics, to produce electrified powertrain systems that either augment—in the case of Hyliion’s Hybrid systems—or fully replace—in the case of the fully electric Hypertruck ERX system—traditional diesel or natural gas fueled powertrains and improve their performance. By reducing both GHG emissions and TCO, Hyliion’s environmentally conscious solutions support its customers’ pursuit of their sustainability and financial objectives.\n\n**Investor Presentation**\n\nAs someone else wrote here, [Hyliion (HYLN) is not the next Nikola.  This is a good thing.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/j03etb/hyliion_hyln_is_not_the_next_nikola_this_is_a/)\n\nThe company's Investor Presentation can be found on [their website's Investors page](https://investors.hyliion.com/overview/default.aspx).\n\nAs can be shown in the presentation:\n\n1) HYLN has its defined niche: Class 8 trucks.  Not even Tesla will be competing in this field, for a decade or more.\n\n2) HYLN has a total addressable market of $800 billion in the US alone.  One customer, Agility, operates in 100 countries.\n\n3) HYLN won't play the capital-intensive game of setting up EV-related infrastructure.  They are not in the business of being a \"gas station.\"\n\n4) HYLN will first use renewable natural gas and natural gas generators for its Hypertruck electrified powertrain systems, yet is already developing them to be compatible with fully electric solutions such as hydrogen fuel cells.  They are being practical here in addressing the needs of original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) of trucks (for the trucking industry).\n\n5) HYLN already has operational prototypes.\n\n6) HYLN already has million-mileage logs for the first number of trucks already deployed.\n\n**Renewable Natural Gas**\n\n[An article on FreightWaves](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/nikola-hyliion-defend-divergent-paths-to-zero-emission-trucking) provides a brief summary of what renewable natural gas is:\n\n> Renewable natural gas (RNG) starts as a biogas from the decomposition of organic matter, such as wastewater, food, green waste and farming. It is cleaned and processed into biomethane that is injected into the pipeline. When used as a transportation fuel, RNG has a negative carbon intensity, said Deanna Haines, director of Energy & Environmental Policy at SoCalGas.\n\nRNG production is expected to double in the near future.\n\nInfrastructure-wise, there are plenty of natural gas stations in Europe.  For example, Italy has over 1,400, while Germany has over 800.\n\n**Battery Management Supply Chain**\n\nTwo years ago, Hyliion [acquired Gentherm's battery division](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/equipment/hyliion-acquires-battery-producer) to have its battery management supply chain in-house.\n\n**Financials**\n\nFuture-oriented revenue data (projections), per the Investor Presentation, are as follows:\n\n2020: $1 million\n\n2021: $8 million\n\n2022: $344 million\n\n2023: $1.0 billion\n\n2024: $2.1 billion\n\nNot every target company in a reverse merger discloses current or historical financial information.  In this case, however, [such information can be found in an SEC filing](https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-20-022028/?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=c38d42b8c68dad4fd4c816b5799dca4bdbe435aa-1601600373-0-Ae7hxOZAy6LXjWjw6G7Ra_bQuy3Ig2re0xzZ8HVp3NVtRg9gOZ5UW-0RpnGg7RMobRYDNgh92m3CLI6_6k-MCw37XKHDzhqXsb7mFT7iOpdy6MWA5MmZDeLPzdmwjftk-8c17hucybdmgOAOT2jSXkLq8EKx3JW11mzOSq1OdzbNrRlsDNo4PBbPshX1D7_0H_3jIyGFkesJQTFSKlqU5VgiVIsKYwGqGh0xUOpq9apt1EOGGQh4UPw7ZpYFYlJduNqSM48x8ZtJn3L4CTdkTRbBINYlTg0c4elHQXkcxtIQpP1bCLZ1aMTRwKqmtTNDSMhiMj0Tv0EMfU5lBYL_xHNul5htXHIinMHI7D2xxBGW8VfbbFp1gRuuUJoeZylFnw#ta_006).\n\n**Values and Governance**\n\nHyliion has just committed to its reverse merger while having a non-classified board.  It's one thing to assert that the company isn't conducive to fraud like Nikola has been (such as plastic model vehicles with no operating prototypes, or fake orders).  It's quite another to demonstrate this.\n\nOne of the problems Nikola has is having a classified board.  In the long run, a classified board isn't as effective as a non-classified board.  This comparison extends to fraud prevention.\n\n**Stock Price Disadvantages**\n\nBeing an engineer by background, Thomas Healy does not have the marketing skills of Trevor Milton.\n\nWhile Hyliion itself has the potential to break away from the Nikola drama, HYLN's price will likely remain quite dependent upon TSLA's price movements, just like all the other stocks in the EV space.  Any out-of-control tweet by Elon Musk, let alone any performance hiccup over at Tesla, could have adverse effects on HYLN.\n\n**Stock Price Advantages**\n\nEven I expected a second wave of COVID-19 to have a correction effect on tech stocks.  I was mistaken in this regard, as large institutional funds have rotated back into the tech sector, including that part of it which is future-tech oriented (TSLA, SHOP, FSLY, ZM, etc.).\n\n**Evaluation**\n\nHYLN is a solid hold for at least five years, maybe even ten.  It is definitely worth a starter position first thing in the morning, and an additional position or two later in the day, for DCA purposes.\n\n*Disclosure: Will be long 50 shares very shortly, if not already.*", "id": "k8vn1j", "created_utc": 1607395148.0, "score": 115, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 76, "comments": [{"body": "I’m bullish on HYLN.

Unfortunately, they're kind of blowing it so far, which is why the stock has acted like a boat anchor.  \n\nHYLN's claim to fame is an electric and/or CNG powered axle that can be popped onto (supposedly) any new or used semi-truck.\n\nAs such, installing their axle instantly lowers the cost of fuel for that truck.  How much and what the payback period is becomes a matter of estimates and calculations, but there are immediate operational savings, plus the trucking operator can instantly claim they are  \"green\".\n\nThe bad news though is Hyliion axles have an extremely short window of attractiveness which ends as soon as electric trucks start being *perceived* as becoming readily available.  That window was probably 5 years.  HYLN has screwed up by dragging their feet through the first two years of that window.\n\nEvery day they continue to move at a (can't post the animal's name because it's banned here) pace, they've wasted more of that window.\n\nWatching them treat 2021 as a similar lazy gap year is painful.  \n\nTrucking operators could have viewed Hyllion as their 3-5 year stop gap while they await fancy new EV trucks in 2023 and beyond.  \n\nBut with Hyliion setting such low and slow timelines, they're killing their own chances.  Now, when a trucking operator considers buying an expensive Hyliion axle in 2022 or 2023, they'll say \"why bother, let's just wait a year and get a (pick a name) EV truck\".  The Hyliion axle payback window will be too short to bother.  Some may even feel that way in 2021.\n\nWhat's particularly aggravating is they and their fans' lack of any sense of urgency.  Their axle is relatively simple engineering and install.  They should have spent 2020 moving heaven and earth to swap these on as many vehicles as humanly possible, even if they had to get stringers in garages all over America, and regardless of pricing, just to get the concept rolling faster.  Number of units deployed would have made a huge difference, for the brand and (especially) for the stock.\n\nInstead, they set them themselves a microscopic goal of just $1 million in sales, then missed that, but called it a win because they're redefining the plan and treating 2020 like R&D.  Missing your own mediocre goal and patting yourself on the back for it is not how startups succeed.\n\nThis is a space with tons of competition that moves incredibly fast.  Hyllion's SPAC name was foreshadowing of their lackadaisical attitude at a time when their pace should be more frantic.\n\nStill, even if they blow this once promising opportunity, they have a second backup chance to succeed.  \n\nMaybe with some management and/or attitude changes, they can use a more eager approach to the full EV truck market, and position themselves to be just like one of the other (many) EV truck plays.  Some will win and some will lose.  Maybe HYLN will be one of the winners.

How much will fuel cost next week, next month, next year? How long will these yet-to-be-proven axles run?    If the fuel saving is $40-60k and the axle is $55k is it worth modifying the rig, and taking it out of service for the swap, and worrying about a breakdown somewhere where there's no service for an experimental axle and no replacement for 8 weeks?  But what if fuel spikes and suddenly it's a $55k vs $80k consideration?
