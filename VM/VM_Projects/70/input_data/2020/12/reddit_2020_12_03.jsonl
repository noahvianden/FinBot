If I didnt know better I'd say most the review sites and companies get paid for advertising and lobbying by OEM and not by Tesla so they crap on $TSLA whenever the check arrives. \n\nBattery day and Q3 earnings were 2 months ago and suddenly these analysts get hip when the price jumps so they dont want to look like idiots by being hundreds below current value.  I'm long TSLA and I can freely admit it is overvalued at this exact moment but it has clear path to market leader and autonomous driving breaks valuation.  \n\nSo if you think that mankind will have self driving within 10 years then you should get in and if not sit it out maybe.
