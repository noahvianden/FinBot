Company existence (which, in Boeing's case, can partly be attributed to American nationalism) and incompetence are not mutually exclusive.

There was even a reddit post when the MAX-8 crashes occurred, by a Boeing engineer who described the software and testing process to be out of order and messy. The MAX-8 crashes are a direct result of such issues. Also, your metric of \"2% of the time over the 100+ years\" sounds reasonable to judge competency on, but not for the aviation industry, where that 2% leads to lives lost.
