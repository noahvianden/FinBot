Looks like it really depends on if they are going to readjust the % share to match the $12.75 strike or not. If they are you should be in the clear since they proved they will hold the strike. If not, it depends on ERI, but you should still be relatively safe assuming ERI doesn't pull some crazy streak.\n\nRemember this is a multi billion dollar deal though, a couple million per day isn't bank breaking (a fraction of a single percentage) and it is worth more to them to get it accurate than to rush to try and squeeze out some haircut millions in the deal.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "Yes", "score": 5, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Not bad but think WYNN or MGM are likley the stronger plays", "score": 8, "replies": []}, {"body": "I don't have shit for brains anyways, 5/15 $10c", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "That's what I got too, am I retarded?", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "fuck yeah WE are", "score": 5, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "i have $9 calls for 6/19. please got let them print.", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "I bought CZR in March.
