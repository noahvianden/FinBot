{"title": "Infinite Money Hack", "selftext": "1.  US Government with backing of Fed has rolled out a huge stimulus for businesses and people\n\n2.  YOU the people may receive stimulus money.  This money is not to help you, but to help businesses, it is STIMULUS, for stimulating businesses.\n\n3.  The theory is that the new debt taken on will be taken care of by increased consumption.  (nintendo, netflix, amazon, walmart, etc)\n\n4.  YOU do not spend this money, and do not keep in bank.  (neg. interest rates will be plan if you keep in bank).  In fact pay off all debts, and withdraw all cash.  This will confuse Powell and Mnuchin.\n\n5.  Economy not stimulated, so the economic recovery team will panic because deflation is setting in.   Then we get more free money, double, no triple this time!  Till december or forever UBI.  \n\n6.  As long as you keep saving this stimulus money under your bed the government will keep sending more.  They have to, without consumption the economy will crash like nothing ever witnessed.\n\n7.  Remember to make this an infinite money hack, do not consume!  If you consume the money will stop flowing.  By not consuming, paying off debt, and keeping cash on hand, you are removing the support beams to the ponzi scheme.\n\nTLDR:  boycott consumption and get infinite stimulus.\n\nThanks for reading my PSA.\n\n\n**1** Friday Update\nI know it's only been <12 hrs, but our movement has gained retarded strength, the first of our plans ipo is being launched here with pt's coming in nearly $2k per person per month!  \n\nBut stil hodl ok cuz $5k is my pt, diamond hands\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/ryanguina/2020/05/08/a-new-2000-monthly-stimulus-payment-proposed-by-senators-harris-sanders-and-markey/", "id": "gfmxxq", "created_utc": 1588914945.0, "score": 377, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 69, "comments": [{"body": "I'm so glad someone  else is on mushrooms right now.", "score": 199, "replies": [{"body": "Trip hard as fuck and go all in on SPY puts\nProfit(spiritually)", "score": 18, "replies": [{"body": "unfortunately only spiritually, but that's actually worth more than money", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "To be precise, spiritual profit is worth negative money.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "true!", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Puts or calls", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Calls til I die", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "8.
