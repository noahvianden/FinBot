Since none of their contracts or vendors are tied to TRIF they have no worries about losing business to reporting accidents.\n\nEdit: You should also be suspicious of your source.  The industry does not use injuries per employees as a metric for calculating how safe a place is or not.  With this metric having a lower accident rate could simply mean you just have less full time employees.... and not less accidents.

China, India and europe are all trying to purchase oil in their own currencies. In such a world, you may still need dollars at some point and securities are a much better asset to hold than just 320tonnes of gold or FX reserves.
