Both realised (long before the americans) that oil demand was about to drop by 30%. Rather than fight each other for market share, they decided to cooperate. That's why the saudis booked up most of the oil tankers back in February. It has been incredibly successful, with oil prices remaining relatively stable for brent and the oil prices remaining high enough for opec producers to remain broadly profitabe (even if they cant fully fund sovereign deficits).  \n\nPersonally, I don't have a problem with this. That's just how the oil markets work.", "score": 29, "replies": [{"body": "I like your view. However I don’t think they expected such a wild decreases, they only needed an oil below 40$ to kill the shale, not go to 15-25$ range.\nHave a look at their situation now, they have tripled VAT, stopped they monthly social security payment this was unthinkable few months back. it back fired !", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "I disagree. They cut their wholesale price to 7$bl and even offered additional discounts to European and Chinese companies. This is basically the breakeven price for oil production in Saudi.   \nThe have more than enough gold/fx reserves to cover their deficit for two years if they want and vat was already extremely low. The reduction in allowances is a bit of a red herring because being tenuously associated with the government or royal family grants you an allowance and makes you a defacto dollar millionaire.  \nThey are preserving their reserves for the upcoming fx wars I guarantee it.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "It was ballsy of American companies to dive so hard into shale despite its small margins.

Perhaps the tar sands are capable of covering Canadian energy demands, or that their export market to China remains politically in tact. I don't know.  \n Pipelines are probably pretty fucked, as I doubt export is on a strong footing.

I think it’s something like $3/barrel for them to actually extract the oil but obviously they need a far higher price to balance their budget. My conspiracy is they saw this decline in demand as an opportunity to start a price war and fuck shale out of business. They’d only have to bear with these low prices for like a year and as a country they have far more access to capital to float through than shale companies do. Then when demand is back to normal it’s going to take a while for all the shale companies to start their operations all over again which allows Saudi and OPEC to enjoy high prices again for even longer.
