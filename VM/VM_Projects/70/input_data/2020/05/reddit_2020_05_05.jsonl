{"title": "ATVI Earnings", "selftext": "ATVI's Call of Duty Warzone is the hottest game of the year. Its soo good that it will catch Fortnite in sales and rival them in active users by years end. They have 50 million players after only one month. That is crazy! Warzone is the best COD game since Black Ops 2. Even young kids are moving away from Fortnite and playing Warzone. Sales are gonna be through the roof due to Coronavirus lock downs and stay at home orders. ATVI will open tomorrow between $67.50- $71. It will then shoot up to $77 after earnings. Plus DOW Futures are GREEN right now.
