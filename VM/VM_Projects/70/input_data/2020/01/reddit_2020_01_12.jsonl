{"title": "Yale economists argue that \"the most financially responsible\" long-term investment is a leveraged index. Article link and abstract in description. What do you think?", "selftext": "https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1149340\n\nABSTRACT: By employing leverage to gain more exposure to stocks when young, individuals can achieve better diversification across time. Using stock data going back to 1871, we show that buying stock on margin when young combined with more conservative investments when older stochastically dominates standard investment strategies?both traditional life-cycle investments and 100%-stock investments. The expected retirement wealth is 90% higher compared to life-cycle funds and 19% higher compared to 100% stock investments. The expected gain would allow workers to retire almost six years earlier or extend their standard of living during retirement by 27 years.\n\nSome key things to discuss (in my view):\n\nWe're taking young investors only. If you are retiring in 10 years I'm sure you'd delever.\n\n- There are ways to leverage that don't involve borrowing money. Example: SSO.\n\n- Do daily balancing costs offset the gains? The article above gives a clear explanation of why they DONT. If you think they do (which is a very reasonable position), tell us where these authors make a mistake.\n\n- There's a huge psychological element. There's sure to be a 25% crash in the next 20 years. Seeing your entire retirement go down 75% might be a reason not to do this. However, let's suppose you ARE psychologically ready. Then is this the best way to save for retirement?", "id": "enrow9", "created_utc": 1578855872.0, "score": 230, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 70, "comments": [{"body": "Theoretically the best investment is the leveraged minimum variance portfolio.", "score": 46, "replies": [{"body": "> leveraged minimum variance portfolio\n\nThanks for this.

This article will do a better job at explaining it then I'll be able to do:\n\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/efficientfrontier.asp\n\nTo achieve the minimum variance portfolio, you'll want 2 assets that both have positive returns but that negatively correlate to each other. Most often this is a stock ETF and a bond ETF, since stocks and government bonds are both positive returning assets that are negatively correlated. Since when one of these assets is up the other is usually down, your risk to your portfolio is lower. This way you can increase your leverage and therefore returns, without as drastically increasing your risk. I can't link seeking alpha article on reddit, but look up Logan Kane's \"Why leverage ETFs might be perfect for achieving retirement\" for a walkthrough on how this works. I would recommend looking at a portfolio of 60% UPRO (a x3 leveraged S&P 500 ETF) and 40% TMF (a x3 leverage long term gov bond ETF).
