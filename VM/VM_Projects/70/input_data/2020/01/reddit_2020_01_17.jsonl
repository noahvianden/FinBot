{"title": "How to play potential $TSLA decline", "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nSo I wrote 3 days ago [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eodce4/nflx_jun_18_423_peak_vs_tsla_today/) about how I expected $TSLA to peak soon and it looks like the very next day it did peak at $547.31. I wanted to offer a potential options play for y'all which I have been thinking about since that post (I originally said options looked too expensive, but that was dumb-ish).\n\nFirst of all we should ask ourselves, \"how far can Tesla fall?\". Below is an updated version of the original graphic I shared.\n\n[Climax tops: TSLA vs. NFLX. vs. AMD](https://preview.redd.it/xfo95r0oo8b41.png?width=2207&format=png&auto=webp&s=944b84d0bf096a8e0a8c601fb30369aa6cf7ff23)\n\nThis one compares Tesla's current climax top to both Netflix and AMD when they experienced similar moves. As you can see in the top row I have noted that NFLX experienced a decline of roughly 22% (this was generously excluding the Q4 2018 market crash which, if included, would have made for a \\~40% decline peak to trough), and AMD experienced a decline of 47% peak to trough. Based on these numbers we could expect TSLA to fall a similar amount of 20-50% - a stock range of $274 to $438. Also worth noting (although it's not on the graph) is that these declines typically played out over 30-60 days.\n\nBottom line: A 20%+ decline looks likely within the next 60 days.\n\nAs I said in the original post: the options are too expensive IMO to simply buy OTM puts. I would recommend a bear put spread instead over a $10 range.\n\nLet's assume the weakest decline of our range, 20% to $440 within 60 days, and design an options play for that to see potential risk:reward.\n\nLong $450 March '20 Puts @ 21.75\n\nShort $440 March '20 Puts @ 17.75\n\nNet cost of $4.00 vs $10 payoff so 150% potential profit minimum if correct. You can bet on a steeper decline and your profit should improve dramatically.\n\nLet's assume a dramatic decline of 40% to $330, again within 60 days.\n\nLong $340 March '20 Puts @ 3.85\n\nShort $330 March '20 Puts @ 2.80\n\nCost $1.05 vs $10 payoff, so 852%.
