Buffet will expand his balance sheet whenever he buys out a company, not just write a giant price is right check for billions in cash.  Its the most juvenile understanding of a company out there...and buffet seems to enjoy this impression and fan these flames.  \"Yeah we suck in a bull market, but look at how much money we have! Your money is safe with us!\"\n\nIts all a shrewd viral marketing ploy from buffet, who takes advantage of his fame to change outlooks on whole companies just by investing in a portion of them.  Why else does everyone think he has these wild investor days?  He knows he can no longer return 20% YoY so he uses is name as a brand to pull in more investors.\n\nI'm not a buffet hater or anything, but i do get sick of all the people who invest by \"buffet watching.\"  Its a bad strategy.
