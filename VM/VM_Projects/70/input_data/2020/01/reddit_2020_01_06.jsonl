Volkswagen group for example owns around 12, let’s say 10% of all car sales in the world in 2019. Their market cap is just over $100 billion. With $60 billion in revenue and $4 billion in profits.\n\nThat revenue to market value ratio is low but sustainable. They stopped growing therefore investors seek profits now, which they deliver consistently.\n\nCompared to Tesla right now, with $25 billion yearly revenue and so far still almost no profit and is valued the same. These numbers don’t add up well.\n\nOne, Tesla cars are more expensive in general to buy and have other upgrades like autopilot which bump the revenue per car to be higher than others. Which is great, but not sustainable. We must look at how much profit Tesla will be making with their $40,000 or less cars to get a clearer picture.\n\nTwo, Tesla investors expect great returns even after the company stops growing, as all companies eventually do. So the question is: will Tesla have the profit margins of Apple or of Toyota/VW/Ford when they stop growing? My guess is closer to the auto companies. Because of all the costs associated with manufacturing a car and having to maintain a large amount of infrastructure just to support those cars (repair centers and super chargers). In my metro area I have two Apple stores yet one Tesla repair area, one showroom, and like five super chargers. The Tesla owners still complain of slow service as the area is growing. Building, and eventually maintaining, that infrastructure will lower potential profit margins.\n\nSell super charger network to all car brands: that is new revenue yes but the profits of that must be looked at in comparison to other charging networks. It’s not crazy profits and will require much more investments to accommodate the new use.\n\nTesla Powerwall? That has good profits, especially if it’s used Tesla batteries, however I cannot see widespread use of battery storage.\n\nRobot taxis is the only possible growth sector that I can point to and say “1 trillion.” But not too confidently. Because for that we just must look at UBER. Robo taxi is just UBER without the driver, which resolved to far less costs but also far less revenue as you cannot charge the same as UBER, it must be far less, Elon Musk even said that.\n\nAt most I say a 5x multiple of revenue, above that the company is over valued. So for 1 trillion I expect at least $200 billion in revenue with 20% of that being net profit, aka Apple numbers. Tesla will become a mature company eventually, fast growth forever is impossible, and anything above 10x revenue multiple is unrealistic without much higher than Apple margins.\n\nEDIT: here is a cool chart by industry, look at price/sales ratio.\nhttp://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/psdata.html\n\nSoftware related industries get close to 10x ratio, but that is because they have practically fixed costs with infinite potential revenue.

There’s a lot of talk about how assets like tooling, plants and land are depreciated either by time (For instance land and buildings) vs. by units produced (tooling, robots dies, stamping machines,paint shops...)\n\nSo when they have few units produced early in a ramp, the fixed asset depreciation is spread across fewer units, thus increasing the cost of goods sold.  The tooling and dies have the same effect early in a ramp vs. late in a ramp because there’s a fixed amount of depreciation per unit in a quarter.  \n\nSimple Example:\n\nLand and factory are $2B depreciated over 80 quarters.

Therefore amortization = $2k / Model 3.\n\nParts and Labor = $25k / car\n\nSo automotive cost of revenue in a quarter = Depreciation + Number of cars * (Parts and Labor + Tooling)\n\nTherefore if Tesla produces and sells 1000 Model 3 ‘s in a quarter\n\n-Automotive Cost of revenues = $25M + 1000 * ($35k +$2k) = $62M. ‘ Note how this quarter has to bear $25M in land/building depreciation no matter how many or how few units (even if only 1) are produced.\n\n-Revenue = 1000 * $50k = $50M\n\n-Gross profit = -$12M \n\n-gross margin = -24%\n\nNow assume 10k cars\n\n-Automotive Cost of revenue = $25M + 10k * ($35k + $2k) = $395M\n\n-Revenue = 10k * 50k = $500M\n\n-Gross profit = $500M - $395M = $105M\n\n-Gross margin = +21%\n\nAll of Tesla’s Automotive division costs are put into two buckets\n\n1) Automotive Cost of Revenues (which affect gross profits as described above)\n\n2) Operating Expenses, Which breaks down into:\n\n2.1) R&D\n\n2.2) Selling General and Administration \n\n2.3) Restructuring (cost of layoffs...)\n\nYou can see the breakdown of Operating Expenses and descriptions in the 10Q (and somewhat in the update letter) and clearly none of the Operating Expense descriptions describe factory costs, robots, labor...)\n\nI would also assume this information is covered in GAAP guidelines, Cost of Goods Sold calculation examples...\n\nAs you can see it makes sense.\n\nSome automakers include R&D costs in Automotive Costs of Revenue.
