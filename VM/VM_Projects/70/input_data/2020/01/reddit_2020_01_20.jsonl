{"title": "The forces behind Boeing’s long descent", "selftext": "https://fortune.com/longform/boeing-737-max-crisis-shareholder-first-culture/\n\nThese twin crises, industry insiders say, spring from a culture that consistently put short-term rewards to shareholders ahead of engineering-driven decisions and long-term strategy. For all of Boeing’s business coups and innovation, one stark statistic has come to symbolize the company’s priorities: Over the past six years, Boeing spent $43.4 billion on stock buybacks, compared with $15.7 billion on research and development for commercial airplanes. The board even approved an additional $20 billion buyback in December 2018, less than two months after the first 737 Max crash, though it subsequently shelved that plan. \n\nBut the fallout from the Max crisis may well push Boeing in the opposite direction. Costs related to the Max have topped $9 billion and could easily double. To shore up its balance sheet Boeing is reportedly considering borrowing money to pay shareholder dividends—and cutting R&D spending. Those are steps in the wrong direction, says Epstein. The only way forward is to put investors’ short-term interests on hold, he argues: “If you don’t do that—if you cut R&D, cost-cut, give cash to shareholders—then you’re playing with Boeing’s future.” ", "id": "ercx84", "created_utc": 1579525335.0, "score": 293, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 73, "comments": [{"body": "yes, short term thinking...", "score": 106, "replies": [{"body": "The modern mantra to \"maximize shareholder value\" can often lead to poor long term decisions and toxic corporate cultures.
