{"title": "We Need A Market Correction Soon", "selftext": "Ok hear me out, and before you say it, no I am not a cuck from bear gang trying to desperately justify why I am putting what little money I have left into puts before I get margin called and am forced to selling my ass in a Wendy's parking lot for crack change. \n\nMy idea is this: with the market hitting new ATH and everyone clamoring over each other to long stonks, we are seeing fewer and fewer bears in the market. Why is this bad you ask? Well, who sold you those calls on QQQ at 200? Or TSLA at 420? Who is gonna buy those puts you are selling if all those bears die out? \n\nWith the market going up bigly I can't help but feel that in order for us to see sustained market growth, we need a price correction so that the bears have at least something to feed on before they are forced into the extinction zone called RobinHood margin called. Now, I am not saying that we need to start dumping SPY like BYND back in August. The idea here is to give the bears JUST ENOUGH red to keep them going selling calls and buying puts in order for us to reap the benefits later on when stonks rebound. We don't want to see December 2018 when they were rampant fucking everyone over. \n\nThose are my two cents.\n\nEdit: I am not betting against the market!!
