The karman line is at 62 miles. SPCE can only go to 55 miles. They only \"go to space\" based on one outdated technical definition of \"space\" that only the US recognises.\n\nSuborbital trajectories typically involve taking off from one place on earth, flying into space (but not reaching orbit), then re-entering the atmosphere and landing somewhere else. SPCE don't do this. They fly straight up and come straight back down to the same spot.\n\nSub-orbital international flights aren't possible with current SPCE tech and would require significantly larger hardware to achieve. SPCE aren't developing this hardware, have no such development plans in the pipeline, and even if they did its taken them 16 years just to get their current tech out of the door. Lets also not forget that we aren't talking about a single, one-stage suborbital capable spaceplane here - the SPCE system requires them to design, build and certify **two** aircraft. Anyone expecting them to start operating subortbital international flights this side of 2040 is absolutely kidding themselves, and by then SpaceX and others will have made them completely irrelevant.\n\nBranson himself is a washed up, crusty old fucker who has always operated a scattergun approach to business. His failure rate is astronomical. The only reason he's still rich is thanks to some lucky investments he made in stable sectors in the 90's which have printed consistently. The vast majority of his personal vanity enterprises have folded or been sold for a loss. The suggestion he's the British equivalent of Elon Musk is fucking *hilarious*.\n\nIn summary, all SPCE have to offer are expensive, high altitude balloon rides that cater to the insta accounts of rich people.
