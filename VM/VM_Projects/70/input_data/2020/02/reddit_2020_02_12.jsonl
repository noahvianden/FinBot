In testimony before the Senate Banking Committee, Powell said the Fed had two recession-fighting tools; buying government bonds, known as QE, and communicating clearly with markets about interest-rate policy, routinely considered as &quot;Forward guidance.\"\n\n> The Fed has traditionally been able to slash interest rates to fight a recession often by as much as 5 percentage points.\n\n> As a result, once the Fed trims rates close to zero, if it does, &quot;It is much more likely we will have to turn to the tools we used in the financial crisis,&quot; namely asset purchases and forward guidance, Powell said.\n\n\n*****\n[**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/f2v7zw/powell_says_fed_will_aggressively_use_qe_to_fight/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ \"Version 2.02, ~467790 tl;drs so far.\") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr \"PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome.\") | *Top* *keywords*: **Powell**^#1 **rate**^#2 **Fed**^#3 **tool**^#4 **much**^#5", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "So does that mean we don’t have to keep calling it “not QE?”", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "No it means we can have both.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Genius", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "China markets affecting the U.S?
