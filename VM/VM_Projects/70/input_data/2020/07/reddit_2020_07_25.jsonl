Revenues have been boosted by pent up demand, competitor closures and stimulus money. Brick-and-mortar same-store sales are expected to grow 60% and online sales are forecast to jump 200%. Most significant for future growth is Hibbett has been winning new customers with 25% of brick-and-mortar sales and 40% of online sales coming from new shoppers.\n\nHome builder **PulteGroup** $PHM (trailing PE 10.04) reported a remarkable rebound in demand as net new orders increased 50% in June.  Home buyers, typically on higher incomes, appear to be less affected by COVID than the average and lower paid general public and, coupled with a “very limited supply of existing housing stock”, are driving a recovery in the housing market that are boosting home builders.   PulteGroup’s CEO said the recovery in new home demand “was nothing short of outstanding.”  New home construction jumped 17% and builder confidence rose to pre-pandemic levels after plunging in April. \n\nPulteGroup’s smaller peer **Meritage Homes** $MTH (trailing PE 10.59) reported a much bigger increase with a 32% jump in orders in the second quarter, 78% increase in net earnings, 20% revenue growth and strong margin improvement.   Steven J. Hilton, $MTH chairman and chief executive officer said “Based on our current forecast, we believe we can generate between $4.0-4.3 billion in home closing revenue for the year, including $1.0-1.1 billion for the third quarter, with home closing gross margins around 21% for the third quarter and full year. We estimate that will translate to approximately $8.75-9.25 of diluted earnings per share for the full year,”. **Thats 36% higher than consensus forecasts.**\n\n**Whirlpool** $WHR (trailing PE 12.03) beat expectations with Q2 EPS of $2.15 (compared to estimates for 96 cents) and sales of $4 billion (estimates $3.6 billion).  Both figures were down year-over-year, but the company pointed to “significant Covid-19 related disruptions.”  CEO Marc Bitzer pointed to decisive actions and the resilence of Whirlpool’s business model while CFO Jim Peters highlighted the “solid cost takeout globally and strong cash flow improvement through disciplined working capital management,”.\n\n**Skechers** $SKX (trailing PE 13.44) reported an earnings beat on Thursday and said “Despite the challenges of the second quarter, we are optimistic about the early-stage recovery we are seeing in much of our business, including... the explosive growth of our e-commerce channel,”.  Remarkably the company was able to grow cash balances by more than $175 million during the quarter through working capital and operating expense management.  As a result net cash accounts for about 20% of Skecher’s valuation.\n\nFinally, with **eBay** (2020f PE 15.70) $EBAY due to report Q2 results on Monday,  A Barron’s article said the stock was a buy with analysts (such as Edward Yruma  at KeyBanc Capital Markets) expecting 23% to 26% growth as new sellers, consumer-facing improvements, and new payment options providing long-term tailwinds for the business. ” Yruma thinks eBay has regained lost market share during the Covid-19 pandemic and eventually should grow at rates exceeding overall e-commerce growth “as it both improves its consumer offering and takes advantage of stronger secular trends.” That means, primarily, that marketplace participants are increasingly realizing the importance of selling on multiple platforms.  Trading on just 16x current year estimates, the valuation does look attractive.\n\nThis is not a recommendation to buy or sell.  Stocks are not suitable for everyone.

Monday patterns below!\n\n-Mondays \nLast 8/10-green— 3/3 100% following red Friday \n\nSince March 15/24-Green—8/10 80% following a red Friday\n\n3 red days in a row. June 9-11 -6.8%, may 11-13 -4%, March 5-6,9th -12.3%. 3rd red days Opened 3 points down, opened 13 points down, opened 48 points down.\n\n-Though, this is what happens before a significant pull back after a run! Big boys make choppy waters as they sell off profits and retail holds their bags. Example for retards- you own 10% of $100 stock now at $200. You want to take all profits at top vs $190-$200 area so you unload slowly while it bounces back through highs. This also crushes theta and Vix to make cheaper premiums for your put options plays. This is currently happening no matter whatever side you are pulling for and will result in a transition to a bear market!\n\n-So as a bear now I recognize the boring stuff like I hate that we bounced off 3193 support again Friday with what I felt was never significant pressure. As long as we stay above there then no significant fall will happen. We didn’t have a covering pump Friday which opens up a short squeeze opportunity. Economy is screwed and free money is drying up.
