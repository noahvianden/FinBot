The relationship for the purpose of meeting the requirement is direct. You will see that news articles on the day of when Tesla announcing their profitability, use this interchangeably.\n\nAlso, I am an accountant, so I know how it works, and I have read the requirements for S&P inclusion, have you?

Tesla will most likely not be effected this quarter in a material way but it is not a 1:1 equivalence.\n\nLastly news articles might state \"EPS was XYZ which qualifies Tesla for s&p inclusion\". This would be accurate for the scenario but not the general rule. \n\nTo put it simply, a positive EPS is a guarantee of positive net earnings, but positive net earnings are not a guarantee of positive EPS. This also means that a zero (or negative) EPS could still be a positive earning and qualify for inclusion.

On the other hand, labor was furloughed for half the quarter, so Tesla did not have to pay the 10k workers working at Fremont for that period of time.\n\nA fair amount of cars sold this quarter were actually inventory cars from Q1, and will  not be affected by any of this. When a car is built in Q1, the costs of that car get determined at that point in time, even if it is sold in Q2 or Q3. So we're talking about non-inventory S+X, non-inventory M3, and MY here.\n\nI increased the COGS of S+X slightly by $500 to hopefully account for this. Fremont M3 COGS I've kept the same, because I think they would've come down otherwise thanks to MY adding more scale. As for the MY, it's hard to estimate its gross margin to begin with at this point in time, but because they're only selling LR and P versions at the moment, margins should be fairly high.
