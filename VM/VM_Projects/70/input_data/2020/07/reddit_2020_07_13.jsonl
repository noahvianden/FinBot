And retail doesn't have enough buying power to cover the gap.\n\nSome of it could be money flowing out of bonds into equities as funds rebalance too.

However, since interest rates are effectively zero that channel wa broken since 2008, so Fed decided to allow other forms of collaterals with m2 purposes: swallow the bad mortgage securities and loosen credit constraints so banks would loan. As you can see, the goal of the repo is increase investments via cheaper credit but the economic downturn we are experiencing isn‚Äôt a result of a supply shock that can be alleviated with cheap credit, it is the collapse of demand. Thus, the effect of the extra liquidity to banks should not be translating to any economic benefit as firms would not be looking to increase investments. \n\nNow, it is possible that corporations are using the cheap credit to get loans to cover other sort of expenses (this years already has a record breaking corporate debt issuance) and that could be bringing their stock prices up as cash on hand improves. However, this is problematic since the new debt isn‚Äôt being use to increase productivity or future business income and therefore the balance sheets would be worst in the near future.
