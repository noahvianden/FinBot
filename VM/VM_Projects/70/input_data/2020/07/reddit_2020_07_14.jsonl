For calls do call spreads and puts do put spreads. Would also say debit spread over credit spread. \n\nAs for problems I havenâ€™t had any issues selling yet. \n\nFor a call debit spread you buy a call for stock x say 500c and it costs $4 and you then write a call at a higher value. Say 510c where they give you $2 for writing. \n\nYou can now buy a 500/510 spread where the cost is the difference in price so 4-2=$2*100 $200\n\n but the max gain is the difference in the calls so if the stock hits 510 youâ€™ll make $1000 minus the buy in of $200. For $800 profit \n\nThe difference with spreads is they make a lot of there money the closer you get to expiration because the $$ is the difference between the 2 call prices so this increases over time because theta decreases. \n\nUse the calculator pick a stock and mess around to see the results.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "ive discovered that site yesterday and its amazing. ill look into this thank you.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "I have 3 calls for 590 8/3 exp", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Personally, Iâ€™d bail.

On Jun 26, it's a big red candle, Jun 29 sees a tiny bar with a long bottoming tail. Jun 30, price goes up to almost midway of Jun 26's range and on July, one ultra bull dildo.\n\nReflect that on the last few days: Yesterday is huge red candle, today has long bottoming tail... meaning if tomorrow is positive bringing price to the 530-550 zone, Thursday will give us an **ultra bull dildo**; NFLX should hit 600-620 easily before before 4pm earnings.\n\nFollowing that, IF the pattern continues, then NFLX will beat earnings, but price still drop. Somewhere between ultra dildo tip and red candle top... So, my target time to sell, is near Thursday close, before earnings release.\n\n\\---\n\nHowever, if things don't go as planned, means the pattern is broken. NFLX will still beat earnings (this is pretty much a given) and it will soar... how high... I don't know... but I'll wear my Titanium gauntlets and hold my call through earnings. Friday after lunch, people goes into weekend mood, so the day's high cannot be afternoon... my ideal time to sell is Friday around 10-11am.\n\n\\---\n\nPlease do your own DD. This prediction is purely personal opinion and not financial advice.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Price didn't hit target today, closing 523, which is a distance away from my 535 minimum target. This means tomorrow's prediction is skewed, i.e. the bull dildo may not be as meaty as expected.\n\nBut there is good news: Another analyst gave a new target price of 575.\n\nOverall, earnings of hyped stocks are basically \"double or nothing\" bets. Expect large movements in either side. It's no longer about beating earnings, because everyone and their grandma knows NFLX will beat. It'll be beating expectations of investors. \n\nExpectations cannot be measured, some people think Tesla is valued at 5000, others think 800 is overpriced... which makes holding into earnings very risky.\n\n---\n\nAs the saying goes: \"Hope for the best, prepare for the worst.\" \n\nBest case earning results is NFLX going to the moon. \n\nWorst case scenario: Lose everything you've put on the table.\n\n--- \n\nNetflix currently has an IV spike due to both earnings and erratic price movement the last few days. Those who've recovered or isn't down as much, you may want to consider cashing out tomorrow. Small loss/profit is better than all gone. You can keep runners (something you don't mind losing), so as not to miss out.\n\nAs a side note, option prices will drop drastically on Friday due to IV crush (google it if you don't know). Play safe, sell on Thursday, for Friday will be risky.\n\n--- \n\nHere are some tips and tricks for those with calls expiring 7/17\n\nAssuming the price spikes up, sell early.\n\nOTM options with 0 days to expiry, noon is the cut-off time. Sell before 11 am or you will see their prices plummet extremely fast. A 5.00 value in the morning go to 0.50 after lunch, even if the price didn't move.\n\nFor ITM options, you can wait, but I personally still suggest finding a good price and sell before noon. Unless you know how to read intraday charts and know the price will go up in the afternoon, the longer you hold, the more risky it becomes.\n\nOnce you sell, don't look back. We have all seen on Monday, how prices can start out strong then suddenly drop like a rock. I believe people reading this knows the feeling of having a winner turned loser. If the price looks good, sell, and don't look back.\n\nObviously, it can become like today, where prices can start out strong, drop for a while then recover to go higher... Personally, if the price spiked after earnings, wishing for another, on the same day, is too greedy. Also, I rather joke on WSB about having paper hands with profits locked in, then cry about iron hands with empty pockets.", "score": 4, "replies": []}, {"body": "Following this.  I'm with you guys.
