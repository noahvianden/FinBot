I just have my doubts about profitability when they're outsourcing all of the heavy lifting to other companies. The only way Tesla has managed to get their vehicles sold profitably is through massive vertical integration and building custom parts in house. \n\nOther automakers have been trying and failing to build paint by numbers electric cars with off the shelf parts and they can neither get costs down or performance up compared to Tesla. Even if Bosch is throwing engineering talent at it Bosch has to charge Nikola a premium on top of labor. Start to apply this to the fact that they aren't really doing much if anything in house from what it looks like. Then consider the massive upfront costs of building a hydrogen fueling network. Even Tesla, who owns solar panel manufacturing, is having difficulty getting enough solar panels up to power their factories let alone their supercharger network and you have Milton claiming that their entire network will be solar powered to allow for clean electrolysis to make all that hydrogen.
