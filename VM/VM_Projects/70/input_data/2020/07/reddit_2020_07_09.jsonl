At this point in 2009, the S&P 500 was up just        32.3% from its lows.)     \n\n^(Colas said the S&P has attempted to break out ahead of its 2009 recovery        pace twice already in 2020 in late March and in early June, and it        quickly regressed both times.)     \n\n### Stages Of Recovery \n\n^(Colas said the reasons why the 2009 and 2020 recoveries have been so        similar is because there are philosophical underpinnings related to        investor behavior following market crises. These underpinnings create        two phases in the market.)     \n\n^(The first phase lasts around 60 days and coincides with investors        understanding that fiscal and monetary stimulus from the government are        sufficient to stave off the crisis itself. The second phase lasts about        30 days and coincides with investors waiting for fundamental evidence        and guidance corroborating that the bottom in corporate earnings is        actually in.)     \n\n**^(One key difference between the 2009 recovery and the 2020        recovery is market leadership.)** ^(In 2009, bank stocks led the        recovery, whereas tech stocks are the market leaders in 2020. Colas said        second-quarter tech stock earnings could go a long way in determining        whether or not the recent rally has gone too far too fast.)     \n\n^(‚ÄúJust as no one believed the banks had bottomed in March 2009, there is        now/still a very real reluctance to embrace the idea that Big Tech has        not just survived the COVID Crisis but 1) actually thrived and 2) is        best positioned of all sectors to grow post-COVID,‚Äù Colas wrote.)     \n\n### Benzinga‚Äôs Take \n\n^(Given analysts are expecting mostly horrendous earnings numbers in the        second quarter, the) **^(SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust)** ^((NYSE:)[^(SPY)](http://www.benzinga.com/stock/SPY#NYSE)^()        seems to be pricing in some high expectations for guidance in the second        half of 2020 and into 2021.)     \n\n^(If the recent spike in COVID-19 cases in certain regions of the U.S.        weighs on those expectations or delays a potential recovery, the S&P 500        could easily once again fall back in-line with the 2009 playbook.)", "id": "ho8n6g", "created_utc": 1594320043.0, "score": 25, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "num_comments": 75, "comments": [{"body": "This supports my opinion which was originally formed using zero data so therefore I upvote", "score": 60, "replies": [{"body": "This is the way", "score": 20, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Itll fall 30% by September", "score": 19, "replies": [{"body": "I‚Äôm going with a 10-20% pullback. 30% will be welcome", "score": 18, "replies": [{"body": "I've noticed you've been a gay bear with me for some time.
