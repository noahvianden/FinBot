{"title": "$F", "selftext": "Ford is announcing the new Bronco soon. While the 2021 F-150 release was just a mild refresh of the current generation (with slightly better styling imo), the Bronco will eat into the market share of the Wrangler, which is wildly popular and basically unchallenged. I think this catalyst could push for a MACD cross on the 1 month chart. Also, with EV's being so hot right now, in the fall, they are releasing the Mach E. The Mach E undercuts the Model Y by $10k, and we all know that with EV's, it's going to be a race to the bottom in terms of price. Ford has the experience and production capabilities to make a lot more EV's than Tesla, and I suspect fewer quality control issues to plague the vehicles than the early Tesla's. It's been a common sentiment I have been seeing that $TSLA is \"too high imo\" in comparison to other auto manufacturers with way more revenue, but I think that perhaps other vehicle manufacturers are undervalued, and the release of new EV's (particularly crossover-sized vehicles) will make the market realize this. Or maybe I'm wrong and electric cars are going to be a boutique luxury item for quite a bit longer. Either way, I suspect people are going to be trepidatious to travel by plane for a bit longer, and perhaps turn to more long distance car travel.

{"title": "Just a little eBay DD (Repeat of FedEx?)", "selftext": "To start I have been a seller on eBay since 2018 and just become a \"Top Seller\" last month (highest ranked seller on eBay).   I experienced many oddities that I never have seen/had on eBay and am confident this is the closest thing to Insider Info you are going to get.\n\n**Company Background Info**:  eBay has been around since 1995 and used to be an auction site.  Over the last decade it has been transitioning into a large wholesale and warehouse style business similar to Amazon (only with auctions as an option for sellers).  eBay works very closely with Paypal and has been since 2002.  Together eBay collects an average of 10% and Paypal collects 2.5% of every sale sitewide.  At the start of this year eBay began rolling out a program similar to Paypal (or other online transactors) for sellers to test, so they have that going for them too.\n\n**Sales Spike**: Back in March/April when everything locked down eBay was flooded with new buyers like I had never seen before.  During this a few of the days their was so much traffic the site couldn't handle it and crashed multiple times.  eBay has been lagging in online sales over the years because of competitors like Amazon and Shopify, but during the pandemic entire sectors were cleaned out of items similar to Amazon.  Many Top Sellers myself included had our inventories cleaned out as demand increased.  Random items selling like crazy especially after people started to get their Trump Bucks.  The last year and in Q1 2020 eBay GMV (Gross Merchandise Volume) have been down between 6-9% (depending on where you look) so this earnings report percentage increase will be very dramatic for the company.  Since the start of April, GMV has grown more than 20% week over week (said by executives so probably around 5-10% which is still a lot for the site being down 9).\n\n**Sellers Getting Big Benefits to Sell:** In case you didn't know on eBay you cannot just sell 1000 items in you store (not without paying a bunch of fees).  You start with 10 free listings and work your way up (many stores sit around the 100 or 200 free range).  During the lockdowns eBay allowed for anyone who had a store to sell 100,000 for April and May which is still going on as a 50,000 offer right now ending in August (but will probably extend to the fall).  They also set up a program for small mom and pop businesses and stores in specific categories to be featured on the home page of eBay daily to help them.  New eBay stores would not have to pay the monthly fee (we all pay to have store status, which varies based on what services you want starting at $4.95 a month) for three months and immediately had access to 500 listings.  They also deferred fees for certain stores (not mine unfortunately) for the month of April, and offered 100% seller protection on delayed shipping or fraudulent buyers.\n\n**FedEx/USPS**: FedEx, Ups, and USPS were overrun in April to the point where they had temp job openings at one point.  This was due to the virus sending some of their staff home and the large flux of online sales.  One of the reasons eBay allowed sellers to ship late was because of these delays.  FedEx is a partner of eBay as well and the pair offer very generous discounts on shipping for eBay sellers, so I believe the surge in eBay sales may have helped FedEx's earnings (I certainly paid them a lot this year).\n\nOverall I am aware eBay has been on the decline the last few years, but I believe this year could be the turnaround.  The stock is at an ATH so tread lightly but I believe this earnings run up could be pretty significant.  My target estimate is $65 but I could see it getting up to $70 if their sales for Q2 bring their yearly sales up 10%+ people thought eBay was dying last year so this surge could get people taking them seriously again.\n\nIf you want to read up on eBay and see were 1/4 of my information is from: [https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/article/ebays-sales/](https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/article/ebays-sales/)\n\nTLDR: eBay stonk will go up before earnings who knows after that.\n\nEBAY 60c 7/17\n\nEDIT: EBAY EARNINGS PUSHED TO 7/28", "id": "hn5f6e", "created_utc": 1594163533.0, "score": 62, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 72, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 30, "replies": [{"body": "Funniest thing about this is that Stubhub is now practically worthless due to Covid.
