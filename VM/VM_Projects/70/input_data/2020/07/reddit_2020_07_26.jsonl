{"title": "Anyone purchased into Pershing Squareâ€™s PTSHU?", "selftext": "Bought 99 units at $21.75 on Fidelity. \n\nFYI, PTSHU is a SPAC (co-)founded by Bill Ackman, which some would say helped pushed the COVID crash a few additional percents down when he went onto CNBC and gave an emotional speech about his father, Trump, and the economy. \n\nNews came out, few weeks later that he made over 2 billion after betting against the market (~$25 mill bet) a few days after his CNBC interview. \n\nA few rumors: they are dancing to acquire/merge with a multi-billion dollar company to IPO. A few choices can be: AirBnB, CoinBase. \n\nThoughts on this? And the big thing... PTSH wonâ€™t be avail on RH yet (something about 52 days or something from date of SPAC offering July 2X).
