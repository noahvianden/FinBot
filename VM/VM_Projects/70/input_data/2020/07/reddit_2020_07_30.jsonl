{"title": "U.S. G.D.P. Fell 9.5 Percent", "selftext": "\nEconomic output fell at its fastest pace on record last spring as the coronavirus pandemic forced businesses across the United States to close their doors and kept millions of Americans shut in their homes for weeks.\n\nGross domestic product — the broadest measure of goods and services produced — fell 9.5 percent in the second quarter of the year, the Commerce Department said Thursday. On an annualized basis, the standard way of reporting quarterly economic data, G.D.P. fell at a rate of 32.9 percent.\n\nThe collapse was unprecedented in its speed and breathtaking in its severity. The only possible comparisons in modern American history came during the Great Depression and the demobilization after World War II, both of which occurred before the advent of modern economic statistics.\n\nUnlike past recessions, this one was a result of a conscious decision to suspend economic activity to slow the spread of the virus. Congress pumped trillions of dollars into the economy to sustain households and businesses, limit long-term damage and allow for a rapid rebound.\n\nThe plan worked at first. In recent weeks, however, cases have surged in much of the country. Data from public and private sources indicate a pullback in economic activity, reflecting consumer unease and renewed shutdowns.\n\n“In another world, a sharp drop in activity would have been just a good, necessary blip while we addressed the virus,”said Heather Boushey, president of the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, a progressive think tank. “From where we sit in July, we know that this wasn’t just a short-term blip.”\n\n\nThe number of Americans filing new claims for state unemployment benefits totaled 1.43 million last week, the Labor Department reported Thursday.\n\nIt was the 19th straight week that the tally exceeded one million, an unheard-of figure before the coronavirus pandemic. And it was the second weekly increase in a row after nearly four months of declines, a sign of how the rebound in cases has undercut the economy’s nascent recovery. Claims for the previous week totaled 1.42 million.\n\nNew claims for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, the government’s program aimed at covering freelancers, the self-employed and other workers not covered by traditional unemployment benefits, totaled 830,000. That number, unlike the figure for state claims, is not seasonally adjusted.", "id": "i0lmys", "created_utc": 1596114094.0, "score": 37, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 74, "comments": [{"body": "And while our elected representatives can agree that they want to send checks to everyone employed or not, they can’t agree how to help the tens of millions that are out of work.

Her expenses are negligible, so the $5k after taxes every month is mostly spending money.  \n\nIf you already have a strong reputation in your chosen profession, and she does, this does very little damage to your resume or future job prospects. She will get hired as soon as she wants to be employed. I have a few friends in the restaurant/bar industry that are in exactly the same situation; they could get a job within 24 hours if they wanted one, but right now it isn't worth it to them because they are getting paid enough money to support their normal lifestyle. If that bonus $600/wk disappears, I think you'll be shocked at how quickly the unemployment rate drops.\n\nI'm over-employed right now (working two high-paying jobs, though I don't need the money) but I kind of wish I wasn't so I could hang out with my unemployed friends and girlfriend.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Yea I guess everyone's situation is different. \n\nI worked 2 jobs prior to the pandemic, 1 bartending and one in logistics which was a career path.

So I think there would be a push for low income ppl to get a new job, but ppl in my situation arent going to go back to work and risk exposure for an extra $1/2 an hr and that would personally make my resume look worse taking on a job like that. \n\nSo the only difference that $600 makes in my situation is spending. With the 600 I am able to support local businesses and buy some luxuries I normally wouldn't. Take that away and I am just going into savings mode, eating rice/beans until the pandemic blows over. \n\nSo not every situation is the same, but if that 600 is cut too much then I would expect a ton of local restaurants and other establishments to suffer. \n\nIt doesnt make sense to me at least to have the economy mostly shut down AND get rid of that because the jobs that I would normally take and would provide enough to support me just arent being offered right now.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "Sure but we’re just talking about obvious fast solutions.
