Buying and selling ETF's works through the same interface as buying individual stocks.  In many ways they are the perfect \"learn to invest\" choice.\n\nWe already covered how they buy and sell the same as individual stocks like apple.  Learning how to open an account, deposit money into it and order a trade are important skill and ETF's will still allow you to do this.\n\nThey are safe.  An ETF like QQQ represents a broad category of interests, in this case American computer tech. QQQ is a bundle of companies like Google, Apple and Microsoft.  It's safer because there is essentially no risk of losing your money.  It's possible Apple or Microsoft could have something catastrophic happen to them and collapse but the odds of that happening to all of those companies at once is functionally impossible.\n\nTIME!!!  Investing early is a very very good idea, but and $1000 is enough money to make it worth while, but you do not want to spend hours every day reading the news and scrutinizing your portfolio.  If you make AMAZING gains and average +20% per year but spend 100's of hours doing it, then you are going to be making about $2 and hour.  That's your best case scenario, and you'd still be better off spending that time at a part time job.  An ETF is more \"fire and forget\" you can buy it, and check it a couple times a year and not have to worry.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for the input.

The stocks you mentioned are very high right now.  If they come down it could take months for them to hit these highs again.  Find strong performing stocks that are beat up right now, like gas (Chevron or a gas ETF) or Airlines (not American airlines).\n\nCommit your summers to trading for a couple hours a couple days a week.  ETF's or stocks with a stop loss advance sale orders during the school year.  Short term traders buy one stock at a time and they watch it or set up alerts and check it.  They can start at 7 am, 9:30 am. or 3 pm.   Do research the day before the sale to make a plan and then check the news in the am before your start time to be sure all systems are a go.  Big news can derail your plan.  Practice on the real market with paper money on think or swim until you are succeeding a lot and feel confident.  Then start taking risks.\n\nPut a flyer in the mailbox of every house on your street saying you are willing to help with odd jobs, landscaping projects, moving, cleaning.  Talk to your parents about reasonable limits on how many hours to work.  Learn to use basic tools and then you can list helping with small reno projects like putting up a fence.  Every early invested dollar is worth 20 bucks invested late. Or learn ot do some coding.  People who can do coding to modify think or swim scans to an investors needs are listed on Fivver and charging $25 bucks per scan.\n\nIf you learn how to make conditional sales and get good at predicting when the stock will start to fall, you will have more freedom from being tied to the monitor screen.  Don't rush yourself to trade much now.  Buy some beat up bargain Blue chips and your money will multiply quickly upon recovery.  Soon as the vaccines come out/elections over, Airlines/gas should rebound.  Check the pre-virus prices on them compared to the pre virus price on Microsoft and Apple.  Notice how many more shares you can buy and the potential sale price once they bounce back.  Use the analyze tab on Think or Swim to read about the different airlines/gas companies before you buy one. Check some other websites too before buying. Trading is about good research as much as it is about buying low and understanding the stock chart.  Never buy at the top of the price channel.  Wait for the dip.  There is always a dip. Sometimes many!\n\nOnce you make a nice profit on these stocks and the price has come down some on tech, You can move your winnings into tech.  That will give you time to research the tech field and pick a stock with the best out look, using the analyze tab and reading what analysts are saying.  Tech is artificially high now due to he virus and will likely come down some.   Practice before you trade short term.  Learn more first.  A basic understanding can be just enough to be dangerous.  2-3 months of practice first.   By next summer you will be a total whiz kid and maybe even retire before your parents do!!!!\n\nBring up a 1 year chart on Microsoft or Apple.  Look at what the price was a year ago and then what it is now.  Imagine you bought 5 shares a year ago.  If you sold them now what would be your gain.  (5 times the difference in price),  Now go through the year and imagine that you bought and sold twice a week. Total the difference in price from 9:30 am till the first big peak starts to fall on each of the two days.  Now do that for a month and then multiply that times 12.  See what your profits would have been short term investing twice a week compared to the year.  It will probably be much higher even with the high inflated prices due to the virus.  Make it a goal to learn how to scalp like that by next summer.  Remember the stop loss and you wont loose much before it automatically sells off.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit:\n\nPS.  If you explore the on demand and think back features on think or Swim (TOS) u can place fake trades but on a fake copy of the real market but on your schedule so you can play today's market but at 7 tonight after chores/homework.  If you screw up you can start it over and do it differently.  \n\nLearn the timing of the market. This is very important.

Just consider much of what happens there as one big paid commercial.  \n\nWhen you are counting up the gains form your two day a week short term trade I suggested above, don't pick Fridays as a day you count.

You are clearly an exceptional person!  \n\nBut the idea of putting the money in and ignoring it for 4 years is not such a great idea.  There are no \"safe\" stocks.  You picked what are today some very strong performers but the market is a constantly changing environment.  It operates on trends.  Trends are guaranteed to change. Think about what was trendy in fashion 5 years ago.  Is it still the hotest thing?  \n\nImagine u buy Microsoft and next week a new computer comes out that is twice as intuitive and safe from viruses.  You don't hear about it for a day or two and by then your 4 shares are worth half the value you put in. Or imagine that tomorrow it's proven that Bill Gates is a pedophile (rumors exist already). That his philanthropic work is really cover for social engineering. That the lawsuits in Africa/India that claim he used their children as guinea pigs without getting parent's informed consent are true and resulted in recklessly crippling 50,000 children.  Imagine that its accepted as fact that Microsoft products all have back doors where all your data is gathered and sold.  Imagine that it is Microsoft itself that creates the viruses that often kill computers and steal data.  It wont be the end of the world.  The company will oust him and reform and perhaps they recover. And perhaps they don't and the industry moves on to new companies without the baggage.  You're money will loose at least half it value, unless you learned how to set up a stop loss sale in advance.  Then it will loose 2% of its value.  \n\nMy suggestion to you is instead of just throwing money in the market, to learn how to manage stocks.  You can do this for 0 dollars.  Open yourself a free think or swim account.  Then start watching some free introductory videos on Youtube or the learning center on TD ameritrade, or E-trade.  Every time they say a word you don't understand, google it.  Look at how young many of the people making videos on how to make money in the market are.  Once you feel like you have the lingo and the basics of reading a chart and patterns in the chart, make your way over to live traders on Youtube.  Listen and learn.  Explore the many options for trading on the market.  \n\nThen go back to think or swim and set it to trade with paper (fake) money only.  Set it up to trade with the amount of money you actually have to trade, not some fantasy account.  Different strategies work with different dollar amounts.  No good learning how to make money with the account you want, not the account you actually have.  Listen to the news/ social media pick a stock you think will be a winner and watch it for a few hours.  Do that a dozen times.  When you think you are making money on most trades, then you are ready to take your nest egg and actually trade with it.  Aim to make 5-10 maybe even 20 bucks a trade.  Add money to the account every month u can from your income. \n\nIf you will put about 25 hours into learning the market, that will be worth sooo much more than any profit you can make off your nest egg.  Information is power. It reduces fear.  Most people are afraid of the market so they throw their money in and let others manage it poorly.  Information makes the market a tool you can use for the rest of your life to make money.  Long term investing isn't very profitable unless you have a lot to put in and time to wait.  Short term can grow a little into a lot.   Just putting money in and forgetting it is like spinning the roulette wheel.  If that worked, everyone would do it.  Sorry.  I think folks here are being over optimistic for you cause of your age.  I think the truth sets u up for success and polyanna crap sets you up for disillusionment.  \n\nIf you really want to just put the money in and forget it for years, then I think you need ETF's. \n\nWhile you are learning grow that investment amount.  1000 is great but, profits will be very small.  Microsoft today started trading at 206.82 and spiked to 210.82.  So you can buy 4 shares and even if you bought it before it spiked and sold it near the high, you would make 16 dollars.  But that 16 dollars is better than the  dollars you would make if you put the money in and it goes up 10 and then down 5 over and over.  At the end of the year you might gain 20 dollars over all.  If you buy and sell repeatedly 15 turns into 150.  You can learn how to set up advance sell orders so it sells \n\nAgain, I applaud your foresight, intelligence, and intention.  Now show me courage, a willingness to work to get what you want and the maturity to deal with reality to overcome obstacles.  I believe if you will apply yourself, be  disciplined, patient and courageous your little pile will surpass my big pile in time. \n\nHere's to you!  It will be fun!

Someone then told me about Theta Gang, and the theta gang podcast, I listened to every podcast and was super intrigued, and was basically told I was an idiot for trying to day trade off some random dude's signals..

It seems almost every time I set up a trade, some sort of crash comes entirely wiping out the underlying, and leaving my trades to expire worthless.

COD mobile became much more of a blockbuster than expected, really quickly, which has driven appreciation in the share price since last year.
