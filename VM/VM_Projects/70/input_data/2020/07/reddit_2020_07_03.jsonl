Anyone with an Internet connection could buy stocks from an online discount broker.  Technology stocks were on fire and small, inexperienced individual investors were piling in.  It ended in tears.\n\nAnother parallel to the late 1990's is the liquidity provided by the Fed.  We were staring down the Y2K glitch and there was concern that some large % of computer systems world wide would crash on 1/1/2000.  The Fed pumped alot of $ during late 1999 which provided the fuel for final tech rally into March 2000.\n\nWhat we are seeing now is several orders of magnitude higher than what we saw in 1999.  Both more small, inexperienced traders and way more liquidity pumped by the fed.  \n\nDon't take any of this post as a prediction.  How the hell would I know what is going to happen in the future?
