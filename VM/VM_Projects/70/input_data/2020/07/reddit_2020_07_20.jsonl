{"title": "Shipping by Tesla or Nikola Trucks would be Many Times as Expensive as Diesel Trucks for at Least 10-20 Years", "selftext": "An electric drivetrain should be lighter than a diesel truck. Tesla batteries are heavy, though! A Tesla model S has a GVW OF 4700 lbs, including 1200 lbs of batteries to go 373 miles. Assuming everything is proportional just for the back-of-the-napkin calculation, that means each pound of battery can haul 1 pound for 1,461 miles. (4700gvwlbs/1200lbsbattery*373miles)\nSo to haul 80,000 lbs for 500 miles, you would need 27,378 lbs of battery. (80,000GVW lbs * 500 miles / 1461 lbmiles) \n\nSo with 27,400 lbs already used on batteries, that leaves us with 52,600 lbs for the load, the truck, and the trailer. The empty vehicle weight of a regular diesel semi is about 25,000 lbs. \n\nSo with the same tech as a Model S, a Tesla Semi would only have a payload of 28,000 lbs, or half of the payload of a regular diesel semi,  if it had a range of 500 miles, since to legally travel on American highways it needs to have a GVW of 80,000 lb or less.\n\nI know electric will win in the long haul (pun intended) but the battery tech is what has been holding it back for over 100 years. Pound for pound you just can't beat diesel. 1400 lbs of diesel will give a semi a range of well over 1,000 miles! The only source of fuel more efficient, weight wise, I think would be a nuclear reactor\n\nIt could still be cheaper to haul the payload, so it could still be valuable tech? Even with the smaller payload electricity is a lot cheaper than diesel. Some quick math:\n\nAssuming a cost of $0.12 per kwh, it costs $8.62 to charge the 1200 lbs of batteries on the Model S. It would cost $194 to recharge 27,000 lbs of Tesla Semi batteries. \n\nSo payload on regular truck 52,000 lb, getting 6.5 miles per gallon, going 500 miles, uses 77 gallons of diesel, which right now is about $2.40 a gallon - so it costs $184 for a regular Diesel Semi to haul 52,000 lbs 500 miles, and it costs the Tesla Semi $194 to haul 28,000 lbs 500 miles. \n\nSo actually, it costs $0.0035 to ship a pound 500 miles by diesel ($184/52,000lbs) and it costs $0.0069 to ship a pound 500 miles by Tesla Semi. So it costs 100% more to ship by Tesla, not even including the fact that you'd need to buy two trucks to ship the same amount of product, which increases the per mile cost!!!!\n\nWhere Tesla wins though, is dramatically lower maintenance costs. Reports of Teslas are that they are dramatically cheaper when it comes to maintenance. \n\nStill though, pound for pound and mile for mile, diesel has electric beat by 100%\n\nNikola is betting on hydrogen fuel cell trucks. Hydrogen has about the same amount of energy by weight as diesel. But hydrogen costs $14/kg, and diesel costs $0.75/kg. So hydrogen is almost 20x as expensive as diesel.\n\nNikola is betting that the cost of hydrogen will drop significantly in the future but there are lower limits on how cheap hydrogen can be. Hydrogen is produced via electrolysis, which takes electricity. It takes 39 kWh to make 1kg of hydrogen. At 12¢ per kWh, that's $4.68 per kg of hydrogen and that's just the energy to make it, not store it and ship it. So the cost of just the electricity needed to make hydrogen is over 6x as expensive as the same amount of diesel at the pump, with all the storage and transportation costs included.\n\nThis makes sense - the energy to make diesel came from the sun millions of years ago, no energy is required to \"make\" a fossil fuel, only to refine it. In the case of hydrogen, you have to do the work and expend energy to make the fuel. This make it inherently more expensive. \n\n For hydrogen to compete with diesel in shipping, electricity needs to get at least 6 times cheaper or for diesel to get 6x more expensive. And that's just the bare minimum - you also have to pay for the hydrogen storage and shipping - an entire new global infrastructure.\n\nThe only way these companies make sense in the short term is if voters make the cost of emitting carbon more expensive than the increased costs of shipping by hydrogen fuel cell or battery, by taxes or regulation. I think companies like Tesla and Nikola take it for granted that people think carbon emissions are a disaster and that no expense should be spared in limiting these emissions. I'm not sure voters know exactly how expensive electric and hydrogen shipping is though!\n\nWhen the economy shifts and electricity is cheaper due to solar power and superconducting high voltage power transmission, I don't know what advantage Tesla and Nikola would have over companies like Toyota in taking advantage of new economic realities. Their patents will certainly have expired by then.\n\nEDIT: TLDR: With current tech, electricity would have to get at least 3x cheaper than it currently is for Tesla battery trucks to compete with diesel on shipping, and at least 6x cheaper for Nikola hydrogen fuel cell trucks to compete with diesel on shipping.\n\nEDIT 2: I'm way off on my comparison of the energy in hydrogen to diesel. 1 kg hydrogen has 33.3 kWh and 1 kg diesel has 12 kWh. Combined with the increased efficiency of electric motors versus internal combustion, hydrogen fuel cells are actually a lot closer to competing with diesel than I thought.", "id": "hutp2w", "created_utc": 1595278945.0, "score": 43, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "num_comments": 74, "comments": [{"body": "Bro, this looks like a shit college project that you repackaged for us autists.
