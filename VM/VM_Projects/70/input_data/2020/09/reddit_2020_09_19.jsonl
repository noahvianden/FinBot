{"title": "\"New study shows dangers of in-flight COVID-19 transmission\"", "selftext": "Here is the article: https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/517146-new-study-shows-dangers-of-in-flight-covid-transmission?amp\n\nSome excerpts:\n\n\"The risk for on-board transmission of SARS-CoV-2 during long flights is real and has the potential to cause COVID-19 clusters of substantial size, even in business class-like settings with spacious seating arrangements well beyond the established distance used to define close contact on airplanes,\" the study concluded.\n\n\"The researchers identified a 27-year-old woman in business class as the primary source of the outbreak. The woman first developed a sore throat and cough on Feb. 29. She boarded the plane March 1, and continued to experience those symptoms throughout the 10-hour flight.\"\n\n\"The woman was the only symptomatic person on the flight, but researchers found she had infected 12 people in business class, two passengers in economy and one flight attendant in economy.\"\n\nThis is where it gets good...\n\n\"The most likely route of transmission during the flight is aerosol or droplet transmission, the researchers found, particularly for people seated in business class. Contact with the infected woman might also have occurred outside the airplane at the airport, in particular among business class passengers in the pre-departure lounge area or during boarding. \n\nContact with the two economy class cases might have occurred after arrival during immigration or at baggage claim. \n\nThe researchers said the role of fomites and on-board surfaces like tray tables or toilets remains unknown. Airline crew often use business class toilets while on board, which might explain the case among the crew serving in economy class, because no other potential source of infection could be established.  \n\nThe flight took place March 1, before face masks were required or recommended on airplanes. Masks will certainly help reduce the risk of transmission, but the researchers said more on-board precautions and screening procedures should be taken, especially in the absence of a good test that can provide rapid results.\"\n\nAll I see there? Bullshit. Most likely, could have, likely, possibly, unknown. These idiots published something that has no provable conclusion other than this: THE BIGGEST DANGER OF CONTRACTING COVID IS FROM BEING UNMASKED AND NEAR OTHER CURRENTLY INFECTED PEOPLE.\n\nThis study uses an event at the height of the pandemic and is being published now to further stoke fear in people about travel. The reality is how many of you have seen or heard any information about people getting sick after flying? Given the circumstances they describe in the article that woman would have infected people in they were in an airplane, restaurant, dance hall, school, or theatre. \n\nSo when the airline stocks take a dip because people read this garbage and believe it, lock into those positions for cheap.\n\nDAL: 10/30 35C \n\nUAL: 10/30 45C\n\nAAL: 10/30 14C", "id": "iw149k", "created_utc": 1600550752.0, "score": 27, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "num_comments": 78, "comments": [{"body": "On modern planes the air is recycled every 3 minutes apparently.\n\nThe thing stopping me from traveling is that there's not really anywhere to go that would be fun.
