Yeah, nobody thinks this is going to save an ENTIRE BOOK, but maybe I need to meet my vega limits overnight and this is one weird/cheap way to do it without taking on virtually ANY delta/gamma exposure.

Fun to see someone else with knowledge of the business in here, there‚Äôs a few of us lurking around. \n\nNo I know what you mean lol, it‚Äôs my job to. But these puts will have almost no Vega to them. A Vega vs delta graph looks like a bell curve and they would be buying way way way way out on the wings.  The $1 put has .002 Vega. The $40 put has .11 Vega (also have very little delta/gamma), which is 55x as much and the price to Vega ratio is similar. As a market maker I‚Äôd MUCH rather own the $40 put because it‚Äôs a lot more likely I can get rid of it for a fairish price later. Many market makers only quote down to a certain delta (or they keep the tiniest options the same width as larger delta options) because the model can get a little wonky on tiny options and let‚Äôs face it you‚Äôre gonna have to take these off with another market maker not a customer.\n\nSo I agree this was likely dealer hedging, but I don‚Äôt agree this was the optimal way to do it.
