Shouldn't we wait till expiration to buy back our OTM call if we need to? Because  buying it back on day of expiration will be way cheaper. But I guess there's a risk here because someone might exercise the call if the OTM you sold ever gets ITM (in which case you will lose your LEAP). So in this case do you just buy back as soon as the call you sold is getting close to ITM?\n2. So the motivation behind selling on green days is because you might get fucked if you sold on a red day, because the next day is more likely to be a green day that makes your OTM call potentially ITM (which is bad for you). Whereas if you sold on a green day, it's less likely that tomorrow will also be another green day?\n3. Also a more finer detail question on execution - so do you sell your OTM towards market close? That's the only way you know that it's a green day after all.

I thought the only thing you bought was an ITM leap? So you buy both?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "So the way I believe it works is you buy an ITM (preferably deep ITM) LEAP. Think 80 delta, 2 years out (the price difference between a 1 year out and 2 year out LEAP is pretty small, so go with the 2 year out because now you've bought yourself a ton of time to execute your strategy).\n\nNow every week, you sell an OTM (think 20 delta) call. So it's unlikely this call will become ITM.  Two things can now happen\n\n1. Most likely this call stays OTM and you keep whatever premium you got for selling it\n2. Once in a blue moon the stock is going to move significantly, and the OTM call you sold will become ITM or very close to ITM. Now if it becomes ITM, the buyer of the call you sold can now exercise their ITM call, which means you're going to have to provide 100 shares to them, which means you're going to have to use up your LEAP (i.e. your LEAP is now gone!). To protect your LEAP, whenever the stock gets very close to the OTM strike, you want to buy back the OTM strike call to essentially close your order (you sold to open, now you buy to close)\n\nThe idea is, because you have 100+ weeks to execute this strategy, each week collecting say up to 100 bucks on premium, you'll eventually cover the entire cost of the LEAP and then some (although every now and then you'll have a bad week and you'll have to buy back the OTM call to protect your LEAP, and you'll take a loss for that week).

TSLA is down almost 20% just since the beginning of September, a big player in a massive overheating months-long run up fueled by speculators (cough none of those here cough) and institutions with little choice but adding more combustibles to the fire because they don’t have much of a choice otherwise thanks to zero rates from the Fed. Add in mass unemployment, zero stimulus, zero vaccine, and abysmal pandemic management from the feds and many states (let’s send all the kids to school together without masks!)... it doesn’t look too good for your outlook to become reality. \n\nSorry to break it to you, but stonks only go up until they don’t.

The market really barely gives a shit, if it did the market would be full on bearish. We know the recession is fragmented and is not pinching the demographics that buy Tesla vehicles in 2020. Plenty of companies destroying earnings forecasts, others waiting in the wings for their eventual time to shine. Tesla is still on track to hit pre-COVID sales forecasts, and actively expanding charging infrastructure to accommodate the growth.\n\nNevertheless, all I said is that it panic-oversold in AH and there is a small gap that should fill tomorrow and I did that without rocket ships and way OTM calls.

It looks like TSLA is going to open sub-400 and beneath its 5 and 20 day moving averages. It dropped beneath the 20 day several times today and closed right at it; it’s already below the 5 day. The other big growth names (AAPL, FB, etc) have dropped to it below their 50 day moving averages, and in some cases their 100 day moving averages. TSLA’s 50 day is 360.92, 100 day is 276.62.
