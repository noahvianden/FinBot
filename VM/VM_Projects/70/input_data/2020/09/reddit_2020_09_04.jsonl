I think it was like $10B worth. Huge positions. \n\nThen, over the last few months, they bought $4B worth of calls on those same stocks. Now, calls are a ~~gambling instrument~~ purchase contract that you are betting another person that a certain stock will be *higher* than it is currently at a certain date. This is where the market makers step in. The MM exist to ensure liquidity, they're who you buy stocks from, for instance. So softbank traders were sending in call blocks of 10/50, making the buys look like retail. But they'll do like hundreds an hour. The MM take these call options electronically, bundle them up, and sell them, making money on the turn (they set prices). \n\nBut: calls require underlying stocks to guarantee them. So the banks want to take these bets because FUCKING LOL $$$ so they went out  and buy those stocks to cover the calls. And it's not like asking your boss to buy a bajillion shares of apple or google or amazon is a tough sell, particularly when the vol is massive and those all seem to move one way. \n\nNow this doesn't matter when you're ~~degenerate gambling~~ risk balancing on robinhood (IB in Canada). When it's $4B on the same stocks? That's fucking bajillions of stocks in aggregate. Remember, all of these options that softbank is betting require someone else to front the stock, but buying all those shares causes the share prices to go up. It's a fucking positive feedback loop where the end is a giant pot of winnings. Softbank buying all those calls made banks buy those shares, and this caused a run on the prices of all of those shares, and everyone else rose as well. Then the calls come due, softbank gets paid, and then people figure it out. We are there. Probably. Maybe.\n\nSo basically what softbank did was spread out a bunch of bets that required financial institutions to go out and purchase hundreds of thousands of blocks of those equities to ensure the bets. But a rising tide actually does float all boats on the market. So the rest of the market went dumb. If you see a stock go up 5%, you look at its competition and say \"maybe there's a deal there\" and whatever the delta was before evens out back to equilibrium. What I'm saying is that market are neither efficient nor rational. \n\nNow, *you* can't do this sort of shit because you don't have a $4B float and unlimited risk tolerance. But if nobody is watching someone with giant pockets certainly can. Now, it certainly seems to have worked out for them. But unless all of those positions are exited someone is going to find a way to completely fuck them. Like if Goldman would have seen this they would have figured out a way to bankrupt Softbank and made money off it. But they missed it because shit's fucking wild if you haven't noticed.\n\nThis is gonna absolutely smash a stock like zoom.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Basically a much longer version of what I said except I disagree with your description of calls being \"gambling instruments\".

If you were paying attention, you shouldve sold all your shit on this day.\n\nWhy, you may ask? Because of today's timeline\n\n8:00 AM EST - the zoomer coin crashes, whales are pulling out\n\n9:30 AM EST - the FUD from tsla crashing caused all the fomo holders of ARK etfs to sell\n\n9:45 AM EST - bc everyone started selling ARK etfs trying to escape their tsla positions due to already seeing red the previous day, other ARK holdings like square and amazon started crashing as well (which are qqq holdings too).\n\n10:00 AM EST - because everyone started selling qqq holdings, the QQQ holders started selling because they already felt pain from aapl. The central time zone also woke up and started selling QQQ\n\n11:00 AM EST - because QQQ started crashing, SPY holders started getting nervous and selling off. PLUS, california woke up and started selling\n\nNOON EST - it was at this time that the FUD news articles started getting written and the smooth brains started selling off\n\nthe rest of the day proceeded as you would expect\n\non a side note, fuck you cunts who sent tsla and aapl parabolic, youre the reason my ark position is bleeding out of its ass today\n\nanyway, here's whats going to happen. As more and more of the world wakes up to the fact that tech is gonna go down much further, we'll have one more crash day, and most likely two small red days following that\n\nWhat should you do, you might ask?\n\nFirst, lets identify where support is currently. One can do this by looking at stocks like nvda, amzn, googl, fb, crm, tsla, aapl, and identifying where the tech support levels are. Generally this is the point where they were before aapl and tsla fomoers sent them parabolic. Once tech reaches those support levels, the selloff on the broad market will stop, just like the selloff began from the tech market\n\ndo you need to know this support? Not really, because\n\nVXX 35 november calls will still print. You want november expiration so that you wont get iv crushed, since youll get padded with the election FUD.\n\nEven though youre late, you can still make 10-20% gains as the second day of crashing occurs. However, you want to identify the support levels you will close your positions at\n\nand thats it folks, buy volatility, since it will go up.\n\nAlternatively, you could do puts on qqq, but im pretty smooth brained so ive rarely made money on puts, so i just stay away from them\n\nedit 9:00 AM : GOOGLE SEARCH NON FARM PAYROLL, THIS SCALP IS NO LONGER CERTAIN.\n\nedit 9:33 AM: thank christ, it looks like I was wrong, the bull run continues, still fuck all the tsla and aapl fomo'ers\n\nedit 9:43 AM: fuck, aight, this strategy might be back\n\nedit 9:50 AM: my vxx calls are up 6% right now, seems like the strategy is still working with people fearing another crash day even if it doesn't happen in full\n\nedit 10 AM: my vxx calls are up 5% right now, qqq puts are up 10%\n\nedit 10:05 AM: I sold off half my positions, im not an expert, but it seems like aapl is hitting support at 115, knowing myself, i probably lost on half my gains\n\nedit 10:37 AM: vxx calls up 30%, qqq puts up 40%", "id": "im6i44", "created_utc": 1599182301.0, "score": 121, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 68, "comments": [{"body": "Can you just hold me and tell me it's gonna be ok?
