My dad is a financial advisor and near the end of his career so I've had the good fortune of his guidance since I was like 15.

So I've seen a few stock splits. Technically a split doesnt mean anything it's like breaking a 20 bill, you still have $20 but to new investors who are just ignorant because they just havent learned yet or there accounts are small it's an opportunity to buy something they either legitimately couldnt afford or if youre like me have an aversion to paying $$$$$ for a single share.... Tesla sort of broke me of that. If the stock is a good value relative to its ability to earn money, or just hyped and gonna run- price per share doesnt meant much\n\nI made a little money with silver options, may get back into those a little.

When the market wnet down Thursday/Friday- I bought a little SPXU Thursday morning, when the downdraft accelerated I bought a little more Thursday afternoon. After the run tech had, A one day drop and recovery the next day was unlikely, especially with the long weekend coming.  I backed the truck up and bought a ton more.

I was pondering holding till later in the afternoon but got out when the entire position was up 8% in a day... \n\nThat Friday morning buy made about 2.4% I sold it within 17 minutes (helps when you have 2 screens at work and you can do work on one and have an eye on the market on the other.) I'm not trading looking for big moves and I'm not betting against the market - I bet the direction its already headed. Make 0.3% in an hour, sweet that's $200 and almost 2 days pay. Sell. Move $200 to savings, then dont increase the bet tomorrow. \n\nThe object isnt to win big, its to win small win often. I'm not looking to get rich,off trading. My savings is making nothing. I'm not sure what I want to buy and hold long term- so this is just a way to make a little coin while the market doesnt make sense.

Others prefer not to really think about it much at all and buy either professionally managed or index tracking funds or ETFs. And still others have a combination of both of those things with different parts of their portfolios.\n\nGet a good book like one of the “for Dummies” series (excellent for beginners) and read through it and think about your personality and what investments will let you sleep easy at night!\n\nYou are very young and have your entire life ahead of you so you will be able to select much lower risk/lower return investments over your lifetime and still have a very nice portfolio at retirement age.\n\nThe main thing is to invest systematically and automatically.  It is easiest to just have investment money come right out of your paycheck when you have a job. If you can’t do that, automatically transfer it to your investment account from checking every month.\n\nBut save enough cash so you can always afford about six months of living expenses in the event you are ever unemployed down the road. An emergency fund kept in a savings account is a very important thing for an investor to have so you never need to sell investments to pay for unexpected expenses.\n\nThis part should be pretty obvious, but AVOID the temptation to get in debt...especially with credit cards! Credit card debt is the fastest way I know of to completely derail your investing plans. NEVER spend more on a credit card than you know you can pay off completely when you get you bill!\n\nWith other installment loans, try to borrow as little as possible and make sure you are getting good value for your money. Keep interest rates as low as possible and try to pay it off as quickly as possible. Paying interest is never good for you...try to pay with cash (credit cards okay as long as you keep them paid off) and you will already be WAY ahead of many of your peers in their financial lives.\n\nLast tip - make your own investment decisions or find a good investment advisor who knows and understands your goals to choose appropriate investments for you. DO NOT EVER go to social media or other random forums and ask strangers for investment tips. Some people are helpful, some people are crazy....but NONE of them are YOU and they don’t know your personality or goals!\n\nBe wise and choose appropriate investments and you will enjoy a prosperous lifetime in the market. Best of luck to you!", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "Wauw I’m very grateful for all this advice, will definetelly read those books. What do you think about Vanguard Index funds?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I personally like VYM, the high dividend one, it includes so many of the companies you'd want to invest in individually - Verizon, Proctor & Gamble, Merck, Abbvie, Walmart, Coke, Honeywell, Intel, Exelon, Hershey, Conagra, Aflac, Clorox, 3M, CVS, etc. etc. etc.  It's my favorite ETF.  It pays at the end of Sept, Dec, March, and June.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "In my PERSONAL (I again will stress - I am not YOU) opinion, I like Vanguard index funds. They have among the lowest expense ratios in the industry and their funds tend to perform  perhaps slightly better than similar funds from other find families.\n\nHowever, even with funds, do your research. Most fund families will offer both ETFs (exchange traded funds) as well as mutual funds. They will very frequently offer similar tracking funds (say, the S&P 500 index for example) in both fund types. While the investments within the funds may be nearly identical, the rules that dictate how you can buy or sell the funds may vary.\n\nAs a quick example, ETFs are traded on the major exchanges just like stocks. They are priced throughout the trading day and may be bought or sold whenever the market is open...however ONLY in FULL SHARE increments.\n\nMutual funds are not traded on the exchange. They have their price, known as the NAV (net asset value) calculated based on the price of the stocks that the fund is invested in at the market close each day. You can generally only buy or sell shares of a mutual fund once per day based on the NAV for that day. While this is a disadvantage, it may be offset by the fact that you can buy specific dollar amounts, or fractional shares, of a mutual fund...something you can not do with an ETF. These are particularly useful inside of an employer sponsored retirement account where you, as a future employee, may want to contribute the same amount of cash each payday from your paycheck.\n\nBut each type of fund will have different expenses, loads (sales or redemption fees), etc...so do your research and know what you are buying before committing your money. I am not sure about securities regulations in your country, however in the U.S. investors are always provided a copy of the fund prospectus after they have purchased a new fund in their account. However that is generally a bit late - you should try to download and read the fund prospectus BEFORE you invest. It will specifically define ALL of the rules that are applicable to that particular fund. This isn’t a requirement...and many people, myself included, have bought funds without reading the prospectus first.
