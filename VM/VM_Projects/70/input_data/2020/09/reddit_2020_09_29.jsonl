If it loses money in the next week or two and you wanna exit for a loss, you can. If the stock rockets and you make 50% profit in the next week, you can take the money and run. If earning disappoint, you've at least got a week to exit somewhat gracefully. A moderate loss instead of a total loss.\n\nI have 10, so that's $5k which with some luck will become $10k. I know that's not 'how would i turn $8 into $40million?' but trussssss me daddy, doubling up will make you rich.
