{"title": "Why isn't obvious scam $NKLA dropping to 0 so my absurdly expensive puts can print?", "selftext": "Hi there, NKLA bagholders. You're probably enjoying a nice Fanta in your garage, basement, or shed while your wife's massage therapist helps her relax before her boyfriend comes home. Good choice of beverage. I know you've been happily stacking tendies all summer from your smooth-brain, stonks-only-go-up TSLA/AAPL calls. I know you expected it to be easy over here on the 🌈🐻 side of things, especially after Hindenburg Meme Labs released such high-Scoville meme fodder on such an obviously overvalued target.\n\nBut sadly, over here you actually have to know what the fuck you're doing if you want to avoid getting regauged to a new bore diameter by J-Pow's low orbit money cannon. You have to know when a stonk is going to tank, and to know when, you have to know why.\n\nAnd no, \"being an obvious scam\" is not a valid reason why. What did you think moved prices? Fundamental value? Free cash flow? No. If you want to play in a market that makes sense, go back to managing your wife's yoga instructor's fantasy football team.\n\nPeople move markets. Not people like you, no matter what Bloomberg says, it's people with allocation authority over huge pools of capital. People like the ones who participated in NKLA's $525 million early access special boys only PIPE the day before their IPO on 6/3. They bought at $10. They hold at least 14% of NKLA's traded shares, and they can't sell until 12/21. And a totally legal little caveat they agreed to says the price has to remain above $12 for the last 20 days of their lockup for those shares to become tradeable.\n\nThat's right. NKLA bribed a bunch of big money funds with extra-cheap shares to make sure they've got skin in the game, and they'll keep propping up NKLA until their lockup expires. When you're a fraudulent company with no reason to be taken seriously, it's a nice way of buying alignment. If you've ever murdered somebody to cement your membership in a gang, it's like that: now you have to be on the same side no matter what, because the alternative is life in prison. Go fuck yourself, John Nash.\n\nWhat does this mean for you, the Fanta-sipping retail bagholder? It means the stupidly overpriced short-term puts you bought after the Hindenburg news dropped never had a chance of printing. The shops writing those puts always knew they'd expire worthless, because they're professionals who already knew this shit, not degenerate gambling addicts warming themselves over a burning pile of losing lottery tickets.\n\nBut don't lose hope, because the flip side of this bleak reality is that there's always somebody dumber than you. Probably. You just need to bite the bullet and get out of your dumb reactionary short play ASAP, even though it's down 60% from its manic high, sell it to some poor autist who didn't read this post and chill for a month or two.\n\nYes, a month or two. Unless the SEC actually extracts the glue from its nose and enforces the law (it won't), NKLA isn't moving until PIPE investors say it does. So there's no reason to build a position now only to eat 50% theta decay while the big boys prop the price up against the minor selling pressure of dumb IPO buyers who started seeing your HTML5 memes popping up on CNBC. Instead, wait for premiums to come down as the target expiry gets closer. Don't cut it too close - funds that didn't get in on the PIPE will be anticipating this selloff, and the price will start dropping in advance of the PIPE lockup expiry date no matter what kind of defense the big shareholders can put up. If you start buying puts on 12/14 it's too late. So start building on 10/14 or 11/1.\n\nBy the way, the only other big NKLA move coming down the pipe besides Trevor's big move outside the reach of extradition is the end of the lockup period for one of the original investors, Worthington Industries, which can sell a stake equivalent to 2% of NKLA's traded shares 90 days after IPO, or 10/1. But compared to the money waiting for 12/21, not to mention the squeeze you autists are putting on NKLA shares by wildly overbidding for short positions, this selling pressure probably won't amount to much. The real play is in December.\n\nPosition: Nothing until 11/1.
