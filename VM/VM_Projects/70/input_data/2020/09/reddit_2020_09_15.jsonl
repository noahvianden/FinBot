{"title": "Packaging Deep Dive- the new battleground between Intel, AMD and TSMC", "selftext": " This is part 2 of a series on semiconductor companies. If you read part 1,available both on my [blog](https://www.infinitevalueptr.com/post/intel_10nm?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=r%2Finvesting) and [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/i73sw1/deep_dive_into_the_reasons_behind_why_intel_is/),  you’d be forgiven for thinking that the future is all doom and gloom  for Intel. However, the reality is that’s not necessarily the case.  Their longer-term future bears some promise. Although it’s incredibly  important, lithography is not the be-all and end-all of integrated  circuit design manufacturing. Another critical part which has often been  overlooked in the past is packaging – essentially how you make the  calculations done on the transistors be transported to the outside  world. The process of making a semiconductor device consists of  fabricating on wafers with lithography, slicing the wafer into dies,  which are then packaged. Packaging protects the die from damage, and  lets the chip communicate with the outside world – as well as within the  package itself. One of the few things Intel management have said over  the past few years that I whole-heartedly agree with is that packaging,  not lithographic process, is the future. The main reason for this is the  falling benefits of moving to smaller processes \\[1\\], coupled with  rapidly increasing costs – a EUV machine to make advanced processes can  cost up to $125million \\[2\\], while the R&D costs to make smaller  processes are also increasing \\[3\\].\n\nWhat is packaging?\n\nThe  best analogy for understanding packaging design is that of  architectural history. Imagine each transistor is a human worker.  Traditional lithographic improvements have been focused around making  the ‘workers’ more productive in smaller spaces – first  hunter-gathering, then farming, then offices, etc. However, we’re now at  the point where workers have so little room to move in their workspaces  (cubicles) it’s extremely difficult to do any more cost-savings the  traditional way. Instead, what we need to do is break out of the  traditional paradigm we have of placing everyone in one massive building  and move to more radical designs. There are two main ways we could go  about doing this: chiplets and 3D stacking\\[4\\]. In the terminology of our  analogy, chiplets are like if you split up the old massive office  building into a campus with multiple smaller offices, where each team  can work on a job that they’re specialised in, or where you can cut  costs by having inexperienced interns working in one particular  department that’s not too important instead of being forced to use  identical workers of the same quality across all departments under a  ‘monolithic’ , single-office design. The challenge we have is to ensure  that communication flows easily and quickly between each different  office building.\n\n3D stacking is  like going from a society where we only have bungalows (single-layer  chips, the traditionally dominant choice in high-performance computing)  to high-rise buildings (3D stacked chips, where you have multiple dies  on top of each other). The challenge we have is constructing  life-support systems like elevators, that can enable data to transfer  rapidly out of the CPU, or sewage pipes, that help let waste (heat)  escape.\n\nChiplets\n\nChiplets  are sometimes called 2.5D stacking, referring to the fact that they’re  commonly viewed as a stepping stone between 2D and 3D packaging. The  most common method, the one that’s widely used right now (notably in  AMD’s Zen 2 architecture), has an ‘interposer’ sitting underneath the  chips you want to connect.\\[5\\] This interposer acts as a conduit between  the two (or more) chips, enabling rapid communication. Think of it as  having a concrete floor between the office buildings, where before you  had knee-height grass making communication between offices inefficient  (PCB traces).  AMD famously uses Infinity Fabric, which we’ll discuss  later, but on a hardware level it’s likely that they’re using TSMC’s  CoWoS – Chip on Wafer on Substrate technology. In this implementation,  the Chip is put on a Wafer that helps communication between the chips  (the concrete floor), which is put on a substrate (the ground). \\[6\\]The  second approach, which Intel is pursuing with EMIB (and TSMC are  exploring in very early stages), is basically forgoing the concrete  floor and choosing to use tunnels between the office buildings instead.  \\[7\\]While this approach is faster – each tunnel is dedicated to only  connecting two dies, so you won’t have issues where data is trying to  get to lots of different places at once and getting ‘stuck’, as you  would with AMD’s approach, it’s harder to design products for – you have  to design and place a tunnel, rather than simply placing a concrete  foundation and plonking whatever you want on the foundation. Really,  this is a simple continuation of the two companies’ philosophies. AMD’s  HyperTransport, the predecessor of Infinity Fabric, is an open source  interconnect that can easily be implemented across processors.  Meanwhile, Intel’s EMIB predecessor, FSB, was proprietary and needs to  be specially modified for each processor design. While Intel has made  it’s successor to FSB, AIB (advanced interface bus) open-source in an  attempt to alleviate flaws, much like its 10nm process, the differences  inherent in initial design choices are difficult to overcome. Which  approach is going to be superior remains to be seen. In my opinion, it’s  evident that each company has chosen the approach that’s best for it –  Intel with its larger budget/manpower can afford have teams of engineers  working on specialised implementations of packaging for each product,  to get slightly better performance; while AMD’s smaller size drives them  to seek a scalable, easily replicable design that can be used across  many designs with minimal adaptation. Infinity Fabric, which is AMD’s  own protocol implementing extremely high speed connections between  different dies (essentially, the secret sauce in how the ‘concrete  foundation’ is made), can in theory be used by any company to connect  their custom chiplets to Zen chiplets with minimal input from AMD, which  is impossible with Intel. \\[8\\] At the same time, it could also be used  by AMD in GPUs to make chiplet-based designs, which could have a massive  impact on scalability of performance, manufacturing costs etc. – just  like what happened in the CPU area. One only needs to look at the  massive Nvidia A100 chip, with its correspondingly massive manufacturing  costs, to see how much of an impact this could have on the market.\n\nChiplets  are here right now from AMD/TSMC, they’re sort of here from Intel,  expected to come online at a much larger scale from Intel in the next  few years, and will be here to stay. The two ‘teams’ have differing  philosophies in how their chiplets are constructed, and it’ll be  fascinating to see which is more successful. In my opinion, if Intel can  improve the morale of its engineers and kick things into high gear,  EMIB will be more successful in high-performance computing workloads,  while the simpler approach from AMD/TSMC have secured them dominance for  the next two years at the very least.\n\n3D stacking\n\nIn  theory, going 3D is just another form of chiplets (you put each chip on  top of each other, instead of next to each other), but the challenges  are sufficiently different that it’s easier to discuss them separately.\n\n3D  stacking is probably a lot closer than what most people think. Despite  the fact that Intel announced its’ ‘Foveros’ stacking tech in 2019 \\[9\\],  Samsung announced their ‘X-cube’ packaging a few weeks ago \\[10\\], and  TSMC announcing their ‘3DFabric’ family just a few days ago \\[11\\], the  reality is that 3D stacking has been around for years. As explained  earlier, the problem with 3D stacking is that you need to dissipate the  heat, as well as transfer data. High-performance chips like those made  by Intel, AMD and Nvidia produce large amounts of heat and require large  amounts of data throughput, making it difficult for them to use 3D  stacking. However, other types of chips with lower heat and data, like  mobile phones, have been using PoP (Package on Package) stacking  forever, which basically folds a 2-chip processor in half like a book,  to reduce to horizontal footprint while increasing the vertical  footprint.\\[12\\] Even ‘true’ 3D stacking – where you build layers one on  top of another, is viable in certain use cases. DRAM manufacturers have  been using 3D stacking since 2011, and NAND manufacturing wasn’t far  behind.\\[13\\] SK Hynix recently released a 128-layer NAND SSD! For the  high-performance chips we are most concerned with, we have mostly solved  the issues with transferring data, and simply need to solve the cooling  issues and manufacturing challenges. The way that data is transferred  through different layers is using TSV (through-silicon vias). \\[14\\] These  are essentially elevators going through the layers that transfer data.  Compared to PoP solutions, the chip is higher density, and the  connection is shorter -elevators are direct and faster. While we can  technically stack any chips we want together right now – TSMC’s SoIC is  slated for mass production in 2021 (likely for mobile chips), \\[11\\] the  issue is that cutting edge chips – especially x86 chips used in  datacentres which go for thousands of dollars, throw off a lot of heat.  AMD Epyc’s 7742 has a TDP (thermal design power – an approximation of  how much heat a processor outputs under load) of 225W, \\[15\\]while Intel’s  Xeon 9282 has a TDP of 400W. \\[16\\] When you consider the fact that all  this heat is coming off a piece of silicon <500mm2, it’s apparent  that it’s extremely difficult to disperse all that energy. Current  techniques, where we essentially have a lump of metal on top of the chip  conducting heat up to a fan that shifts huge volumes of cool air past  the chip, cooling it down, are about as optimised as they can be. Before  we can stack CPU logic chips on each other, we most likely need a  paradigm shift in design philosophies – either drastic improvements in  efficiency, or more likely some way to conduct heat out of the chip  better than we have now. The most advanced suggestion so far seems to be  tiny channels between layers that circulate coolant inside the chip,  making it so each layer is cooled well rather than just the top layer as  is the case with current designs. \\[17\\] Obviously, this is completely  uneconomical to mass produce currently. However, it is possible with  current technology to place a less hot component on top of a logic die  and reap the speed benefits between those two chips – for instance  Samsung’s newly announced X-cube technology, which places SRAM on top of  a logic die. \\[10\\] We’re likely to see a few years of this sort of  in-between state, where RAM; IO; FPGA etc. are stacked on top of logic  dies, before we reach the ‘Holy Grail’ of high-power logic on logic –  and perhaps even every component in a system, from CPU, GPU, RAM, to  various accelerators being all packaged into one single chip  horizontally, laterally and vertically. True 3D stacking is so far away  that it’s impossible to see the winner, however when judging the  intermediary efforts that various vendors have announced, I am of the  opinion that Intel has the greatest potential with Foveros for the  reasons below; while Samsung is extremely competitive – even leading, in  the areas where it is offering solutions, and TSMC is the overall  leader with the widest array of offerings which are all highly  effective, both in cost and performance.\n\nAfter  reading all that, you probably feel cheated. Wasn’t I going to tell you  why Intel’s future is promising? It feels like I just explained the  opposite doesn’t it? Well, the reasoning for why I said Intel’s future  is promising is threefold.\n\n1. Packaging  is in its’ infancy compared to process. Intel might appear to be behind  now, but the distance is definitely not as much as they are behind in  process, and given where we are in packaging maturity (we’re at the very  start of the diminishing returns graph, where it’s easy to make big  strides), Intel could easily climb ahead given their engineering  prowess. In addition, opposite of what has become evident in  lithography, where outsourcing to a specialised foundry has ‘won’ the  battle against vertical integration, it could very well be that  integration will be more successful in packaging, with a holistic,  unified approach to designing a chip proving useful.\n2. Intel  spends far more money on research than anyone else - $13 billion in  2019, while TSMC spent $3 billion. (or 18.6% of revenue vs 8.5%).  \\[18\\]\\[19\\] Although Intel’s operations are broader, with investments in  anything from process/packaging to self-driving and memory, it’s likely  that Intel’s spending on packaging and process exceeds that of  competitors. In addition, Intel’s engineers are colloquially known to be  some of the best in the business. It’s current woes are largely a  function of management problems, not monetary or talent-based.\n3. Intel’s  (mis)management deserves a post, if not a book of its own. Suffice it  to say the corporate equivalent of Game of Thrones has been going down  for the past decade, and now Littlefinger has finally managed to slay  his enemies and gain complete control. Littlefinger may not be the best  person to lead an semiconductor company, and his position may be  constantly under threat from the Iron Bank (the board), but at least the  internal politics and strife should be largely out of the way, opening  up the chance for a focused Intel putting their full momentum behind a  comeback – a terrifying thought for any competitors.\n\nIf these possibilities do come to pass, the future of AMD, and to a lesser extent TSMC/Nvidia looks bleak.\n\nSemiconductors  are an incredibly complex industry. The very things that create such  huge barriers to entry for competitors, and impressive returns for  shareholders, make it difficult for us to truly understand the  technological aspect of the companies are we invested in. My investing  style relies heavily on an understanding of the things I’m investing in,  and I hope that this series looking at some of the more technical  aspects of semiconductors can help all of you gain an understanding as  well, and to cut through the marketing spiel that management regularly  throws at us.\n\nFeel free to contact me if there’s anything you’d like me to look at, and thanks for taking the time to read!\n\n\\[1\\] [https://cartesianproduct.wordpress.com/2013/04/15/the-end-of-dennard-scaling/](https://cartesianproduct.wordpress.com/2013/04/15/the-end-of-dennard-scaling/)\n\n\\[2\\] [https://www.eetimes.com/euv-tool-costs-hit-120-million/](https://www.eetimes.com/euv-tool-costs-hit-120-million/)\n\n\\[3\\] [http://euvlsymposium.lbl.gov/pdf/2012/pres/G.%20Yeric.pdf](http://euvlsymposium.lbl.gov/pdf/2012/pres/G.%20Yeric.pdf)\n\n\\[4\\] [https://semiengineering.com/knowledge\\_centers/packaging/advanced-packaging/](https://semiengineering.com/knowledge_centers/packaging/advanced-packaging/)\n\n\\[5\\] [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/340843129\\_Chiplet\\_Heterogeneous\\_Integration\\_Technology-Status\\_and\\_Challenges](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/340843129_Chiplet_Heterogeneous_Integration_Technology-Status_and_Challenges)\n\n\\[6\\] [https://www.tsmc.com/english/dedicatedFoundry/services/cowos.htm](https://www.tsmc.com/english/dedicatedFoundry/services/cowos.htm)\n\n\\[7\\] [https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/foundry/emib.html](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/foundry/emib.html)\n\n\\[8\\] [https://www.amd.com/en/campaigns/hpc-solutions-webinar](https://www.amd.com/en/campaigns/hpc-solutions-webinar)\n\n\\[9\\] [https://www.eejournal.com/article/intel-foveros-3d-packaging/](https://www.eejournal.com/article/intel-foveros-3d-packaging/)\n\n\\[10\\] [https://news.samsung.com/global/tag/samsung-x-cube](https://news.samsung.com/global/tag/samsung-x-cube)\n\n\\[11\\]TSMC Technology Symposium 2020\n\n\\[12\\] [https://sst.semiconductor-digest.com/chipworks\\_real\\_chips\\_blog/2019/01/16/the-packaging-of-apples-a12x-is-weird/](https://sst.semiconductor-digest.com/chipworks_real_chips_blog/2019/01/16/the-packaging-of-apples-a12x-is-weird/)\n\n\\[13\\] [https://www.nvmdurance.com/history-of-3d-nand-flash-memory/](https://www.nvmdurance.com/history-of-3d-nand-flash-memory/)\n\n\\[14\\] [http://www.appliedmaterials.com/files/Applied\\_TSV\\_Primer.pdf](http://www.appliedmaterials.com/files/Applied_TSV_Primer.pdf)\n\n\\[15\\] [https://www.amd.com/en/products/cpu/amd-epyc-7742](https://www.amd.com/en/products/cpu/amd-epyc-7742)\n\n\\[16\\] [https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/194146/intel-xeon-platinum-9282-processor-77m-cache-2-60-ghz.html](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/194146/intel-xeon-platinum-9282-processor-77m-cache-2-60-ghz.html)\n\n\\[17\\] [https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02503-1](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02503-1)\n\n\\[18\\] [https://www.intc.com/filings-reports/all-sec-filings/content/0000050863-20-000011/0000050863-20-000011.pdf](https://www.intc.com/filings-reports/all-sec-filings/content/0000050863-20-000011/0000050863-20-000011.pdf)\n\n\\[19\\] [https://www.tsmc.com/download/ir/annualReports/2019/english/index.html](https://www.tsmc.com/download/ir/annualReports/2019/english/index.html)\n\n\\[20\\] [https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-leadership-tech-team-changes-not-delayed-murthy-renduchintala-leaves](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-leadership-tech-team-changes-not-delayed-murthy-renduchintala-leaves)", "id": "it7nbn", "created_utc": 1600172442.0, "score": 516, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 70, "comments": [{"body": "That’s a great read.

Is there a good website to find that data?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I used https://www.optionseducation.org/toolsoptionquotes/optionscalculator for the calculator and https://www.ivolatility.com/options/FDX/NYSE/ ([3mo IV Index Call graph](https://www.ivolatility.com/options.j?ticker=FDX:NYSE&R=1&period=3&chart=2&vct=1)) to get an idea of historical IV for your option FDX201002C00260000 (FDX 260 C 10/2)\n\nMy inputs were:\n\n* Symbol: FDX\n* Style: American\n* Price (stock, closing): 236.67\n* Strike: 260\n* Expiration Date: FLEX\n* Days to Expiration: 17\n* Volatility %: 63.5% (for a FDX201002C00260000)\n* Rest doesn't matter / doesn't influence the price\n\nHit calculate and you'll get an option call value of about $4.9665. While it is not exactly the bid/ask price of the option value as of close, it is within the spread at close. I currently see a BID of 4.75 and an ASK of 5.75. \n\nLooking at the other site to give a rough idea of historical IV, I can see its in the mid 30s looking at the 3mo IV Index Call graph during the month of July, prior to its run-up before today's earnings. A safe bet would be that IV drops to it's value before the earnings run-up (but not lower). Again, that is the lowest I think IV will drop, but we shall see, and that is how I got 33.5% or a 30% IV crush post earnings.\n\nBack to the calculator.. our calculated call price today at close was $4.9665. Now lets plug in some values for tomorrow...\n\n* Symbol: FDX\n* Style: American\n* Price (stock, at time of this comment): 255.30\n* Strike: 260\n* Expiration Date: FLEX\n* Days to Expiration: 16 (17 - 1 day..)\n* Volatility %: 33.5 (63.5% - 30% IV crush expected at worst?)\n* Rest doesn't matter / doesn't influence the price\n\nHit calculate and you get $5.1002 for the Call Option Value. So theoretically if you bought a FDX 260 C 10/2 at close for $4.9665 today and FDX opened tomorrow at $255.30 and the FDX 260 C 10/2 opened with an IV of 33.5% and you sold right away, you would net $0.1337 (odd).\n\nIt's much easier to calculate the breakeven price at expiration because it's just the strike price + the premium paid for the option (for a long call).

If you're looking to play earnings, I think you need to think longer term and look at things way earlier than the week or days before a company's earnings. You should be thinking about earnings weeks ahead of time, in my opinion.  \n\nWhat you describe is just playing with fire, like most of this sub, and sometimes you'll win, other times it will just blow up in your face and you'll walk away with pennies compared to what you entered your position with ($$ wise). Playing with options that expire in ~2 weeks is extremely risky, the likely hood of losing most or all of the premium you invested in them is extremely high if the stock does not move up quickly. A stock moving sideways will still demolish any weekly options position due to theta. \n\nI rarely play earnings. There is just too much that can go wrong, and you really need to do your research on companies that you're thinking about playing earnings on. If you're trying to play the long call options game, there is the race against the IV crush. Hoping the earnings surprise (as well as other factors) beats the piss out of what the markets expected, so that the gain in stock price outpaces the loss in value of the option due to IV crush. In the case of FedEx, imagine if the stock only moved 8 points after market hours, the IV crush at open tomorrow would have smoked all of those positions.\n\nI usually like buying leaps and selling cash covered calls on stocks I don't mind owning at particular strike prices (if you have enough buying power), selling puts on stock I already own, and just holding shares (boring I know, BTFD).
