Prescanning makes no sense, other than to pretend you are closer to level 5 than you actually are.\n\n> Lidar is becoming cheaper and smaller. gone from $10,000 to close to $100 in the near future. your argument is really that it is ugly? weak point.\n\nMy point is not that it's ugly, my point as that if it's as ugly as it is consumers will not buy it, regardless of whether I care about how it looks.\n\n> Tesla is nowhere near level 5 and its path forward does not look great waymo is on the path.\n\nIt all depends on how you look at it. A lot of the shortsellers spreading misinformation will have you believe that Tesla's competitors are further in autonomy because they are at level 3 and Tesla isn't. Truthfully, the reason Tesla isn't at level 3 (or 4 for that matter) is because they don't care about checking the boxes for any autonomy level other than level 5. The only thing they're focused on is reaching Level 5, and they're a lot closer than anyone else.\n\nAnd like you said, the quality of the dataset matters a lot, and there's no better data than data from actual real life application of the system, of which Tesla has 100 times more than anyone else and expanding exponentially.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "Neither - NVDA if you want an upcoming tech titan for the next decade.

{"title": "AMD and the 150B question, an in-depth look of AMD VS Intel (part 2)", "selftext": "Positions: Shares in AMD because I am a pussy\n\n**Introduction:**\n\nThis is a follow up to my original post that I made a few months ago as I promised, you can find it here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hbwcpv/amd\\_analysis\\_and\\_why\\_you\\_should\\_sell\\_big\\_blue/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hbwcpv/amd_analysis_and_why_you_should_sell_big_blue/)The following post will assume that you already read my previous post  or have an understanding of how the semiconductors work. This will cover two primary subjects, number one, Intel VS AMD and their competitive advantages, including nodes, partnerships and foundries along with how I expect things to play out over the next few years.\n\n**Intel VS AMD**\n\n*The following documents Intel’s most recent launch and the potential inconsistencies I found, please be aware that the reviewers are not at fault and should not be blamed for anything that is potentially foul play.*\n\n***Cascade Lake and a story of deception***\n\n[Intel 10900k](https://preview.redd.it/7yez283s1eo51.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2b3f1084db75351722976e4809b6f0eeb52decd8)\n\nThe x86 CPU space has two companies currently competing in it. One is the master and one is subservient, but what happens when these roles get reversed and the master becomes the underdog?\n\nThe fight gets dirty.\n\nEver since the launch of the Zen architecture, AMD has been slowly gnawing away at Intel’s market share, Zen 1 brought them back into the discussion, Zen+ consolidated their position and Zen 2 brought the fight to Intel’s crown jewels. Intel in the years since Zen launched floundered with 10nm, and now 7nm while TSMC slowly ran away with their lead in manufacturing all the while AMD continued to innovate. This left Intel with two choices, buckle down and try to work the problem, or fight dirty. They chose the latter.\n\nIn 2018, well before Zen 2 launched, AdoredTV investigated Intel and their relation with reviewers and found that Intel was most likely seeding the tech press with golden samples. The scale of this was astonishing, almost all sites that he investigated had received exceptional samples.\n\nThis was in 2018, when Intel was still firmly in the lead when compared to AMD’s Zen+ architecture. What about now? When AMD is on par or firmly in the lead with Zen 2?\n\nInspired by Adored’s Conlake video, I chose to look into any potential foul play with their newest 10900k launch.\n\n***Methodology***\n\nIn order to ensure that Intel was fairly portrayed, I looked into as many publications that I could who published their all core overclocks along with their voltages set in the bios. All in all I found 17 publications that fulfilled the criteria.\n\nAfter I had collected the necessary data, I reached out to Silicon Lottery to ask about higher bins than what they published, that being 5.2 GHz, and 5.3 GHz.\n\nThey kindly responded to me and provided this information:\n\n*“I can tell you that 1) we do not publish statistics until we reach a sample size of at least 100,*\n\n*and 2) there are a few 10900K that can fall within our theoretical 5.2GHz bin (we're talking about top \\~1% here), but a 5.3GHz bin is not possible for a 10900K under our tests.”*\n\nFrom this statement we can safely assume that their theoretical 5.2 GHz bin would use 1.4 volts as each 100 MHz bump is matched by an increase of 0.025 volts, with their highest binned parts reaching 5.1 GHz at 1.375 volts.\n\nWith that out of the way let’s move onto my findings.\n\n***Findings***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a38vi7jl1eo51.png?width=577&format=png&auto=webp&s=3dd2481044072d630ec6607e12300a9c903668f0\n\n*\\*Power draw from the wall was about equivalent to that of Guru3D, implying a voltage of 1.4 volts.*\n\n*\\*\\*JayzTwoCents did not mention the voltage used, but I felt it was important to mention him as his result was completely out of line when compared to other sites.*\n\nThe first important note that should be made is that for some of the sites, they started with a voltage of 1.35 and applied a multiplier without doing any further tuning, meaning some of these publications could have achieved a better overclocking result. Secondly, because of the nature of some reviews, I could not get as many sources as I originally intended, but 17 should suffice for our needs.\n\nWith that out of the way, we can look at a few numbers, the average clock speed achieved and the average voltage necestated.\n\n**Average all core overclock:**\n\n*5.164 GHz*\n\n**Average Voltage:**\n\n*1.341 Volts*\n\nAnd we can also determine the mean all core overclock and voltage, which will be important to ensure the results are not skewed by aberrant values such as with JayzTwoCents and Overclock 3D.\n\n**Mean all core overclock**\n\n*5.1 GHz*\n\n**Mean Voltage:**\n\n*1.332 Volts*\n\nAs we can see, both the average and the mean samples would be considered Golden samples by Silicon lottery, who have had less than 100 samples achieve similar results. It is clear that something is a little fishy here, so let’s take a deeper look into the results.\n\nStarting with Guru3D, the first result that completely blew me away, 5.2 all core overclock with only 1.35 volts applied. When compared to Silicon Lottery of less than 1% of samples reaching 5.2 GHz under their testing with the assumed 1.4 volts. Even if we are generous and add an extra 0.025 volts to ensure long term stability, Guru3D’s review sample far exceeds the theoretical requirements for a 5.2 GHz, golden sample bin.\n\nMoving onto the next stand out, Overclocker 3D, we see an absolutely astonishing result, 5.4 GHz with a voltage of 1.402. Silicon Lottery stated that they do not believe it is possible for a 10900k to reach 5.3 GHz all core, let alone 5.4 GHz. This sample is definitively a golden sample, in all likelihood, Silicon Lottery has never seen a part that can perform this well despite testing hundreds of chips.\n\nAll other chips are excellent samples as well, with the vast majority of them landing in golden sample territory or at worse, good samples.\n\nThat being said, there is one outlier, JayzTwoCents. I am not entirely sure what happened here, it is the only chip that did not make 5.0 GHz, and is the only chip that would not be considered a good bin. Perhaps some wires got crossed or he was sent a retail unit by accident.\n\n***Conclusion***\n\nMake of this what you will, but I feel that this is a clear demonstration that Intel is again seeding press with golden samples. This could have been done by them to quell the rumours that the 10900k would be a power hog or to potentially dull the edge of any potential reviews, but it is pretty clear that something is amiss.\n\nIt is also clear that Intel will continue to pull shenanigans until we call them out for it. I feel that the press should be a little more discerning or more skeptical of their results given what I have found and what Adored found in the past.\n\nFinally if you plan to buy an Intel product, please be aware that misleading information such as this is present and be aware of it.\n\n***Sources and Footnotes***\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hsc4caun1eo51.png?width=663&format=png&auto=webp&s=e6bb8325496d8e998390e3bece9234c14580db66\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The future of Intel?**\n\nAs we can see, Intel is not shy about potentially deceiving press and consumers. That being said, I do not expect to see any legal consequences come of this as it is very difficult to ascertain if this did indeed happen.\n\nThat being said, the pain has just begun for Intel. The following will encompass a brief overview of some Intel products and the major issues they will be facing in the near future.\n\n***The death of a leading foundry***\n\nIn my last post, I said that Intel would not be highly competitive in 2022. While I admit, I was hoping to get the follow up post out much sooner, what I meant by this is Intel will not have 7nm until 2022 at the earliest. That being said, with Intel’s most recent quarterly earnings, I have to readjust my personal road map for Intel, and I now believe they will be competitive again at earliest, 2023. There are a few reasons for this, and the following will be based upon leaks from Moore’s Law is Dead, AdoredTV and RedGamingTech. All three have proven to be reliable sources, with Moore’s Law is Dead predicting almost the exact performance of Intel Tiger Lake months in advance.\n\nCurrently, as we all are aware of, Intel is encountering massive difficulties with their 10nm and 7nm production. The issues are so prevalent that 10nm has been delayed for years, and 7nm will be delayed for just as long if not longer. Because of this they have been forced to delay product launches, back port architectures and increase power consumption massively to keep pace with AMD.\n\nThat being said, they cannot continue to increase power consumption in all sectors, for example, in note books, AMD recently launched their much anticipated Renoir APUs, which far exceed both press and my expectations. At the moment AMD’s solutions are notably stronger in multithreaded tasks and graphics work loads when compared to Intel Cascade Lake and Intel Ice Lake. In fact, according to Hardware Unboxed, a reputable review channel, it is not uncommon to see AMD perform at twice the level as Intel when comparing low power solutions (15 watt TDP or lower). That being said, Intel Tiger Lake is a good improvement in terms of GPU performance, outclassing AMD by \\~20% in the 15 W form factor, while still being significantly weaker in multithreaded performance.\n\nThis shows that Intel absolutely needs 10nm yesterday, they cannot continue to increase power and lose efficiency, sooner or later they will find that even though their products consume twice the power, they are out classed in all aspects. That wall will be Zen 3.\n\n[AMD 3950x](https://preview.redd.it/b5t3ptno1eo51.jpg?width=1344&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6a4e828f32c5a5efe809ab6625f5e27d4f5003cf)\n\n***Zen 3***\n\nThis will be brief as not much has changed from my previous post, and I still fully expect AMD to take the gaming crown from Intel Cascade Lake. However, there are a few small updates that I must make. Intel Rocket Lake is expected to come out Q1 or Q2 of 2021, and it will have 8 cores at most. Though I am not sure why Intel would want to max their consumer platform at only 8 cores, and not maintain 10 cores, I suspect that 10 cores may consume too much power. However, it will have a 10-20% IPC bump, which *might* allow it to reclaim the gaming crown from Zen 3, though at the moment it could be a toss up depending on how well Zen 3 scales with frequency.\n\nFurthermore, I will clarify a few things:\n\n1. Zen 3 will have a unified cache, meaning that latency should be lower as packets do not have to cross over the infinity fabric.\n2. Zen 3’s cores will have more access to L3 cache as it is unified, meaning it will have to access system memory less, thereby again improving latency.\n3. Zen 3 should have a small clock speed increase from an improved node, though I suspect it will be no more than 200 MHz\n4. Finally, Zen 3 should also have a higher f-clock, meaning it will have lower latency when accessing the system memory.\n\nAll in all, Zen 3 is a relatively iterative performance increase over Zen 2, with a 15-20% increase in single threaded performance being likely.\n\n***Big and Little cores Vs Zen 4***\n\nA few months ago, Moore’s Law is Dead detailed Alder Lake and Sapphire Rapides; Intel’s “big” comeback. The following will be a summary of what he detailed, and I strongly recommend you watch his video to understand my reasoning to what will happen: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqErX7VkitI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqErX7VkitI)\n\nThe gist of it:\n\n1. Alder Lake will be on 10nm, and will utilize “big cores” with high ipc, and “little cores” with low ipc, and low power consumption.\n2. Alder Lake will come out late 2021 or early 2022.\n3. Sapphire Rapides will be Intel’s big splash back into the data center, and will succeed Ice Lake server.\n4. Sapphire rapides will most likely have 56 cores.\n\nMy opinion:\n\nThough we have very little information on Zen 4, we know one thing for certain, it will be on 5nm TSMC. You may immediately see the issue, in my last post I said that 5nm was designed to compete with Intel 7nm, not 10nm. AMD will still have a node advantage. This along with what we know so far, Zen 4, will increase core counts substantially again, and it will be an advanced package solution, this shows that unless Alder Lake and Sapphire Rapids come out two quarters or more before Zen 4, it will not be competitive.\n\nThis is a major issue for Intel because as I detailed previously Intel’s roadmap is massively behind schedule and I believe that all products that have yet to be announced, such as Alder Lake and Sapphire rapids will have been delayed by at least a few months. These delays will be further compounded by Intel’s wording security problems forcing companies to either purchase more Intel products as a stop gap, or migrate over to AMD.\n\n***Data Center and the Cloud***\n\nIf you work in the server space, you know that security is paramount, and as I said in my last post, Intel has none of it. Now you may ask, why is Intel still selling massive amounts of CPUs to various OEMs such as Dell? Here is the reason as detailed by Mike Burzonne (who is supporting the Federal Trade Commission v Intel Corp. Dockets 9288 and 9341) on SeekingAlpha:\n\n“Average OEM price where I suspect deeper discounts are available for large volume bundles and hyperscale / cloud commercial.\n\nDesktop $283.79\n\nMobile $282.13\n\nXeon $715.04”\n\nNow the astute may see the issue, Intel is selling these for much less than their suggested retail value. Essentially what these large OEMs are doing is, buy Xeons on the cheap, burning through them in about a year, then purchasing new ones. Obviously this is not sustainable, so they are potentially looking at AMD.\n\nMike Burzonne also believes that AMD ships about 50m units per year compared to the 400m of Intel, and from this the issue is clear, they do not have enough capacity to bring on these large OEMs in any meaningful way, plus the software stack is not entirely mature yet.\n\nNow if you look at the software stack, this is a very real head wind, but things are slowly changing, when Zen 3 is released, the Zen architecture will be just about 4 years old, which is typically when you start to see software maturity at around 5 years. This compounded with improved efficiency over Zen 2 should allow AMD to make a very convincing argument to not buy Xeons. Furthermore, we also know that AMD is ramping wafer orders from TSMC thus they should be able to increase shipments and bring large OEMs on board.\n\nThe way that Intel is going to combat this is by selling Xeons on the cheap while showing off what they have coming down the pipeline to incentivise companies to make do with their current products. The issue with this is they have proven time and time again that they do not have the ability to execute, as proven most recently by the 7nm delays.\n\n***Trouble with the FTC***\n\nThis will be very brief as I do not entirely understand the ins out outs of the suit, but the reason I specifically brought up Mike Burzonne was his involvement in an anticompetitive suit against Intel for monopolistic practices as summarized in my first post. Mike Burzonne believes that total damages could exceed 20b and a 2010 revision states 88B in damages.\n\nThe reason why the charges are so slow to move is Mike Burzonne believes that the FTC and the European Union are synchronizing to ensure that the charges are proper and cannot be easily dismissed, nor will there be lasting economic tensions as Intel is a US based cooperation.\n\nIf you wish to read more about the suit, here is the 2010 revision: [https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/public\\_comments/proposed-consent-agreement-matter-intel-corporation-corporation-ftc-docket-no.9341-550006-00014%C2%A0/550006-00014-55228.pdf](https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/public_comments/proposed-consent-agreement-matter-intel-corporation-corporation-ftc-docket-no.9341-550006-00014%C2%A0/550006-00014-55228.pdf)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wbuj7srv1eo51.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=56591059f2fba92c7a47695522544882d66a2df2\n\n**Conclusion/TLDR**\n\nAs I believe I highlighted very clearly, Intel is increasingly starting to turn to more shady tactics to paint themselves in the best light possible, such as with the Cascade Lake reviews, they are losing ground to AMD in efficiency and performance, they are losing server market share and they have a potential massive lawsuit on the horizon.\n\nAll of this should demonstrate that AMD has a golden opportunity to gain massive market share as Intel toils with 10nm and 7nm.\n\nOne final thing I should note, is that the FTC lawsuit is very much uncertain, and I would be wary of basing any decisions on it.\n\nFinally, I see AMD as worth 150B in the next few years as they eat Intel’s lunch, cloud compute continues to grow rapidly, and their collaborations with Xbox and PS5 bear fruit.", "id": "iwobaj", "created_utc": 1600642674.0, "score": 165, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 73, "comments": [{"body": "When is your book coming out?  \nDoes it come with an audiobook?\n\nAlso, positions or BAN!", "score": 65, "replies": [{"body": "Added my positions, and I’ll write a book when I get motivation to finish off a Nvidia post I am writing", "score": 20, "replies": [{"body": "pls say nvidia good", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Nvidia very tricky, they did some really smart things and some really stupid things.
