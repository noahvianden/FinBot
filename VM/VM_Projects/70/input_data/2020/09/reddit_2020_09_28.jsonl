{"title": "Am I Insane? I'm going to buy lots of puts on SPXS.", "selftext": "[Leveraged ETFs](https://youtu.be/l6v3EfNVI8c?t=60) are definitely not for passive investors as obviously they are extremely volatile. Due to high operational costs and time decay, a leveraged ETF will slowly lose value if whatever index it tracks trades sideways. Since most leveraged ETFs have to be reset at the end of each trading day in order to mimic the next day's return, there's the prospect of a error developing where the ETF doesn't reflect the index over a long period of time. Many investors say to do nothing except daytrade these stocks as they invariably perform poorly.\n\nBut that is not always the case with strong growing indexes. [SPXL](https://www.bing.com/search?q=spxl&cvid=25a3a88c2c16438a9c421e27c72b157f&FORM=ANAB01&PC=DCTS) is a 3X leveraged ETF that tracks the S&P 500, and it has consistently shown real growth three times greater than [SPY](https://www.bing.com/search?q=spy+stock&qs=LS&pq=spy+&sc=6-4&cvid=13352D7A8DD040319037C11C771B15FA&FORM=QBRE&sp=1&ghc=1) which is a regular index of the S&P 500. Which is why lunatics like me will sell covered calls and trade options with these stocks regardless what some people say.\n\nBut I have a thought, what if we could have both leverage and time decay work for us? [SPXS](https://www.bing.com/search?q=spxs&qs=n&form=QBRE&sp=-1&pq=spxs&sc=7-4&sk=&cvid=E6AC3BB7843348778A40A532A40BD2B4) is a INVERSE 3X leveraged ETF tracking the S&P 500. Meaning if SPY loses 5%, SPXS gains 15%. Time decay, the index tracked, operational costs, and simple leverage all say this stock won't just lose, but it will pound the ground consistently. So... PUTS!\n\nSpecifically; inverse rolling LEAP options. Buy puts expiring in 2-3 years can be held for 6-12 months before selling it and buying a new put with a later expiration date. The extra time added is to hedge against the risk of short term downturns. Backtracking shows even during 2008-2009 recession this method could have worked or at least breakeven, assuming you didn't get paperhands. Oh yes, in spite the Covid lockdown, SPXS is at half the value it was in February this year.\n\nSo who is more crazy; Me, or everyone else?", "id": "j12qe1", "created_utc": 1601255509.0, "score": 38, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "num_comments": 75, "comments": [{"body": "Just shorted it with 100X leverage.
