It’s the same thing with autonomous driving. When the concept was first brought to consumers there was a worry that the older generations would not be comfortable with the new technology.  The savvy pioneers quickly realized their technology would be eagerly adopted by younger generations, and therefore they did not need to launch an aggressive marketing campaign “selling” people on the tech. They just needed to wait as their technology progressed and their market matured, confident that the future buyers would be there. \n\nIMHO this kind of thinking has expanded to the company’s profile as a whole. They know they have a good product, they know their target audience already knows that too, so  all those people who don’t “get it” aren’t worth spending any time or money on trying to convince them.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I'll have what he's having", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "You can't handle that much coke.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "We didn’t believe for the sake of believing; we believed because the fundamentals of TSLA were screaming at us.

The stock rallied over the last year on faith, and now faith isn't that much of a factor since they proved they could deliver on it in good faith.  This is also a very uncertain and volatile time, especially with COVID-19 resurgence across the country.  I'm honestly really surprised they were able to make the records they did despite all of this.  But big pops like you saw in 2019 are going to be far more rare until either 1.)
