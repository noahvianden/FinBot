{"title": "Gamestop, technical DD on how this gaming cycle will blow the previous highs out of the water. The second coming of physical vs digital games.", "selftext": "I’m sure everyone read enough of how management is going to turn this around but no one spoke about how the gaming console itself is going to benefit Gamestop since they deal with a lot of physical/disc sales/resale.\n\nI just want to talk about the second coming of Tesla that is Gamestop. I talk mostly about how Gamestop will boom with rise in physical game vs digital. What I talking about? I’m talking about the coming of 4k gaming. While you bitches are trying to just play the short squeeze for a price target of 50$ you are completely missing the bigger picture. We are going to easily go above the company’s all time record high made back in 2008 62.11$ without the squeeze when all said is done. (Don't forget our buddy Michael Burry managed to kill 1/3 of the outstanding shares through last years buyback) Edit: Also there's still another 101M in buy backs still not executed. \n\nBack in 2012, anyone who was a gamer can tell you how big of a POS the console launches were because of one reason. The hardware were absolute trash, it was using AMD’s CPU/GPU and everyone complained because you’re paying a premium for low tier outdated PC parts. Intel cpu was what people wanted fitted with Nvidia graphic cards. You have 12 year olds rocking PCMR (PC MasterRace) logo everywhere making fun of peasants potato console. Look at AMD in 2012, it was trading at 2$. Company probably had Donald Trump at the helm making the calls running the company into the ground like his Casinos.\n\nAnyways, this time is fucken different and even better than it was back in 2008. In 2008, cpu/gpu improvements were still doing fucken leaps and bounds year after year. The game consoles were outdated within a year or 2. In 2020, CPU/GPU improvements slowed to an absolute crawl and parts cost a fucken arm and a leg. Moores law hit a wall and getting 2x performance over last year was no longer possible and the cost for parts kept going up. You want the latest and greatest? That’ll cost you 2000$+ for PC gaming, hell no one is going to have that kind of money especially with this recession.\n\nNow here comes PS5 and Xbox Series X, giving you the latest top of the fucken line gaming hardware for 600$. M$ and Sony is losing money on this like back in 2008, you will hear every fucken reviewer praise this and tell you go out and buy it. Everyone and their mom’s going to go buy new gaming console for their kids so they can fuck off while they have sex with her boyfriend in the other room.\n\nHow does any of this benefit Gamestop? Well with now the latest and greatest gaming console and top of the line hardware we will see an actual push for 4k gaming.\n\n4k gaming to say the least is very hardware intensive and also takes up a fuck ton of storage space. What takes up a lot of storage space? 4k fucken texture packs for 4k gaming alone takes up +20gb of space. Yes that fucken storage space is going to be huge. The last generation we never had any real push for 4k gaming, fucken hell they mostly ran below 1080p to even be remotely playable at 30 FPS. You think people are going download entire games when it takes days or weeks to download with their dial up connections. No they will buy physical discs 9/10 times.\n\nMoreover anyone who plays games on console will tell you 99% that they prefer disc over digital downloads because it cost the same as digital.\n\nLastly, we all know that with the new console release there is actually a lack of new games but that matters not. All games are backwards compatible, so where does Gamestop benefit from this? Well they are only the biggest used game reseller around the block. When people go to buy the new console they are going to go to Gamestop over Amazon or Bestbuy and buy used game to play when everyone goes back into lockdown. Everyone who was planning on spending 3000 on trips oversea will be buying games instead.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyone who says they are going to go like Blockbuster and point to the last 2 quarters is trying to shill you. Everyone knew that a new super gaming console cycle was coming, they were holding off on their purchases and been saving their pennies for this. The next quarter for Gamestop is going to be its biggest.\n\nTL;DR\n\nBig push for 4k gaming will result in large files downloads incentivizing people to choose physical discs over digital.\n\nPositions. Shares and even more shares for now. After election IV Armageddon 01/15/21 30C or further out.\n\nTL;DR x2 Also for everyone saying that Gamestop will go out of business. Here’s just a quick discussion on just simply why it makes sense for Microsoft/Sony to exist. [https://youtu.be/8gEfHD\\_y7Pc?t=938](https://youtu.be/8gEfHD_y7Pc?t=938)\n\nGamestop will be their showroom, so it makes sense for Gamestop to thrive and not run them out of business. Amazon/Bestbuy/Walmart sure as hell aren’t going to advertise games for them since they aren’t a gaming retail store primarily.\n\nPS. Bunch of hedge funds trolling GME to scare you out of positions so they can cover their shorts.\n\nEdit. PPS. This is a post to argue against how people think games will go full digital and leave Gamestop to go bankrupt.

I am sorry but all my friends with the same or a little slower internet are downloading games because it is just more convenient. U think 2h in advance and buy the damn thing online... i am assuming that PS5 will have a much bigger memory storage so I do not see a reason to take a whole trip everytime u buy a game. When it comes to 20gb games you will not play that game the same day... does it really matter that much? You leave it over night", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I’m confused here. You still have to download the games through the internet even with a disk.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}
