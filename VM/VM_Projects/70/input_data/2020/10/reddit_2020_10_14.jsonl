{"title": "Care to talk GEX?", "selftext": "Today GEX (Gamma exposure) closed at its [highest level ever.](https://squeezemetrics.com/monitor/dix?) \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[S&P and GEX 10\\/13\\/2020](https://preview.redd.it/nhatmg16zys51.png?width=1901&format=png&auto=webp&s=f58fa864882dbddca066ed4ddc51ac1fd61e1a7c)\n\nNow, some of you may yell stonks only go up I don't care about gamma rays. However it is important, and can help you make money if you pay attention to it in times like this. If you need a refresher on what gamma is here is some background.\n\nAn options Delta is the chance that an contract will expire ITM. For instance, deep ITM contracts delta will be close to 1.00 because it has a near 100% chance of profitability. While an OTM contract will have deltas closer to 0.\n\nGamma is literally the derivative of delta, or the rate of change of delta. Its value will show how much a contracts delta changes when the underlying stock goes up or down $1. So if your OTM contracts delta changes from 0.1 to 0.3 when GME moves up $1 that contracts gamma at that time would be 0.2.\n\nGamma shouldn't be ignored because it shows you the rate of change of your chances of \"winning\" in real time. Imagine a coin flip where in mid air the chance of landing tails changes from 50% to 60%, pretty solid information.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What does high GEX mean?**\n\nA high GEX means the market is currently skewed towards call options. A GEX of 15,000,000,000 means that for every 1% move down on the S&P, MMs have to SELL 15B shares they bought as hedges for the calls they sold. A high GEX puts the breaks on the current market price action and means MMs expect a change to happen soon.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[SPY and GEX \\(10\\/12\\/20\\)](https://preview.redd.it/ek920p23yys51.png?width=1038&format=png&auto=webp&s=794b0f74985012c2c3771442c4154e221e979eb0)\n\nThis chart (although a day old and doesn't show the 15B spike today) shows that high GEX doesn't mean an immediate market crash. In fact in the past year GEX is only a decent indicator of corrections in the mid term future. However a GEX of 15 Billion has never been seen before and we should keep a close eye on it and DIX to get a better idea about where we are going this month.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHave some opinions on high GEX?

The math is rather tedious (need to write code for this), but you can calculate the price at which a gamma flip is expected to occur by comparing the open interest and delta for calls and puts expiring soon. \n\nWhen gamma flips from positive to negative, MM are free to sell the shares that they have been hedging with (they also open short positions).
