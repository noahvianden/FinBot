{"title": "I'm getting the fuck out of US companies. Asia will benefit regardless of what happens in this hemisphere.", "selftext": "  \n\nPositions: BABA, TCHEY, BIDU, NIO, TSM, AVGO \n\nThesis: These companies still have a big growth potential and will have success in pretty much every situation I can think of. If the US continues to rip and has a real V-shaped recovery, Asia will rip with it. If the US crashes due to a financial crisis or reemergence of a public health crisis, Asia has pretty much completely reopened, has almost no community spread, and will be a safe haven while the US tries to recover. I don't know if the US is in a  bubble or not, but I think the multi-trillion market cap of the US tech giants limits upside regardless of how well they perform. I'm also convinced the US is about get fucked by a convergence of a second wave and a bad influenza season. Even if they don't the risk of a US economic crisis over the next year is objectively high.  \n\nBABA and TCHEY: Chinese megacaps that are still valued at under $1T and will definitely eventually get there. I wish I could buy options in Tencent. They are basically Facebook, PayPal, Activision Blizzard, and Softbank combined. Alibaba still has potential to expand into the rest of Asia including India if India-China relations improve. Both companies have virtual monopolies in their main areas of business in China and are not subject to anti-trust legislation going forward like their US counterparts. \n\nNIO and BIDU: Have tiny market caps compared to their US counterparts. Google’s market cap is almost 30x higher than Baidu’s and they trade at about the same P/E ratio. I’ve already made a killing on Nio, which is valued at 30B compared to Tesla’s nearly 500B. Chinese EV appetite is also way bigger than that of the US and the recent upgrade of Nio predicts the Chinese EV market to quadruple by 2025. I expect Nio to eventually break into US and European markets. They’ve also successfully implemented battery swapping and won’t need to invest in vertical integration the same way Tesla is in trying to overcome battery charge life obstacles. Both Baidu and Nio are investing heavily in fully autonomous vehicles. \n\nTSM and AVGO: Semiconductors will continue to see growth in the coming years and it’s the only sector that I have confidence in right now. Another bonus if you choose to buy stock, both of these companies have generous dividends and can represent a decent hedge over the growth companies I listed. If the trade war heats up, they are located in Taiwan and Singapore respectively and will be beneficiaries of changes to US/EU supply chain. TSM is producing high quality chips cheaply and will be a big player in data center, autonomous driving, and AI. Broadcom just inked a deal with Apple for wireless components and will be a big 5G beneficiary. \n\nHow I’m playing it: Long-dated calls that are way out of the money in each of these positions. I’m counting on them to all at least double in the next two years. All of my calls are either Jan 2022 or Jan 2023. I also have sold out of all US stocks in my IRA and bought long positions in only in these names. The only one I’m not holding calls in is TCHEY because I use Robinhood and am not aware of any way to buy options in it.\n\nEdit: FYI the Chinese economy will likely have a major financial crisis in the next 10 years due to artificial inflation/export of deflation by their government. They also have had a housing bubble that has been building for years (watch one of the early episodes of Vice on HBO to learn about it). I think they are going to outperform the US for the next 2-3 years though because the West racks disiprine. Sorry to those who think I'm a traitor.
