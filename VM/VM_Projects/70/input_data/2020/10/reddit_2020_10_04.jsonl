{"title": "UPS all-in because... [DD]", "selftext": "# ‚ÄúBetter, not bigger‚Äù\n\nCarole Tome new CEO has stated ‚Äúbetter, not bigger‚Äù as the new motto for UPS. Profitability is the name of the game for UPS as it‚Äôs shipping volume is already exorbitant. \n\nStarting August 30, price increase of 30%\n\nfor shipping out of mainland China and Hong Kong. \n\nStarting aug 30, US worldwide expedited surcharges will be more than double what they were in April. \n\nSurcharges from Tawain, Vietnam, Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, and others to the US are up 30% beginning Aug 30. \n\nWhy that‚Äôs important? \n\nUPS operating profit grew 7.4% year over year largely due to international travel. \n\nVolume Increase of 46% out of Asia. Meanwhile, last quarter domestic profitability decreased...\n\n**What about domestic profitability?**\n\nDomestic profitability will increase over the following quarter. Surcharges are coming! $1 for ground and $2 for air at least. Reports for up to $4-$5 surcharges for peak shipping starting November going into January. These increases bode well for a shift to increase domestic profitability and align well with an important season. \n\n**Holiday season and E-commerce**\n\nDeloitte reports an increase of 25-35% increase in e-commerce over the holiday season. I think that‚Äôs quite modest. \n\nA recent online survey by Redpoint Global found 62% or respondents planned to do ALL their holiday shopping online. Factor this is with the UPS surcharges and big profits are imminent. \n\n**UPS and EBay** \n\nA little under the radar, EBay and UPS announced a deal to provide discounted shipping opportunities when using UPS. eBay is trying to shift away from USPS curing many delays and elected to aim that focus on UPS. \n\n**Anything else?** \n\nThe vaccine. When it‚Äôll be ready, who knows? When it is, UPS is the only major transporter that has certified storage capabilities to transport vaccines at the necessary temperature. It‚Äôs partnership within Operation Warp Speed is bullish. Did you see what that money did to all vaccine stocks? \n\nUPS is in a unique position as it benefitted from COVID‚Äôs initial chaos, has continued to benefit throughout due to the e-commerce shift and strong Asian demand, and will continue to benefit from the holiday season and vaccine distribution. If you need more proof look at various retail players who benefitted off the e-commerce and Asian demand shift such as Nike. Nike showed decline nationally but gained in the Chinese market. Most importantly, Nike showed an 82% increase in Online sales. \n\n**Don‚Äôt believe me? Trust the analyst.** \n\nKeybanc recently raised to Buy with a price target of $190. Credit Suissie raised target to $192. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***TLDR: UPS is increasing profitability.*** \n\n***Surcharges everywhere. EBay partnership. Plus, even more surcharges for holidays.

{"title": "Bank OZK - The \"New Century Financial\" of the current crisis.", "selftext": "Bank OZK will be the canary in the coal mine for the covid banking crisis, just like New Century Financial was for the subprime crisis. It's one of the largest and most aggressive commercial real estate lenders that few people know about. \n\nIt has ~$20B of loans outstanding, with another ~$10B of committed funding, almost all of which is for commercial real estate development. It's loans are also concentrated in NYC, LA, and Miami. \n\nThe bank started expanding aggressively in 2010. Their business model has been to buy failed banks, then plow the newly acquired deposits into commercial real estate loans. They've been funding projects other banks won't touch, but it's been a lucrative strategy in the 10 year long bull market. \n\nHowever, now the bank is stuck with a lot of loans for urban real estate that's dead. Worse still, is that lower interest rates are squeezing the bank's interest income since CRE loan interest floats on the federal rate. So despite a growing loan balance, interest income is declining. \n\nThe buying opportunity is that OZK hasn't reported the loan deterioration yet, and earnings are coming up on 10/22. The bank has ~$20B of loans, yet only $300M of bad debt reserves. Bad debt reserves only increased by ~$200M from 2019 despite a complete collapse in rents. \n\nPage 48 of the 2020 Q2 10Q is where the real info is hidden. The bank considers $83M in loans to be \"non-performing\" as of 6/30. If this seems low, that's because it is. There are $982M in loans on  short term deferrals that aren't considered troubled debts. The bank is not considering covid deferrals as non-payments or considering the loans as non-accrual status. This might've been reasonable treatment back on 6/30 when this was still a short term crisis, but now things are a different story. If only a portion of those loans can't come current, then the asset ratios of the bank will be f*cked.\n\nLink to 10Q (https://ir.ozk.com/Cache/IRCache/53e844f2-d9f4-81d1-22f2-05e5ae94ede6.PDF?O=PDF&T=&Y=&D=&FID=53e844f2-d9f4-81d1-22f2-05e5ae94ede6&iid=1005468)\n\nTLDR: Bank OZK is sitting on a lot of CRE loans that aren't paying right now. Since the COVID crisis isn't improving soon, some of these loans will go bad. The bank may not be capitalized enough to take the loses.

Look at the peer banks. It‚Äôs all the same. \n\nAdditionally their ACL & Unfunded is up, net 70mm. so I don‚Äôt know why you are looking to Bad Debt?\n\nAlso, where is your analysis of their call report, schedules HC-C and RC-R to comment on their capitalization?", "score": 46, "replies": [{"body": "The uncertainty around covid deferrals is why there's a buying opportunity. But Bank OZK is different than most banks in regards to it's reporting treatment of the deferrals.\n\nUnlike most banks, Bank OZK is not regulated by the Fed or the SEC. In 2018, it changed it's corporate structure to remove the parent holding company which allowed the bank to no longer be regulated by the SEC or Fed. OZK has also successfully lobbied the Arkansas legislature for loser bank oversite from the state regulator (https://outline.com/HnUNyR).\n\nWhat this means is that OZK's deferral reporting is whatever they want it to be, because they have no guidance and no oversite on the matter.\n\nI'm using Bad Debt and ACL interchangeably. Even though ACL is up from last year, the ACL/TL ratio is less than half where it was during the last recession.\n\nDue to OZK's org structure, they don't file reports with the Fed so no HC-C or RC-R are available. However, on pg 66 of the 10Q, you can see that management has overcapitalized the bank. But, if you back out the covid deferred loans from common equity, the ratio goes from 12.7% to 9%. Then if you add the unfunded commitments due within the next year to the Tier 1 assets, the ratio drops even further to 7.5%. Then, if you reweight the covid NPLs according to basel III (150% rather than 100%), the ratio drops to 6% - well below the minimum requirements. \n\nMoodys did a similar analysis back in April which called out OZK (pg 10). While the analysis was looking at the capitalization impact of customers maxing out lines of credit, the methodology relies on OZK's unfunded loan commitments so it's still useful.\n\nhttps://www.moodysanalytics.com/-/media/article/2020/unfunded-commitments-capital-impacts-in-a-crisis.pdf", "score": 34, "replies": [{"body": "Excellent reply, tbqh\n\nAre you sure they are no longer SEC/Fed?

Furthermore, non performing loans count at 150% of value towards TRBC vs 100% for performing loans. So as loans go bad, the numerator goes down and the denominator goes up. I calculate that it will take $1.5B of losses for OZK to trip the 7% threshold, at which point the bank will be p into receivership by the FDIC.
