{"title": "Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, October 29, 2020. Please enjoy!", "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, October 29, 2020**\n\nStocks rose today, reversing course after being deep in the red the last two days. Market participants digested a record increase in third-quarter GDP for the US, a better-than-expected weekly unemployment report, new coronavirus restrictions in the US and Europe and a slew of corporate earnings for massive companies.\n\nThe Nasdaq (QQQ) rose 1.75% today, the best performing of the major indices. The S&P 500 (SPY) finished 1.05% up and the Dow Jones (DIA) finished 0.44%.\n\nAfter coming off one of the worst quarters in US history, the economy rebounded, growing at its fastest pace ever. Gross domestic product (GDP), a measure of the total goods and services produced from July to September of this year, expanded at a 33.1% annualized pace, according to the report by the Department of Commerce. The gain came after a 31.4% plunge in the second quarter and was better than the 32% estimate from economists surveyed by Dow Jones. The previous record was the post-World War II 16.7% surge in the first quarter of 1950.\n\nToday, the US Department of Commerce released its weekly unemployment report, showing that another 751,000 individuals filed initial jobless claims, better than the 770,000 estimated by analysts.  Continuing claims, which refer to individuals that are currently receiving unemployment benefits who filed for unemployment benefits at least two weeks ago, was 7.75 million, slightly better than the 7.77 million expected. According to Yahoo Finance, this report represents the ninth-straight week initial unemployment claims have remained below 1 million and continuing claims below 10 million, a key indicator that the economy is recovering, though not as fast as many would like.\n\nIn Europe, countries are still struggling to contain the recent surge in coronavirus infections. Both France and Germany announced renewed lockdowns spanning for about the next month, though the restrictions stopped short of the draconian measures announced earlier on during the pandemic. In the US, the seven-day average of daily new cases rose to a record 70,000 as of yesterday, according to data compiled by the Washington Post.\n\nOn the vaccine front, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation‚Äôs top infectious-disease expert, said he believed it would take until at least January for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to authorize a COVID-19 vaccine. There are five companies (Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Moderna (MRNA), Pfizer (PFE), Eli Lilly (ELY), and BioNTech (BNTX)) in the final stages of study for a coronavirus vaccine, with Pfizer Inc. and Moderna Inc. having fully enrolled their trials, Fauci said.\n\nSome analysts consider the recent pull-back in the stock market a healthy inevitability, given the strong rally that took many stocks to all-time highs earlier in the Month. Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial Network, said in a note to clients, ‚ÄúMarkets have been baking in a lot of optimism: that the pandemic was under control, that the economy was healing, and that things would be back to something approaching normal in 2021. Those assumptions were always optimistic, though, and what we are seeing now is a reality-based repricing. As such, this drop is both necessary and healthy. Markets should reflect the most likely future path, not the most optimistic, and that is where we are headed.‚Äù\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Today is going to be a huge day in earnings:\n   * Amazon (AMZN) reported better-than-expected earnings.\n      * EPS of $12.37 vs $7.41 estimate\n      * Revenue of $96.1 billion vs $92.7 billion expected\n   * Apple (AAPL) reported better-than-expected earnings\n      * EPS of $0.73 vs $0.70 estimate\n      * Revenue of $64.7 billion vs $63.7 billion estimate.\n   * Alphabet (GOOG) reported better-than-expected earnings and went up 5% in after-hours\n      * EPS of $16.40 vs $11.42 expected\n      * Revenue of $38.01 billion vs $35.35 billion\n   * Facebook (FB) reported better than expected earnings.\n      * EPS of $2.71 vs $1.91 estimate\n      * Revenue of  $21.5 billion vs 19.6 billion estimate.\n      * Daily Active Users of 1.82 billion vs 1.78 billion expected\n   * Twitter (TWTR) missed user-growth expectations and as a result, the stock dropped 9% in after-hours.\n      * EPS of $0.19 cents vs $0.06 estimate\n      * Revenue of $936 million vs $777.15 million estimate\n      * Daily Active User of 187 million vs 195.2 million estimate\n* Disney (DIS) is closing its Disneyland Paris theme park at the end of the day as France initiates a fresh round of restrictions meant to curb a rising number of new Covid-19 cases.\n* Pinterest (PINS) exploded after beating-earnings up 26% at the time of writing\n* Pinterest (PINS) with several price target increases from Barclays, Wedbush, and Robert W.

{"title": "The Election, SPY, and Your Retarded Positions", "selftext": "Alright retards, next week is the election and we are all wondering what the fuck is going to happen. I am going to be your autistic Nate Silver to guide you to Tendie town. To understand what could happen from a market perspective, we need to see what has happened after elections of the past. \n\n**TL;DR: Buy SPY Puts on Tuesday at close. If election is contested, BTFD after a week or so.**\n\nSo first off what happens the day after an election you might ask? I went back through SPY's illustrious history and pulled what happened the day after the election going back to 1996. \n\n   \n \n\n[SPY Performance Day after Election](https://preview.redd.it/j1290wvuy2w51.png?width=621&format=png&auto=webp&s=0021f22ff10f594e87c0c208d2d3a938d94813b3)\n\nThe last three elections SPY has had a red the day ranging from .8% to 1.2% down. Assuming that trend continues and SPY is around 335, a -.98 day would put spy at 328, plenty of room for SPY weekly puts to cash. That's just for the day though, what about the rest of November?\n\n   \n \n\n[Election Year SPY November Performance](https://preview.redd.it/nmsdqaewy2w51.png?width=634&format=png&auto=webp&s=47cdb07ff4ec4495f3dfef10e958c184033fe8a3)\n\nBill Clinton's election during the .com boom reigns supreme at 6% gain whereas Obama's election when the country was in shambles lead to a -10% at the end of November. Trump's surprise victory over Hillary lead to a 3% gain by the end of November. Surely by now you've noticed the mark of 2000 and -8% when Florida couldn't get its shit together.\n\nSince we are expecting both sides to either contest the election OR not even have a winner due to mail in delays, we could see another 2000 scenario play out. The Supreme Court resolved the 2000 election on December 12th after about a month of uncertainty. **From the day after election close to the resolution, SPY tumbled from 140.56 to a Low of 129.75 (-8%) and ultimately made a 6% recovery from 11/30 to 12/12. So if SPY closes at 328 and we have an 8% uncertainty crash that would take SPY down to 301 before it recovers to \\~320.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sdksss2sy2w51.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=e30e2cea1a2fccf7483dd3a95a0f09b08a42aba4\n\nLastly, to gauge the anti wisdom of the crowds effect of the WSB genius mob, I threw a poll out and 56% think it will be Big and Red. The last 3 elections have been red the day after but WSB thinks it will be Red too soooooo who knows what the fuck that means.   \n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9tadvxwoy2w51.png?width=658&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e4fd365c737a6781b81f5b56633f5d1d60ad423\n\n**Conclusion**. No matter who wins, markets will probably open \\~1% Red which gives plenty of SPY strikes the ability to hit. If the election is contested, wait about a week for the bottom and BTFD with everything on sale.
