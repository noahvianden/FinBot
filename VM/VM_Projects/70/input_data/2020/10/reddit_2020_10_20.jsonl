You really want to say Iâ€™m wrong/dumb/donâ€™t know anything because I said the put play on ER isnâ€™t worth it, when a spread couldâ€™ve made some money. I get that. We have different idea about what makes a trade worthwhile. Iâ€™m saying â€˜worthwhileâ€™ but I think youâ€™re reading it as â€˜making any profitâ€™, and so Iâ€™m â€˜wrongâ€™. Fine. \n\nThe original comment was a response to OP who was saying that a NFLX miss portends â€˜the death of WFH stocksâ€™. I was just pointing out this is normal for NFLX, and that it usually shrugs it off and hits a new high before the next ER. If you look at the chart we can both see itâ€™s happened several times. Thatâ€™s IMO where the easier higher reward trade is. Sure - do a put spread for the next ER if that 80 or 100% excites you, but while youâ€™re waiting 3 months for that consider the other trade I mentioned.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Just stop typing, you don't know what you're even writing.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Iâ€™m done for now unless you have any other questions ðŸ˜˜", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "zzz", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "Did you watch Cuties on Netflixs?
