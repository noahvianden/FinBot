That might be cool but they are too expensive to bet on, or for theta gang, you'd want to be sure the company exists in 5 years.\n\nHere's 12 of the cheapest Jan 2022 Call LEAPS that's around 95% OTM.\n\n|Ticker|Stock Price|Strike|Bid|Ask|PctOptionStrike|% OTM|Vol|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|BAC|$25.3|$50C|$0.2|$0.21|0.4%|97.6%|135|\n|JPM|$101.02|$195C|$0.72|$0.86|0.39%|93.0%|108|\n|TAK|$17.82|$35C|$0.05|$0.15|0.29%|96.4%|46|\n|CSCO|$39.85|$75P|$0.16|$0.18|0.23%|88.2%|30|\n|GILD|$63.78|$120C|$0.51|$0.61|0.48%|88.2%|25|\n|CME|$169.35|$330C|$0|$0.4|0.12%|94.9%|24|\n|EPD|$17.04|$32C|$0.03|$0.17|0.25%|96.0%|21|\n|HAS|$89.21|$170C|$0.81|$0.94|0.46%|90.5%|18|\n|AFL|$38.16|$75C|$0|$0.25|0.13%|96.6%|15|\n|CVX|$74.07|$140C|$0.13|$0.8|0.35%|89.0%|12|\n|USB|$39.08|$75C|$0.25|$0.44|0.27%|91.9%|11|\n|AXP|$106.22|$200C|$0.8|$1.09|0.5%|88.29%|5|\n\nImagine you're wheeling a promising stock. There's always a chance the stock blows up 40% in a month (happened to me with LTHM), and it might never drop back to the range where you were wheeling before.\n\nHere's where these cheap LEAPS come in. At such low prices of 0.2% - 0.5% of strike price, a weekly 0.3-0.4 delta covered call or short put typically pays for one of these 90% OTM Call LEAPS with change to spare, and these are valid for another 15 months.\n\nThese options are found using [FDscanner](https://fdscanner.com/) (disclaimer I built it), with the scanner parameters\n\n\\- Expiry Jan 2022\n\n\\- % OTM: 85% - 99%\n\n\\- Option Price/Strike Price: 0-0.5%\n\n\\- Calls only\n\nThese LEAPS will give you the peace of mind that some upside is captured even on extreme upward movement. You could also set the scanner to find less OTM calls eg (45%-55%) at a higher cost, or find companies with cheap 50% OTM puts. Or increase the Option Price/Strike to a larger range (eg 0-2%) to find more companies.\n\nDozens more companies fit the criteria: BUD, KRE, BUD, T, MPLX, SCHW, though their option volume is just 1 - 5 for Friday. Possible the number might break 3 digits but is not captured on the scanner due to them having 0 volume for that day.\n\nAlternatively, try to think of positive black swans for companies in the list. Eg a company trading at deep value, or is at cyclical lows, upcoming major product launches, pharma companies, etc.", "id": "j9j5oy", "created_utc": 1602472047.0, "score": 331, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 76, "comments": [{"body": "BAC last traded at $50 in 2007..\n\nI mean anything is possible, but considering the world is probably going to see continuous lockdowns until March, who is to say what latent fallout will finally manifest by winter next year. 2008 played out over several years", "score": 100, "replies": [{"body": "Hes talking about buying the $50 call for 2022 then selling weeklies or monthlies against it.
