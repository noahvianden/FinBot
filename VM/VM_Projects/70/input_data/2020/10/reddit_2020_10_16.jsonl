It does not, from my understanding of these comparisons, suggest to me any kind of innovative technological processes moving them forward. It somewhat reminds me more of Apple under Tim, where it was a very business oriented increase in shareholder value rather than raw productivity; instead of coming out with something that blows the mind they came out with the ability to enhance the wallet, is all.\n\nStill, the whole picture seems disproportionate, the net income isn't null during the last few years / quarters so it can't be a pure RD environment. I admit there would be a lot more research into the company on my part to be able to come to a real conclusion, and I have actually done that research before, it takes weeks to really understand it all and put together a meaningful picture.

It's really something that they're trying to build on for the future for the next generation of VR devices.\n\nPS5 has been a massive money-pit until it finally can recoup those losses (complete re-design of UI, Store, App alongside all the hardware changes) - and the acquisition of studios lately with $500M thrown into an investment stake of Epic and the purchasing of Insomniac\n\nSony films were finally starting to turn the corner with some good movies - just as COVID came in and wrecked them.\n\nThere just seems to be a lot of positives right now. I can't imagine the R&D that went into a relatively small (compared to the likes of MSFT, APPL) tech company making an electric car which is so far out of their usual wheelhouse.\n\nThese are a lot of things to be excited about for Sony should:\n\n- their EV ever see the light of day and be viable\n\n- VR catches on as more computers and systems can handle it with more ease / less choppiness \n\n- Gaming continues to dominate (this is basically inevitable)\n\n... And who knows? Maybe Spatial Reality takes on its own little niche for professionals in the art / design worlds. They restructured and became, essentially, an American company. And it's paying off for them.\n\nAnd just to add at the end, the games coming out over the next year...\n\n- Ratchet and Clank\n\n- Horizon 2\n\n- Spider-Man Miles Morales\n\n- God of War 2\n\nThese 4 games alone are all Sony exclusive IP and all profits from their sales will go directly to Sony. And the retail of each will be $70 ($50 for Spider-Man) which adds another 16% profitability on each sale - and then these are all going to sell at an extraordinary rate.\n\nIf I had to guess? Combined 25 million sales in the first year. Only limited by the number of PS5s that they will be able to get into the hands of consumers.\n\nThey've spent crazy money to launch this console with the best games lineup of all time.

Cornering your own product is one thing, certainly, but in the bigger picture where does Sony fit? \n\nI don't doubt that you are correct that there will be money. There is always money. The question is how it manages to pay off relative to time; if their IRR was 6 years and it takes 8 that's a huge miscalculation against them. Also, they basically need to careful of simply building better mousetraps (fasted SSD, for instance) because that is not technology that can't be cloned. Yes, it'll have demand as #1 right now, but it's essentially the mission of everyone else to do the same thing who is in the space. \n\nThat's why the flatness of the revenue concerns me.

My main reasoning is that it is easier to not make them that way and also gives \"market power\"; you don't have to worry about people straying because the have to own a PS[X] to use it. \n\nThat's why it's interesting to see it compared.
