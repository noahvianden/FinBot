I've seen a number of posts like this, with many comments saying it won't make a difference because they won't actually be forced to deliver the shares.\n\nMy main question, is if they don't seem to ever have to deliver the shares...could that have a damaging effect on a squeeze?  Instead of covering while it squeezes, they just hold until the post squeeze crash.  Would love to have a better understanding of how this works.  I understand that this supposedly means they would have to produce the shares, but what are we looking at in reality?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oyahc5mh43v51.png?width=706&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a8e0692c8f282f5a30122ffb0f24914f1262a54", "id": "jhdsb1", "created_utc": 1603563590.0, "score": 48, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 73, "comments": [{"body": "Whenever a trade is made, both parties in the transaction are contractually obligated to transfer either cash or assets before the settlement date. Subsequently, if the transaction is not settled, one side of the transaction has failed to deliver. Failure to deliver can also occur if there is a technical problem in the settlement process carried out by the respective clearing house. \n\nFailure to deliver is critical when discussing naked short selling. When naked short selling occurs, an individual agrees to sell a stock that neither they nor their associated broker possess, and the individual has no way to substantiate their access to such shares. The average individual is incapable of doing this kind of trade, but an individual working as a proprietary trader for a trading firm and risking their own capital, may have the ability to carry out such an order. Though it would be considered illegal for them to do so, some such individuals or institutions may believe the company they short will go out of business, and thus in a naked short sale they may be able to make a profit with no accountability.\n\nSubsequently, the pending failure to deliver creates what are called \"phantom shares\" in the marketplace, which may dilute the price of the underlying stock. In other words, the buyer on the other side of such trades may own shares, on paper, which do not actually exist.", "score": 41, "replies": [{"body": "So what happens in the musical chairs game when the music stops, if you're left holding a phantom share?", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "'I don't know' is probably the best answer anyone can give you. I cant say I've seen something like the GME situation before. More shares shorted than shares exists is perplexing. The dilution of the price seems correct, as there is more shares in the marketplace than what should be. GME is probably under valued at $15 as a subsequent result of this excessive shorting.\n\nAn example I can think of is precious metals paper contracts. There is currently more paper contracts for silver than there is physical silver in the marketplace. If everyone wanted to have their paper contracts delivered as physical silver, the task becomes impossible. What you would get in return would not be the physical silver you technically own on paper, but a cash equivalent to the value.\n\nThe shorts would obviously have to pay out what they owe to anyone holding shares they sold short, even if the shares don't technically exist.

Each share is worth the same amount of the company that it was before.\n\nSay there are a million shares outstanding and the company pays a million dollars in dividends.  So each share gets $1.  It doesn't matter if there is 100% short interest -- in that case the shorts pay the other million dollars and each share still gets $1.

I googled it and found this paper http://counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:~:text=Fails%E2%80%93to%E2%80%93Deliver%20%E2%80%94%20If,the%20DTC%20as%20if%20it. here's a brief summary from it. \"Fails–to–Deliver — If a short seller cannot borrow a share and deliver that share to the person who purchased the (short) share within the three days allowed for settlement of the trade, it becomes a fail–to–deliver and hence a counterfeit share; however the share is transacted by the exchanges and the DTC as if it were real. Regulation SHO, implemented in January 2005 by the SEC, was supposed to end wholesale fails–to–deliver, but all it really did was cause the industry to exploit other loopholes, of which there are plenty (see 2 and 3 below).\n\nSince forced buy–ins rarely occur, the other consequences of having a fail–to–deliver are inconsequential, so it is frequently ignored. Enough fails–to–deliver in a given stock will get that stock on the SHO list, (the SEC's list of stocks that have excessive fails–to–deliver) – which should (but rarely does) see increased enforcement. Penalties amount to a slap on the wrist, so large fails–to–deliver positions for victim companies have remained for months and years.\n\nA major loophole that was intentionally left in Reg SHO was the grandfathering in of all pre–SHO naked shorting. This rule is akin to telling bank robbers, “If you make it to the front door of the bank before the cops arrive, the theft is okay.”\n\nOnly the DTC knows for certain how many short shares are perpetual fails–to–deliver, but it is most likely in the billions. In 1998, REFCO, a large short hedge fund, filed bankruptcy and was unable to meet margin calls on their naked short shares. Under this scenario, the broker dealers are the next line of financial responsibility. The number of shares that allegedly should have been bought in was 400,000,000, but that probably never happened. The DTC — owned by the broker dealers — just buried 400,000,000 counterfeit shares in their system, where they allegedly remain — grandfathered into “legitimacy” by the SEC. Because they are grandfathered into “legitimacy”, the SEC, DTC and prime brokers pretend they are no longer fails–to–deliver, even though the victim companies have permanently suffered a 400 million share dilution in their stock.\n\nThree months prior to SHO, the aggregate fails–to–deliver on the NASDAQ and the NYSE averaged about 150 million shares a day. Three months after SHO it dropped by about 20 million, as counterfeit shares found new hiding places (see 2 and 3 below). It is noteworthy that aggregate fails–to–deliver are the only indices of counterfeit shares that the DTC and the prime brokers report to the SEC. The bulk of the counterfeiting remains undisclosed, so don't be deceived when the SEC and the industry minimize the fails–to–deliver information. It is akin to the lookout on the Titanic reporting an ice cube ahead.\"", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "[GME FTD's - 2nd half of December](https://i.imgur.com/CGQTzVB.png)\n\n6 million shares. 6 million!", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "SO we are talking about 1.8 billion dollars at todays valuation and those 6 million shares are only about 10% of the fraudulent GME share in the system.

This difficulty happens because these contracts often involve substantial volumes of assets that are pertinent to the long position's business operations.\n\nIn business, a seller may pre-sell an item that they do not yet have in their possession. Often this will be due to a delayed shipment from the supplier. When it comes time for the seller to deliver to the buyer, they cannot fulfill the order because the supplier was late. The buyer may cancel the order leaving the seller with a lost sale, useless inventory, and the need to deal with the tardy supplier. Meanwhile, the buyer will not have what they need. Remedies include the seller going into the market to buy the desired goods at what may be higher prices.\n\nThe same scenario applies to financial and commodity instruments. Failure to deliver in one part of the chain can impact participants much further down that chain.\n\nDuring the financial crisis of 2008, failures to deliver increased. Much the same as check kiting, where someone writes a check but has not yet secured the funds to cover it, sellers did not surrender securities sold on time.
