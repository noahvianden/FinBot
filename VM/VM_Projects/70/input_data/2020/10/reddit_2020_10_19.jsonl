{"title": "Insider Trading Program", "selftext": "[https://github.com/lhwolff15/InsiderTrading](https://github.com/lhwolff15/InsiderTrading)\n\nRecently I’ve been focusing on how to tell if insiders in a company anticipate a potential upside or downside to their company. As the great Peter Lynch once said: “insiders might sell their shares for any number of reasons, but they buy them for only one: they think the price will rise.” I couldn’t find a data source that compiled all the buying and selling data for companies, so I made one. I created a Python script that picks up Insider Trading transactions for all publicly listed companies. I just completed it so I haven’t had time to test out the impact insider trades have on the stock price, but I thought you guys might think it was a cool source of data. Let me know what you think!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUPDATE:  Just wanted to share my resulting spreadsheet. Interpret the data as you will!\n\n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x2K-HKcFTEmgnEslvYEz2j3XZ9PHe2fj/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x2K-HKcFTEmgnEslvYEz2j3XZ9PHe2fj/view?usp=sharing)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI wanted to include a link the page where the data is drawn from on the SEC site (the table on the bottom of the page).

That way you don't get unintended side effects.\n* Rather than asking people to go thru your script and replace variables, it would be better to structure this as a CLI. Lots of tools choose from for making a CLI but I think the simple solution works best in this case:\n      1. Set all those variables that you want users to change as params to insider_trading\n      2.

Fast-algos (not HFTs) use computers to parse the filings the second they hit EDGAR and will trade it near instantly (but this is true of nearly all Edgar filings). \n\nLastly, Peter lynch is wrong. There are *absolutely* scenarios where a ceo will make a big open-market acquisition of stock as a simple ‘fuck you’ to the sell/buyside. IIRC, the founder/chairman of OSTK used to buy big slugs as a ‘fuck you’ to the shorts......and then lost like 70% over the next few years (this was back in the early 2010s.

{"title": "Here is a Market Recap for today Mon, Oct 19, 2020. Please enjoy!", "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, October 19, 2020**\n\nStocks fell after the sell-off accelerated in the last hour of the market, as market participants closely monitored development for a near-term stimulus package and rising coronavirus cases in Europe and the US. \n\nThe Nasdaq (QQQ) finished the day 1.63% down. The S&P 500 (SPY) finished the day 1.49% down and the Dow Jones (DIA) ended the day 1.34% down. Stocks finished deep in the red after the last hour sell-off.\n\nOver the weekend, there were several developments regarding a coronavirus-relief package. In comments to reporters in Nevada, Pres. Trump said “I want to do a bigger number than she wants \\[Pelosi’s $2.2 trillion proposal\\]. That doesn’t mean all Republicans agree with me, but I think they will in the end. If she would go along, I think they would too, on stimulus.” These comments imply that Pres. Trump is willing to propose a higher number than the $1.8 trillion the White House proposed recently. While Republicans have consistently balked at such a high price-tag, maybe Pres. Trump’s endorsement can help move the needle.\n\nIn response, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi set a Tuesday deadline for reaching an agreement with the Trump administration to pass stimulus before the November election. She and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, another key negotiator, reportedly continued to have discussions over the weekend and are scheduled to meet again today. Drew Hamill, Pelosi’s spokesperson said, “While there was some encouraging news on testing, there remains work to do to ensure there is a comprehensive testing plan that includes contact tracing and other measures to address the impact on the virus on different communities.”\n\nAccording to data from John Hopkins, there were 57,000 and 48,000 new cases recorded on Saturday. While this is a marked improvement from 69,000 cases on Friday (the highest one day total since late-July) the numbers appear to be stagnating around the 50,000 new cases per day. The South and the Midwest have been the most hard-hit regions.\n\nIn Europe, there has been a surge in cases, with health and government officials warning of a second wave and imposing new restrictions throughout the continent. The Republic of Ireland will move into \"Level Five\" restrictions from midnight on Wednesday, the country's highest COVID alert level, for the next six weeks. Switzerland and Italy are imposing a nationwide mask mandate in all public spaces, even outdoors from Monday. In England a three-tier system remains in place, with varying restrictions imposed depending on whether an area is on \"medium,\" \"high\" or \"very high\" alert. London is an area of “high alert” meaning members of different households cannot meet in indoor spaces and restaurants, bars have a 10 p.m. curfew, and a ban on gatherings of more than six people. In France, nine cities, including Paris, have been placed under a 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Ally Financial (ALLY) had price target raises by Piper Sandler, BMO Capital, and Morgan Stanley from $31 to $34 at OVERWEIGHT, $34 to $36 at OUTPERFORM, and $31 to $38 at OVERWEIGHT, respectively.\n* NextEra Energy Partners (NEP) had price target raised by Credit Suisse from $60 to $69 at OUTPERFORM\n* Snapchat (SNAP) had price target raise by KeyCorp from $29 to $35 at OVERWEIGHT\n* Texas Roadhouse (TXRH)  had price target raise by Wedbush from $71 to $82 at OUTPERFORM\n* Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY)  was upgraded by Guggenheim from NEUTRAL to BUY with a target of $70\n* GoodRx (GDRX) had coverage initiated today by a myriad of analysts. mixture of targets ranging from $50 to $70 from Neutral to Buy.\n* ConocoPhillips to buy Concho Resources in an all-stock deal valued at nearly $10 billion\n* AMC announced it is resuming operation in many theaters in state of New York, starting October 23\n* ConocoPhillips  to buy Concho Resources in an all-stock deal valued at nearly $10 billion\n* Unions representing over 10,000 Disney theme park workers have told California Governor Gavin Newsom that the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California, can safely reopen when its location moves into the state's \"orange tier\" of COVID-19 test positivity and adjusted case rate.\n* NASA gave Nokia-owned (NOK) Bell Labs a $14.1 million grant to build a 4G network on the moon to help astronauts control lunar rovers, navigate lunar geography in real time, and stream videos.

But they def do this with brand names drugs) \nStep two: say insurance will discount the drug 500% (still 10x the price/cost) \nStep three: customer usually pays this price because they are “using their insurance” and “getting a deal”\n\nMeanwhile, drug discount companies (GoodRx) can come in and just made deals with manufacturers and allow maybe 5x markup. They get a cut, and manufactured gets a cut. Customer wins because drug is cheaper than insurance (if they have it).\n\nNow because insurance pays more for the drug, they can make more profit. Insurance profits are limited to something like 20% of their total revenue (might be 15%?). Because costs keep going up, they keep making more money, and they get to claim they are “getting you a deal”, it’s not their fault everything is getting so expensive, but it kind of is. Drug companies and hospitals know they negotiate, so they charge more than they want originally.\n\nSorry end rant. Point of story, this industry is pretty profitable.
