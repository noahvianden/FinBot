{"title": "Cruiselines will most likely collapse in the coming months", "selftext": "I'm talking to yall autists that either thought of taking a position or already have one in anticipation of cruises recovering. CCL, RCL ans NCLH\n\nHere's the timeline.\nMarch- covid season 1 started. Caused mass panic and chaos, dropping all these 85+% each of these tickers in a race to drop to zero. All the heat and headlines hitting cruises and putting alot of pressure on these 3 to shut down. Shortly after they announced a 1 month closure.\n\nApril- as the market continues to drop from covid these stocks keep dropping but they eventually hit their bottom range and autists start buying in with anticipation that covid isn't that bad and they'll start sailing by summer.\n\nMay-June- summers starting. Strict enforcement no no sailing is pushed on these. Essentially missing out on the Alaskan season and prime time of their cyclical money making months. They still rally in hopes a cure will come out or some shit\n\nJuly-aug- no good news but autists are trading hard and heavy thinking that words like dilution and no business is great stuff.  Gotta buy em cheap.\n\nSept- now- still a shutdown order in effect till end of Oct. Lol. For real if you're still holding congrats.  You missed out on thr tech sector run and have been in purgatory for months.\n\nRest of 2020- absolutely not going to start up. If trump wins possibly q2 next year. If biden wins prob q3 as dems hate cruises.\n\nTrue recovery- never. Theyre constantly having to tap into the shareholders as a piggybank. Raising massive amounts of coupeus debt. Even when thet do start sailing. Theyll be underwater as its extremely doubtful that people will rush onto these boats until they know its 100% safe. At best 50% occupancy for 2021.\n\nRight now the stocks are most likely trading way higher than they should and realistically should have been close to or near the levels they were in March or lower. Only thing holding them up are autists waiting for prior highs which fundamentally shouldn't exist with all the dilution.", "id": "j98n4q", "created_utc": 1602434372.0, "score": 11, "upvote_ratio": 0.6, "num_comments": 71, "comments": [{"body": "> its extremely doubtful that people will rush onto these boats until they know its 100% safe.\n\n\nLegit not sure if I believe this part", "score": 73, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 116, "replies": [{"body": ">puts on grandpa  \n\n\nlmoa underrated comment", "score": 6, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Cruises will be FILLED with Trumpers and Covid naysayers.
