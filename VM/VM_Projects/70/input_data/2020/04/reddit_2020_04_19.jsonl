{"title": "Some thoughts going into this week", "selftext": "Looking for some spirited back and forth from my fellow reddit investors and capitalists. Feel free to rip me, or drop an \"atta boy\" -- That's why we're all here!\n\nDisclaimers: I'm not a FA, and don't pretend to be one. New to reddit, but not to the market. Securities I  currently own are **bolded** so you can check my bias. :)\n\nWMT - Talk about a ship that has been steady through the storm. I sold all of mine back in 2016, fearing cuts to entitlement programs would essentially cut their workforce by 30% overnight. Those cuts never came, and now I want back in.  Grocery pickup and delivery has been the future for a while, but COVID seems to have fast tracked that transition. IMO, it will remain highly popular post pandemic, Walmart will expand on it, and 5 years from now >70% of grocery sales will be a direct competition between them and **AMZN**. I'm taking this one as soon as the right opening appears, with the expectation of holding it long term.  \n\n**KO** \\- First share I ever bought, never let it go, added to it over the years, and might be adding more tomorrow.  Not much to say here. It's priced well and has a scheduled earnings report before opening bell on Tues.  The recent relative success of consumer markets (WMT, **AMZN**, **TGT**, COST) leads me to think that will be a positive report, and if I see nothing indicating otherwise, I'll try to stock up and ride the wave.  Big fan of **PEP** as well -- more diversified than **KO**, but KFC/Tacobell/PH will probably slow any aggressive gains for a while.\n\n**MSFT** \\- Grain of salt time. This is my favorite holding on the market, bar none. **MSFT** and **AMZN** have essentially held up the whole average during this rebound period. It's all about those beautiful beautiful clouds y'all. (military contracts don't hurt either, see **BA**...) It's always a good time to buy Microsoft. \n\nGOOG/**GOOGL** \\- has a bright future in similar areas to **MSFT**, but I hate companies that live and die by advertisement revenue. For that reason I have a very limited holding in only 1 out of the 2, and I stay away from FB and TWT as well.  ITS ALWAYS A GOOD TIME TO BUY MICROSOFT.\n\nT and **DAL** \\- like Coke, they both have earnings to report this week. I think Delta will produce a decent report which will confuse some who don't fully understand that the pandemic split quarters, and much of the carnage won't be known until the end of Q2. If it does bump up, I'll offload shares and buy back lower in the early summer. **DAL** has the best balance sheet as well as the second best executive team in the whole airline industry, and I don't see it going anywhere. T on the other hand looks to be primed for injury if they report negative earnings.  If they fall back below 26, I'm an AT&T buyer all day long. \n\nNFLX - If it were my money, I'd wait for the (very likely) record high earnings report coming up, ride the wave, and sell high.  I'm not a fan of companies who can't seem to be profitable despite overwhelming popularity. Average NFLX account is accessed by >8 users, but only paid for by 1. New competitors emerging. The whole company model just sketches me out. Go prove me wrong Netflix.... but I'll continue to pass for now.\n\nSNE - Gaming has grown in quarantine, Playstation 5 is set to release in the next 2 months, and the stock still has solid rebound potential from its high. I'm at a solid buy here, and I've never owned it before.... so thats exciting!\n\n**V** and **MC** \\- Every single reputable study shows that the very first debt people default on in a recession is their credit card bill. BE VERY CAREFUL HERE.\n\nTSLA - Volatile, Bullish, Enigmatic.... I have no idea what's happening here.  Tesla fanboy's overwhelming enthusiasm make market predictions hard. I'll buy if it drops below 580 again. Don't own any now. Damn sure wish I did....\n\nOther stuff I like right now - **BA**, **JNJ**, **LOW**, **SAVE**, **TDOC**, MDT, HD, **ABT**\n\nOther stuff I'm neutral on - **PG**, LUV, DIS, **NKE**, SHOP, **AMD**, **Oil stocks** (will likely go even lower next month), and **many many many others**.....\n\nOther stuff I hate right now - **AAPL**, cruise lines, or any company that can't survive another big dip. Nobody knows if it's coming. be smart.\n\nDo your thing Reddit, Have a spectacular week, and GOD BLESS AMERICA!", "id": "g49lz5", "created_utc": 1587310484.0, "score": 66, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 70, "comments": [{"body": "V And MA are just payment processors, what do they care if people default on credit card loans... the banks are the ones to suffer here.", "score": 40, "replies": [{"body": "Exactly.

Wanted to counter on V and MC, they are just network providers, if someone defaults it hurts the bank that issued the card, not the networks.

Thats why a lot of mom and pop stores are still cash only even wayyyy out here into 2020.\n\nDebt limits on cards as well as inability to get new card from a bank because you just defaulted both destroy that big transaction fee at the point of purchase IMO.

This is is pretty fundamental to every purchase you make, but more so if the market has just fallen off a cliff. Great brokers can scan a yearly report and figure this out pretty quickly... I definitely can't, so I use a few metrics that have proven successful over time. The following three show relative strength: \n\n**Quick Ratio:** \\>1 - better than simply comparing broad assets with broad liabilities\n\n**Cash-Debt Ratio**: >2 - realistically I want this to be VERY high in recession\n\n**Debt-Equity Ratio**: <1 - This is to make sure a company is buying assets responsibly\n\nperhaps most importantly, I always examine their performance in the last downturn. how quickly did they recover? Did they fall a second or third time? Is that same board of executives in control now?\n\nAfter strength and past trends I look at company valuation BEFORE the downturn. This isn't really as important for Bluechips. If a bluechip stock is strong financially, and devalued because of a falling market, I buy. However If you are unsure about a company it would benefit you to figure out if they were overvalued prior to the fall. You can do that with the following:\n\n**Find the P.E.G. ratio** \\- This will indicate the if the companies value was stronger before the recession or at some point in the future. important for growth rate. \n\nAnother great one to use is the **Price-Book ratio** to see if outstanding shares in a company are still valued higher than what it's worth on paper (total assets minus total liabilities). There are dozens more. You have to find ones that you personally trust, and even more importantly-- the situations when one of your Go-To indicators doesn't apply.\n\nLastly, Buy what you know. This is the most important advice I can give in uncertain times. I'm in the medical profession, and I know my way around that sector very very well. So when the market smokescreen is up, and everyone is confused, I put my money there because I understand it. I know whats going to be around in 25 years and what wont. TDOC for instance. I bought my first 10 shares in 2017, for right around 25 bucks each.
