{"title": "A High Level Guide to Trading Unusual Options Activity", "selftext": "Hey all, I've received a good number of requests to post a guide on how exactly one trades high volume unusual options activity. I'll keep this fairly high-level, and I encourage those who are inspired by this post to do more research on the subject. My goal is to give you guys a guideline one where to begin your studies, but I'm not here to teach you guys outright on how to trade Unusual Options Activity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What is Unusual Option Activity?**\n\nUnusual options activity occurs when a certain contract on a specific series experiences unusually high volume. Generally volumes above one to two thousand on smaller cap stocks or in the tens of thousands for larger more liquid equities. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What is UOA good for?**\n\nUOA is primarily used to see institutional option order flow in order to piggyback off their plays. Institutions are smart, richer, and have far more resources than your average retail investor, so piggybacking off of their plays will usually net you a profit 9/10 times. Insider trading is a lot more common than you think, and sometimes you can see institutional order flow to predict big stock moves before they occur.\n\nUOA is NOT useful for ETF's such as SPY, QQQ, or USO. I don't care how smart an institution is, no institution can predict the market. Even Bridgewater Associates, the largest hedge fund in the world headed by Ray Dalio, experienced massive losses during the current COVID-Crash. SPY is not going to hostilly takeover Apple. USO will not be bought out by Netflix. IWM is not going to have a shitty press release and tank after earnings. Stop burning your cash through trying to predict ETFs\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**How to Scan for UOA**\n\nThere are many services that can scan for UOA, but you guys all have google and I'm not going to shill products. Personally I use ToS's built in scanner. If you're interested, there are many videos on the art of scanning for UOA. \n\nOne thing of note, websites like BarChart are good for a general picture, but never trade based on options activity found on BarChart alone. It does not show individual order flow and you have no way to tell if they were selling, buying, opening or closing positions. Plus they update super slowly so you'll miss out on trades anyways. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Things to Look Out For**\n\nAnalyzing UOA is more of an art than a science. It really requires an understanding of different types of option spreads, MM behavior, option pricing, and fundamental analysis. It by no means is an easy way to make money and it is very difficult to differentiate hedges and bets. UOA is NOT the holy grail of trading, or else other people would have already jumped in on it. That being said, with proper risk management and a well developed set of financial skills, it can be a great supplement to an existing trading strategy. With that out of the way, here are general things to look out for.\n\n* Volume to Open Interest\n   * Understanding the Dynamics of volume and open interest is a great way to determine whether orders are opening or closing. \n* Bid/Ask Spread\n   * Bid/Ask Spread analysis will help you determine how aggressive orders were and whether or not order flow was buying or selling. \n* Days till Expiry\n   * This is the best method to differentiate between hedges and bets, but it is not an exact science and is sometimes very subjective until the trade runs its course. \n* Implied Volatility\n   * Sets expectations of Institutions\n* Charting\n   * Option orders leave footprints in the form of MM orders. Learn these.\n* Option Spreads and Strategies\n   * You MUST have a deep understanding of every option strategy. These are critical to determine direction of bets. \n\nAnd that's about it. UOA is a difficult strategy to master, but once you know what you're doing it can be a consistent and profitable strategy. \n\n**TL;DR**: if you're reading this then this post isn't for you.

I recently got into UOA plays after profiting bigly on $GILD and $SHAK. Like you said, UOA plays don't work on Index funds and I found this out the hard way after taking some losses on $SPY and $IWM. But overall this is an amazing starting point for someone like me. I just have a couple questions if you don't mind me asking. \n\n1. While ETF plays are bad when doing UOA, would you still consider it to be important to do analysis on ETF movements as they, from my experience, seem to influence the movement of stocks?  \n\n2. Do you trade in anticipation of catalyst events or try to avoid them? I've been hesitant to make Earnings plays based on unusual options activity and was wondering if they're even reasonable plays to make. \n\n3. what are your thoughts on my current plays? All of them are derived from my own research into UOA plays combined with some TA as well as research into any possible catalyst events. These are all small plays (2 contracts) that I bought with the profits from my $GILD and $SHAK plays to test the waters. \n\n- $SPCE 20c 5/1 - I noticed repeat call activity on multiple strikes for 5/1 and decided that the safest bet would be at the 20 strike. After doing some TA, it seems that SPCE is trading on a rising channel so I bought at the bottom and am up 44% so far. \n\n- $PLAY 12c 5/1 - 3,000+ contracts were purchased at open expiring next friday at the 12 strike. I had mixed feelings between if this is a hedge or bet and made a bet on this being a bet based on how close the expiry is. It also seems that PLAY is trading on a falling wedge pattern with a breakout to be expected soon. I'm up about 7% on this one. \n\n- $ACC 25p 5/15 - It seems you also got into this play but my reasoning for getting into this was the fact that I noticed that ACC was trading in a downward channel and was luckily able to buy in at $0.95. I'm up 63% on this one. \n\n- $DAL 24c 5/15 - I have mixed feelings about this one, an order was placed above $1M expiring in 2 weeks. The main deciding factor was the size in terms of cost and volume along with the relatively close expiry. Other than that that I did some TA and it seems like DAL is trading in a falling wedge.

Tell me why I'm wrong.", "selftext": "Following an up 27% year and a 9 year bull market, the SPY ended December at levels some would call \"bubblicious.\"  There were good reasons to support high valuations - low rates, accomodative fed, massive share repurchases, lots of leverage, accomodative fiscal policy, little sign of inflation, and a business-friendly administration to name a few.  But everything changed with Covid19.  The economy almost halted and I don't need to cite the rest.  \n\nWe're now down 12% for the year on the SPY despite the fact that we're in the midst of the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression.  Sure, the market has priced in the immediate bad economic news in current numbers and the unprecedented monetary and fiscal stimulus.  But at -12%, the market is saying \"this ain't so bad, and it's going to go back to normal soon\" and it just isn't so.  \n\nAn overlevered economy facing a mild contraction is scary.  We sit in an overlevered economy in the middle of a massive contraction.  There are two things that the market doesn't appreciate in my view:  1) The lockdown will be over soon but spending (consumer and biz) will not return to normal for a year or more.  2) related to that point is the fact that economic underperformance is going to drag on for 1 year+ (probably much longer given the contraction that is coming).  \n\nThe market is betting that the Fed Put has once again saved investors.  What the market doesn't get is that the Fed can't make people spend money.  The Fed can create an environment conducive to spending, and it can influence psychology to a degree.  But the fed can't make my wife want to go out to dinner.  The Fed can't make us take a vacation.  The Fed can't make that CEO invest in a new plant.  You get the idea.  \n\nThis market will go much lower when investors start to sense that the Fed is powerless to stimulate aggregate demand - it is pushing on a string.  The Fed Put isn't going to rescue us this time.  And an overlevered economy with lots of excess capacity is going to be deflationary.
