At one point in February, shares were up more than 220% for the year. They fell 72% from their high to a low of $10.49. The stock was almost $13 before Jonas upgraded it. He referred to the stock as the “great space coaster” in his report.

In theory, a cross-country flight might take only an hour.\n\nJonas values the space tourism business at $14 a share and the hypersonic flight opportunity at $10 a share to arrive at his current target price.\n\nThe $10 hypersonic value is built on a belief that the market for ultrafast flight could hit $800 billion by 2040.
