I also saw some videos on how infectious the disease was, in addition I saw the drastic measures China took. This deeply concerned me as I knew shut downs as the one China imposed would have massive economic affects. I began to liquidate my positions. I had made very strong gains.\n\nI then heard about the news what happened in Korea and I figured EVENTUALLY this disease would be worldwide, and I figured the longer countries waited to react the worst it'd get. So I started thinking about companies that would do well during COVID19. And here is my list:\n\n* Amazon: People will still need products, more and more will  turn to eCommerce people still need products.\n* Netflix: I figure people will need something to do, this could be a good investment\n* Clorox: consumer brand that deals effectively with the disease.\n* 3m they produce a lot of PPE (honestly this wasn't my smartest play)\n* Kroger: I figured restaurants would be shut down however groceries will be in higher demand\n\nI stayed away from healthcare stocks as I wasn't confident which one would benefit or which one would drop\n\nStocks I'm considering as this virus progresses\n\n* Boeing: Its an American staple and it will be bailed out.\n* Ford/Chrysler/GM: Those are staples of the American economy who have taken big hits, they aren't going go anywhere.\n* Best Buy: They turned themselves around and have great leadership, obviously as consumer spending took a hit they went down but I'm confident in their ability to survive.\n* Expedia: Its ultimately a tech company that deals in Travel obvious due to COVID 19 they lost a ton in terms of value but I think  as we recover people will be looking to get out and travel. Since they are a tech company I'm confident in their ability to rebound. Although I'm sure many travel/hotel related companies may not survive, I'm confident Expedia will bounce back\n* American Airlines/Delta: They are American staples and even if they need to bailed out they will be. And one things resume to normal they'll bounce back and I feel as if they could be a good value.\n\nMy plan is in the next few weeks to buying positions in those above stocks.
