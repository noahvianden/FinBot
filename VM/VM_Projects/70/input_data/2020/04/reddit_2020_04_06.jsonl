It’s just a hell of a lot worse due to covid 19. Market cycles are natural, ups and downs are good. But if you have year after year, increasingly aggressive policies to bolster the economy you end up building a castle on sand. Most politicians here thought “What’s that? I can enact aggressive short term policies that would post pone an economic decline? Well we can’t have that while I’M in office.  Buy buy buy, sheep people! This is the new paradigm that will go up forever due to our endless spending and rock bottom interest rates.”\n\nThen a fundamental event happens that stops the irrational growth.

Sure the old and weak die, but we free up trillions of dollars in pension debt while they’re at it.”\n\nEven if the most cut throat, soulless policy was enacted to ignore covid 19, the economy would continue to spiral out of control due to the long overdue nature of this decline. It’s like the economy was a car in a marathon race. The politicians are driving and the car is running low on gas. So they decide to slam a bottle of 190 proof grain alcohol and piss in the intake for a nice little boost. Yeah, that won’t have any consequences. They won’t fall behind the pace! Not on their watch. \n\nThe engine is fucked, if everyone pretended the engine wasn’t fucked and continued to piss in the intake, it wouldn’t help.

All is well!\n\n“So what do I think and what prediction am I going to put in writing? I think that that this dead cat could be over without doing much more than testing the W200 if anything else about the fundamentals starts eroding - anything that signals that Q3/Q4 aren't going to see an orderly snapback after quarantine. I think it's pretty unlikely that it's too wrong to short now because the risk of getting squeezed hard on a backdrop of worsening American mass tragedy is probably low - there's a window for us to range and wait to see if that next fundamentals shoe drops. \n\nI would be wary though that the dead cat could push higher - certainly mean reversion on distributions in the 1h-4h timeframes would do so - but long is a minefield. So, I like shorts on retests of the W200, and if we push higher, new attempts at shorts as soon as we struggle to pass a volatility pivot between 2700-3000. \n\nI'd also be wary of long options / long VIX / long volatility approaches. IV crush before any downtrend resumption, and/or a downtrend that occurs more slowly and consistently than before thus at lower realized volatility, is a huge risk for overly greedy bears right now. It's not necessarily the case that long volatility is wrong given just how bad some of the potential icebergs in front of us are, so much as I would want those two trades to be sever-able such that the long volatility trade can be closed cheap if its wrong. Low-volatility bearish erosion would actually be one of the easiest markets to trade (in my opinion), so you definitely don't want to shoot that opportunity in the foot by getting, say, stuck in long puts that underperform because of volatility crush. \n\n\nI have a pretty hard time believing we can go through a month this tragic and expect a stock market rebound on that backdrop, but ranging and compressing? Yes. That scenario is one where this news gets digested as we wait to get more information about how worried we should be about Q3-Q4, and absence of more news would be \"bullish\" (and by that I mean a much larger dead cat, not that the bear market would be over). \n\nHere's the thing though: anything that involves pushing back above the W200 means going back into a price area that describes the past few years. You could call that a return to normalcy with perhaps a garden-variety recession... which I think is crazy just with what we know already: \n\n- It is unlikely that this pandemic past its peak isn't an ongoing, rolling seasonal issue until we have an effective vaccine probably sometime next year (and a much darker timeline involves this being like a new seasonal flu that mutates every year needing new vaccines but is 10x as deadly)”", "score": 0, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "Agree.
