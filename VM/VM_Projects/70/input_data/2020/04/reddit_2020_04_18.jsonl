{"title": "Amazon will disappoint earnings.", "selftext": "**TL/DR**: Amazon overestimating delivery times is a sign of weakness. I believe everyone will be disappointed by their earnings report, and their stock will decrease right after earnings.\n\n**Position:** I trade with a cash account, so no options. Bag holding an inverse daily index ETF position (not leveraged) that's down like 18k, and I'm crying everyday the market is rallying because of decay.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**My Reasons:**\n\nIf you try to order from Amazon right now, it tells you 2-3 weeks estimated delivery time with/without prime, but the shit still comes pretty fast, like 3-4 days for most stuff that are considered non-essential. However the estimated delivery time is giving regular people the illusion that Amazon is busy af, and that their orders are through the roof, but I don't think it's the case. And they are reassuring themselves of the logic because \"everyone must be ordering Amazon right now\".\n\nAre they busier than before? Yes. Are they busy enough to justify ATHs? I don't think so. However regular people that want to get into investing are seeing those long ass delivery times, thinks Amazon will crush their sales, and are FOMOing into buying them lately, driving the stock to ATHs.\n\nAs well, Amazon has shit profit margins outside of their own products, they make little margin on stuff such as toilet paper and essentials, which is what everyone is panic ordering. What they excel at is being as efficient as possible with their ordering/delivery system, which probably only got less efficient due to changes in people's ordering patterns, as well as having to conform to somewhat stricter sanitary regulations. This can also be seen again with their 3-4 weeks estimated delivery times, their algorithms to make shit as efficient as possible is not optimized right now, meaning their crap profit margin got crappier.\n\nAnd before people talk about AWS, I understand people think every company and their grandma is upgrading their server capacity, but it's still a small % of their revenues, somewhere like 13% last year. As well, do you think every company is going to be flocking to upgrade their servers when their POS sales are dropping like a brick and they need to cut operating costs to offset it?\n\nDisagree? Leave a comment and discuss. I'm not changing my position so I'm not going to be trading on this news, meaning I don't have skin in the game. Just want to hear other views.\n\nEdit1: I am personally bullish on Amazon longterm, I think they will come out ahead in the future post-corvid because bigger companies are only going to get bigger. I'm merely talking about right now in the next two weeks.
