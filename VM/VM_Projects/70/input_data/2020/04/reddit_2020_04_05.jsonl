{"title": "OIL SHORT/LONG & NATGAS LONG - DD - FUTURES", "selftext": "Good morning all! After doing some crazy analysis on /CL and /NG i have noticed some additional opportunities for you autistic individuals... smart people need not apply.\n\nFirst let's take a look at some TA on /CL and some news revolving around the commodity.  For those of you that need a little spoon-feeding, this is Light Crude Oil Futures, contracts trade in 1000x multiple.\n\nNow that we got that fuckery out of the way... Let's get into the deep shit:\n\n/CL has bounced off support around 20 dollars with strong bull balls moving the price up like a stampede of hungry prostitutes.\n\nRecent news that fueled these prostitutes?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jes6fr49r0r41.png?width=748&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e514ea2703b5172fc5c6646dbe7459711d8e95f\n\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/02/us/politics/trump-russia-saudi-arabia-oil.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/02/us/politics/trump-russia-saudi-arabia-oil.html)\n\nSo, Trump wanted lower prices for oil but now is in panic because prices have spiraled out of control.\n\n[https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Oil-To-Move-Above-41-If-Trumps-Tweet-Is-True.html](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Oil-To-Move-Above-41-If-Trumps-Tweet-Is-True.html)\n\nUnfortunately, he has ran into some serious issues... Meeting with Texas oil prostitutes... they did not accept the idea of cutting output.\n\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/daneberhart/2020/04/03/pressure-from-president-trump-market-spurs-new-talk-of-oil-cuts--among-producers/#42ffa7776f5c](https://www.forbes.com/sites/daneberhart/2020/04/03/pressure-from-president-trump-market-spurs-new-talk-of-oil-cuts--among-producers/#42ffa7776f5c)\n\nSo, lets go back to TA - Red lines tell you everything....\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dloeiizms0r41.png?width=1628&format=png&auto=webp&s=408ab4e39126889c3e4757f117c5c3129e1da6e2\n\nSo we should see a nice bounce on /CL before we see any major dip below 20's, this is supported by many TA and other indicators. After a slight bounce we should see further decline in price of oil as we go into a storage issue.\n\nThis was posted 6 days ago.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ah6ys8g6t0r41.png?width=890&format=png&auto=webp&s=1183932ac7ca0befaae09254759022fd01a4921f\n\nWhile all of that is happening. /NG also known as NATURAL GAS is benefiting from all this fuckery.\n\nLet me explain:\n\nThere are more people at home now than ever. People are cooling and using their furnaces... they use NAT GAS. Also, as wells begin to close due to oil capacity.. there will be less NAT GAS available.. Increasing prices.\n\n[https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/natural-gas-oil-aeco-wcs-wti-1.5520910](https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/natural-gas-oil-aeco-wcs-wti-1.5520910)\n\n[https://www.ft.com/content/e0ae0be9-e2d8-4c35-a3f3-93cef149edc1](https://www.ft.com/content/e0ae0be9-e2d8-4c35-a3f3-93cef149edc1)\n\nNAT GAS has bottomed out and shows major signs of recovery... while looking at the option chain.. we notice this...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t3tnr8ost0r41.png?width=1644&format=png&auto=webp&s=c07ad8be9d38386f63d05b275ccc16860461f3c4\n\nTheres a huge disparity in /NG prices. So we should see a flush to 2's very soon.\n\nPOSITIONS:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r1zpl0w3u0r41.png?width=415&format=png&auto=webp&s=43bb54f092779c4168d79e2015559325fbf3f688\n\nRemember Futures contracts expire 15-25 days ahead of regular expiration....\n\nFlair me up if you are happy with what you see. I will try to respond to as many questions as i can.\n\nTake a look at my other OIL SHORT posts:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ffd6cz/oil\\_crash\\_of\\_2020\\_dd/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ffd6cz/oil_crash_of_2020_dd/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fnmttb/oil\\_crash\\_of\\_2020\\_round\\_2/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fnmttb/oil_crash_of_2020_round_2/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUPDATE:\n\n[Exited Position due to CME issues with 140&#37; profit. ](https://preview.redd.it/grvk9tcwiar41.jpg?width=1215&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d19483db91bf56de2d0e5ff7194dace2209a3795)\n\nTARGET ALMOST REACHED: 4/7/2020 - 11:04AM\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/er40b032ver41.png?width=1213&format=png&auto=webp&s=6eed0515487db6b69e997de9cda18b63b671f7fc", "id": "fvfytz", "created_utc": 1586102205.0, "score": 64, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 73, "comments": [{"body": "It’s a shoulder month... heat load is over pal.

Even if people end up using slightly more nat gas while the total supply starts going down it’s not going to have the effect you are predicting as most people have their nat gas price locked in for long periods of time so people getting in now while prices are low are not going to be subject to any relative short term price increase, and moreover in this specifically very bad situation, it would take a proportionate increase in demand based on the decreased supply to make the price go up and there is no chance of such demand increases. Supply is being cut because gas companies can’t survive with the cost expenditure, but even if the price goes up, they are still losing money on the remaining production. Prices would have to go up to literally 65$/barrel equivalent for most to break even and that increase is way to big. The game for them is to cut supply and hope they have enough cash to ride out losses for a few months until things turn around. If they don’t then they go belly up...this is pretty much the only reason Russia would even do what they did, because US was getting the benefit of Russia and opec keeping production down and just pumping relentlessly at max output forcing the burden of loss on them. Russia found a clever way to reverse the burden, even though it’s costing them, it can ride out just long enough to start sending US nat gas producers into cutting production and then many into bankruptcy. It takes a lot of time to restart production so inevitably when prices do rise, it will be Russia who takes most advantage of this (and saudi probably) while most of US and nat gas get fucked.
