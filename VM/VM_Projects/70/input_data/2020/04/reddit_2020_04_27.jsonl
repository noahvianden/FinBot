Specifically, by roll out I mean I buy to close the current LUV put and then sell to open June 19 put at the same strake (at the same time).  I'm also selling a call at the same strike (27.5) with the expiration  (June 19).  This creates a \"short straddle\".  Received  $430 credit.\n\nMore earnings trades later today.  And you if you haven't figured it out yet, I'll be selling calls and puts.   If I have a slightly bullish stance (ie. think the stock will go up) I usually sell two puts and one call.

This is now a put credit spread (bullish trade).  Same thing with AMZN.\n\nLUV naked put is now in the money, which is fine (like I said I don't mind buying 100 shares if I get assigned).    If IV (aka volatility) goes up a little I will probably sell a call.\n\nIV has gone down in many underylings (stocks) and the job report comes out friday so I may close a lot of positions before the end of the week.IV dropped a ton in MSFT and TWTR:Closed MSFT (bought to close the call and put) for $150 profit (74% profit)Closed TWTR (bought to close call and put) for $80 (64% profit)\n\nNew trades:**\\*Beginner trade:**  I think CLX will keep going up and CLX IV rank is 28-ish.  A year ago this would be high IV, but in this market it could be debated if this is high or low.  However, I think IV will go up again in the future in CLX.  Thus, I bought a call.  However, I rarely if ever just buy a call.  I also sell a call.  This creates a call debit spread.  Research indicates this is strategy has a higher probability of profit, and research also indicates the most profitable call debit spread is to buy the (approximately) 60 delta call and sell the 40 delta call approximately 45 days out.  Also, it costs less than buying a call.  Here was the trade:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/azbrtepknzw41.png?width=481&format=png&auto=webp&s=f290809934c05c24c11f5d7cf8948e867cfb6e23\n\nIf i had just bought the 195 strike, june 19 call it would have cost $960.  This trade cost me $635.\n\nOther trades (I actually made this yesterday and closed it today because IV dropped and I made 50% profit, just didn't have time to post it yesterday):\n\n[For $60 credit](https://preview.redd.it/rvhkupfynzw41.png?width=481&format=png&auto=webp&s=838700d50ff4f150d804a33aeb231801a90206c5)\n\nI'm going to look at earnings trades later today (for companies announcing earnings throughout the week) and will post those.  Looking at the ones with the highest IV like PTON, ATVI, GM, BUD, ETSY, BYND.\n\nMight do a YOLO play as well.

However, those who saw my comments below or were on discord saw my comments about Tesla (TSLA).  New people love to trade \"sexy\" companies like Tesla.  ...But you never know what Elon is going to say and the swings in price are very unpredictable.  This is why I avoided TSLA and typically avoid companies like TSLA.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n5/1:\n\n\\*\\*Trade:\\*\\*AMZN\t1\t15-May\t2120\tput\t(bought put)\n\n    \\-1\t15-May\t2130\tput\t(sold put)\n    \n    \\-1\t15-May\t2500\tcall\t(sold call)\n    \n    1\t15-May\t2510\tcall\t(bought call)\n\n**Cost**: Received $265\n\n**DTE**: 14 days (which is about as short as I go).  45 daysish out required to much \"buying power\" (ie. them holding to much of money as sort of collateral that I then couldn't trade with).\n\n**Strike prices**:   TLDR: I wanted to sell options in AMZN because vol is high, but AMZN share price makes that to risky of a trade (very high $$ potential loss).  I limited potential loss (and also some of the credit aka $ I received) by also buying options.Longer: Based on delta.   Sold the 20 delta put and sold the 15 delta call.  This is a slightly bullish trade.  Generally speaking a 16 delta call or put is 1 standard deviation out.  I will explain this later.  But I considered doing selling a 16 delta call and a 16 delta put.  However, I think the stock might go up so I slightly shifted the strike prices to a more bullish trade by moving the put up to the 20 delta put (higher strike price) and the sold call to the 15 delta (higher strike price).  However, have a naked call (ie sold call) and a naked put  (ie sold put) in a $2300 stock is to risky for me (and not allowed in my small account for Reddit) because if the trade goes against me (ie. goes really really bad) I could be required to sell 100 shares of AMZN at 2500 if AMZN goes and stays above 2500 or sell 100 shares of amazon at 2130 if goes and stays below 2130 (and I don't have any amazon shares).  So I bought the put at the next lowest strike and bought the call at the next highest strike.  Max loss now is around $700.\n\nIntermediate level explanation:  I thought about doing a strangle but did an iron condor instead to reduce risk.\n\n**Why this strategy:**  I noticed AMZN volatility was still high after earnings (which is not common).  I expect volatility to come down over the weekend.   The ideal scenario for this trade would be that vol drops to 0 and the stock price stays the exact same.\n\n**What helps me in this trade:** Time (ie. every day that passes), decreased volatility or no change in volatility, AMZN stock price staying between 2130 and 2500.\n\n**What hurts me:** Increase in vol, stock price going above 2500 or below 2130.\n\nProbability of profit if hold this to expiration: \\~65%\n\n**Trade hack:** If you are selling a call or put you can estimate the chance of profit by subtracting the delta of the call or put from 100.  Example, selling the 20 delta put has an 80% chance of making a profit.\n\nNote: Sometimes delta is in decimal form (ie. 0.2 instead of 20) or negative for puts (ex. -.2).\n\nFor those that are interested in a more advanced (mathematically) explanation of how \"expected move\" of a stock/underlying, [here](https://www.tastytrade.com/tt/shows/from-theory-to-practice/episodes/expected-move-differentials-05-31-2017?_sp=7a27c31e-dfb7-4381-bc40-9d4bc8be1bdc.1588349151313) is a good video\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n4/30:\n\nI'm terrible with technology.

Now that my tech naive self finally figure out streaming and uploading YouTube videos I may answer questions and go over trades there.  I'll post a link here if I do.\n\nIf you have a specific question (or comment) about a video it might be easier just to comment in the YouTube comments.\n\nAlso, if people are interested I can try and do a live stream this afternoon, just let me know.

It gone up since i opened the position and is now at 49.  I'm watching this one (I set alerts so I don't have to literally watch), but if it C stock hits 55 I'll make an adjustment.  Specifically, I'll \"roll up\" the sold put.  Meaning that I sold a put with strike price of 35.  If C hits 55 ill buy to close that put and sell to open a new put with a higher strike price.\n\nGeneral advice after talking to some people who work for me: If you don't have a ROTH IRA and you are eligible to open one, you should do that ASAP.  Even if you only have $100 to put in it.  Happy to explain why if you want.  Eligibility is based on a couple things (students loans, annual income, marital status, etc.) but if you are single will make under $124k in 2020 or married and will make under (combined) $196k you are definitely eligible.\n\nI opened a new account with $5,000 to show how I would (and will) make trades in a smaller account.  I realize some of the trades I posted here are a little complicated, so I'll definitely make some basic trades and post those.  Also, I know the livestream had some technical issues and in retrospect some of the things I talked about were more complicated than I had planned, but I'm happy to do another one and answer questions or actually make trades.\n\nI'll also keep track of profits/losses, mainly because I feel like there are a lot of scammers out there who try and sell all sorts of stuff that falsify trades and profits\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Live stream** will be at 3:00 pm (EST) [here](https://youtu.be/DaZZWLPO7Mg).  No set plan, so come and ask any questions.  Especially very entry level or beginner questions.\n\nUpdate for **4/28**\n\n**Updated Discord link** [here](https://discord.gg/PP2Cnk)\n\nThoughts:  All trades from yesterday appear to be profitable (or will likely be profitable outside of some crazy event).  Meaning that I'm not going to do anything with those trades (ie. I'm not adjusting them).  A mistake I made when I was younger (that typically led to losing money) was constantly tinkering with trades.  But all of my trades have time to their advantage, so now I just wait.\n\nI had a request on discord to do some more simple trades.  I have to do some work to do during the day today (and everyday) but will take a break at **3:00pm to stream live where I will demonstrate some trades and answer questions.  I will post the link here and discord.**  To the people that I asked, I use the TastyWorks platform and will give examples on there.  I have no affiliation with them, but if you are going to download it you can use my referall and I think you get something free (link [here](https://start.tastyworks.com/#/login?referralCode=3WVKA3VKT6)).\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**4/27**\n\n3:15 pm.  That might be all my trades for today.  Since I trade mainly based on mechanics and odds of potential profit it doesn't take me much time to find/place the trades.   Plus I have real work I do most of the day, trading is just a nice break.   But I am looking at a few more trades before close.  I'll update if I make them.\n\n**Earnings trades:**\n\n**LUV** naked put:\n\nSold the May 18th put with strike price 27\n\n**Cost**: $95 credit.\n\n**Strike price and DTE**: I'll explain in the why this strategy part.\n\nWhy this strategy: To extremely and way overly simplify...in general there is more money to be made by selling puts vs selling calls for reasons that don't really matter at this point.  But you can basically thing about it like a put costs more than a call.  So when you sell a put, you get more credit ($) than selling a call.\n\n\"Hey mbhudson1, you sold a naked put in an airline? Isn't that a bullish trade meaning that you think the price of the stock will go up after earnings?!  You realize nobody is flying right now, right?\"\n\nAnother good question person that doesn't exist.\n\nIn this circumstance I'm using an interesting strategy that not a lot of beginners typically know about.  In the long run I don't think airlines are going out of business, especially LUV.  At some point I plan on buying stock in LUV.  Ideally I would buy at the bottom of the market, just like everyone else wants to do.  However, nobody can predict the bottom.   So what i'm doing is selling a put with the full expectation that this might expire in the money and I get assigned 100 shares of stock.  This is almost always how I buy stock because it's sort of a win-win.\n\n**Scenarios**: LUV stock goes up: I keep the $95 LUV stock stays the same: I keep the $95LUV stock goes down a little: I keep the $95LUV stock goes below 27 (and is below 27 on May 15): I now own 100 shares of LUV....and I keep the $95.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\n\n**C (Citigroup) strangle**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bdpdqwxtmev41.png?width=401&format=png&auto=webp&s=2923b30ea8dee436c113bf0bcfa27a83e0daa7f3\n\nAlso not a beginner trade, but you could turn this into an iron condor.\n\n**Cost**: Received $170 credit\n\n**DTE**: I could have done this for a shorter DTE since it's an earnings play, but 53 days out is much less risky for naked options.\n\n**Strike prices**:   Picked strike prices that are outside how far the stock price is estimated to move after the earnings announcement.   This can be estimated several ways, but I just went with closest call and put to 15 delta (which is around 1 standard deviation out).  I could have gone even farther out on the strike prices (ie. higher call strike and lower put strike) to be less risky, but there is very limited profit potential in a lower priced stock (lower compared to something like SHOP) when you get out to 5 and 10 delta options.\n\n**Why this strategy**:  Volatility almost always goes down after an earnings announcement.   Instead of trying to bet on which way the stock price will go on the earnings announcement, I'm essentially just betting that it won't go below 35 or above 55.\n\nOther strategies here:  I considered a ratio spread (which I can explain to beginners later) and also just considered selling a put.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\n\nThis is not a beginner trade FYI.  I'll let you know when I do what I consider beginner trades.\n\n**Iron condor in SHOP**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xyai5w26fev41.png?width=401&format=png&auto=webp&s=86c5ac485abeb2570ac7a293a79e583389c87dc5\n\nFYI: In case you don't know -1 means it's a sold options contract +1 means i bought a contract.\n\n**Cost**:  I received $605 credit for this trade.  This does require a lot of buying power (ie. collateral).\n\n**Days to expiration** (DTE): I do most options trades around 40-55 DTE.  I'll explain why later.\n\n**Strike prices**:  I like to sell calls and puts out of the money.  Specially I like to use what is referred to as delta to determine which strike prices to sell.  Typically I sell 10 delta calls and 5 delta puts.  It might sound complicated but the delta is given in many trading platforms (here is an example on Tasty Works: [https://ibb.co/ThkKqnM](https://ibb.co/ThkKqnM)).\n\n\"Hey mbhudson1, you said you like to sell calls and puts and that -1 means it's a sold options contract.  Why are there also bought options in your trade?\".   Good question person that doesn't exist.  Selling a call and put in SHOP  (which is called a strangle) is to risky for me.  Selling an option alone is called a naked option.  Naked options have a lot more risk (technically unlimited potential risk).   By buying a call at a strike price higher than the sold call and by buying a put at a strike lower than the sold put I have made this a \"defined risk\" trade.   I do sell naked options many times, but typically not if the underlying (ie stock) price is in the triple digits.  A lot of big time options traders lost a lot of money on naked calls in TSLA back in Feb.\n\n**Why this strategy**:  I'm betting on volatility dropping here.  SHOP currently has relatively high volatility.    I can tell that by looking at the implied volatility rank which on an overly simplified level is where the volatility ranks today vs days in the past.  Right now it's at 67%.\n\nAlso, time is to my advantage here.  If nothing else changes (volatility, price of SHOP stock, etc.) every day that goes by I make money.\n\nPlan moving forward on this trade:  If I make 50% profit I will close this trade.  To close this trade I would buy the 930 call and buy the 385 put while selling the 960 call and selling the 300 put.  If the trade \"goes against me\", I will defend it but will wait until that happens to explain it.\n\nSummary of this trade:  I try and use as many things as possible to my advantage.  In this trade time is to my advantage, decrease (or no change) in volatility is to my advantage, and changes in SHOP price don't really effect anything (unless they are massive like to 930 or 385).  When you hear people at r/wallstreetbets complaining about how everyday their calls or puts are decreasing in value...i'm one of the people on the other end of those trades.\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "g95c2l", "created_utc": 1588008958.0, "score": 212, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 122, "comments": [{"body": "That’s so wide that the BPR is probably the same for a strangle.

Much like teaching college classes it's difficult for me to know what people know and don't know as well as what they want to learn and even what I could be more clear on.  \n\n\"I believe the market is right most of the time\".  I'm not sure if I would use the term \"right\" but the market is definitely efficient.  As someone who knows a lot about biochem and physiology, the market is exponentially more efficient than the body.   But to (again) drastically oversimplify, with options you are somewhat \"playing the market\" but you are mainly betting against other people.  Because remember that options are by definition a derivative of the market.  To buy any option there has to be a seller.  To sell any option there has to be a buyer.  How much is an option worth?  Whatever someone is willing to pay for it.  I may actually address this in a video today because several people have asked about it.  Anyways...\n\nI mentioned in the video that I intentionally didn't show graphs and data because as a nerdy PhD scientist I know I can sometimes overwhelm people with data.  However, if you are interested I can share some graphs/data.  To answer some of your questions (and this might actually be easier in video form....especially now that I know how to actually stream ha).\n\nLet me break your questions/comments into sections:\n\n\"IV generally goes down after earnings calls. There should be a way to exploit this\"  (I realize there is an \"unless\" after this, i'll get to that next).\n\nThis is the basic strategy of the majority of my trades and many others who consistently make money (and if you learn via Tasty Trade it's their central philosophy).  Most people making money don't advertise or explain how to \"exploit\" this (for reasons I'll mention below).  Remember that the basic rule for any options trade is \"buy in low IV and sell high IV\".  For the sake of making a point lets just say that IV always goes down after earnings.  If you know that you should sell in high IV and buy in low IV, then you would do just that.  You would sell an option(s) in high IV before earnings and buy it back (ie. buy to close) after earnings.  If you look at the trades I posted that is what I did in all the earnings trades (although some using a slightly more complicated approach.\n\n\"...unless the market already priced in that tendency. My hypothesis would be that if you graphed the current prices of the same option, purchased right now, over the series of available expiration dates you might choose, you would see a kink in the curve at the earnings call date.\"\nRemember \"the market\" (stock market) is somewhat separate from the options market.  And the true answer to this complicated because there are many different options prices you could graph (ie. there are different strike prices).  But here is a simplified answer explanation.  As you likely know when there is an earnings announcement many times stocks will move significantly following the announcement.  Beat expectations stock usually goes up, earnings below expectation stock goes down.  However, the price almost never goes to zero and no stock has ever gone to infinity.  Thus, there is a range.  Here is where there \"market uncertainty\".  Analysts and others try and predict earnings how much a stock will move, but it's impossible to predict reliably and accurately.  \n\nSo what happens to options prices after an earnings call?  First a r/wallstreetbets type example.  For the sake of making a point lets say company ABCD is trading at 100 per share stock price and has earning announcement tomorrow.  You buy a call option with a strike price of 150 for $10 that expires in 18 days (although any DTE 50 day or less would work in this example).  Lets say that company goes to 170 after earnings.  That call option is 'in the money\" and definitely going to be worth more.  You might be able to sell it for $1000.   And you think, man that was easy.  I risked $10 to make $1,000.  Next time I'm going to buy 100 calls!   ...That is essentially the YOLOs at r/wallstreetbets.  \n\nBut how often does a stock change 70% and the direction (ie up or down) that you picked.    Thus, this type of thing does not happen very often.\n\nMore realistically, lets say the company went to 110 after earnings.  What happens to the price of your call option?  It may possibly go up a little the day after earnings (if people think the stock could keep going up to 150), but more than likely it goes down.  Then a week from now lets say the stock is still around 110.  Your call option is now worth exponentially less.  Time is against you.  For that option to be \"in the money\" the stock needs to be at 150 (really over 150) and now there are less days for that to happen.\n\nThird example. Lets say you bought a put with a strike of 90 and 18 DTE.  That put is worth substantially less after earnings. \n\nTo get back to your question and over simplistic, if you graph the price/value of options that are not in the money before earnings but move into the money after earnings the price goes up.   If you graph options that are not out of the money before earnings and stay out of the  money the price/value of the options goes down.\n\nSo how do you exploit this?  I sell outside the money options and hope the stock doesn't move to a point that puts them in the money.  You can actually roughly estimate how far a stock will move after earnings based on volatility.  However I usually go with strikes prices that are relatively far outside the money to be safe.\n\nLets go back to the r/wallstreetsbet example.  Yesterday people there were buying tons of options on AMD way outside the money, with the basic mindset \"i can risk a $1000 to potentially make $10,000 or even $50,000 overnight\".  AMD announced earnings and it looks like the stock is going to move about from about 55 to 53.  Assuming the stock stays around 53 today, every call option bought yesterday are worth less (and most worth nothing or close to nothing), and every put with a strike below 53 is worth less (strike of 52 might be up a little briefly).  Thus, really the only AMD options bought yesterday that are worth more today are the puts with a 55 or 54 strike price.\n\nSo who made money here?  How would skilled options traders make money when a stock only moves 2% after earnings?  Skilled traders are the ones selling them the options.  Skilled traders are the ones (almost literally) selling lottery tickets.  If someone wanted to pay me for 1000 AMD calls with a strike price of 100 yesterday or a put with a strike of 25, I would gladly sell them.\n\nConclusion: If you are a trader and making consistent trades would you rather make trades that:\nA) Can turn a little money into a lot of money fast, but only 0.1% of the time \nor\nB) Make a little money, but do it on 95% of all trades.\n\nSmall trades add up.

There's a lot for me to absorb in here, so I've been doing some homework before responding.\n\nI've never seen a comparison of the efficiency of the market vs. the human body!  Interesting.  Also as far data and graphs, I would think reddit would be amenable to them in general.  And despite my ignorance of the subject, I suspect people who are not ready to look at a well-presented and relevant graph or dataset are not ready to trade profitably.  In any case, I would like to see them.\n\nEarlier in the discussion of market efficiency, you make a distinction between equities and options.  I recognize that the latter is more close to being purely a bettor's game, but it is nonetheless a market.  Why would options markets tend to be any less efficient than equities?  My initial thought is that the relatively high volume of \"betting\" happening in options markets should make it even more efficient than equities, but I'm not sure.\n\n> If someone wanted to pay me for 1000 AMD calls with a strike price of 100 yesterday or a put with a strike of 25, I would gladly sell them.\n\nWhile I'm unsure if I understood everything above, I think this is one of the central points you've been making.  My question, though: At what price?  In the extreme, are you prepared to sell me those options for a penny?\n\nI do see that your approach will produce wins a large majority of the time, say 95% of the time.  I'm not bothered that on average, those wins will generally be small on a given trade, but it looks like a key piece of information is missing here: How much larger is the average loss that happens the other 5% of the time?  Simply, if the average loss is 19x as big as the average win, it will not be profitable.  Taking the 95% win rate as a given, my first thought was that if the option is priced efficiently, that ratio will be *exactly* 19:1.  But this is too simplistic, even ignoring commission costs.  In an efficiently priced options market, I'm thinking that ratio *should* tilt slightly in favor of the seller, because the seller is taking on more risk.  No chance the buyer of an option ever gets hit with a black swan.  So as you say, there should be an inherent -- and ongoing -- profit opportunity in selling options, because an option seller is a risk buyer.\n\nBut is there an ongoing opportunity for *outsize* returns relative to that risk?  I'm still not seeing why that should be the case here.  I've read through your examples several times now and I think I understand them, and I get the point about volatility dropping after the earnings release, but I'm not seeing an argument as to how the prices regularly become unhinged from Black-Scholes in the weeks before the earning release so I'm not clear how there's alpha to be had here.  Buy options when IV is high before the earnings come out, and sell them afterward when it tends to be lower... that makes sense all else equal.  But is all else equal?  Or does the market price of the options tend to be slightly higher in the lead up toward earnings and slightly lower after they are released?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "\"While I'm unsure if I understood everything above, I think this is one of the central points you've been making.

And there is always the black swan.  If you want zero risk, options is not for you (and the stock market as well).\nRelated to risk: Being a scientist that has screwed up many experiments, I also have a \"worst case scenario\" and also a plan B and plan C if things go wrong.    Today at 3 i'll go over a trade i'm (likely) going to make that some may call very high risk for little potential return, but I'll explain all the details.\n\nYou are 100% correct that options are a market.

By focusing on selling puts, you are effectively in the business of selling insurance (There’s also a VRP associated w/ selling calls, it’s more like selling a lottery ticket as you said above; I think it’s not quite as strong in general and I think you’ve mentioned that once or twice.  But anyway I think you sell more puts than calls and I’m focusing on learning about the same approach for now).\n\nOne of the reasons money can be made selling puts is because there is consumer demand for downside protection.  They will give up some expected return in order to be protected.  (I guess the corrollary is that money can made selling calls because there is consumer demand for YOLOs).  So that’s the foundation for why option selling ought to be profitable as an industry.\n\nThe next broad component of your approach that I’m seeing appears to be risk management.  Iron Condors, etc.  To the extent that these require *buying* options, they actually involve giving up a sliver of profits.  However, in tandem with the primary thrust of your approach — capturing the VRP as effectively as possible — that sliver is worth the cost because it allows you to deploy your capital so much more effectively.\n\nCapturing the VRP and using a variety of strategies to manage risk look to me to be the primary and secondary pieces of your approach, respectively.  From there, a tertiary piece seems to revolve around volatility changes after earnings release.  I’m guessing as I dig more, I will find scholarly literature describing an “earnings release volatility risk premium” that matches with this.  So you capture both the baseline, generic VRP and this additional more specific VRP.  It sounds like this is quite strong in itself.  How much of the value of this trade would you say comes from the baseline part compared to the earnings call part?\n\nContinuing my summary of what I’ve learned from you: Another key move it looks like you incorporate I think is called “The Wheel:” You sell a put that, if assigned to you, would get you a share of a stock you’d like to own long term, at a price you’d be happy to buy it at.

Am I right that this part, while enhancing your returns for sure, is more of an “icing on the cake?”  Whereas the other components drive most of how this works?\n\nOk I know you’ve thrown out quite a bit more than that, I mainly wanted to see if I’m getting the basics right.  Assuming I am, this is pretty exciting!  But it also leads me to a new question: While I see why the VRP should create an opportunity to make money selling options, I haven’t figured out the reason why a home-based options seller should (or should not) be able to get in on a piece of it.  Like, there are lots of industries out there where it makes sense that somebody somewhere could make a profit in them, but that doesn’t mean we can all do so from our laptops in our pajamas.  So for the VRP, why wouldn’t it be the case that hedge funds  and other pros would just get all the gravy?  They can get stuff like volume trading discounts, and they can negotiate for a favorable position in the order flow, and they have a ton of capital so they can use high volume and throughput to let them trade on thin margins... and I’m sure they have other tricks up their sleeves, too.  And, the trades you’ve demonstrated could presumably be executed algorithmically, quicker and in a more optimal way.  What stops professional capital from flowing over to this and capture the premia and leave nothing for us?", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "I have a simple off topic question. I'm kinda new to trading in general. And especially to options. So, I hope that you can help me out. If you have calls that are far out of the money, like Apple is currently trading at $286.91, and I would short a call option with strike price $320, and an expiration date of May 1. I don't expect Apple to increase 11.5% in the following 2 days. What could go wrong here if I hold this till the expiration date? What am I missing here?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "If I understand correctly you are asking about selling at 320 strike call option in AAPL with an expiration date of May 1, correct?  \n\nIt sounds like you are neutral to slighly bullish in AAPL, like you think AAPL may go up a little but not up 11% in two days.  With that in mind a couple things:\n\nSelling an option always has inherit risk.  Even if the option is not \"in the money\" you can still get assigned stock (ie. early assignment).  It's not common, but is more common with options with close expiration dates (like May 1).  Especially when a company is near a binary event (earnings, dividend, etc.), and I believe AAPL is announcing earnings on tomorrow.  That is one of the primary reason when I sell options (calls or puts) with at least 14 days to expiration and usually closer to 21.  \n\nThen there is the obvious risk that AAPL does actually move 11%...or even more.  Theoretically there is unlimited loss potential.  Just look at TSLA at the end of January and early February.   And if it does and you only have a day or so to expiration you are pretty much guaranteed to lose a good amount of money.  With a farther out expiration date you can make adjustments.\n\nSelling a put outside the money would be the better strategy if I understand your thoughts correctly on APPL.  If you sell a put outside of the money AAPL can go up, stay the same, or even go down slightly and you will likely make money.\n\nHOWEVER, i never recommend new people trade naked options (ie. just sell a call or a put), because as I mentioned there is theoretically unlimited loss potential and you don't know how to manage a trade that goes massively against you.  I highly recommend \"defined risk trades\" for new people.  Thus, if you wanted to sell a call (ie. short call) you would also buy a call that is even further out of the money.  This is the safer (ie. less risky trade) as it creates what is called a spread.  \n\nI will probably make a trade in AAPL this week.  I also don't think it's going to go up 11% (or down 11%).  \n\nI will probably:\nSell May 15, 255 strike put \nSell May 15, 320 strike call\n\nI'm essentially hoping that AAPL stays between 240 and 320 and that vol decreases post earnings.\n\nThe defined risk version of this trade would be \nBuy May 15, 240 strike put.\nSell May 15, 255 strike put \nSell May 15, 320 strike call\nBuy May 15, 340 strike put", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for the comprehensive explanation.

It really means a lot to people like me who are just getting started.\n\n I'm fairly new to this, so forgive me if what I'm trying to ask is confusing. My question was trying to get at how it's possible to even make money trading options, from a theoretical standpoint.\n\nMy understanding is that options essentially price risk vs return. So even if a trade, let’s say a credit spread, has a higher probability of profit because it is more out of the money, then you will receive a lower premium on it. I remember reading about this here ([https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/90cjc0/expected\\_value\\_and\\_high\\_vs\\_low\\_probability\\_trades/](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/90cjc0/expected_value_and_high_vs_low_probability_trades/)), and from my basic probability knowledge, that this will come out to an expected value of zero for any options trade. So if I was to run thousands of trades, I would net zero.\n\nIn this sense, my understanding is that in order to actually make money you need to have some sort of edge. For a large hedge fund, this can be getting better prices/premiums than a retail investor would. What I'm trying to understand is what that competitive edge is for you that ensures you make money/are profitable on a trade like your iron condor on Shopify. Because, if my understanding is correct, then even though that trade has a really low likelihood of crossing your put/call strike prices, the profitability potential accounts for that. So even if you made a little bit each time on Shopify from 100 trades like that, if one of those trades went against you, that could wipe out the profits from the other 99 trades. What I'm trying to understand is what you’re evaluating/considering before making this trade so it doesn’t end up losing you money and come out profitable.\n\nSorry that this is really long.

The atmosphere could be blow off, and these pricks would have domes allowing them to survive at something at least as good as a 1960s American standard of living while the people outside died gasping. Ya know, basically the pre-rona divide, just with 99% less atmosphere.\n\n**Market #2: Companies that might not be well capitalized, but their particular business model is got-dammed perfect for the apocalypse.**\n\n* 98% of pharma\n* Every tanker company not run by some crooked Greek dood\n* REITs that bothered to establish criteria for their tenants\n* Your mom's favorite john -- the kinda guy who always fuckin earns because he has a kid's college fund to pay and a wife and a whore he pretends is his side chick\n\nThese motherfuckers breathe sulphur. They can biochemically synthesize it by sucking on the rocks left behind on our lifeless planet.\n\nThe apocalypse is their time to shine.\n\n**Market #3: The truly and rightly fucked.** Poorly capitalized, highly leveraged companies that have no way to make a buck right now.\n\nJPM is gonna pistol whip them, take whatever shit they have in their pockets, and leave them for dead. Maybe they live? Maybe we care? Probably not on both counts.\n\n* 99.44% of oil exploration\n* Brick-and-mortar retailers like JCP that leave you asking, \"Wait? Shouldn't they have died during Dot-Com, 9-11, Lehman Brothers, or the Omicronian Invasion? WTF?\"\n* REITs that bought your house and are now your landlord\n* That broke ass john your mom's pimp had to fuck up so he'd go away and stop stalking her and saying he was gonna wife that bitch up\n\nA lot of folks think the entire economy is comprised of the sad fucks in market #3. It is not.\n\nThis is where the confusion comes from. Market #3 is going to burn to the fucking ground. It might be 66% of the economy, but it's not even 33% of the larger market.\n\nThe lucky ducks will make it out of the fire and get eaten up in M&A. For example, the oil stonks will buy up smaller companies and acquire shit in bankruptcy, re-emerging as Highlander-style gods sometime between 2023 and 2025.\n\nThe unlucky will die.\n\nThe mutant fucking retards will survive. For example, JCP will survive by virtue of bankruptcy restructuring and make it past 2030.\n\nIn other words, America as usually. Yeah, her makeup got fucked up, and now you realize her skin was fucked up by injecting UV and Clorox. But she'll clean that shit up and take her ass right back out to the parking lot at the truck stop because she's gotta earn.\n\nWe still have two out of three markets, and that ain't bad.\n\nYa dig?
