Those options are all call skew for the most part, maybe some delta when it skyrockets up.\n\n99.99% of people who trade those calls are just -EV gambling...but with high variance so they can hit it big.

Knowledge is key and well, I’ll learn from this 100%.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Yea so this is how this option works.  You are essentially betting on a huge asymmetric move to the upside (which I think you knew, so that's good).  It's a heavy risk-reward option.  When I say asymmetric move, I mean like a 10%+ jump move immediately, not some slow 3% move over the course of a day.  Even a 10% instant move is way better than a slow 10% move in 1 day, even though just delta wise they have almost the same impact (this shows you how skew plays a role over delta).  This means if you hit, it's gonna be huge.  But on average it's -EV.\n\nLet's try a good example.  So imagine playing craps.  It's like an \"All Tall\" bet.  It's pretty -EV, but if it hits, it's a big reward.\n\nNow here's the thing.  It's not exacty like craps because in craps, you can't really have data that then helps you make a better \"roll of the dice.\"  In options, there are actually some situations where this bet, although -EV on average, turns into a +EV bet.  It would have in late January actually.  So you have to try to see when this type of bet can turn +EV, and although win % is still small, when you do win, you win so much your EV is positive.\n\ntldr; you trade this option for an asymmetric up move...you never trade this option to realize ITM.  Btw, you aren't exactly done with this option.  Just pray Tesla jumps lke 10% immediately at the open tomorrow.  your option might not be dead.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "This is gold. I understand now. So it would’ve been a lot smarter of me to look at the markets and go more ITM than OTM and further out for a more likelihood of having +EV, btw EV referring to enterprise value correct?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "EV is expected value.\n\nHowever, the answer to that question is super complicated.  Here's the simple way to think about it.  An ATM option in Tesla costs more.  Sure, it has a better chance to be ITM, but if it doesn't become ITM, you lose a LOT more on this ATM option than your way OTM option. So that doesn't mean one option is necessarily better than another option.  \n\nHere's the better way to think about it.\n\nWhat is your objective in Tesla?  What are you looking for?\n\n1.  Are you looking for a 25% single day move (so Tesla goes from like 730 end of today to just below 1000 end of day tomorrow)?  In that case, the 1000 OTM calls > 750 ATM calls in terms of just % change, assuming you sell EOD tomorrow after this move.  % change is important here, obviously if you just buy 1 of each call, the 750 is better in total return (that's easy to understand right?), but I am going to assume you bought an equal amount notional of each call, in which case the 1000 call percent change is better.\n\n2.  Are you looking for a 10% immediate jump of Tesla at the open?  In that case, the 1000 OTM calls > 750 ATM calls, assuming you sell immediately after the 10% jump move at the open.  This is because your % return (or EV) is higher for the 1000 OTM calls at the time of the sale, even though they won't even be ITM.\n\n3.  Are you just looking for a 10% slow 1 day move of Tesla.  10% move is a HUGE move, but actually in that case the 750 ATM call > 1000 OTM call.  Your 750 ATM call will gain value, but your 1000 OTM call will actually lose value EVEN IF Tesla went up 10% tomorrow to 800. \n\nSo consider your risk-reward.  I am definitely not saying the OTM call is worse than the ATM call.  It depends on the payoff and what you are looking for.  In many cases, the OTM call > ATM call if you factor in notional amount, in addition to % change.  For example, if Tesla goes down like 5% the next two days, your OTM call in notional amount would actually be better if you consider the amount you can lose for the ATM call.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Very informative man.

I began to look for value to see what Airliners will have the easiest time surviving this pandemic, and have less stress on their balance sheet compared to their peers.\n\nGeneral Comps models (Small cap, Mid cap Airliners)\n\nSmall cap\n\nhttps://imgur.com/taiSCyP\n\nMid cap\n\nhttps://imgur.com/WzkaXk2\n\nBalance sheet metrics\n\nI chose two Airliners from each comparable model that I thought were the most undervalued compared to their peers. I then compared data revolving around their debt and short-term obligations. The ratios I thought would most accurately reflect balance sheet health were Total debt/capital, Debt/equity, Current ratio and Interest coverage ratio. \n\nSmall cap (The two that stood out were $ALK and $JBLU) \n\nhttps://imgur.com/1xmUUzR\n\n\nMid cap (The two that stood out were $DAL and $LUV)\n\nhttps://imgur.com/fWdY2WI\n\n\nDCF (Discounted cash-flow valuation)\n\nAfter finding Airliners that I believed were undervalued, and had healthy balance sheets compared to their industry peers I decided to run a DCF on each individual company to determine their fair value (And potential upside).\n\nSmall Cap Airliners:\n\n$ALK (Alaska Airlines) 5-yr EBITDA exit\n\nhttps://imgur.com/phBrtRl\n\nProjected upside (Base case): 78.49%\n\nThe image above shows the Implied share values being derived based on my assumptions. This is a working model, and I am constantly assessing my EBITDA assumptions. Once $ALK releases more financial data that incorporates the impact from the crisis I will most likely need to reassess my model. (If you are interested in the rest of my model feel free to PM me) \n\nAlso $ALK is heavily reliant on their domestic flights, which will most likely recover at a faster rate than international flights once the COVID-19 (China virus) panic calms down.\n\nThe discount rates I selected are:\nLow: 8%\nMid: 7.5%\nHigh: 7%\n\n$JBLU (Jetblue Airlines) 5-yr EBITDA exit\n\nhttps://imgur.com/x4GludD\n\nProjected upside (Base case): 112.95%\n\nThe image above shows the Implied share values being derived based on my assumptions.

(If you are interested in the rest of my model feel free to PM me)\n\nDiscount rates I selected are:\nLow: 7.5%\nMid: 7%\nHigh: 6.5%\n\nBased on the research above I have started incrementally buying into $ALK, $JBLU, $LUV and $DAL. I personally think that Airliners are poised for the largest upside gain once we get out of this glut. I personally think that oil will remain at depressed levels for years to come considering that there seems to be an ongoing price war between the Saudi’s and the Russians. As well as supply reserves being maxed out around the world. Depressed oil prices will only add to the potential upside Airliners can see in the next couple years due to being able to improve their net profit margin.   \n\nI don’t think the bottom is in yet for the S&P 500, and if I had to guess it would be sometime during or after Q2 when we see the bottom in. At the end of the day no one can predict the bottom perfectly. I have decided that the best way to play this market is to buy into good names in incremental steps. But what do I know?
