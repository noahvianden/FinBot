{"title": "Does anyone here do nothing except sell covered calls and roll up infinitely when needed with a valuable stock?", "selftext": "Granted, the initial investment to do something like sell covered calls with a stock like Apple, for example, would be expensive.  However, if you can get over that, Apple has weekly options chains for which you can sell a single call option contract for $100-200, possibly even more.  If the options expire OTM, obviously you're making $200 per week, which over a month equates to $800. Over a year it might be upwards of close to $10,000 in returns doing nothing except selling weekly calls.  It's not that easy of course, because you may have to adjust positions if the SP moves against you and you'd have to roll up to a higher strike price meaning you'll lose some return, but in theory you can just keep rolling up when needed and never have to take an assignment on your shares so that you can keep collecting premiums ad infinitum. \n\nJust curious if anyone has done this type of strategy with focus on a slower, far less risky strategy on making money. You could also keep re-investing what you make on premiums to own more shares so that after a while you could sell 2 covered call contracts at once. Then you'd start to be able to exponentially grow.  Is it worth the effort to do this?  Downsides?  Am I being naive here? \n\nA lot less sexier of course than those higher risk plays that have very quick massive returns, but there is a lot less risk as far as I understand.", "id": "g9pxos", "created_utc": 1588089888.0, "score": 79, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 118, "comments": [{"body": "That’s what I’m doing with TSLA.
