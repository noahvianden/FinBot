You would be a epic fool not to.\n\nWhat you are doing is gambling that the nasdaq will beat 10% coming off a speculative bubble. I hope you agree that this is very risky. Recall the last time we had a startup based speculative bubble (.com) the nasdaq performed horribly bad. It took 15 years to get back to the peak it reached in 2000 ($109). It took 12 years to break the $60 mark...\n\nFurther if you look at the QQQ list, its not that far fetched to see things slowing. Apple is somewhat dependent on discretionary spending. MSFT cloud seems to already be slowing and they struggle to pull in newer companies. Nvidia understated its dependence on crypto. Tesla is insanely risky. FB has almost nothing up it sleeve for a long time. And so on and so forth.\n\nIf you have $10k, take the ibond.

In fact its usually discounted. Also note the author of this thread wants a 1 year hold. He will need the money for college expenses from the sound of it.\n\nIn regards to QQQ companies. Im not saying they will go out of business, what im saying is the fundamentals seem to point to less growth. Slower growth = lower valuation. Doesnt matter how much cash you have. Further, deployment of cash is very hard to predict and the results take a long time to materialize. Right now we are seeing record buybacks again.\n\nThe other issue is current market valuations are not cheap. I like to use the S&P PE as a general valuation barometer due to long history. Its running at about 19-20 PE with earning growth slowing. Though this isnt outrageous like last year, its definitely on the high side of historic averages. Granted macro dictates that this PE should climb as a bigger % of people/money participate in the market but still, 20 is on the high side of the band. In other words, there is still a good chance for valuations to flatten or even decline market wide. Id say its 50/50 regardless of inflation.\n\nIn the end you might be right. If 50/50 is believable, its still 50/50. It can go either way. I personally think the next decade will be dominated by energy tech (batteries and renewable efficiency upgrades) and computing will be slim picking. The only computing companies I like are Amazon (they should be credited with the last 10 years of computing growth for the whole sector), TSM, ASML, & QCOM because we will need an absurd amount of cheap chips and communication chips for cars and energy related devices.
