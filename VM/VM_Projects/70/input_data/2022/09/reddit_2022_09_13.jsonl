Increasing interest rate will lower economic growth and at this rate it would highly likely put us in a recession, which will tank stock prices, therefore, people wanted to sell now so they don't loose money (in your terminology you can say those people ( smart money) are paper handed and won't hodl). \n\nI hope for the sake of god this description made sense to you and see how things are going instead of the meme stocks gambling victimized mentality", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Nah bro...
