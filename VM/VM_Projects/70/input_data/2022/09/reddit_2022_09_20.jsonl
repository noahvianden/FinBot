{"title": "9-20-22 SPY/ ES Futures and Apple Daily Market Anaylsis", "selftext": "It was the eve of FOMC and all through the markets the chop was playing out. Probability of a choppy range day was there but I did not really expect that red of a pre market. Overall I think we saw some risk come off the market today.\n\nBefore people ask‚Ä¶. FOMC is tomorrow‚Ä¶ rate hike drop at 2pm and we are expecting a 75bps hike‚Ä¶ presser starts at 230pm‚Ä¶\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cfynahorr2p91.png?width=616&format=png&auto=webp&s=46b218c55ffc32681bcf467c4281e07187b430a4\n\nAs you can see we are holding sentiment at a 17% chance of 100bps and a 83% chance of 75bps‚Ä¶ there isn‚Äôt even any chance we see a 50bps hike tomorrow which is interesting.\n\nNote- TA will be brief as much like CPI‚Ä¶ FOMC will unnaturally move the market and we will have to evaluate EOD tomorrow.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a7do287sr2p91.png?width=570&format=png&auto=webp&s=2150669caa245c997d3552e31412510b38b11eff\n\nA little fun facts for you guys.. of the last four FOMCS pre market has averaged an open of 0.725% and on average FOMC closes with a green day of 2.33%+.\n\nThat means we could be expecting a pretty green pre market and from close we should look for about 392-393 close tomorrow. If we happen to get some sort of bullish hoorah from JPOW tomorrow then we could see a bigger 3-4% day. But I would be we see a 2-3% green close based on historical data.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g63uuxnsr2p91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=b3f0125fa60b9f958706320c0c1a80afbd0bfb4a\n\nLooking at SPY daily we have a dragon fly doji with a bullish engulfing daily followed by another dragonfly doji‚Ä¶ overall 382 is establishing itself as a stout support. We did breakdown and close back below that red dotted 50% channel retracement level tho.\n\nKey support- 382.2 -> 378.7 -> 375\n\nKey resistance- 385.6 -> 388.5 -> 390 -> 393.2\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2v29ws9tr2p91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=312f3005cf709aa213a99f8af69db2855ac495a5\n\nSPY weekly currently forming a gravestone doji. Key support remains at 380 and key resistance remains at 390.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pkkjz0rtr2p91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c6046d6847340b6a1c3fa3026a9fd37c4c7c00c\n\nI really would have liked to see Futures close back over 3900 today, however, it looks like it will close below 3900 and will lead to a new lower close. This is the lowest close since July 18th.\n\nKey support- 3830 -> 3762\n\nKey resistance- 3900 -> 3925 -> 3973\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mi47f19ur2p91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b02c29ce8debfde8486a6e3f5cdbe7ce793ef23\n\nFutures weekly breaking through its previous double bottom. Key support remains at 3790 and key resistance 3900 -> 4000.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/esl982sur2p91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=f80b5e432647785ee59424b5b7312ab3d6ef5d78\n\nApple is just that little stock that could‚Ä¶ closing as the lone green top 10 tech. It continued to look strong and break through a lot of pretty major resistances today. IT broke through key 154.5 resistance, daily 200ema, daily 8ema and broke its black bear channel. Apple is looking fairly strong here.\n\nKey support- 154.5 -> 152.4 -> 150.8\n\nKey resistance- 157.5 -> 160\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ou6jlsbvr2p91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=60d151712a974e74e575f95053ccc45d62eea88f\n\nApple weekly is really establishing 149 as support here. I will be looking for apple to continue to hold 155.9 and attempt to take out this bear channel resistance at 161.4 by EOW.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yo4y0kuvr2p91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=6971362d5d444919b48f79cca3aa3a9b70cb99c4\n\nVIx continues to remain pretty unphased by everything that is happening‚Ä¶ it did close back over key 26.9 resistance and once again established 25.5 as support. Tomorrow with FOMC we should expect a small push up around 28-29 but as long as JPOW sticks to the script of 75bps and doesn‚Äôt go anything wild we should see it close back near 25.5 EOD.\n\n10% challenge-\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4n2ob4bwr2p91.png?width=763&format=png&auto=webp&s=98d07eae4e8ba6cda099c20f7d8077d89048c668\n\nPretty great day overall. Had a bit of struggle this morning that‚Äôs for sure catching some bad bounces on those Puts. Technicals for me at least were a bit of as struggle today. We say VOLD trending in extreme bear momentum almost all day and pretty much sell off all day long. We never really saw green buying momentum to represent the bounces we were seeing. Not only that but with apple at times up 2% and spy down 1% there was a lot of divergence in the markets and the VIX was disconnected (as I mentioned most likely would be). Definitely was a struggle trading today. But came out on top.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sd3koqswr2p91.png?width=814&format=png&auto=webp&s=c961a0a2ba9ce2115b0350a9bd3a0523e44cdeb4\n\nBased on probabilities of a green open on FOMC I decided to open this call. I wasn‚Äôt going to swing calls but this play is about 10% of my normal position size so even if we go to zero its like taking a 15-20% stop loss on a normal sized played so I liked the risk‚Ä¶ Overall I will close this at open regardless of trend‚Ä¶ unless it opens red then I will wait until fomc presser at 230 and attempt to close it on the run up.\n\nGood luck tomorrow. Expect a lot of consolidation after an initial morning push around 1030 and possibly a retrace back to opening price before 2pm. There will be a decent IV pump tomorrow (also why I got calls) that you can play too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nyoutube will be up later", "id": "xjjxiu", "created_utc": 1663706446.0, "score": 91, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 75, "comments": [{"body": "Thank you for your continued TA!
