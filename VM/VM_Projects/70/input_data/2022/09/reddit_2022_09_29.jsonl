While their products are not as sexy as they once were in terms of DAU and traffic growth they're still as popular than ever.\n\nThere are certainly questions about their long-term growth trajectory, but at the current valuation they're not priced for growth anyway. And even if you assume DAUs drop a bit over the next several years digital advertising is still a growing industry which should help provide a floor to any revenue declines.\n\nI was also very sceptical of the metaverse to begin with but I've started to become more of a believer in Zucks vision as of late. I was trying out their Horizon Worlds game recently and I was quite surprised by how immersive the experience was. After a few minutes it really felt like I was hanging out with people in the real world. As the technology continues to improves I can see it taking off even if it always remains a niche compared to video and messaging apps.\n\nFinally I think people just generally underestimate Zuck as an entrepreneur. Everyone likes to mock him because he's a bit odd, but I think that works in his favour because he seems to think differently than the other big tech CEOs. GOOG, MSFT and AMZN really like to chase each other for example. If one of those companies enters a space the other two will follow. AAPL is a bit of an exception, they don't follow. They know what they're good at and they stick to that and execute perfectly. I'd argue META is similar. Zuck really knows what they're good at - Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, Oculus - these are all great social products that have practically no competition from the other big tech players. He could be trying to start a cloud company and working on driverless vehicles, but he doesn't.
