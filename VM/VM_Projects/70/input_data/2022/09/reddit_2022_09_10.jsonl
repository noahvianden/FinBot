To get a bank loan with decent interest rates I need to bring in alot of my own money. That is why I want to sell atleast a quarter or even half of my stocks. My depot consists of several Etf's and maybe two dozen single stocks. Some of my stocks did really well (like 80% - 150% gains) and some of my stocks did poorly (like 5% - 30% losses). I try to buy only \"good\" companies, so the reason for most of my stocks that did poorly are because I bought them at a bad timing (like at the ATH right before the current bear market). So I expect most of them to eventually get back up in the long run. Admittedly some stocks are just high risk, for example hydrogen companies like Plug Power. I dont know if they will ever rise again to their previous ATH or die out. \n\nSo as of right know I am unsure whether I should sell the stocks that are currently at a profit or the one that are currently at a loss.  At the one hand I dont wanna lock in my losses with stocks that I expect to get back up again. On the other side my profitable stocks will hopefully also keep rising and I dont want to keep only \"losing\" stocks in my depot.

Until that happens though, [SPY ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/AMEX-SPY/)to 440 before I see any good positions for shorts. Crashes happen fast though who knows on a 6-12 month outlook, but were already down 25% NDX, historically crashes can hit 50% drawdown on NDX easy, but the snapback is always very quick within 1-2 months of the bottom, cant really time these things. I'm only looking for a 1:8 put to hedge the port at the right price, maybe if this trendline doesn't get blasted.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j0if4prsm2n91.png?width=1789&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfc4a1e348a92c1d83a03f4e18c7db41b4d0d4b5", "id": "xavv53", "created_utc": 1662833178.0, "score": 16, "upvote_ratio": 0.71, "num_comments": 72, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | |[DGEN\\FRENDS](https://twitter.com/dgenfrends)|\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|just now\n**Total Comments**|0|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=xavv53)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=xavv53)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Lol draw random lines and hope for the best.
