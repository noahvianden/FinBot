However, the bears once again took control today. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9lnd67mqwam91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=0326a22e9e8cba3398838df587977958f1f5bb55\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7zjhutbrwam91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=b579d6bba7fdf5b988937098cc0c69ee770ac576\n\nToday we finally saw the 13 week long recovery support line from the June low/ v-bottom break on SPY. This is the same trend line we saw break last Friday on Apple. \n\nWith this trend line broken AND bears finally closing a candle below 391 support and also breaking down to 388.42 intraday today I am officially bearish. I am also bearish due to CPI and FOMC that are coming up soon. Lets talk chart technical and then end of this I will tell you why I am bearish fomc/ cpi and what position I am in because of it. \n\nSPY daily has a nice falling wedge forming right now (black solid lines) this falling wedge gives us a support tomorrow at 387.8 and a resistance of 394.1 (todays HOD). There are fairly high odds that we will see this falling wedges support broken later this week. \n\nKey resistance now will remain at 391 tomorrow as that is the major daily resistance level that we have to watch and that took 3 trading days to finally close below. \n\nWe are still trading within that red bear channel which gives support tomorrow at 382 (-2.2% from close) and gives resistance of 401.1 (+2.6%). Until we see the red bear channel resistance line broken I would hesitate to go long here on calls especially since we broke into the 380s today. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1mmct0yrwam91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=195cc8322cde079120a0bd5769f9bd5fe0b6218c\n\nSpy weekly we did perfectly hold support on that 13 week long weekly bull support line, however, in later you see that Apple and Futures both broke this support so SPY should be to follow next. I mentioned that we should play level to level on SPY now. With the 390 level being breached and the 380s being seen for the first time since middle of July we now are set up in the current trajectory to see 360s-370s by end of September. \n\nKey support is now 390.3 on the weekly chart from there the next major support is 367.1 which is the weekly 200ema. The weekly 200ema is where we bounce aggressively off in June. \n\nKey resistance will be at 396.5 for this week followed by 402.2. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3gdpc7jswam91.png?width=756&format=png&auto=webp&s=0151ca831620d5e19da8910bd7671d04c862fa0b\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xltmuq0twam91.png?width=764&format=png&auto=webp&s=0478aaecff12d5235ed5780b50d33b56e3867f65\n\nSimilar story as you may expect with futures. We broke under 3900 today for the first time since July 19th. However, as of now the bears were unable to close under key support of 3900. We did see a break down of the 13 week long v-bottom bull support line today also. This should lead to a bearish movement going forward. \n\nKey supports to watch is 3900 -> 3883 (the black solid falling wedge) -> 3865 -> 3816.\n\nKey resistance to watch is 3925 -> 3944 (black falling wedge resistance) -> 4025.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yry55rktwam91.png?width=736&format=png&auto=webp&s=234a6c74d1c9e698db1b8097c81630095d430732\n\nHere is that weekly futures support line breakdown I was speaking about above. With this line being broken that is incredibly bearish longer term. With this support line being broken this gives rise to test support at 3827 and 3676 (weekly 200ema). I will be watching for futures to finally close under 3900 this week and that will be the longer term signal that 3600s are coming again. \n\nKey resistance remains at 4000 this week. Until this week breaks 4000 I will remain bearish. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zgqnj98uwam91.png?width=848&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a63a90fe98b5028461427acf0a7a283585ee0fa\n\nApple actually had a fairly bearish day today now only short term but long term. With a close below the daily 200ema for the first time since July this should be a very bearish omen for the future.\n\nKey support remains at 153.2 (falling wedge black solid lines) and then 150 (-3%) for the red bear channel support. \n\nKey resistance is 156 (black falling wedge resistance line) and then 160.3 (+3.6%) for the red bear channel resistance. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q68zdctuwam91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=d7aadcbd5112f0cf39209cc80d99a01584276e45\n\nThe Apple charts weekly is actually kinda crazy to look at. When you think about the fact that Apple really has survived the best of all the stocks out there (for the most part) its natural that it has the most downside to expect too. The weekly is in a clear downward cycle that looks just like March. With this current downward channel I can expect a possibility that Apple COULD reach 120s by October on the current trajectory. \n\nWith the weekly 13 week long bull support line being broken I fully anticipate further downside on Apple the rest of the week and month. \n\nKey levels\n\n150.3 -> 145.7 -> 141.9 (weekly 100ema) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iwr87bdvwam91.png?width=759&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ac7cd683b11458f7b269712835512cdb99c4dc7\n\nThe VIX continues to find support and continues to make new highs. Today we actually made a new recent high again. We backtested the 8ema support and also 25.5 support and held that. We also managed to close over key 26.8 resistance from last week. The VIX appears to be on a trajectory for 30+ which makes a lot of sense when you factor in CPI next Tuesday the 13th and FOMC in 15 days on the 21st. \n\nSpeaking of CPI and FOMC‚Ä¶ let me tell you how I am positioned and how I am playing this. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zcjyz82wwam91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=b77648d58ea96c5c1af5bc0885afb1382e7c0588\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ss3rklmwwam91.png?width=913&format=png&auto=webp&s=33ebb54b816604a309c1187db84a8fd98902137a\n\nI alerted this today and here is why. This is the week before CPI and historically (you guys know I love my historic trends) there is usually a 2 days sell off prior to CPI. In the past 5 CPIs we are actually averaging a total drop of about 2.5% over the two days leading up to CPI. In addition the week before CPI (which is also next week) is averaging a intraweek drop of -2.86% through the week with two of those having a 5%+ drop. If you don‚Äôt factor in the last FOMC (the only time we were green the week before FOMC) then we are actually averaging a -4.23% drop the week prior to FOMC. \n\nWith this info you can see how it‚Äôs a pretty good odds that we are going to see a sell off EOW here and next week should be red due to the historical trend. Now here is something even more suspicious about this CPI‚Ä¶ \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/grz1ir8xwam91.png?width=767&format=png&auto=webp&s=b5bfbfd1fe43a7d4f33266440c9b58839ce298d1\n\nHistorically the CPI forecast and consensus is released well ahead of the actual CPI reading. The last CPI I know they released CPI about 2-3 week before the physical CPI reading happened. I know in the last there were times it was released just shortly after the previous CPI also. The fact that there is no release of this CPI, the president says inflation hasn‚Äôt peaked, technically month over month CPI was 0% so it too didn‚Äôt drop just didn‚Äôt go up, all the fed members screaming inflations not peaked, and daddy JPOW himself at the Jackson hole saying inflation hasn‚Äôt peaked and rate hikes haven‚Äôt stopped‚Ä¶ I have a feeling this consensus/ forecast has purposefully not been released yet. I think when they release it the number is going to be way higher then the previous 8.5% and when that happens markets are going to panic and we are going to see a very similar June 8th to June 13th CPI drop of 10% in 5 days. \n\nI personally believe we are seeing the bear storm forming and the eye of the hurricane is here right now. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0u9rbloxwam91.png?width=956&format=png&auto=webp&s=a397c362a7209e670933ad81973cf1a950eaec22\n\nI opened this put today. I will hold this put until we break the red resistance of this bear market. If we test and reject the red resistance line I will average this put down. Otherwise I will let this one ride. \n\nI tactfully chose September 21st expiration as that is the FOMC meeting and my goal would be to close this either the Friday before FOMC or the day before FOMC depending on how markets have behaved and reacted to CPI. Another potential take profits are will be 370 as that will be a major support line too. \n\n10% challenge-\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lql1vj6ywam91.png?width=780&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd2c6e9e945dc36b5c5b0d10b1c7eac4713cd450\n\nAfter last weeks frustration I decided to go down to about a $1000/ position with a -20% stop loss and a 20% take profit set on all orders. I also watch the stochs and whenever I see the stochs hit overbought (if im in call) or over sold (if in puts) on the 1min when im scalping I exit no matter where I am profit wise. \n\nToday was a much needed day for me mentally. The biggest change I made today though besides a slightly smaller position size was that I no longer hesitated in a play. I often found myself waiting and waiting and waiting for all the confirmations only to find I missed the bigger move. Today when I saw the setup and the trend aligned with my strategy I didn‚Äôt let fear stop me from entering. If it met my criteria I entered and it worked really well for me today. I truly look forward to the rest of the week trading now. \n\nYoutube be up later!", "id": "x7lgk6", "created_utc": 1662497451.0, "score": 95, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 78, "comments": [{"body": "Dude you have legitimately helped me turn my portfolio around with these posts.
