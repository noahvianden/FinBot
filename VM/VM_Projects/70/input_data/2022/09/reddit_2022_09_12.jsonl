Advantages include economies of scale, brand positioning, patents, and supply chain relationships. Another underappreciated advantage is gaining knowledge and information in the early stage before others have gotten started, which can be leveraged in later stages of the game to accumulate yet more knowledge and information in a virtuous cycle. Wright’s Law is not just an industry-wide model; it also applies to individual firms. The game is actually a race down the Wright’s law learning curve, as well as a competition over whose curve has the steepest slope—that is, who extracts the most innovation potential out of each doubling of cumulative production. This is why pace of innovation is all that matters in the long run for any market in which there is still a significant cost delta between the best producers and their less successful competitors.  \n\n\nI think for the car market, this first mover advantage is strong for engineering, including supply chain, design, manufacturing, and servicing. Tesla’s head start is a gigantic and probably insurmountable barrier to competition in many ways. Today I want to focus on how it’s given them data and experience.  \n\n\nApple and Foxconn, for instance, are formidable companies but they haven’t even started an attempt at EV mass production. New companies like Rivian and Lucid have been working longer but are much less capitalized and less known than Apple & Foxconn, and they still haven’t actually been shipping cars to customers for years. Apple coming to the car market would be like when Michael Jordan left basketball to play baseball in 1993. Despite being a world-class elite athlete at the peak of his athletic prime, he did not even make it to the Major Leagues as a baseball player. The obvious reason was that he had not practiced baseball since high school.  \n\n\nWhen engineers design a machine like a car, they have simulation models and physical test data showing that stuff should work in theory, but there's still significant uncertainty. Engineers also have models and test data for the manufacturing system and associated uncertainty. Automotive engineering has even more uncertainty than most machine designs because the duty cycle is intense, customer expectations are high, and the vehicle spends most of its time outside with all the accompanying stress from vibration, temperature, salt, moisture, even UV radiation. Plus, the expected service lifetime is more than a decade. Accelerated life testing is crucial for planning this but you just never really know until actually putting the cars in service and waiting for them to get old.  \n\n\nAny new car company has to learn all this from scratch. Sure, they can hire people who have worked in the car industry and they can do their best to copy industry best practices, and they can even buy all the latest commercial off-the-shelf software tools, but there's still a limit. Companies have institutional knowledge, policies and procedures, relationships between people, and habits that are hard to transfer over bit by bit to a new company. Tribal knowledge tends to be indigenous to the environment of the tribe. Companies also have critical data that they’re generally unwilling to share.  \n\n\nWith greater design uncertainty, engineers need to apply bigger safety margins and sometimes need to add extra layers of redundancy in case of failure. All of this comes at a price: reduced vehicle performance on key design criteria like cost, range, acceleration, handling, safety, etc. Uncertainty also brings the risk of setting margins too thin and having a higher-than-anticipated failure rate in service, like Nissan's battery degradation in the first-generation Leaf, GM's spectacular f-up with the LG pouch cell partnership and Ford's melting high-current electrical contacts. In the fog of misunderstanding, mistakes happen, especially in organizations where decisions are made based on politics, deceit and confrontation instead of logic, honesty and cooperation.  \n\n\nDrew Baglino discussed this in his Stanford interview earlier this year, saying that a decade ago Tesla had been too pessimistic about Model S battery cell electrochemical degradation, but too optimistic about the other stuff like pack moisture sealing, battery management electronics, mechanical shock and vibration, and thermal cycling. Notably, Drew said that these things \"don't show up until you've been in the field for ten years\". Yikes. So even the big brains at Tesla were too conservative in some areas and too aggressive in others. It was only after years of vehicles being in the fleet and millions of cars produced that they’ve advanced this far in fixing these problems, making the cars with more reliability, more quality, and less design fat.  \n\n\nTesla also gets the most data per car per unit time. because they actually had the foresight to design the car for remote data collection and cloud computing. Tesla has been putting electronic sensors on their BEVs since \\**2003\\**. One of the very first things they did as a startup was setting up vehicle data collection for trying to reverse engineer the AC Propulsion t-zero prototype. I heard Elon and a few other early Tesla employees talking about this in a panel interview from around the early Model S years (I can’t find it anymore, so no link). I think I recall Elon referring to it as trying to tease out “the ghost in the machine”, because the t-zero used custom analog power electronics and nobody really knew how the hand-crafted mule actually functioned.  \n\n\nAll of this means Tesla alone has the luxury of running the tightest tolerances in the industry for their BEV designs, because no one has has produced 3 million BEVs over the last decade. This is like going camping in the wilderness. A novice might be a smart and conscientious planner, but their unawareness of the actual needs of the trip will inevitably result in worse selection of supplies to bring compared to a person going on the same trip who’s done it many times. The novice will bring along some stuff that’s unnecessary and not bring (or not bring enough of) other stuff that they actually do need. The expert also will have a better understanding of which equipment suppliers have the best options. The expert knows what to spend money on and what to go cheap on. The novice needs to spend more time researching and shopping and even then they will probably end up wasting money in some areas and get junky equipment for other items. The expert’s advantage is information and experience.  \n\n\nNovices can surpass experts in the long run. Tesla sucked at making cars 10 years ago, but that was with some prior learning on the original roadster and Tesla-level pace of innovation. This is not normal progress over the first decade of attempting to grow to being a mass manufacturer of cars. I don’t anticipate an iCar or any other competition having a meaningful negative impact on Tesla’s business for at least ten years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTesla’s data and expertise lets them get by with less stuff such as:  \n\n\n* Structural material\n* Welds\n* Fasteners\n* Battery cell depth-of-discharge reserve\n* Warranty reserve\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTesla also gets performance gains, such as:  \n\n\n* Range per kWh\n* Charging speed\n* Weight\n* More storage space and cabin interior space\n* Handling\n* More repeat sprints before power needs to be throttled\n* NVH (Noise, vibration & harshness)\n\nTesla's inventions compound each other's gains due to these feedback loops, augmenting Tesla's resultant lead.\n\nWeight reduction and chassis stiffening, for example, reduces the power required to move the vehicle around, reduces NVH, and improves handling which makes the vehicle more efficient, which then enables reduction of the battery size needed for a given set of requirements for range and performance. Weight reduction also in many cases increases cabin storage space by opening up more room, as Tesla has shown with their masterful gigacasting design making for more spacious trunks and frunks. Better understanding of battery degradation and better thermal control means that a more aggressive charging curve can be allowed. And so on.  \n\n\nExample of tech with compound benefit:  \n\n\n* Octovalve and integrated thermal management across all vehicle subsystems\n* Gigacastings with optimized new alloy\n* Structural battery with seats directly mounted on top\n* Cell-to-pack architecture\n* Motors best in the game according to Munro testing and cost accounting (kW/$, kW/kg, kW/cm\\^3)\n* 4680 batteries\n* Aerodynamics\n* Cybertruck folded stainless steel stressed skin structure\n\nI don't think it's physically possible for a competitor to try all of this stuff in their first BEV. They have a long road ahead of them to implement these technologies that are necessary to have a product that can compete with Tesla vehicles on specs, features and cost.  \n\n\nEven Tesla is still learning how to optimize their own inventions. Listen to remarks from the Q2 call:\n\n>**Elon Musk:**   \nSo structural pack where we get dual use of the battery cells as structure and as energy storage in the same way that an aircraft gets dual use of the wing as a fuel tank and as a wing is, I think, unequivocally, from a physics standpoint, the superior architecture. It's the A architecture. Now because it is new, we'll start off getting, I don't know, aspirationally a C within an A architecture.  \n  \n>  \n>But the potential is there for to get radically better and then unequivocally better than a battery pack, which is carried like a sack of potatoes.  \n  \n>  \n>**Drew Baglino**  \nYes. And we've gained the perspective through putting our first structural pack in production that it is actually the A architecture. ***Like before we did that, it was a hypothesis that was backed with a lot of modeling and first principles analysis. And now we've actually built and are more confident in that assertion.***  \n  \n>  \n>…  \n  \n>  \n>**Drew Baglino:**  \nGetting to the optimal design, right? **Like** ***you always start with some excess*****.** Some people might call it fat, but that's not really what you think it is initially. **It's that** ***you don't know how lean you can get it until you've done it a couple of times*****.**  \n  \n>  \n>**Elon Musk:**  \nYes. I mean there's some platonic ideal of the perfect product where the atoms -- you have exactly the right atoms and they're in exactly the right position, and you asymptotically approach this platonic ideal. But it takes a lot of effort over time to figure out actually what is the platonic ideal and then actually gradually approach that.  \n  \n>  \n>**Drew Baglino:**  \nYes. I mean, you might need to create a new alloy. Then you need to figure out how to cast it, then you need to ramp the casting machine with the new alloy.  \n…  \n  \n>  \n>**Drew Baglino:**  \nYes, I was going to say the same thing, right? Like we're not just evaluating the pack in idol either. It's the pack plus the body, the integration, do we have mass in the right places, we have the cost in the right places and only just the right amount. And I think we've gone through one iteration. We're going to do another one with Cybertruck.  \nI mean, we're taking the learnings and doing. The next version hopefully is a B-plus in A architecture. That's certainly a target.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***The Rich Get Richer***\n\nAll signs point towards acceleration of Tesla's pace of technological innovation. I think Tesla is in a runaway snowball effect situation now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe EV market has an accumulative advantage dynamic with strong [preferential attachment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preferential_attachment) effects. Preferential attachment means a tendency within a competitive system for resources to be biased towards flowing to entities that already have more resources than other entities (i.e. \"the rich get richer\" / \"success breeds success\"). Preferential attachment was observed by Italian economist/engineer/sociologist Vilfred Pareto in his famous observation that 80% of the peas in his garden came from 20% of the plants and 80% of the wealth and land in Italy was owned by 20% of the families. The early advantage gained by some pea plants due to genetics or lucky position in the environment made them grow bigger more quickly as sprouts, and they leveraged this small advantage to consume more of the local sunshine, water and root space to grow even bigger, until a minority of plants dominated the garden. This relationship shows up in all kinds of phenomena like formation of stars and planets from dust after a supernova, crater size on the moon, frequency of words used in any language, and much more.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPreferential attachment usually results in a [power law distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_law), also known as a Pareto distribution. There are theoretical justifications for this and if you want to see the math I recommend reading the link. The stronger the preferential attachment effect, the steeper the Pareto curve is. Whenever there is a Pareto distribution in results of a competition, we can be pretty confident that some kind of preferential attachment effect exists.\n\n[An example power-law graph](https://preview.redd.it/bqbsl2pz1hn91.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=adee7a0a09017ea4184897095e4c5b10395ff141)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn some cases, we observe power law rank relationships in which one or two outliers exist at the top, way off the trend line. This is called [the king effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_effect). Kings don’t conform to the statistical distribution of the rest, like how China and India have exceptionally large populations while all other nations fit neatly into a Pareto curve.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mge3vylz2hn91.png?width=708&format=png&auto=webp&s=56af0e61515d154b47d639380d9c05f821172a93\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe EV industry in the US, Tesla's home turf, shows a typical Pareto distribution with one king, Tesla, which alone still holds most of the US BEV market share, and holds all of the profit. Soon enough they'll have more profit than all of the rest of the auto industry combined, including all cars, not just BEVs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn a linear scale we can see just how far ahead Tesla is. Note that the pink colulmn is the grand total, the red column is Tesla, and the blue columns are the rest. On a logarithmic scale we can see that the power law model is a good fit, because all the data points fall appromixately in a line. All of them except Tesla, whose sales number comes in an order of magnitude higher than the power law rank relationship would predict.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/efipr6pa3hn91.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=48958f68f88504c8282f4c28bb2d0ade71549451\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jgh917be3hn91.png?width=1232&format=png&auto=webp&s=60f337fe72c2a154728f3c4ce28055742ac9a374\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe dynamics that caused this result are not likely to change any time soon. The rank relationship for 2018 looks almost identical, again with Tesla an order of magnitude ahead of where the Pareto distribution of the rest of the market participants would predict Tesla to be. The numbers have gotten bigger and and the also-rans have shuffled around in the rankings, but in four years nobody has gotten any closer. In fact, if you look closely at the trend lines, Tesla’s deviation from the distribution has almost doubled since 2018, suggesting that indeed they are accumulating relative advantage over time.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6lxcmj4j3hn91.png?width=1226&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe6de49b2cd797ffa9926bfad114fcdffa36a0f4\n\n**Tesla has the lead in data and experience giving better products that cost less:**\n\n    --> Attract customers, investors and employees​\n        --> More scale, more capital​\n            --> Faster iteration cycles, more fun at work​\n                --> More data and experience​\n                    --> Better products that cost less​", "id": "xcku7v", "created_utc": 1663008510.0, "score": 314, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 70, "comments": [{"body": "Tl;dr: Buy TSLA Stock", "score": 187, "replies": [{"body": "Very long, did read: Buy TSLA Stock", "score": 66, "replies": []}, {"body": "![img](emote|t5_n9evv|5717)![img](emote|t5_n9evv|3983)", "score": 38, "replies": []}, {"body": "This was something that stood out very early about Tesla.

They still think Tesla is a car company that has cool tech, this is incorrect.  Tesla is a technology company that makes cars.  Big difference.  \n\nRight now the Tesla car is at the top of the game.  But even though MY is the best selling car by revenue and will likely become the best selling car by unit count (in the world) this year, Elon himself said that without their FSD tech, the car business is (in the long run) worthless.  Fact is anyone can build an EV- it might take them 10 years to catch up to Tesla, but they can.  Tesla's differentiator, the secret sauce, is FSD.  I never really understood the 1 screen thing in M3/MY until I looked at it under the lens of FSD.  There's no dashboard display because the hope is that most of the time you won't need one because you won't be driving.  That's why every Tesla comes with the full FSD hardware suite (which isn't cheap) whether you order FSD or not.  Because the end goal, is once FSD software is perfected, is that all those 'cheap' cars are now eligible for a $15k software upgrade.  And that'll be pure profit for Tesla because all they do in exchange for $15k is push a button.  \n\nLook at solar/powerwall/megapack.  I think the 'virtual power plant' is the initial reveal of a much larger strategy.  Just like everybody thought Tesla was just trying to sell cars, the same mistake is thinking Tesla just wants to sell solar panels and power packs.  I think Tesla's long term goal may be to flat out fix the grid, by turning a totally rigid system into an elastic one.  And there's *billions* to be made there, even just buying power at night and selling it back to the grid during the day when demand is high and they are paying emergency prices.  Look at VPP- they're paying $2/kWh during emergencies.  And you know whatever Tesla is charging the utility is more than $2.  If you can get $2/kWh as a residential customer, what do you think Tesla can get with a few megapacks?  \n\nThen you have the superchargers.  Paired with Megapacks, that'll be another cash cow, buying power at night then selling it to drivers during the day at peak rates.  I think that's a big part of why Tesla is going for J1772 compatibility-- if you're making 100+% profit on your power sales, wouldn't you want the maximum target market?  Especially if it means your installation is paid for by Uncle Sam?  \n\nFinally, AI and Bot.  If you have a humanoid robot and you can tell it (with verbal words) 'put two of these widgets in each box with a receipt from this printer and tape the box shut' and it does it, without complex programming, without needing the widgets spaced exactly on a conveyer belt and the boxes spaced exactly on another belt, that's not worth millions or even billions.  That's worth trillions.  That is the replacement of human labor in probably 25-50% of non-office jobs.  And if the thing works even half decently, companies will buy those by the truck load, because the robot will work 24/7, won't need coffee breaks, won't need to use the bathroom, won't complain if the warehouse has no AC and hits 120°F in the summer, etc.  And if one breaks, you just take a spare one out of the box and give it the same instructions.  \nBut just like the car, the hardware is easy.  You can build a humanoid robot.  Few companies bother to do it, because you need a crap ton of movement axes to even slightly mimic human dexterity, and once you do that, you need a ton of processing and software to do 'simple' stuff like standing up straight and not falling over.  Boston Dynamics is probably the closest one, because they put the R&D into kinematics and dynamics of movement.  Thus you get a humanoid robot that if pushed will stumble but right itself- that alone is a towering achievement.  \n\nPoint is- with every avenue they go in, it seems that Tesla is thinking 10-15 years ahead of everyone else.

So early Teslas were built when the company was very lean and not well capitalized. Rivian and Lucid both have billions of dollars in advance and took a lot of old Tesla employees, but Tesla had to grow lean and learn quickly before anyone really pioneered many of these techniques. On top of that, there were aspects of the car that Tesla attempted to improve on over traditional auto and failed  early (though it has now vastly outpaced traditional auto in manufacturing techniques) but could not really stop production due to cash flow purposes. It is what it is, but it wasn't so bad that it actually made the cars trash; it just was bad enough that people expecting a 50 to 80k car got mad that the car wasn't absolutely perfect. \n\nMany of the issues really stemmed from early production ramps that was extra difficult on the company when it only had Fremont. Trying to upgrade machines, stopping production to fix an issue, trying to speed up production before validating techniques, and not having enough pre-production tests was all a result of having a single factory with a poor layout that was 100% of the cash flow of the business. Now that there is Texas, Shanghai, Fremont, and Berlin, there is enough wiggle room for Tesla to (slightly) slow down production where necessary to ensure higher quality. And giga castings have really helped improve quality as well.\n\nSo is the number 1 priority of Tesla to make a car without panel gaps? No. It is something that Tesla is trying to achieve, but the primary objective is to reduce costs, improve production speed, improve production efficiency, and make sure these techniques are working properly. Panel gaps is incidental, but it is much better than it used to be (and honestly, it didn't even affect the majority of cars back in 2018). I would guess at this point, Tesla Shanghai cars are basically perfect, Berlin cars will be perfect, Austin will be perfect, and Fremont, though fairly close now, will become perfect once all the machines are fully replaced.

{"title": "9-12-22 Spy and Apple Daily Market Analysis", "selftext": "Today was the eve of CPI and easily was one of the weirdest trading days I have seen in a long time… Intraday we watched overall volume trend extreme bull almost all day and despite that SPY struggled most of the day after it hit 411.73 during opening hour. Overall a really tough day to trade. Not only that but the VIX was rising most of the day (which to be expected with CPI tomorrow) and Apple hit 4.3%+ at one point and while Apple was going for ATH it seemed like SPY struggled almost all day. Definitely an interesting disconnected day. I traded until about 1130 and after that I refused to touch it. I didn’t really see any of my idea trade setups today either with the chop and random little dumps SPY would have. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a6gm9s8oohn91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=de4a100d5d0f18425d5532fa13a93c9bd7bf13f0\n\nI am going to keep this TA super short and simple and to the point.. why? Well because in the end while technical 100% matter and eventually tomorrow regardless of a big dump or a big pop SPY will find a key level to hug to but until then its just a guess. So lets look at some bigger “targets.”\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ryn3jouoohn91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=a30c097f2c88154cd936ba0ec57036828e36fda4\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2inf6sbpohn91.png?width=956&format=png&auto=webp&s=6749b63c754a441c8e10040838425b25fd530c3f\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s4qxo4spohn91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea44b7bbf448776fbe75bf9357bbabed4576f2eb\n\nCurrently credit Suisse released a report that they think CPI will be 7.9% and forecast/ consensus is 8.1% and Cleveland fed CPI nowcast which is usually pretty close is predicting 8.22%. Overall we should expect to see CPI hit that 7.9 to 8.2% range tomorrow in my opinion. \n\nSo If we get a bullish CPI reading tomorrow then most likely we will see a big green open. The biggest openings we usually have from CPI at 1.4 to 1.8%. So on average we can say a 1.5% +/- opening regardless of reading. \n\nSo if we get a good CPI reading tomorrow we should expect an opening closer to 417. Which would be pretty huge as this would put us right at key 417.3 level resistance. From there that will be a big fight that rages on. \n\nIf we break through that resistance then we should look for 421.22 gap fill.  \n\nHowever, if we get a bad CPI and expect a -1.5% opening we could see 404.8. This would be significant as it would put us back below key level support if 405.3.\n\nBreaking below key 405.3 we could attempt a gap fill down to 400.86. \n\nOverall we can expect high volatility and a good CPI or a bad CPI in my opinion will guide the markets for the next week until FOMC..\n\nIts hard to give a sold TA based prediction here but in my opinion good cpi + 75bps hike= rally…. Bad cpi and 75bps= rally… bad cpi and anything but 75bps hike= dump… bad cpi and anything but 75bps hike= dump\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pvgblhfqohn91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa99af561852e2fa49270a64b8cbf6f7ba2448cc\n\nApple was an absolutely wild child today! Putting in the biggest green day its had since May 27th which was a 4%+ day. \n\nApple also put in a heavy volume day today hitting 149% of its 30day average by close and 125% of its 10day average intraday range. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xj8z7fzqohn91.png?width=584&format=png&auto=webp&s=40da90dd9d02347a8add0707a0978358cf21cbb8\n\nApple broke through that major resistance from the early august top and that should continue to open up the upside for Apple and the rest of the market as long as CPI comes in strong tomorrow. \n\nWe should expect a solid 3% +/- from Apple tomorrow with a possible range of 168.3 to 158.5. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/akxpttfrohn91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=058f3fc646571020e4edbad0d48400a53469ce8c\n\nNot surprisingly we did see a small green day on the VIX today despite SPY in sell off mode. But that should be expected with CPI tomorrow and the increased “fear” in the market. \n\nI know this post is not like most of my posts but honestly there is little reason to do a complete full blown technical based report when we know that CPI is going to break all norms and cause a bigger move. Tomorrow will be back to your normally scheduled TA… \n\nThe question is what will CPI be? What way will the markets move based on that CPI and what will markets do once they open? \n\n10% challenge-\n\nAs I had said today was one of those days where the way spy and the markets moved none of my ideal setups were hitting and if I had wanted to enter a trade I would have needed to break my rules. I was able to get 3 small trades in but that was about it. After about 1130 I just refused to trade it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tn2hx1zrohn91.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=996b9f4af30633d20acc390edacac2e362ba916d\n\nOverall not a bad start to the week though. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/or4ibuhsohn91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a294e6cad5261771c76b817b01fcba5f4844d35\n\nIf you read my CPI post you know this was my game plan… lets see how we look in about 16 hours… \n\nMy guess on CPI will be that we come in at 8%.", "id": "xcnkng", "created_utc": 1663015304.0, "score": 49, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 73, "comments": [{"body": "It’s quite surprising that the market is fully focused on CPI.
