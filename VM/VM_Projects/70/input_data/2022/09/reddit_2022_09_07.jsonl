But unfortunately i got caught up in the Chess drama that is taking place in the Sinquefield cup 2022\"*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo moving on...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* This post is not about making lambo profits in a day but instead what we do here is we come with unthinkable tactical trading styles like what we do in chess that will help us navigate this  “Stagflationary” and then later on  “Forgotten Depressionary” stock market. Yes guys our situation is that messed up. \n* Also you’re advised to “Do your own research” and not to take this post seriously to a point that you sell your house and start taking trades with me. I don’t provide financial advice here. We just analyze stock market using Naruto references w/o even mentioning Naruto as a figurehead anywhere. \n* Spoiler alert : He will arrive once i think we are close to bull market. xD \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Intro : ( A conversation for fun and entertainment purposes only. )**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*\\* Enter Conference room 1*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMe : “Good morning gentlemen. I think i came up with an interesting idea while i was all high and drunk this weekend”\n\nInvestors : “Really whenever you get all high and drunk we tend to make a whole lot of money. Haha”\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMe : “Guys, it's gonna be a bold statement but I think we are finally heading to our next stage called stagflation. So we might wanna change our strategy that we normally did after 2008 Gfc” \n\nInvestors : “What ? Are you sure about that? How confident are you in your analysis ?”\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Most important research paper from Jackson Hole. Read \\\\\"Four Research paper\\\\\" post.](https://preview.redd.it/3wwiu3yglfm91.png?width=776&format=png&auto=webp&s=520f4048d3e65563e6e86fee23833bb2ba4f6957)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMe : “So i read this paper at Jackson hole symposium that if there is no coordination b/w the government and the Fed then due to fiscal spending the trend based component of inflation will actually move in opposite direction. Adding people/company expectations of the Fed to pivot will cause even more inflation. The Fed is also hiking rates in a recession which at some point is  gonna cause unemployment to rise up to \"NAIRU\" which according to my friend Larry Summers is at 5%.\n\nInvestors : “Interesting. But you see we have never ever everrrr heard on Wall Street of raising rates causing inflation to trend up even more higher or remain stable. How is that even freakin possible ? Did you fail your economics class young man? ”\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMe : “Just so you guys know I only went to my Ecom 101 class and skipped the rest but you see I am pretty confident of the Math done by Francheso and Leonardo. Earlier I had my doubts because Milton Friedman used to tell us inflation is always a monetary phenomenon. I even told Francheso on twitter that.  But after getting high this weekend I think these guys are right. This inflation is very different compared to any we have ever experienced before due to high debt/gdp ratio.\n\nInvestors : “You’re crazy. We are not confident with this investment”\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMe : “I have full autonomy with the investment strategy. You guys already signed the agreement when you used my Wall Street Newsletter analysis”\n\nInvestors : “Do not throw our agreement in our face, Uchiha. We had an underlying understanding that you wouldn't act like a goddamn crazy man. But you always do after watching too many anime. Who even names himself after some cartoon character”\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMe : “ Look guys. This is not crazy. It’s very logical”\n\nInvestors : “So you want us to buy metals, commodities or defensive stocks and eat losses instead of Dcaing index or growth stock until this magical stagflation period not only arrives but stays longer than everyone is expecting. This has only happened just once in history before”\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMe : “That’s correct”\n\nInvestors : “You’re out of your f mind\\*\\* Walk away from the conference room.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMe : \\*Sitting alone. Ringtone buzzing… “Hello”\n\nSecretary : “They are here”\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMe : “Okay tell them to wait in conference room 2.

I even told you that there will be a bull trap rally first. I mean guys c'mon was the \"Danzo vs Sasuke\" video reference not enough for y'all. How will you ever make money ?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Newsletter and the comment that Trader 1 is arguing about.](https://preview.redd.it/hofz49fkmfm91.png?width=1842&format=png&auto=webp&s=020072f323cbd4e63d0e1962704df3184aac67df)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTrader 1 : “But sir although you nailed the first peak and the levels perfectly but you missed the second peak by one day in wall street newsletter 10 ( Predicted august 29/30 i.e. monday/tuesday dump but dump happened on friday aug 26 )  and told us nothing will happen in Jackson Hole in later on non numbered newsletter” ( in comments )\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMe : “ You know what you’re absolutely f’in right trader 1. I am so so stupid that i relied only on my crystal ball 2-3 months ago. Should’ve also consulted with an astrologer too. Maybe I would have nailed the second peak perfectly to the date. \n\nTrader 1 : “Yes sir. We need an astrologer. I heard billionaires have theirs too”\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMe : “Are you f’in stupid. That was sarcasm. Nobody can time the market. Period. Nobody, me including me. God you folks will make me lose my mind. Also you might wanna take that back. Yes I told some individuals that I'm not expecting anything from Powell but I never mentioned such things in a non numbered letter. I only gave you the levels. You could have bought inverse etf’s to prevent theta decay. Did you ?\n\nTrader 1 : \\* Silent \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMe : “Yah i guessed so.\n\n\\*\\*After calming down\n\nMe : “Look guys. I love you guys so much. More than you believe. But if you keep using my letters for timing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to perfect day and levels then you’re gonna miss out on so many easy trades. You have to use these letters just for reference and implement it in your own trading style and not copy pasting it. Guys I am not gonna be right 100% of the time. Just look no further than last week. I said $4017 and $4058 are two profit taking zones and the levels to deploy short. Only the first order and bear short got executed but the second take profit got stopped at breakeven due to some bad economic data.\n\nSo I think I have cleared some confusion that I wanted to but couldn’t as we were all on a break. Now c'mon guys cheer up. Yes you missed out on XXXXXXXX profits but think of this way you didn’t lose money. As Peter Lynch always used to say “Don’t let yourself down just because you missed a 10 bagger stock like microsoft or any other. There will be thousand more investing opportunities in the future” In our case it's thousand more trading zones.\n\nI hope you guys learned your lesson so i give you 5 stars out of 10 for your trading performance. Now you can go and have snacks first. “\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMe -> Traders who made profits.\n\nTrader 2 : “haha. Sir we made a killing in powell week by buying itm and atm puts at your levels.”\n\nMe : “You guys get 4 stars on trading performance just because you followed a cartoon newsletter advice and profited. Get back to work now”\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMoral of the story is based on your interpretation. :)\n\nApologies if that interpretation may have hurt your feelings. That was clearly not my intention.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo at last finally moving on...\n\n**Respected Investors and Traders,**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[\\\\\"Pain = Gain\\\\\" if you're bearish.

If you manage to make it this far  trust me from here things will be interesting :)*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Different type of people using different type of styles on Wall Street :**\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nqebgpdgnfm91.jpg?width=852&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fa1a68b5cbdc8e96daaf9e9dd318defa9b925566\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNormally these are the 12 different type of people on Wall Street.\n\n**1.** ***Johnny Wall Street***  \n\n\nIf you live in New York or are just passing through, you know this guy. He wears custom-made shirts with a dark Prada suit... no tie. In his office, he tells his co-workers to protect him on a lunch print, his cool way of ordering lunch. Johnny Wall says he's a size buyer when he sees a hot chick. He's the last one to show up at his high school reunion driving his newly leased BMW convertible and checking his Rolex.\n\nMy friends and I just call him \"J Wall\" for short.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2.** ***Lax Boy***  \nThis guy is in his late 20s or early 30s and you can bet he grew up in Jersey, Long Island or maybe Westchester. You'll overhear him talking about how he crushed it in Vegas last weekend or how the hostess at Stanton Social was \"vibing\" him last night. He refers to everyone as Bro, Pal, Chief, Guy or Boss.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***3. The Bionic Woman***  \nI wouldn't be surprised if she had nunchucks in her Celine bag. She answers your question before you even ask it. She works harder than the men in her office and is on top of everything. She's impeccably dressed and you'd never know she's already had two babies. The click of her Louboutins on the pavement echo for blocks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***4. The Guy without a GPS***  \nHe took a wrong turn after college. He has a perpetual scowl on his face. He hates Wall Street, but makes more money now than he could by doing anything else. His dad got him the interview and it snowballed from there. He has a girlfriend with pouty lips, but she's on the other side of the bar with her friends.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***5. The Crusty Old Dude***  \nCrusty has white hair and a custom-made suit. Tawny liquor flows like a swirling sculpture in a rocks glass in front of him. He doesn't talk about stocks or bonds; he's more concerned about flow charts and restructuring upper management on a cocktail napkin. When you try to give him money for your drinks he just holds up his hand and looks insulted.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***6. Somebody's Sister***  \nShe doesn't try to use sex appeal to further her career - just the opposite. She saves that for the weekends. She shows up every day ready to work and never appears hungover. She can be spotted crossing the avenue holding a salad and a kale shake.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***7. The Really Good Looking Bad Boy***  \nHe was valedictorian, three-sport captain in high school and majored in charm. With his modelesque features and charismatic smile, he'll steal your heart - and your 401(k). Do you really think the Devil would dress like the Devil if he were actually the Devil?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***8. The Husband Hunter***  \nThis girl has no desire to climb the corporate ladder. She's on Wall Street for one reason and one reason only: fishing in a husband hatchery. She doesn't care about Sheryl Sandberg; the only reason she's leaning in is to show you her cleavage. (Call me.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***9. The Stephen Hawking and Bridget Jones Love Child***  \nHe made it to Wall Street because he's scary smart - and you want him on your team - but he's so socially awkward it's painful. He can even sneak the word \"duration\" in explaining how long it took him to go to the bathroom. Still, there's something lovable about him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***10. Austin Powers***  \nHe's just a dude - laid back and works relatively hard. But he's undercover. You can't catch him talking about business unless he's at a steakhouse with other suits.

I'm Doing God's Work Man***  \nHe's the busiest guy on Wall Street - just ask him. He wears his uniform proudly and acts like trading stocks is as important as finding a cure for cancer. He can be found yelling at his wife through his cell phone at all hours of the day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***12.*** ***The Unusual Suspect***  \nHe's a family man. His office is adorned by 3rd grade artwork and soccer photos. He'll kick back a couple drinks with you at a bar near Pier 11, Grand Central or Penn Station.

As Gandhiji used to say, \"Hear out the bad information from one ear and throw it outside from the other ear\". Reason being this is what \"they\" wanted to tell us through yahoo and cnbc articles. Allow me to show you my perspective which btw is totally crazy. So choose whichever article you want to believe.\n    \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Have you guys ever heard of Dreamwalk ?** \n\n ( If anyone knows Mr Wonderful \"Kevin O' Leary\" tell him to get a medical diagnosis. Dude was in my dreams instead of Taylor swift )\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell if you didn't that's what we will be doing today is deep diving inside the minds of four different types of people using trading strategies in the stock market. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is very important to know who you’re trading against and their styles because you never know when this information may come in handy. Think of it like a game of chess where you study your opponent's moves and then come up with a plan beforehand to gain a slight edge over him. ( That is how my friend beat Carlsen. But the question is was the info leaked? )\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1.** ***Retail / FI / Youtube & Twitter guru’s trading strategy :*** \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[SPY](https://preview.redd.it/s751y2wtnfm91.png?width=1917&format=png&auto=webp&s=e93beace8ae97b4c73ba6128579ac74be57422ba)\n\n[QQQ](https://preview.redd.it/zi07hbwtnfm91.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=600ab012158cb037b129846265cc08757e07dedc)\n\nTheory : This is what I called a retail level based analysis. The retail people use their beloved SPY and QQQ chart and assume that there are major supports and resistances in the chart with a crayon trend line slicing those moving averages. For indicators they use stochastic rsi / rsi with macd and see whatever works. But these types of analysis never give you the time or perfect levels to buy but yah DCAing multiple levels look like a good strategy to them. But unfortunately these people don't know when to sell. ( They only know catching a falling knife )\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo currently a retail is bearish ( coz Fed pivot got smashed by powell and 200dMA f’ed them bad ) and would say\n\nSPY Buy : $369, 362, 339\n\nQQQ Buy :$269, 237, 231\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***2.

I love this style because I outsource all the dirty work to investment bankers. So the cheaters call your Jamie Dimon and other ceo of banks to forward them the levels to buy and sell. The technicians in the respective banks make the different charts according to the data that will be coming. But all charts reach the same conclusions i.e. the levels to buy and sell. Finally these levels are forwarded to the signal app chat of the cheaters.\n\nApparently the signal ceo and I are friends so we just read their message and take trades. xD\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBuy zones :\n\nSpx : 200wMA ie. $3400-3600 at oct 1 or 2nd trading week.\n\nAnd just buy nasdaq when spx hit these levels. I am not giving a Nasdaq sheet. I gotta keep something for me :)\n\nSell zones :\n\nSpx : x.xx% retrace at November 2 or 3rd trading week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNote : Everybody knows this technique by now that 2008 = 2022 be it vix or s&p500. That’s why i am so bored and have lost interest in markets.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow at last i guess things to make even more unpredictable we have.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***4.

So if you wanna apply this technique then prepare yourself for a -20% from $4300 ( we covered this level ) to $3400-3500 by oct 2nd week. Funny thing is it matches with our banking cheat sheet. So maybe even worse than this ig ie. $2875 my 100mMA. :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Note :** I have discounted the **\"Noob level strategy\"** by people who just buy and sell based on other people analysis or by Yolo'ing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Result :**\n\n*How to use this info ?* \n\nWe attack first by our shorts.
