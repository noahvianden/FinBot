In this market do not hold over night. Period. I debated holding puts yesterday overnight. I stuck to my rule, if I held I would have been negative this am. \n\n3. Check the govt website for upcoming events. You need to know what is coming bc the market can change quickly. Do not attempt to make money on major events unless you are experienced at trading options. \n\n4. Never have more than 20% of your portfolio in one trade. \n\n5. Take profit as soon as you hit a set amount. Do not be greedy, you will lose being greedy. Ex.
