As long as you expect it to *eventually* make it back past the 200/share price, you're still making money off the initial investment as well as a slight return from the DCA when it dropped lower and you still bought. \n\nThe other side to that (since nobody can predict the market) is; you buy in at 200/share and the stock starts rising, never to see 200again.
