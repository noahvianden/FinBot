Short of a nuclear strike, in which case the entire market would crash and life on Earth as we know it would end, you'd be fine.\n\nIf you're willing to be more patient, this would produce the same result, but with more than 3x the premium:\n\nSTO SPY 7 Oct 300.00 P@0.16\n\nIf your life depended on using short puts to generate some amount of cash with negligible risk within two weeks, this would work reliably.\n\nThe real question that you need to ask is: Which type of play on SPY can I construct that would allow me to reliably outperform it with less risk than buying and holding SPY over the same period of time? You would want the play to work in these bear market conditions, which are characterized by high and unpredictable volatility, where SPY is more likely than not to drop by 10% to 20% within the next year.\n\nI would set a **hurdle rate** of 2.00% within 30 days, your minimal goal, and then think about what might work best. Let's say that you're working with $10,000.00. Your goal would then be to make $200 within 30 days by executing some type of play on SPY.\n\nWhatever you do, I think that you'll need to think carefully about how to scale into your play. Execute a quantity of one. Wait for the release of the CPI on Thu 13 Oct at 8:30 am ET to see how the market will react. Execute another quantity of one, perhaps adjusting your striking price, etc.\n\nYour main focus always has to be on anticipating and managing risk *before* you ever execute any play. Write what you would do down on paper (that is, Microsoft Word). Compare potential plays with alternatives.\n\nI suggest avoiding shorting puts because if you go sufficiently far OTM to guarantee a win, you'll hardly make any money at all, and it would take a jaw-dropping amount of buying power. Scaling into a *Long Call Spread* or a *Long Put Spread* might work, but regardless of what you wind up doing, it's important to keep in mind the [POWcycle](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/vo71hf/powcycle_trapdoors_into_the_abyss/).\n\nIn general, avoid the one-week period leading up to the release of the CPI each month, and possibly one or two days after it. (Put another way, take advantage of that period opportunistically.) And avoid the one-week period leading up to the FOMC's rate announcement, followed by The JPow's press conference half an hour later, every six weeks. Take advantage of the POWcycle by aligning the timing of your trades with it, rather than ignoring it (which you'd do at your own very great peril). The POWcycle will continue throughout 2022, and probably much longer.\n\nI also recommend that you do some statistical research on SPY's behavior within whichever DTE interval you pick, to see what the worst-case drop is likely to be, and plan accordingly. You can do this by learning the basics of Python and using it to connect to QuantConnect to download data. It's not hard, and they give lots of sample code. You can import the data into Excel, or R, to run simple descriptive statistics on it.\n\nDon't guess. Do the work necessary to design a strong (that is, very high probability) trade. I don't recommend making a directional bet, particularly a bullish one, because you'd be gambling on a relief rally. Gambling (an irrational form of hoping for a miracle) is the antithesis of designing a strong play and will reliably lose money if repeated. There is no edge there, only (usually bad) luck. What you need is a statistically-backed edge that leads to a strongly designed play. That involves running a research project. It wouldn't take very long once you got python and QuantConnect connected.\n\nIf you do this work, you'll have an edge over the 99.99% of retail traders who won't, and you'll set yourself up well to compete against the algos of the hedge funds, prop trading firms, investment banks, et al.\n\nAt bottom, if you take a reasonable amount of risk, your return will be quite small, but nonetheless positive, and in these market conditions, that's about the best that anyone can reasonably go after. What matters is having a repeatable, rational process that will give you an edge. It needs to be backed by statistics, by actual results. Without this, you'd be gambling, and over a large sample size, gamblers consistently lose money.\n\nThe bottom line is that you can make a tiny amount of money, but options trading won't do more than that in these market conditions. Save the high-risk plays for 2024 or 2025. Getting to a point where the market will be stable will take a long, long, long, long time, and will likely involve a slowly burning market crash. Most people won't know what hit them because they'll be boiled alive like the proverbial frog, one degree at a time. (Actually, it'll be more like 1℉, 1℉, 1℉, and then unexpectedly 7℉, followed by -3℉, then 1℉, then 1℉, etc.)\n\nRelief rallies will destroy the capital of most traders who think that the bottom is finally in. We are light years and geological epochs away from that point.\n\nGood Luck,\n\nArtem", "score": 38, "replies": [{"body": "what do STO SPY and DTE mean exactly?", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "STO = Sell to Open (the trade)\n\nIn this case, we're talking about shorting a put.

You can't hit a bullseye unless you can see it.\n\nWhat's the goal vector? It consists of four elements:\n\n1. **Capital**: How much do you have to work with? Let's say $10,000.00.\n2. **Target**: What target gain (hurdle rate) are you after? +2.00%.\n3. **Deadline:** By when? In 30 days.\n4. **Risk**: How much $x are you willing to lose?

There's *got* to be an easier way to make just $200 in one month than by trying to short puts on SPY that strike 30% below where it's trading right now, which would require multiple millions of dollars in buying power just to get going! Maybe this short put SPY idea isn't the right approach.\n* So, this POWcycle thing that Random Artem talks about. If the CPI comes in hot on Thu 13 Oct—it might not, but it pays to be prepared—and there's a huge **freakout**, and the market crashes big-time (again!), how can I take advantage of the *massive* expansion in IV that that would create? Maybe I should run short puts on something like PLTR or STNE at prices that are way below where they are now. That would take a *lot* less buying power than trying to short puts on SPY, and the premiums would be jaw-droppingly higher.\n* Erm…so what's the deal with these *Long Call Spread* or *Long Put Spread* plays that people do? By themselves, with a quantity of one, they hardly make any money at all. But what if I learned to design, say, a really strong *Long Call Spread* on STNE, PLTR, SE, or ZS, and then scaled (the heck!) into it, not all on the same day after a crash, so as to avoid it crashing way more on me, and way more again?\n* And what's the deal with these **adjustments** to plays, such as a *Long Call Spread*, that I occasionally stumble across vague references to? Just WTF is an adjustment, anyway? How would it work for a *Long Call Spread*?\n* Who (the hell) is this Artem guy, anyway, and is he just going to keep me hanging?

Usually just the short leg but if busy, both.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "A lot to unpack here. I’ll try my best to answer all of your questions. I’m by no means an expert at this strategy. But here we go. \n\n1. I usually check the 5-7 delta. The width will vary based up volatility and expected move. The higher the volatility, the further away the 5-7 delta strikes will be. This question is difficult to answer because it changes based upon the projected move for the day. So the strikes vary. \n\n2. There’s a couple reasons I feel this is best. The earlier you open, the further away your strikes are. Plus it’s more of a theta play instead of a delta play. Lately it seems the bigger moves are occurring in the first 30 minutes. So I try to wait that out. Ideally I try to let my trades expire worthless. Mainly to avoid pattern day trade issues. However, I think I’m going to change that and start closing them out early to avoid those late day swings. \n\n3. I’ve been targeting about $1.30 to $1.50 per contract. \n\n4. That’s correct. So my buying power reduction is roughly 2k per contract. \n\n5. I used to do that. Now I try to just close the whole position once my 3X is breached on the short. I’m mainly doing this because of pattern day trade rules. Plus I feel it helps out in the event of double stops. They rare. But the last one hurt me pretty bad. I’m trying to get better with my stops to minimize my losses. \n\n6. I use tastyworks. So I can’t really set my stop losses automatically. I monitor them manually. Plus I prefer to close out the whole position. I need to get better about this because I’ve let some losers run a little too far. \n\n7. I have ignored them and I’ve been burned pretty bad. I think the key with this strategy is to cut your losses sooner rather than later. When I’m following my plan correctly, I’ll make up my loss and a little extra on my next win. \n\n8. Unfortunately I do not. I mainly try to keep track of my monthly profit and losses. I’m still tweaking the strategy around a little here and there to see what works best. \n\n9. I have opened the trade at random intervals. Overall, I’d been pretty successful regardless of time. I feel like it’s more successful the earlier you open. The interval I’ve done the second most is probably and hour and a half before the close. I had some success with it. But overall, it was much more stressful and my stops would get tested rather quickly. Also, I noticed it’s much more difficult to stick to your stops later in day. Price can jump quickly causing some nasty stops. I’ve gotten out as high as 6X loss in the short leg because the market moved so quickly. \n\n\nHopefully that answers most of your questions. It’s definitely not an exact science and still a work in progress. I know I mentioned it a couple of times. But how you manage your risk and stop losses odd huge. I feel like I’m getting close to having it dialed in. \n\nYou’re targeting .40 in premium per side or for both?  Your win rate is really high. So it seems like you’re doing something right. How wide are the wings you’re using?  It sounds like you’re in and out of the market a lot. I’m assuming your account is over 25k since you aren’t too concerned about pattern day trade rules?", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for taking the time. Data is the key to success here so the more data I (or you) can obtain; the better outcomes will be achieved. I refined my strategies based on that data. \n\n\nIt would be interesting to see what the break even movement % your spreads have. \n\n\nI would really encourage you to track your entries. Simple excel sheet: date time quantity strikes premiums and then exits. Ideally you track the delta gamma theta too but that’s extra work. \n\n\nLast few months have been more volatile then historical. So that has sucked. >3% days are supposed to be fairly rare. \n\n\nThat is an enormous premium. Maybe see if you can close it earlier for even 1/3? That likely will cause your rate of loss to plummet and put you on the path to low losses, low drawdowns, and sick compound profits. \n\n\nWhat benefit are you seeing going with that 20 width? Honestly it’s better than 5. It’s the same capital and same or better net premium. Lower fees. \n\n\nWhy doesn’t tasty allow you to set up a stop loss on options? That’s lame. Maybe consider another broker? Pretty critical. That probably helps with not ignoring them. \n\n\nDefinitely agree though. Don’t open the last 2hr. It’s small premium and the end of day movements are way too wild. I don’t even like to keep my spread open that late but sometimes I’m so far away it’s low enough risk. \n\n\n0.40 avg per side yeah. Capturing about 0.37 of that on average. Lately been Moving down even further though. 0.35, 0.30, lowest is 0.20. I’d rather play it safe then risk a loss since the losses take 5-6 wins to recoup. \n\n\nIt’s also a factor of being too greedy right? On a 5 spread, that’s 500 collateral, and a net premium of 0.30 is 6% if it can expire to zero, if you open both sides that’s 12% for a day. That’s HUGE. \n\n\nPlug that into compounding for 100 days and you’ll see. It’s massive. \n\n\nSo what’s the big deal if you open those 0.30 each side and then close it for 0.20 profit; 0.40 total, still 8% return for the day. Still awesomely huge. \n\n\nDoesn’t make a difference in the end after 100-200 days, only losing makes a difference, so you have to avoid losing either way and the only way to consistently do that is by reducing your risk which means lowering the net premium.\n\n\nTo specifically answer: \n\n\n5 width but I don’t disagree that 10, 15, or 20 work. I don’t but should check the RoC of each one. If you can get higher RoC with wider spread which lowers your risk, that’s awesome. I just don’t because time is of the essence to enter and don’t have any good tools that would auto calc that for me. \n\n\nNot in and out of market a lot at all. The contrary. I’ll open and if I’m hesitating at all I won’t do all money. I’ll sit a bit and re assess and deploy the rest if comfortable. \n\n\nIf market has raced up say 1% in first hour when I do my entry I won’t enter the put side. The risk of stock dropping back down is too high whereas the risk of stock going up another 1.5% is low, so I would rather do a call spread than a put spread. So I’ll just do that. \n\n\nIf falls on open do the opposite. \n\n\nIf the open is fairly flat then I’ll do both sides. \n\n\nIf after 1hr from opening the market did go down 1% to flat, you can probably close that call spread for a decent profit and then use that gamma to open a nice put spread fairly deep. Then let that expire to the end of day probably or close to it. \n\n\n\nYeah >25k so no issues. Not even aware of this issue sorry. What is the barrier?

It’d probably help me get a better picture of what’s going in and refine my system that much better. \n\nI’ve considered closing out sooner. But it doesn’t seem too difficult to collect most of the premium. That’s also one of the benefits of using wider wings. You collect much more premium that way. Also like you mentioned, the fees are less. The pattern day trade rule is restrictive in that sense though. I’d prefer to let my trades expire worthless. \n\nTastyworks allows stops in the short strikes only. I’d much prefer to set a stop on the entire position. I’ve considered switching brokers over this. But supposedly they’re working on changing that. Plus they allow for one pattern day trade rule reset every 90 days. Which is really nice. \n\nGotcha. So you’re still able to scale in without much issue?  It sounds like you aren’t taking these trades to expiration?  The returns sound similar to what I’m doing. I average between 5 to 6 percent return on capital. \n\nTo answer your question about the pattern day trades, you only get 3 pattern day trades in a rolling 5 day period.
