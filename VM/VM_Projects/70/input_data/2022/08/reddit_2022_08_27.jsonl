{"title": "Be careful with your puts!", "selftext": "FYI - options (puts) should be used to hedge your positions not to get you rich overnight.\nStay humble and don't overdo. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------\nedited FYI2 - Post was intended for new investors/traders that have just started using options and are affected by the Dunning-Kruger effect. New traders usually end up losing money, so be careful. \nTo support my view:\nhttps://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/retail-investors-lose-big-options-markets-research-shows \n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n●There are low chances that you will be the next Burry. \n\n●Don't time the market. June proved to many that they suck at timing the market, while people who timed it right; congrats and ...you know what. Enjoy your luck. Don't fomo puts, because you can get burned like bears couple of weeks ago. I still remember people saying that \"it can't get any higher, it will crash next Monday, Im buying puts\" to just see market showing them big green middle finger.\n\n●Red days after such rally are healthy, so don't act like it's the begging of the big crash. It can crash or go sideways, definitely it will go to the right. That's all we know. Don't rush things and buy puts asap after reading one youtube video or a few comments on Reddit.\n\n●You will compete on the whole different level than just buy/sell shares strategy... If you need advice whether you should buy Apple or Meta, or if you should buy now or during crash, then most probably options are not for you. If you don't believe me, Google why retailers are losing on options.\n\n●\"Market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent\" is exactly about playing puts. \n\n●If you get rock solid seeing these massive gains from puts, jerk off for the post nut clarity, then read about the survivorship bias. \n\nHappy to see others opinions.

Then one guy mentioned where he got it from.  In 2008, in the midst of a recession, before wsb proved to the world (with GME) that it doesn't matter how bad a business is if enough people get on board to fight the shorts, Porsche bought VW.  Their price shot up to $1258 a share basically overnight, and they were shorted less than BBBY.  They weren't on RegSHO.  The situation for BBBY has more potential if a merger is announced due to a number of factors.\n\nEven just comparing it to GME, we are in a generally better position with one massively important difference: the world already knows GME can happen.  You want to talk about FOMO?  People don't buy in FOMO unless they believe a thing can happen, and thanks to GME, they don't need faith.  It's been proven.  They just need to climb aboard.  GME went how high with most of the world thinking it was impossible?  But now, they know it is.\n\nIt could flop.  It could be awful.
