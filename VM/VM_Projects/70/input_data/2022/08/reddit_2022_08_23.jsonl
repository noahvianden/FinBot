{"title": "Bank Of America Warns Of ‚ÄòTextbook‚Äô Bear Market Rally, Predicting New Lows For Stocks", "selftext": "Though stocks have mounted a stunning comeback from June lows as investors grow more optimistic about cooling inflation and the Federal Reserve potentially scaling back interest rate hikes, the recent rebound is nothing more than a ‚Äúclassic bear‚Äù market rally which is likely to hit new lows, according to analysts at Bank of America.\n\nThe summer stock market rally looks to be almost over, according to a recent note from Bank of America chief investment strategist Michael Hartnett, who points to data suggesting that recent gains are a ‚Äútextbook‚Äù bear market rally which is poised to soon run out of steam.\n\nThe S&P 500 has jumped more than 15% since hitting a low point for the year in mid-June, in large part thanks to better-than-expected economic data‚Äîincluding a strong jobs report and cooling in consumer prices‚Äîin recent weeks.\n\nDespite investor hopes that the worst has passed after a brutal selloff in the first half of 2022, analysts at Bank of America are among experts ramping up warnings in recent weeks that stocks still have further to fall.\n\n‚ÄúEveryone is bearish but no one has sold stocks,‚Äù Hartnett says, pointing to irrational trading activity in meme stocks and adding that after four straight weeks of gains, the market is showing many characteristics of what is likely to be a ‚Äúself-defeating rally.‚Äù\n\nThe Bank of America analyst points to the fact that out of 43 bear market rallies since 1929 in which the S&P 500 gained over 10%, the average increase is roughly 17.2% over 39 trading days‚Äîmeaning that the current rally appears to be maxed out, according to historical data.\n\nWhat‚Äôs more, even after increasing the federal funds rate by 2.25% so far this year, the Federal Reserve is ‚Äúnowhere near done‚Äù with rate hikes to combat inflation, he warns, which will likely put a ceiling on recent market gains.\n\nWHAT TO WATCH FOR:\n\nOther analysts at the firm have issued similar warnings in recent days. Bank of America‚Äôs head of U.S. equity and quantitative strategy, Savita Subramanian, said in a note to clients on Tuesday that stock market valuations remain far too high for the bear market to be over. A sustained bull market remains ‚Äúunlikely,‚Äù she wrote, citing indicators that instead signal a looming end to the recent bear market rally.\n\nSURPRISING FACT:\n\nA bear market rally tends to ‚Äúalways narrow‚Äù in terms of leadership, Hartnett adds, pointing to the fact that the likes of Apple, Amazon and Tesla have accounted for outsized portions of the market‚Äôs recent rebound. Those three stocks have each risen by more than 30% since the market low point on June 16, far outpacing the benchmark index.\n\nSource: [https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2022/08/19/bank-of-america-warns-of-textbook-bear-market-rally-predicting-new-lows-for-stocks/?sh=7671430d2ac5](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2022/08/19/bank-of-america-warns-of-textbook-bear-market-rally-predicting-new-lows-for-stocks/?sh=7671430d2ac5)\n\nBank of America (BAC) chief investment strategist Michael Hartnett says the market's recent gains is a ‚Äútextbook‚Äù bear market rally which is set to soon run out of steam.

New CEO Alan Masarek who was the CEO of Vonage  took Vontage from  $3.51 to $10 then stepped away at the peak, so he's not a chode.

Here's bull porn snippet from the article:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/85o7815eyij91.png?width=1556&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc752486752b351e8431bdf787a439b3ac27950f\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, recently filings show activist investor with twitter fingers hulking shares. August filings also show that other funds have joined the game swallowing shares with such fervor would think  they work for OnlyFans. The net effect of  so much buying is that  reduction of shares is starting to show up in  short metrics.\n\n# Today‚Äôs filing [[link](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001418100/000089924322029450/xslF345X03/doc4.xml)]\n\nDude named King Theodore Walker Cheng-De ( *the activist investor*)  spammed the buy button on Avaya and is now a 15%+ holder.

A few weeks later he decides to double dip and get around 1.8m more shares so now he owns 13,231,350 shares . Nice now he owns 15.4% of shares outstanding.\n\nFrom [https://whalewisdom.com/stock/avya](https://whalewisdom.com/stock/avya) we have the following whales with filings as recent as 8/15 and no later than 8/9\n\n**Vanguard owns**: 9,531,774  - 11%\n\n**Capital World**: 8,369,041 - 9.7%\n\n**Blackr0ck**: 7476,255 - 8.7%\n\n**American Centurry Companies**: 5,950,649 - 6.9%\n\n**Theodore** \\- 12,231,360 = 14.41%\n\nTotal = **43,559,079**\n\nNot going to keep going but just showing that other funds have been ape‚Äôing into shares of Avaya as recently as last week.\n\nSo, we have a stock thats -98% from its 2021 high with a recent vocal activist investor, we have multiple funds ape'ing to Avaya this month, and new CEO and new management. If AVAYA pays off 2.25% 2023 convertible note with the  $221 million in escrow, or if they release a 8k regarding a turnaround plan, or if more filings come out showing that even more tutes are loading it should fly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g6k462njyij91.png?width=566&format=png&auto=webp&s=4699650fe8c7cb22a94130b9aa00b0a88917699e\n\nYou may notice that Avaya market gap is 60million, yet they have $404million of cash on hand, and $221m cash in escrow.

(2) Theodore King bought more shares (3) Theodore released a letter 5page letter about Avaya.\n\nCan view Theo‚Äôs letter here direct here in the 13g filing: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001418100/000119312522227517/d359845dsc13ga.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001418100/000119312522227517/d359845dsc13ga.htm)\n\nYou can read his thesis for why he‚Äôs spamming Avaya aggressively for millions and selling puts. His letter is  instructive, and a better summation than my smoothed brain can manage. If you skim through you‚Äôll see Theo has a PT of $25.\n\nWant more bull porn?

Avaya's software is very prevalent btw basically every company uses them.\n\n# Hold up wait need the squeeze weather forecast:\n\nCan see above that juicy setup, CTB/ON-LOAN/UTLIZATION increasing, while on-loan avg age is decreasing to flat. So I interpret this as shares being sucked from float making the short metrics rise. In fact, we know that total shares outstanding 85,836,560. If we add up all the shares 6 funds mentioned earlier own we get 43.5m shares. So that's around 50% of shares outstanding. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/60ljsjynyij91.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=4fec358aed8a024f8187e2a5a2da05a86941abfb\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3ho2d4nwyij91.png?width=1350&format=png&auto=webp&s=793ba172a75279f0b37e389a1253e50869b7b314\n\n&#x200B;\n\nChecking the price and volume can see volume increasing, rsi getting a bit of legs, but more importantly can see we are at the absolutely ground floor, even with Avaya impressive performance on an absolute puke day for the market.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWrapping things up SI is 20% of float since 15m shares are sold short . Given  that Avaya has 85,836,560 shares outstanding and if we add the 6 funds mentioned early stakes we come to **43,559,079** shares locked up   by tutes. So, let's do some math for the float: 85.837m-43.55m =42.337m. I only did this quickly and roughly there are other holders if you want you can go to [https://whalewisdom.com/stock/avya](https://whalewisdom.com/stock/avya) yourself and calculate. ***However, given this info can reasonable say that the 36% of float is close to shorted, and kinda of explains the increase in short metrics while the average age of loans is flat - tutes sucking shares away.***\n\nSo to recap the activist investor Theo is active on Twitter (always a plus) check the language below to see why this is good.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j2wtn92e0jj91.jpg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0ff6925db89ee3cd4a3a74ef8ad98cc5a31c58db\n\nHe‚Äôs not alone in the August 13f's  filings shown that  other firms have also opening up significant positions, solid new CEO doing the media circuit, short metrics solid and juicy, activist investor throwing out a $25 PT and JP Morgan reaffirming $7, lastly Avaya market cap is 60m have 404million cash on hand and 221m cash restricted in escrow and have guided revenue of $712m and have authorized 147m in buybacks. ***You want even more DD?*** Check activist investor Theodore's thesis he posted on google drive *(link:* [*https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eycdOLuup\\_onwAWfMWmu1AgjR\\_68HzPa/view*](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eycdOLuup_onwAWfMWmu1AgjR_68HzPa/view) *which is now in the 13g filing* [*https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001418100/000119312522227517/d359845dsc13ga.htm*](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001418100/000119312522227517/d359845dsc13ga.htm)*)*.\n\nYou may not realize now, but I this is  a bomb.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/59rzo8tvyij91.gif\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Made a mistake in my calculations edited.\n\nwhat;s the mistake?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xid7k0uouyj91.png?width=2764&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d98d6c4c8a577ce01fbab68ee9d083d2d16b62f\n\nPRN according to whalewisdom means shares associated with converitble debt, so once the price goes past a certain point holders can exercise.

I think he‚Äôs implying a squeeze without saying it directly. Hence the quote \"*The market topology at present time is highly favorable*\" and \"*significant short covering of the 14.98M shares currently short,*\" which is pretty clear.... on pg 3.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Between now and October 1st 2022 when the 8% 2027 Notes become convertible ‚Äì prior to this date, if there is a sharp upward movement in price, there would likely be significant short covering of the 14.98M shares currently short, which would reflexively need to be purchased and likely with sequential failure to deliver events, given the technical inability to convert the Notes into Common Equity according to the Indenture. In turn, this could bring the 2027 8% Notes back ITM and very likely above par.  \n>  \n>Furthermore, the market making operations in Avaya‚Äôs common equity are highly unusual given the trading volume relative to the free float (\\~48M shares traded in the 24-hour period of August 19th).

So I'm getting a bit confused  but CB holders can covert for $3.42 a share October 1st, I see incentive for them to do this if if the price is above this level after this date? If it's above this level it implies rapid price appreciation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHopefully, someone chimes in and helps me analyze this. A unique situation.

Still significant, however the two 8% holders have not filed a 13d/13g so I assume they are still in making it 75% short.
