{"title": "How Tesla has conquered EV Batteries whilst the 'competition' struggles ...", "selftext": "***How Tesla has the best Electric Vehicle batteries 🔋 on the market, and they've successfully secured their supply of these batteries for the foreseeable future. Something Competitors HAVEN'T done....***\n\nThe Battery quite literally powers the entire vehicle, it is thus not strange that for the average Electric Vehicle the battery accounts for ***50%*** of the production costs! Despite the market not knowing how to react to Tesla’s 4Q earnings call, there was some hidden gem hidden in the recent news that most people simply aren’t understanding. It is something that is going to be a key factor in determining which companies survive the future in the Automotive industry, and Tesla has already secured their place. Let me tell you….\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9566snguy6g81.jpg?width=1832&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=944e2b63e46b57163432fb25a221ed48be866f2e\n\n**Why are batteries so expensive and important?**\n\nThe future of Electric Vehicles will be constrained by the amount of available high-quality batteries, Elon musk himself even said in a 2018 tweet that:\n\n“Tesla vehicle production is limited by total battery output.”\n\nThis is still true in 2022 and will continue to be the case for the foreseeable future, until battery production meets the demand for Electric Vehicles. Batteries are so important because they account for such a large portion of the vehicles cost, but why are they so expensive? This is mainly due to the materials that make up the battery, due to the fact that the batteries need to be rechargeable the batteries use lithium-ion or sometimes also Nickel batteries.\n\nThe components that make the cathode (such as nickel, lithium or even cobalt) are the most expensive. This is because they need to be mined, processed into high-purity chemical compounds and THEN they’re set-up to be used in the battery. Although over the last few years battery prices have dropped 81% since 2013, their scarcity remains an issue\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yakbj46vy6g81.png?width=978&format=png&auto=webp&s=28cd50f212f879ce8db412c8001cded643ae3247\n\nThe demand for electric vehicles is simply out-pacing battery production. So you better hope your favourite car manufacturer has enough batteries to supply their vehicles. Unfortunately, this isn’t the case. Yet Tesla has positioned themselves not only to have the best performing batteries with the new 4680 batteries, they’re also continuously securing contracts for long-term supply of raw materials and batteries to power their 50% YoY volume growth for the fore-see able future.\n\nBefore you continue, Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my independent research and work!\n\nTesla has ensured that they are limiting the battery constraints for volume production whilst competitors are stumbling around the in the dark. Just look at the Fourth Quarter comments (below) made by “major-competitor“ Ford compared to Tesla’s comments regarding their battery capacity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q0ncyduvy6g81.png?width=1048&format=png&auto=webp&s=6ab31ad506263bcb686641e7d3a8a0513021f4eb\n\nNow let me talk about those 4680’s I mentioned and recent developments that have made Tesla’s battery supply even more robust.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aer8engwy6g81.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c35da5aae8962e8925e06613587f5c98593adede\n\n**4680’s & New Contracts - Tesla’s Battery advantage**\n\nTesla announced on September 2020 in their Battery Day conference that they where making the new and improved 4680 battery cells. These are currently being built in California but soon will also be built in Texas and are being supplied by Panasonic to help scale Tesla production. What is the importance of the 4680 cells for Tesla vehicles?\n\n· Changing from the currently used 2170 cells to the 4680s will increase range by 24% \\*\n\n· 5 X reduction in electrical path means you will be able to super charge faster\n\n· The thermal management of the entire battery pack is improved so the cell cooling will be much more efficient\n\n· The dollar costs per kilowatt hour should be reduced by 50%. That is an estimated decreased cost of production of about $7,000!\n\nBelow you can see an image from Battery day regarding the total benefits graphically:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kr63ov7xy6g81.png?width=1713&format=png&auto=webp&s=cfbd8e5c25b2c3304260b6f9c8dc5a124fe9b56c\n\nOk so now you understand how important the 4680 battery cells are and that battery cells will be the main constraint for the production of future electric vehicles, let’s have a look at how Tesla is securing their battery supply.\n\nSecuring these batteries, and specifically the 4680’s is a crucial step that Tesla wants to complete to ensure they maintain the biggest market share of the entire Electric Vehicle industry. Elon Musk said in 2021:\n\n“So in Texas, we’re building the Model Ys with the structural battery pack and the 4680 cells, and we’ll start delivering after final certification of the vehicle, which should be fairly soon.”\n\nSo Tesla needs to be able to supply their cars using the 4680s really quickly and at a pace such that the batteries aren’t a bottleneck for production. The 4680 is also incredibly important for 2022 and 2023 when production of the Cybertruck will start.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2ixgm3pxy6g81.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=63a9e0c6fa4bd77b2a8480e69505e569cb902a84\n\nThe 4680 cells will provide the Cybertruck with the needed strength and power to move the huge truck around. Just recently Tesla purchased a large order with Panasonic to increase their supply of 4680 cells, Panasonic CFO Hirokazu Umeda said:\n\n“Tesla has put in an extremely strong request for the 4680, so when we are actually able to deliver the 4680, we plan to put top priority on Tesla. We’ll first prioritize supplying Tesla once the verifications are complete.”\n\nMeanwhile competing auto manufacturers are struggling to provide any significant amount of Electric Vehicles and will continue to struggle and face the brink of bankruptcy whilst Tesla continues to grow volume production just as fast, or faster than the EV adoption grows at.\n\nThis partnership and many similar to it will allow Tesla to pay the lowest amount per kwH for their battery cells because they have generated long-term relationships with their providers and continuously focus on reducing the cost of the battery.\n\n[Share this article](https://theteslafolder.substack.com/p/how-tesla-has-conquered-ev-batteries?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo2NDkwODA3MiwicG9zdF9pZCI6NDgyMTg2NzAsImlhdCI6MTY0NDA5MjI2OCwiaXNzIjoicHViLTY0OTk4NSIsInN1YiI6InBvc3QtcmVhY3Rpb24ifQ.O4MgcoIHQipPS1QtqBicjVfwjROTXqyzwcyMh7CE1Mo)\n\nTLDR Key-Take-Aways\n\n🔋 “Tesla vehicle production is limited by total battery output.”“\n\n💰 Introduction of the 4680 cells could decrease cost of production by about $7,000\n\n📏 4680 cells could increase range by 24%\n\n✍ Partnership with Panasonic could secure batteries for an additional 400,000 vehicles\n\nThanks for taking the time to read guys I try to do this twice a week, thankyou for all the nice comments :)", "id": "sltvwk", "created_utc": 1644144160.0, "score": 194, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 69, "comments": [{"body": "Good analysis", "score": 25, "replies": [{"body": "Cheers mate!", "score": 12, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "It is a huge head start for us that other manufacturers aren’t designing vehicles with the 4680 yet, leaving the entire supply to Tesla for awhile", "score": 24, "replies": [{"body": "Every other manufacturer is anywhere from 3-8 years behind tesla.

But that's fine from a Tesla investor perspective, as long as 4680 could be the cheapest to manufacture by wide margin it would be revolutionary.\n\nNow that's was back then, things have happened.\n\n1. A lot of battery manufacturers followed Teslas lead after battery day and announced they would shift to 4680. The 4680 form factor can not be patented. How do their 4680 compare to Teslas 4680? Have they their own tabless design? We simply don't know. But reading from articles they all indicate that the battery manufacturers have developed their own 4680, it's not like Tesla have given their IP to a bunch of manufacturers and told them \"make this\". Panasonic, Samsung, LG and CATL are developing their own 4680 IP. Meaning there should be slight performance variance depending from which manufacturer. \n\n2. The notion that the cells will be up to 50% cheaper must be recalculated. Excluding Elons optimism it's probably closer to 30% cheaper. But it won't even be 30% cheaper because at the conference call we learned that Tesla learned it wasn't viable to produce LFP 4680 cells. With no LFP you can't really call 4680 revolutionary. There will only be 4680 nickel for premium cars and probably 10-20% cheaper per KWh.\n----------\n\nSo today it seems Tesla moved the industry to 4680. But what is to the benefit of Tesla? The only certain benefit I could tell is that Tesla would be the first to get their hands on 4680. Tesla would be the first to put 4680 in their cars 2022. And maybe 2023, but by 2024 we will definitely be having other cars with 4680.\n\nThere could be another benefit to Tesla and that's if Tesla could produce 4680 cheaper than it would to be to buy it from Panasonic or CATL.
