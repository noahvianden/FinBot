Unless you make 7.5% annualized on your puts after tax, CSPs are losing money.\n\nI would rather put up bond ETFs, stocks or gold ETF as collateral for margin.

I've been looking at asset correlation matrices for this.  In particular I sell a lot of TSLA puts and calls.\n\nI would intend to never get assigned on the naked puts or covered calls; would roll my way out.  This would preserve buying power and avoid interest on the put side.  On the call side, it would avoid selling stock and paying taxes on unrealized gains.  So this is the equivalent of long stock and moving around a short strangle, avoiding assignment.\n\nAnyone do this?

The law­suit even­tu­ally led to an un­usual agree­ment that Tesla lawyers would pre­clear some of the CEO’s tweets and other pub­lic state­ments.\n\n“The SEC seems to be tar­get­ing Mr. Musk and Tesla for un­re­lent­ing in­ves­ti­ga­tion largely be­cause Mr. Musk re­mains an out­spo­ken critic of the gov­ern­ment,” at­tor­ney Alex Spiro wrote in the let­ter to U.S. Dis­trict Judge Al­i­son Nathan in Man­hat­tan.\n\nMr. Musk landed in trouble in 2018 over a tweet that said he had “funding secured” to take Tesla private at $420 a share. The SEC alleged that Mr. Musk had never discussed such a going-private deal and that his statement, which caused Tesla’s stock to skyrocket, constituted fraud.\n\nMr. Musk and Tesla settled the SEC lawsuit by each agreeing to pay $20 million, and Mr. Musk stepped down as chairman in addition to agreeing to the Twitter", "id": "sv1pac", "created_utc": 1645138056.0, "score": 76, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 74, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|32|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|1797|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=sv1pac)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=sv1pac)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Best line in the article ‘The judge told the two sides to “put their reasonableness pants on” and find a way to settle the dispute.’", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "He would've been banned from Twitter by now if he didn't provide half its revenue", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "Lolol that is really true", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Is Elon being a whiny baby?
