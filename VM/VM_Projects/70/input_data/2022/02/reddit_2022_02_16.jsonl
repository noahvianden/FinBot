Some of the world's largest e-commerce brands have moved their entire websites over to Shopify. I work in software development.

Let me answer: building software is fucking expensive. A decent U.S.-based software engineer will set you back a minimum of $150k per year.

That millions of dollars the company is wiping its ass with every year. \n\nGuess who solves these problems? Shopify. Build it once, they maintain it for you.
