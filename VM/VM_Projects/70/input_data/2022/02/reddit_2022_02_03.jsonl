{"title": "Peculiar option behavior on AMZN Calls", "selftext": "First off, I am not looking for advice on trading options, but rather I am looking for some insight into why this option contract is behaving the way it is. I have never seen a contract act like this before.\n\nThe option I will use for an example here is \n\n   AMZN 2/11/22 3250c \n\nYesterday (2/2):  \n\n* This contract opened trading around $30. \n* AMZN stock price at open was around $3060. \n* The lowest dip in option value was around 11:20am when it went down around $20. \n* This coincided with AMZN's dropping about 2.5% to around $3000/share.\n\nFast forward to today:\n\n* Overnight AMZN dropped over 5% and \n* the corresponding AMZN 2/11/22 3250c dropped over 33% on the open. \n* Throughout today AMZN has slowly dropped 1.5% since the open (share price \\~$2850).\n*  YET the CALL option has been increasing all day and has gained 35% since opening!\n\nThe price of the AMZN 2/11/22 3250c contract right now (1:15pm) is \\~$22.50 and AMZN share price is \\~$2810. \n\nYESTERDAY the contract was less than that @ \\~$21.50, while the share price of AMZN was at $3000! So AMZN has lost over 6% since then yet my contract is worth MORE??\n\nWHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON???\n\nNot sure if you can tell but my knowledge of options is very limited, however I have enough experience to know that this is not normal. I assume it has to do with the volatility of the market right now coupled with AMZN earnings later today, but it just seems very counterintuitive to me.
