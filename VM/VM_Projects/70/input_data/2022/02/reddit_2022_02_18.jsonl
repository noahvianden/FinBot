Money velocity aggregates the Fed uses are simple sum aggragates that don't take into account liquidity. You can see here a screenshot of velocityof divisia M4 (https://i.imgur.com/axgvwu8.png) and read more about them here https://centerforfinancialstability.org/amfm_data.php\n\n Also the equation of money velocity is PQ/M with money supply being the denominator. As you increase money supply without the numerator increasing at the same rate velocity will continue to fall, this doesn't mean spending is declining but that money supply is increasing faster than GDP growth. This isn't really a problem because the reason for this rapid growth in money aggragates is the Fed swaping bonds which aren't included in money supply with bank reserves which are. This all increasing the aggragates, but the overall supply of money hasn't actually increased just the composite if certain assets.\n\nFinally the IOER has a role to play in this, in 2008 the Fed instituted the IOER which pays banks intrest on excess reserves, this policy is what allows the Fed to do QE without causing runaway inflation. See in a normal environment if the Fed makes the banking systems asset base more liquid they will rush to lend it out since cash or reseves is a liability to a bank, but with the IOER cash or in this case reserves is now an asset this incentives holding it. Now the Fed changes the IOER to a certain percentage to either make the banking system lend more or less depending on the state of the economy, this will decrease velocity because the turnover or money (reserves) is far lower.\n\nSo at the end of the day while money velocity was once a good measure to track consumer spending I don't really think it holds up in today's monetary environment with QE and new developments like the IOER, doesn't mean spending has or hasn't declined but velocity just not really a good messure to judge consumer spending anymore Imo.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Yes I  understand what you are saying but I am not fully there yet. If what you say were no doubt true, you would think that saving rates and consumer credit would reflect this. \n\nVelocity just measures how many times a each dollar is spent in a year (turnover rate) which is somewhat of an indicator of consumers willingness to consume.  Not really liquidity.\n\nPart of the utility of the ratio is just that, it is a ratio which can have several different implications just as you said.\n\nOne implication is that as velocity increases, inflation *may* increase. The increase in velocity is the expectations that consumers have that inflation will increase in the future so they advance their purchases. So it can be a positive feedback loop.\n\nMoney supply is a different matter. I think it is more complex that Friedman suggests.\n\nI think people are so used to the notion that when the Fed buys Treasury notes that it is a foregone conclusion that this will increase the money supply.  We know this isn't necessarily true however because of the Feds money \"sterilization\" activities.\n\nThey can do this by forex activities, selling govt bonds to name a couple of activities.\n\nHowever, there is an independent psychological effect called the \"liquidity effect\" which only comes into play with QE and *can* cause inflation and it certainly disrupts the primary function of the market which is price discovery.\n\nI will look over the links you posted and see if I can find some more info on this. There is a lot of movement in Eco right now.   The Phillips curve wars that suggest that the Phillips curve is actually only present in fixed exchange rate regimes, not flexible.

We know this isn't necessarily true however because of the Feds money \"sterilization\" activities\"\n\nI dont really see how it wouldn't, the Fed Is reducing the number of bonds banks hold and remeber bonds aren't included in any money aggragate with reserves which are included indirectly or directly in every money aggragate which is why QE would naturally increase the aggragates but wouldn't necessarily increase the actual ammount of money since your swaping somthing that wasn't messure with somthing that is messured.\n\n\n\"However, there is an independent psychological effect called the \"liquidity effect\" which only comes into play with QE and can cause inflation and it certainly disrupts the primary function of the market which is price discovery\"\n\nLiquidity effect if I'm not mistaken was Milton Friedmans term but I don't belive it is psychological however, QE really does make the banking systems asset base more liquid or to put it another way, banks need reserves in order to make loans, by exchanging reserves for bonds the Fed can enable banks to make more loans, they also use the IOER to make sure there isn't a mad dash to get rid of these reserves. This isn't as psychological as practical as banks really can create more crefit than before.

{"title": "“Stock market faces the most ‘massive misallocation’ of ‘capital in the history of mankind,’ ARK’s Cathie Wood” — 2/17 MarketWatch Article", "selftext": "**Article Link: https://archive.today/BXYwK**\n\n#Stock market faces the most ‘massive misallocation’ of ‘capital in the history of mankind,’ says ARK’s Cathie Wood\n\n*Published: Feb. 17, 2022 at 1:51 p.m. ET\nBy Mark DeCambre*\n\n> Cathie Wood, the star fund manager and chief executive of ARK Invest, took to CNBC to defend the woeful performance of the manager’s suite of disruptive innovation funds.\n\n> Wood told the business network in a Thursday interview that the gravitation of money managers toward benchmarks, rather than taking risk on what she views as potentially game-changing technology in gene editing, electric vehicles and artificial intelligence, among others, was creating a “massive misallocation of capital” in markets that could be the biggest in “the history of mankind.”\n“Benchmarks are where they are because of past successes…If we are right, those are the companies that will be disrupted,” she said on CNBC.  \n\n> She said “absolutely,” when asked if some of the companies her funds have invested in, which enjoyed nearly parabolic run-ups during the height of the pandemic-fueled worries in 2020, would return to their pandemic heights.\n\n> So far in 2022, each of the flagship ARK Innovation’s ARKK, -5.63% 40 holdings had fallen more than 10%. The fund itself has slumped 26% year to date, and lost more than half its value over the past 12 months, FactSet data show:\n\n**[SEE CHART: https://archive.today/BXYwK]**\n\n> By comparison, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -1.49% was down 5% in the year to date, the S&P 500 index SPX, -1.74% was trading 7.4% over the same period, the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -2.30% has declined by 11.5% and the large-capitalization Nasdaq-100 index NDX, -2.30% was off 12.4%, as of Thursday afternoon.\n\n> Wood said the shares of all of the companies that ARK has bought in its various funds would return to lofty heights and trade well beyond their pandemic tops, including investments in companies such as Roblox Corp. RBLX, 0.85%, Teladoc Health TDOC, -3.38% and Zoom Video Communications ZM, -5.75%.\n\n> “We are not going back to the old ways of doing things,” she said about the surge in value in the cache of stocks bought by ARK that saw revenue accelerate during the COVID public health crisis.\nShe also made the case that mature growth companies, including those considered in the FAANG category, such as Meta Platforms FB, -2.71% (formerly known as Facebook Inc.), Apple Inc. AAPL, -1.82%, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -1.17%, Netflix NFLX, -1.97% and Google-parent Alphabet GOOG, -2.70% GOOGL, -2.85%, would face bigger challenges, if interest rates rise and inflation pressures persist, than her disruptive innovative investments.\n\n> “The companies that are going to be hurt most by inflation and interest rates—if they are going to be a problem—are those that are in the mature growth category,” she said.\n\n> She reiterated that investors in ARK need to maintain a 5-year time horizon to eventually reap investment rewards.\n\n> “If we are right and the growth rate [is]15% on an annualized rate over the next five years, interest rates and inflation are not going to be a problem for,” ARK’s investments, she said.\n\n> To those who are betting on the failure of ARK, Wood said the idea of shorting innovation is “ridiculous,” referencing funds, including Tuttle Capital Short Innovation ETF SARK, 5.69%, which can be used to wager against ARK’s roster of investments.\n\n> “The idea of shorting innovation in America is ridiculous, I think,” she said.\n\n> “The pendulum has swung…and if we are right, the rewards are going to be enormous,” she said. (It is worth noting that Matthew Tuttle, CEO of Tuttle Capital, has said that his fund is geared toward those who want to take the other side of Wood’s bets as well those who are simply looking to protect against losses on such investments.)\n\n> Meanwhile, Wood also said that more than half of her personal net worth was tied up in ARK and its funds and that she feels the pain of investors who are suffering through current declines.", "id": "sva936", "created_utc": 1645162920.0, "score": 36, "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "num_comments": 79, "comments": [{"body": "“i’m not wrong, the market is”", "score": 83, "replies": [{"body": "No, it’s the children who are wrong.", "score": 17, "replies": []}, {"body": "Exactly what I thought lmao.", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "She would know, she's the one misallocating it lmao", "score": 75, "replies": []}, {"body": "Everything else is overvalued except my bag.
