Additionally we have the greatest yield curve inversion since 40 years. I‚Äôm convinced this recession will be very bad. And the FED will love every minute of it. \n\nThe FED will drive the US economy off a cliff before the thought of pivoting even crosses their mind. They will certainly break something (unemployment sky high, liquidity crunch in the treasury markets, etc) which will lead them to pivoting. If you still have cash and the ability to invest, that is when you dump everything you have into the markets, get a second mortgage, get margin etc because the market will soar and make the previous bull run look like a spec on the charts.
