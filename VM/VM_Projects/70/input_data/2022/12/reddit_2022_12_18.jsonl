{"title": "Forget inflation, start following the job market", "selftext": "Last week we received the most \"encouraging\" consumer price index we have received in recent times, when the price index rose at a lower rate than expected and is in line with the target of the Federal Bank\\*.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere is an asterisk at the end of the last sentence, to emphasize that one month is not enough to determine a trend.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNor did the markets react in the euphoric way that the Wall Street bulls had hoped.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe problem is that the market already sees that the peak of inflation is behind it, but the difficulty will be to maintain the slowing trend, especially in the more sticky areas of the price index.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe resulting inflation has three main factors that affect the Personal Expenditure Index (PCE) that the Fed is particularly fond of.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe first is commodity inflation, which was caused thanks to problems in the supply chain and increased demand during the Corona period. It can be said that commodity inflation is behind us as commodity prices have returned to lower levels, shipping prices have dropped almost to pre-pandemic levels and supply has almost balanced with demand. Raw material prices currently do not provide fuel for inflation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe second is housing inflation. Unlike the State of Israel, in the USA housing expenses affect the index, and a lot. The zero interest rates pushed many investors to try their luck in high-leverage real estate investments, which pushed prices up. With the rise in prices and the rise in interest rates, housing expenses increased for those investors (and not only investors) but now the trend is changing. Real estate prices in the US have started to fall and it is also possible to find the buds of an exploding bubble when there are mortgages larger than the price of the apartment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe third, and the most problematic is the service inflation. For those who do not know, this inflation is expressed in wages for the various service providers, such as in the field of health, leisure, education, restaurants, haircuts and more. The problem for the Fed (and the service industry in general) is that the demand for workers is far greater than the supply. This creates a situation that motivates employers to pay more for each employee. According to the Fed, there are about 1.7 job vacancies for every person looking for a job.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Fed can suppress the first two factors through the interest rate, i.e. reducing the cheap money that suppresses demand. But service inflation is different. This is a difficult inflation issue, which to solve it requires a crisis, a recession if you will.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe ironic situation is that the market thinks that a recession can be avoided because the employment market is strong, but the situation has begun to seep through to the decision makers at the Fed, and will eventually be understood by the markets as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThose who followed the latest interest rate decision could hear Powell refer directly to the situation, when he mentioned service inflation and said it was the main reason for the continued rise in interest rates.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter the quiet period of Fed speakers, which takes place before interest rate decisions, some of the members returned to the speech and they returned and sharpened the message: unemployment must rise (to the 4.5% range) to beat inflation. That is, it is not enough to create new jobs, but the policy makers want to see an increase in unemployment of at least half a percent! By the way, there has never been an increase in unemployment of half a percent without a recession.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor this to happen, the Fed will continue to raise and keep interest rates high, even at the cost of a recession. The latest PMI/ISM purchasing managers' index data reflect a contraction of the economy, and the main reason that GDP is still positive is the increased export of energy raw materials (gas, oil, coal) from the US to Europe and defense spending to Ukraine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRight now the market doesn't believe the Fed, and says the Fed will fold before the economy goes into recession. Judging by the latest figures, it may already be too late.", "id": "zoxoa5", "created_utc": 1671366962.0, "score": 158, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 76, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|0|**First Seen In WSB**|2 years ago\n**Total Comments**|7|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\n ^^[**Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse) ^^[BanBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/banbets/)  ^^VoteBot ^^[FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/votebot/) ^^[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/leaderboard/) ^^- ^^[**Keep_VM_Alive**](https://www.patreon.com/visualmod)\n>TL;DR:", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Penis.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Solid", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Thanks I was lost in the wall of text until this explanation.
