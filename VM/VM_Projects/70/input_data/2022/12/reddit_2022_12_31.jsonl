{"title": "Tesla Megapack GIGATHREAD - pricing, profits, misconceptions", "selftext": "Hey guys, so lately there has been much discussion and speculation here and on Twitter regarding Tesla Megapack pricing, profitibality, tax credit eligibility, and deliveries for 2023.\n\nSo i did a little (alot) of digging and to no surprise found that much of what is being disseminated and repeated is mostly bullshit.\n\nIt seems alot of people, including some prominent fans with very large followings, have no idea what they're talking about and are spreading speculative rubbish all over the internet.\n\nThis is an example of the kind of posts i've been seeing (no offense to the user):\n\n\"*people are the doing math on 25 megapacks/day capacity of the Lathrop factory at a 30-50% profit margin. $30M/day profit x 350 days/yr is a cool $10B/yr operating profit which thanks to the IRA's $45/kWh credit (if Tesla can find qualifying materials suppliers) would be roughly tax-free. $10B is roughly $3/share so at a 25 P/E multiple Lathrop alone would push the shares back to $200.*\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo here are some facts and what i've learned the last couple of days.\n\n1. **Tesla delivered 5GWh storage in the TTM.** This may increase to 6 or 7 GWh if Tesla delivers 2Gwh or more in Q4.\n2. Elon said on Q3 call: **\"Tesla energy will grow by 150-200%/year.\"** This implies 12.5-15GWh production in 2023 at 5GWh ttm, or up to 15-18GWh at 6Gwh TTM, and as high as 17-21GWh if Tesla does 7Gwh in 2022.\n3. We know **the megapack factory can do 40GWh, or 10,000 MP fully ramped**.\n4. **MP prices are \\~$2.4m/single unit and closer to $2m/unit** for orders of 5 or more.\n5. At **15GWh of Megapacks is equivelant to 3,750 Megapacks**. \\*Remember Tesla Energy includes Powerwall. If Tesla delivers between 15-18GWh of Energy Storage in 2023, some % of ethat will be in the form of Powerwall. I don't think there's any official source for the Pwerwall/MP split, but based on TTM energy storage deliveries i imagine Powerwall accounts for less than 4GWh of the 5GWh TTM. I don't expect Powerwall to scale as quickly as Megapack, if at all.\n6. **3,750 Megapacks at an average of $2m is $7.5b** in revenues - not all of which is incremental over 2022!\n7. **Incremental YoY revenues from megapacks**, under this calculation, **are just 9GWh or $4.5b** in revenues. **At 30-50% margin this would be $1.35b-$2.25b in profits, or $0.42-$0.71 in EPS.**\n8. **There are unconfirmed rumors that Megapack could have 60% profit margins.** These rumors started because someone found an embedded reference in the Megapack web page which cited 60% margins. Some people are attributing this to the switch to LFP cells which supposedly happened in Sept of 2022.\n9. **In September of 2022, Tesla increased the size of Megapack energy capacity from 2.6MWh to 3.9MWh, a roughly 50% increase**. At the same time, **the physical footprint of the Megapack increased by 6 feet in length, and 64% in weight**. Using these calculations someone realized **the new Megapacks had a lower energy density** than the older version, thus fueling speculation that they switched to using LFP cells versus NMC cells. **Additionally, Tesla increased the price of Megapack from $1.5m/unit to $2.4m/unit, or 60%.**\n10. Elon Musk disclosed in early 2021 that the business intends to use cobalt-free LFP batteries in its stationary energy storage devices. He emphasized that the cathode is the bulk and expense of the cell.\n11. The LFP cells are likely to be manufactured by CATL. In China, the price of LFP cathode active material (CAM) from CATL *is 43% less expensive, (per kWh*), than their NMC811 material.\n12. CATL, the world’s biggest maker of batteries for electric vehicles, has been considering locations in Mexico and the U.S. to supply cells to automakers including Ford and Tesla Inc.\n13. **Each Megapack comes with a 15 year maintenance agreement.** The cost of the maintenance agreement is $8,200 for one unit and as low as $4,800/unit for contracts of 100 units or more. **At an average maintenance agreement price of $5,000/unit,** t**his represents \\~$50m in recurring annual revenue for every 10,000 Megapacks deployed!** Thanks to u/Yoddle for pointing this out!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, that covers 2023 deliveries growth, revenues, and potential profits. Hopefully that also explains the sources of these rumors. You can adjust the numbers as you see fit if you want to estimate various impacts on EPS at various breakpoints.\n\n**But keep in mind, these numbers will grow again by as much as 150-200% in 2024, when i estimate Tesla will reach maximum production of 40GWh from the current factory.**\n\n**But what about the tax credits from the 2023 Inflation reduction act?**\n\nThis  is the best understanding to my knowledge of the credits. **I may be wrong about the interpretation of the text**, application and eligibility criteria for tax credits, etc. If anyone knows better or is better able to decipher the text than i was, **please feel free to correct me.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. There are essentially two types of tax credits. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) and Investment Tax Credit (ITC).\n2. **PTCs are for producers** of goods or services, such as manufacturers of battery cells, or solar/wind energy farms selling electricity to the grid. What qualifies and doesn't is very specific.\n3. **ITCs are for consumers**, this includes ordinary people who buy Powerwalls or EVs and  businesses such as utility companies buying stationary storage.\n4. **Tax Credits are not \"free money\" given by the government to consumers. They're credits which people and businesses can use against any taxes they owe.** If you don't owe taxes, you wont benefit from tax credits. The government isn't giving money away, it's simply collecting less. In most instances any unused tax credits can be carried forward by persons and businesses for 10 years. In some instances tax credits can be \"transferred\" or sold to other businsses.\n5. Standalone Battery Storage qualifies for ITC. This is new and didn't previously exist in 2022. This means **anyone buying Megapacks from Tesla will be eligible for ITCs equal to 30-40% of the price.**\n6. **As far as i know, there are no PTC or ITC that would apply to Tesla as a manufacturer of Megapacks** since they're really just assembling various components into a final product, rather than manufacturing the individual components themselves.\n7. There are tax credits for manufacturing batter cells and modules. These are $35/KWh for batteries, and $10/KWh for modules ($45 if modules don't use cells).\n8. If Tesla is buying LFP cells from CATL, and assembling them into modules then Megapacks they should qualify for the $10/KWh credit. This would be equivelant to $39,000 in credits for each 3.9MWh Megapack (which is not enough to significantly reduce taxes or increase eps tbh). But if Tesla is simply assembling modules from CATL into its Megapacks it is very likely Tesla will receive nothing.\n9. **If Tesla wants to capture some of the ITCs from customers, it could potentially raise Megapack prices by an equivelant amount.** However, from Tesla's site we know Megapack is sold out for the next 2 years. This means they have 2 years worth of orders allready on the books. We don't know if the order prices are fixed, or flexible.\n10. **The problem with raising prices to capture ITCs is it only works if Megapack customers have sufficient taxable income such that they can offset the increase in prices with the tax credits.** If  a business doesn't have enough profits to to take full advantage of the credits this strategy might not work.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA couple closing thoughts:\n\nThe IRA also created a 15% Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax. This tax only applies to businesses with more than $1b income average over the last 3 years, which should qualify Tesla.\n\nWhile Tesla has historically paid less than 15% in taxes, this change isn't as bad as it seems. The 15% minimum tax can be reduced to less than 15% through depreciation expenses and tax credits, including the aforementioned (i believe) the ITCs and PTCs.\n\nThere was a change included in this bill which allows companies to use an accelerated depreciation schedule, specifically designed to incentivize industrial manufacturers and companies with large equipment capital costs. I believe this has the potential to greatly benefit Tesla in the short and long-term, and will probably allow Tesla to continue paying less than 15% in taxes on income going forward.\n\nI believe Tesla's partnership with Panasonic in Nevada will benefit from PTCs. And per the terms of  the agreement in the contract Panasonic signed with Tesla, it says under section 4.6:  \"*Credits; Customs.  Credits or benefits related to taxes and export/import duties resulting from the Contract, including trade credits, export credits or the rights to the refund of duties, taxes, or fees, belong to Tesla unless otherwise prohibited by applicable law.*\" I'm not well versed in legalese, but unless the IRA prohibits this, i believe Tesla is entitled to all and any PTC credits generated at giga Nevada from the manufacture of battery cells by Panasonic. Thank you u/Yoddle for the source!\n\nSo Tesla may yet benefit from IRA PTCs for battery and module manufacturing which is currently estimated to be around 35 GWh in Nevada. **Assuming Tesla receives 100% of credits, and receives the full $45/KWh for both battery + pack assembly, that would be $1.575b in tax credits** \\- enough to entirely offset all of the taxes Tesla paid over the trailing twelve months with extra left over. \n\nPanasonic also has plans to build another $4b batter factory in Kansas. Construction should have started in Novemeber, and estimates are it will begin production in 2025. Initial production capacity is 30GWh. Panasonic is also rumored to be looking at Oklahoma for another battery factory to supply Tesla.\n\nAdditionally, **Tesla is in the process of ramping production of its 4680 battery cells to 40GWh which could unlock another $1.575b once fully ramped.** And if that wasn't enough, Tesla will undoubtedly also benefit from PTCs of 10% the manufacturing cost for production of battery cathode material from the factory currently under construction in Austin, which will go into the 4680 cells.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo that's about everything covering the research i've done and what i've learned on Megapack and Tax Credits which hopefully corrects many of the misconceptions currently floating about the internet.\n\nHope this is useful to you all, and Happy New Year! May this one be better to Tesla investors than the last.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nsources:\n\nTax Credits: [https://www.mossadams.com/articles/2022/08/inflation-reduction-act-clean-energy-credits#section-45](https://www.mossadams.com/articles/2022/08/inflation-reduction-act-clean-energy-credits#section-45)\n\nMegapack price changes: [https://www.cleanfuture.co.in/2022/08/18/tesla-lfp-battery-megapack/#:\\~:text=Tesla%20Will%20Use%20LFP%20Batteries,storage%20systems%20on%20the%20market](https://www.cleanfuture.co.in/2022/08/18/tesla-lfp-battery-megapack/#:~:text=Tesla%20Will%20Use%20LFP%20Batteries,storage%20systems%20on%20the%20market).\n\n[https://electrek.co/2022/09/14/tesla-megapack-update-specs-price/](https://electrek.co/2022/09/14/tesla-megapack-update-specs-price/)\n\nMegapack maintenance agreement - [https://tesla-cdn.thron.com/static/TX9EDA\\_210714\\_Megapack\\_Web\\_Maintenance\\_Agreement\\_\\_Clean\\_vF\\_EBL8HO.pdf?xseo=&response-content-disposition=inline%3Bfilename%3D%22megapack-web-maintenance-agreement.pdf%22](https://tesla-cdn.thron.com/static/TX9EDA_210714_Megapack_Web_Maintenance_Agreement__Clean_vF_EBL8HO.pdf?xseo=&response-content-disposition=inline%3Bfilename%3D%22megapack-web-maintenance-agreement.pdf%22)\n\nLFP/LMC costs: [**https://nickelinstitute.org/blog/2020/june/battle-of-the-batteries-cost-versus-performance/**](https://nickelinstitute.org/blog/2020/june/battle-of-the-batteries-cost-versus-performance/)\n\nElon's direct quote: [https://www.tesmanian.com/blogs/tesmanian-blog/tesla-has-released-a-new-megapack-xl-with-lfp-batteries-50-more-powerful-than-the-previous-one](https://www.tesmanian.com/blogs/tesmanian-blog/tesla-has-released-a-new-megapack-xl-with-lfp-batteries-50-more-powerful-than-the-previous-one)\n\nCATL factory: [https://www.autonews.com/automakers-suppliers/ford-chinas-catl-mull-us-battery-plant](https://www.autonews.com/automakers-suppliers/ford-chinas-catl-mull-us-battery-plant)\n\nGiga Nevada output: [https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-giga-nevada-improve-battery-production-10-percent-report/](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-giga-nevada-improve-battery-production-10-percent-report/)\n\nGiga Nevada Panasonic contract terms: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000156459020033670/tsla-ex102\\_486.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000156459020033670/tsla-ex102_486.htm)\n\nPanasonic Kansas factory: [https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2022/10/31/business/corporate-business/panasonic-kansas-battery-plant/#:\\~:text=Japan's%20Panasonic%20Holdings%20said%20on,growing%20market%20for%20electric%20vehicles](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2022/10/31/business/corporate-business/panasonic-kansas-battery-plant/#:~:text=Japan's%20Panasonic%20Holdings%20said%20on,growing%20market%20for%20electric%20vehicles)\n\nPanasonic Oklahoma: [https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/26/panasonic-considers-oklahoma-for-next-ev-battery-factory/?guccounter=1&guce\\_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce\\_referrer\\_sig=AQAAAEV90OtuHy5oVXBIo00vWjeUYmQKi6NAQegTiLw3pf0WWlsVFhqBjTKNR\\_s2N4f4gu37iloa8wgxODP4YxBaENuch1lFwNU7WBPkRxC8eFHnKUQc3DTRh21Y9kuu1mt4fQNInOJY5t35R\\_RSdd3MT5HtMJLqtNhafwJ3UXqZCrww](https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/26/panasonic-considers-oklahoma-for-next-ev-battery-factory/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAEV90OtuHy5oVXBIo00vWjeUYmQKi6NAQegTiLw3pf0WWlsVFhqBjTKNR_s2N4f4gu37iloa8wgxODP4YxBaENuch1lFwNU7WBPkRxC8eFHnKUQc3DTRh21Y9kuu1mt4fQNInOJY5t35R_RSdd3MT5HtMJLqtNhafwJ3UXqZCrww)", "id": "10025b8", "created_utc": 1672516350.0, "score": 188, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 83, "comments": [{"body": "Great job and references!

It's a low margin product since competitors do what Tesla does without that much effort. \n\nThe megapacks might be higher margin.   \nA potential blow to the margin is the lifetime of the megapacks compared to the lifetime of e.g. a peaker plant.    \n   \nTo say that the margin \\*must\\* be high, is wishful thinking. \n\nUsing up an expensive battery to arbitrage a quit low electric price difference is not an inherently high margin activity.

Tesla is supposedly #2.\n\nBut if you go the Fluence's website, they advertise having deployed 5.5GWh of battery storage as a huge accomplishment. I'm not sure if that's 5.5GWh in 2022, or lifetime - but Tesla did 5GWh in the last 12 months.\n\nFurthermore, Fluence predicts the market demand (or as they call it \"opportunities\") will be 17GWh in 2030...which is comical seeing as according to my estimates and Elon's comments, Tesla has a backlog of 40-50GWh and will sell that much alone next year!\n\nSo, based on my brief google search i think it's safe to say Tesla will be the #1 provider of battery storage solutions next year, if it isn't already.\n\nI really think analysts and investors are sleeping on the significance of the energy business but i think 2023 will be an abrupt wake up call.\n\nMight make a more detailed post about competition, an addendum to the current one, if you will.

Is this something that could substantially cap the growth of Tesla (and the whole EV and energy storage industries)? I have a holding in a cool lithium production co on the Australian stock exchange (asx: AGY, if anyone cares), and, from my interactions in that community, it seems like increased lithium production in a meaningful way will take a LONG time to ramp up. Do y’all feel like this is a legitimate medium term risk??", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I honestly don't know. I haven't done any recent research on lithium industry specifically, but i think Tesla is well aware of its needs and they are probably the best prepared.\n\nYoutuber TheLimitingFactor has been an excellent resource in the past. I'va watched most of his videos and he does a great job discussing all aspects of Tesla's batteries and the associated supply chain. If you look at some older videos i know there are some that cover this topic.\n\nAlso, Tesla is well aware of their needs and the rate at which the industry is growing. On battery day they made it clear, that if they need to, they will get involved in directly mining for lithium - and they bought a large amount of land for this purpose, just in case. Recommend watching the battery day video.\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla is building a battery cathode factory on the Giga Austin Campus.  There's a video by Joe Tegtmeyer of Giga Texas by drone in the below article from Electrek where you can see the building's progress in Aug. Joe makes almost daily videos so if you want to keep an eye on it give him a follow.\n\nI believe this factory will provide the cathode material for Tesla's 4680 cells, but i'm not entirely sure - it might also be capable of making the cathode material for the 2170 cells that are manufactured at Giga Nevada by Panasonic.\n\n[https://electrek.co/2022/08/30/tesla-first-battery-cathode-factory-progress-update/](https://electrek.co/2022/08/30/tesla-first-battery-cathode-factory-progress-update/)\n\nAdditionally, Tesla has been planning a lithium hydroxide refining plant in Texas, off the Gulf Coast. I haven't seen any confirmations but rumors were that construction would start in November 2022.\n\nHere are some news articles covering that progress and developments:\n\n[https://www.mining-technology.com/news/tesla-lithium-refinery-us/](https://www.mining-technology.com/news/tesla-lithium-refinery-us/)\n\n[https://electrek.co/2022/11/17/tesla-lithium-refinery-project-texas/#:\\~:text=Tesla%20is%20currently%20working%20on,the%20Gulf%20Coast%20of%20Texas](https://electrek.co/2022/11/17/tesla-lithium-refinery-project-texas/#:~:text=Tesla%20is%20currently%20working%20on,the%20Gulf%20Coast%20of%20Texas).\n\n[https://www.mining.com/web/tesla-confirms-plans-to-build-lithium-refinery-in-texas%EF%BF%BC/](https://www.mining.com/web/tesla-confirms-plans-to-build-lithium-refinery-in-texas%EF%BF%BC/)\n\nAlso, lithium refining may be a bigger bottleneck right now than the rough material. So this may be more significant than it seems. That's because the current supply chain sees about 60% of lithium refining done in China.\n\nBy building a lithium refining plant in the US, Tesla will be able to simplify the supply chain immensely this way. Instead of  exporting lithium mined in the US/Canada to China, where it's refined, and then shipped back to the US, where it's used in batteries - Tesla will do the refining in the US, then send the refined lithium to its various factories in the U.S. / Europe.\n\nBy doing this Tesla is further vertically integrating the supply chain which will increase profit margins. It also shortens the supply chain which reduces the time it takes to get lithium from mine to car. Tesla will probably also benefit from various tax credits related to critical minerals manufacturing in the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nHere's an article on that: [https://www.mangrovelithium.com/localized-lithium-refining/#:\\~:text=Despite%20being%20such%20an%20important,much%2Dneeded%20battery%20tech%20innovation](https://www.mangrovelithium.com/localized-lithium-refining/#:~:text=Despite%20being%20such%20an%20important,much%2Dneeded%20battery%20tech%20innovation)\n\nSo, while i do think Lithium could be a long term problem in general for the industry... i think Tesla will probably be the best prepared automaker to navigate any challenges in the future.\n\nAnd in the short-term, Tesla has been saying that battery supply is no longer constrained so i'm confident they have secured enough lithium supply to grow  well into the future. Also encouraging is the fact that lithium prices appear to be declining from their peak recently which should relieve some price pressure on the battery side of things.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you for sharing your knowledge and insight. \n\nThe additional sources and thorough response are most appreciated!", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "Who are the other big players in grid level energy storage?

My opinion is the bulk of this will be from Megapack. I think they're currently around 2-3GWh/year of Powerwall installations. I think they could  deploy as much as 2.5GWh storage in Q4 2022 alone, which would be around 6.5GWh for 2022. \n\n150%-200% YoY growth on 6.5GWh would be 16-19.5GWh in 2023. Maybe 3-5GWh is Powerwall, and the rest is Megapack. If they do another 150-200% YoY growth in 2024 they should be around 40-45GWh, which would be maximum production for the Megapack factory + 4-5GWh of Powerwall. \n\nOf course my above math is based on my Q4 estimate which itself is a guessed based off of the growth of storage over last 2 Qs and assuming the ramp is exponential. It's possible Tesla delivers just 2GWh in Q4, or less, but they might be able to do 3GWh too.\n\n>Is another factory possible?\n\nI think it's inevitable. The Lathrop Megapack factory groundbreaking ceremony was held in September 2021. If you look into the quarterly earnings slides you'll see the language on Energy shifted from \"factory under construction\" in Q4 2021, to \"production ramping\" in Q1, Q2, and Q3 of 2022. I think deliveries form this factory started in Q2, but it's hard to say with any certainty.\n\nAnyway, the point is Megapack factories seem relatively quick and easy to build - 12 months, maybe less, from beginning to production. So, to keep growing this business Tesla will could start building new factories around Q42023 or Q1 2024. If i had to guess the next factory will be even bigger and better. I imagine Tesla plans to have one or more factories on every continent. Masterplan Part 3 will probably address this - how to scale Megapack production into the hundreds of GWh or potentially TWhs.\n\n>Do we know what the profit on maintenance contracts is?\n\nCouldn't tell you. Not an electrical engineer, never worked in any related field. Not sure what kind of maintenance needs to be done. Obviously someone has to do it, so some of the cost will cover the salaries of those employees whos jobs it is to do that. Not sure if companies would be billed seperately in case anything needed to be replaced. Lots of unknowns. But at $5,000/year/unit average for 15years... margins from this could actually be quite high. Assuming 10,000 Powerwalls (1 year of 40GWh production) that's $50m/year of recurring revenue. That's not nothing, but even if margins on maintenance are 90%... it's small potatoes compared to the billions they're making from selling cars. Still you can imagine in 10+ years when there are potentially 100k-200k+ Megapacks deployed globally... the revenues are likely to exceed $1b. But again, that pales in comparison to the profits from the rest of Tesla's businesses.\n\n>Does this exclude power wall? If yes, can we get same detail for power wall?\n\nDoes what exclude Powerwall? My understanding is that Powerwall could be as much as 2-3GWh of the 5GWh that were delivered in the last 12 months. It could also be less. It's hard to parse this out, but there are some clues in the slide decks and associated comments. For example, in the Q3 2021 report they actually say that Megapack deployments counted for 3GWh of the TTM deployments which were very close to 5GWh. This implies they were producing at least 2GWh/year of Powerwall at the end of 2021.\n\nBut Storage deployments suddenly dipped in Q4 2021, and slightly again in Q1 2022. In Q1 2022 Tesla deployed 845 MWh of Storage versus 445 MWh in Q1 2021. In the comments Tesla then says most of the 90% YoY growth in the quarter was driven by Powerwall deployments. Then in April 2022, Tesla stopped selling Powerwalls indepedently and since then you can only buy Powerwalls bundled with Solar. This was kind of a strange move considering how popular the Powerwall was. Tesla even raised prices multiple times because Powerwall demand was higher than production.\n\nOn the other hand Tesla may have been battery starved at the time and the same batteries that go into the Powerwall are also used in their cars (2170 i believe). So this may have been a way for them to shift cells to the car side of the business. Also, Powerwall was never very profitable.\n\nEventually, I wouldn't be surprised if Tesla releases a new Powerwall version utilizing LFP cells - i think that would make sense considering they're doing it with Megapack.\n\n>Are the roof solar tiles dead?\n\nNot that i'm aware of. I think scaling the production and  installation of solar roof, finding contractors, training them and setting up all the associated logistics is just more difficult and complicated than they first thought. The rollout/ramp is undoubtedly going slower than expected but you can still order one from their website. And they're still iterating on design.

In fact Tesla's cars have better margins so...\n\nAnyway, nothing is stopping Tesla from eventually getting into LFP production. Although   there were patents which prevented LFP manufacturing outside of China - those expired in 2022. Expect to see alot of new entrants, especially in the US, which will increase competition and lower costs long-term. Current profit margins for LFP batteries are like 20-25%, so alot of room for that to come down as the monopoly China once had is undone. Alot of money to be saved too by domesticating the supply chain.\n\nPlus 20-25% of a 3.9MWh pack which contains $4-500k in LFP, is $80-100k difference. If Tesla needed to compete, they can drop prices by $80-100k and eat the margin difference. But, there's no reason to enter into this kind of price war because BESS customers can tolerate the high/current prices since the return on investment for these systems is so quick. Remember, for the time being BESS isn't competing with other BESS, it's really competing with Nat Gas/Coal. All BESS providers need to do is price their BESS just under the cost of Coal/Gas equivelant systems and they will sell. Once the bESS market is saturate, then the price wars will begin - but that might be a while.\n\nSee: [https://www.solarpowerworldonline.com/2022/03/new-lfp-battery-maker-plans-to-establish-gigafactory-in-united-states/](https://www.solarpowerworldonline.com/2022/03/new-lfp-battery-maker-plans-to-establish-gigafactory-in-united-states/)\n\nAlso, CATL and Tesla are serving different markets. Tesla currently has a big advantage in the US thanks to the IRA tax credits which reduces the cost by 30-50% for the buyer. CATL doesn't assemble their EnerC systems in the US so it can't get these credits. This gives Tesla a huge price advantage in the US which is where i expect they will sell most of their product in the coming years.\n\nLast thing, if what you said is true... how was Tesla able to sell any BESS at all so far?
