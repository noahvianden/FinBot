(I want to say 15\" or 17\" but I could be mistaken on the exact suze.) The problem was that no one could make them yet. So he tells them that he puts a team of people on looking for *another* company to make it. It takes them months to get someone to do it. They could have went with one 2 or 3 inches smaller and it would have been ready to manufacture right then. \n\nThis really stuck with me because:\n\n1. It's not your innovation, you literally just dumped what was likely 6+ figures on begging people to make it for you.\n\n2.its such an unnecessary feature that you could have saved so much money on if you just went with what ever the biggest available was.\n\nThey didn't even have the car working at this point. It really opened my eyes to the skewed priorities.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "I think you actually just made a case for his vision. The screen is a huge standout factor for the cars and entirely separate from their battery and motor tech which is still industry leading.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "No, he could have had one twice as big as any other at the time and still not had to have wasted high 6 figures to get it. And guess what? You can now get much larger than he has in a Tesla and for cheap. If he had a Tesla running at the time then okay, worry about extras. But at the time they literally (by his own admission) put their body on a separate company's car to try to make it look like they were farther along than they were.\n\nAnd we see this all the time with him, he went through millions in R&D to make it so you could swap batteries out in a Tesla only to never have it come to fruition because he realized that we are decades from the infrastructure for that to be feasible.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "I dont get why you keep bringing up 6 figure screen that in fact did innovate the car market as all new evs have a central huge screen in contrast to its billions in revenue. Also the r&d to discover that the batteries are not feasible is just good r&d. im not getting your examples you‚Äôre picking, and im absolutely not an elon fan. Maybe his insistence on automating the assembly process even though more human integration objectively sped up and increased volume.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "The issue with the screen is he spent an insane amount of money, not to develop it, but to find someone else to do it. And there was a perfectly good option right there that would have still been over twice as large as any others at the time. He still would have set the trend with those.  And  **again** he didn't even have a functional car. Not even a functional motor at the time. On top of that it wad in an industry that would have developed a larger screen any ways. I can get a 24 inch touch screen at best buy for less than $100 now. He could have easily just kept putting in the largest available at the time. If you can't see why that's dumb then I'm not sure what else to say.\n\nThe battery issue is dumb because anyone should have seen the issue. Having enough charging stations even now is a bit of an issue. Manageable, but not fantastic. Bow imagine what you need to swap out a 1300 lbs battery. Because let me be clear, his vision was not to swap it out when you needed a new one. He thought he would be able to make enough places to be able to pull up and get a new battery rather than charge it. Imagine the storage space needed to even hold 10 batteries at a time. Plus the space to be able to swap those out. And this was nearly 10 years ago when there were far less charging stations. All of this to save people 20 minutes on charging.\n\n\nThe issue is for every successful \"Musk is obsessed with something\" like the screen, we also get a disaster like the boring company.
