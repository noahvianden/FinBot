{"title": "Cathie Wood of ARK Invest bought 74,862 shares of Tesla today worth around around $11.7 million", "selftext": "Elon Musk fan Cathie Wood seized a sizable chunk of Tesla stock (TSLA) late Wednesday after the stock extended a recent skid to its lowest level in more than two years.\n\nARK Invest, Wood‚Äôs investment management firm, snapped up 74,862 shares of the electric-vehicle maker across three of her exchange-traded funds, according to a daily transaction report sent via email. The purchase was valued around $11.7 million, based on Wednesday‚Äôs closing price of $156.80.\n\nThe snap-up by ARK also comes after Tesla's own chief executive officer Elon Musk sold approximately 21,995,000 shares of the company, or roughly $3.6 billion worth, during the three-day period ending Dec. 14, a regulatory filing showed after Wednesday's close.\n\nARK‚Äôs Tesla buy comprised 61,537 shares for the ARK Innovation fund (ARKK), 10,066 for the ARK Autonomous Tech. & Robotics ETF (ARKQ), and 3,259 for the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW). Tesla is the third largest holding among ARK‚Äôs suite of investment products after Zoom Communications (ZM) and Exact Sciences (EXAS).\n\nWood's dip-buying spree comes during a difficult month amid a difficult year for Tesla as concerns intensify among investors that Musk as CEO diverted his attention away from the company to manage Twitter, the social media platform he recently acquired in a $44 billion take-private deal.\n\nTesla stock is down more than 19% in December so far and roughly 55% year-to-date. ARK's flagship ARK Innovation fund (ARKK) is down around 13% this month and 64% on the year.\n\nFull article: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cathie-woods-ark-invest-buying-the-dip-tesla-elon-musk-112839188.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cathie-woods-ark-invest-buying-the-dip-tesla-elon-musk-112839188.html)", "id": "zmrwqj", "created_utc": 1671128053.0, "score": 125, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 73, "comments": [{"body": "Where does this chick find this money?", "score": 54, "replies": [{"body": "This is the question.

Still pricey perhaps but certainly nothing compared to other companies that offer great upside if things did play out well for them.\n\nNow I don't think above example is realistic. It's an absolute worst case scenario. I think it's more likely that they'll continue to grow earnings significantly each quarter.
