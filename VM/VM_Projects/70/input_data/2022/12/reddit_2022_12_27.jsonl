This same thing happened with LEAPS in AAPL calls in 2021. Everyone was pricing in $250. When shit became clear that wasn't in the cards, the value of the options tanked. It wasn't all theta. It was exuberance.  \n\nSimilar here IMO. Sure you'll make more with a short-term bond, but I'd be willing to bet that annualized the return on this option when you close it out is a lot more. Wouldn't be surprised if 3-6 months from now you could close it out and capture 80-90% of the premium.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "This is the way", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I'll buy TSLA when I start seeing his new fanbase trading in their F-350s for EVs.\n\nOr huge government subsidies for EVs from a newly elected Republican Congress.", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "So never?", "score": 6, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I sold a bunch of June $66 puts today for $5.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "I tried crazy stuff like that in the dot com days after we had some steep drops.
