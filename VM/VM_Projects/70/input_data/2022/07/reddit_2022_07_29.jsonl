She doubled down on that view at a press conference after the data release, noting that the substantial job losses, business shutdowns and strained budgets that typically accompany a recession are ‚Äúnot what we‚Äôre seeing right now‚Äù.\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôve never had a recession without lay-offs, [and] I don‚Äôt think we are close to a full-blown cycle of lay-offs. There‚Äôs just no evidence of that,‚Äù said Aneta Markowska, chief financial economist at Jefferies.\n\nEconomists point to the Sahm Rule. Developed by former Fed staffer Claudia Sahm, the rule stipulates that a recession takes root when the three-month moving average of the unemployment rate rises at least half a percentage point above its low over the past 12 months. By this metric, the unemployment rate would need to have surpassed 4 per cent to say the US is in recession.\n\nThe GDP data did, however, include signs of weakness beyond the headline figure that suggest a far less buoyant consumer and flagging investments. Economists at Citigroup went so far as to say that mid-2022 may mark a peak in activity.\n\nhttps://www.ft.com/content/50aac432-9dbe-4d82-a2c0-9e8823823ac9", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "The literal definition of recession is two consecutive quarters of negative gdp growth. ‚úÖ\n\nLayoffs?

The 2 quarters thing was always just something people went by. The way the market points to currently indicates that we may have been in a weak technical recession in the first half of the year but are quickly recovering from it. The later half of the year will just be another bull run. \n\nDon‚Äôt forget though. All the money printing the Fed did during COVID is the main cause of all this inflation.
