If you simply sell an ATM covered call every week on monday right at the open for example without regard to what the stock is doing or what the overall market is doing then it isn't a long term winning strategy.\n\nIt can work if the market goes sideways or slightly down or slightly up but as soon as it jumps way up you just missed out on a bunch of profit or if it jumps way down you just lost a bunch. You need to adapt to different market environments and think about what trade makes the most sense at the given time.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Makes sense. Although if someone’s goal is the easy cc premium, and they pocket this cash every single week/month without fail, you can’t say it “isn’t a long term winning strategy”.

Owning QQQ or SPY long term is almost guaranteed to make money at some point because the market is biased to go up long term for several reasons. So because of that the strategy is likely to make some money. \n\nBut constantly selling ATM calls on a recurring basis with no thought to the timing of it won't make you outperform the index unless maybe the implied volatility is consistently much higher than the realized volatility. By constantly selling that premium you're basically saying you believe the premium you are receiving will be greater than the average move on the underlying so eventually it will pay off to do it. \n\nIn many cases the strategy would work much better by just holding the underlying and not selling options. Then sell part of the stock for \"income\" every month or when it goes high enough. \n\nAlso selling calls does reduce the risk on the position and reduced risk generally means less potential reward.  So because of that the strategy is likely to underperform the index but at the same time it is a little safer than just owning the index.\n\nThe fund XYLD does pretty much what you're describing. Own the s&p 500 and sell at the money monthly calls. Over the last 5 years it has averaged returns of 5.63% while the s&p on its own returned 11.31%. And the last 5 years haven't exactly been a mega bull market. It's just slightly better than average.
