SPY and QQQ are actually pretty similar ETFs as both have major tech companies as key parts of the portfolio. If tech does well over the next decade or two then having a more tech heavy portfolio will be fantastic but just because tech did great in the past decade doesn’t mean that it is automatically going to get those same returns in the future so it all just depends on risk tolerance. One thing to also consider is adding some VTI or VT as well for some added diversification. VTI is mostly the same as SPY but with some mid and low cap thrown in and VT is mostly spy buy with international companies thrown in.
