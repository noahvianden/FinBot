The easy part of that is GPRO doesn’t pay a dividend so your only way to make money is capital appreciation. A lot of times the company will be the buyer but that’s not the case with GPRO, they issued 2.5% more shares over the past year so you have that as a headwind not a tailwind. The root question is will this company grow in the future? All companies go through a business cycle and if they don’t return capital to shareholders (pay a dividend or buyback shares) all companies will eventually go to $0. I think that GPRO has peaked already so I’m not interested in buying it, but if you think that the company still has good growth in the future then that’s another thing.\n\nAs a counter to some of your points.

The point was that it doesn't matter what you think about a company, it matter what the market thinks.

That's like hating on Michael Jordan or Wayne Gretsky because they played the same game but in a different time.  And every successful investor or trader can have a different approach to the markets.

I grabbed my book to look and the person who said it was Edward Thorpe. Give em a google. Again to reiterate, investors and traders can all have different philosophies. There is no one strategy to rule them all either. In fact, investors and traders differ in philosophy at the outset. As an investor, you only go long where a trader will go long and short. Some great traders think it's un american to short companies, while others only go short.  Some think technical analysis is astrology and doesn't work, while others make millions doing explicitly technical analysis.  If you read any of the market wizard books, or just hop on youtube and watch different traders, or read on any of these subreddits you'll see that. Trying to find some holy grail of how to make money in the markets is impossible, it's about finding what works best with your personality. And it's been independently researched, well researched for decades that 90%+ of traders lose. Why is that? Because of the innate human nature in humans is counter intuitive with making money in markets. Wanna know what that innate human nature is? Not being willing to admit when you're wrong. Most people simply can't do it so they hold onto losers instead of cutting them early.  There are idiots holding bags for years because \"they believe in the company.\" No, fuck your beliefs. Beliefs don't matter, results do.  And if a stock is shitty, accept it's shitty and move on to a not shitty stock. You don't owe any company any sort of loyalty. You trade the ticker, not the name. Anyways, you completely ignored the fact that nobody gives a fuck about the product they're selling because we all have that same product on our phones and the ones on our phones do a significantly better job now.
