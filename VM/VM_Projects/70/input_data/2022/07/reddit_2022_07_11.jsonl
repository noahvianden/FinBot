{"title": "How to Trade CPI day", "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9wfhc224txa91.png?width=683&format=png&auto=webp&s=f01117ebffa206bd9254a3d64de1b9dcf3ed43eb\n\n  \n\nOf the last 6 CPI days.. we have seen SPY open up red 4 out of 6 times and of those 4 times 3 out of the 4 times have been >1% red. Of the 2 out of 6 times that have been green both have opened less than 1% green. \n\nLooking at the actually intraday movement of CPI days there has only been one time (March) when SPY closed HIGHER than its opening price on CPI days… That means that essentially every CPI day we have see a morning dump (around 1030am) of SPY despite opening green. \n\nOf the two green opens for CPI only one of those actually closed green and even that one closed below opening. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dr3ydbh5txa91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b64545a435614e6674317aedb873fa679c58dd2\n\nWhat is very very interesting about this CPI is that this is the HIGHEST level of CPI that the fed has predicted yet. Remember just two months ago they tried to tell us that CPI was peaked yet here we are with a prediction of 8.8%. \n\nMy thoughts are that with the Feds projecting CPI to be 0.5% higher than their last projection which usually misses by about 0.2% at times I suspect we are going to get a reading of 9% CPI. \n\nWhen we get this 9% CPI we are going to see the VIX massively spike which will cause us to dump hard af. We then will for the next 2 weeks while we wait for FOMC, earnings and GDP continue to dump (I made a post last night about going long on VIX/ UVXY calls I definitely recommend you read it as it adds to all of this too). \n\nWhat is the play? \n\nI will be playing 5 OTM 0dte PUTS Tuesday night. I plan to open these around 414pm to prevent as much decay and iv crush as possible. \n\nAnother play (also in this one) is some August VIX/ UVXY calls \n\nAnd the final play would be some 7-14dte SPY Puts IF you believe we are going to massive dump this week. I would say by end of July my PT would be 330-340 SPY.", "id": "vwhw7o", "created_utc": 1657544465.0, "score": 133, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 75, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**|
