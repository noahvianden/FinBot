{"title": "7-20-22 SPY/ ES Futures Daily TA (little FOMC TA teaser... full post coming later this week)", "selftext": "Just when you think things are starting to settle down and we can trust the trend again‚Ä¶ they go an pull an ole fake dumper on us. A casual 14 reversals on the day‚Ä¶ looks like SPY is back to its normal self‚Ä¶\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/621mms9ndsc91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=30679dd53025f8c80e06ccdc8f19751e3bc8aa1e\n\nWhere are we at now? \n\nOn the daily we have a pretty good sized rising wedge forming and we have quite a few important levels to watch. \n\nIf we are truly going to fulfill this rising wedge then we will be looking to break the red dotted resistance line at 403. If we can get through that 403 level bulls are going to be targeting 410-415 by new Tuesday before FOMC. \n\nThey managed to close the candle in a way to avoid a hanging man and also avoid the doji we had most of the day. \n\nThe daily also broke the daily 50ema and close OVER it for the first time since April 20th. This is the first time that we have had a candle close over the daily 8, 20, and 50ema in nearly 3 months. Actually EXACTLY three months‚Ä¶ \n\nIm watching a head and shoulders pattern possibly forming that also points to the 410-415 price target in the new few trading days. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pfp22rgodsc91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=358bfae3018dac2b5e11ceec0e5565da16ac51cb\n\nNow the weekly is got a little bit different of a story that its telling right now. The weekly you can see we perfectly rejected that resistance line today at 396. That was a key rejection this morning (even before the dump). We also failed to retest it at the end of day when it was easily in site. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zhzf165pdsc91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=f28e87dfd7d4aab58da88076ed34b3a4b28f352d\n\nFutures not really giving much guidance here either as the daily candle isn‚Äôt really a reversal candle but does appear to be more doji like than the regular SPY daily candle due to the smaller body on it. This could be more indicative of a top. While it did close over the daily 8, 20 and 50ema this could be the top as even back in April when we hit the 50ema that became the top. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5adibhppdsc91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=c4a29d5cc2727876c2bd1e1d9b51d20f76dcfb35\n\nFutures weekly we remained under the resistance line and did not get a complete touch of it like we did on SPY today. \n\nBull case- tesla just came in with a nice beat here and with ‚Äúno new bad news‚Äù we could be seeing more bullish catalysts for the rest of the week. Will definitely be interesting to see how tesla settles over night. Today as I mentioned is the first time we closed over the 8, 20, and 50ema in 3 months. Apple actually close over its 8, 20, 50, 100 AND 200 EMA for the first time in two months also. This is actually extremely bullish for Apple as it hasn‚Äôt broken that key resistance since May. The daily 8ema just crossed above the 20ema for first time since June. Despite the big dump today (similar to apple based off old Google news I guess‚Ä¶) we have seen a very large bounce intraday and it was clear that the dump was a buying opportunity. \n\nBulls finally saw key 24.2 VIX break and VIX had the lowest low since April 22nd. \n\nBulls will want to see this hold 394 support tomorrow (daily 50ema) and then break through that 396 level to break through the weekly resistance level. I am not bullish until we see that 396 weekly resistance cleanly broken. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uyat9hcqdsc91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=284d1847b6b47ecac3515db9becf729e0a80de02\n\nBear case- So above you see a chart that shows the Wednesday before FOMC for June. What do you see? You see the 50ema reached with a 8 and 20ema cross over. You then see that Wednesday was the peak before we dumped for 4 days leading to FOMC. There is a case to be made that today was the peak at 396 and for the rest of the week and next we are going to see a big dump. The blue line represents a similar trajectory which could give us a channel support (green solid line or orange solid line) bounce at 350 to 355. \n\nIn addition bear case wise while the bulls could say that they caught a bad break with that 396 rejection right before the google news you could also ague that it finally hit a level that sellers overcame buyers. Despite finding a fairly quick bottom and not dumping all day like Monday we were not able to recover back to HOD. The ES futures candle is definitely a doji and SPY daily candle is doji like which could indicate a top. Even though TESLA beat earnings we are seeing SPY red after hours right now. \n\nDespite the VIX break down today we were unable to see it make a new low. The VIX held the same support level of 23.8 that we saw held the week before FOMC in June. \n\nBears are going to want to break down that support line from July 14th seeing a break below 394.7 tomorrow breaks the support line. A break below 392.7 would be a bearish breakdown of previous resistance and could and would make todays candle a true top candle much like we saw on June 27th and July 8th. \n\nOverall my bias is definitely struggling here. On one hand that dump had heavy volume behind it and we finally saw the VIX interacting with SPY again. However, as soon as the VIX started to unwind is when they yanked it back. We are now exactly one week from FOMC and historical data tells me that we are at our peak for SPY and our bottom for the VIX. I expected tesla could beat earnings and could drive the market green for the next two days with expectations of good earnings for the rest of the big 10 next week, however, tesla is now falling red as I write this. \n\nMy thoughts are there is actually a fairly big chance we are going to see people finally start to worry about FOMC. With all the hiring issues big tech is having and jobs tomorrow this could finally become a big deal. Markets may finally be understanding that we are seeing big issues in big tech and that they may miss earnings. \n\nMy two pivots are 392.7 to be bearish and 397.4 to be bullish for rest of the week. \n\n10% challenge-\n\nOne of those days where you just time it all wrong unfortunately. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5am69y1rdsc91.png?width=763&format=png&auto=webp&s=da48707866014aee43a163c8a178626eedcec087\n\nHad the worthless Netflix put not a big deal‚Ä¶ by the way I really think this earnings season is gonna be a bad one to play. \n\nThe SPX call haunts me‚Ä¶ watched it go to 80% over night before bed (of course cant sell though) and then opened red. The volatility this morning was wild and we looked like the bull day was off (wasn‚Äôt quite wrong) theta was eating the crap outta it being so far OTM‚Ä¶ closed for a loss to reposition and of course then we had the 10am to 1045am $4 rally literally seconds later‚Ä¶ at the top woulda ben a nice 50% gain minimum.\n\nDid get two more nice SPX scalps though \n\nAnd then the 1215am dump came in. I tried litereally the whole way down to get a limit order fill and it just kept skipping over me over and over and over. I shoulda just entered a market order I guess but those massive candles like that can be deadly on market orders. Finally saw it settle at that 392.7 support and at the time it looked like it was just resting before it continued to dump like we did on Monday‚Ä¶ entered puts and pretty much immediately ripped against me. And then they got me on the 2pm fake out dump. Shoulda exited then but alas.\n\nThe lesson is trend days are dangerous to our mentality and we still have to stick to our rules. This markets ruthless. \n\nWe have to keep our position size manageable so that we do not let one day capitulate us and ruin our day trading career. As soon as you think you‚Äôve got this market figured out it has a surprise up its sleeve for you.\n\nThe volatility today was some of the highest on individual 1min candles and on the 15minute candles that I have seen in a long time. For the VIX only being at 25 the way some of these candles moved (both green and red today) was like the VIX was back above 35‚Ä¶ who knows maybe it was our hint we are going higher?", "id": "w3x7sj",
