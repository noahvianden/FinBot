Among the orosceptics, we have a more heterogeneous group that includes the well-known Warren Buffet as the figurehead.

It has been that way for the last seven thousand years, they say. They say that gold is the real asset that allows you to store more value in less space. They allude to the fact that the history of humanity has had phases in which gold and money were the same thing, periods in which gold supported the value of money and that since the breakup of the gold standard in the early seventies, gold is a very effective way to protect wealth. The best protection whether the threat is the price of oil and its effect on inflation (as happened in the first two oil crises at the beginning of 1973 and 1979) or if the risk is the maelstrom with which central banks grow their bases monetary, as it happens recently.", "id": "vj0edr", "created_utc": 1656000394.0, "score": 19, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 76, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|2|**First Seen In WSB**|4 minutes ago\n**Total Comments**|0|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|3 weeks|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=vj0edr)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=vj0edr)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I once believed the bs.
