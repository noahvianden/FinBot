{"title": "A contrarian opinion about the “imminent recession”", "selftext": "I don’t know shit about fuck - If my opinion offends you, then you can click off now.\n\nMarkets are heavily influenced by psychology, as well as a multitude of other factors. Currently as of writing this, the S&P 500 has corrected down approximately ~18% from ATH. This is quite the correction, enough so that many think we may experience a rough market downturn into recession.\n\nI hear many sentiments within these posts about future projections of how this recession will take place. *”Just wait until the layoffs happen”*, *”Puts on anything are free money”*, *”CPI keeps going up it’s clearly runaway inflation”*, etc. However, all of these sentiments are based on previous recession indicators in from that had different economic situations.\n\nThe Great Depression in 1929 is still highly debated among economists of why it happened. Obviously the great stock market crash occurred at the beginning, and many different schools of economic thought describe this event as prescriptive of the depression or a consequence of the the depression. However what we do know is that stock market crash greatly reduced consumer savings, caused a lack of confidence in the financial services industry, run on banks, and eventual job losses. Ultimately what pulled out the US from depression was the start of World War II and the extreme surplus of GDP caused by wartime production.\n\n2008 was largely caused by the packaging of junk bonds and mortgage backed securities into their own basket which was rated by investment agencies as better than they actually were. Along with the abuse of derivatives by financial companies such as Lehman brothers, etc - a housing bubble was created and ultimately popped leaving the pain onto consumers while the government bailed out banks.\n\n2020 (mini COVID recession) a flight to safety occurred where money was pulled radically out of financial products due to an extreme lack of confidence in global supply chains and globalized companies due to the outbreak of COVID-19. Subsequent lockdowns caused layoffs, a decrease in consumer income, and shortages from supply chains (bull whip effect). The overall pandemic was considered bad enough that the government allowed for trillion dollars in Covid related aid as well as stimulus packages for common Americans.\n\nMany say we’re heading into another recession because of the current market sell off and a multitude of factors such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict, runaway inflation, and Shanghai lockdowns for Covid. Overall, things look pretty bad.\n\nBut, and many will roll their eyes at this statement, the stock market is the most forward looking indicator in our entire economy. Many believe that the market is the culmination of all information related to the US economy synthesized into industries and indexes with dollar values. There is one caveat to the stock market though, it caters to the top 1%. The wealthiest 10% of Americans hold 89% of all stock holdings. \n\n#Let me repeat, the wealthiest 10% of Americans hold 89% of all stock holdings.\n\nThe covid stimulus presented an interesting thought experiment that I will walk through based on the covid recession and why the stock market behaved as it did. After the crash, many of us believed it would take years for the sp500 to return to its previous levels, however looking at the chart, in a span of roughly 6 months we were back at ATH. I truly believe much of this upward price movement was due to the stimulus checks given during COVID and the large amount of quantitative easing by the federal reserve. Additionally, inflation was rising back then, and don’t forget equities and financial assets are affected by inflation just as much, if not more by the increase in prices.\n\nNow we’re in a period where the federal reserve is reducing treasury holdings, and high inflation is reducing consumer savings so they have less to invest. However, high inflation does not affect the top 10% of incomes in America. They simply reduce the amount of luxuries they spend on. We’re also in a period called the “great resignation”, where the opportunity for remote work has caused a labor shortage since high skilled workers are able to work at companies at a national scale without having to move locations. I believe this is more reasoning that we are *not* heading towards recession.\n\nWill there be job losses? Yes. But not for the people that it matters. See, everyone knows that America has been trending towards the middle class shrinking and causing a split where you are either a high income earner, or you are below the poverty level. This has increased over time due to student loans causing even middle income earners stuck living pay check to pay check from debt repayments. I believe much of the sell off is due to retail investors being pressured from high inflation to sell their savings for liquid cash to purchase gas and groceries. Don’t forget, an extra 2400 in your pocket from Covid, and more if you claimed unemployment, caused a rapid increase in retail holdings in the stock market - especially during the rise of “meme stocks”. Side bar, like bro I was in a fuckin Uber and he’s asking me about what I think about AMC or GME, like wtf. The market experienced mania after the Covid crash, with retail buying anything and everything from shitcoins, AMC, to egg future contracts with no plans to actually own the commodity. And now, retail is selling out from the need of short term liquidity to fulfill basic needs like food and gas.\n\nHowever, the top 10% of Americans aren’t as fearful as during Covid and pulling out of their 401ks or retirement funds. Financial services companies like Goldman or jpm are actually hiring at a more rapid pace right now due to the large amount of high skilled workers looking for new jobs. The only people, as always in American, that are going to be hurt are the lowest 25% of incomes. There’s a common adage in the finance industry that says, “sell in May and go away”. After this mania occurred, market cycles still continue as normal, except normal market cycle sell offs are magnified by first time inexperienced retail investors cashing out their investments bought during the mania, in fear of losing it all and missing out on the opportunity cost of buying the goods they need to survive. I truly believe, this downswing will not last as long as we believed. Don’t forget the news will always be bearish during market downturns, but these media companies typically skew the opposite of what smart money or big money is doing in the market. I’m not saying next week SPY will go racing to ATHs again. I’m saying the combined unique scenario of pumping the average Americans wallets with Covid relief money during a time when our orange man was saying V-shaped recovery and inflation pumping equity prices may result in a normal correction - but not a recession. Despite what everyone says, the job market is actually very strong for skilled workers right now. Many of these workers are seeing 10 to 20% salary increases from switching companies. While layoffs occur, most of the higher income Americans right now are doing excellent in this economy. Which means, eventually people will buy this dip, and retail will feel left out again because they panic sold while big money and smart money laughed at them. This all goes back to my sentiment that the market has a lot of psychology involved, and the mania experienced during Covid with meme stocks and free money caused a rapid increase which obviously needed to correct down again, but don’t expect recession right away.\n\nI will say, anyone who bought leap calls during the falling knife of Covid would’ve been extremely profitable, or even just dollar cost averaging shares. My honest opinion is probably by October we’ll see a strong bull market again, but I wouldn’t be surprised to just see some large swings in both directions with an overall sideways movement in the stock market from now own. The market is going to bleed out retail and then big money is going to move in like it’s always been. My advice would be don’t be too bearish, because there will be a time when big money cycles back into equities. \n\nTLDR: high inflation hurts the lowest 25% of Americans the most. The highest 10% of incomes own 89% of stock market holdings. Labor market is strong for high skilled workers. Recession may not be imminent, but retail getting caught holding the bag definitely is.", "id": "vb0itn", "created_utc": 1655083353.0, "score": 33, "upvote_ratio": 0.69, "num_comments": 78, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|48|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|906|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tf29r7/dd_hedgefunds_best_kept_secret_until_now/) \n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=vb0itn)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=vb0itn)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "This ain't no movement you fuckin mouthbreather.
