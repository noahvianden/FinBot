{"title": "$BROS, the casino may be back", "selftext": "Hello Ladies & Gents,\n\nI’m back for another failure of a pick, and I’ve been eating ramen ever since. Let me introduce you to $BROS.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/why09afosm391.png?width=1284&format=png&auto=webp&s=78bd790679620000b4e8fa86578099403dd49552\n\nWhat is $BROS\n\n>Dutch Bros Inc. operates and franchises drive-thru shops. It offers Dutch Bros hot and cold espresso-based beverages, and cold brew coffee products, as well as Blue Rebel energy drinks, tea, lemonade, smoothies, and other beverages through company-operated shops and online channels. As of May 11, 2022, it operated 572 drive-thru coffee locations across 12 states in the United States. The company was founded in 1992 and is headquartered in Grants Pass, Oregon.\n\nSweet. Here’s a picture from their [S-1](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001866581/000162828021018412/dutchbross-1a2.htm) and it’s what convinced me to invest in $BROS.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c2fru3faue391.png?width=1470&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab228bd7b26690ba27b7f885cc8b1fa0633e7232\n\nLong story short, some firm bottom ticked. They tanked $BROS after atrocious earnings thinking business as usual let’s destroy another company. Sucks for them, the market and $BROS have been running ever since - ***bottom ticked.*** \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gqgvod1fue391.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c9e45d37c69c20c870e73daf7efcede110221e5\n\nNo way in hell that  $BROS down 40% the day after ER is now a couple weeks later close to recapturing a key level of $40 without something being wrong — that’s a better post-er performance than $AMZN $FB $NFLX $WMT $TGT and cathie woods \"growth\" stocks like $COIN $TDOC $DOCU etc. To recap, $BROS makes coffee …. specifically in Oregon.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h8rzkhugue391.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=5728ce74c63cb3d451914ab097244674c8f00727\n\nLook at the $BROS graph, now look at $SPY.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rh5a5bdiue391.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=56e5dd1a90c64488ca09ab0f5b8eea95a9d75d4c\n\n$BROS since the ER tank has encountered $SPY death days, however, $BROS has been impervious going green each time. So yah, someone is being fucked on the other side.\n\nThe real shorts are in Hawaii right now smoking a bong and patting themselves on the back after destroying firm after firm for 7weeks straight - pure bliss. Bottom feeders are the shorts who wanted one last hurrah with $BROS and now scrambling to defend $40. These guys have been staring at their screen everyday since wondering “*why didn’t I just take the W and stop trading, I could be chilling right now instead of watching this shitco go up everyday.*” \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4u35hiljue391.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2858a81a45d2272cbbe921a4024ad9273fa132de\n\nBelow you can see that $BROS can run 15%+ in a day for multiple days. For a stock with this behavior implied vol is low in the 50’s. Can also see defense at the $40 price level, a key one for $BROS. The screenshot below is from 5/27, as of today (6/1) $BROS has recovered right back to $40. The market is also more conducive now, ignoring FUD and just ripping everyday for no reason. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bqo7xmjlue391.png?width=1872&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1ea7395ff69c75634b9eb09eb3b116a59c1f807\n\nIn conclusion, conditions are right in the market for something stupid to happen. So, purify yourself in $BROS and drink from the waters of Lake Minnetonka.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zsb1ydemue391.jpg?width=700&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a47f693200d24e6d1294741651fee46c9c4dae04\n\n\\------\n\nUpdate: $SPY down -1.5%, $BROS up 4.1%+ and gaining steam ... yup makes sense. Ripping for yet another day. Once $SPY continues its retard rally ways things get interesting. Option volume shows that no one gives af about this post lol, so this is just $BROS being $BROS.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "v3zx4p", "created_utc": 1654264433.0, "score": 39, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 77, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|4|**First Seen In WSB**|8 months ago\n**Total Comments**|67|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|9 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=v3zx4p)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=v3zx4p)\n    \nHey /u/doinshit_nah, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Fine I’ll put 10 bucks into it", "score": 30, "replies": [{"body": "[Get ready to have only 1 bucks when Dutch Bros goes down like a sinking ship](https://youtu.be/qluFYy2iiac?t=430)", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Retards saying shit like this obviously don't have a Dutch Bros in their town.
