(A quick Evaluation Part II) with adjusted data", "selftext": "Good Evening Folks!\n\n*Here i am again doing shenanigans with balance sheets and numbers!* ***I would like to thank everyone last time for replying and giving advices or pointing out mistakes and bs***\\*; you can see the previous posts\\* [*here*](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/y0tob8/intel_corp_stock_evaluation_tldr_3608_undervalued/)*.*\n\n*I am a Business Economy & Management Student and i recently found i passion for Financial Analysis, Indeed, i would like to become a Financial Analysts myself. I know i have lots to learn and many experience to cover, that is why i am practicing daily. I am sharing my exercises so i can get opinions, advices and indications, and surely this will help every one intended to learn and improve!*\n\n*Click* [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TQLUA4DW0MTjz-OY6EunKDqvCYFFdjLO/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=111541358396870593416&rtpof=true&sd=true) *to check the Excel file where i did my math*\n\n# Some Briefing\n\nI made adjustments and fixed some numbers from my last analysis. The Final Price is the average of all the evaluation methods listed.\n\n* *Graham Fair Value Formula*\n* *CFO Evaluation*\n* *Discounted Unlevered Free Cash Flow*\n* *Dividend Discount Model*\n* *Total Payout Valuation Model*\n\n**Changes from the previous post:**\n\n* **Use of Annual Data**: In the last one I used quarterly data and forecasted it as it was annual lol (what an idiot)\n* **Use of Unlevered Free Cash Flow**: I used Free Cash flow to do DCF in the last one\n* **Use of Growth Rate calculated by me**\n* **Tax of 8.46%** calculated by me, in the last one i just guessed one randomly loool\n* **Fixed Unlevered Beta**: Used MCap and Long tern & Short Term Debt to calculate Unlevered Beta instead of using Shareholders Equity\n\n**Final Introductory Notes:**\n\n* **I did not compare Intel to is competitors** nor the industry sector, i plan to, this is just a quick analysis\n* **I didn't do the Scenario Analysis** to forecast the revenue from Intel's product segments, i factored all the possible variations in sales with a conservative estimate of the company growth of 0.71%, the number is based on its last year's net earnings. The growth rate of 0.71% is used in every valuation methods used. Note: Analysts growth rate for the next 5 years for Intel is: -0.16%\n* To better calculate the growth rate, i need the percentage of earnings that are not distributed to investors. I calculated the retained one as 71.59% and the distributed portion of 28.41%. I am not sure if this is correct, thus i assumed a retention rate of 5% to be conservative, if you have some indication please do not restrain yourself thanks!\n* In the Dividend Discount Model, i used the calculated company growth rate of **0.71%** and not the average of the last 9 years of 5.64%. This is due to the fact that i see it as an unreasonable growth rate for dividend for the next near future. This model is based of Gordon's Growth Model (with constant growth in dividend).\n* **As Discount Rate, i used mainly CAPM** form most of the evaluation methods, even tho is calculated WACC, i used it only for the Total Payment Valuation Method.\n* **I made also a Risk Analysis**, but i think it is fucked up, and thus it shall not be considered at all and skipped lol\n* **Company has a cash burn rate of 0.50** and 6 months remaing, i dont know why, it seems odd not gonna lie but i still have to figure out what is wrong.

As for Intel's current situation, its value shall be round $33.14 in normal market conditions.|\n|**FCF Evaluation**|Taking in mind CFO for 29,991,000 thousands, CapEx of 20,329,000 thousands and Cash & Cash Equivalents of 4,827,000 thousands, Fair Value is 38.98 in Normal market conditions. Some said that Cash & Cash equivalents is around 50B, but in the balance sheet i see only the Total Current Assets around that number. This gives us a price of $38.98|\n|**Discounted Unlevelead Free Cash Flow**|This model observe past Unlevered Free Cash Flow and Forecast the growth of it for the next 5 years. Growth rate is a conservative 0.71% putting Fair Value Price for the next year to $19.22. Note that the future is unpredictable and this model shall use different growth rate for each year forecasted. The value is calculated assuming that the current market condition persists for the next 5 years.|\n|**Dividend Discount Model**|This model observes the historical variation of Yearly Dividends. It is based on the principle that a Company Value is due to the Present Value of all its future dividends. Gordon's Growth Model is the DDM assuming a constant growth of the dividend and this DDM is based on that assumption. The fact that 5% growth is not sustainable in current market condition, i sued the calculated growth rate that i made, 0.71%, giving us a Value of $24.09 assuming a constant growth of dividend by that rate. This is conservative estimate.|\n|**Total Payout Valuation Model**|This method is an alternative to DDM and try to extrapolate the Fair Value from its dividend payout. This method is the only one where i used WACC as discount rate. Why? cause the formula i got raid WACC instead of a general \"discount rate\" loooool.|\n\n# Intel's Semiconductor Market Share\n\n|Year|Market Share|\n|:-|:-|\n|2008|13.30%|\n|2009|14.60%|\n|2010|14.00%|\n|2011|16.50%|\n|2012|16.40%|\n|2013|15.40%|\n|2014|15.40%|\n|2015|15.40%|\n|2016|15.90%|\n|2017|13.80%|\n|2018|14.00%|\n|2019|15.70%|\n|2020|15.60%|\n|2021|12.20%|\n\nSource: [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/266143/global-market-share-of-leading-semiconductor-vendors/)\n\n# Intel Corp.

I can's comment on management cause i still have to check it. Short Term and Long Term Debts are increasing, surely due to this year shenanigans in the overall market. We can observe a small increase in Unleveread Free Cash Flow and PP&E. The company so far has paid dividend regularly, so if it is in severe situation, we shall expect it to stop distributing earnings, until then, we shall not be alarmed.\n\n**In conclusion**, *Intel is following market movements and is in a geopolitical crossfire, which affects is competitors too. We shall not forget that it is in danger regarding lagging really hard behind competitors, they need to invest more in R&D and Marketing, cut inventories and operational expenses, i sense some inefficiency in the Business Structure.*\n\n# Final Notes\n\nYooo My Evaluation goes really near Barclays' price target for Intel LOL!\n\n|Institution|Rating|Position|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Barclays**|$30|Underweight|\n|**Wells Fargo**|$32|Equal-Weight|\n|**Northland Capital**|$52|Outperform|\n|**Goldman Sachs**|24$|Sell|\n|**Deutsch Bank**|$35|Hold|\n|**Stifel**|$32|Hold|\n\n**Intel Earnings Date**: 27th October 2022 AFH. \"*According to Zacks Investment Research, based on 14 analysts' forecasts, the consensus EPS forecast for the quarter is $0.34.
