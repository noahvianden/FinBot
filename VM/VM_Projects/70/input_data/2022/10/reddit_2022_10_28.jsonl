Kennedy said \"There is nothing more unfortunate than to have soft, chubby, fat looking children\".\n\nEveryone in the 1960s agreed with Kennedy because they knew he was right.  Today in 2022, in the name of \"political correctness\" and \"woke ideology\" people are afraid to call a fat person fat.  They pretend that being fat is somehow normal and won't eventually harm them, which it always does.  High blood pressure, diabetes, stroke, and numerous other medical conditions arise from obesity.  Fat kids turn into fat adults (like the woman in the photo) who then develop all kinds of health problems.\n\nHere is the Kennedy speech about fat kids:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnUL9xt\\_aW8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnUL9xt_aW8)", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "I agree that it is a disease and needs to be treated as such, no disease is treated by being a cock tho.
