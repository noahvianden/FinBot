Failure to do so risks dysfunction that “would be  difficult to contain and fix.”\n\nLeveraged  finance markets are reeling this week after the Fed’s latest rate hike  in its aggressive campaign to tame inflation. US junk bonds are headed  for worst year-to-date losses on record, while banks were forced to shelve a buyout deal in the leveraged loan market after struggling to attract demand from investors. \n\nInvestors fled  risky assets over fears of a recession, pulling $3 billion from  high-yield bonds and $1.9 billion from leveraged loans in the week ended  Sept. 28, according to data from Refinitiv Lipper.\n\nSpreads  in the high-yield market could rise to around 600 to 650 basis points  if the Fed continues with its pace of rate hikes, said BofA.
