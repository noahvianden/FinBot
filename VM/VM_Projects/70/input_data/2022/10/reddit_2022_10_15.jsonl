Mooney introduced H.R. 9157, the “Gold Standard Restoration Act.” \n\nThe legislation calls for the U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve to publicly disclose all gold holdings and gold transactions within 30 months, after which time the Federal Reserve note “dollar” would be pegged to a fixed weight of gold at its then-market price. Federal Reserve notes would become fully redeemable for and exchangeable with gold at the new fixed price, with the U.S. Treasury and its gold reserves backstopping Federal Reserve Banks as guarantor.\n\n“The gold standard would protect against Washington’s irresponsible spending habits and the creation of money out of thin air,” said Congressman Alex X. Mooney. ”Prices would be shaped by economics rather than the instincts of bureaucrats. No longer would our economy be at the mercy of the Federal Reserve and reckless Washington spenders.”\n\nBACKGROUND: The Gold Standard Restoration Act also makes several findings as to the harm the Federal Reserve System has inflicted on everyday Americans – particularly since President Richard Nixon “temporarily suspended” gold backing of America’s monetary system in 1971.\n\nThe Federal Reserve note has lost more than 30 percent of its purchasing power since 2000, and 97 percent of its purchasing power since the passage of the Federal Reserve Act in 1913.Economists have observed that the elimination of gold redeemability from the monetary system freed central bankers and federal government officials from accountability when they irresponsibly expand the money supply, fund government deficits though trillion-dollar bond purchases, or otherwise manipulate the economy.\n\nThe bill would also require full disclosure of all central bank and U.S. government gold holdings and gold-related financial transactions over the last 6 decades. H.R. 9157 requires the Fed and the Treasury to disclose all records pertaining to redemptions and transfers of United States gold in the 10 years preceding the temporary suspension in August 15, 1971, of gold redeemability obligations.", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "I've held gold since mid Trump administration and given the whacky bullshit that's been happening since the price has been flatter than a Thai thirst trap.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "si si senior.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "This deflation is driving gold down", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Gold is always manipulated", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "No because the dollar is strong and gold gets weaker the stronger the dollar is, Regard", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Not for long anymore.
