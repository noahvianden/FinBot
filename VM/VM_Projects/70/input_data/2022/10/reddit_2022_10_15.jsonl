Price inflation lags monetary inflation, which is why it took over a year for an unprecedented increase in money supply to cause CPI and PCE to increase. \n\nNow we‚Äôre seeing unprecendented monetary *deflation* which will ultimately lead to significant price deflation. Of course the Fed knows this but they are so focused on their short-term credibility that comes in the form of CPI and PCE prints that they will once again overshoot in the opposite direction.\n\nThe worst part is that deflation could be extremely difficult to get out of, especially as our debt-to-GDP is approaching levels that make policymakers uncomfortable. Just look at Japan in the 90s or the Eurozone post-GFC. \n\nThe Fed is making another huge mistake and as more people become educated about this emerging Eurodollar crisis, hopefully the Fed will pause or reverse course.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "I honestly hope the market thinks this.
