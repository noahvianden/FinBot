Basically they'll never be able to convert a lot of their revenue into earnings so they need to trade at a lower multiple.\n\nCOIN is low PS because it's revenue is currently shrinking. The TTM PS is lower simply because  future revenues will be lower than those of the prior 12 months.\n\nIBM is a bit of a combination between poor growth and poor operating margins. Basically investors don't believe revenue will grow that much going forward and with current margins they trade at a market multiple on earnings.", "score": 70, "replies": [{"body": "Square's revenue is a bit inflated because Cash App has to count the gross volume of Bitcoin transactions as revenue due to accounting rules when Cash App only makes like 1% from Bitcoin transactions.", "score": 16, "replies": []}, {"body": "Square is not quite a payments company IMO, most of their products (like invoicing software, payroll software, inventory software, website builder, consumer banking, business banking, business loans) aren't that closely related to payments.

Have they flopped a little recently? Sure. But as soon as the next crypto rally happens, which is all but inevitable, coinbase should be positioned to have incredible revenues again.\n\nI think this is a super contrarian opinion, but I also think most investors lack the insight into the crypto \"industry\" and fail to account for overall market growth, which already went to 2+ trillion in the last bull cycle, could go to many multiples of that, and market consolidation, which hasn't happened at all. Coinbase is the most established and trusted US (and somewhat European) player in this trillion dollar industry, but there are plenty of other exchanges that operate in the US (Kraken is probably the best target) and other great businesses in new emergent spaces like Defi and NFTs.\n\nPersonally, I think they have really easy plays ahead of them. They've been a bit stupid, trying to build everything in house. They are the dominant player now, they should be doing things like acquiring and consolidating. If they make moves like acquiring OpenSea and Nexo/Blockfi, and start consolidating instead of trying to build themselves, they'll position themselves to be the dominant player for years to come.", "score": 7, "replies": []}, {"body": "Why would anyone look at Price to Sales?", "score": 12, "replies": []}, {"body": "A screener showed me JXN has a P/S of 0.22.

The main question is can these buisnesses start growing revenue again. Obiously with the current P/S ratio the market doesn't think so. But I think the market is wrong in the case of DXC (which I've done more research on) they provide IT infrastructure services for a significant amount of the fortune 500. Some of this work has gone to the cloud which is why revenue has been declining but there are a plethora of applications that can't afford the latency penalty or can't host data on the cloud due to regulatory and security concerns. Furthermore DXC is very involved in migrating a customer's infrastructure to the cloud and upgrading a customer's Security and Networking which obiously has increased importance when the data is offsite. There are even some companies who decide to do private cloud. Essentially they own the infrastructure themselves and have DXC manage it. This in peticular is a big revenue opprotunity for DXC. All this doesn't even touch upon DXC's custom software buisness and data anyalitics buisness. It represents half of DXC's revenue and its growing. The data anaylitics buisness is a competitor to companies like $PLTR (albeit less impressive) and the custom software buisness is a competitor to $EPAM. An example of a custom software application is the infotainment screen in Volkswagen cars. I am prepared to hold this thing for 10 years but honestly if the stock never goes up and they keep buying back shares at this rate (they repurchased 4% of the float last quater) the're will be 30% less shares outstanding in 2 years if revenue starts to grow like I am expecting and the buisness keeps improving I the stock kinda has to go up. But when you consider that DXC's competitors TCS and ACN are $100 Billion+ companies and DXC is only worth $7 Billion that kinda gives you an idea of the opprotunity.

Also for what its worth I expect alot of KD's revenue to runoff because much of those contracts don't have good margins (by $KD's own admission) It made sense when they where part of IBM but now that $KD is independent they need to offload alot of that stuff to push up the margin.
