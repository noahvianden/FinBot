{"title": "Investing in crashing S&P 500 while EUR/USD is also crashing (european investor)", "selftext": "I am a starting long term investor believing in\n\n-time in the market > timing the market\n-etf investor, diversification in an etf is enough\n-correlation between S&P 500 and AllWorld etf and europe Etf is high enough to neglect the difference\n-20 years + horizon\n-wanna invest 30k € now and each month 1500 € after that\n-i am believing in 25% crash of S&P 500 rn is a once in a long while opportunity and feel lucky about my market timing. Feels like a head start compared to unlucky ones who started investing in Dec2021. \n-S&P will go up sooner or later and we might be close to the end of the all time lows. \n\nPlease accept the abovementioned beliefs. \n\nCurrent strategy:\n\nEven though S&P 500 might crash 45℅-50℅ of its ATH (or not), there is a chance that 25% crash we have rn might be the dip so I don't wanna miss out on this opportunity to go in. I won't regret putting all my money now and then the market crashes even more and I keep buying each month the crashed version of the market. \n\nHere is the main question to you guys:\n\nFrom the european investor perspective, the 25% crash in S&P 500 while the EUR/USD crashed 14% means that the ETF is down 11% when one must buy overly high valued dollars. 11% crash is what the vanguard S&P 500 etf in euro also shows. 11% crash is less than a once in a while opportunity. If I was american, since I would save my money in dollars and dollar gained value, I would see it as a 25% crash but as a european it is 11% crash. Isn't it a better idea to invest on european etf's like DAX and AEX and Europe 50 (all three would mean enough diversified for me) which crashed 25% because it is in euro's? Given that the world stocks rn go up and down pretty much correlated. Lets say all stocks go up 10% after I buy, but if this happens usd probably loses 5% or sth so my net gain would be smaller compared to investing in european etfs. \nI don't believe that EUR/USD goes up without S&P going up. So the question is: is it a good idea or what do I miss here?", "id": "xyvbxi", "created_utc": 1665242333.0, "score": 89, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 70, "comments": [{"body": "US stocks are quoted in USD however, this can be converted into any other currency.\n\nThe true currency which stocks are priced in are the underlying currency of their revenue streams.\n\nFor example,\n\nCompany earns 50 EUR and 50 USD in a year. They are quoted in USD. Let's assume their price is 100 USD and EUR to USD is 1:1. Their total revenue in USD is 100.\n\nIf the next year they earn 50 EUR and 50 USD, but EUR is lower, let's say EUR/USD is 0.95. Their total revenue in USD is 97.5.\n\nBecause their revenue dropped in USD, then their stock price would be 97.5 USD. Their revenue rose in EUR, their stock price is 102.63 EUR.\n\nNothing fundamental has changed about the business nor has there been a 'true' change in stock price either. It's simply lower in USD because the underlying business had 50% EUR revenues and 50% USD revenues. If it went the other way and EUR appreciated, then it would be 97.5 EUR and 102.63 USD.\n\nIf the company was quoted in a special currency of 50% EUR and 50% USD, then their price would not change at all.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that, some of the drop in SP500 is due to USD appreciation - SP500 companies earns more than one-third of revenues outside US.\n\nThat is why you can see in some company reports \"constant currency\" YoY comparisons. For example, MSFT grew 16% at CC (constant currency) but only 12% factoring in USD appreciation impact. \n\nWhen you look at a company's valuation, it's important to know both figures so you can get an idea of the factors behind the stock price dropping.\n\nMSFT is down 20.56% in the past year. The factors behind that drop are USD strength, 10 Year Yield strength (multiple compression), and other factors.\n\nIf the USD dropped 17% one year from now, and the 10 Year yield dropped 2.3%, MSFT would reverse all their losses in the past year and then some (since they're buying back stock and still growing).\n\nCompanies having weaker fundamentals is also related to the higher interest rates and USD strength.\n\nThat's why from my perspective, the price of MSFT last year and this year are both fair to invest in. One is priced based on weaker USD and low 10 year, today it's priced based on stronger USD and higher 10 year. \n\nThat's why there's no point paying attention to the quoted exchange rates at all, because companies are already priced in an unquoted mixed currency. As you said, if the USD drops, the SP500 will go up. \n\nThe only time where there should be concern is if the company's operations are actually failing. \n\nIf you want to predict exchange rates or interest rate changes, there are specific instruments to trade directly in forex or futures on different duration treasuries (to get as much or as little sensitivity as you want). \n\nThe entirety of the SP500 drop in the past year is due to interest rates and exchange rates. Companies have different sensitivity to exchange rates and interest rates. Then you have the secondary impact on the economy and speculation. \n\nWhat then separates a good performing company versus poor performing company over the mid-long term?\n\nTheir underlying operations as all companies are subject to good and bad economic conditions.", "score": 50, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for your answer.
