The decision is pretty easy.\n\n\\- Tesla has loads of pricing power due to very high profit margins\n\n\\- They go from record to record each quarter\n\n\\-  They're (virtually) debt free (unlike all competitors which are mostly 100bn+ in debt).\n\n\\- Vertical integration. The amount of flexibility and first mover potential/advantage that comes with this seems to fly under the radar of most.\n\n\\-  They have the pick of the best and brightest when it comes to hiring (this is probably the major reason why Tesla is going to be successful in the long term. Product 'now' is one thing. But long term it's about people.)\n\n\\- They have other parts of the company set to bloom (energy being the prime candidate that is set to take off now that the battery supply block seems to be getting resolved. But stuff like the semi with FSD could be a game changer in the trucking business - even if it's relegated to highways, only. I'm not even counting the possibilities of robotaxi or Tesla bot)\n\n\\- They have THE global charging network. Opening that up is an instant cash cow of significant size\n\n\\- strictly from the stocks side:  Large institutional investors haven't even started adding Tesla to their portfolios due to it only being ranked \"investment grade\" a short time ago.\n\n.... and, most of all: Tesla has a customer base that is happy with the product to a degree that any other manufacturer could only dream of.\n\n(I probably could come up with some more reasons but that's just the ones that spring to mind.

There is no vaporware, that's either misinformation or misunderstanding. Maybe you can call some of these things \"moonshots\" but to call them vaporware is incorrect. Tesla itself was a moonshot, as was SpaceX. I don't know of any bad news, other than some people have very strong feelings about Musk. Meh, ho-hum. \nEven with the \"vaporware\" as you put it take a look at their earnings, cash, debt, growth rate, etc. I can see how some people may believe they're overvalued because they choose to look at Tesla as a traditional car company. Tesla isn't a traditional car company, and it's undervalued in my opinion. \nHistorically every industry upsetting new technology is disparaged. Tesla is no different.
