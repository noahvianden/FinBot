If wanted to stay in the tech sector, pretty much anyone else: GOOG, MSFT, AMZN, AAPL or a mega-cap heavy ETF if want to cut risk. Reasons why am not optimistic on Meta:\n\n1. Core Facebook product is becoming more of a barren wasteland each year\n2. Disasters like the leaked blind-eye-towards-increasing-suicides-for-young-people needs more that a name change rebrand to fix\n3. The mobile phone privacy clampdown crushes FB business model. The mobile phones aren’t going to undo that clampdown. Facebook already tried and failed to make its own phone\n4. Metaverse uptake too slow. By time it’s common, Google, Apple, MSFT will eat away at Meta share\n5. I don’t think Zuck will ever leave until it is too late to restore his company’s dominance\n6. Burry was long Meta earlier this year and even he folded when it continued to tank\n\nGood luck in the play, whichever way you end up going on it", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "I just saw an add on youtube for facebook.\n\nany questions?", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Meta will not exist in 10 years.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Who told you 🤯", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Easy change position to short, at least you will get something back.
