{"title": "TSLA is a ponzi scheme?", "selftext": "According to \"The Ponzi Factor,\" [https://theponzifactor.com/the-ponzi-factor-proof-by-definition/](https://theponzifactor.com/the-ponzi-factor-proof-by-definition/), companies like Google, Tesla and Berkshire-Hathaway are ponzi schemes. Why? Because none of them  provide dividends to their shareholders and \"therefore,\" can only supply value to their investors by receiving an influx of investments from new investors, which is the definition of a ponzi scheme (see [https://www.sec.gov/files/ia\\_virtualcurrencies.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/files/ia_virtualcurrencies.pdf) and [https://www.sec.gov/spotlight/enf-actions-ponzi.shtml](https://www.sec.gov/spotlight/enf-actions-ponzi.shtml)).\n\nThis (if the reasoning is to be believed) means that Berkshire-Hathaway has been running a ponzi scheme for the past 183 years. But companies like Google and Tesla do provide value to their investors because they provide value to their customers: they actually do something useful, unlike, say, Bernie Madoff. Likewise, Berkshire-Hathaway provides value to its investors by investing in companies which provide great value to their customers. So The Ponzi Factor's claim doesn't make sense since they (TSLA, et al) don't need new investments to provide value to their customers; they provide value inherently. In fact that's precisely why they attract new investors: they provide great value in the future to those investors who were willing to invest in them in the past. Otherwise BRK wouldn't still be attracting new investors 183 years after its inception.\n\nDoes anyone think that The Ponzi Factor's claims make any sense?
