I'll be honest, I have no idea what kind of profit margin I should assume. Like no idea. I don't think there are any profitable competitors that don't plan in other markets as well.\n\nIf I try to estimate by looking at companies in the Aerospace and Defense sectors, Profit Margins should probably  be between 6 and 12%. And I do reckon somewhat lower margins are probably correct, since these aren't exactly \"lightweight\" businesses.\n\nBut what I know is that if I use analysts estimates for revenue for this year, immediately have the company be  profitable (which absolutely no one expects), and then have it grow top-line consistently at 45-50% (again, which absolutely no professional expects) and give them a profit margin of 30% (which is way, way more than I'd assume if I wanted to be even just somewhat conservative). Then yeah, I guess I'd have the stock at fair value around 20, 22 bucks in 5 years (this is assuming a P/E of 35 as well, so a high P/E where people still expect substantial growth from there on. If all of these assumptions came true, yeah, the company would be a buy. But if I bet on that I might as well  buy a lottery ticket or bet my life savings on Real Madrid beating  Manchester City 11-1 tonight with Benzema scoring 7 goals exactly.\n\nIf I try to be just a tad more conservative and, frankly, probably a lot more realistic although - again, take everything with a grain of salt; this company  is so speculative that  educated guesses are barely possible, so just about every number I use has \"if that and that, then that\" behind  it and is as such quite weak as an argument - I try to mimic them not having positive earnings until 2024. So if I keep the growth rate of 50%  per year for 5 years, which I think is not a conservative but a very optimistic estimate by any means.\n\nI have them doing just very slightly better than the average analyst estimate in terms of earnings, then put them on a 10% profit margin where estimates end (all of this is in context of 50% top line growth - use less and you'll have to assume higher margins in order to get the same EPS of course) and a somewhat more moderated EPS, I'd get a buy price of around $2.90 for a 15% annual return (which is a lot lower than what I would go for with such a speculative play). Of course they do have a bit of cash right now, so I'd probably have to run some calcs where I give this some weight, but just eyeballing it it would probably come to a buy price of about 3 bucks as well.\n\nOf course, buy price is relative, and this assumes a somewhat moderated valuation which likely would not be the case if this company actually consistently grew 50% yoy with somewhat stable margins or even margin expansion.  If it turned out that way and that kind of growth was expected to continue for the  foreseeable future, they'd probably be trading at a P/E > 100 rather than a P/E of 25, 35 or 40.\n\nSo yeah, huge wall of text. TL;DR if it falls to 3 bucks I'll look at  it properly to see if it's worth taking up a speculative  position in my portfolio. In order to justify buying it at 7 bucks today I'd have to be confident that they grow at an  incredible rate consistently, have margins above 15% from 2025 onwards and will still trade at a P/E  above 50 in 5 years time.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Hey, want you to know I sincerely appreciate this response.

I also like the speed with which they expand their business (if you check their website they have a TON of new openings positions, they just built the new launch site, they bought up some some small companies that are space related and many more things). I don't know, this is just my opinion :)", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "1. Rocketlab is developing a bigger rocket, that will directly compete with F9 (or actually probably Starship which should replace Falcon)\n2. IF Rocketlab doesn't go into bigger rockets and stay only in the small payload market this means their current market valuation is even less attractive and share price would have to fall 3 times\n3. SpaceX not being a public company has nothing to do in them being competitors or not. Rocketlab is competing with some companies that are public and some other that are private\n4. SpaceX is launching small sats in ride-sharing missions. While this cannot provide the same value as dedicated launch for a big chunk of the clients it is acceptable and for them SpaceX and Rocketlab are direct competitors right now. I cannot understand how you could claim otherwise, even adding \"like at all\". They are not providing 100% the same service, true, but at the same time there is huge overlap, there are a lot of potential clients that are directly choosing between SpaceX and Rocketlab", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "1. Indeed they do. BUT. Assuming you are referring to Neutron, there is a big difference. I don't see them being able to compete with SpaceX on that, not yet atleast. Did you see the size of Starship and what it can already do (during their tests) ? That thing is huge. 3 times in size, 10 times heavier.\n2. I don't actually see the logic behind what you say. I'll admit that i don't know how i could determine their current valuation based on that fact alone (if they launch big or small payloads) but you didn't give any information at all either so i could also say that imo, them launching ONLY small payloads, their share price should rise 3 times. Why would their share price fall 3 times because of that (i'm just trying to say that without any other information, your statement is as true as mine).\n3. I was just saying that because you said you like what SpaceX does. Yea, me too. Love it. But as neither of us can invest in them, RKLB is the only alternative in the market atm, as they are actually launching stuff (big or small, doesn't matter).\n4. I agree, yes, there is overlap, but as i said, i think each of them has kind of their own customers, each having their share of the market, and the space industry is just getting started, and the possibilities are huge. I think they will be fine working side by side. And by the time others will join, they (and maybe a handful more) will already be really nice positioned. What i'm trying to say is that, they are not in a field where there are tons of companies overlaping, all of them trying to snatch a slice (what comes in mind now is all the companies that poped out when all the blockchain stuff exploded, all of them essentially trying to do the same thing. In that field, there is overlap and competition. A lot of it).\n\nPS.

Yea, we clearly have way different views about what competitive means in this scenario. Neutron will not compete with Starship because they are 2 different rockets, produced for doing different things, and i did not say that i would rather invest in spaceX, i said i love what they do.
