{"title": "The Uranium Papers", "selftext": "# A Short Introduction\n\nTo begin, I will give a brief summary of where we have been from the beginning of this year until now. Hopefully, this will catch you up to speed…should you wish to continue with this trade. I will also try to write this in both regular normal human tongue and in WSB degenerate lingo. For some of the especially smooth-brained imbeciles out there, I ran out of crayons months ago, I’ll try to include some pictures and smaller words out of common courtesy.\n\nFYI - I will be posting this on both Reddit and Twitter. I am not going to dive into every nook and cranny. I will also ask questions along the way for you to ponder. It will be tough for a lot of you, as it is written in such a way that a high schooler can understand...ironically the furthest education most of those reading this would have achieved. I recommend finding a few friends and combining the remaining brain cells you have to power through this...and preferably not someone that actually believes a trillion-dollar order could be filled.\n\nThis is going to be an overview and I have the utmost faith any questions you might have, can and will be answered by fellow Uranium Assholes - a term bestowed upon us by a dipshit who tweets homophobic slurs. But I digress. Let’s move on.\n\n# Background\n\nSince the beginning of the year, several events have transpired that have shaped the Uranium space. These are some of the main ones, as well as a telling clue as to why I believe this is going to be the trade to be in for the next 12-24 months. I will begin with the CCJ earnings call, as their next earnings call is on Thursday 5/5/2022…or more affectionately known as - Cameco de Mayo\n\n1. **CCJ earnings call** \\- Taken place on Feb 9th, we learned that Cameco had begun long-term contracts. Tim Gitzel (CEO), who is relatively mild-mannered and conservative during these calls, was noticeably much more bullish in tone than normal. He explained that they had termed out 30 million lbs of uranium in 2021, as well as improving fundamentals. Further explaining, that in January ALONE, they had added 40million lbs of long-term contracts…likely attributable to the unrest in Kazakhstan in January. They also announced that they would be restarting McArthur River and Key Lake Mill. Restarting these would only be done under one scenario…the bear market is over and the bull market had begun. This marked the turnaround of the Uranium stocks, which had since been in a large pullback. For those who do not know, this space is notorious for vicious pullbacks and ripping rallies…the latter is why I am writing this today. Take a quick look at all the stocks in the Uranium space for the days/weeks following that call…I would look closer at the ones that are the most easily investable and liquid, should Jim Cramer declare world peace and state a melt-up is coming…seriously, how that guy is actually allowed to talk and give financial advice is insane. Part of me thinks he takes his advice from David Hunter. Again, I digress…moving on.\n\nA quick summary of the call (\\~10 pages), the actual transcript (page 10 is the LT contracting piece) can be read below, as well as more in depth (90 minutes) actual call via the links below…total \\~100 pages and 90 minutes…how deep you want to go is up to you.\n\n[https://greenstocknews.com/news/nyse/ccj/cameco-announces-2021-financial-results-50-increase-to-2022-dividend-aligned-with-70-million-pounds-of-long-term-contracting-and-improving-market-fundamentals-next-phase-of-its-supply-discipline-begins-while-awaiting-further-market-improvements](https://greenstocknews.com/news/nyse/ccj/cameco-announces-2021-financial-results-50-increase-to-2022-dividend-aligned-with-70-million-pounds-of-long-term-contracting-and-improving-market-fundamentals-next-phase-of-its-supply-discipline-begins-while-awaiting-further-market-improvements)\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1009001/000119312522081448/d328590dex993.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1009001/000119312522081448/d328590dex993.htm)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.cameco.com/invest/events-presentations/2021-q4-conference-call-and-webcast](https://www.cameco.com/invest/events-presentations/2021-q4-conference-call-and-webcast)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. **Kazakhstan** \\- Around the beginning of January, civil unrest began to take place in Kazakhstan. This is of particular interest to Uranium investors, as a majority of the world’s uranium is mined there…approximately \\~40% (link below). This, along with other supply/demand fundamentals (will be brought up later), is likely why Cameco had such an insane earnings call, as well as many stocks doubling and nearly tripling since then. The unrest here is notable because the magnitude of how much this country contributes total uranium supply worldwide. It would be akin to OPEC oil supply being in question (\\~40%...link below). In fact, Russia had to come in and save the day from all the turmoil (more on that later). Now, if you were a utility company (who actually uses the uranium) and you have a risk management or fuel buying team, you probably are going to want to make sure you do not run into any supply disruptions that could screw you over. I would likely look to de-risk the scenario by diversifying why I obtained future uranium supply, signing long term contracts (You can count on one hand the actual amount of uranium producers out there…reminder, we are coming out of a BEAR market), and likely keeping a close eye on the situation moving forward.\n\nWhat would you do? Re-read the CCJ section above and I think you likely understand why all that LT contracting occurred. You can also watch over some of the interviews with their CEO Askar Batyrbayev around that time frame. They are not inspiring in confidence that the situation was fully resolved and disruptions would not be felt.\n\n[https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/mining-of-uranium/world-uranium-mining-production.aspx](https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/mining-of-uranium/world-uranium-mining-production.aspx)\n\n[https://www.eia.gov/finance/markets/crudeoil/supply-opec.php#:\\~:text=OPEC%20member%20countries%20produce%20about,the%20total%20petroleum%20traded%20internationally](https://www.eia.gov/finance/markets/crudeoil/supply-opec.php#:~:text=OPEC%20member%20countries%20produce%20about,the%20total%20petroleum%20traded%20internationally).\n\n1. **Ukraine and Russia** \\- Right after unrest in Kazakhstan, the Ukraine/Russia war began. Amongst many other commodities, this is of particular importance to the uranium space because of both Russia’s proximity to Kazakhstan (risk management and CSTO potentially dragging Kazakhstan into the conflict - a bit of a rabbit hole there…stick to the next bit) and Russia’s role in the world’s uranium enrichment process - accounting for nearly 40% of it. This is essentially the end product of uranium that nuclear reactors use (link and source of commentary from president of a nuclear fuel market analysis firm are below…only a few pages). Since this end product is exactly what nuclear reactors use, a disruption at this point of the fuel cycle can cause MASSIVE upstream effects… which is referred to as overfeeding. Rather than try to explain it here, there is a short video (20 minutes) that I will link below. It also includes Mark Nelson, a strong, well-spoken advocate for nuclear energy. He was also EXTREMELY active on Twitter during the Chernobyl FUD fiasco that took place when there was fighting around that reactor. MSM pumped up there could be another meltdown or nuclear accident…all for theatrical purposes IMO and it is a bunch of BS. New reactors are built to withstand more than bullets…in fact jets (link below)...I digress.\n\nWhether you watch the video or not, you should know that overfeeding basically means MORE uranium is needed to make the end product that nuclear reactors use…as we say in the uranium space NOT BEARISH\n\nIn degenerate terms - 1+1 =2 but in overfeeding, 1+1+1+1+1 = 2\n\nThis is about the most dumbed-down version I feel most of you will understand…because of your background at Wendys\n\nNormally, it takes 4 chicken tendies to make a 4-piece chicken tendie meal…now imagine it takes 10…or 12…or 16. That is a whole heck of a lot more chicken tendies that are going to be needed…this is almost about what it is like\n\nPS - you should watch the video … this guy’s mustache gives Ron Jeremys a run for the money\n\n[https://www.shovel-stocks.com/post/interview-the-nuclear-fuel-cycle-uranium-enrichment-mark-nelson-radiant-energy-fund-1-2](https://www.shovel-stocks.com/post/interview-the-nuclear-fuel-cycle-uranium-enrichment-mark-nelson-radiant-energy-fund-1-2)\n\n[https://www.marketplace.org/2022/03/30/russias-role-in-worlds-nuclear-energy-industry-prompts-calls-to-up-u-s-uranium-production/](https://www.marketplace.org/2022/03/30/russias-role-in-worlds-nuclear-energy-industry-prompts-calls-to-up-u-s-uranium-production/)\n\n[https://interestingengineering.com/crashed-jet-nuclear-reactor-test](https://interestingengineering.com/crashed-jet-nuclear-reactor-test)\n\nYou may have noticed that energy security is fast becoming a hot issue and that this war is not looking like it is going to resolve soon. There are numerous factors that are at play and continue to be at play from this war that is extremely bullish for this trade…each one could certainly be elaborated on but I am keeping this brief. In all likelihood, a majority of you probably could not make it past the first paragraph, let alone this point.\n\n* Sanctions - The US and others have been sanctioning Russia left and right. I joked that they were going to ban skull bongs with built-in police scanners at one point because of the dumb shit that they had been sanctioning IMO. However, with Congress back in session, Manchin (read: most powerful Democrat in Congress right now) has come out and supported a ban of Russian uranium. The act he supports also contains a strategic uranium reserve. There are a number of other listed proposed legislation with BIPARTISAN support all around. Links are below - the full text of all of these is in the hundreds\n* **Sanction update - As I update this (5/3), the EU is looking to involve Uranium in the most recent round of sanctions this current week - this announcement could occur as early as Wednesday (today).** \n* Question to ponder - With midterms right around the corner and a full-blown energy crisis underway (been to the pump lately?), things are going to get worse before they get better (See Youtube video below for visual representation). The everything-is-Putin’s fault card is already being played…in fact, he was blamed for crazy blowout inflation numbers (CPI)...even when the numbers reported could not have possibly included Putin because the war had not even started. If the energy crisis is already fully underway (irrespective of who is at fault), it would be easy to score political brownie points by being anti-Russia with anything.\n* Question 1- Think of the backlash that could occur prior to midterms if your opponent comes out as anti-Russia and says you aren’t supporting the now bipartisan bills they are putting out against Russia…does that look good on MSM and at the polls?\n* Question 2 - Manchin is the cog that makes the Build Back Better bill actually pass - his voice matters more than most…and he’s the ranking member of the Energy Committee - he’s publicly for a ban on Russian Uranium and he is pro-nuclear…think that Biden and Co might want to appease him for that vote with some easy concessions?\n\n[https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/4064/text](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/4064/text)\n\n[https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/3978/cosponsors?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22uranium%22%2C%22uranium%22%5D%7D&r=2&s=2](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/3978/cosponsors?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22uranium%22%2C%22uranium%22%5D%7D&r=2&s=2)\n\n​​[https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/7222/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22uranium%22%2C%22uranium%22%5D%7D&r=4&s=1](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/7222/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22uranium%22%2C%22uranium%22%5D%7D&r=4&s=1)\n\n [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/03/europe-prepares-fresh-russia-sanctions-as-us-warns-moscow-plans-to-annex-parts-of-east-ukraine](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/03/europe-prepares-fresh-russia-sanctions-as-us-warns-moscow-plans-to-annex-parts-of-east-ukraine)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xi22Vkie7EM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xi22Vkie7EM)\n\n1. **SWU**  \\- We have begun to see the effects of Russian bans on the enrichment cycle - clearly, folks are moving away from them…and in doing so, costs are going to go up…I think this is best explained in the video I will link below.\n\nI highly recommend you read and watch the video from Uranium Insider below starting at the 8:25 mark. This explains the enrichment story unfolding…there was a jump from $72 …to…$120. Which, I believe, is one of, if not, the greatest jump in price EVER.\n\nThis price is a leading indicator of the future SPOT price of Uranium.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPZqG\\_WarG8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPZqG_WarG8)\n\nWhether the aforementioned sanctions occur or not, de-facto ones are already in place. It is clear that a move away from Russian sourced enrichment fuel is here. In fact, Urenco USA was just starting to post that they are looking to hire more folks…they are involved in supplying enrichment services and fuel cycle products in the USA\n\nThat is essentially a shortened version of 2022 in the Uranium space. If you want some videos to watch, I linked below the Youtube video to Uranium Insider where I think you should start watching. I would avoid watching the price action and just grab the daily updates to have the story told to you a little more in-depth than the writings above. The episode is 58…there are now 112 of them. I estimate this is likely a good 10+ hours of content for you to watch, depending on if you want to see the price action and commentary on that as well.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZBlnk1yph4&t=659s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZBlnk1yph4&t=659s)\n\nFor a more in depth in-depth look at what has been going on, I suggest you check out some of Napalm's work. He has A LOT of content/posts and he is quite descriptive. Bring some coffee. The link below to one of them.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/UraniumSqueeze/comments/ths6ri/the\\_latest\\_signes\\_of\\_operational\\_license/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UraniumSqueeze/comments/ths6ri/the_latest_signes_of_operational_license/)\n\nFor a shit post that describes a bit of this…he is a video I put together…great for those that have difficulties with words that have more than a few syllables\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/u612ck/an\\_easter\\_meme\\_for\\_u\\_degenerates/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/u612ck/an_easter_meme_for_u_degenerates/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n# New Builds, Extensions, and Restarts\n\nThis section is going to go over just what the title states. We will begin with what we know and move toward the more opaque situations.\n\n1. **New Builds** \\- There are several stories coming out here but the main ones of interest a the moment should be from China, France,  India, the UK, and India.\n\nChina announced plans to construct 150 new reactors - they obviously believe their future is going to run with nuclear power.\n\nFrance - Macron won the election…he is ditching plans to close down 12 reactors and potentially increase the new building of 14 reactors.\n\nIndia is going to build 10 new reactors over the next three years\n\nThe UK is planning on 8 new reactor builds - they are planning on adding an additional one each year until the year 2030.\n\nSouth Korea - the recent election saw a pro-nuclear president take office…they play on resuming the building of two new ones and reactivating of suspended ones.\n\nSomething to ponder - With everything going on in the Uranium world and world in general, what do you think countries that are going to spend HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS of $$$ on new reactors are going to do to the Uranium market. My guess is that as commodities grow more and more scarce/in demand, energy becomes more and more valuable, I believe that they will begin to stockpile strategic reserves. Most nuclear reactors, typically store a few years' supply out in advance. Those current supplies are now dwindling and restocking is going to be needed. I think the near-term builders will scoop up supply and the more savvy Chinese (with their five-year plans and 4D chess moves) will stockpile it in mass quantities.\n\nWhat would you do in this case to ensure your hundreds of billions of dollars worth of nuclear reactor investment was able to be put to use…buy in advance…or wait around with all this news swirling about?\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-11-02/china-climate-goals-hinge-on-440-billion-nuclear-power-plan-to-rival-u-s](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-11-02/china-climate-goals-hinge-on-440-billion-nuclear-power-plan-to-rival-u-s)\n\n[https://www.montelnews.com/news/1315204/macron-wins-election-vows-to-boost-nuclear-renewables](https://www.montelnews.com/news/1315204/macron-wins-election-vows-to-boost-nuclear-renewables)\n\n[https://www.cnet.com/science/why-the-us-should-learn-from-chinas-nuclear-power-expansion/](https://www.cnet.com/science/why-the-us-should-learn-from-chinas-nuclear-power-expansion/)\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/doosan-heavy-rallies-on-nuclear-energy-hopes-under-new-south-korean-president-271646987413?mod=newsviewer\\_click](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/doosan-heavy-rallies-on-nuclear-energy-hopes-under-new-south-korean-president-271646987413?mod=newsviewer_click)\n\n[https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61010605#:\\~:text=It%20also%20confirmed%20advanced%20plans,nuclear%20reactors%2C%20or%20possibly%20both](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61010605#:~:text=It%20also%20confirmed%20advanced%20plans,nuclear%20reactors%2C%20or%20possibly%20both).\n\n1. **Extensions** \\- There are some extensions listed above but we can look at the ones that are specific to the US here. The Department of Energy is planning on spending $6 billion to prevent nuclear power plants from closing down. There are several around the USA that have the public’s eye. I will mention Palisades and Diablo here.\n\nHere is the connect the dots part of this DD…Palisades is a nuclear reactor that is located in Michigan. Our current Secretary of Energy is Jennifer Granholm - former two-term governor of Michigan who is pro-nuclear energy. Palisades just applied for federal aid to help prevent the shutdown. That shutdown is supposed to occur in late May, barring intervention.\n\nWhat do you think might occur here?\n\nIf there is more interest, Michigan is near and dear to my heart. I would be willing to follow up on this with another post. I digress.\n\nThe other reactors in the US I believe that will see extensions are…every single one that applies for aid. The main reasons these were shutdown were from cheaper natural gas (which lately has been going limit up), costs of major repairs (federal aid alleviates this), and operating losses due to cheaper electricity prices (not anymore). The writing on the wall for the US right now is a green and electric future…to be paid for in part by US taxpayers.\n\nAs I am writing this, there was a major development in the state of California. Diablo Canyon, California’s last remaining nuclear power plant may be seeing an extension.\n\nI have placed two links below to this news. Admittedly, I know more about the Palisades situation than the Diablo Canyon one. As such, I would encourage you to follow the few folks that have been in the trenches in regard to this situation for years upon years.\n\nVia Twitter, they have some excellent recent threads and thoughts on this situation. Far more in-depth than I will go here.\n\nMark Nelson u/energybants\n\nChris Keefer u/Dr_keefer\n\nIsabelle u/isabelleboemeke\n\nMichael Shellenberger u/ShellenbergerMD (one great thread on it…lots of political talk too…not going to go into where I stand with everything, just stating he had a solid thread on this matter - no more, no less.)\n\nMoving forward…\n\nHere is a thought to ponder - How are we going to power all these new electric vehicles without nuclear energy in the United States (and the world)?\n\nConsider this - the sun does not always shine, the wind does not always blow (and sometimes when it does, it kills hundreds of bald eagles), and water doesn’t always flow for hydro…shit, sometimes these things just go straight to the shitter (Read: Texas winter when wind turbines froze…and people were without power…in the ENERGY CAPITAL OF THE USA)\n\n[https://www.utilitydive.com/news/doe-to-offer-6-billion-to-keep-struggling-nuclear-reactors-online/618919/#:\\~:text=The%20Department%20of%20Energy%20](https://www.utilitydive.com/news/doe-to-offer-6-billion-to-keep-struggling-nuclear-reactors-online/618919/#:~:text=The%20Department%20of%20Energy%20)(DOE,of%20intent%20published%20last%20week.\n\n[https://www.hollandsentinel.com/story/news/local/2022/04/20/whitmer-wants-save-palisades-nuclear-plant-lake-michigan-shore/7376628001/](https://www.hollandsentinel.com/story/news/local/2022/04/20/whitmer-wants-save-palisades-nuclear-plant-lake-michigan-shore/7376628001/)\n\n[https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2022-04-29/california-promised-to-close-its-last-nuclear-plant-now-newsom-is-reconsidering](https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2022-04-29/california-promised-to-close-its-last-nuclear-plant-now-newsom-is-reconsidering)\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/29/newsom-offers-hope-for-californias-last-nuclear-plant-diablo-canyon.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/29/newsom-offers-hope-for-californias-last-nuclear-plant-diablo-canyon.html)\n\n1. **Restarts** \\- The two biggest countries with restarts on the tablet right now are Germany and Japan. I will begin with Germany.\n\nAs eluded to above, the electrification of the world is not going to happen with wind, solar, hydro, etc. alone. Nuclear is going to play a massive role in it. A fact, that I do not believe escaped Elon Musk, as he recently tweeted out - See below\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4pzu1dl1rgx81.png?width=764&format=png&auto=webp&s=74ac346465811b66797fb73748d06e4dd15d9312\n\nIt is incredibly obvious that 24/7 power generation to supply the grid and all these new electric vehicles are going to be needed as part of the power mix. He understands this quite well and is advocating for Germany to restart their last nuclear reactors…and in essence, call for an extension of another few.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI believe given the state of the energy crisis Germany and the rest of the EU are experiencing, as well as the war (Ukraine/Russia), this is not going to ease up anytime soon.  Recent headlines have started surfacing of Germany extending the life of these three reactors, as well as restarts. While I think this is the absolutely correct move, I am not going to hold my breath here. Yes, this is rather bearish but needs to be mentioned. I do also believe that if push comes to shove, they will look at extensions.\n\nJapan - I am MUCH more confident in Japanese restarting as many of the other 23 reactors that are currently offline as possible. For starters, they restarted one in 2021. The option is clearly on the table. Furthermore, all of the news that has come out of Japan in the past month or two has been non-stop PRO-NUCLEAR. The new Prime Minister is for it, the citizens/popular sentiment is trending that way, and the recent blackout in Tokyo has clearly shifted the thought process to reexamining how to fast-track this process.\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-23/japan-restarts-first-nuclear-reactor-since-2018-amid-hurdles](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-23/japan-restarts-first-nuclear-reactor-since-2018-amid-hurdles)\n\n[https://www.cnet.com/science/japans-new-pm-wants-to-restart-nuclear-power-in-the-country/](https://www.cnet.com/science/japans-new-pm-wants-to-restart-nuclear-power-in-the-country/)\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-28/most-japanese-back-nuclear-power-for-first-time-since-fukushima](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-28/most-japanese-back-nuclear-power-for-first-time-since-fukushima)\n\n[https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQODK282XU0Y2A420C2000000/](https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQODK282XU0Y2A420C2000000/)\n\nAt the risk of losing your attention span, even more, I will wrap it up here. If there is an appetite for more information in this space, I will provide it.  Following the art of the DD, which frankly every post here should strive to do, I believe I have touched on climate, and story, and will now speak (briefly) on technicals, as they are not my strong suit.\n\n​​[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/6j6gri/the\\_art\\_of\\_the\\_dd\\_for\\_beginners/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/6j6gri/the_art_of_the_dd_for_beginners/)\n\n# Technical Analysis\n\nNot by any means my strong suit. I tend to follow 50-200 DMA golden/death crosses as well as hammer patterns. I am a simple bloke when it comes to this space. If you enjoy this type of thing and are interested in a more in-depth look, here are some folks that tend to do a pretty decent job in the space.\n\nJohn - Twitter handle is u/Jhinster1\n\nScott - Twitter handle is u/U_Ag_\n\nAndy - Finding Value Finance (Youtube channel as well) - Twitter handle is u/finding_finance\n\nEast West - Twitter Handle is u/EastWest_advice\n\nIn lieu of technical analysis, here is a list of folks that have come out with comments ranging from anywhere between pro-nuclear to extremely bullish - in no particular order…there’s certainly more, and I am sure you have no heard of half of these names, but I respect them, so I will mention them.\n\nLarry McDonald - Kuppy - ChiGirl - Joshy Young - Happy Hawaiin - Lobo T - Elon Musk - Burry - LeadLag (twittername) - Jeff Clark - Bill Gates - Gwen Preston - Stansberry Research - Doomsberg - Patrick Ceresna - Robert Kietz - Lyn Alden - Trader Ferg - Trader Stewie - Lookingforhiddenvalue - Yellowbull - Antonio Atanasv -\n\n# Fundamentals\n\nThis should be an entirely separate DD for each individual company, as well as proof of positions. I am open to doing that but it is beyond the scope of this particular post. I will note that the whole space lit up during the last CCJ earnings call. Their bullishness (or bearishness) speaks for all in this space, as there are so few active producers. I am also open to diving deeper into this section as well.\n\nI think given the recent pullback, this is an excellent time to look for an entry into this space. I’m not advocating to go portfolio deep (translation - don’t YOLO everything like some other morons have been doing recently…WOW the posts and loss porn these past few days). I do think if some of you moved to put 10-20% of your portfolio outside of what you normally are trading (read: GME, AMC, TESLA…and if you have not been margin called yet, WISH, CLOV, UWMC, SNDL, etc. etc.) into various commodities (Read: uranium, oil, wheat, corn, and others of the like), we might not be seeing as much insane loss porn here.\n\nPlease note, I rarely, if ever, buy FDs or options expiring in 60 days or less. I tend to be a net seller of those. In an extremely volatile space like this one, you do NOT need to be extremely aggressive to find leverage. LEAPS work just well for me.\n\nIf there is a dip on Wednesday (FED can really blow up or rocket anything at this point), I will look at adding some shorter CCJs…as well as some other companies in the space. Since it is so small, I cannot actually post anything on them here without it getting removed. \n\nThis DD has \\~15 pages worth of content…well over 100 if you actually look at the links, and more than 10 hours of audio/visual content as well.\n\nLastly, none of this should be construed as financial advice. This is the best current trade on my screen (oil is a second). Worthy of note, I have been wrong before. I will be wrong again. There are many Jim Henson worthy ass muppets out there that claim to have a flawless track record in the Uranium space. They are TRUE assholes. Watch out for those clowns...they are fairly easy to spot, as some do not wear shirts, some are allergic to sunlight and may or may not live in Castlevania, and some just have the absolutely biggest egos on the planet.\n\nCheers and best of luck with whatever you do", "id": "ui6xsj", "created_utc": 1651671925.0, "score": 103, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 76, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|24|**First Seen In WSB**|2 years ago\n**Total Comments**|84|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q0x3xo/small_wordsbig_pictures/) [x](https://v.redd.it/whnmnf2xw5u81) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ui6ank/the_uranium_papers/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ui6o2o/the_uranium_papers/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ui6xsj/the_uranium_papers/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r0dmn8/buy_low_sell_high/) \n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=ui6xsj)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=ui6xsj)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Glad someone here is also watching the yellow cake, great DD!", "score": 23, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you - It’s certainly flying under the radar right now…hopefully for not too much longer though!", "score": 12, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "This is one of the best overall explanations for the U sector!

{"title": "Shopify will sink like a rock", "selftext": "Shop earnings are scheduled AH and they'll tank. Just looking at their previous earnings, they were all pumped up by their stakes in two companies: Global-e , and Affirm, both these companies are publicly traded so it's easy to predict Shopify bottom line, they both lost more than 30% of value in the last 3 months.\n\nShopify posted a net profit of 2.9 billion in 2021, all of it came from these two investment, that are currently tanking. \n\nNeglecting Shopify investments, the company net profit was less than half a billion, now that's a lot, but the company is valued at 50 billion right now, it is overvalued. \n\nTo break down Shopify business numbers and try to predict their Q1 earnings we'll rely on two factors:\n\n1- their investments: comfortably predicting that number will be negative\n\n2- their core business, coming out of covid high growth, and looking at Netflix subscription numbers, and amazon e-commerce numbers, we can predict that their subscription numbers are down from previous quarter and from previous year. Beside their shops subscriptions they have a category of \"e-commerce\" services that include various services they offers to shops owners including payment Solutions, this segment pulled 1 billion in revenue last quarter, and it it the most promising part of the growth story.\n\nShopify doubled their work force in 2021, this bad news, because they will weigh in on their expenses in a period where key growth metrics will be slowing down significantly or even going negativite, in these environment a lot of companies including Meta, Netflix, peloton...etc are slowing down their spending and firing large numbers of employees.\n\nShopify has around half a billion in cash that it said it's using to further devolop their investments and products, but we can assume that none of these investments will translate into revenue or profits in this quarter earnings, as these kinds of investments take many quarters or several years to generate a return.\n\nSo to sum it up, Shopify has around 10% in Global-e, and 10% in affirm, both went down last quarter, this will translate to more than a billion dollars losses for the company, their net profit from their core business will be in the negative no doubt, with macro-economic shit putting significant pressure on it. The only upside for investors hoping for an upside (or at least avoiding a panic selling) is that Shopify is 70% owned by institutions that can wait it out and not panic sell, and for them (and even retail) to not pay attentions to significant unrealized losses on their investments and focusing only on the griowth story of their core business.", "id": "uiboay", "created_utc": 1651684823.0, "score": 60, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 75, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|5|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|235|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|4 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=uiboay)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=uiboay)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I just yoloed my life savings into weekly otm calls on Shopify.

Also, higher interest rates mean Q2 will be worse!\n\nPowell says neutral rate is 2%-3% in an economy with 2% inflation. But we are not in an economy with 2% inflation. We have official inflation of 9% and actually inflation much higher than that. Yet Powell refuses to state what's neutral in our high-inflation economy!\n\nWhy do people insist the inflation we have today is not as bad as the inflation of the 1970s, when it's actually worse when measured using the same CPI? Worse still is that now we have much more debt. So this inflation fight will do far more collateral damage to the economy!\n\nWhy is the Fed raising interest rates so slowly? If it thinks a 2.5% Fed Funds rate is appropriate, why not just move rates to that level right now? If rates are too low, the longer they remain too low the more damage they will do to the economy.
