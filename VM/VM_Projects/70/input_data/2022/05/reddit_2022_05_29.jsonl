This meant leading large-cap stocks, such as those making up the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and what he called, \"high-grade bonds,\" which today we might call, \"investment-grade.\" \n\nA defensive investor should trade very little, seeking only to maintain their asset allocation in response to market fluctuations, and the periodic addition of funds from one's paycheck. \n\nThe advice for enterprising investors in the book was much less straight-forward, because the roads to excess returns in any given period are not straight-forward; they vary considerably based on circumstances at the time, and available opportunities. Graham briefly addresses strategies such as merger-arbitrage, which his Graham-Newman fund used with success in its early history. Incidentally, this strategy became very popular in the 1980s and led to many high-level cases of insider-trading in that decade -- read Jame's Stewart's, \"Den of Thieves,\" (1992) for more details. The trouble with active strategies in general, however, is that once the competition learns about them the excess returns tend to disappear, so an enterprising investor is constantly needing to adjust their strategy in search of new sources of alpha. In broad terms then, Graham stated that an enterprising investor is one who is equipped with the proper analytical tools and temperament to reach an independent valuation of virtually any asset, and as such, is able to determine when a security of apparently-inferior quality to the market leaders may, in fact, be undervalued by the market, and thus ripe for revaluation higher once everyone else figures that out. In this sense, the active or enterprising investor might look for undervalued companies among the lower-quality end of the market and hope to earn a higher returns than by simply buying-and-holding the highest quality assets at premium prices.\n\nSo to return to your question, I think if you're a defensive investor who doesn't have the analytical training to value a company's assets and cash-flows, you're almost always better off sticking with the highest quality companies in the market, even if those companies come with a premium valuation. The reason other posters have suggested using index funds for this purpose is because this is the simplest and easiest-to-scale method for carrying out this kind of operation for the vast majority of individual savers. You could conceivably purchase shares in the largest 30-50 stocks in the market, the way defensive investors in Graham's day would have done it, but why bother when you could simply purchase an index fund and achieve the same result?  \n\nIf you want to become an enterprising investor, then you'll want to learn the techniques of valuation so you can come to an independent judgment of an asset's worth. How else will you be able to judge if a security is actually \"cheap,\" rather than fairly priced, it you can't value the security? You can't just look at a few publicly-available statistics and from that alone determine that an asset is cheap or expensive, because everyone else is looking at the same things and pricing the asset accordingly. You have to come to an independent view about what the asset is worth; that view needs to be different from the market's, making the security mispriced; and that view ultimately needs to be correct in the way you expect. In markets with many intelligent competitors with large budgets, such as the US equity market, this is very difficult to do. You can try it, of course, but if you do so, you should have a thorough understanding of the techniques of valuation, and a willingness to work quite hard, because that is what your competition is doing every day. \n\nIn my view then, if you don't know how to independently value a company's assets and cash-flows, that's fine; but you should probably be a defensive investor, and the simplest way of doing that today is by purchasing an index fund for minimal fees. If you're well-trained in the techniques of valuation, however, and don't mind spending your time analyzing securities, then you might find excellent returns for relatively low risk among the lists of the second and third-rate issues. Good luck.", "score": 19, "replies": []}, {"body": "Probably best to read and learn a lot before picking. There is no definitive answer to your question. Or, well, the answer is \"It depends\".\n\nIf a company trades at a higher P/E multiple than it's competitors, but is expected to far exceed their performance for years and years to come, it might not actually be overvalued by those expectations, even if it's seemingly trading rich.\n\nLikewise, there can be reasons for a company trading cheap. It can be actually undervalued but it's also possible that there are issues with the company, concerns over the future performance, their finances, whatever.\n\nSo if you wanna pick stocks, do just that. Look at the companies, one after the other, and try to figure out where they are going and what expectations are, what the sentiment is, how execution has been and so on. Then come up with a fair valuation according to the assumptions you make and determine where the company should be trading in X years if your assumptions are correct. From that price and the current price you can determine an expected rate of return. By doing that, you can determine which company you expect to be the best deal.\n\nOnce you've done your DD, feel free to share it here. People will read it, some will comment to criticise mistakes or point out what you might have missed. With that, you'll likely have a better overall picture.\n\nYou can't say that this or that is better in general. You gotta look at every company individually if you wanna be a successful stock picker. My personal opinion is that people often overpay a lot because a company is the leader in their sector, and that this often diminishes their return. There can, however, be a sensible premium on leaders at times that still make them the better buy even if they are trading somewhat rich compared to others in the sector.\n\nAnd be aware that successful stockpicking is hard.
