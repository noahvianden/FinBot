{"title": "Report: Ads Could Boost Netflix Revenue 21%", "selftext": "https://www.mediaplaynews.com/report-ads-could-boost-netflix-revenue-21/\n\nWith Netflix planning to launch an ad-supported subscription option by the fourth quarter, a new report suggests the move could generate a 21% spike in the streamer‚Äôs annual revenue. The company reported $3.35 billion in North American fiscal 2021 revenue, which was up from $3 billion in FY 2020 revenue.\n\nNetflix currently charges $9.99 monthly for the basic plan, $15.49 monthly for the standard plan, and a $19.99 monthly for the premium plan.\n\nThe Information, citing data from SVOD competitors employing ad-supported options, contends Netflix would have to charge less when subjecting streamers to targeted ads. How much less remains to be seen.\n\nAssisting Netflix in the ad-revenue generation would be its scale of subscribers. The service currently has about 221 million subscribers, including 74.5 million in North America. That‚Äôs more than HBO Max, Paramount+, discovery+ and Peacock combined.\n\nHulu reportedly subjects streamers to the most ads per hour, while Paramount+ streams 50% fewer commercials than Hulu, according to Paramount Global CFO Naveen Chopra speaking at a recent investor event. HBO Max streams fewer ads as well.\n\n‚Äú[Ad-supported subscription streaming] gives us the ability to package what is becoming increasingly scarce linear inventory with digital video inventory, which is a way to differentiate that inventory versus what some other platforms will be able to offer,‚Äù Chopra said.", "id": "uw5jb1", "created_utc": 1653326978.0, "score": 22, "upvote_ratio": 0.62, "num_comments": 70, "comments": [{"body": "I think they‚Äôre better off adding porn subscriptions", "score": 115, "replies": [{"body": "It sounds like a joke but this honestly would be big if they were willing to get into it", "score": 26, "replies": [{"body": "No one pays for porn....plus, angry spouses wondering why netflix shows up", "score": -3, "replies": [{"body": "yea, nobody pays for porn because people don't tell anyone", "score": 21, "replies": []}, {"body": "How do porn companies make money anyway?
