{"title": "ATTN: All Gay Bears That got Wiped Out This Week", "selftext": "Hello. Long time WSBer and 100% shit poster. I felt I needed to send a message to the bears in this sub that got wrecked this week. \n\nIf you are a bear and obliterated your account this week after 5 months of casino dealers throwing black chips at you, you need to look in the mirror and poor shame the person you see.\n\nBeing a permabear in this environment means you believe the economy is in the shithole and that we are likely to see an 08 style crash. (I don't believe it will be on this level but ok) Why the hell would you throw down your entire portfolio on 0DTEs? I know this is a casino but do you really want to be the guy with rolled up chinos in the Bellagio fountain picking up pennies? Grab 3-5 puts dated 2-3 months from now, not 200 0DTES.\n\nTom Lee said it best: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ys5NlAoI2HA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ys5NlAoI2HA) keyword: Violent. Yes we had a violent drop in the market the past few weeks, but the bull rally is just as violent. And yes, the bull will impale your girlfriend.\n\nTLDR: Down 24k for the week. Half was due to ER FDs. (Still a gambler at heart) The rest are longer dated Spy puts and Amazon puts currently red. Up 390% overall since Dec 21. Current active positions Amazon $2000p, $1800p 6/17 \n\nStop yoloing yourself into thin air. The Squid Games are more fun with more players but most of you can't even get past the green light red light game.
