One day market is up , then it wipes out previous gain and then some. \n\nThen when so.e screamed it's the bottom, real pain came for \nGood tech names , I remember AMZN was at $100 , then it around $36 .

Well, that went to shit few days ago after company reported earning ...  sales up 9% ,  net earnings are down 55% from same quarter a year ago. They barried net loss under reporting bureaucracy and stock went up . So you really had to read in to the numbers. \n\nI wasn't surprised,  because categories I was making 30% gross profit on, now I making like 1%... but labor cost went up like crazy, I m paying retards with a heart beat $5 more per hour from last year, and they got way less brain power then bfr . \n\nWell, make ur own conclusions from this shit post.
