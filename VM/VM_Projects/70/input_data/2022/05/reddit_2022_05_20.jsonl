Roku is selling the shovels to the streaming gold rush. Every streaming service has to give Roku a cut of their subscription revenue just to be on their platform. So, as the overall streaming industry grows bigger which it will, it doesn't matter which individual service is the leader since Roku will be collecting a cut of the revenue from all of them. In addition, Roku has a great ad business, and they collect tons of data about customer preferences across all of the streaming services and that data is very valuable to advertisers. It is also valuable for use internally to help them deliver the content that people want as they grow their own streaming service into yet another source of revenue.\n\nRoku also gets the competition fears with people thinking that Apple, Google, and Amazon are going to hurt Roku.
