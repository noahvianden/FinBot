{"title": "Putting Cramer on the record: He thinks inflation is peaking", "selftext": "[Cramer is making two major points](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/05/investing-club-were-not-panicking-cramer-sees-inflation-peaking-looks-for-stock-buys.html). Wanted to take everyone's opinion on this.\n\nFirst point is that today's sell off is caused by 10 year yield rising above 3%, which triggered algorithms to start selling stocks.\n\n>Bond investors are likely selling their holdings, Cramer suggested, because they believe Powell was wrong to say the Fed is “not actively considering” a 75 basis point hike while the economy faces its hottest bout of inflation since the early 1980s. The bond market moves are, in turn, triggering stock sales by algorithmic traders, Cramer said.\n\nI'm not quite sure what Cramer is saying here. Is he saying that bond holders don't believe Powell will restrict himself from doing a 75 basis raise? Or is he saying that bond holders think 50 basis raises won't be enough and inflation will kill the bond prices in the future?\n\nSecond point is probably a controversial prediction: Cramer believes inflation is peaking, and that in 3 months things will look very different. He lists as examples (some of this is not covered in the article but I heard him say this on TV):\n\n* Cooper and aluminum prices dropping.\n* Good rain in US benefiting Soy Beans and also wheat prices going down.\n* Car prices new and old coming down.\n* Mortgage rate will cool demand.\n* The only thing that will not go down is oil.\n\nI know how people feel about Cramer, but if possible would like to hear your take on this based on substance and not just \"lol Cramer sucks.\" I'm not saying he doesn't suck, it's just that regardless of who the messenger is, these are just starting points for discussion so let's just stipulate that yes you hate him but let's dissect his points.
