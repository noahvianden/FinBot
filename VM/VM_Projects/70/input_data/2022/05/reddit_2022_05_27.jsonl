{"title": "Summer rally ‘bandwagon’ is growing, say BofA strategists, may represent a \"tradable bounce\"", "selftext": "In previous posts this week, I described how there is a generally a brief summer rally that can start at any time if seasonal market patterns hold this year. (Now whether there is a Summer rally this year, and/or it turns out to be a bear market rally or brief bounce, depends on a lot of geopolitical & supply chain issues that are random factors at this point). \n\nThere have been three catalysts for bulls' attempt to find footing this week as the market consolidates at just above the level at which the S&P would enter a bear market: \n\n* Biden suggesting early this week that the (inflationary) tariffs regime may be lifted,   \n* the release of the Fed meeting minutes Wednesday that confirmed no rate hikes > 1/2% are being considered, and   \n* strong earnings reports in the past 2 days from some retailers after an initially depressing set of earnings reports from Walmart & Target sent markets tumbling and a good April report of inflation-adjusted consumer spending has eased near-term recession fears   \n* today it was reported that inflation appears to have slowed to around 6.3% in April  \n\nIt's important to note here that the week long rally I'm describing has been selective. In US equities, industrial stocks, pharmaceuticals, materials and other real economy sectors have had a run of 5 days of gains in a row. Tech/growth stocks may pause in their correction and catch a lift from the consolidation in these other sectors, or they may not. But there has also appeared a new bout of so-called \"dip buying\" that appears to be favoring global assets, including foreign stocks & bonds after analysts cut ratings on \"developed markets\" as the EU & emerging markets have developed into deep value plays since being dragged into the US selloff. \n\nWith that context, \n\n[**Dip Buyers Storm Back to Stocks After Selloff** Investors add about $20 billion to global equity funds in week; Summer rally ‘bandwagon’ is growing, say BofA strategists](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-27/stock-funds-see-biggest-inflows-in-10-weeks-as-dip-buyers-return)\n\n> Global equity funds saw their biggest inflows in 10 weeks, led by US stocks, as cheaper valuations lured buyers after a steep selloff on recession fears.\n\n> Investors added about $20 billion to global stocks in the week to May 25, led by inflows into the US, according to Bank of America Corp.’s note citing EPFR Global data. Cash led the inflows among asset classes with about $28 billion, signaling market participants continue to search for havens. Bond fund outflows reached $5.8 billion. \n\n> Equities have staged a recovery this week, with the US and European indexes heading for their biggest weekly advance since mid-March as investors bought the dip after strong declines. Citigroup Inc. strategists this week recommended stepping back into stocks, particularly in Europe and emerging markets, on their appealing valuations, while cutting their recommendation on US stocks to neutral\n\n> Still, strategists remain divided on whether the selloff has found a bottom, with the likes of Morgan Stanley and Bank of America saying that there may be more losses to come, while BlackRock cut developed market stocks to neutral this week. \n\n> “Summer rally bandwagon is growing,” Bank of America strategists led by Michael Hartnett wrote in the note. “We fade rallies, but not in a rush.” \n\n> Assets including US 30-year Treasuries, Chinese and German stocks, US banks and technology, European industrials as well as consumer stocks in the US, Europe and China are among the most oversold assets relative to their 200-day moving average and “vulnerable to tradable bounce,” the strategists said.\n\n_________________\n\nDisclosures:\n\nI am currently mostly allocated to commodities & commodity related cyclical stocks, including foreign miners & shipping stocks and have recently added significant Latin American exposure. I have almost zero allocation to tech/growth at this time.\n\nIn my portffolios, my positioning reflects my belief that the overall market indexes will continue to fall due to inflated assets, despite any short term rallies, but I do constantly trade near term events.\n\nI'm not advocating for a bull or a bear, because I don't trade on broad market indexes, but I feel it's important for investors to understand both sides of a trade.", "id": "uyvzi6", "created_utc": 1653650231.0, "score": 97, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 70, "comments": [{"body": "Not buying it, institutions want someone to dump on before QT starts next week.\n\nThe real economy has only gotten worse in April/May.", "score": 113, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 54, "replies": [{"body": "Fed tried back in 2018, and they had to stop because the market was starting to crash.\n\nI don't know why this time would be any different since it's even faster and they can't back down as quickly.", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 35, "replies": [{"body": "> Most of us on this sub forget that the vast majority of Americans do not invest. \n\nThis is [not true, over half of Americans own stocks](https://news.gallup.com/poll/266807/percentage-americans-owns-stock.aspx). \n\n> The stat is actually 69% of Americans can't access $1,000 even in an emergency.\n\nThis is *also* not true and is one of the most wildly misinterpreted and widely misreported statistics on the internet. What happened was people were polled to ask **how** they would cover a $1,000 emergency. And *anyone* who didn’t say they’d just use savings, was for some reason assumed to be *incapable* of paying the emergency with savings. For example, [in this survey 39% said they’d just pay it with savings](https://www.bankrate.com/banking/savings/financial-security-january-2021/), and so all of the “I’d use a credit card” and “I’d pay it but cut down on other expenses” people are assumed to be incapable of paying $1,000. A year later Bankrate conducted another survey, and this time [44% said they’d use savings and 20% said they’d use a credit card](https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2022/01/19/56percent-of-americans-cant-cover-a-1000-emergency-expense-with-savings.html).\n\nIt should be intuitively obvious that it *cannot* be true to say most Americans can’t access $1,000… because the [median household net worth is over $120,000](https://smartasset.com/financial-advisor/average-net-worth-by-age) meaning half of households are richer than that.

You can see that there is no (adult) age group where the median liquid net worth is too low to cover a $1,000 emergency. And the **overall median liquid net worth is $12,500** as of 2016, so it’s immediately apparent that well over half of Americans can access $1,000 liquid if they need to.", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "Liquidity of assets requires a willing buyer. Assuming that because people have liquid investments/assets that they can have quick access to full value in cash isn’t a solid argument as liquidity of that quality relies on a strong market, which we’ve seen rapidly deteriorate over the last few months.\n\nFurthermore, with the increase in the cost of borrowing, liquidity not in the form of straight cash will inevitably become less liquid. Not saying you can’t sell stuff, merely that it’s getting more difficult to do so for full value. \n\nIn addition, accountants haven’t followed the mark to market approach since 2009ish because it’s partially to blame for 2008, and so we may not accurately reflect the true value of assets in the current market state. There is good and bad to that. We may presume that assets, or things like vehicles which have historically depreciated in value have a value much higher today than they’ll hold in the future. Used vehicle prices skyrocketed amid the chip shortage, and as sub prime auto loans default (which has already started) the mark for the price of used vehicles will lower and many people will be underwater on their purchase in the near future. \n\nTo add to that, the bubble in housing, which is a huge chunk of net worth, will deteriorate as the cost of borrowing goes up and the profitability of short term rentals (which is a highly oversaturated market) falls of a cliff. People travel less when budgets are tight. \n\n\nIn 2008 only 1-2% of homes foreclosed in the US, roughly 3-4 million. There are roughly 1 million STRs in the US.

That’s an order of magnitude greater than the hypothetical $1,000 emergency.
