Interest rates on this debt are rising and can't even make EVs at scale yet! Who can compete? Apple? Microsoft? Sony? Maybe. By the way even if they do, they'll be buying some of Tesla's batteries for the foreseeable future\n\nAs it stands the Chinese have their boots on the necks of legacy automotive companies with Semiconductor supply as well as Battery manufacturing and it doesn't make any sense for them to favour western countries over domestic producers like Xpeng and NIO\n\nI don't fully understand why Tesla is treated so favourably over there but I imagine it's got something to Tesla's open-source patents playing well with the CCP's issues with Intellectual property laws\n\n**The Big Picture**\n\n1.

Tesla could create humanoid robots to carry out the labor themselves. That would be pretty crazy!)\n\n# Here's the proof:\n\n[1a\\) Overall battery cost decline is expected to kick in around 2022.](https://preview.redd.it/y444ftr3auw81.jpg?width=854&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7513a1c07114dbe9781763bd1352b994034f1a1e)\n\n[1b\\) Overall margin increases](https://preview.redd.it/9mqqp5v5luw81.jpg?width=931&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=659a100094599fe77527150c7265a97e736b2318)\n\nBattery day was astonishing at the time, but I didn't really appreciate it until now. Tesla plans to more decrease battery costs (69%) by 2025 compared to other OEMs using their new 4680 production line. What does this mean for investors? The Model 3 has estimated 50kWh batteries. Minimum. Average cost of batteries s currently \\~$100/kWh. This means it costs Tesla roughly $5000 per battery. a 70% decrease in costs mean batteries will be just $1,500.\n\n$3,500 more profit per car, or $3,500 better pricing over OEMs. But since 2020 there have been intense inflationary pressures on the cost of materials.\n\n[2c\\) Tesla Battery Costs since 2020](https://preview.redd.it/iru06loxwuw81.jpg?width=690&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7147ae7350c57ea7e8e44a5b2c7af4feafcf4a1b)\n\n1. Overall material costs increased by 56% from 2020-2022. At the top, there are indexed prices of refined Nickel, Lithium and Cobalt prices.\n2. 2022 w/Mining indicates the overall battery costs when Tesla is mining and refining lithium will neutralise the inflation of other material costs and allow Tesla to have an obscene advantage over other Electric Vehicle manufacturers and Battery producers.\n\nTesla, in 2020, acquired rights to 10,000 acres of lithium mining land, quoted from battery day, **this is enough lithium to electrify the entire U.S. Car fleet**.\n\n[2a\\) Geologists are being hired at Tesla](https://preview.redd.it/x1uy5j6uhuw81.jpg?width=790&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a62efd697f02fb8950f8e78d4a3f78d5d0ba7db6)\n\n[2b\\) Lithium prices are now 13x what they were in 2020 during the battery day presentation. ](https://preview.redd.it/4y601qt6fuw81.jpg?width=591&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=02f9c540cf96b7a78e1a25b45ec53225fea4e878)\n\nOn the Q1 2022 earnings call Elon Musk quoted that Lithium extraction was achieving margins of 90%+.  Elon Musk has already hinted that Tesla is getting into the Mining & refining of Lithium. But to some, this has not been a secret for a while. Tesla is hiring Geologists. Why would a car company buy Lithium land and Geologists?\n\n**Effects of producing Lithium themselves:**\n\n1. Tesla operating margins increase. A 90% cost saving on Lithium will begin weighting itself over the overall business, causing a gradual operating margin increase over the years.\n2. Tesla can sell batteries to other OEMs at a cheaper price than **battery companies. If demand slows down or eventually Plateaus for Tesla Vehicles, they can sell their excess battery supply for margins which are actually better than the margins on their Vehicles**\n\nSo once Lithium is sorted, what will they do next? We already have evidence that Tesla want to **invest** and be **involved in the refinement process of Nickel - further cutting costs to production. Other materials are all but secured:**\n\nHere are some news articles on already secured nickel contracts. Tesla is **Partnering** with these companies, not just buying from them. These are all multi-year contracts. The Indonesian Nickel explicitly involves Tesla being involved in the entire process, not just raw material extraction. This is the same in\n\n1.

[https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-elon-musk-indonesia-nickel-deal-giga-texas-pictures/](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-elon-musk-indonesia-nickel-deal-giga-texas-pictures/)\n\n[3a. What are the lithium cost proportions per battery? \\(Source: Tesla\\)](https://preview.redd.it/utu02o8xeuw81.jpg?width=934&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5a6072b05093e15f721e6c43383fcf8f71121eab)\n\nHere's a TL;DR of how current inflation and battery demand increases will impact Tesla's business model versus other car manufacturers.\n\n1. Tesla is currently entering the Lithium mining industry. If they'll do Lithium, they'll do nickel. If they'll do Nickel they'll do cobalt (maybe). That's all three material inputs. But this is focused on **just** Lithium.\n2. Tesla will have $2000-3000 more profit per vehicle than current situation. I'm ignoring inflationary pressures as Tesla has raised the prices of its vehicles proportionate to this already, and we're already seeing raw material prices of nickel etc decrease since their peak earlier this year.\n3. Tesla will eventually be able to sell cells for cheaper than existing battery producers. Margins for these are over 50%, this is currently more than the margins on their vehicles.\n4. Even if demand for Tesla vehicles does eventually plateau, they have the potential to sell their excess battery supply - making money from other vehicles on U.S roads and potentially across the world if they can localise lithium production near other gigafactories globally.\n5. This won't happen because they can sell their cars for far cheaper than these companies, and will drop them if they are forced to. But they don't, because the cars and the chargers are the best.\n6. Young people want Teslas. Kids are Fascinated by Teslas. They aren't going to want Mercedes' and BMWs as much as they currently do when they get to their late 20s and are able to afford these cars. They want Cybertrucks and Teslas. The loyalty to Legacy automotive companies is declining and will continue to decline, rapidly and there's a tipping point where it's over for them. If demand drops below a certain threshold, they can't make their bond repayments and all have around  $100bn of debt each. They'll default and go bust. Tesla does not have this issue.\n\nThey cannot compete.\n\n**So, again:**\n\n1. Tesla has already secured the land for Lithium production.\n2. Tesla thus unlocks another opportunity to redefine the mining and extraction industry for efficiency and gains experience in the field.\n3. Tesla becomes exposed to mining and refining and gains knowledge of how to scale up mining and refining of raw materials. This could expand into other areas such as Nickel and Cobalt. Structural metals. Glass.\n4. Tesla will have the free cash flow required to acquire mining companies, refining companies and resource-rich Land.\n5. Tesla becomes almost fully vertically integrated. From materials in the ground to rolling cars off the production line. No intermediaries. No middlemen. **All Tesla.**\n\nThe only cost of production becomes Labor\n\n^(fuck me. imagine if like...
