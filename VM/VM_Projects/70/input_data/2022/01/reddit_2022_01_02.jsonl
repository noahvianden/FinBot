The issue is that Facebook pioneered such a profound social institution, and one that became massively controversial later on. VR is poised to be potentially equally profound as social media.  As a result many people are now thinking \"ohhh not you fuckers, not this time!\" This line of thinking can easily extend to lawmakers.\n\nPersonally I think they will overcome negative sentiment with amazing and well priced products and innovations, but the road there may be rocky. Additionally I think while Facebook may have done some nasty shit before, they will have less incentive to try anything truly evil with the metaverse.
