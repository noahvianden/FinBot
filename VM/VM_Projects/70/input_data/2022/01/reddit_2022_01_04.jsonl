The history books are filled with examples of companies that have gone under, either because they were committing fraud or because their business model sucked. The most recent big one I know of is JCPenneys. Some that come to mind are Enron, Worldcom, and half the internet companies of 2000. Some people get hurt financially, and some banks took a beating, but the market doesn't collapse. Even when Bill Hwang lost $20+ billion dollars last year, and the investment houses had to eat most of it, the market still didn't crash. In the big picture, these occurrences don't concern me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt would take an entire industry collapsing to cause a stock market crash. This happened in '08 (and we're lucky it was only a prolonged recession). It almost happened when the auto industry collapsed decades ago, but the US govt stepped in before it got too bad.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't see a housing collapse any time soon. There are SO MANY people that want a house but can't afford one. Every time prices dip, people will come out of the woodwork and try to buy. This is in addition to the plethora of investors that want rental properties. Remember a few months ago when Zillow had been buying houses at full price, then suddenly realized what a stupid fucking idea that was? They dumped 7,000 houses on the market all at once, and it didn't even make a dent in prices. In summary, I don't foresee a problem with the housing market.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also don't see any more long term stock market damage from COVID related news, unless the death toll rises dramatically. We have already survived the original COVID. We survived Delta. Omicron is a bitch, but it is less of a killer and even more of just a cold/flu. The news is overblown at this point. Honestly, if someone isn't vaccinated by now, they ain't gonna do it. We are where we are, and it's time to move forward. But the news media has to have something to whip people into a frenzy, so they won't let it go. Point being, the market isn't going to crash from any future COVID news, unless COVID merges with Ebola.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe can't predict the unknowable, like terrorist attacks or natural disasters. What I see at this point are two possible 'big picture' events that could wreak havoc in our markets.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. China taking military action. When someone turns to violence to get what they want, it is likely that they will turn to violence in the future when they want something else. If they decide to flex their muscles in Taiwan, Hong Kong, or anywhere else, that is a serious red flag to me. It hasn't happened yet, but I think that China is an issue that is too big to ignore.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNotes: China forcing their companies to leave foreign exchanges only affects their companies, and won't hurt the rest of our markets. And the Evergrande thing is already expected to be a total disaster, therefore it is priced into the market already. If they went bankrupt tomorrow it wouldn't matter one bit, as far as the markets are concerned.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. Inflation. I think this is our next biggest stock market challenge. Inflation has already been ravaging our country (and others as well). The way the government reports inflation is a seriously delayed reporting, which means that they are telling us about the inflation numbers that have already happened. The price increases we are experiencing now won't officially be reported until a year from now!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat is causing future inflation? Delays at the port cause shortages of goods, causing supply to decrease, leading to higher prices. Worker shortages cause companies to eventually pay more, leading to higher prices. For now, companies are seeing record profits as they are charging higher prices while simultaneously operating with skeleton crews. But that will have to change. You can only operate with a skeleton crew for so long.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you look at what happened in the 70's, inflation really hurt. I opened my first savings account in the 70's and it was paying 5.5% interest, which was really low at the time. The only chance we have of fighting inflation is the FOMC, and they have very limited power to affect the biggest economic machine in the world (the US economy). It is already known that the fed plans on increasing interest rates at least 3 times in 2022. Interest rate increases are generally downers for the stock market.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nInflation is the biggest \"obvious\" stink bomb that I see at this moment in time, and as a result I am limiting my time horizon for all of my investments to 3-6 months out. Things can change very quickly, and I will reevaluate every month or so. For now, I want to participate in the upside of stocks, but don't want to be caught with my pants down (again) if/when the market falls.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry so long.
