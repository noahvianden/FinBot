{"title": "Trying to have a level headed conversation about tech stocks", "selftext": "I would like to have a level headed conversation about having a tech heavy portfolio.\n\nIn this post, I try to lay out the risks associated with having a tech heavy portfolio, and how one can mentally prepare for the next 6-12 months as we go through some serious volatility in the market.\n\nI'm only going to focus on high flying tech and big cap tech for this. But you could extrapolate a lot of these messages to anything in the market today including fintech, green energy, biotech, etc.\n\nTLDR: P/S and P/E ratios of tech is at multiples that still expect growth. Bad forecast will drive down prices, potentially an additional 50% lower.\n\n*Disclaimer: The next few paragraphs are opinions and can be skipped if reader isn't interested.*\n\n***\n\nFirstly and foremost, let's remember than any internet forum that obscures users behind anonymity should inherently not be trusted. That goes for /r/stocks. The most important thing is to remain critical and skeptical of anything you read. Whether that is DD, advice, forecasts, etc. This also includes links to articles from reputable and non-reputable sources.\n\nWith that said, let us not ignore the fact that /r/stocks is not a safe haven or bastion for educated discourse on the stock market and tickers. It is merely another echo chamber full of ideologues waiting to say \"I told you so\". So anyone reading this sub should always take a break and clear their head before this forum causes mental health issues. But also be optimistic on the community, there occasionally exist users who are open minded, willing to have a discussion (rather than provide a lecture), and actually provide level headed advice. I do not claim to be one, for I have issues grappling with emotional trading, but I have found that there are diamonds in the rough within this subreddit.\n\nThe last thing I'll say about /r/stocks is that its a sentiment echo chamber. When things are going up, all the upvoted posts and comments are all about \"buy\" and \"gains\". When things are going down, all the upvoted posts are comments about \"sell\" or \"crash\". Again, look at everything critically.\n\n***\n\nReading this sub for the past 3 years, there's definitely been a shift towards most posts around tech tickers. Trying to wade through all the noise can be hard.\n\nTo begin, I'm a believer that everyone has a different personal risk profile. Anyone investing in the stock market or crypto or bonds or ANYTHING (ie. housing, art, antiques, collectibles, etc) should always sit down, use a spreadsheet and map out their budget, net worth, assets/liabilities and cash flows. Then they should make a projection on worst case scenarios. This should all happen before putting a penny into the stock market. This actually isn't hard to do, and it will help everyone realize their own personal risk ratios. Every portfolio should have a health mix of broad spectrum index funds (ie. VOO/VTI) in addition to individual stock. And always remember that sector ETFS (ie. SOX, ARKK, XLE, XLF, etc) are just the same as buying individual stocks, but just slightly lower risk.\n\nI personally tend to invest in tech because my career, personal interest and knowledge base is best aligned to tech. I tend not to invest in traditional energy, finance, consumer staples, social media, etc. because I don't feel like I have a good grasp on those industries.\n\nEveryone should understand that any money put into any asset is victim to the market. Whether its crypto, art or stocks. Fundamentals and technicals only go so far. When push comes to shove, there is only one thing that matters: how many buyers, how many sellers, how much inventory. Nothing else matters. So you can kick yourself to death for \"not buying more\" as much as you can yell about \"why is value collapsing\". Everything is a market, and are you ready to handle a scenario where the market moves against you?\n\nAlso, as we move forward, its REALLY important to have entry and exit prices in mind. And if you don't have those in mind, you will get caught with your pants down. You'll get stuck holding turd stocks forever, and will just be stuck in mental anguish. \n\n\n\n**High Flying Tech**\n\nFirst, lets talk about the most exciting tickers, the high growth tech stocks that have hurt the most in the past 12 months.\n\nFor this, I'd like to look at look at a few different stocks to do a simplified compare contrast. Each one of these stocks deserve a full post to themselves, but I'll opt to do something simpler for now.\n\nThe tickers that were hot in this field are tickets like NET, CRWD, FSLY, SNOW, ZS, DDOG, etc. These companies are tech first solutions, that enable various IT services whether that is hosting, storage, data mining, monitoring, security, etc. All these stocks took a 40%+ beating back in January 2020 during the first big sell off, back when the 10Y treasury yields first popped above 1.5%. This created a lot of worry in the market and all growth was hit, including these companies.\n\nThe bottom for these hit around May, before a historic rally back up in October with exuberance that mimicked January 2021. Since November 2021 to now, most of these stocks are down 50%+. The skeptical thing to look here is valuations. Most of these companies have nose bleed valuations, even after a 50% correction.\n\nAnd though these many be good companies, they are still valued at price point levels that are pulling forward 5-10 years of growth. NET for example is still operating at a valuation of 50x P/S. NET is predicting to make $660M in revenue for CY2021, and has a market cap of 30Bn. They are aiming to grow at a rate of 40%, they operate at 80% gross margins, but are yet to be profitable due to reinvestment into R&D and marketing. NET, my all measures, is a very successful company. Great growth, strong customer retention, expanding product lines, great reviews, tech leadership through their blog, strong brand identity, etc. But their valuation is hard to digest and defend.  I feel companies like CRWD, SNOW, ZS and DDOG all into this category. They are all operating at bonkers P/S values, the bet is on huge revenue growth YoY, and if any of them slip that their price will crater. FSLY is a great example of what could happen here. Their revenue growth slowed and they lost a single heavy customer making up most of their revenue, causing their stock to tank 70%  and struggle to recover.\n\nWhat is the risk in today's environment? If you believe we're in a tech bubble propped up by cheap free money (ie 0% interest rates and QE policies), then look at AKAM from 2000 as an example. In October 1999, AKAM IPO'd at ~$110. Then over the next 5 months it rocketed to a price of $300. Then dotcom crash occurred, and AKAM was caught up in it. This was a good company making good money with a strong product. And it cratered from a price of $300 in March 2000 to being worth $1.00 in September 2002. So if you're holding SNOW at $280, that is projecting 100% revenue growth in CY2022, and hence has a P/S of 80 with margins of 60%, what happens when that growth slows to 80%? or 50%? What happens when interest rates go up to 1% and DCF pushes profitability break even out 5years? or 10 years?\n\nIf you don't buy into the bubble hysteria, then everyone in this high flying tech stocks should have a plan. Whether that is to watch them bleed for months and years, and then buy in at reasonable valuations to drive down cost average. Or if its to sell CC's to reinvest the prices. Or whether that is to sell and get out and wait to get back in. And the only recommendation I have here is to write down your strategy. These stocks will be the most volatile.\n\nThe warning here is not to get caught up in \"This is a great company that makes money\". When market forces move against you in the macro, quality and performance don't matter. SNOW operating a \"reasonable\" valuation of a forward P/S of 10 (like MSFT, or AAPL) would be priced at around $50-ish. NET would be priced at $40-ish. etc etc. This is even factoring in the growth rates they're projecting.\n\nDon't forget that these stocks are valued at what they are right now because of P/S multiples for the sector. If investor sentiment moves away from this, we could see a real decline. Again, make a plan.\n\n**Big Tech**\n\nThere are feelings that all of SPY is being propped up by a handful of big tech (ie. AAPL, MSFT, FB, AMZN, TSLA, NVDA, etc) and their lofty valuations. I think there's a spread on this, but as you can see, even big tech isn't insulated from bad forecasts. NFLX has lost 45% of its value, 20% in the last two days, due to a bad forecast. What happens if Apple announces that inflation and unemployment has lead to lowered iPhone demand? Or if Tesla says that there aren't enough people buying their $50k electric cars? Or if Amazon says that people aren't buying as much stuff online because their budgets are tightening?\n\nIts important to separate behemoths from high growth big tech. For example, AAPL, MSFT and AMZN are not in the same bucket as TSLA and NVDA. MSFT has $176Bn in sales with margins of 70% on a market cap of $2.2T. TSLA on the other hand TSLA has sales of $46Bn with margins of 23% on a market cap of $947Bn.\n\nI do not believe that TSLA and NVDA are immune from collapsing 50% further from where they are now. They're operating at huge P/S and P/E values compared to their loftier counter parts. But its important to note that NVDA and TSLA are essentially leaders (and maybe even monopolies...) in niche emerging tech areas. It may be bold, but you could claim that NVDA is to AI as MSFT was to operating systems in 2000. Or TSLA is to EV's as AAPL was to smart phones in 2008.\n\nThese companies are not going bankrupt, and have shown a strong history of revenue growth. But downward pressure across macro factors could lead to lowered forecasts. Imagine that supply chain for chips doesn't improve and NVDA cannot manufacture as much GPUs? Or that inflation eats away at savings of individuals and they can't afford $50k electric cars? These things could really these companies as forecasts will drive down the P/S and P/E multiples that investors are willing to pay.\n\n**Conclusion**\n \nAgain, I reiterate not to make emotional decisions. Selling just because things are going down, or buying because things \"seem cheap\" isn't smart. Make a plan based on critical thinking and personal risk profiles. If you're making emotional decisions, it means you've taken on too much risk. You need to seriously make a plan to derisk. Whether that is selling at a loss to buy SPY/VOO/VTI, or whether that is to stop looking at your account and set up a DCA strategy around VOO to derisk your entire net worth profile.\n\nAnd the number one most important thing: The stock market is a casino. Literally nothing is a sure thing. Even strong well established companies aren't guaranteed. Buying GE in October 1999 would have set you back $400/share. Even if you averaged down over the next 20 years, you may still be under water with GE.\n\nLook at the draw down of AMZN, MSFT, GE, in March 2000, and compare that to the drawdown and return of SPY. Buying MSFT at its peak in 1999 would have taken 15 years to break even without DCA. AMZN took 7 years. GE never broke even. CSCO took 20 years. \n\nIndex funds win in the long term, but the returns are steady and over 10+ year time horizons. This is where looking on /r/stocks or /r/wsb can mess with your mental health. Someone may have invested in NET in October 2021, and rode that thing to 150% gains by November. But if they didn't sell, they could be sitting on losses for the next 5 years. And those losses could destroy 10 years worth of general market growth. Understanding risk is very important.\n\nWhen comparing index funds, remember that not all index funds are equal. QQQ didn't break even from the dotcom crash until 15 years later. SPY recovered in 7 years before housing crushed it a second time (which took 5 more years to recover).\n\nAgain, I'm not saying we're in dotcom. There are arguments for and against.\n\nFor bubble: unprecedented years of zero inflation rate and QE; irrational market exuberance on unsustainable P/S and P/E multiples; irrational retail investors; revenues pulled forward multiple years through a detached economy\n\nAgainst bubble: P/E ratio on average across SPY not unrealistic; higher productivity of most companies; no fundamental black swan events\n\nWhat I am saying is have a plan, and be realistic about what a \"reasonable price\" is, and what your expected results are.

I’ll try to explain...\n\nThe S&P currently sits around 38 p/e almost twice the average historically.

And it sits around p/e of 23! \n\nSo just take these valuations and factor in growth rates into the next 5 years and its clear FB will outperform the market. Even if you cut their growth rate into half or even a third- still the math works out to crush the s&p. Cut FB valuation in half today - so another 50% drop down to about 150.00 per share...still will crush the s&p over the next 5 years. \n\nThe only reasons it may not outperform are...\n\nMaybe valuations on big tech go to crazy low while the s&p stays high...not likely, never happened, and so irrational that it would just mean buy buy buy tech!

And they accept a few basis points in interest rather than face penalties for not having enough bonds to back up the deposits.  There is a shortage of pristine collateral ie treasuries especially t bills.  The issue is consumers have spent the stimmies, spent their savings, had wealth transferred to billionaires and corporations, maxing out their credit cards and everything is expensive.  So it’s not systemic lack of liquidity but a tapped out, ripped off consumer.  And destruction of small and medium sized businesses.
