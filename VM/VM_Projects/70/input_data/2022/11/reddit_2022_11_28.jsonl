{"title": "BABA: The ‚ÄúUninvestable‚Äù Sleeping Giant", "selftext": "You are making a mistake ignoring BABA: \n\n75% of the marketcap is covered by cash + investments.  Alibaba cloud will be huge.  This is a great buy in price.  It‚Äôs funny how when it was $200+ everyone was on board but when it is $63 everyone jumps ship.  Herd mentality‚Ä¶. Which is why people stay poor.\n\nYes, an investment in BABA is an investment in the Chinese economy \n\n*CHINAS FUTURE IS BRIGHT* \n\nThere's no question that the material conditions in china have improved considerably in the last 30 years, 10 of which were under the direction of Xi.  He's their guy.  They like him.  86-91% approval rating.  Again, you don't have to like it, but that's a fact and it's really not hard to understand why.\n\nReal wages of Chinese people, that is adjusted for inflation, are up well over *a thousand percent* since 1990.  There's new cities, new trains, new foods in the markets, very fast and cheap internet, reliable electricity, and many many other material improvements in just the last 32 years.  If you were a Chinese person born in Chengdu in 1990, your life is unrecognizable now to what it was.  \n\nLet‚Äôs look at numbers: *50.2 million Chinese kids are in university* compared to the US's 1.5 million (of the 2.5 million enrollees in America, 47% are foreign).  They have 40,000km of high speed rail, the US has zero. The US has a 60% homeownership rate compared to *China's 91%*.  China has *high 90s% literacy*, while the US has slipped to 78%. \n\nDon‚Äôt bet against the Chinese economy! \n\nI have over 1k shares of BABA this is an amazing stock to hold", "id": "z6t8tq", "created_utc": 1669631781.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.37, "num_comments": 77, "comments": [{"body": "your post history about baba is making my brain hurt", "score": 30, "replies": [{"body": "just saw it myself.
