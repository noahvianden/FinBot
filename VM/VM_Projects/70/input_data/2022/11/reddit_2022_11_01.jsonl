Best case, essentially already bottomed. Unless for some reason you have reason to think that this time is worse than every other time in history", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Bah hahahahaha.  Donâ€™t tempt Reddit.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "I welcome their explanation for how this could be worse than getting off the gold standard and dealing with 15% inflation", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "1)Wellâ€¦. It is worse then thatâ€¦. In the last 40 years since then the cost of living has been going up at a steady pace yet the minimum wage has not kept upâ€¦. Even jobs that pay double the minimum wage can barely keep a family of 4 afloat with only one income earner. So there is a greater disparity between what minimum wage was then to cost of living vs. What the minimum wage is now vs. The cost of living.\n\n2)Secondly, while inflation was extremely high back then so was interest earned on savings. Back then(1980)you could get 15%-20% return on your money in a savings gas account. Mind you a lot of people had to walk away from their housesâ€¦ Since the 2008 crash letâ€™s just say that a 5% gain in a year on your retirement would be a great returnâ€¦ barely above the cost of livingâ€¦ everyone for the last 12-14th years has made practically nothing when you factor in inflation on their retirement savingsâ€¦. Thatâ€™s affecting a lot of retired people today to the point where they have to work after retirementâ€¦ just to make ends meet. and will affect a lot more in the coming years.\n\n 3)Rising interest rates are not such a big deal even if it went up to 6% or 7%â€¦ itâ€™s actually great for retirement savings because now people will be able to make a return on their investment over the yearsâ€¦ The problem lies in how high house prices have become since the 2008 crash and the extremely low interest rates for over a decade. Now buying that $1million house will cost $50k-60k interest a year as opposed to $25k/year when mortgage rates were 2.5%. How are people going to sell their houses for a profit when the interest rate on mortgages pretty much tripled in a yearâ€¦ and still need to go up to at least 5.5%-6%. Wages are not going up. Not everyone is making great money. Expenses are rising at a crazy pace. People are brokeâ€¦ consumer debt is at all time highsâ€¦. Utilitiesâ€¦. Fuelâ€¦used vehiclesâ€¦. This will force more people to keep renting, which will make rental prices go up even higher to their being less of a supply, which in turn makes saving for a down payment that much more difficultâ€¦.\n\n4)Daycareâ€¦. Namely for a family of four with 2 young children at home. $1000/month per kid if not more spent on daycareâ€¦. \n\nLetâ€™s just say that at one time one person could work, one person could stay home and raise the kids.\n\nThen it changed - 1 person needed to work and one person could work part time\n\nThen it became 2 people needed to work and the grandparents or someone else needed to watch the kids after school if you were luckyâ€¦\n\nNow we are at the point where the grandparents, adult children and the children need to live together because everything has gotten so damn expensiveâ€¦. and itâ€™s only getting worseâ€¦. Maybe some friends, aunts, unclesâ€¦. It just seems like 2 adults can barely scrape by if at all anymore.\n\nBottom line is something is broken in the current system and at some point soon the whole market should take a rather massive hitâ€¦. Something has to give.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Well.... Can't disagree with much of that. Besides that things will continue on until they get REALLY bad. I don't think we are there yet.

Considering the minimum wage barely doubled in 20yearsâ€¦. That would put the minimum wage at $50-$60/hrs with a great paying job paying in the neighbourhood of $300/hrs or $48,000/month while the average job might be $120/hrâ€¦. Or just less then $18,000/monthâ€¦. For whatever a mortgage payment would be on a $6million home plus all associated expenses.\n\nI donâ€™t think I could afford a mortgage payment plus property taxes on that kind of salary if the house prices showed the kind of return my neighbour sawâ€¦.\n\nOr the cost of actually retiring one day considering the low interest rates for the last decade and lower growth rate of my investmentsâ€¦\n\nSomeone who is older can draw on their experience to make these callsâ€¦ but from my point of view my conservative investment money is worth considerably less todayâ€¦. Plus with rising costs itâ€™s getting hard to even save let alone invest for retirement.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I see what youâ€™re saying. And yes, I would agree with your point. The older generation definitely had a much greater buying power than we do and as a generationâ€¦ Iâ€™m assuming youâ€™re younger than 65. \n\nItâ€™ll be interesting to see about future home prices and inflation over the next 30 years. Population decline, decreasing buying power, stagnate wages, inflationâ€¦ thereâ€™s a lot there to unpack and speculate on. \n\nI donâ€™t foresee a great correction or collapsing of the financial markets though.
