{"title": "Goldman Sachs sees ‘high probability’ of OPEC cut — and expects oil prices to hit $110 next year", "selftext": "https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/29/oil-goldman-sachs-sees-high-probability-of-opec-production-cut-.html\n\nA group of some of the world’s most powerful oil producers is highly likely to take further measures to stem a price decline and try to balance the market, according to Goldman Sachs. OPEC and non-OPEC producers, an influential energy alliance known as OPEC+, will convene in Vienna, Austria on Dec. 4 to decide on the next phase of production policy. It comes amid recession fears, weakening crude demand in China from renewed Covid-19 lockdowns and as market participants assess the looming impact of a Western price cap on Russian oil. Jeff Currie, global head of commodities at Goldman Sachs, said Tuesday that a combination of factors had led the bank to downgrade its oil price forecasts in recent months.\n\n“First and foremost, it was the dollar. What is the definition of inflation? Too much money chasing … too few goods,” Currie told CNBC’s Steve Sedgwick at Goldman Sachs’ Carbonomics conference in London. The second factor “has to do with Covid and China — and by the way, it’s big,” he continued. “It’s worth more than the OPEC cut for the month of November, let’s put it in perspective. And then the third factor is Russia is just pushing barrels on the market right now before that December 5th deadline for the export ban.” Currie said the medium-term oil outlook for 2023 was “very positive” and the bank plans to “stick to our guns” with a $110-a-barrel Brent crude forecast for next year.\n\nHe acknowledged, however, that there’s “a lot of uncertainty” ahead. Oil prices have fallen in recent months. International benchmark Brent crude futures, which stood at $100 a barrel in late August, traded at $85.46 a barrel on Tuesday afternoon in London, up 2.7% for the session.  “Demand is probably heading south again in China given what’s going on,” Currie said. “I think the key point with China right now is the risk that you get a forced reopening. That means it’ll be self-imposed lockdowns where people don’t want to get on trains, don’t want to get to work and demand goes further south.” Currie said OPEC producers will need to discuss whether to accommodate further weakness in demand in China. “I think there is a high probability that we do see a cut,” he added.", "id": "z7v4qy", "created_utc": 1669731017.0, "score": 458, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 75, "comments": [{"body": "What happened to the shale oil narrative?

You need millions or even billions of dollars in upfront capital to start production.  On top of that, you need a way to get the crude to the refineries (truck, rail, pipeline) and capacity to refine it.  \n\n\nThe oil and gas companies are currently NOT investing in new projects because of the regulatory environment.  They're not going to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on a project to not get the green light to operate.  This administration hasn't approved a single new well, so the big oil and gas companies are sitting on their cash and waiting.  \n\nThe existing wells are still operating, and as the price goes higher, theyre making more money per barrel.

The slope of this graph can only go up so fast:\n\nhttps://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/crude-oil-production\n\nYou could scale fracking internationally easily enough, but it hasn’t happened because of Greta and cheap gas from Russia.  And so cheap gas sits in the earth just waiting for extraction.  That is why all the talk of mega OPEC cuts and >100 barrel oil are just more FUD.\n\nEvery cut OPEC does just allows the US and EU to frack more.  It’s a game of chicken - a price war in the making.  They know this.  It all came to a head once before in 2010s.  They’re not going to want to go there, so their rhetoric will be strong but their cuts will be tepid.  OPEC needs their oil money more than the US does, so they will always have to be a low cost producer.  And therefore the economics dictate that they will always have to be the last to cut.  \n\nBecause if they slowly cut to match the increases from western suppliers to keep crude artificially high (say $100 barrel) and the west has essentially limitless supply in the $35 dollar range, what will happen over time is opec will cut itself into negligible production.  These countries can’t afford this, and they can’t afford to admit that this is a problem.\n\nTheir ONLY lever in this situation is to aggressively increase production and challenge western fracking suppliers by flooding the market with cheap crude and see who goes tits up.  This was their playbook in the 2010s.  This is the playbook they’ll have to follow here.  They can’t cut into price stability in the face of massive western production coming online or they will choke themselves to death.\n\nIn summary, the shale oil narrative is limited by two things, how fast western countries can get it online, and opec’s desire to flood the market to choke new production that comes online.", "score": 39, "replies": [{"body": "Limitless supply at $35 in the west???

Western countries aren't investing in new production because banks aren't financing, at least to allow for 35$ fracking.\n\nI think OPEC sees China demand declining precipitously and US's ability to bring new supplies online as limited rn, so will keep cutting production to keep prices artificially high.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "ESG and green policies are dumb, but way overblown in the oil market compared to unit economics.  People these days on reddit, in the press and etc are just looking to drive engagement, so they come up with vapid political narratives to drive influencer points.  Important to look beyond this.\n\nThe reason western countries haven’t invested in exploration in the last 10 years is because they got smacked by opec and caught in an over leveraged position In the last decade.  There was a gold rush for fracking, and it created a lot of losses all across the supply chain.  So this time they are being a bit conservative.  \n\nBut they are still expanding production, and have been for some time as the numbers show.  We will cross an all time high of production in the US next year.  Lost in the noise is that US has also committed to use the SPR as a price buffer against cheap international crude to encourage long term oil investment.  Meanwhile demand is going flat or shrinking.  This will absolutely create a crash in oil prices at some time, probably next year. And probably brought on by settlement of war in Ukraine.\n\nSo I would stay the heck away from the oil market.  There is a LOT of speculation going on right now on wars and inflation, and there is way too much oil in the world right now - the only upside argument is that the political situation gets worse.
