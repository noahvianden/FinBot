{"title": "HP’s stock rockets after Berkshire Hathaway reveals 11% stake", "selftext": "Shares of HP Inc. surged in after-hours trading Wednesday after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. disclosed that it had taken a large stake in the Silicon Valley maker of personal computers and printers. \n\nBerkshire BRK.A, +0.19% BRK.B, -0.03% disclosed in a late Wednesday filing that it owned 120.95 million shares of HP HPQ, -3.03% after buying shares in recent days. That position is worth about $4.2 billion and represents a roughly 11% stake in the company. The stock rose nearly 10% in after-hours trading.\n\n“HP is committed to one of the largest share-repurchase programs (relative to market cap) within our coverage, so we think Berkshire’s involvement makes sense,” Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani wrote in a note to clients.\n\nWhile he said he didn’t believe that Berkshire’s investment in HP would drive significant changes to HP’s business, he deemed the high-profile stake a “validation of HPQ’s strategy/capital return program,” noting that Berkshire began purchasing shares after HP announced plans to purchase the workplace-technologies company Poly for $3.3 billion late last month.\n\nBerkshire’s HP stake indicates that Buffett sees value in HP’s business, though several analysts have sounded cautious lately on the market for personal computers following a pandemic-driven boom.\n\n“Specifically, we believe PC and consumer hardware spending will be pressured as supply improves and demand normalizes after two years of above-trend growth,” Morgan Stanley’s Erik Woodring wrote in explaining his March 31 downgrades of HP and Dell Inc. DELL, -3.16% shares.", "id": "ty81uf", "created_utc": 1649318349.0, "score": 93, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 77, "comments": [{"body": "\"rockets\" aka goes back to what it was last week.", "score": 74, "replies": [{"body": "Need to start handing out punishments for these click bait pieces of crap.
