I KNEW from the beginning he was racist and instead of calling him out upfront (because calling out racism is a seemingly bad thing on Reddit in the opinion of most white people I’ve come across on here) I let the conversation keep going until he outright started berating Black people. Which again, was this idiots OBVIOUS intention. Obvious to anyone of Afro American descent at least. We’ve been dealing with racism for centuries in this country. Just like a 6th generation tomato farming family would specialize in recognizing weather and soil and whatever revolves around tomatoes. Nobody should be questioning when we spot racism. I’m glad I got this idiot banned. People actually gave his post a good amount of likes which is very telling. Racists are only comfortable speaking up in places that have made them feel comfortable.
