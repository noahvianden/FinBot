It is always possible that the deal collapses at the last minute, the sources added.\n\nMusk, the world's richest person according to a tally by Forbes, is negotiating to buy Twitter in a personal capacity and Tesla is not involved in the deal.\n\nTwitter has not been able to secure so far a 'go-shop' provision under its agreement with Musk that would allow it to solicit other bids once the deal is signed, the sources said. Still, Twitter would be allowed to accept an offer from another party by paying Musk a break-up fee, the sources added.\n\nThe sources requested anonymity because the matter is confidential. Twitter and Musk did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nTwitter shares were up 4.5% in pre-market trading in New York on Monday at $51.15.\n\nMusk has said Twitter needs to be taken private to grow and become a genuine platform for free speech.\n\nThe deal would come just four days after Musk unveiled a financing package to back the acquisition. This led Twitter's board to take the deal more seriously and many shareholders to ask the company not to let the opportunity for a deal to slip away, Reuters reported on Sunday. read more\n\nThe sale would represent an admission by Twitter that its new chief executive Parag Agrawal, who took the helm in November, is not making enough traction in making the company more profitable, despite being on track to meet ambitious financial goals the company set for 2023. Twitter's shares were trading higher than Musk's offer price as recently as November.\n\nMusk's negotiating tactics - making one offer and sticking with it - resembles how another billionaire, Warren Buffett, negotiates acquisitions.

I think we have maybe two years of real chop and the real possibility of a crash, but it's important to understand that this not being a liquidity crisis actually kind of matters in the mid to long term.\n\nAlso the point that equities and bonds are shrinking at the same time is problematic in this case because the Fed has manipulated the bond market, affecting its volume since December and that has had an impact on bond valuations and buy-in interest. If you're in the traditional 60/40 portfolio, you're losing money on both sides of the trade. Since 2008, bond relationships to capital liquidity and market action have basically violated the standard assumptions in large part because those assumptions are based on the idea of natural market signals, and this is not a natural bond market.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Just stumbled across this comment and it hits home. So many people calling it that liquidity is drying up, but some see it as liquidity getting expensive. And both tend to have totally different impacts on the economy.\n\nDo you have any thoughts on how liquidity getting expensive would affect the economy and the markets? (assuming the Fed doesn't make a policy mistake).", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Well, expensive capital means less growth and less demand... so it'll be restraining relative to the 0% days.\n\nThe question is where the equilibrium is.\n\nLet's start by identifying what the Fed not making a policy mistake looks like:\n\nLet's say they walk the tightrope, don't commit a policy error, and get everything exactly right and we find equilibrium between cost and ideal supply and demand dynamics across all spaces. Unemployment in this case will settle back into a 4-5% space, the number of ghost reqs will normalize, and you'll see earnings level off to the extent that they make sense relative to the balance, at which point growth will return because we will have overcorrected in both the market and the larger economy.\n\nBasically, the economy will look more like the pre-2020 space in a more normalized type of circumstance with maybe some relatively elevated inflation for a period of time but much lower than it is right now.\n\nCost of capital is only a true restrainer if growth isn't beating it... so the outcome really depends on how far rates and costs run.\n\nAt this point, almost 6 months after the comment I wrote above, I think the chance of a policy mistake is scarily high.\n\nIt's evident to me that the Fed is making knee-jerk reactions to appear to be acting on the basis of lagging indicators, and that's bad. Now I don't think the current rate is so bad that it will inherently kill the economy, so there's still space to play before we end up in a Fed-manufactured liquidity crisis, and the banks still have stress room to play at least according to the last stress test... so we're OK for now...\n\n...but the problem right now is that the Fed is off the rails, does not have a plan, and is reacting too quickly. We're probably only seeing the economic impact of the first rate hikes right now, so the Fed is a good 3%+ ahead of the macro indicators. Unemployment's going to lag into that, meaning that by the time the employment market shows the damage, it'll already be too late... and to be frank, I don't know who they're hiring for their projections but there's a lot of old world thinking baked into these numbers and that's bad and why they've been behind the curve.\n\nTo be fair, projecting the future is impossible on a good day, so I'm not going to beat them up too much, but the point is... can anyone trust the Fed?\n\nAnd the answer right now is that we can't, so the market and corporations are positioning themselves right now as if we will have a liquidity crisis which is part of what the Fed is trying to accomplish to slow things down.\n\nSo the real question right now is... when will the Fed stop? And will we get lucky with the demand dynamics such that existing demand sustains without completely dropping out and creating a downward spiral and as a result a liquidity crisis... because anything beyond that equilibrium carries the risk of crisis, and risk of crisis from the market perspective might as well be crisis with fear at this level.\n\nBUT, going back to what I was saying 6 months ago, the Fed even in that circumstance won't take all the punch out of the bowl and banks SHOULD stay solvent, so the consumer should remain relatively strong (especially compared to other global economies) even with expensive cost of capital, so from the market perspective I think we're looking at overreaction and return to upward trend once certainty realizes and the Fed starts to slow down.\n\nAt that point the question is whether growth potential beats the cost of capital and COGS on fund balance sheets, because if it does then funds will still leverage margin and buy into the market to deploy capital because in a situation of certainty, it would be problematic from a business perspective not to build up long positions since anyone sitting out on a run with capital availability will underperform once that happens.\n\nThe big question is... is that point the end of this year? Mid next year? 2024? I don't know... it will eventually happen, though, just because a complete long term breakdown isn't systemically palatable or sustainable.\n\nThe Fed right now is myopically focused on inflation and leaving the employment and economic growth mandate on the sidelines, eventually if we do have a liquidity crunch that will reverse... just like happened with the Bank of England. Hopefully we don't get to the point they did before that happens.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "FED kicked the can from end 2019 till now.

{"title": "Should I short Tesla?", "selftext": "Okay so this might even be my first OP post on reddit. Let me begin by saying I haven't invested any money till now in US stock market but I am thinking of shorting TSLA just based on the valuations.\n\nI know it is more of a meme stock, but how much small investor vs institutional investor money is really in this stock and is the world really that mad about Elon?\n\nI have seen countless articles where he has proved himself to be a d!ck. The latest one being okay to pay the penalty for not announcing his position on Twitter, or might I remind you the caves fiasco where he called a saviour, rapist?\n\nAnywho I think TSLA has created a shift towards electrical mobility but I still don‚Äôt think they are that ahead of the competition. From Koreans to Germans or even big ol' Americans everyone is moving towards electric mobility and I think even phase 4 autonomous systems have been created by the likes of Volvo. Even for TSLA where market P/E is ~7 they are trading at ~130 and have equally if not more problems for scaling and democratizing this tech.\n\nIs the Insta generation be all and end all of our era or can this stock really go down?\n\nNeed honest opinions.\n\nEdit: I felt the need to clarify where I was coming from.\nI absolutely agree that Tesla is a big company and deserves to be big but at the same time I feel people are not looking at the competition.\n\nJust giving an example look at Hyundai. Ioniq 5 is a very good electric car. Plus it will be sold all over the world including growing economies. In a time of 5-10 years these economies will buy much more cars because of low penetration per 100 and those numbers will add up. Now this is a global corporation with massive economies of scale and they have already forgone IC development altogether. This is just one example and others are trying equally hard. I feel Tesla is not at all positioned at this change and will not be able to democratize the technology globally.\n\nWith current valuations, it has to be 5x better than any global corp the world has ever seen with enough capital and supplier/vendor situation pretty established. I just don't believe they are 5x better than Daimler.", "id": "ubte0s", "created_utc": 1650915304.0, "score": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.57, "num_comments": 85, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|2|**First Seen In WSB**|1 hour ago\n**Total Comments**|1|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=ubte0s)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=ubte0s)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Yes, please do it.
