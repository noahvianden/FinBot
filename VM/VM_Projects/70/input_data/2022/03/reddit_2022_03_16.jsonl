Meaning not only do you need to monitor the drive itself, but also monitor the cars behavior. Basically you are like a driving instructor. You know those cars where they have a 2nd brake so they can take control? Thats exactly what this is like. Good luck with inner streets. I dont think you can even turn it on there can you?

The only thing that seems worth it is the parking and even that is like pulling teeth. It only parks in reverse and wow is it slow. If you do that at costco on a busy day a lot of people will be very angry assuming they dont take your parking as the idiot car pull forward to backup.
