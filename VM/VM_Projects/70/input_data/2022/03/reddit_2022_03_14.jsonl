Meaning its a generational type stock that will likely still be around in 100 years and still doing well due to content and entertainment venues.\n\nBut its also risky in terms of short term performance due to international exposure, high capital costs (inflation hurts a lot), social trends (not so popular in the 2000s and other points in time), and other cyclical factors.\n\nI do own DIS shares as part of my anchor portfolio (very long term holdings) but if your time frame is 1-5 years, then it may not be great. I would say that they are currently in pretty lousy shape. \n\nMY SHORT TERM (1-5 YEAR) OUTLOOK  \n\\--------------------------------------------------------\n\nLast years new IP's were not great and will not generate a lot of new rev in toys or streaming. Baby Yoda is probably already slowing down.\n\nTheir streaming service is still, to this day, mostly made up of free or highly discounted subs and I seriously doubt they will be able to monetize as much as people think. They have one of the worst rev/sub of any major streaming service. So either sub growth will come to a crawl as they raise prices (maybe even shrink) or their rev/sub will remain low forever. Got to be honest, their streaming service sucks. Not enough content especially for adults. My 3 kids dont use it (ages 3-7). If it werent free we wouldnt have it. So thats the bear case for their streaming.\n\nDIS is slowly disenfranchising its park base due to extreme increases in prices. My wife and her group of fanatics are actually angry. She has already stated she wont be going back after her current annual pass is expired. My wife actually knows Chapek by name which was a surprise to me (lol). Most of the complaints are about high prices (even before COVID), the high number of block out dates, having to reserve a date to enter (not so easy when you have kids), and they hate the new quick pass system (dunno what they call it now).\n\nAgain, Disney is dependent on social sentiment. It wasnt always so popular. Back in the 90s the annual pass was something like $150/yr or so and the place was still a ghost town on weekdays. Like literally walk into any ride with maybe a 5 minute line. Weekends got more busy but still not full except holidays. It just wasnt popular. I was a teen at the time and saw Disney as childish and boring. I actually hated going there and I still do as an adult but for other reasons (not a fan of crowds, lines, or their theme park food). Newer generation of teens seem to like it but the point here is there is no guarantee that this trend continues.\n\nLast, and this is a very minor thing, but have you seen the new Mickey and friends cartoons? They are absolutely horrifying. They look like Ren and Stimpy... basically like straight up meth heads. The character design is downright scary especially Goofy.

{"title": "How does the stock market perform in a Recession?", "selftext": "The talk of recession has been in the air for a while, and it’s looming over the economy like a boogeyman. In spite of all the talk, clarity is lacking on what a recession means for the economy. How can it affect the stock market and your portfolio? Let’s take a quick look at how a recession happens and what’s happened to the market in past recessions to answer this.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a8gczk7xgcn81.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=abe9cd0d57be4fa34ec9d1dbb13f9559c9c92b10\n\n### What is a recession?\n\nThe National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) has defined a recession as “a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy, lasting more than a few months, normally visible in real GDP, real income, employment, industrial production, and wholesale-retail sales.”[1](https://marketsentiment.substack.com/p/recession-primer?s=w#footnote-1)\n\nA recession, unlike a temporary decline or disruption in economic activity, is more long-lasting and has implications for the entire economy. Some of the probable causes of a recession are:\n\n1. **Sudden economic shock** \\- Like the OPEC oil supply cut-off in 1970 or the COVID crisis in 2020, an unexpected rupture in the economic cycle can trigger a recession.\n2. **Excessive debt** \\- The housing bubble in 2007 is a prime example of this. The availability of cheap credit turned into a nationwide disaster when speculation on housing prices led to thousands of people defaulting on debt - and shaking the economy which was built on this debt.\n3. **Asset bubbles** \\- The Dot-Com bubble in 2000 was a time when the mere status of being in the “Internet” business would make investors line up to invest. This led to a massive bubble that popped and created a recession.\n4. **Inflation** \\- When inflation is rampant, the Fed steps in and increases rates (like it did in 1970), prioritizing the stabilization of unemployment and other metrics over economic growth. This leads to a recession.\n5. **Deflation or Technological change** \\- A lack of demand for goods and services being produced, or increasing unemployment due to automation of jobs could lead to demand-side issues and lead to a recession. The deflation scenario was seen in Japan.\n\nSo which of these can we tick off now? The economy is still recovering from the disruption of the pandemic but the war has brought in a whole new set of shocks. Inflation is the highest it’s been in more than 40 years, and with the Crypt\\* market gaining traction, asset bubbles are now easier than ever to manufacture. Three out of five causes - sounds like a reason for worry. If a recession does occur, what are the implications?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pq11arbygcn81.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=edaabce2f255ecfad07376b17fb3a387623d379f\n\n### How long do recessions last?\n\nThough recessions have a scary reputation, since 1945, recessions have lasted an average of 11 months with a 2.3% average decline in GDP. **No recession has lasted more than 18 months in the past 70 years.** The reason that a recession might seem scary now is also because of the *recency bias* where we tend to remember things that happened in the recent past more vividly - The longest recession after WW2 was the 2007 financial crisis, and that has overpowered the other data.\n\nLet’s take a look at all the recessions after WW2. Ben Carlson from “A Wealth of Commonsense” has written [a couple of](https://awealthofcommonsense.com/2015/03/stock-performance-before-during-after-recessions/) [articles](https://awealthofcommonsense.com/2019/10/everything-you-need-to-know-about-recessions/) that dive much deeper into these questions, and I’m leveraging that data for this analysis.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b86i8tlzgcn81.png?width=892&format=png&auto=webp&s=672c49f4a822f788ea1f7eb8de996620903a5b2b\n\nAs can be seen, in the past 13 years, recessions caused the market to lose value only half of the time, and on average you would still have come out ahead, with an **overall return of 1.7%.** This means that recession or not, investing in the stock market was still one of the best bets available.\n\nBut hindsight 20/20 - Just because the average performance during a recession was positive, doesn’t mean that the market didn’t go through a brutal drawdown that would have played havoc on emotions. As you can see below, on average, the S&P 500 had close to 30% drawdowns during these recessions.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/339s4ha4hcn81.png?width=708&format=png&auto=webp&s=a948c0d5fca08f329b361487229e09f94f837d2d\n\nThe maximum drawdown was in 2007-09 with **a drawdown of 57%.** Imagine seeing more than half of your portfolio lose value! Even those with nerves of steel would find it hard to not panic sell. But say you did hold on. Then what?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hcuw48cygcn81.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc9866ff39635955c1f931a93d526b1c001c8d27\n\n### After the recession\n\nThis is the most striking insight. After the end of the recession, in just one year, you would have made money in 85% of the cases. And after 3 years, you would have been **in the green in 100% of the cases!**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6uo76o26hcn81.png?width=897&format=png&auto=webp&s=37d3d49b499f5de307aec3a5800028e71e3ab94e\n\nThe rationale behind this is simple - The recession is a time of little hope and bleak prospects, but as investors start hearing news of the economy reopening and businesses growing once more, *the optimism alone is sufficient to drive the market upwards.* The economy can remain sluggish in the aftermath of a recession but the stock market may still be rocketing higher in anticipation of relative improvements.\n\nSince there is no clear indication about how long a recession would last and when a recession is fully over, timing the market would be futile. But buying and holding would have reaped great returns.\n\n**This shows the importance of staying invested.** If you are still feeling adventurous…\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7we3y5dygcn81.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=54e08954afc449af0f9c7499a3bd631794c434b8\n\n### Can you predict a recession?\n\nIf the market has such a close connection with the recession, it might seem like there’s a link between market performance and a future recession. But the reality is that past market performance is a terrible indicator when it comes to predicting a recession.\n\nTake a look at the stats below. Looking at the market returns in the prior 3 and 6 months, it was as likely that the market was positive as it was negative. Also, on average, both 3 months and 6 months’ performance was positive. There wasn’t any way to predict a recession looking at market performance alone.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/brzlyc28hcn81.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=7db68ebad5e7a342327f3100b1182de058b9986e\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9nmj5yoahcn81.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=23ed464227b7367bb472996b5645e97d35fbcdd3\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIt looks like recessions are hard to predict looking at market returns. The volatility of the market is also stressful to stay calm through. But the message is clear looking at past data.\n\nStaying invested in the market regardless of economic conditions gives the best returns, not just over the long term, but in as little time as 3 years. Also, seeing that recessions last anywhere from 12-18 months, it might be a good idea to build an emergency fund that lets you weather over the period without disturbing your investment goals.", "id": "tdwltb", "created_utc": 1647261739.0, "score": 187, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 70, "comments": [{"body": "So what you're telling me is the key to surviving a recession is don't be a paperhanded bitch?", "score": 174, "replies": [{"body": "These hands were made to hold bags.", "score": 40, "replies": [{"body": "I was born holding bags", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Yup", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Buying the fucking dip Chad is what you want to be", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Every day", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I didn’t want to be a paperhanded bitch with GME, now here I am, bagholding.", "score": -1, "replies": [{"body": "That was a bubble.
