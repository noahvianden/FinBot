Those increases happen in ways and at times that you can't predict. They usually happen quite quickly. Lets say you bought FB in the past month at 188: \n\n[https://i.imgur.com/rgxL8hd.png](https://i.imgur.com/rgxL8hd.png)\n\nYou figured it's basically a value stock at this point. You know many folks think it'll go up, but you don't think it will for some time. You sell covered calls at a strike of 200 and earn the premium. It pops up to 229 as it has in the past few weeks. Your shares are called away and you miss out on a 29 per share increase in the stock price. \n\nYou made a small premium, but missed out on a big jump. That jump could have happened after your covered call expiry, in which case you'd win. But it didn't. \n\nIf you're selling covered calls on growth stocks, you're going to make more premium but you're going to miss out on bigger growth opportunities. \n\nIf you sell covered calls on value stocks that tend to trade within a tight band, you won't make much premium because the implied volatility is so low - so even though the likelihood of the stock increasing is much lower, so is the amount you earn from selling a covered call option. \n\nSelling covered calls also adds complexity and costs. So if I was you, I'd consider buying and holding long term and actually benefit from the growth in stock, instead of selling away that growth for a small premium. That way you keep the growth opportunity for yourself, without any costs other than the original transaction fee for the stock purchase. \n\nThere's another factor that your options premiums are taxed as short term capital gains - in other words, ordinary income. If you hold a stock for longer than a year, not only do you benefit from the growth, but your gains are taxed as long term capital gains. \n\nThe problem is that this approach requires patience, a willingness to defer gratification, which is difficult for most people, and does not involve much trading activity, which is also a problem for folks who want to think of themselves as \"traders\". \n\nYMMV.

Even if you intend to hold these forever, things change so it's still good practice to think through how you'd unwind in the worst case scenario.   \n\\-NVDA pays a small dividend, does this factor into the plan at all?   \n\\-Are you looking for any specific balance between these three?

Take some more time and learn and practice selling covered calls so you feel comfortable selling all 7 or 8 contracts.   You will need some liquidity, but here is my opinion.\n\nSell the April 29 contracts with strike as noted above.  Wait a little while after the split, because chances are, the stock will initially rip up before it settles into a normal pattern.  If the stock goes up, roll over your calls to a later date. If stock trades sideways, the time element is on your side. If stock drops, you can but back your contract for a bargain and repeat. (or just let die worthless and do again)  As long as you have liquidity, you can continue to roll over. \n\nNVDA is a different animal. Due to it's volatility, this stock will bring in premium.  Again, as long as you have liquidity, you can sell cc's and roll over those calls should the stock price rise substantially.  If trades sideways, you buy back cheap and repeat, or hold until contract is worthless.   \n\n\nI honestly don't worry about being assigned.  If the contract goes in the money, there's no guarantee you will be assigned.  I neve have been. I recently have a June 17th $150 call trading at $185 and I just bought back the contract for $5,500, pushed back the strike date a month and sold another for $5,500 increasing the strike price to $180.\n\nIf, for some reason you get assigned, just buy back the stock. If you let it get to a spot where it's well over your strike price, shame on you. \n\nThe downside is, you are a long term holder of stock. So pick companies you believe in for the long run.\n\nAs for BABA situation, hopefully people were selling calls on the way down. When it rips up 30%, you roll over.  \nRemember, each time you sell a contract, you put premium in your account.
