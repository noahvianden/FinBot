{"title": "I'm starting to move to Cash", "selftext": "Everyone that says Cash is Trash, obviously doesn't count their stock gains in US dollars.  Inflation maybe closer to 10% than 2%, but that doesn't mean cash isn't useful.  I could for example buy a years supply of food today cheaper than tomorrow.  I could pay off my 3% car loan today and save 3% over paying tomorrow.  Yes, after inflation a 3% loan seems like a good deal over 10% inflation.  But the question you need to ask yourself is where would you put that cash?  Stocks are clearly going thru a dead cat bounce and will go lower after the next interest rate hikes. Dividend stocks give you a bit of insurance, but most divy stocks pay a lower dividend cash flow than inflation.  Non divy stocks require the greater fool to pay more tomorrow than you did today to make a profit.  But with a higher interest rate to get a loan asset prices will begin to fall. The US dollar is debt, and once debt is paid off or destroyed the money supply decreases.  The Fed has decided to crash the economy and stock market to slow inflation.
