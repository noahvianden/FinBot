I'm sure that fluctuates depending on how involved retail is, but not by very much I suspect because in the end big funds have high access to cheap margin debt and bank prop funds act as market makers because, frankly, it's a money printer right now to both control the majority of the shares in the market (and as such control overall price action) AND sell contracts that expire worthless like 85% of the time.\n\nHow the average person saw the Fed meeting: \"Easy money is over. Rate hikes historically crash the market (this is not actually true... only massive rate hikes reliably crash economies and the market goes with them). It's all down from here.\"\n\nHow banks saw the Fed meeting: \"We now know what the balance sheet drawdown will be for the next 2-3 months. We can now input this unknown into our risk calculations and determine how much debt we should release in that quarter.\"\n\nHow funds and investing institutions saw the Fed meeting: \"I now have some sense of how much debt will cost me and whether it works into my profit goals for the next quarter.\"\n\nPeople are overthinking the market, thinking it reflects their personal sentiment on modern financial and economic events. Putting aside the fact that the doom and gloom on the economy is overplayed (to the extent that so-called economists are getting slots on places like CNBC for claiming we're in stagflation and then when being called on the fact that we're not are claiming to have redefined the term...), the fact is that we view things like rate increases from a primary consumer frame... which I do, too, so I'm not calling anyone out on that. And yeah, consumer activity influences the market so that's important to do...\n\n...but we also have to consider that there's another angle. What 2020 proved was that what's happening on Main Street doesn't actually matter that much to the market in the long run, or at the very least it's not the most important factor.\n\nThe most important factor is:\n\n**Liquidity**\n\nAnd not our liquidity, the liquid capital available to institutions.\n\nSo the question everyone has to ask is whether the Fed's actions reduced the amount of money available to funds relative to their expectations, and what the market was saying prior to the Fed meeting was that 50 basis points was possible, and that further balance sheet reductions may have been possible.\n\nBut the Fed added >42% to the M2 pool... and most of it is still sitting in bank reserve funds where bank risk departments haven't largely let it leave to consumers because of their toxic asset ratio concerns during the pandemic and due to unknowns about the Fed. The pandemic is \"ending\" (depending on one's definition) and risks to bank assets are lower than they were before (inflation may change that, we'll see) and the last big unknown: the rate at which the Fed will draw down the balance sheet over the next quarter... is now a known.\n\nAnd that rate hike's like trying to kill an Orca with a bb gun.\n\nThat's a reduction of uncertainty that allows for capital distribution planning and risk calculation... and it allows institutions to reverse course and start generating debt-based investment. During the pandemic, margin went up dramatically at institutions (which is related to the rate reduction and M2 expansion, since those two things work together to promote collateralized lending since that's the least risky for banks.\n\nWhat we just saw since the beginning of the year was a de-leveraging because margin costs became an unknown to institutions combined with a cyclical rotation to reflect a general de-risking based on the traditional growth stock return calculation, which would be impacted by the rate hike curve, and also potentially the bond market since traditional \"wisdom\" says growth trades opposite bond yields... and to be sure, there are people who saw the 10 year T bill go above 2% and bought them up... but that's like any market where there's a demand and once that dries up, it stops being compelling. Some people would rather hold growth than bonds, and people who bought bonds now have nice, safe, boring bond returns they want to leverage against. Bond yield rises lead to risk-off,  but then lead to a risk-on situation because they reduce portfolio risk...\n\nBut something weird is happening to the bond market, and because of QE and now QT, bond yields are going up but bond prices continue to tank... so if you buy into bonds right now, you may lock in a nice yield, but at the cost of potentially losing money on the trade if you have to get out. This is not what's normally happened and it has in part to do with tapering (which has now ended).\n\nThis is also the dynamic messing with the yield curve which is why it's no longer a predictor of recessions. (That doesn't mean people won't manufacture a recession out of a yield curve inversion, but QE basically wiped out the entire thesis for the yield curve as an indicator, which was that the bond market reflected investor sentiment and it doesn't anymore.)\n\nSo add this all up, and what you have is a recipe for a reversal in the market, driven in part by short covering as shorting was almost universally profitable over the past two months, and gamma and vanna events driving continued buying.\n\nThat will eventually stop. When? No one knows... probably whenever institutions are happy with their new positions. I'm not sure I'd bet on going back to ATH, but who knows? I don't know how much fresh capital institutions have access to now. That's the real decider... that and what the quants and machine learning models say they should put into the market.\n\nBut what I can say is that uncertainty will return. Inflation would have hit a calculation inflection point in June prior to the new Cold War starting up, so that is now up in the air depending on how things go... don't trust people who tell you they know how this will shake out, they don't. Nobody does. Nobody on here knows all the moves nations made before the Ukraine invasion to offset market issues... and if they did know, they're not going to tell anyone on here because that would be a state secret because we are now in a war footing.\n\nSo it's a big unknown. I'd bet in inflation getting worse before it gets better now... that June inflection point doesn't matter quite as much now.\n\nAnd uncertainty will return to the market and to institutions as Fed meetings happen, especially if they think the Fed will get more hawkish... so expect lots and lots of chop this year. Uncertainty will drive everything, and which way the market goes will depend on how certainty influences institutional liquidity and projections.\n\nAnd they have a vested interest in keeping the up and down rollercoaster going because they want us buying calls and puts... they want the crack rollercoaster moving, so expect violent moves up AND down keeping us playing. They don't want us constantly profiting from puts. They don't want us predicting the long-term direction... that's bad for them, and they have the capital to not let that happen, and they will use it. People are expecting a capitulation crash here, that's not guaranteed. We may just trade in a 1\\`00 point range on SPY the whole damn year.
