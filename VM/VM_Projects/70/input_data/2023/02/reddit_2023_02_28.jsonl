{"title": "Are non-dividend stocks pure speculation?", "selftext": "Hello guys, this is a post I wrote 220 days ago but couldn’t publish due to a lack of Reddit karma. Funny to see how my examples aged, but my core question is still valid so I post again.\n\nI know this kind of a question has been recently often asked on this sub, but the more I read and the more I get confused.\n\nThe main counter argument that I’ve read is that as a shareholder you actually own a part of the company, which includes its assets but also its cash. That’s true yes, but what can you do from it in reality ? Nothing. We cannot request to trade our stock directly with the company for the asset/cash equivalent. \nThe only options to get money from your stock are :\n- company is bought by another one\n- dividend is distributed \n- you sell higher than you bought.\n\nIf none of the two first options happens, then it seems to be like speculation. You sell higher to someone that expects to also sell higher.\nAlso let’s not forget that companies keep a big part of stocks on their side so they can still control what happens in the company (e.g. dividend distribution).\n\nLet’s take an example : SNAP.\nThe stock selling price has decreased by 90% over a year. \nThere was a time the company was actually profitable with a bright future. It made sense to invest at that time and to expect at some point a return on the investment.\nNow the stock price has dropped and what can you do from it ? Maybe the company is going to oblivion, not able to generate free cash flow anymore until eventually get delisted. And then what ? The only thing I can see is « you should not have invested in this company ».\nOk but what about Google, Amazon etc. Do you say the same ? What if Amazon has the same outcome in few years ? If it starts to fall what can you do ? \n\nNote: I have never owned SNAP stocks.", "id": "11egah5", "created_utc": 1677609785.0, "score": 12, "upvote_ratio": 0.6, "num_comments": 67, "comments": [{"body": "There are several ways a company can return value to shareholders other than pay a dividend. \n\nThey can also buyback stock or invest in the business. All of these options are done from cash flows generated by the business. \n\nSomething like snap doesn't generate free cash. So if you own it, you're speculating on it generating cash flows in the future. Since no one knows for sure when or how much this will be, the stock can be volatile. \n\nIn contrast, a company with a regular, consistent cash flow will be less volatile (in theory). Look at CACI for example. No dividend, but does generate very regular cash flows which it reinvests.", "score": 35, "replies": [{"body": "I do see buybacks as indirect dividends since it is a way to distribute cash to shareholders. I should have mentioned that in my post.\n\nRegarding cash flow, there are a lot of companies that generate it from which we don't see a dime. Taking Amazon as an example, they make huge profit but we have no return (except if the stock value goes up, based on demand/offer). It is even worse since they dilute the number of shares. What if Amazon follows the same trend as Snap? What if their business collapses? We will never see a return on our investment.

In reality, they are just words that make discussion easier. People use the word 'speculation' to indicate riskiness, low probability of success or the lack of a strong thesis and 'investing' for the opposite, but in reality, every investment decision falls on a spectrum and your assessment of it as speculative or not is also subjective and prone to error.\n\nYou ask a lot of what ifs about non-dividend stocks. What if I lose money? What if their business collapses? These questions are all equally valid to ask about dividend paying stocks. You may say that companies that offer dividends or perform buybacks are somehow less risky or more likely to earn you money, but the share price could drop by more than you get from the dividend, resulting in a loss. Just because you got paid a dividend doesn't mean that you gained money.\n\nThere's no such thing as a guarantee. There is some degree of risk in any investment. Plenty of dividend paying stocks have cratered or even gone to zero, causing investors to lose the vast majority of their investment.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Absolutely and I fully agree with your comment.\n\nIt's probably another topic but I think that dividends index in a certain way a stock value. It's rarely the case in the US market since valuation is high, but in Europe we have plenty of stocks in which dividends are 5-10%.\n\nI kind of see it as a loan. You lend money to a company so it can increase its capital, but you expect a return every year. If the dividend is low, but you have hope that it gets bigger due to increased benefits, that's not an issue. But if the company is not growing and only offers a 3% dividend, maybe it's better to invest somewhere else - stock or not (implying the stock is overvalued -> price will automatically decrease).\n\nWhen companies never give dividends/buybacks, you just expect someone else to buy your stock at a higher price until it falls. It's like the hot potato game. That's my concern.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Hmm I'd say it's quite different from a loan. The most important difference is that you're basically free to pull out some or all of your money out at any time (when the market is open) vs a loan where the risk is if the borrower can pay back the loan.\nAlso the money you exchange for shares does not go to the company itself. You're exchanging it for shares from another shareholder on what is essentially like a secondary market. The company sold those share long before and you're basically just trading with other owners.\n\n> When companies never give dividends/buybacks, you just expect someone else to buy your stock at a higher price until it falls. It's like the hot potato game. That's my concern.\n\nA few issues I see with this reasoning. First, the hot potato game analogy is true for all stocks and indeed all investments whether they're dividend paying stocks or not. It may lose value, and you are just expecting that it doesn't irrespective of whether it issues dividends.\n\nSecondly, the word \"never\". You don't know the future, so how can you say never about any stock? All you know is what's happened up until right now. Because a company has never issued dividends in the past does not mean it won't in the future.\n\nCompanies generally follow a lifecycle. In the beginning, they are growing and need to reinvest profits in the business. You wouldn't want a company in this stage to issue dividends because that's not an efficient use of the money. Later on after the company matures, there's less opportunity for growth, so that means the profit coming in can either be held as cash reserves or paid out to shareholders. It makes sense at this point to pay out a dividend, but even if they don't, it doesn't really matter because that money is owned by the company and represents part of its book value, which is what makes up part of the price of the shares you own, and you are free to extract value by selling the stock. Public companies have a legal fiduciary duty to their shareholders, meaning they are bound to make decisions in your financial interest. Basically, the money from those profits generally can't leave the company without enriching you, except through fraud which is illegal. And in the case of fraud, shareholders can bring a lawsuit.\n\nInvesting is basically buying something that you think is worth more than what you're paying for it. The value of what you are buying should be what you are concerned with. If a company is going to do well going forward, it's a good investment whether or not it pays dividends. If it is going to do poorly, it's a bad one, whether or not it pays dividends. So whether or not the company pays dividends is basically irrelevant. The market price of the stock reflects the overall market's opinion on whether or not the company is going to do well. In fact, a stock with a very high dividend yield may indicate the market does not trust that the company has a high likelihood of being able to pay it out.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Eh, speculation is an investment that has no mechanisms to get you anything and the assumption of how you make money is just selling the thing unchanged to someone else for more money.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "It's certainly a risk with companies like Amazon.

Companies with negative earnings but strong margins could theoretically discontinue the growth reinvestment and grow more naturally, but aren't so long as investors are willing to give them more money to grow faster.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "But usually, companies have enough shares to prevent unwanted decisions, either directly or via partnerships.
