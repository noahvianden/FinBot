Goods prices jumped 1.2%, also the largest increase since rising 2.1% in June 2022, led by a 6.2% surge in gasoline cost. The indexes for residential natural gas, diesel fuel, jet fuel, soft drinks, and motor vehicles also moved higher. Conversely, prices for fresh and dry vegetables decreased 33.5%. The indexes for residual fuels and for basic organic chemicals also declined. Meanwhile, services cost edged 0.4% higher, mainly hospital outpatient care (1.4%). The indexes for automobiles and automobile parts retailing; health, beauty, and optical goods retailing; portfolio management; chemicals and allied products wholesaling; and airline passenger services also moved higher.
