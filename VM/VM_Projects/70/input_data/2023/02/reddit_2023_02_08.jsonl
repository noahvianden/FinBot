The limited profit may not seem like a big deal, but it actually is. When selling a CC, you may succeed 10 times in a row, and earn a little extra compared to simply holding the shares, but then there may be a huge run, and you miss out a lot. You say you consider selling options 5-10% OTM.  If you sell a weekly CC 10% OTM, you'd usually get a very small premium, so small that I'd say it's usually not even worth the risk of missing out on a huge run. If you consider selling a CC, I recommend that you look at the option in isolation to decide if it is a trade worth the risk. If there's a 95% chance you can make $35, and a 5% chance you lose $1000, would you take the trade?\n\nPicture this. It's 3 Feb '23, and you hold 100 MSFT shares, trading around 260. You see that you can sell a weekly call at 285 (\\~10% OTM) for around $0.35, and you think \"No way it's going above 285 by next Friday! Free money!\" and sell the call. Then 5 days later, MSFT has continued it's rally, and is now trading at 273, and your short call is now trading at $1.25, and you have a 250% unrealized loss on your option. But you think \"Oh, well. It's still far from 285, I won't close for a loss.\" Then two days later, it's Friday, and wouldn't you know it, Powell said something, or some numbers were published, and MSFT is now trading at 297! (15% up from when you sold the option.) You can now buy back your 285 option at a massive loss, or get assigned and sell your shares for 285. Either way, you have given up on a $1200 gain for a mere $35 premium. You'd have to succeed (not get assigned) on a covered call at $35 premium no less than 35 times just to break even from this!\n\nAnd the thing is, the feeling you get when you imagine selling MSFT at 285 when it is trading at 260 is very different from the feeling you get when you *have to* sell at 285 when it is trading at 297. I think you actually have to experience this yourself before you can really understand this... \n\nCompared to just holding, selling CCs is actually quite a different game, where you have to collect more premium than the gains you miss out on to make it worthwhile in the long run. As in the example above, ONE run past your strike price may wipe out MONTHS of profits from selling covered calls.\n\nAnd then there's the unlimited loss. Your $35 premium is a very small consolation when your stock drops a few dollars. \"But I'm holding the shares anyway!\" You *WERE* holding the shares, but when you sold the call, you gave someone the right to buy your shares at a given price, which means that now, you are actually holding the shares only as long as they stay below a certain price. This may seem like nitpicking, but you have to see the whole picture here. When you're simply holding shares, you have a (nearly) unlimited loss, but you also have unlimited gains, which usually makes it worth the risk in the long run. Once you sell a CC, you give up the unlimited gains, but keep the unlimited loss. \n\nReally understanding all the aspects of selling options is not done in a day, and not all people have what it takes to consistently make a profit from it in the long run.

You don’t get free money. I’m not saying it’s not worth it, or not a sound investment strategy, but I’m arguing that you should have a full picture of the trade and associated risks before you enter the trade. And no trade is without risk…\n\nAlthough there are some similarities with a take profit limit order, it’s not exactly equivalent. The main difference is that you can cancel a limit order, or change the limit, without any costs. This is very useful e.g. if some news from the company are published, if the entire market enters a bull run, or you change your mind for whatever reason. And if the underlying runs past your limit, your shares are sold immediately. On the other hand, if the underlying never goes past your limit, you get nothing.\n\nBut if you sell a CC, you do collect a premium, that you get to keep whether the underlying moves past your strike or not, but you give up all of the above mentioned freedom. If the underlying runs, you probably won’t be able to buy back the CC without taking a loss. And even if the underlying runs past your strike, you must hold until expiration to get assigned and collect the profit (except in the rare case of early assignment). In the meantime, the underlying may also drop back below your strike, in which case you won’t get to sell your shares for a profit as you would have with a pure limit sell order, but instead, you end up with a loss.\n\nIn summary, with a CC, you have much less freedom than with a pure limit order, and are possibly tying up capital for a given period of time.\n\n(And there is also some risk/uncertainty associated with being short options around dividend dates, but I don’t know too much about this...)", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "If you know how to roll this will not be a problem.
