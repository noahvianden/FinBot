{"title": "Big Money Trying to Suppress $BABA Despite Turnaround and Solid Earnings Beat", "selftext": "Wanted to share my thoughts on why Alibaba stock (BABA) is currently undervalued and trending in the opposite direction despite strong earnings release a few days ago. First of all, let's look at the numbers. Alibaba reported a earnings per share beating estimates by 35 cents per share. This is a solid 14% beat and it's no wonder that the stock had strong after hours gains. However, since then, the price has turned back red and is actually down since the release. It's almost as if the market is ignoring the strong earnings release. It's counterintuitive. This stock is already depressed on a valuation basis, 70% over the past year alone - one would imagine a positive beat like this would bring naturally reflect well on a Chinese Blue Chip like BABA.\n\nFrom a fundamental perspective, not only have they laid off more employees than any American Tech company has in the past year (20,000), but its poor trailing performance is mostly due to one-off payments to the CCP for its \"intransigent\" behavior. With that mostly looking like a thing of the past, I would imagine margins will recover significantly in the coming months.\n\n**My theory is that big money is trying to put downward pressure on the stock until the end of the week to try to avoid losing on calls that reflected the positive earnings.** Here's where things get interesting though. Last night, the price of  Alibaba's Hong Kong stock (9988) closed at 90 HKD, but this morning,  BABA was trading at 90$ pre-open (and currently as well). If you don't already know, the two stocks aren't 1:1 equivalent on the two markets. One share of BABA is equivalent to 1.04 x 9988. That's a lot of arbitrage. Unless this stock is a pure downward trend since this oddly positive earnings release, it would look like someone is trying to see this go in the direction they were hoping it would organically (due to a maybe negative earnings release).\n\nAs always, do your own due diligence and make your own decisions. But I've got a few calls here to see whether my theory is right in the coming weeks once the big money clears out it's shorter term calls. Inflation data did seem bad, but that came out today - I can't imagine that is actually what is happening here.\n\nEDIT: So everyone just thinks these numbers are cooked essentially, right? That's what I'm understanding...\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/db1ks0xp88ka1.png?width=1434&format=png&auto=webp&s=96f7b3dba4e75651b7278eb4d427383704586325", "id": "11au1fe", "created_utc": 1677252517.0, "score": 32, "upvote_ratio": 0.65, "num_comments": 80, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|2|**First Seen In WSB**|2 years ago\n**Total Comments**|24|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|5 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\nHey /u/SunshineDeliveries, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.\n>TL;DR: I think BABA is currently undervalued and being artificially pushed down by bigger investors until the end of the week.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Back off Visualmod\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1bldebm067ka1.png?width=1446&format=png&auto=webp&s=b00b276bfcde1694c2a7b9e011ec70b493c955da", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": ">It's possible that you are right and the market is trying to artificially depress the price of Alibaba stock.
