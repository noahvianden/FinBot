{"title": "Dirt Cheap (Fertilizer)", "selftext": " Sup Sluts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 0. TL;DR\n\nSo, basic TLDR; America needs manure and nitrogen rich fertilizer for corn, and there is a current lack of supply. Manure comes from cows, and chickens, and Natural Gas. The best fertilizer (for corn) is the synthetic kind from petroleum and Natural Gas which is at an all time low.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e89byuzqz2ha1.png?width=897&format=png&auto=webp&s=e6c160263b3d9aecfa14ea2ae516d6103f7c3f7c\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 1. Setup\n\nBasically, I got a lot of **shit** on my mind right now and just had to write it down; enjoy. I think I will break this into a few parts that may not seem important or connected, but it is:\n\nSo, here is a 3 year timeline. I tried to get the cursor close to the 24th of Feb 2022, which is the day that Russia invaded Ukraine (Source: Wikipedia). The price of corn jumped because **Ukraine has become one of the 4 major world exporters of corn, on par with Brazil and Argentina**.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe deal is that Russia needs food security and has had a long standing debate over who owns the luscious wheat and corn fields of Ukraine. This fear of scarcity drove the price high, and just like having unprotected sex, the consequences may take almost a year to show up...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 2. Cows & Chickens\n\n[Consequences such as rising beef prices.](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/burgers-steaks-cows-economy-agriculture-department-farming-commodities-investing-analysis-2023-2?op=1) This article attributes the low supply of beef cattle due to the drought in America affecting crops, and the war in Ukraine raising the price of what we feed to fatten up cattle. It's the first article I found that acknowledged by bias, but it is undeniable facts. See, corn is a cheap high energy source that is used alternatively to grass. Cows can't actually eat corn despite having 4 stomachs, unless it is \"cracked\" first. Also, with looming recession and pullback from spending, beef is expected to be in less demand. These reasons are an incentive to a lower cattle head number. We are now at the lowest number of cattle since 1962. I remember back in 1996, beef was just [flying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4a35U3VU1w&ab_channel=bubbafox911) off the shelves. Times change.\n\nThis has also affected chicken prices, but let's take a look at how that is going.... [The bird flu outbreak is the deadliest one in almost 10 years](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ariannajohnson/2023/02/08/avian-h5n1-bird-flu-why-experts-are-worried-and-what-you-should-know/?sh=31123e764d94). Oh no! Not again!\n\nKEY FACTS:\n\n* [According](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/avianflu/index.htm) to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, bird flu is caused by infection of avian influenza A viruses and typically affects aquatic birds (like ducks, pelicans and swans), but can also affect domestic poultry (like chicken and turkey) and other animals, ***including humans***. (getting covid flashbacks?)\n* As of February 1st, the CDC [reports](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/avianflu/avian-flu-summary.htm) the current outbreak has led to one case of human infection (which happened in April 2022), 6,111 wild birds with the disease and over 58 million poultry birds affected—and cases in birds have been reported in every state.\n\nAs you can imagine, the CDC is bringing a bureaucratic murder machine to the chicken ~~camps~~ \"farms\". The threat of another outbreak is something the world can't handle. So get the chicken while it is cheap. I'm not an expert, but I believe it will take a while to replenish the stock of chickens ( and cows) even though a chicken can come to full term within 8-12 weeks (feel free to correct me), I am not betting on limp cocks. I am betting that the CDC's paranoia puts restrictions on farms too early, and lifts them too late.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 3. Corn\n\nSo, we have less cows, and less chickens. Got it. What is the play? I'm getting to it.\n\nTwo days ago, a seemingly harmless article came out from reuters:\n\n[U.S. farmers plan to go 'heavy on corn' in 2023](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/us-farmers-plan-go-heavy-corn-2023-despite-risks-2023-02-06/). There is actually a lot of [other](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cf-industries-cf-signs-mou-123412629.html) [articles](https://www.midwestfarmreport.com/2022/11/26/corn-and-soy-planning-for-2023/) [similar](https://www.farmprogress.com/commentary/usda-projects-uptick-in-2023-corn-acreage) to this, but the idea is that Corn prices will remain elevated, might as well capitalize on it.\n\nCorn is going to be switched out for soybeans. This is part of [crop rotation](http://corn.agronomy.wisc.edu/AA/A014.aspx) and it is vital knowledge fore restarting the human race after apocalypse. Corn and soybean are often switched out to replenish soil health. This changes some things. First, whatchya need ta know about corn is, it is a thirsty crop. The second thing is also requires a lot of nitrogen. It is like corn steroids. This is what is in industrial fertilizer for corn.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 4. Fertilizer\n\nSo, where does nitrogen rich fertilizer come from? Natural Gas and cow/chicken shit. [Here is one article that avoids talking about how you can make bombs](https://www.pioneer.com/us/agronomy/common_n_fertilizers_stabilizers.html). Finally, I can get to the play.\n\nFarmers are going to need barrels of fertilizer for the soybean rotation and capitilization of ukrainian strife. Because soy beans also deplete nitrogen from the soil, it needs to be re-added. Depending on existing levels, it takes about 180 to 280 pounds per acre; a shit-load if you will, and with 58 million chicken cloacae, and cow assholes wiped off this earth, they will need to turn to industrial petro/fertilizer companies for the juice. **Luckily for them, natural gas is at an all time low!**\n\nWhat we have right now is a perfect frickin' storm for fertilizer companies and it's been right under our noses.\n\n* Natural Gas is cheap, implying low cost to make ammonium based fertilizer\n* Competition of manure has been depleted due to avian flu and economic ripples of europes bread basket\n* High demand as the soybean crop rotates out and the corn crop cometh\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat we need to find is a company that makes nitrogen rich fertilizer (as opposed to potash which is potassium). Although I will include $SOIL just because corn needs phosphorus and potassium as well. It also helps if they aren't Russian or European. Although Russia makes a lot of fertilizer, they are under tightening sanctions, and Europe is in a ammonia/natural gas drought. Currently the Alberta region of Canada is the main exporter of petroleum based agricultural fertilizer. I would probably focus there and American companies. Also, if you thought it couldn't get worse for Europeans:\n\n* [U.S. nitrogen exports jump as Europe scrambles for fertilizer](https://www.yahoo.com/now/u-nitrogen-exports-jump-europe-051055747.html)\n* [High Gas Prices Force UK Fertilizer Plant ($CF) to Shut for Good](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-08/high-gas-prices-force-uk-fertilizer-plant-to-close-for-good)\n\nSo far, there is: $ICL and $CF. There are a lot of mining companies and petroleum companies who don't seem to have fertilizer as their primary focus. I don't think the market has priced in the that the low cost of natural gas, and the incoming demand of fertilizer, and the drop in competition.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[$ICL chart after 2 years.

Here in the Midwest, more fertilizer went on last fall than I’ve probably seen in the last 10 years…partly due to the fact that it was a tad cheaper than last year, and also because possession is 9/10ths of the law and it was a hedge in case something happened to the supply chain as has happened the last couple of years.
