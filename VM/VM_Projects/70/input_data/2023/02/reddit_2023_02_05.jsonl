What does this mean? Buy silvergate stocks? Short means they gamble on the stockprice going down, and a short squeeze is when ppl buy the stock and the price is going up, right?", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "When a stock is heavily shorted it means investors borrowed shares from a shareholder , then sold those shares, promising to return them at a later date and made money at whatever price he sold it at. Because they have to eventually return these shares, they sold them hoping to buy them back at a later date for a cheaper price. However, if the price of the stock increases between the time they sold the shares and when they must return the shares, they lose money, because the shares they sold are now more expensive and they still have  to buy them back to return them.\n\nTo put it simply i borrow your phone, promise to return it in a year, i sell it for $200 that day, a year later and your phone is cheaper on the market and i buy it back for $150. That‚Äôs $50 profit. However if a year later your phone increases in price after I sold it, to let‚Äôs say $250, now i have to buy that phone back for $250 and i lost $50. \n\nA squeeze is when investors know a stock has a high number of shares shorted (borrowed and sold) that need to be bought back. A squeeze is when investors then decide to buy a large amount of shares of the shorted stock to greatly increase the price of the stock, in order to force the short-sellers to buy back at a higher price.", "score": 20, "replies": [{"body": "![img](emote|t5_2th52|27189)", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "Thank you for the explanation!

It‚Äôs essential to have some large form of monetary backing in order for a squeeze to work. While the one i suggested may, i would suggest going with a less risky option, for example maybe go with the top trending ticker right now which would be carvana (CVNA) However, if you‚Äôre still learning, as you say you are, i highly suggest using a very small amount of money. That way when and if you eventually lose (as we all do in the beginning at some point) you can learn from your potential mistakes while still having money left over to try again with your newfound knowledge.
