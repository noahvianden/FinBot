{"title": "Inflation question -- Who/what is driving up demand?", "selftext": "When we first started raising rates, I could get behind why the consumer (then) was likely behind rising inflation.\n\nHowever, fast forward to today with rates where they are at, I'm not sure I still believe it's the consumer driving up demand. Not only is your average consumer making significantly less then they did last year, but for many, affording some of the most basic shit is now a struggle. I refuse to believe it's the money received for COVID either. Not only was that TWO years ago, but for many of us, that money was gone within a month.\n\nSo, I'm curious, *who exactly is behind demands' increase?*\n\n* Which sector, corporation or group of people are consuming and demanding loads of money to the extent we're seeing today?\n* Is it really just consumers spending recklessly?\n* Or is there another element to this that many people don't know?\n\nI don't want to completely dismiss the consumer's role in all of this, but the more I think about all this, the more I start to think it's something else. If anything, possibly the government itself and its ability to [pay off debt by printing money](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/15qe45u/us_economics_101/). That and or large corporations unaffected by rates where they are at.\n\n*When I look at the governments insane interest payment due as a result of its debt, I can't help but wonder how much the federal government behind inflation itself.* If the federal government can pay off its debt by printing money--money that subsequently increases supply and in turn lowers the value of the dollar--how much of inflation is impacted by the government's printer?\n\nThat and reckless spending by the government as well?\n\n# TLDR\n\nNot sure if consumer demand is the sole reason behind inflation.

When it was time to work they felt like they couldn’t work for less then there hand out from the government in fact they want more. \n\n3 The cost of homes went high because people could afford them with low interest rates. This caused the rents to go up. There’s a rule in rentals 1% so a house valued at $250,000 rents for $2,500 a month. I’m a landlord this is how I do it too. \n\n4 because people will not work for the same wages as before Covid and the hand out wages have gone up to stay in business and are past on to consumers. \n\nSo here’s what’s not happening. Rents are not going back down much or at all. Wages are not going back down either. Which means cost of goods and services will not go back down either.

Almost every good that reaches a consumers hand has been shipped by a truck and diesel is super high right now.  Oil a few months ago was $63 roughly and is now $80+.  That is a 30% increase.

Every transaction has a buyer and a seller and money changing hands; the money that used to be the buyer's is now the seller's.  When people talk about the value of their bank account, it's just a contractual obligation: the actual money has been deposited in the bank, and then loaned out to lots of other people, who have spent it on houses and home improvements and cars and business equipment and salaries.  When people talk about the value of their stock portfolio, it's just the number of shares they own times the average price per share that the market is currently trading at.  Prices go up and down depending on supply and demand, and net worths go up and down with them.\n\nWhen the government \"prints\" money, they're usually not actually printing money.  The Fed is dropping interest rates to incentivize banks to make more loans, which makes more money flow out into the overall economy.  With more loans, more people buy more things, and economic output goes up.  If there aren't enough things to buy, more people instead spend more money to buy the same things, and we call that inflation.\n\nWhen you say \"your average consumer making significantly less then they did last year\", you're talking about real dollars, the amount of stuff they can buy with their salaries.  But that's begging the question when you speak about inflation.  Inflation is always measured in nominal dollars, because real dollars divide out the inflation rate to get the amount of real stuff you can purchase.  And people aren't actually making less: they're making *more dollars*, but the dollars are buying less.  Their salaries are just going up at less than the rate of inflation.\n\nWho's making more than the rate of inflation, and profiting from it?  Anyone switching jobs - the average job switcher got a 13-15% raise, compared with a 4.5% raise for the average wage.  Anyone who is compensated in stock - the stock market is up \\~60% from 2020.  Anyone  who invested in the right stocks.  Anyone in cryptocurrency - Ethereum was $125 in 2020, now it's $1800.  Anyone who bought a house in 2020 with a 3% interest rate and now sees it worth 60% more at a 7% interest rate while they collect 5% on their savings account.

Unemployment is at an all time low. More people have jobs than ever. And, they have more job satisfaction. That means they are making more money. \n\nInflation was terrible in 2021-2022, but is slowing. Gasoline costs over $1 less than a year ago,  for example. Even rents and housing prices are beginning to come down, a little. \n\nBidenomics is working. The other political party’s formula for economic success, tax cuts for the super rich, has failed miserably, and all economists agree. There is no trickle down.\n\nThe causes of inflation have to do with international forces of supply and demand. It is not all about the US consumer, although prosperity in America does help to keep prices high.\n\nYou cannot understand inflation by looking only at one commodity, but you can use the price of one —  oil and the related commodity of US gasoline as an example of how inflation begins, accelerates, and begins to slow. \n\nPeople like to talk about how cheap gasoline was in April - December 2020. Was it cheap because Trump was in office? Or was it cheap because there was no demand for it when everyone was essentially a shut-in, nobody was traveling, theaters, restaurants and bars were shuttered, and most folks worked from home? \n\nI’ll go with the latter. \n\nWhen the Covid pandemic gripped the world, and businesses shut down across the globe, the demand for oil plummeted sharply. At one point, the spot price of oil was negative because it was more expensive to store it in a tanker offshore, then its value on the marketplace. Then, starting in 2021, as the world economy roared back to life, demand for oil shot up, just a sharply as it is at went down in 2020. \n\nPrice is determined by the balance between supply and demand. When demand falls, sellers lower their prices to try to attract what customers they can. When demand skyrockets, sellers can raise the price of the suddenly scarce commodity. \n\nThis is not politics. It is Econ 101.\n\nAnother feature of the see-saw prices in oil that bear on inflation is supply. Covid caused a lot of disruptions in the supply chain. There were tankers and container ships lined up at the port in Los Angeles for weeks, without ability to get into the port, because of the sudden crush of demand and the shortage of workers. The supply chain disruptions acted to drive up price after the world economy brought back. Less supply= higher prices. Inflation was inevitable. In fact, our inflation is much more muted than that in Western Europe. The United Kingdom has about 10% a year inflation, far higher than ours.\n\nAs the kinks in the supply chain began to get worked out, the balance between supply, and demand started to smooth out, and that is why you are seeing a drop in prices at the pump. No, gasoline is not cheap. But it is over a dollar cheaper than it was a year ago. Inflation was rising in 2021 in 2022, but its rate has been decreasing in 2023.\n\nAnd, as many other comments, have alluded to, American corporations used the excuse of inflation to jack up prices. Grocery prices reflect this. This is because we do not have a strong Consumer Protection bureau in this country. It was gutted under Trump. If we had someone like Elizabeth Warren, in charge of consumer protection, you would not see this price gouging. \n\nThe pain of the American public is directly result of how the American public has voted. They have voted for Republicans, at least enough to have divided government and gridlock. The Republicans can veto almost anything that the Democrats want to do. It takes 60 votes in the Senate to get past a filibuster. Republicans hold the House. \n\nThis affects both parties, depending on who is in charge. But that is why we do not see things change. Things remain the same when they need to change. The is for people to get out and vote their pocket books instead of their prejudices or the lies they were told on Facebook or the big lie channel. \n\nRemember that the same large corporations that want to raise prices on you over and over again are bribing the politicians with massive campaign contributions. The Republicans made this possible with the disastrous Supreme Court decision called Citizens United, which is in effect legalize bribery. We have so many reasons to vote them out and vote them out decisively. \n\nI’m a 67-year-old white capitalist and business owner. I would be called a job creator on Fox “News.
