All returns are net of fees.\n2. All returns are net of deposits, withdrawals.  Since 2011, I've made $1.2M in additional deposits, and have made $1.25M in withdrawals. Deposits reflect cash earned from W2 and / or emergency injections to address margin calls. Withdrawals reflect taxes and down payments for home purchases.\n3. These results reflect all options trading across both IRAs, reg-T, portfolio margin, and span margin accounts. In 2011 about 20% of the investable assets were in an option-trading IRA (requires cash-margin trading) and in 2023 about 40% of the investable assets are in IRAs and 60% is in portfolio / span margin trading accounts.\n4. In 2011, I started trading options with E\\*Trade. I moved to IBKR in 2012 and have been with TDA / TOS since 2016.  While IBKR offers better tools, their auto-liquidation algorithms are not worth the risks.  I have been auto liquidated on some occasions and it always happens at a time that costs money.  With TDA, they give you a trading day or two to make adjustments or deposit cash so that I can trade out of any situation favorably.\n5. In 2011, the funds invested reflected 70% of my net worth with little equity in my then home. In 2023, the funds invested reflect 35% of my net worth, as I carry no home mortgage and 50% of my net worth is locked up in equity (venture capital, angel investments, and other mechanisms where I cannot control liquidity). \n6. While I don't keep track of every event, over 13 years, there has been approximately $75K in losses, reflecting about 10% of the starting capital, and about 1.5% of my current capital due to: auto-liquidation, forgetting to adjust 0DTE options that could not easily be reopened at the same price on the following trading day, having to make \"unnatural\" adjustments to avoid or recover from a margin call situation.  Avoiding these issues by paying more attention would probably have had a 5% total positive impact vs. where I am at now.\n\n**Trading Strategies Employed**\n\nMy general strategy has been to maximize risk-adjusted theta.  Over time, my definition of risk-adjusted has evolved, but I parameterize it as \"being able to survive a 40% drop or 10% spike in markets prior to making an adjustment\".  While many people consider their NLV that would exist in these situations, the reality is that you have to account for changes in IV and your broker's margin requirements as you will encounter margin calls long before your NLV is threatening extension when selling volatility.\n\nThis sequencing reflects the basic evolution of how I approached selling options:\n\n1. 6 months: Cash-secured puts against F50 companies.\n2. \\~6 months: 30-day Iron Condors against SPY and SPX.\n3. \\~7 years: 1:7 put:call max-leverage short strangles against the SPX, RUT, NDX.  Towards the end of this cycle increasingly only did SPX.  There were periods in here where I saw distortions in futures and sold 1:1 put:call strangles against gold, silver, currencies, treasuries, cattle and metals. For the most part, at least 75% of my investable funds were around SPX.  While markets bleed up, they don't crash up.  They do crash down. I started selling short strangles with the heavily leveraged naked calls far OTM. These would generally be 7DTE with early and aggressive adjustments for any calls or puts that are threatened.  This worked very consistently with opening call positions at .05 delta and adjusting them as early as .2 delta.  This worked well until it didn't work well. It was multiple years before I had my first experience with calls going ITM even with the aggressive rolling adjustments. Being max leveraged and having 100s of calls go ITM, was a learning lesson - both on how to trade out of such a situation, and the importance of adjusting the algorithm to avoid these sorts of issues.\n4. 3 years: 2:5 put:call nominal-leverage short strangles intermixed with ATM strangles based upon certain IV parameters that I was monitoring. These strangles were closer to 0-2 DTE as MWF expirations were more common. This was an adjustment to try and take stronger advantage of more frequent expirations that were appearing. This proved to be pretty dumb as this trading was working through 2020 when I started layering on my ATM short strangled.  There were some vicious V-shaped recoveries that occurred right as put those on.  And then after massive corrections and V-shaped bouncing, 2021 proved to be a relentless march upward.  I spent most of 2021 working to unwind many deep ITM calls that were losing money.  My approach is to continually roll & adjust, but to not close out losing positions. I attribute about 2/3 of the 2021 losses to the straddle idiocy - these losses would not have materialized using the approach I am trading now.\n5. Current:  I have a calendar ladder of 2:5 put:call strangles that span 0DTE, 30 DTE, 365 DTE.  I'll probably start spreading this ladder across more expirations including 14 DTE and 180 DTE.  This has driven a couple of core benefits: a) the NLV doesn't oscillate as much when the markets make a 2 std deviation move, and b) I pull in more cash earlier from the 365 DTE options selling which can be moved into box trades earning interest.   \nWith the market relentlessly moving up in June and July, I only experienced a total portfolio draw down of 7%.  Had I been trading one of the earlier algorithms, it would have been a 20-25% draw down instead. In June, July my 0 and 30 DTE strangles went ITM while my 365 DTE strangles have stayed safely OTM (they have subsequently all moved OTM) with August being a 9% total return MTD.   \nAdditionally, all cash, which is about 110% of my NLV, is moved into box trades that are currently paying about 5.5% or into deep ITM covered calls on high quality stocks where the annual rate is \\~15%. \n\nFootnotes:\n\n1. 1.  I trade Iron Condors instead of strangles in my IRA account, for obvious reasons.\n2. 2. Most of the deep ITM covered calls land in the IRA account since they are <1-year horizons and I don't want short term capital gains.\n3. 3. I have gravitated towards SPX due to a) huge numbers of analysts with careful predictive abilities on where the price will head, b) European style options, c) favorable tax treatment, d) massive volume, e) wide range of strikes and expirations that are essential to digging out of any trading holes.\n\n**Commentary**\n\nHistorically, my average return has been 15%, with a standard deviation of 26%.  If you run some monte carlo simulations with 26% standard deviation, you have some unattractive swings.  It was these swings where I moved to having more of a calendar ladder of strangles, with different strangles being managed (rolled, adjusted) differently.  It's my expectation that I get closer to 20% returns average with a standard deviation of 20% going forward.\n\nIt's arguable that the risk : reward is not worth it, especially when comparing the SP500TR numbers form the past decade.  But the past decade was exceptionally low interest rates with high liquidity fueling one of the most powerful bear markets ever.  My outlook for the next 10 years is more neutral, and a strangle selling strategy should outperform more consistently the market.\n\nIron Condors have generally underperformed naked strangles, but ICs are required in the IRA. Iron Condors are difficult and costly to adjust and roll, especially if you have a position that has gone ITM.\n\nMany algorithmic traders will close any position when their price or loss hits a certain threshold.  I've generally been more comfortable with rolling, adjusting, and awaiting price reversals rather than closing a losing position that re-opens a new strangle at new strikes.  I am fairly certain that closing and reopening new strangles with new strikes is probably - long term - more profitable than my adjust / roll process but haven't done the mathematical analysis.  An algorithmic approach that closes and reopens when a certain loss has been hit would require a lot more constant management, setting stop losses, and being quick to re-open new positions to avoid losses from a reversal.  If I ever retire where I can manage my trading as a full-time job, I will do the work to analyze closing at a loss vs. rolling / adjusting.\n\nNaked calls are scary until you have had a batch go ITM.  Once I learned how to roll / adjust / compensate, the fear that comes from having positions go ITM abates.  You realize that while your NLV doesn't like naked calls going ITM, you also realize you have the tools and skills to adjust through and generate profit while doing it.  These adjustments are why 2022 was such a stellar year, as the payoff from adjustments made in 2021 were realized when the market corrected.\n\nOne key element of this strategy is that I am 100% invested all of the time. I always have my strangles open.  The only question is how many strangles I can keep open given my risk :: reward profile, as stated at the beginning.  I don't believe in trying the time the market, so have shied away from choosing stocks, playing with unpredictable commodities, or working with indexes that don't have a lot of analyst support like RUT.  I do choose stocks with some of my deep ITM covered calls, but I see those as almost risk-free alternatives that offer a higher return to investing in box trades. \n\nI am sure I will get asked about how many put :: call strangles I open given an account size.  It varies based upon how far the expirations are, but to give you a general sense, for a $1M account, there would be either 2 or 3 open strangles (ie, \\~ 15 calls and 6 puts open at any given time) with the SPX trading at $4400.  When msot of my strangles are far OTM, TDA will indicate that about 40-50% of my option buying power is being used.  When some of my calls are under pressure, this increases to 60%.  When the market ran up aggressively in July, all of my calls were under pressure, it got to 90%.  If it had gotten to 95%, I would have to take some more aggressive rolling / adjustment maneuvers.\n\nMy computer setup is very basic - real time tickers for SPX.  I have been trading it for so long that just glancing at current SPX value and I can guess my portfolio NLV, the value of all puts and calls that are open, and whether I should adjust.  I have TOS in a configuration that I like to make it easy to adjust and scan SPX options. I have studied GEX / VEX attributes and if I ever retire and trade full time, I will use something like SpotGamma to help pinpoint tighter ranges for price action to juice 0DTE returns.  That is just thinking about the future.\n\nI tried long options from time to time, but I cannot predict price direction. It's always felt like gambling to me.

I suppose like many people, I had dreamed of maybe leaving the workforce and wanted to know if income generation could be a substitute.  \n\nTo achieve suitable income, my early strategies were probably more aggressive than they needed to be - higher leverage, more options volume at lower owning deltas.  Much higher success rates but when things go sour, they do so in extreme ways.\n\nAs I have had more success in options, I have had equally more success in my career, and subsequently any desires to leave the workforce have diminished.  My work and career responsibilities have intensified along with offering nearly 4x the income I was obtaining when I started trading options.\n\nThis has given me less time to focus on options and so I have trended to favoring positions that do not require hour by hour hovering of positions.  Perhaps the results will have a lower expectation, but so far the adjustments with having a calendar of strangles has seemingly both required a lot less time to manage and kept or improved my expected rate of return.\n\nThere are periods where I take extended vacations and have time by a pool in an exotic location where I can kill time.  I have aggressively traded strangled at 0DTE, and found that it can be extremely profitable as long as you monitor the price action throughout the day to ensure the price remains bounded.  \n\nIt seems very plausible that an options trader who wants to stay at 0DTE and can aggressively adjust when price moves could potentially make 3-4% each month.  There are a number of traders lurking here who claim these type of results.  This would be less about leveraging theta, though that is a factor, but more about being an options swing trader trying to maximize the theta burn that comes from having tight positions around price as the day wanes.\n\nSo if you look at this as a type of bounded exercise - low monitoring, low adjustment theta plays should net 8-12% per year and those that aggressively mange and do options swing trading with theta could see up to 50%.\n\nI talk about my annual expected value is 20%, but happy with any year that generates 10%.  I have to do some calculations but I think I need about 7% to have options income cover my current lifestyle after taxes owed.  Years where I beat that along with my job income work to increase the base of capital for which income generation can be executed.\n\nWith my historical average at 15% and a market outlook favorable for options strangles, I am fairly optimistic on what will happen over the next 10 years.\n\nAs for those who say that the risk and effort hasn't been worth it vs just getting the same return from buy and hold - I disagree with that posture.  There were losses and learning lessons from the past years which could only have occurred from experience and trading.  Taking those losses and still matching the market is immeasurable.  To have gained that experience while effectively just matching the market during one of the strongest bull markets of all time is immeasurable in value.  When the market has unremarkable returns for a long stretch, these lessons should cause massive outperformance versus buy and hold.  Additionally, while I could have made a lot more just investing into Tesla or Apple for the same period - I am not good at stock picking and to have stock concentration risk for stocks that are overvalued would just have my mind running circles, likely causing me to have sold way way way too early leaving upside on the table.  Directionless strategics eliminate the need for that analysis which is helpful to how I like to think about markets.  Finally, my day job is running companies and my salary and other equity is very very very long tech, so having my strangle strategy be mostly short the market with heavily short calls is  a type of anti correlation that offers a form of diversification for my portfolio.", "score": 7, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Tyler, that you again?", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Need TLDR", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "13 years of trading for a extremely small outperformance vs sp500", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "Damn", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Facts.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "So small that by the time you consider fees and taxes it isn‚Äôt worth the time and risk", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Great post and everything is logical/makes sense.
