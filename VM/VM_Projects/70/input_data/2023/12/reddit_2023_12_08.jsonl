{"title": "Why NIO Inc is Undervalued", "selftext": " \n\n**Why NIO is undervalued.**\n\nA lot of people take a look at the daily or weekly chart and go back to the beginning of NIO‚Äôs IPO and see that the stock rose to about 60 bucks and then dropped all the way down to the price today which is about 8 bucks.\n\nI‚Äôd like to point out a few things that maybe haven‚Äôt been considered or given the right amount of weight when evaluating NIO and its potential growth.\n\nHere‚Äôs my case as to why I believe NIO is undervalued. I will keep it simple and only focus on the biggest pieces that I believe make NIO a unique business with a long successful lifespan ahead of it.\n\n**\\*\\*I spared you all the pain of reading hundreds of details about each point. I simply think a mention of the feature would be easier to digest on a quick read.\\*\\***\n\n1. NIO has a clear and achievable vision.\n   1. NIO‚Äôs vision focuses around sustainability. They place a lot of focus on this and it shows in their business model and actions. For example, NIO doesn‚Äôt have a dealership network. They sell their cars via an app. The interior of their cars include recycled water bottles and they are also involved with green initiatives in the Sanjiangyuan area. Furthermore, they are a member of the UNGC - The United Nations Global Compact.\n2. NIO‚Äôs research and development has already paid off and will continue to do so.\n   1. NIO developed the ability to swap out a depleted car battery in under 3 minutes. This is something that Tesla has not either considered doing or been able to do.\n   2. The cars NIO has developed are not only stylish, but technologically advanced. They feature AI assistance integrated in the dashboard along with state of the art exterior sensors that enable AI driving.\n   3. NIO‚Äôs cars offer not only one or two drive modes, but nine.\n3. Ultimately, NIO has a diverse pool of talent spanning all over the world.\n   1. NIO has R&D departments in Silicon Valley, Beijing, Copenhagen, and many more places. NIO‚Äôs talent spans across the globe and because of this, the company benefits greatly from differing perspectives and cultures.\n   2. This is NIO‚Äôs biggest strength. Any problem that may arise will have an opportunity to be solved as there are multiple kinds of people from very different backgrounds tackling the issue.\n\n**So what is NIO considering doing now to improve their business model and ultimately their profits?**\n\nNIO is thinking about a spin-off. They are playing with the idea of separating their money-losing battery business into its own entity to better their financial situation. This would be amazing. Other companies have done this too. McDonalds created Chipotle. Ebay spun off PayPal after they bought it. Other big companies have done the same.\n\nNIO‚Äôs cars are priced to sell. The average price for their cars is from 25k to 45k which is amazing when you look at the features and the specs of these cars. They are absolutely beautiful cars and are priced very reasonably. In my opinion, Teslas are outdated in comparison.\n\nI know that NIO hasn‚Äôt been profitable BUT, NIO is a new company that literally just started nine years ago. It is a very young, innovative, and refreshing company that has so much potential I can‚Äôt wait to see where it goes.\n\nAs for me, I can‚Äôt wait to see NIO in the U.S where I am convinced it will be received with very positive reviews. Lucid Motors is extremely expensive, Rivian is also expensive and poorly designed, and Tesla has yet to demonstrate any innovation or production ability.\n\nSo let me finish this off by summarizing and stating why NIO is undervalued.\n\nNIO is a great company with a clear vision that is focused on providing modern, beautiful, technologically advanced AI intelligent cars to everyone, not just the wealthy.\n\nNIO‚Äôs stock price has hit the floor and is now showing signs of a bull run. It has grown +10% in the last week! How is nobody seeing this??? At its current price of $7.85 NIO is a steal.\n\nI‚Äôm bullish on NIO. I‚Äôll be betting on NIO for the next few years.

They showcased an impressive video demonstrating Gemini's capabilities, but it turns out the video was mostly faked.

This has led to doubts about the speed, accuracy, and real capabilities of Gemini. Although Gemini can still do some of the things shown in the video, it's not exactly as portrayed.
