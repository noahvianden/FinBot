To go long 3,000 shares at today‚Äôs close would cost 1.4MM.\n\nWith the LEAPs set up, they start selling monthly calls. 0.1 delta CC nets approx 10k monthly for an 11% annual return. 0.3 delta CC nets 35k monthly for a 37% annual return.", "score": 117, "replies": [{"body": "I need someone to read this for me .

Here's a breakdown of the key terms and concepts:\n\n1. **Deep In-The-Money (ITM) LEAPS**: LEAPS are options contracts with an expiration date longer than one year. \"Deep In-The-Money\" means the strike price of the option is significantly below (for calls) the current market price of the underlying asset. This type of option behaves more like the underlying stock due to its intrinsic value.\n\n2. **Paul Pelosi's Strategy**: The text mentions Paul Pelosi (presumably referring to the husband of Nancy Pelosi, the U.S. Speaker of the House) using this strategy. It's speculated that he uses deep ITM LEAPS on stocks with high liquidity and high implied volatility (IV).\n\n3. **Options Chain and Volume**: The options chain is a list of all the available options contracts for a particular stock, showing their strike prices and volumes. The mentioned volume of 29 at the 120 strike and 1 at the 130 strike suggests these are the contracts bought.\n\n4. **Cost Basis**: This refers to the total amount invested in the options. The text estimates a cost of $1.13 million to control 3,000 shares through the options, compared to $1.4 million if buying the shares outright at the current market price.\n\n5. **Selling Monthly Calls (PMCC)**: This is part of a strategy known as the Poor Man's Covered Call (PMCC). After buying the LEAPs, monthly call options are sold against them. This generates income (premiums from selling the calls) while controlling the stock with less capital.\n\n6. **Delta and Annual Return**: Delta represents the rate of change in the option's price compared to the underlying asset's price. A 0.1 delta means the option's price changes by 0.1 units for every 1 unit change in the stock price. The text suggests selling calls with deltas of 0.1 and 0.3, estimating annual returns of 11% and 37%, respectively, based on the premiums earned from selling these calls.\n\nThis strategy is a form of leveraging options to control more shares with less capital while generating income through selling calls. However, it involves significant risk, especially due to the long duration and the potential for significant losses if the underlying stock moves unfavorably. This strategy is typically employed by more experienced traders with a high tolerance for risk.", "score": 39, "replies": [{"body": "Cannot read longer than 1 sentence sorry .
