Of course, that would make BTC 1.0 worthless. So what?  \nWell, if BTC 1.0 becomes worthless and BTC 2.0 is essentially the same thing that would prove BTC 2.0 is also worthless. THAT means BTC 1.0 was *always* worthless. \n\nPeople compare BTC to a limitless fiat currency like the U.S dollar which is subject to inflation. You know what didn’t become noticeably more valuable as inflation increased?  BTC. Why? Because the value of BTC is measured in U.S. dollars. If BTC was a safe hedge against inflation then demand would have sky rocketed over the last year or two.  It didn’t. \n\nFinally, yes - the U.S. dollar is just paper backed by nothing. But it is a fiat currency and that is all that is needed to make it valuable. If BTC were to become a fiat currency in the US then that changes things considerably.

Every CPU out there has gold conductors.   I saw a thing about a guy that just collects old circuit boards and CPUs and uses chemicals to dissolve everything leaving tiny amounts of gold which add up when done on a large enough scale.\n\nGold has a lot of utilitarian purposes but I think the conductivity of it is probably the biggest one.\n\nEDIT:  Also, you can't just *make* gold.  It is finite and has been desireable since the beginning of time.  Bitcoins are just strings of alpha-numeric characters.  Yes, Bitcoin has a finite supply.  But someone could essentially just create Bitcoin 2 and have it do the exact same thing.  Etherium is a perfect example.  \n\nThink of it this way - if some extremely rich person or persons were to buy up all the Bitcoins ever, what good would they be?  They would be worthless.  The world wouldn't miss a beat without them.  Maybe we would be like \"fuck you, we are just going to create a new Bitcoin service since alpha-numeric strings can be created by a cat walking on a keyboard.\n\n  However, if someone were to buy up all the gold in the world then the gold would still be in demand for anything from jewelry to CPUs.  The demand wouldn't diminish at all since gold actually has a tangible value.  Bitcoin has no such inherent value aside from demand itself.   I've said the block chain technology likely has value but the block chains themselves - $35,000 for what exactly?\n\nEDIT 2:  I'll say this - maybe I am wrong, maybe bitcoins do have some kind of inherent value outside of being used in ponzi schemes, a way for various coin companies to act as banks without the transparency that real banks are required to have.  Bitcoins are probably valuable as long as scam artists have coin companies that are backed with bitcoin (or so they say) but really they just pocket the money.  It is all money laundering.  FTX is a *perfect* example of this.  The Bitcoin industry is like the 2008 housing market on crack.
