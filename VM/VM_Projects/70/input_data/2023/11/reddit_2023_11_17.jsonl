Given we live in a world where government deficits are unsustainable and central banks having repeatedly shown their willingness to support reckless fiscal spending it would be a little silly to assume with confidence that the Fed will stick to its 2% inflation target. Stocks however should act as an inflation hedge, so buying cash rich companies with a large moat is a good way to reduce risk right now.\n\n\\- The 7 have huge daily inflows from passive buyers of market weighted indexes like the S&P500 and lack sellers due to the factors above.

But the truth is, so much of what it takes to uncover those abilities at the right age, nurture them sufficiently, and then put you or I in an environment where those talents will be discovered and celebrated is enormously dependent on timing and circumstance- i.e., luck. So ordinary society will almost never be able to play much of a role in the process. And charlatans will always be along their own special bell curve of success. Theranos fooled billionaires. Trump fools my day-drunk, conspiracy theorist neighbor, Ricky. \n\nI like what you’re saying about not getting jealous of others for their success or being too hard on ourselves.
