They have at least 12 years of competitive products with good margins and a shot at tailoring their transition faster or slower depending on the conditions on the ground.\n\nNow let me try to address your point about the possibility that the market experience a sudden acceleration in 2-3 years. There is indeed a possibility that we will experience and ICE collapse in the next 3 years due to financial issues with legacy automakers. Their finances are backed by capital investment in factories, patents and leased vehicles. Factories are already underutilized making their intrinsic value dependent on the \"hope\" of a rebound of the ICE car sales.  Plenty of \"adverse\" factors have been listed in the past two/three years, but we are running  out of \"excuses\" and it really seems that a PHEV/BEV revolution is happening.  If this is confirmed , the three pillars value of legacy ICE industries, factories patents and leased vehicles may become \"questionable\" for the financial markets.\n\nWe all witnessed very strange claims from multiple automakers that \"their factories are flexible to produce both ICE and NEV\" mix of cars. This is a very puzzling statement, something that is a) been disproved by the incapacity of making BEV at positive margins b) against all we know about mass production with cost control - Toyota model. So the question is: why such statements? I am afraid this is a last ditch defense of their capital investment that is backing their access to the financial markets. Basically they are saying that the  value of their factories is unchanged and their loans are still solvable and they can keep on asking.\n\nI am not sure how many are keep on believing this, with GS, MS and DB, pretty much the 3 biggest financial institutions in the world, all showing skepticism. But Legacy ICE has been able to finance most of their operations using consumer leasing  of their own vehicles, and this is the biggest unknown: the used car market. Already there are sign of a crises in the \"toy cars\" leasing with basically all the buyers of toy cars (challengers, mustangs, charger, jeep etc.)  in the past 3 years having underwater loans - i.e. their car  after depreciation  is worth MORE than a brand new vehicle. If this translates to large scale leasing operations, and it is possible due to the recent economic downturn, the access to this form of capital will be severely undercut.\n\nA slowdown in the truck market in the US and the introduction of a 25 kEuros NEV car in Europe may spell the perfect storm", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "You lost me at two power systems will somehow be less expensive and less prone to failure than one EV only system.

I can't promise anything, but I have been following this company for several months now, and have built a good enough picture in my head to write it all out for you fellow degens. It's older than most of you, and it might just rock the boat in ways nobody is expecting. Curious? Dive in and let's explore this potential life-changing play together.\n\n[Did i mention they have a sick logo?](https://preview.redd.it/5l0c3jqp8kyb1.png?width=1474&format=png&auto=webp&s=4dd2e8cab8bc323222f48b58d22bdc812506d808)\n\nAlright lets dig in... why would anyone want to look at a company that is still known as the \"dead phone company\"? And why would this stock move in the coming months or anytime ever, its been trading sideways for years!? How crazy is this post? Well, before your brains start wandering, let me direct the attention back to $BB, and the potential play here.\n\n[Your average $BB retail investor, down at least 50&#37; and still holding.... poor guy, but that could all change...](https://preview.redd.it/31xdeyhkreyb1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6b36fcfe2422dc1e409aa325ebaf1b99db210021)\n\nOk enough memes(for now), lets get some things out of the way. What does blackberry currently do, if it doesn't make phones anymore? Well lets take a look at the past, and how $BB is where it is now(seemingly nowhere).\n\nYou see, $BB used to be a innovative company, they were one of the first companies to have email messaging portable, and would go on to make their infamous blackberry phones, complete with secure messaging(bbm), and all the apps you could need. It was $BB's golden era, and those phones sold like nothing they had ever imagined. But as we all know, Google and Apple emerged, and their ecosystems forced blackberries magical physical keyboards and immaculate hardware out of the picture. $BB was on the brink of collapse, and needed to do something quick to turn around the company before possible collapse and bankruptcy.\n\nEnter John Chen. The company needed a new CEO, someone who could save the company, and they found one. They picked John Chen because he's like a superhero for struggling tech companies. BlackBerry was in deep trouble, and he's the guy you call when you need a comeback. He's done this before you see, taking a company called Sybase from the brink of disaster to a success story(read [Sybase CEO John Chen: Tale of a Turnaround](https://www.computerworld.com/article/2758499/sybase-ceo-john-chen--tale-of-a-turnaround.html) for the scoop). Plus, BlackBerry wanted to focus on software, not just phones, and Chen knew how to make that happen. In short, he's their ace in the hole to save the day!\n\nAnd save the day he does, not only did John Chen prevent BlackBerry from bankruptcy, but he quickly began cooking up a strategy to be back on top of the game. First, he held onto the company's treasure chest of patents, like preserving rare collectibles. Then, he saw the diamond in the rough with QNX, BlackBerry's real-time operating system. He also snatched up Cylance, an AI-powered cybersecurity system, adding a potent weapon to the company's security arsenal. But he didn't stop there, and went on to secure several government contracts, becoming the trusted guardian of sensitive data. And with the introduction of BlackBerry IVY, their partnership with the tech giant Amazon, he made cars smarter, turning them into tech-savvy road warriors. JC's moves weren't just a rescue mission; they were the building blocks for BlackBerry's tech renaissance, taking it from the brink of obscurity to a tech player with a strong hand in the game.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/shrqrd3xafyb1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=281e6388e82036a91ba394f9fed243f9c0517ce6\n\nLets expand some of those things a bit real quick.\n\nStarting with the patents. Blackberry held a lot of nice ip after is phone business, and JC decided to preserve those patents and generate revenue by requiring companies who used this ip to pay fees and licensing. Not bad not bad, but thats small game JC, what else you got?\n\nWell JC has more tricks up his sleeve. Under his guidance, $BB acquired cylance, an artificial intelligence cybersecurity system designed to identify intrusions and irregularities using ai instead of the standard pattern based detection used back then. If you have heard of crowdstrike, or seen its success, cylance should ring a bell. However cylance did not grow as big as crowdstrike, and would go on to generate revenue throughout the years in the form of licensing fees and such.\n\nOkay, now this is where it gets interesting. JC had more in his bag of tricks. He continued to beef up the revenue by landing government contracts, like the United States Department of Homeland Security([united-states-department-of-homeland-security-awards-new-pens-contract-to-blackberry](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2023/united-states-department-of-homeland-security-awards-new-pens-contract-to-blackberry)) awarding a new contract to BlackBerry. Yes, you heard that right, securing our nation. Not too shabby for an under performing tech stock.\n\nBut JC had grander visions for BlackBerry. He transformed QNX, their real-time operating system, into the driving force behind a new era of automotive innovation. QNX was like the secret sauce, supercharging cars and turning them into intelligent, tech-savvy road warriors, primed to conquer any challenge on the asphalt battlefield. (more explained below, QNX and IVY get interesting fast)\n\nThat wasn't all, to add to icing on the cake, John Chen helped BlackBerry introduce IVY, a game-changing partnership with Amazon. IVY transforms your car into a smart, connected machine. It's like giving your car a brain that talks to the cloud, making your ride safer and more tech-savvy. (More explained below as well)\n\nTo summarize, John Chen did a lot to help turn around Blackberry and reposition it into a cyberecurity software and iot company ready to grow some profits. However, after doing all this, John Chen leaves the company... Thats right, after being at the helm for 10 years, John Chen retired this Friday and is no longer CEO of $BB... According to him, It is his time to go, and he has done what he set out to accomplish, he quotes in his letter to $BB employees([john-chen-retiring-letter-to-blackberry-employees](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2023/10/john-chen-retiring-letter-to-blackberry-employees)):\n\n>I joined BlackBerry with three key priorities. First, to ensure BlackBerry’s survival by repairing its financial health as the Company was just days away from potential bankruptcy at the time. Second, to establish a new strategy and line up the Company’s capabilities to deliver on that strategy. Third, to set the Company up for long-term growth. Now that each of these priorities has been achieved, the time seems right for me to leave.  \n>  \n>\\- John Chen\n\nFollowing this news, the stock seemed to jump a slight bit, as investors where quite relieved and happy to see John Chen go. Be as it may, John Chen seemed to have squandered $BB over the past decade, and did not provide investors with any share growth.\n\n[Not the CEO we needed, but the one we deserved.](https://preview.redd.it/xolgfbok2fyb1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f989e975a8f9269b4db17b85aad1c886632c653a)\n\nNow here is where the dd really starts to come into play, hopefully the reader has now grown a bit more familiar to $BB's history and is ready to finally move to the next stage in $BB's footsteps, understanding the value $BB can unlock. So lets dig a bit deeper shall we?\n\nIts worth mentioning the list above of products Blackberry now offers under John Chens former leadership is not an exhaustive list, and I have left some out simply because this isnt r/ValueInvesting and we are looking to squeeze $BB for all its got right? But for those of you interested, search UEM, or just go on the blackberry's product offerings page to view more things they have announced. In short, I do not see those of providing a lot of value but more of steady cash flow. See, John Chen is a smart guy, and he made sure blackberry has consistent cash flow. To achieve that he did all the above we listed. We will split up the boring products and the real gems here. Its simple: QNX and IVY are the only real gems that could skyrocket blackberries growth. Everything else is well, cyber security... You don't pay the IT department insane amounts of money to turn on Windows Defender do you? That being said, those cyber products are bringing in $BB a lot of value steadily and slowly, on top of building a lot of trust for the company. Did i mention they manage our government's security in some endpoints? Not bad at all. But lets get back to the real plays here, starting with QNX.\n\nWhat is QNX? Its a realtime operating system known for its reliability and security. It is designed for various embedded systems, including automotive systems, medical devices, industrial machinery, and more. Sounds like a lot of nothing to someone who may not know a lot about operating systems, and to the more tech savvy, well they will try to shove linux into anything nowadays, so QNX means nothing there either. QNX however, has immense value and practically no competition, providing blackberry a leading edge in many different fields. Let me explain, in the world of operating systems there are a lot of different design “specs” these computer systems are required to meet. Windows, Mac, Linux are the most heard of, and all three of these operate on what's known as a monolithic kernel. What this means is everything needed to run the operating system not including the userspace(programs, desktop environment, etc) is built and tightly coupled together. QNX on the other hand is a microkernel operating system, and is extremely lightweight. Only the core of the system(messaging bus, and hardware level networking is tightly integrated together), and the drivers and anything required to run on this system runs on userspace(decoupled from the system). If this still seems like a bunch of nonsense. please ask a cs friend or chatgpt to elaborate. But in short, qnx is so lightweight and simple that it allows for integrating into any embedded device with extremely fast response times between the kernel and its userpace tasks. Lets look at an example. The Tesla plaid model has 8 cameras positioned in various places, 12 sensors located on the front and back bumpers, and many more controlling the responsiveness of the vehicle, traction, and so forth. All of these separate devices need to communicate with the core of the car(insert qnx here) at microsecond speeds. This starting to click? Hopefully the reader can now start to see the value here, and spoiler, BB has already deployed QNX into many various fields and applications. Example(QNX is used in the spacex falcon rockets, among other things).\n\nUnfortunately, $BB has not released stats on how many of what certain fields run QNX, so we can only be certain of vehicles, but rest assured this is one of the most fascinating parts of this space anyways, as cars are here to stay and are mass produced every year. Currently $BB QNX is embedded in roughly 235M vehicles. And QNX is not hopium either, **Aptiv, BMW, Bosch, Ford, GM, Honda, Mercedes-Benz, Toyota, and Volkswagen** all trust and have already or will begin to integrate QNX into their vehicles and ev's in the coming years.\n\nQNX is great on its own, but there is one last piece of the puzzle we are missing here, IVY! Amazon and Blackberry began a 50/50 joint venture knows as IVY, where the goal is to create a uniform car system for everyone. The focus right now is on manufacturers, and before it becomes confusing, let’s look at an example: Imagine you are a vehicle manufacturer like Ford or Toyota. Now imagine you were able to keep track of every vehicle you sold on the road, out and about. IVY empowers you to be able to collect data from the qnx system, track in realtime your car fleets, and update firmware on them remotely without ever interrupting your user in an autonomous manner. Now add to the picture ev's, with their ever changing ecosystem. If you wanted to say, add artificial intelligent drive systems to compete with Tesla's, how would you go about this? Well you would use QNX and IVY to send all the vehicle drive data captures, sensor readings, and practically all valuable data to your servers to build a model to then make self driving magic!!! Its really that simple, and with IVY, the idea is to build a universal sdk that will work extremely well and be pleasant to build infotainment systems, etc. It’s still an evolving space, but if the reader considers electric vehicles to be a bigger part of the future, it’s safe to assume IVY will most likely be in almost all of those ev's. If this statement is considered ballsy, consider the fact that IVY is leading the competition in its space(there is really no other products designed to fulfill this goal) and again… all that has to be said is “Amazon has partnered with BB” and the momentum of that fact should hopefully by now set in. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p856m2ajcfyb1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=58471a89e8b608f80aed73b542f5b3d2dd4a86a0\n\nHowever, all of this IOT stuff is kewl and all, but again markets have not taken anything in BB's favor, and still under appreciate Blackberry for all the value its trying to push, leaving investors who have spotted this value and built significant bags stumped. Why is that?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/13xvdv3ucfyb1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0f7254f50d7070f666ad06740f92760cec9723ee\n\nWhile I can't exactly answer this question, investors haven't seen any share growth because Blackberry has been repositioning itself for the last 10 years and not really building a lot of wealth, leaving $BB's balance sheets at almost no cash left over practically ever, but after JC's help and retirement, adding to this several events slated to happen soon, it will become very clear to the reader that $BB will likely not stay at its current share price and is most certainly undervalued.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m8i3vp1ddfyb1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d78fb27f0f98ae86596d3191123298bdb5aa7d2a\n\nOk i mentioned at the start of this post that there are several things slated to happen soon that will directly affect its share price, so lets look into these and wrap up our dd :D\n\n1. The company currently has debentures expiring November 13(330 million dollars worth)which will make the company debt free.\n2. The company announced its decision to split the company into two parts(cyber & iot) sometime around june next year.\n3. With John Chen leaving there is now an interrim ceo who is currently a board member, so $BB will need to find a new ceo for both of its companies after the split. This could happen practically any time, or maybe it won't(explained below).\n\nWith those three key events, i think several things could happen:A. **Blackberries share price could jump to 6$ a share around November 8th-13th.**\n\n* This is because $BB debentures are going to be paid out to Fairfax Financial, whom has two options(convert debentures to 55M shares at 6$) or (Receive 330M in cash). While unlikely, Fairfax would be the biggest shareholder of Blackberry if those debentures were converted to shares(**17.28% percent of the companies stake**).  The reason i say this is unlikely is because blackberry is currently worth 3.70c, and if fairfax really wanted to keep buying shares, they could slowly flood the market with 330m dollars worth, purchasing at a lower price than the current market ask. However, they already own 7% of the company, and 55 million shares flooding the market at 6$ would likely increase the price to that strike, increasing fairfax's investment as a whole and doubling blackberries current share price. Fairfax's possible debenture conversion to shares would also show shareholders and investors waiting to buy shares that it considers blackberry a sound investment at 6$, providing a huge relief rally for $BB. On the flipside if Fairfax decides to take the cash blackberry would currently be left with a small amount of on hand cash and a very hesitant audience.\n\nB. **Blackberry share price could jump to 6-8$ a share(hopefully more) if the company gets bought out.**\n\n* This has been tossed around a lot, but with John Chen's leave, the debentures expiring, and a very small and old board of directors, it is still within the realm of possibilities that A scenario doubling blackberries price could show possible suitors blackberries worth and open the door to a buyout. This is a highly disputed scenario, and something nobody can \"predict\" accurately, but keep in mind this could possibly be priced in November at the least. What i would like to ask the reader is to put yourself in the BOD's shoes. They are all aged 60's-70's. If you were offered a significant buyout at that age, would you take the money and retire? I would imagine this would be a unanimous vote, and key thing to take note here: John Chen did not want a buyout... So while its near impossible to know why the board deemed it a good idea to let John Chen leave amidst so many changes in the company, it may very well be to open the door to a possible buyout.\n\nC. **Blackberry's share price could jump around June with the whole stock split.**\n\n* Blackberry decided to split the company in two next June to show investors value in the IOT space, and while we don't have much news about this yet, an IPO is usually a great way to bring in a lot of interest to a company and watchful eyes.\n\nD. **Blackberry keeps trading like nothing ever happened, and in 10 years $BB investors realize profits.**\n\n* It could very well happen, but at this current price, its almost free pizza :D\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/264owo7qjfyb1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bcc256b2ccbe854619c7124a1994eb2711f70a9c\n\nAnyways, I hope the reader has enjoyed this meticulous post, and if one finds any grammatical or factually incorrect errors, please let me know below and i will update the post accordingly. I would like to preface, I am simply a growing investor, I do not hold any insider information, I just like the stock. So for me, it’s a simple strategy, to keep purchasing shares and leaps.
