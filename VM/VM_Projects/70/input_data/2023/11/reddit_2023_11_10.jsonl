Several of my friends were violent in the 1999 WTO riots, and one even got I think a $10,000 payout for that from the city. I think the city paid the Battle of Seattle people that were arrested over a quarter of a million dollars. Their violence really succeeded in pushing the rioter's anti-globalization message.
