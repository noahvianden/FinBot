If you think about it, between the stocks themselves, the SPY/SPX/VOO, QQQs, futures, options, levered ETFs like TQQQ, etc. and how many Americans have huge allocations to them via 401ks, if there were a reversal and those went into a major bear market it could have disastrous effects on the economy for a long time.\n\nI also agree with someone else who said that these look an awful lot like blowoff tops in a lot of them and msft and aapl have been going up for years and years so if they did crash it would definitely reflect the buildup to prior crashes like the dot com bubble or 1929/87. Of course you can never know that until after the fact.\n\nAnother concerning factor is that lots of people now believe stocks will go up forever, very similarly to 1929 actually. That‚Äôs not an exaggeration- if you go on Twitter you will see lots of people post the chart that shows stocks rising for the past 125 years and all of the negative headlines that occurred along the way.
