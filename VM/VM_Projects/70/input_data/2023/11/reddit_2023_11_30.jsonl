Bert Colijn, senior euro zone economist at ING, said in a Wednesday note that “sluggish demand” should keep inflation on track toward 2%.\n\nInflation in the euro zone’s largest economies, Germany and France, has dropped to 2.3% and 3.8%, respectively.\n\nMathieu Savary, chief European strategist at BCA Research, said that traders would now be tempted to bring forward expectations for the timeline of the first ECB rate cut, but argued that the central bank’s concerns over labor market tightness continued to imply “later rather than sooner rate cuts.”\n\nSeparate data released by statistics agency Eurostat on Thursday showed that unemployment in the euro area remained at a record low of 6.5% in October, despite a contraction in the euro zone economy in the third quarter.", "id": "187ft7n", "created_utc": 1701341434.0, "score": 318, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 84, "comments": [{"body": "Hi, you're on r/Stocks, please make sure your post is related to stocks or the stockmarket or it will most likely get removed as being off-topic/political; feel free to edit it now and be more specific.\n\n**To everyone commenting:**  Please focus on how this affects the stock market or specific stocks or it will be removed as being off-topic/political.\n\nIf you're interested in just politics, see our wiki on [\"relevant subreddits\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index) and post to those Reddit communities instead without linking back here, thanks!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
