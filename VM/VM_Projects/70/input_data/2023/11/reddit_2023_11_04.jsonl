Their efforts go beyond activities strictly related to Berkshire: Last year, for example, they dealt with the 40 universities (selected from 200 applicants) who sent students to Omaha for a Q&A day with me. They also handle all kinds of requests that I receive, arrange my travel, and even get me hamburgers and french fries (smothered in Heinz ketchup, of course) for lunch.

He told me the solar you typically see on homes only works if it is tied to the grid since it needs to match phasing.

Oil and gas has dominated the economy for their entire lives, and they don’t see the value in anything else. Plus they believe anything Fox News tells them, and if Fox says getting rid of oil and gas will kill the blue collar economy, they believe it. As a for instance, my dad is a crane operator who is certified in every type of crane up to and including the huge ones used to build skyscrapers. For the past 15 years he has chosen to work in the oil and gas industry and so the idea of sustainable/renewable energy picking up has him scared to death he’ll lose his job. Cranes are used for every manner of infrastructure building, so he’ll be more than fine, but Fox News says he’ll lose his job if green energy starts to dominate, so he’s very against green energy. I works as a financial advisor and a lot of people I talk to are boomers and hard core republicans, and they refuse to invest in anything with renewable energy because “that’s all hog wash and hurts the environment more than oil. That’s just the liberal agenda to kill the hard working middle class.”", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I doubt oil and gas would completely go away, but there would certainly be a reduction. As people get older, there is more and more of the \"if it aint broke, why fix it\" mentality. Remember the uproar switching from incandescent to LED light bulbs. You'd also be hard pressed to find a tube tv nowadays. Once the cost of the new tech is comparable to what it will replace then it doesn't take long for the old to get phased out.\n\nNews Media is an issue in itself. Both sides create sensational stories and leave out information to remain relevant to their viewers so they can keep getting ad money. I'd say I'm a moderate if there were a label leaning more republican. My problem with green energy is the policies and not the tech itself. There seems to be a notion that we can just flip and be all electric in a generation. But there isn't an established \"gas station\" infrastructure and that's why you see backlash. People feel like their choice is being taken away and replaced with an unfamiliar alternative that they only focus on the negatives to justify not advancing. My coworker likes to bitch about electric vehicles any time Biden talks about them (he drives an 06 charger to compensate). What if the power goes out? What if you want to go on long trips? Cars are more expensive than gas. What if you go empty on the road?, a tow truck can't bring you a tank of electricity. Electric cars make no sound so blind people might step out in front of them. I'd refute all of his complaints with simple solutions, but he'd go on bitching anyways.\n\nI really thought hybrid vehicles would have taken off sooner with the prius before going all electric, but i am seeing more ads pushing hybrids so it's only a matter of time for combustion only to phase out. A few decades for infrastructure to be built and all electric tech to improve then the hybrids will phase out. Unless Energizer or Duracell develops the Harbulary battery, we'll still have gasoline for a while.\n\nI had an idea once for where the All Electric Vehicles market should go. The battery with standardized terminals would be swapable at a station just like the co-op 5 gallon propane tanks found in front of stores. The dead battery is shipped off to be recharged and inspected. Bad batteries go to recycling. Existing gas stations can be converted. Tow trucks can bring you a fresh charge if your stupid enough to drive pass a station. There could even be delivery service business that will drive around to swap out your battery just like the milk man of the old days. The grid wouldn't be as taxed with all the vehicles on chargers. The grid wouldn't need to be overhauled to handle all the chargers. People would have the convenience of being back on the road in less than 5 minutes (which is probably the biggest complaint).
