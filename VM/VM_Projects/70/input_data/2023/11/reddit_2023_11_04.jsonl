All this money has been pumped into green energy generation to replace coal and natural gas fired plants, but there hasn't really been much in the way of storage, especially in residential backups. Being in the Midwest (USA) sometimes in the summer we get storms, or in the winter ice that knocks out power for a few hours or even days. I can deal with the house being cold, but we have livestock and if the power is out then water pipes and tanks freeze over. I work in the construction industry and i had asked one of our electric contractors about solar for my farm as a backup.  He told me the solar you typically see on homes only works if it is tied to the grid since it needs to match phasing. Lithium Home battery systems tend to double the cost of the solar and need to be replaced because of the dendrite fire issue. There just isn't anything affordable that can match a propane generator. I'd looked into alternatives to lithium and while watching YouTube what's new tech videos, what i found promising is Iron flow battery tech. It's not as compact as lithium, but manufacturing and material costs are lower which is more attractive for integration in commercial buildings. There is no fire risk so small versions could be installed in garages or basements of any apartment building or residential home to compliment the solar on the roof or micro wind turbines. I've invested in ESS (GWH) since it's been around for a decade and has a proven product It just seems like all that it needs is to get its name out in front of Tesla as a chapter alternative for grid scale storage. From there it's just manufacturing scaling. There was a statement in an article on their website and I'm not quoting it exactly but it was in response to the size comparison to lithium batteries; \"Sure it's bigger than lithium, but compare that to how much land a wind farm takes up.

Oil and gas has dominated the economy for their entire lives, and they don‚Äôt see the value in anything else. Plus they believe anything Fox News tells them, and if Fox says getting rid of oil and gas will kill the blue collar economy, they believe it. As a for instance, my dad is a crane operator who is certified in every type of crane up to and including the huge ones used to build skyscrapers. For the past 15 years he has chosen to work in the oil and gas industry and so the idea of sustainable/renewable energy picking up has him scared to death he‚Äôll lose his job. Cranes are used for every manner of infrastructure building, so he‚Äôll be more than fine, but Fox News says he‚Äôll lose his job if green energy starts to dominate, so he‚Äôs very against green energy. I works as a financial advisor and a lot of people I talk to are boomers and hard core republicans, and they refuse to invest in anything with renewable energy because ‚Äúthat‚Äôs all hog wash and hurts the environment more than oil. That‚Äôs just the liberal agenda to kill the hard working middle class.‚Äù", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I doubt oil and gas would completely go away, but there would certainly be a reduction. As people get older, there is more and more of the \"if it aint broke, why fix it\" mentality. Remember the uproar switching from incandescent to LED light bulbs. You'd also be hard pressed to find a tube tv nowadays. Once the cost of the new tech is comparable to what it will replace then it doesn't take long for the old to get phased out.\n\nNews Media is an issue in itself. Both sides create sensational stories and leave out information to remain relevant to their viewers so they can keep getting ad money. I'd say I'm a moderate if there were a label leaning more republican. My problem with green energy is the policies and not the tech itself. There seems to be a notion that we can just flip and be all electric in a generation. But there isn't an established \"gas station\" infrastructure and that's why you see backlash. People feel like their choice is being taken away and replaced with an unfamiliar alternative that they only focus on the negatives to justify not advancing. My coworker likes to bitch about electric vehicles any time Biden talks about them (he drives an 06 charger to compensate). What if the power goes out? What if you want to go on long trips? Cars are more expensive than gas. What if you go empty on the road?, a tow truck can't bring you a tank of electricity. Electric cars make no sound so blind people might step out in front of them. I'd refute all of his complaints with simple solutions, but he'd go on bitching anyways.\n\nI really thought hybrid vehicles would have taken off sooner with the prius before going all electric, but i am seeing more ads pushing hybrids so it's only a matter of time for combustion only to phase out. A few decades for infrastructure to be built and all electric tech to improve then the hybrids will phase out. Unless Energizer or Duracell develops the Harbulary battery, we'll still have gasoline for a while.\n\nI had an idea once for where the All Electric Vehicles market should go. The battery with standardized terminals would be swapable at a station just like the co-op 5 gallon propane tanks found in front of stores. The dead battery is shipped off to be recharged and inspected. Bad batteries go to recycling. Existing gas stations can be converted. Tow trucks can bring you a fresh charge if your stupid enough to drive pass a station. There could even be delivery service business that will drive around to swap out your battery just like the milk man of the old days. The grid wouldn't be as taxed with all the vehicles on chargers. The grid wouldn't need to be overhauled to handle all the chargers. People would have the convenience of being back on the road in less than 5 minutes (which is probably the biggest complaint).
