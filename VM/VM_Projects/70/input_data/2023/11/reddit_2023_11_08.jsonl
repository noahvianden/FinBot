{"title": "Disney up almost 5% aftermarket after showing Disney+ growth and 7% revenue growth Y.o.Y", "selftext": "**Bullish Highlights:**\n\n\\- Revenue Growth: Q4 revenues increased by 5%, with a 7% rise year-over-year (YOY).\n\n\\- Earnings Per Share (EPS): Q4 EPS from continuing operations rose to $0.14 from $0.09 YOY.\n\n\\- Adjusted EPS: When excluding certain items, Q4 EPS jumped to $0.82 from $0.30, and annual EPS increased to $3.76 from $3.53.\n\n\\- Subscriber Growth: Disney+ added a strong 7 million subscribers in Q4.\n\n\\- Parks and Experiences: Operating income soared over 30% YOY, with growth across all segments.\n\n\\- Cost Efficiency: The company has raised its annualized efficiency target to $7.5 billion, up from $5.5 billion.\n\n\\- Free Cash Flow: There's an expectation of significant growth in FY24, with targets set to reach pre-pandemic levels.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Bearish Considerations:**\n\n\\- Annual EPS Decline: Despite a strong quarter, annual EPS fell to $1.29 from $1.75.\n\n\\- Wage Inflation: The company is managing against wage inflation and challenging comparisons to the previous year's 50th-anniversary celebrations at Walt Disney World.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Forward Outlook:**\n\n\\- Disney anticipates its streaming services to achieve profitability by Q4 of FY24, though they caution that progress may be uneven quarter to quarter.\n\n\\- The company is bullish on ESPN's growth and its evolution into a leading digital sports platform.\n\n\\- There's a focus on improving the economics of film studios and turbocharging growth in the parks and experiences sector.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**CEO's Perspective:**\n\nRobert A. Iger, CEO, expressed optimism about the company's trajectory. He emphasized the foundational work done over the past year, which positions Disney to move from a period of restructuring to a phase of growth. Iger outlined four key areas for future success: streaming profitability, ESPN's digital transformation, film studio output, and parks and experiences growth. He's bullish on the opportunities ahead and is focused on creating lasting growth and increasing shareholder value.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT:  \n**Earnings Call Just in:**  \n\\- Board recommends instating dividend at the end of the year. Not specified how much as of yet.\n\n  \n\\- Pricing for Disney+ are expected to go up as they look towards growing the digital streaming business. They mention bundeling Hulu, Disney+ and ESPN. They also want to counter account sharing, similar to what Netflix did.\n\n  \n\\- When competing with Netflix, Disney believes their IP and its quality gives them the ability to dial down expenses on marketing and 'series expenses', improving their margins compared to competitors\n\n  \n\\- Disney plans to lean more into ESPN, stating it is the 'most popular brand on TikTok'. They are quite bullish about it.\n\n  \n\\- FCF growth improvement is dedicated to decreased content spend. Whether or not they can keep up this trend is anyone's guess.\n\n  \n\\- Disney does not want to license their core IP to Netflix. Even if licensing would provide some 'quick bucks', they think it undermines their value proposition and long term strategy for Disney+\n\n  \n\\- Outlook on parks and cruises: Disney expects the performance of the parks and its cruises, both domestically and internationally, to keep growing. They mention not seeing any impact on the numbers from tougher economic conditions.  \nThat's it! Thanks!
