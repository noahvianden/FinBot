I worked for a government entity where the maintenance staff was represented by a union that was 100% in bed with management and sold us out over and over in negotiations, telling us \"there just isn't the money\". For disciplinary actions, the unions reps just didn't show up. Attempts to change the leadership always ended up with a weird sort of \"chinese fire drill\" situation where union leadership shuffled around, but somehow nobody from our particular area ended up having any say in negotiations. Eventually enough of us got pissed and we brought in the Teamsters union to organize us. Somehow, mysteriously, once the Teamsters were running it we had a voice in negotiations and management miraculously found the money, and all the abusive disciplinary actions stopped the first time a Teamsters rep showed up for a discipline meeting and told them the Fucking Around was over, and they were now in the Find Out stage.\n\nI worked most of my adult life represented by unions, and while most of them were functioning as intended and a great form of worker protection, there are definitely some unions out there that have \"favorite\" and \"not favorite\" workers, and will throw one side under the bus if they can get favorable treatment for the other.
