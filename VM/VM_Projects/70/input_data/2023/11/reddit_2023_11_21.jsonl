{"title": "NVDA NVDA NVDA Earnings TODAY!", "selftext": "Guys, it's finally time. NVIDIA's earnings report is today - after hours. I'm sitting here waiting on what they have to say regarding their new AI developments. Despite the recent shakeups in AI leadership and the U.S. government's tightened chip export rules, NVIDIA seems unfazed, hitting a new all time high.\n\nThe hot topic for NVIDIA's management this earnings call will be their strategies to overcome supply constraints and cater to the soaring demand. The analysts are fixed on an expected revenue of $16.2 billion for the October quarter, with adjusted EPS hitting $3.37. The anticipation ramps up for the current quarter, with revenue estimates at a whopping $18.0 billion.\n\nNVIDIA's shares have been on a bullish ride, up 2.3% at $504.20 on Monday. This surge aligns with Piper Sandler analyst Harsh Kumar's optimistic stance, who reaffirms a **$620 price target** on NVIDIA shares, spotlighting the robust demand from U.S. cloud and data center clients. The key challenge, according to Kumar, is the supply of GPUs, which are literally the lifeblood of NVIDIA's dominance in the AI chip market.\n\nTheir GPUs, crucial for parallel computations needed in AI model training, are at the forefront of the AI revolution. The high-end H100, launched earlier this year, quickly turned into a sought-after resource, thanks to the burgeoning interest in generative AI. The announcement of the H200 Tensor Core GPU, expected in Q2 2024, is already stirring talks of a new wave of demand.\n\nNVIDIA's pace in releasing chips is also noteworthy. Moving from a two-year to a one-year product cycle for AI chips, NVIDIA is set to unleash more high-end AI products in 2024 and 2025. This strategy could be a game-changer in maintaining their market dominance.\n\nIn the backdrop of NVIDIA's stock hitting a record high of $504.09 per share, the upcoming earnings report is more than just numbers. It's a snapshot of NVIDIA's stronghold in the 2023 AI narrative. Here's a quick look at what Wall Street expects versus last year's performance:\n\n- Revenue: $16.1 billion expected, a significant leap from $5.93 billion in Q3 last year.\n- Adjusted EPS: $3.36 expected, up from $0.58 in Q3 last year.\n- Data center revenue: $12.82 billion expected, a major jump from $3.83 billion in Q3 last year.\n- Gaming revenue: Expected to hit $2.7 billion, up from $1.57 billion.\n\nAmidst these projections, the fourth quarter revenue guidance is critical, with expectations set at $17.8 billion. NVIDIA has been shattering expectations, and Wall Street is eager to see if this trend continues.\n\nHowever, not all is smooth sailing. The stock experienced a hiccup post-August report as valuation concerns and China's chip restrictions posed challenges. NVIDIA's SEC filing indicates minimal near-term impact from these restrictions, and analysts like Stifel's Ruben Roy expect similar reassurances in the earnings call.\n\nNVIDIA's role as a market momentum driver is undeniable. As a member of the \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks, including Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, and Tesla, NVIDIA has helped propel the collective gains of these giants by over 70% this year.\n\nEvercore ISI's Julian Emanuel's advice to investors: brace for \"post-NVDA volatility,\" as the stock's performance post-earnings could set the tone for the market. In essence, it's NVIDIA's world, and we're just trading in it.\n\nSo there you have it, guys. It's not just them playing the AI game, they're literally in control of it. Due to the high strike price, NVDA calls are a little too expensive for an \"earning\" play. So I'm gonna suggest a call spread. Let's just *assume* it goes up 5%. What type of call spread would we need for max profit? I'd grab a NVDA 11/24 500c for 1830 and sell the 525c for 905. This basically means you can grab the spread for $925. If it were to go up 5%, that means potentially 170% profit. \n\nWith previous earnings, it's moved way more than 5% on average, so this should be an okay bet. Although still expensive. Keep in mind, like my other posts: this isn't financial advice. I'd like to just show people the type of stuff we tend to look at when trying to attempt an earning play. This hopefully will help you with future earning plays too.", "id": "180pijx", "created_utc": 1700595819.0, "score": 28, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "num_comments": 87, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|10|**First Seen In WSB**|3 months ago\n**Total Comments**|148|**Previous Best DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/17kq09i/amd_earnings_time_to_hit_it_big/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/17mbilh/sq_earnings_alert_everything_you_need_to_know/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/17zyl2x/zm_earnings_today_whats_in_the_cards/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/17h0sy7/amazon_earnings_the_boomer_play_that_could_print/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/166ir9a/everything_you_need_to_know_about_lulu_earnings/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/15lm14d/grabbing_calls_for_rivn_earnings/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/17lj3m9/abnb_earnings_alert_everything_you_need_to_know/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/16svsgy/cost_to_the_moon_yolo_time_as_earnings_drop_today/) \n**Account Age**|3 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n>TL;DR: 1.
