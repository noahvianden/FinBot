Things were much different in the 1970s than today in terms of giant corporate tech companies looking to absorb start ups with promising revolutionary technology. There wasn't anything as massive and all-encompassing in the '70s as Apple, Amazon, etc.\n\nTherefore, I stand by my assertion that I think it's unlikely that there's an Apple-level investment opportunity that you could get in on the ground floor of today. If you think otherwise I think you're underestimating just how big Apple is and how it essentially helped start up an entire new industry and sector PLUS made multiple revolutionary inventions, including some decades after their IPO. \n\nI think you'd also be underestimating the chances that an Apple-like company today would get bought out by one of the current big companies, whereas Apple and other big tech companies have had the opportunity to grow without being absorbed by a larger entity.\n\nI think you and others pointing out oil companies being so big are onto something though. While everyone is thinking the next big revolutionary invention will be AI or tech-related, I think there's a good possibility that it will be energy-related the same way these oil companies have been able to balloon up.\n\nOf course, I think the next revolutionary energy will likely be tech-related (as in EVs/electronic energy or something that doesn't use fossil fuels).

Or maybe it will IPO years from now. Or maybe it will get bought out by one of these bigger companies long before it has a chance to become a $3 trillion company. I think that last one is most likely, and that's mainly what I'm trying to say.\n\nI think my point was misunderstood or maybe I could have worded it better. I'm not saying you'll never see another company grow to the size that Apple is currently. I'm saying that I'm doubtful there's a company you could buy at IPO within the next few years that will eventually become as big as Apple is now.\n\nIt definitely could happen, but the odds are not that good. AI or whatever big breakthrough will likely be dominated by companies like Apple, Tesla, Boston Dynamics, OpenAI, or whoever, even if they have to buy out a smaller startup that makes the big breakthroughs.\n\nEven if there is some hot startup that revolutionizes things, it's incredibly likely that one of the bigger companies today would buy it out long before it became a $3 trillion company.\n\nI think people underestimate how big these tech companies have gotten and how much the landscape has changed since the 1970s.

I was still able to call out some great levels over the week while waiting in some lines but nothing better than being back in the office and making some nice gains. \n\nGoing to have a slightly longer post here to catch up on some things that happened while I was gone… \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/506xd8m18xta1.png?width=970&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a5cafe06f8727617908af075fd2525dba6a2459\n\nThe first obviously would be CPI… CPI YoY came in bullishly as expected (very few expected anything other than that)…. But what was the true story? The true story was CORE YoY which came in at 5.6% which was 0.1% hotter than previous CORE YoY. \n\nHere is why CORE is important: By stripping out the volatile components of the CPI, core inflation allows us to see the broad underlying trend in consumer prices. Core inflation is often used as an indicator of the long‐term inflation trend as well as future inflation.\n\nNow take a look at the trend on CPI YoY and CORE YoY for the last year. CPI YoY has been falling since June 2022 consistently… and actually took a 1% drop from month to month which is the largest decrease in YoY CPI since November to December which dropped 0.6%... However, take a look at CORE YoY… CORE has only been falling since September consistently. With this increase from 5.5 to 5.6% on YoY CORE we actually saw our first INCREASE in CORE YoY since September 2022. Now I actually am surprised markets have not reacted more to it than they did already… \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/70lj5h228xta1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d0e7fefb9ab80217482d7cbba4993b08df864ce\n\nNow not surprisingly we went from about a 50/50 chance of a pause to 79.5% chance of a 25bps…. Honestly that’s not really the main story to be talking about here… Lets talk about June 14th FOMC… why does June FOMC matter so much? Well currently there are 6 total FOMC meetings scheduled by the EOY… With 25bps expected at May 3rd… that means there are 5 meetings left… \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0y479gl28xta1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=64595022748f22df87ea5af751ff984330d0a388\n\nNow according to the Atlanta Fed probability tracker by EOY we are expecting to be in a 425 to 450 target range…. Which means when we get our 25bps hike in May that will put the fed funds rate at 500-525…. That means currently market has about 100bps of cuts priced in by EOY…\n\nThis assumes the following schedule…\n\nMay 3rd= 25bps (500-525)  \n June 14th= Pause  \n July 26th= No bps/ hold   \n Sept 20th= (475-500  \n October 1st= (450-475)  \n December 13th= (425-450)\n\nNow lets look at inflation… IF inflation is about to rebound and when we look at the fact that over the last oil futures are up 30% over the last month… there is a REALLY good chance that CPI is going to rebound. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4l2ltx538xta1.png?width=806&format=png&auto=webp&s=9541a593859996ab32df8600bbb732d913500309\n\nIf we get a rebound on CPI there is no way that JPOW would pause… and not only that but or those of you who forgot (and I think markets were kindly reminded Wednesday with FOMC minutes) JPOW mic dropped the markets and said that there was NO base case for rate hikes… one of the only reasons they even considered a pause and didn’t do 50bps was because of the bank run and they were afraid of breaking the market… \n\nNow JPOW himself and fed officially all agree as of last FOMC (which not much has changed since) that there is NO case for rate CUTS by EOY… Yet the market has priced in about 100BPS of cuts by EOY…\n\nVery quickly here we are going to find out who is right and who is wrong… May FOMC very well may give us some insight into what JPOW is feeling… \n\nWe are scheduled to have a CPI reading on May 10th and June 13th which means between the next two FOMCs we will get two more readings… IF any of these readings show that rebound in inflation then the markets are going to have no choice but to realize they priced this all wrong…\n\nJPOW has to confirm this as the last rate hike (May) or we are likely to see the markets get broken over the summer when they realize the fed funds rate projection is 1000% incorrect and that we are not pausing like they decided (even though JPOW said we weren’t going to…). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m3yem2m38xta1.png?width=897&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d130499228f66e6b6436704158ffa8610212cc3\n\nLooking at the calendar for next week we have really nothing notable to keep an eye on besides jobless claims Thursday (haven’t moved markets much), Friday is PMI and then a few fed speakers sprinkled throughout. \n\nThis probably explains why Monday DTE SPX IV is currently sitting in the 8% range… I don’t know the last time I have seen IV that low over the weekend. \n\n**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mad0hy248xta1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=70a0855c50622eb7d67147238572f7d71bd7dc0c\n\nThis week did add a few new levels but surprisingly we have not taken out any old levels yet… very interesting that there is so much price action happening here in this 409 to 414 area. \n\nLooking at Daily here we today established a new demand (support) at 409.19 which should provide some upside potential. We actually have officially broken extreme bull momentum this week so we no longer have as strong of an upside case. \n\n414.13 and 415.36 supplies (resistance) have provided some hefty resistance the last two days and I would look for those levels to continue to reject us. A few things to note about SPY Daily is that volatility is picking up (which can signal an end of a trend (which currently is bull), price action on Wednesday actually signaled a bearish reversal and we lose extreme bull momentum. The only thing really left is for the IV increase on the daily time frame which would be the final confirmation of a bearish reversal pattern. \n\n**SPY WEEKLY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qo9iqbq48xta1.png?width=972&format=png&auto=webp&s=4357e19bbfdd13c3173bf7f5e6353a585bcd6ec3\n\nNow the last 2 weeks (going into this week) we had see that 410 weekly supply (resistance) hold extremely well, however, we finally did poke over that and close over it this week. With that weekly closure over supply one COULD assume a run to 427.53 supply (resistance) is coming. \n\nHowever, the weekly timeframe is still attempting to establish a new supply which now would be a supply over 410 (resistance). \n\nI see two weekly possibility heres… first is that we turn this weekly candle into supply which means 412.63 becomes a new supply. This would allow for a retrace back under 410 to take out that supply. From there with SPY weekly NOT in extreme bull momentum we would look to 385.9 demand (support) or a new demand being established to potentially bounce us. \n\nOur second possibility here would be that we continue to push higher and higher and target 427.53 supply that was established back in August of 2022. \n\n**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7n5f76a58xta1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=74968ea5c84da5acf161bd7aee71b9e30040df16\n\nOn a daily time frame here we have a really beautiful cup and handle still attempting to play out. That upside of the cup could be the 415.1 rejection. If that is indeed the upside of the cup with a 9% low to high rise we would start to look for a 33.33% retrace to form the handle which will result in about a 3% retrace which then gives a possible downside target of 402.6. There is a potential scenario where we do run to 417.03 to form the cup which would give 405.2 as our retrace target. \n\nWe still have our 3 gaps in the 396.5 to 404.55 range that needs to be filled also. \n\nWe continue to bounce off the daily 8ema and continue to rise in this red bull channel. Currently support sits at 411 for Monday for that bull channel. Which means if we break under 411 then we will break this nearly month long support and should start to look for a sell off. \n\nOne other thing to keep an eye on here is that 406.6 to 413.6 continues to be a consolidation area also and we have held that range (at close) for 10 straight trading days. Breaking out of one of these areas is likely to be a signal of direction to come. \n\n**SPY WEEKLY PRICE ACTION**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g8ew72w58xta1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=3bf3b813b355bcc9171b8a127d06dbd856cd4447\n\nThe weekly chart here is actually a bit more intriguing as there isn’t a good sold answer of what way we are going to go… \n\nFrom a bullish stand point we continue to hold the weekly 8ema support and continued to put in a higher high and broke the breakout triangle that dates back over a year now. With that we should fully start looking for a run to 427.25 supply (resistance) that was established back in August. \n\nHowever, from a bearish stand point we perfectly double topped at 412.5 resistance that was established back in January 2023. With the long side of the wick to the upside here that could signal a likely top which would bring SPY back down next week. In addition we broke the month long red bull channel support. \n\nBears will look to keep 412.5 as resistance and will look to close back under key 407.3 weekly channel support. However, bulls will look to break through 412.5 resistance and target 417 and 422. We actually have a small weekly gap DOWN from 421.22 to 419.96 from August. \n\nIf you remember dating back a year now SPY has at max spent 4 weeks CLOSED over 407.7 and on average only CLOSES 3 weekly candles over 407.3 before it retraces back below. This week marks week 3 of closures over 407.7… \n\nSPY Weekly Levels  \n Supply- 410 -> 427.5  \n Demand- 385.9  \n Support- 407.3 -> 404  \n Resistance- 412.5 -> 417\n\n**FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMNAD**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k9nxkrk68xta1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=38f69b0aa257cefe83c0091f3947ef108aaccb38\n\nFutures daily here is trying to close out a doji double top here at 4170. Futures has actually bounced off of the daily 8ema 5 out of the last 7 trading days. Futures made a new demand (support) on 4-12 at 4116 which provides the current upside push. \n\nWith Futures no longer being in extreme bull momentum and much like SPY nearing bearish reversal conditions we should continue to look for this to be the top. We are currently trending between 4160 and 4198 supplies. IF and when we establish a new supply our downside targets will remain 4160 -> 4153 and then 4116. \n\nIf bears can take us under 4116 there are still 3 major levels that need to be taken out down at 4055, 4040, and 4015 before Futes can not only push higher but sustain a higher push. \n\n**FUTURES WEEKLY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zfd3wt278xta1.png?width=730&format=png&auto=webp&s=b6587159e6bf8085c35f0233affe5452fb1f0576\n\nFutures weekly here shows much of the same as SPY… Showing that we barely today (despite trading under it most of the day) closed over 4149 weekly supply (resistance) and our next upside target remains 4284 is bulls can continue to push us up. However, If we are to turn 4170 into a new weekly supply our downside targets would be 4149 and then 4055.\n\nBulls still need to go back down and take out weekly supply at 4149 and 4055 before we can realistically push higher in a balanced manner. \n\n**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yuay69i78xta1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=9898a37d2b0383603e1e5b867bbcad2f387c75e1\n\nYou can see the really nice daily double top with the doji here at 4172 on Futures. This is where price action is more or less without trend as we saw much of today an aggressive sell off only to once again by EOD recover. The daily 8ema still remains key support and for the last 2 weeks was an opportunity to buy calls at every touch. \n\n**FUTURES WEEKLY PRICE ACTION**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9gm6mt288xta1.png?width=711&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb1e9eada83fd415a0f4bfe5783c5323b5c81081\n\nFrom a very similar stand point here we see that futures broke through the black breakout triangle resistance however it also broke through the 4 week long bull channel support. There we a nice back test of 4095 area that did hold on futures… with a closure over 4149 (unlike spy that double topped here) the upside potential on futures remains a run to 4220. \n\nFutures Weekly Levels  \n Supply- 4149 -> 4284  \n Demand- 3919  \n Support- 4135 -> 4095  \n Resistance- 4172 -> 4220\n\n**VIX**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9atpzvi88xta1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c9b7e31ac6e4c62f3a68909bbe226331f8c78fd\n\nNow this is where things get a bit interesting… the VIX closed 1 penny higher than the 52 week low of 17.06. \n\nSomething that is interesting about the VIX and anytime it touches the 17s is that usually is the local top on SPY… lets take a look at the times it has hit <$18 and what SPY did afterwards. \n\nFeb 2nd VIX hit a low of 17.06 (current 52 week low)… SPY the next day dumped -1.06% and that led to the current -9% 26 day drop before a bottom was put in at 380.65.\n\nJanuary 12th the VIX hit a low of 17.36 and the next day SPY dumped -1.38% and this led to a -11% 12 day sell off. \n\nJanuary 4th the VIX bottomed at 16.34 which led to a -1.92% drop the next day and led to a -5% and 6 day sell off…\n\nOn Average the last 3 times the VIX was this low the next day SPY dropped -1.45% and over an average of 14.6 days dropped a total of -8.33%... This would give SPY a target of 380.6 by may 1st… which is almost exactly the next FOMC meeting and almost exactly the low we put in during the march sell off. \n\n**10YR YIELD AND DXY**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fkn4dtva8xta1.png?width=1071&format=png&auto=webp&s=aaf0ce78eba9f2e0af8f4238b5524b49c3cfae6e\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fazgo1pc8xta1.png?width=1063&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f12f2d4737e47eb4b4c425bd4934dde96c62a3a\n\nNow this is something else that interestingly enough on DXY and the 10YR yield that also goes perfectly with the VIX 17.07 bounce (aka calling the bottom of VIX and Top of SPY) and goes with the possible cup and handle being formed on SPY/ futures daily. \n\nWhen we look at the last time the officially top of SPY was put in it was on February 2nd and the DXY put in a support level at 100.86 at that time. Yesterday and today the DXY bounced off these level and formed a really nice double bottom off of 100.99. \n\nAlso taking a look at the 10YR yield generally speaking we see the rates of the 10YR rise while SPY drops… with a local bottom potentially being put in at 3.306% support last week… if the 10YR is able to push through 3.518% then our target would be 3.617% to 3.704% on the 10YR…. The last time the 10YR traded at 3.518% SPY was at 408.44 to 411.37. The last time it traded 3.617 to 3.704% SPY was trading at 380.65 to 393.45… \n\nWhile I know many people are pretty bullish right now… there are a lot of stars aligning that could provide a drop as low as 380… but more realistically I think a retest of 390 leading into the next FOMC meeting is entirely possible. \n\n**EARNINGS**\n\nOne other thing to keep in mind is that over the next month we are starting to come into Earnings season with banks kicking us off today already. \n\nNext week we can look forward to more banks on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. \n\nWednesday we have Tesla. \n\nThursday starts us off with TSM, more banks, and some retail starting to trickle in.\n\nThe big week for earnings will be the Week of April 24th to April 28th with Meta, AMZN, GOOG, and MSFT… with apple the following week. \n\nTesla will be the key to watch Wednesday after hours to start off the earning seasons… for those of you who don’t remember… last earnings Tesla ran 33.34% intra-week and went on to run up a total of about 62% over that month. \n\n**WEEKLY TRADING LOG**\n\n📷\n\nRealistically this says weekly trading log but this is just my intraday trading log as I was gone Monday through Thursday and didn’t take any trades… I did open some 98dte (current) DTE 405p that are down about 20% right now though… \n\nTo clarify here a SCALP for me uses the 1 minute chart primarily for entry with a few different indicators and is playing a bounce or rejection generally off the 1 minute time frame with a shorter expected hold generally holding for the full cycle of the 1min DMI. A Level to Level play for me involves the use of 15min supply and demand, ORB (opening range breakout strategy) with primarily taken entries based off the 5min and 15min candle price action with 1min help for a good entry. \n\nWas able to hit just over 50% of my WEEKLY goal intraday today… it was a killer morning playing some beautiful scalps that ran aggressively for me. I gave back quite a bit mid day as I still struggle finding good entries and mostly continuation from that noon to 2pm time frame much like the last few weeks of trading. \n\nOverall a great day of trading and for me I was so excited to get home to start trading I couldn’t be happier with todays results. Looking forward to next week trading. \n\nI did end up swinging some 3dte (Monday expiration) 4135P due to the fact that IV was so incredibly low (it was almost in the 7% range) when I opened them and the fact that I believe the VIX will recoil Monday with the dollar and 10YR which should provide a downside push on SPY.", "id": "12meva5", "created_utc": 1681509104.0, "score": 142, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 74, "comments": [{"body": "Welcome back.
