{"title": "A mild recession is bullish", "selftext": "A recession is bullish because it will bring down inflation. Lower inflation will lead to an end in rate hikes. The market is forward looking, we can be in a recession and pump to the moon. So long as their is a clear pathway out of the recession, the market will pump during the recession. \n\nEven if you disagree, this is the mood of the market. Bearish news that brings down inflation has pumped the market on multiple occasions. Usually this happens the day after a large panic dump. I believe the market will realize the bullishness of the impending recession at market open. Futures are already green. \n\nToday and Friday will be an extremely powerful bullish rally. Not only because this inflation crushing recession‚Äî bank earnings are going to light the fuse to the moon. \n\nJPM and mega banks have received billions in new deposits. JPM especially has profited wildly from the banking crisis, yet their stock is DOWN. JPM‚Äôs ER will quell these fears that it was harmed from the crisis‚Äî a crisis that has already been canceled. \n\nI believe JPM stands to pump the most off this bullish recession news and their ER beat‚Äî which is guaranteed to happen. I know deep in my heart the JPM will beat their earnings estimates, there is a zero % chance they don‚Äôt have a beat. The expectations are so low.\n\nHow can the market possibly turn bearish when there is so much amazing news coming out? Inflation will be finally be killed, rate hikes will end and we can pump to the moon. \n\nJPM call position: https://imgur.com/gallery/4PwuCh8", "id": "12kg4b5", "created_utc": 1681371012.0, "score": 17, "upvote_ratio": 0.63, "num_comments": 73, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|10|**First Seen In WSB**|2 years ago\n**Total Comments**|448|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|3 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "mild recession reminds me of transitory inflation ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Inflation is actually transitory.\n\nThe prevailing sentiment on this sub is to make fun of JPOW for saying inflation is transitory.
