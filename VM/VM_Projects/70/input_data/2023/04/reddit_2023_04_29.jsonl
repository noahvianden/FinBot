{"title": "3 year results - seems like delta works :)", "selftext": "Long time lurker, first time poster. Been a buy and hold investor for almost 10 years, started working with options in 2019 to generate income, enter positions at prices I like and trim/exit positions I wanted to exit. The core portfolio is all large cap mostly US listed stocks, and I write options on the same types of stocks. TL/DR - if you're looking for FRC/GME/BBBY/TSLA you won't find them here. I wanted to share some stats from my results - basically confirming that over time and with enough data, delta works.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOver time what I've found works best is 30-50 DTE. I try and avoid earnings and ex-dividend dates if I can, but each trade is very stock specific. I only sell monthlies, no weeklies.  I  sell puts on stocks I want to own, and calls if I think there's value. I'm comfortable with both getting assigned or letting options expire. I don't use stops, and will only close out a position early if it's hit at least 85% of the maximum payoff. The one bad habit I have is not closing out everything on options expiry date. I figure I'd rather let them expire worthless than give away $2 or $3 each time. It's never cost me anything, even though everyone recommends to close out before expiry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's my results for the last couple years. After selling around 280 options.\n\n· When selling ITM, I get assigned 75% of the time\n\n· When selling at 40-50 Delta, I get assigned 50% of the time\n\n· When selling at 30-40 Delta, I get assigned 30% of the time\n\n· When selling at 20-30 Delta, I get assigned 20% of the time\n\n· When selling at 10-20 Delta, I get assigned 14% of the time\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSample size isn't huge - close to 300 contracts over the last 3 years.
