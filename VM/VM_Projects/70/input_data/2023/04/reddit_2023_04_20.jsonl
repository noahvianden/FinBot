When she arrived at work, she accidentally knocked over a mug of coffee, which spilled all over her desk.\n\nSarah began to worry that her day was going to be filled with bad luck and misfortune. As she checked the stock market, she noticed a slight dip in the market index. Sarah became convinced that this was a sign that the market was going to crash, and she quickly sold all her stocks in a panic.\n\nAs days passed, Sarah watched in horror as the stock market continued to rise. She realized that her belief in superstitions and unfounded assumptions had caused her to make hasty and irrational decisions.

{"title": "4/20 Yearly ASTS Update - Mixed bag or Future winner?", "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f6u0algfw1va1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=ecc0f1d62b923de789e352c4ea1e9af93aceddb4\n\nDisclaimer: *I am only posting this yearly update as a way for me to journal my thinking and for future bragging rights (or to become an eternal WSB* 🤡). I am documenting my way to an 8 digit portfolio by the end of the decade.\n\nFellow degens,\n\nHere is my **yearly 4/20 update** on holding $ASTS ([AST SpaceMobile](https://ast-science.com/)). Safe to say, if you had bought last year at $8 \\[[4/20 Update 2022](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/u7s7lm/the_gamechanger_in_mobile_broadband_connectivity/) \\-- I invite you to read it for some context\\] and held until now, you would be down >45%. Ouch. You would have underperformed (euphemism) both SPY and QQQ by a wide margin over the past 12 months... Ouch (twice). At least, I did. Ouch (again).\n\nHowever, you would have had plenty of opportunities to sell along the way at $9 in June, $14 in August and $9 in November. And this would have put you well ahead of the indices last year in a down market. It has also outperformed it's peers (deSPACs are down c.60% over the same period and space-related deSPACs have mostly become pennystocks -- a few exceptions exist).\n\nAlthough, I have been proven wrong so far (return-wise) and feel I jumped the gun too early. I continue to believe this is a company to follow closely. Here is why.\n\n# Recap of last year, where I was wrong and where I wasn't\n\nLast year, I had identified four categories of risks: launch, technology, funding and regulatory.\n\n**I was wrong**. The launch didn't happen in June 2022 but was delayed to September 2022 (not the first time there is a delay with the company). However, **I was right** in guessing that the company had really well engineered it's deployment system and everything went out smoothly.\n\n**I was right**. The technology to connect the satellite directly to an unmodified phone works ([CEO tweet](https://twitter.com/AbelAvellan/status/1647643784291704832)). I am expecting a formal event in the coming months to announce it with AST's partners (AT&T, Vodafone, Rakuten, etc.).\n\n**I was right**. There seems to be a huge market for the service. Mind you. Last year, nobody was talking about D2D (direct-to-device) -- it was deemed impossible by industry professionals (just like landing a rocket was deemed impossible). Now, Apple/GSAT, Starlink/TMUS, IRDM/QCOM are all working on the opportunity. Do you think a trillion dollar company and multi-billion ones would do that if there was no demand?\n\nThat's a paradigm shift I didn't expect. Also, I believe AST to be a few years ahead at the very least (after the recently announced delay by Starlink and Samsung not adopting QCOM's solution).\n\nIt also seems like the FCC is doing a full 180 on regulations to accomodate for this new market. Something to watch closely.\n\n**I was wrong**. I didn't see how shit the market would become and how difficult it would be to raise money in last year's environment. I am certain the constellation will get funded, too many stakeholders want to see it happen. Yes. **I was right**. Last year, AST had 17 partners under agreement and now they have **35 agreements covering more than 2bn people**.\n\n# Is the risk/reward still as good?\n\nAt today's price, I still believe it could be a multideca-bagger and why not dream a little for a 100-bagger (it's valued at <1% of Starlink, yes Starlink, not accounting for SpaceX) by the end of the decade.\n\nOn the risk-side, we now know the technology works, they are able to deploy the satellite and close the connection. Remember. **This was something even industry professionals thought was impossible**.\n\nMoreover, there has been no insider sales (not even the SPAC sponsor -- find me another company where that is the case). The last insider buys were at $5.5 and I am sure it's nice to buy below them (offers some comfort on the downside).\n\nThe technicals seem to indicate that we have double-bottomed.\n\n# What's next?\n\nThere is a regulatory ruling by the FCC tomorrow (4/20).\n\nAs mentioned earlier, I expect an event of some sort with AST's MNO partners (AT&T, Vodafone, etc.).\n\nI expect hard contracts and funding arrangements to follow or be announced at such an event.\n\nA successful test launch of Starship (highly unlikely) is a small bonus as it will signficantly lower cost of launch.\n\nI still think this is not for everyone. I believe that I shall be fine hodling long term. I know that for most of you long term is 5 hours and the only fundamental research you do is based on price action over the past week.\n\nRisk of this going to 0 is still significant and it has been a dud so far.\n\n# Position\n\nI bought 2,000 more shares since last year. 42,000 shares ([proof\\_1](https://ibb.co/XDWkSBL) \\+ [proof\\_2](https://ibb.co/RHH1Px7))\n\nTL;DR: Well, I am one year older and still full of cum. The reward is identical to last year but now with less risk as the technology has been proven. Still a **potential** 100 bagger by the end of the decade -- only company I know who can immediately tap 2bn customer once service becomes live.\n\nSee you next year.\n\n[2021 Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n6b5f9/asts_a_global_mobile_broadband_solution/)\n\n[2022 Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/u7s7lm/the_gamechanger_in_mobile_broadband_connectivity/)", "id": "12t13m2", "created_utc": 1682001581.0, "score": 113, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 71, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|7|**First Seen In WSB**|2 years ago\n**Total Comments**|620|**Previous Best DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/u7s7lm/the_gamechanger_in_mobile_broadband_connectivity/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/snmgpy/astr_kerrisdale_capital_short_report_rebuttal/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12t13m2/420_yearly_asts_update_mixed_bag_or_future_winner/) \n**Account Age**|8 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I also have the unfortunate privilege of being ahead of the markets on this one.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "for a stock pumped here on WSB the fact that its only down 45% and not 90%+ is hella bullish!", "score": 42, "replies": [{"body": "😮‍💨", "score": 11, "replies": []}]}, {"body": ">Only6Inches, I appreciate your analysis and thoughts on AST SpaceMobile.

If we break through those levels and close we would then start to target 406.61 demand and 405.17 supply. \n\nMy ultimate target and where I hope to sell my 92dte puts is 399.07.\n\nWe are seeing price action signal a downside move now and we are attempting to break extreme momentum on SPY daily. \n\nSomething I will touch more on tomorrow night is that we are also attempting (if we hold here at close tomorrow) to turn this 412.63 weekly double top into a new supply… That would mean we have taken out 409.98 weekly supply and can begin targeting 385.9 demand down below… granted I don’t think we will get that low its where our target would be until a new weekly demand comes in. \n\n**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7op19zdh14va1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=723f57e2ac531642670756d49f4d699b2c80fe7d\n\nWe for the first time in almost a month of trading have officially closed a daily candle below the 8ema… this is the first step in a bearish reversal… however, until momentum is fully broken and starts to push down we could still see the 20ema bounce us which should be right around that 409 price area tomorrow. \n\nWe also have a new breakout triangle forming here at 412.2 resistance and 408 support tomorrow. \n\nThe bears ideally want to see this close under 408 tomorrow and under the daily 20ema… IF we get that closure then I would start targeting 405.2… However if we close back over the daily 8ema tomorrow at 412 then realistically upside target would be the 414-415 area again. \n\nSPY Daily Levels  \n Supply- 409.7 -> 405.2  \n Demand- 409.2 -> 406.6  \n Support- 409.6 -> 409.1 -> 408  \n Resistance- 412 -> 414.2\n\n**FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ef2tkpth14va1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ef1e16176e9f938bdfce671280d3f03ec4b4d15\n\nI have said a few times now I prefer watching supply and demand on the daily for futures as the price action is far more smooth then SPY… this continues to be the case and I continue to see 4178 supply as a key resistance. With a closure under the daily 8ema we should once again start to target 4116 demand. IF we break through that level we have a pretty steep descent to 4040/4055. \n\nWeekly wise we are attempting to establish a new 4173 supply which takes out current weekly 4149 supply and makes our downside target at 4055 supply. \n\n**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w36gobai14va1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=27eff4c31616c9b5cf99c274d0deae8ae11ea76d\n\nWe once again broke pretty much the last support I see from this bull run up today.

Of course I got stop loss hunted 2 times in a row and took some small profits on the way down… I missed out on that whole leg down as I kept waiting for a good reentry that didn’t feel like chasing. \n\nI was very salty getting stopped out and then it immediately rejected back to a profitable spot. But that’s the name of the game. We cant always and wont always get every move and our timing as much as we try to be perfect will never be perfect every single time….
