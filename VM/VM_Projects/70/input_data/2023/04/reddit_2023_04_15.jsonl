Too bad he couldn’t convince Nixon of it and was repeated at odds with his friend throughout his term. Nixon had hoped their friendship would help him dictate to the Fed, it did not. He did have an easy time teaching his students Alan Greenspan and Milton Friedman about the needs for price stability. Both of whom would go on to champion price stability for the rest of their lives.\n\nJust like then, monetary policy alone still isn’t enough. Higher taxes, higher gov spending are needed for a soft landing here. We need an all government approach. The Fed can add and decrease liquidity but it’s not in charge of where that money goes.
