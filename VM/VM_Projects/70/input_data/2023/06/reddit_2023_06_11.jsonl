{"title": "would like an opinion on selling AAPL/MSFT shares", "selftext": "My stock portfolio is about 50% VOO/25% VGT and a bunch of individual stocks from different sectors. VOO and especially VGT are super heavy on AAPL & MSFT as it is. The indiviaul Apple and Microsoft stocks I own make up about 15% of that remaining 25% of my portfolio. I bought them when they were really cheap in October 2022 and have held them since for some great returns. Now I am wondering if I should sell them and allocate into that \\~15% into VIG or SCHD or other individual companies for more diversity. \n\nAdvice appreciated - ty!", "id": "14783di", "created_utc": 1686524134.0, "score": 32, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 68, "comments": [{"body": "I‚Äôd hold them and steadily add more shares of vig/voo/schd/etc until your portfolio is more balanced to your liking.", "score": 38, "replies": []}, {"body": "Never sell.
