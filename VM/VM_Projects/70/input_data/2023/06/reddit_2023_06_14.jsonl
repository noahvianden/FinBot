TIPs provide the lowest return because of the amount of protection they give against losses. This return can be detrimental depending on your long term strategy. If you choose a low return investment early while assets are at a lower price you will have to pay a higher price later for the same assets. This in turn can negatively impact your overall return long term if you plan to hold those assets long term.
