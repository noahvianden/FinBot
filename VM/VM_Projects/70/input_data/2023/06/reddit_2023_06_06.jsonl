{"title": "New bull market? OR just a massive fucking bear market?", "selftext": "A lot of the technical indicators and structure of a bear market have already been fucked by this move up, is this because there is no bear market or is it because market makers are trying to fuck us. At this point it seems most people are more bullish than anything, will they really keep letting us make money with calls?!\n\nFor much longer I doubt it, the vix has been absolutely beaten down and usd seems like it's going to follow the same path which will undoubtably allow the market to push higher, I mean after all last year was for the bears and a lot of people had to get out of the market, and while that was happening there has been a build up of cash and people spending credit card money which in turn supplied more money to people to rich old dudes who can invest, so I believe those dudes are gonna push this shit higher in the near term, also it's summer time so old people are probably gonna spend more money and teenagers are probably gonna try and get more summer jobs which will make the economy stronger and push the markets. If bulls are lucky AI will push some big tech earnings and the SPY could see 440-450 within 2 months.\n\nAlthough this move may be sustainable with so many people eager to get back into stocks and use their excess money to buy all this tech up, eventually things may take a turn. Now, September is typically a shit month for stocks based on seasonality and the fed may have already paused or pivot by then, but I believe that somewhere between September of this year and January of next year that stocks are going to reverse back to the gae ber side and if this deep ass yield curve is actually right which it always is supposedly then a reversal in the stock market must be guaranteed at least by February of next year, and don't go and give me any of that \"oh but the market if forward looking, so bullish\", no fuck you, if that was the case we'd be at lows right now, it's not that forward thinking, I'd say it looks forward maybe about a month or two from now, but it's definitely not pricing in a possible collapse in earnings and jobs, now I'm not saying big tech can't clutch and keep the market from falling, but at it's current levels it would have to do a lot of work to keep the market from getting fucked if say everything else starts to fall.\n\nSo what are my expectations for the market during this possible drawdown, well if the yield curve and this massive possible bear market rally is anything to go on, I'd say pretty big, because if the market continues to move up or sideways from here the 200 long term moving average will probably be at 381 or 386 on SPY and if the market does eventually price in a recession it's likely it will breakthrough this long term moving average at the time it's falling which usually causes massive selling due to it's bearish nature, assuming it would cross. But for all we know, market makers and Jim Cramer are just trying to lure in as many people as possible before this epic collapse. Anyways let me know what you think, (im usually a gae ber) if the recession comes (if it's not already here) then I believe it will fuck the market significantly as it sets in, probably in what I assume would be in the time frame of starting from September 2023 - January 2024 of next year, the reversal will definitely start somewhere there, probably, and I think at the end of all that, SPY will bottom somewhere between 380 - 330. I say 380 assuming tech is strong af and stays that way for a year or two and 330 assuming the recession fucks the market bad, more banks start getting fucked, and tech dies down. I think somewhere around 330 is most likely, because eventually SPY will break the 200 moving average with all the upcoming FUD and when it does, it's game over, no cap.\n\nTLDR: I think SPY will go higher near term, 440-450 within 2 months possibly. Longer term I think SPY will start a reversal that inevitably ends between 380-330 and starts in about 3-7 months", "id": "142gw8p", "created_utc": 1686059737.0, "score": 53, "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "num_comments": 73, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|10|**First Seen In WSB**|5 months ago\n**Total Comments**|381|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n>TL;DR: I think SPY will go higher in the near term, possibly to 440-450 within 2 months.
