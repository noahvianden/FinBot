{"title": "Playing AI earnings is a short term money glitch which cannot go tits up (or can it?)", "selftext": "AI mania looked to be over in late May, with SPY dipping to $412 just before NVDA's mammoth forward guidance spawned a new era of relentless Shrek appendages and cancelled the upcoming recession. I wasn't in on NVDA (congrats to all who were) because I don't know anything about AI, GPUs, wafers and so on.\n\nIn fact I don't know anything about anything that can make me money, apart from recognising FOMO. Which I did.\n\nI dipped my regarded toes in the water with $AI earnings, and 6x-ed what was sadly a smallish amount ($800). I then started looking for the next decent AI play and found ADBE, bought some $435c early this month. They dipped, I averaged down, and trying to be sensible I cashed out with a 5x (obviously could've been a lot more).\n\nI think I missed out on a couple of others (Oracle?) but the same thing predictably happened there I believe. \n\nNow I'm looking at upcoming AI earnings plays and the ones that stand out are $TSM in mid July and $INTC end of July. I've taken small positions (calls) in both but not much point yolo-ing yet as I'd just be paying for theta I don't need.\n\nAs far as I can tell, best way to profit from this madness is to buy calls expiring just after earnings with strike about 25% higher than current price, and do it about 7-10 days out from earnings. Then sell just before earnings or hold through earnings if confident. \n\nSo after having tasted the sweet nectar of success without gorging myself, I now have a couple of weeks to decide how much of my portfolio to spunk on these plays. Obviously the part of my monkey brain that likes instant gratification is telling me I've found a short term money glitch and I should YOLO into TSM then parlay into INTC, 8x them both, and then never trade again. I'm finding it hard to disagree.\n\nThe only way they can go tits up is a huge general market crash in the week or so between buying and selling, or a Chinese invasion of Taiwan (which would kill TSM but actually moon INTC). Both of those are unlikely IMO.\n\nQuestion: Am I right? Or am I the blissfully ignorant embodiment of what happens to bubbles just as they are ready to burst?\n\n\nTLDR: SEEMS LIKE PLAYING AI EARNINGS IS A MONEY GLITCH.
