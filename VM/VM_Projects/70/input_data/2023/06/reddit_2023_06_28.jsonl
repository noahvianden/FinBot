Profitable revenue is important. If they show they can make a profit on a competitively priced vehicle and if its performance is solid enough to overcome its polarizing looks, it might be seen as a viable competitor to the F150, Silverado, and RAM. If that happens and if Tesla can show a production ramp that gets them to 1MM units a year in a couple years, the stock will respond. \n\nIt's not going to happen that way, though. Tesla will show they can make money on it, it will be priced reasonably, and it will perform well but not so outstandingly that traditionalists will overlook the styling.
