However, there are multiple variables to consider when deciding whether to sell or hold onto your Meta stock. One key factor is that while Apple's Vision Pro is miles ahead of the Meta Quest or Oculus, Meta might become a winner in the VR/AR industry once it becomes mainstream. This is because most people won't be able to afford the Apple Vision Pro.\n\nIf Meta can convince other VR/AR manufacturers to use their software, MetaOS, for their products, it could achieve a higher market share than Apple in the AR, VR, and mixed reality market. This would give Meta access to a larger user base and reduce their need to invest heavily in hardware, focusing more on software for their own headset and other manufacturers. This could be a key advantage for Meta, similar to how Google has 80% of the smartphone market with Android, even though only 0.7% of that is with the Google Pixel in Q1 2023.\n\nIf Meta takes this approach, its share price could skyrocket once the VR/AR and mixed reality market becomes mainstream. This is just a personal perspective on what could realistically lead to Meta's success in the AR/VR industry", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}
