Is it unreasonable, probably not, however, fundamentally, I could make serious arguments as to why that is definitely on the higher end of the historical range of PE multiples. NOW, the caveat here is if you expect earnings to increase 10% in 2024 on the aforementioned estimates, which would take the S&P 2024 EPS number to $269.00 per share --- at current market pricing, that would put the Forward PE of the S&P @ 16.475x, which isn't expensive at all.\n\nQuestion really becomes is that achievable in 2024? My answer, at least as we sit here today, is that EPS in 2024 are more than likely to come DOWN rather than UP, therefore, eventually, the market may see a relatively solid pullback BUT, again, I have been buying the SPY for nearly 15 years, I've seen markets run to a 23 PE and as low as 11x PE (to my recollection) so I just simply ride the wave, reinvest the dividend and buy when I think prices are reasonable.
