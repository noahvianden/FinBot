My success rate over my trading career has been negative. \n\nThere are a lot of posts like this that float around.\n\nThe problem is that you will never be 'ready'. You can know all the theories in the world, and take all the classes you want. Until you actually learn by doing, you've got an incomplete picture. And you can absolutely have a winning record without having an idea what you're doing. \n\nThe average user of this sub just wants an alternative to buy and hold. Not to get better gains, but to feel like they have an active role in their investments. That's why the wheel is so popular. It's basically buy and hold with capped losses and gains. Given that markets GENERALLY trend upwards, this will almost always result in lower gains. But it feels real nice in a bear market.\n\nTalking about studies without citing which studies doesn't really do much. Who's to speak to their validity? But it's not entirely wrong. Most retail traders lose money. But most traders period lose money. Or at the very least underperform the broader market.  To claim you can best the market consistently is to claim you're in the top 1%.\n\nJimmy two stocks thinks he can outsmart jp Morgan because jp Morgan has rules they don't have to follow. If they want to dump their entire port on am nvda call for earnings they can do that. No port manager can do that without being blackballed. And if you did that last earnings call? That's basically winning the lottery.\n\nAlso people have an ego. I think I'm a pretty smart guy. Smarter than most. I look at these 10-15% per year posts and I believe I can do better. I realize a lot of that comes from a lack of experience and I'm aware of that. I'm smart enough to know I don't know everything and that a lot of learning will be required to get to that level. But I'm never going to get there if all I do is read about it.\n\nI think people conflate win percentage with level of success. If I am successful in 100% of my trades and it yields a fraction of a percent is that really a win? Some would say yes. I'd say they're wasting their time and money for pennies. You could spend that time working at a job and earn more.\n\nI agree the average person shouldn't trade options. The average person shouldn't trade period. Options are infinitely more complex than trading shares. And the potential for complete loss (Going to 0) is much higher. But that's what makes them fun =p.\n\nI think the biggest reason people lose money is because they trade on a 'what if' premise. They open a trade and even when they win, what if it goes higher? So they ride it back down and close at a loss. And what if it comes back up? They hold and take a bigger loss. If they'd had a game plan of when to get in and out, they might do well. Unfortunately the psychology of missed gains feels as bad or potentially even worse than taking a loss. And separating emotions from money, when money drives so much of the world, is a hard sell.
