Nothing is set in stone, those things do not exist in this domain.\n2. The indicator signals a recession is coming. What it doesn't say is WHEN. Sometimes it took 6 months, some others over 2 years.\n3. After curve inverts, there are usually two intermediate steps before a recession. First, the curve normalizes (the economy is seen weakening, and short rates go down). Second, you see junk bond spreads widen by a significant margin, whether steeply or more slowly. None of those two things is even in sight right now.\n4. even if it all plays out as you expect, what does that tell you about what the market is gonna do? Nothing. Going into recessions, sometimes the market goes up, sometimes it goes down. People need to get it out of their brains that what happened between 2007 and 2009 is the norm. You can't draw a stock market recession playbook from there.\n\nTo quote a wise person who walked this earth and preceded us by a couple of thousand years and then some: \"No man ever steps in the same river twice, for it's not the same river and he's not the same man\"", "score": 69, "replies": [{"body": "The yield curve at its simplest reflects dropping rates over time.

They don't even look at the market.  If middle class people are employed and putting into the stock market there is a sort of consistent upwards gravity going into the market.  If the middle class unemployment rate gets high enough this upwards gravity shrinks, maybe even pauses.\n\nShort term traders are mostly motivated by fear and greed.  Some aim to predict where the economy will be 6-12 months from now, others predict a week to month from now, others predict intraday movements, and others on a smaller time frame than that.  For these types anything in the news will spike the market up or down, buying or selling based on these emotions.  Right now it's that the Fed will halt interest rate hikes, which is bullish regardless if the rumor is true or not, and the other is that the debt ceiling crisis has been averted, also bullish.\n\nLet's say enough people get laid off so less 401k money is going into the market.  S&P continues to go up but at a reduced rate.  If this slows down enough traders start getting fearful.  Maybe they don't even know unemployment is rising yet, but they do see the charts stalling.  They start to pull out.  Enough pull out and the market starts to fall.  This is what happens during the top of a normal recession.\n\nYes, not all recessions do this.  COVID had the highest unemployment rate of any recession, yet it was all people who don't invest to begin with, so that gravity upwards never went away.  Traders freaked out, but when the Fed swooped in to save the day traders got greedy.  This created a bull run during a recession.\n\nIt's really as simple as breaking the players up into their different groups and then empathizing with them.

I closed 4 positions and opened 4. One of the positions I opened I also closed. One of the positions I closed, I rolled. I also let two other positions expire.\n* The position I rolled (closing then opening a new one with a later expiration) was the PCS side of my XOP Iron Condor (IC). I rolled the position 30 more days out for a credit of $22 after commissions. I let the CCS side of the IC expire worthless for a 100% gain on the spread.\n* The other position I allowed to expire this week was my MSFT Call Credit Spread. This position expired at a max loss of $381 ($500 less credit received).\n* The next position was a two-parter. I had an existing CRM CCS. I opened a new PCS on the same ticker to create an IB. I would end up closing the IB position two days later for a total loss of $121. Had I not opened the PCS portion of the IB I would have been able to close the position for a gain after CRM dropped significantly after its earnings report. Oh well. \n* The next position I opened but then closed within 24 hours. On Tuesday this week I decided to open a CCS on NVDA once it hit $410. I opened the CCS with the short strike at $500 and the long strike at $510. This one I got right. NVDA would fall rapidly within the next 24 hours, and I closed the position for 50% profit, which is good for one day.\n* The next position I opened this week was a new XOP PCS for 14 JUL for a credit of $195.\n* The last position I opened this week was a CSP with 3 contracts on F. I received $60 per contract ($180 total) to open this position. \n* So, after a disappointing two weeks, I believe I am back where I need to be. I could still get burned by ORCL and QQQ but my other positions should make up for them if they continue to move against me. In the near term I will be diversifying more so I am not overweight in any single sector. The two times I’ve been burned were when I was overweight first in financials and then in tech.

That’s why I’m here. To learn the mechanics of managing those.
