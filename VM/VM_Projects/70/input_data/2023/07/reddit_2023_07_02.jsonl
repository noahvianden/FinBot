If anything he was lying and buying calls because I‚Äôm sure he gets some good inside info from Jensen considering how much he‚Äôs sucked his dick in the past. \n\nI look at stock analysts like I do about fantasy football ones. You gotta read between the lines sometimes and realize that they don‚Äôt want EVERYBODY to see the big time studs that are gonna blow up. They also tend to give safe picks or hot takes. It‚Äôs up to you to decipher their tone or enthusiasm and decide are they saying this because they really believe it or it‚Äôs just some BS their producers are pushing them to say. \n\nLast year we were in the midst of a major correction so it was a good tip to be cautious generally speaking and one way for him to convey that was to appear bearish on a company like Nvidia. He named his damn dog after it and by going bearish on them it was in essence advising retail investors to watch out about the market trending down. \n\nThe thing about Nvidia and Cramer is that he was so gung-ho about their importance in autonomous driving. I think that‚Äôs ridiculous. Autonomous driving should NOT become a thing unless the vehicle is on its own independent lane. I‚Äôm confused why they haven‚Äôt made autonomous airplanes, trains or boats a major topic of innovation before going straight to cars because of everyday driving seems way more random than everything else. Nvidia is gonna kill it in the AR and VR world. They already rule the graphics card market in the flat form and have been for 20+ years. In my opinion gaming graphics has nearly maxed out in 2D.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "He also said it was a sell and to stay away when it was down big.
