{"title": "Started Investing 9/2021 and Finally Break Even", "selftext": "I can't believe that things can turn around so quickly.\n\nI never buy stock prior to September 2021. When inflation was high at that time, I decided to dump all my cash into stock market and thought it would hedge inflation.  I paid for a stock pick service and bought all stocks from their recommendations. I bought SHOP at $1500, UPST, SNOW and ZS at $300, CRWD and DOCU at $280, TTD at $100, TSLA at $800, HUBS at $600, ROKU at $120...\n\nSince 11/2021 the Fed started to crash the market. I kept on DCA, but the more money I added the more I lost. **On 12/31/2022, my loss was around 65% at $800,000.** I was unhappy and mentally stressed the whole time and did not think I can recover the loss one day.\n\nOn 2023, my portfolio started to turn around. All the holdings I have through 2021-2022 are 2X to 4X from the bottom. **Recently both my realized and unrealized gain/loss are finally positive with a whopping +219% gain TYD**.  I still cannot believe how quickly it turns around. I feel I am extremely fortunate.\n\nI wrote this post just want to share my feelings with all bag holders. When you feel there is no light at the end of tunnel, don't loss hope and keep adding money to good companies when their prices are down. Your loss will recover one day.\n\nPortfolio and 2-year&YTD charts:  [https://imgur.com/gallery/kC0YiOk](https://imgur.com/gallery/kC0YiOk)\n\n**===============================Update on 7/12/2023 =======================**\n\n**1)**  To reply to several comments below about me deserve losing all my money,  uneducated, know nothing and is an idiot kid with rich parents, I acknowledge that my initial investment decision and stock selection was very rash and clueless. But such comments and judgements are really not friendly to someone you don't even know in internet . Instead I grew up in a poor family and I am a first generation immigrant here without any relatives in the states. My parents combined are making $1200/month which is highest ever they make.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2)** To answer the question about why I hold these stocks:\n\n**UPST**\n\nPros: Technology is disruptive. Total addressable market is huge. They had two $300+M revenue quarters with positive net income in 2021 when they only had personal loans. Once interest rate goes down and funding constrain is loosen, with their 2 new products car loan and small loan (as well as future new products), the revenue can be $500M quarterly easily. Stock price should be doubled at least if that happens.\n\nCons: When funding constrain will be loosened is questionable. CEO has poor vision and is indecisive and not trustworthy.\n\nComments below questioned my oversized position in UPST. I have large position because I bought it at $300 in 2021, then significantly added shares at $150, $40, $17 and $12 to bring down the average cost. This year my broker paid me 22% interest to borrow all UPST shares from me for short sellers. I was happy to collect the interest thus I did not trim any UPST when price went up from bottom. The interest rate they paid me kept dropping like freefall and reached a lowest point at 5% 2 weeks ago because of less short flow. Last week my broker returned all UPST shares to me because no short sellers borrow it any more. I trimmed my shares by 6% the day before I created this post. I will trim it further if price keeps going up but given it is high potential, it will still be my largest position at 15% to 20% \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**SOFI**\n\nI started to follow SOFI this year and after their last impressive ER stock price dropped surprisingly so I started my position at $5s. The following day analyst downgraded SOFI because \"personal loans are risky\", I doubled my shares at $4s for a total of $60,000 because I thought the downgrade is nonsense. When price went up from there to $10+, multiple analysts downgraded it again with the same reason and so called good-news-already-priced-in. The price dropped by about 10% one day to below $8 in the morning but recovered all loss in the same day! This shows how resistant the price is so i added shares at $8s. \n\nPros: They increased their revenue by 50% YoY without their largest 2 sources of revenue - student loan and mortgage, compared with pre-COVID. With the significant increased number of users in past 3 years, once student loan and mortgage are back like pre Covid, their revenue will be 5X to 10X. It is expected to achieve net income profitability by Q4 2023.  CEO has very good vision (shift focus to personal loans quickly when their main source of income was gone) and is very decisive (when he answered analysts'  doubts about persona loans). CEO heavily loading shares at $4 to $6 boosted my confidence in SOFI.\n\nCons: Hard to give it a fair multiple because there is no comparable companies. Multiple will be low if it is valued as a bank.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**IT Sector: ZS, CRWD, BILL, NET, IOT, GLBE**\n\n**ZS, CRWD** are pretty stable and the least expensive growth stocks among IT sector, given similar margins among companies in this sector but different scales, growth rates, P/S multiples and FCF trending. In comparison:\n\nCompanies like SNOW grow faster but P/S and employee stock compensation are way much higher (I sold out SNOW at $170s)\n\nCompanies like NET, MDB and DDOG grow slower yet their P/S are higher (I sold out DDOG at $90s)\n\nCompanies like S and IONQ grow much faster but their scales are much smaller ($500M quarterly revenue at $40% growth is more impressive then $100M quarterly revenue at 70% growth) and have indefinite timeline of achieving profitability.\n\nThat is why ZS and CRWD win out overall in this sector.\n\nI own **NET** even though it is on the expensive end among IT growth companies because I work for a cyber security company which competes with NET and our management always speak highly of NET\n\n**IOT** is very expensive but they are also very close to profitability and have a large total addressable market. They are the leader in their industry.  What makes them different from other IT companies and deserve higher valuation is that the more a customer spend with them, the more the customer may save on their operating expense so it’s a win-win, thus existing customers will be willing to spend more voluntarily.\n\n**BILL** is another least expensive growth stock in this sector likewise, though their product is nothing innovative and can be easily replicated.\n\n**GLBE** is getting expensive with recent 1-month straight up run regardless Nasdaq is up or down. But I don't know any other player in the market that offers the same product as GLBE\n\nAlso if valuation multiples are similar, I prefer tech companies whose existing customers can spend more with increasing usage/units/endpoints/etc (e.g. ZS, CRWD, IOT, SNOW, MDB, SHOP) over companies that sell software at a flat annual price (such as project management or human resource management software e.g. TEAM, ASAN, MNDY, HUBS - I can be wrong on these 4 companies because I simply looked at their products without checking their ER). Of course companies with higher recurring revenue deserve higher premium.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Healthcare Sector: TMDX, HIMS**\n\n**TMDX**: product is a game changer - In the past, when a donor donated a live organ, the organ had to be stored in a freezer and is good for only a few hours, thus donor and donee have to be in the same geographical location. TMDX's device mirrors human physiology to connect to the organ to keep it alive for much longer period of time, which allows the organ to be transported to a different geographical location. \n\nTheir growth rate and valuation are both very high. Their stock price has highest ceiling in next 1-2 years among all my holdings. It’s the only company that I own will not be impacted by possible incoming economic recession.\n\n**HIMS**: unbelievably cheap. Major concern is regulation (though it has never happened so far). Stock price fell after the last ER because analysts criticized their sales and marketing spending which is non issue to me. Their recurring revenue is 90% so the money they spend in sales and marketing is a good investment to me.\n\nHealthcare sector did not have a run like IT sector so far this year. It is probably a good time to add holdings in healthcare sector.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**MELI**\n\nA stable yet fast growing company dominating south America e-commence market. Their AD revenue and fintech are growing at a very fast pace. Valuation is very reasonable. PE is high but P/FCF is low. Stock analyst Brain Stoffel has best ERs' coverages in Youtube and his analysis in twitter about this company.\n\n**DIS**\n\nI bought it because Disney brought back old CEO in hope of regrowing stock price. The CEO will do whatever to cut cost so I am willing to hold it for 1 to 2 more ERs\n\n**OPEN**\n\nI bought OPEN after their impressive Q1 2022 ER (the only net income positive quarter so far). It trended down from there because of housing market and is finally on an upward trend this year with higher and higher margin month over month. Stock price is 5X this year. Twitter account \"operdoor2\" has OPEN's real time sales and margin data.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOther holdings I have are big names that everyone know about what they do so I will not dig into them: **TSLA, AMD, ENPH, UNH, AMZN**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3)** To answer if I do options, day trade, swing trade and what helped my recover.\n\nI do not do options. I rarely swing trade in 2021-2022 because almost all my holdings were red. I started swing trading several transactions per week this year. This helped me quite a bit to recover my loss.  Just to give a few examples:\n\nI sold $80,000 ZS (and still has $110,000) 2 days ago on Monday (the day before I created this post on Tuesday) when ZS was up 7% on that day to $155 for no news. In the meantime, MELI was down 15% in 2 days because of an analyst’s downgrade (the reason in the downgrade is really a minor issue). This is a 22% (15+7=22) swing so I trimmed ZS and doubled my MELI shares. As of today Wednesday, all shares I added to MELI on Monday are green.\n\nToday ZS is down by nearly 15% to $130s from  $155 just 2 days ago because of the news about Microsoft being close to release a product to compete with ZS, I added 100 shares ZS today while most of my other holdings are green as I don't think it is that easy and quick for MS to have any impact on ZS.\n\nWhy I had such large percentage of positions nearly $200,000 in ZS prior to the trimming on Monday? It’s not because I have higher conviction on it over other IT stocks I own, it’s because from 2/15 to 5/1 this year, ZS dropped from $140s to $85 and kept on hitting a new 2-year low over and over again and was significantly underperformed than any other tech growth stocks I own or watch during that 2.5 month span (e.g. CRWD price was $120 in both 2/15 and 5/1). I kept adding shares to ZS on its way down especially heavily at $87 and $85 on around 5/1. My total shares of ZS is more than tripled after that. Fast forward to this week, I trimmed 40% of shares at $150s. So when you own 15 growth sticks, you can compare their weekly, monthly and 3-month charts and choose the worst performed stocks to DCA if there is no major company specific bad news. This turns out well for me. \n\nYesterday right before I created this post, I sold out my UBER position for profit taking (UBER will be a cash cow BTW so I am looking to add it back when price pulls back) and increased my shares of TSLA and AMD when both of them had 2 red days in a row  this Monday and Tuesday while all my other growth stocks performed very well in these 2 days. To answer one of the comment below about my cost basis of AMD and TSLA being high - It is because in the past one month I sold 2/3 of my AMD and TSLA shares at near recent peak at $130s and $270s respectively for 30% profit taking and added them back when their prices had 5% to 15% pull back.\n\nWhenever there is an analyst downgrade, more often than not, I feel it is because institute buyers want to load up their shares so they hammer the stock price as low as possible prior to buying. If the reason for downgrading is nonsense or minor, or are repeat downgrades using the same reasons,  I add shares. This works very well for me so far. After UPST was down to $40 last year, analysts used same reasons to repeatedly downgraded it for 9 months all the way down to $12, I loaded up shares at $40, $17 and $12. Fast forward to today it’s $44.\n\nAlso post ER overreaction is a good time to add shares. I follow ABNB's last 5 ERs and their price always dropped after ER even though every ER was great (The explanation of the drop is that high valuation stocks' ER need significant beat rather than just moderate beat). ABNB stock price awalys recovered in 1-3 weeks after post ER drop. This happens every single time. I sold out $60,000+ ABNB last week with 20%-25% gain when it reached $130s. Same for CRWD last ER, it was perfect but price dropped 10% post ER, I added shares post ER and price recovered to pre ER level in 2 days.  And SOFI last ER too, it recovered the post ER and downgrade price drop to raise from $4s back to $6 within 2-3 weeks (as I mentioned earlier, I opened my position of SOFI for a total of $60,000 at $5s and $4s within 24 hours post ER and downgrade)  \n\nSo in short, swing trade and rebalancing  (from short term winner to looser) helped me so far.  Of course it is the microeconomy that drove the recovery primarily, but rebalancing and adding shares after post ER overreaction and nonsense downgrade contribute to probably 20% to 30% of my recovery.", "id": "14x34yk", "created_utc": 1689108717.0, "score": 103, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 107, "comments": [{"body": "lol how does one have so much money without knowing anything about it", "score": 201, "replies": [{"body": "I really hope this is a troll post because I'm malding that OP has more money in this account than my current pay times 40 years and they've apparently never googled \"pump and dump\".", "score": 60, "replies": [{"body": "Its a troll, op is full of shit", "score": 33, "replies": [{"body": "They were posting about shitty ZS a year ago... https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/t0phjh/zscaler_zs_ah_down_16_is_algorithm_overreaction/", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "ZS has 5x it's revenue and the stock has 10x in 5 years.
