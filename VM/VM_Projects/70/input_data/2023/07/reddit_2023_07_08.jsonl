One of the positions I closed I also opened this week.\n\n* Prior to this week I had 1 CSP on TBT. On Monday of this week, I decided to open a second CSP on TBT @ the $31 strike to add to my position. The economic news from this week caused the ticker to move in my favor and I closed out the entire position three days later for a gain of about 57% or $210.\n* The other position I closed out this week was my AAPL CCS. I closed this position for a $180 loss.  The reason I decided to close this position was because I have decided to orient my portfolio more on ETFs whenever I do spreads. I have found ETF based spreads, for whatever reason, work out in my favor far more often than do individual stocks. My three worst weeks this year (weeks 11, 20 and 21) were all due to individual stocks and my best winners continue to be ETFs.\n* This week I also opened three new CCSs on VGT, SPY, and XLY.  I also opened a new IC on XBI and another PCS on XOP, this time 10 strikes wide.\n* Starting this week, I am using two new spread finding tools that I have found to be pretty darn awesome, so we’ll see how they play out. One of these tools I made myself using a combination of different scanners within the Think or Swim (ToS) platform and the other tool I use is a new capability recently added to OptionAlpha. I used them to find all my new spreads this week except for XOP. Hit me up if you want to know more about either of these\n* So, after effectively bouncing off the S&P 500 Index, I am now back on track to where I should be with a currently weekly average of 0.91% after 27 weeks. I do not prefer these big weekly swings, but I believe the big swing this week is due to reorienting my portfolio back to where it needed to be and after some sanity reentered the market.\n\nAcronyms:\n\n* Call Credit Spread (CCS)\n* Put Credit Spread (PCS)\n* Iron Condor (IC)\n* Iron Butterfly (IB)\n* Cash Secured Put (CSP)\n* Covered Call (CC)\n* In-the-Money (ITM)\n* Out-of-the-Money (OTM)", "id": "14u2p4m", "created_utc": 1688818543.0, "score": 120, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 76, "comments": [{"body": "Keep the updates coming, staying tuned with great interest and hope this helps people realize they don't need to swing for the fences every time", "score": 45, "replies": [{"body": "Agreed. people should defintely get away from all or nothing trades.", "score": 20, "replies": [{"body": "What?!?!?!

Super car is a bit of a stretch in my opinion, Rivian is not even in the same zip code as something like a Lambo or a Ferrari.   \n\n\nWhy is it that when a existing car manufacturer  comes out with a new EV no one seems to really care. But some new company with zero track record launches and EV and everyone creams there pants ? The market Rivian is selling to right now is not very large, and assuming they try expand there coverage they will have to start competing with Tesla and other established manufacturers.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Are you dense? Read my comment. I said fast as a super car. Nobody said it’s a Lambo or Ferrari. Same process as GM/Ford? Same can be said for a Lamborghini then I guess. The difference is the material used. Just like my Audi is built the same way as a Ford but a Ford is built with cheap ass plastic and has a shitty interior. \n\nYou’ve been up close to a few Rivians? Jesus Christ, somebody call MotorTrend, this guy is an expert because he’s been up close to a few of them. Until you have driven one, owned one, or been inside one you sound real stupid commenting about one. \n\nPeople care about Rivian because they did something different. A super fast SUV/Truck that’s all electric, an off road beast and built with high quality materials.
