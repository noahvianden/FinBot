{"title": "FedSpeak: Fed member Waller makes it clear there will be 2 rate hikes this year even after recent “Benign” inflation data.", "selftext": "In a surprising turn of events, Federal Reserve Board Governor Christopher Waller made it clear that he remains unmoved by June’s benign consumer inflation data. Waller boldly expressed his desire for the central bank to proceed with not just one, but two additional 25-basis-point rate hikes within the current year.\n\nFutures markets up until today July 13, 2023 are only pricing in one federal reserve rate hike this year. \n\nThe announcement came during Waller’s speech on Thursday, which shook the euphoric market that had only priced in a single rate hike. His remarks challenged the prevailing sentiment and raised questions about the market’s complacency regarding inflationary pressures.\n\nWaller’s stance indicates a more hawkish approach compared to some of his colleagues, who have shown a more cautious outlook on monetary tightening. By advocating for further rate hikes, Waller underlined his conviction in the need for proactive measures to control inflation and maintain economic stability.\n\nWhile June’s consumer inflation data may have seemed benign at first glance, Waller believes that a more assertive response is necessary to address potential inflationary risks. This statement highlights his confidence in the economy’s resilience and his belief that preemptive measures are crucial to prevent future inflationary spikes.\n\nThe market’s initial reaction to Waller’s remarks was one of surprise and caution. Investors had anticipated a more gradual approach from the Federal Reserve, considering the prevailing uncertainty surrounding the recovery from the pandemic-induced recession. However, Waller’s unwavering stance suggests a different path forward.\n\nThe implications of Waller’s statement are far-reaching. If the central bank follows his recommendations, it could lead to a shift in market expectations and potentially impact various sectors. Higher interest rates could affect borrowing costs for businesses and consumers alike, influencing spending patterns and investment decisions.\n\nAs Waller’s remarks reverberate through financial markets, investors and analysts are left to ponder the implications of a more assertive monetary policy. Will the Federal Reserve heed Waller’s call for two additional rate hikes this year? Only time will tell, but his comments serve as a reminder that economic stability and inflation control remain key priorities for the central bank.", "id": "14z0mo5", "created_utc": 1689292641.0, "score": 110, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 76, "comments": [{"body": "I hate to say it, but: *good*.

Now that governments are reigning in some of the spending, I see inflation moderating and central banks moving back to an accommodating stance pretty quickly, including a return to a near zero or even negative interest rate regime. I often hear \"fiscal dominance\" talked about as an exception, but frankly I just think this is the world we live in: the government can drive inflation and deflation with fiscal expansion and contraction, and the FED is relatively powerless to solve the problem with the limited tools it has at its disposal. It's not exactly a searing hot insight, but I don't see how interest rate hikes can resolve supply chain issues, and if it is fiscal expansion that's driving.

The first time we only got out of it with a depression and a war; the second time we skipped the depression and just went for two wars. Either way, government deficits exploded.

What the market needs is serious behavioral corrections before it wrecks everything with its manipulation. High interest rates will do that, because humans and society are irrational overtime. But because of that we are stuck in a negative feedback loop where fed is bought out. And the media is framing the narrative for the masses. Remember it’s an election year coming up. And as you have proven with with your thesis most have a short term view of economics and don’t realize long term implications. It’s basic economics 101. Lowering interest rates only helps service the debt at current levels and only for short periods of time. Long term economics is a thing. It’s a behavioral science. Raising rates pushed the market to be rational, in turn helping them secure their future and think long term. Inflation affects stability in fundamental tenants such as housing and food. Two things out of control for most of America when it comes to inflation. That’s why even all that said fed will have to raise rates more otherwise you will have civil war and riots. But I got a feeling you don’t care, you have horses in the race. But you should because eventually recession and then rates will be lowered again with more quantitative easing. So your right gov and fed is just going to keep rates low to service the debt but they have to make it look like they are trying. A good example is the SVC bank failure a couple months ago. They let it fail so they could pump liquidity into the market via backdoor and market has been booming since. Not a coincidence, it was floundering prior. They had to do it cause they can’t let the big crash and the big pump via QE happen too soon. They need it to happen 1 year before the election so Biden can make it look like he is the reason they recovered when he does his QE. The only way this country will pay off its debt is through a giant bloody war with a superpower or by manipulating/enslaving other weaker nations with its power.

If due to supply chain, the correct thing to do is nothing and wait for supply chains to recover (which we saw over the last 18 months). If it's labor market, then you hike rates. Powell said that inflation started due to supply chains, but now it's become a labor market problem, which is exactly how wage inflation spiral typically starts. \"trillions of 0% dollars\" did not bring inflation up at all during the 2010s decade, so it's not a common sense statement by the way.

It’s not reasonable to expect you or I to lay nationwide telephone cable, but it’s completely reasonable to think that there are wealthy individuals/companies that could afford to do such a thing, so as long as ATT weren’t directly hindering their ability to do so, they shouldn’t have ever been broken up under anti-trust laws. At a certain point, the gov has to step in and stop massive companies from gobbling up competitors in the interest of protecting consumers.\n\n\n> buying a company isn’t buying all the skilled labor it’s buying IP\n\nIt is until it isn’t. When those major players are picking up studios left and right, your options for employment become extremely limited. Indie developers aren’t hiring massive teams of experienced devs, like you mentioned they’re working in small teams and learning to code online.\n\nI do agree a lot of indie games are great, I buy/play a lot of them. But to expect that to be real competition to AAA development studios when the successful ones are going viral with luck as a major factor, the number of indie games that net little to nothing in revenue is magnitudes larger than hugely successful indie titles. \n\nOn top of that, when the big players are buying up these successful smaller studios and taking control of the IP, they’re also taking control of pricing power for future games out of those studios/franchises. And like we’re seeing now these AAA titles have all suddenly jumped up to $70. If indie games were truly a threat, prices would be trending down and equalizing closer to indie prices in order to compete and retain users.
