Now, with the price drops Tesla has been gradually making, legacy carmakers are beginning to understand: Tesla can and will make mass market, low priced EVs. Some of their existing models will convert to a lower price point with minimal aesthetic changes (eg. do we have an initial price point for M3 Highland yet?), other mass market models will be released in the future.
