Then you buy to close the 100 shares of the shorted when it becomes 450 (by which way you will have the 100$ profits).   \nFor this one, it doesnt matter, as you lock 100$ profit by buying to cover at 450, plus you get premium when selling 450P and your shorted shares from 451 will give another 100$ profits, as long as SPY is below 450. You have nothing to lose  \nBut if SPY spikes up in last hour, it could go into 451.   \nThat's when you wanna buy call option just in case. As you have call option, which by definition will flatten your 100 shorted shares at 451. \n\n  \nThis result would be tricky but overall, a) you get premium when selling 450P b) you lock profits from 451 to 450, c) you lost the cost when buying call option. \n\n  \n2) If you are less confident that it could be false breakout, then suggestion is to cover shares slowly. For instance, you can short SPY at 451.0 for 10 shares, short at 450.9 for 10 shares, short at 450.8 at 10 shares .... till short 10 shares at 450.1.   \nSame thing goes again that you still wanna have coverage by having SPY 451C long position in case SPY goes up again. Although you would incur the loss here, but you still get premium from selling 20-30 delta, which should be offset the loss from a) shorting shares cost difference and b) long call option position. \n\n  \n2) can be generalized as delta hedging, which requires more proprietary knwoledges (i.e: SPY Gamma exposures and OI) as well as your expectation on macro data (i.e: CPI or FOMC), but the individual option sellers wont be able to have that much extensive knowledge to cope with, so that's why it's important to stick to have long position (when doing short put) to limit the loss.   \nHopefully it makes sense. \n\n  \nAlso, depending on brokerage, the Hard\\_To\\_Borrow stocks could be tough (i.e: AMC) to be shorted, but if you play mega cap like AMZN/TSLA/NVDA, it shouldnt be a problem for reputable brokerage. I would suggest that small cap short put is fun to do with juicy premium if it works, but there is always chance it doesnt work, so proceed with your own cautions.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "QQQ AMD MU F SPY", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Some things never change  huh", "score": 4, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Please educate me.

It decays “faster” from a theta perspective as well and offers more benefits than a lower delta.\n\nIf a 16 delta gets smashed, the 10 most likely will as well but you took more max loss risk for less credit.\n\nMy strategy has been selling 16 delta puts at market open depending on gap, then closing at 30-50% credit, usually only a couple hours later.\n\nIf the market gaps lower at open and fills up, I may do some call selling around 1:30-2 hours after open, again at 16 delta, call selling doesnt have as much premium as puts so you have to be diligent on your risk management. After doing this for awhile now, call selling blows up more than puts but im still well over a 90% hit rate.\n\nGoodluck and happy trading!
