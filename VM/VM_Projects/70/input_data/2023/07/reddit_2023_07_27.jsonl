No one is making 2,500% gains on Tesla *from where it is right now* (it would need like a $5,000 a share price target for that).  \n\n**People need to be judging their opinions of the future stock price off of market cap** ... not off of *where they bought in*.\n\nWhen it hits $315 a share (I think it will, but might not be until 2024), Tesla is once again a $1tn company - of which there are only a handful in the world.  Can it become a $2tn company (share price $630)?  Maybe, [but then it's getting bigger than Saudi Aramco](https://companiesmarketcap.com/).  Can it become a $3tn company (share price $945)?  Maybe, but then it's bigger than Apple or Microsoft.  \n\nSome of these estimates of becoming a $5tn or $10tn market cap company ... IMO, are just insane.\n\nA *lot* more is going to have to hit for Tesla to get from $1tn to $2tn than just \"FSD finally ships\".  That's been somewhat priced in already. \n Tesla would need dramatic swings upward in energy (promising), or AI making Optimus bot practical and robotaxi real.\n\nFor me, 50/50 chance it gets above $2tn before the end of the decade.  Autos + FSD alone won't really do it.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Without FSD, Robotaxis, and Teslabot?  Yeah, I see your points and even agree to some extent.\n\nHowever with even just FSD alone, a 5T valuation is not really much of a stretch. \n\n*Assumptions:*\n\nTesla sells 10 million car / year (goal is 20 million)\n\nFSD only has a take rate of 50% (I think it will be close to 100%, because of robotaxis)\n\nFSD only adds 50,000 profit for each take (Probably worth significantly more)\n\nFSD would finally transform Tesla from a \"car company\" to a \"software\" company and justify a 25 P/E (Apple, for instance, has a P/E of around 33).\n\nThose assumptions, which I do not think are all that aggressive, get us to a $6.25 trillion valuation.\n\nYou are absolutely free to use other assumptions and fiddle around with the numbers.  But this does show that it is not \"insane\" to think that a $5 trillion valuation is possible.\n\nWe still would need to throw in about a $1 trillion valuation for just the car business itself.  Plus, Teslabot is still hanging around that \\*could\\* easily add more to the value of Tesla than FSD.  I'm still not even modelling that in most of my spreadsheets.  When I do, I get breathtaking numbers; I do not want to let myself get quite \\*that\\* excited yet.  I also ignore energy, as I am not entirely sure I know where Tesla is going with this or even wants to go.\n\nAnd of course, we also need to discount based on the \"shit happens\" nature of investing.  Maybe something really unexpectedly bad happens to Tesla.  Maybe someone is secretly putting the finishing touches on a true FSD in their garage before Tesla can finish theirs.  Who knows.  I think this is probably where most people will have the greatest variance in their models.\n\nI see this happening before 2030, so I use 2030 as where I start the discounting.  I use a 10% discounting (which gives a nice, human friendly near-50% discount to now), and just using where I think the car valuation and FSD valuation could be, and also including the \"shit happens\" discount (which ends up reducing the FSD valuation by 30% when all is said and done), I end up at somewhere between $2.5 trillion and $3 trillion today.", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "[removed]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "\"Hello.
