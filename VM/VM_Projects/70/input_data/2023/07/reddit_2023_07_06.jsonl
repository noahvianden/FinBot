The main aim of QE is to encourage banks to make more loans, thereby increasing the amount of money circulating in the economy, which can lead to economic growth and higher inflation.\n\nOne way QE works is through portfolio effects. In simple terms, the Fed makes new electronic money and uses it to buy U.S Treasury bonds from large banks. The hope is that by buying these safe assets, the Fed can encourage banks to lend that money to businesses and consumers instead, thereby making the economy more active.However, this depends on the banks' willingness to take more risks and lend money.\n\nSince the financial crisis in 2008, and more recently after the Covid-19 pandemic, banks have been more hesitant to lend because they're worried about the risks involved.\n\nEven when the government guaranteed some loans to reduce risk for banks, lending didn't increase as much as the Fed hoped. This means the portfolio effects strategy hasn't worked as well as planned. Instead of lending more, banks are actually buying more Treasury bonds(Hello banks that shit the bed!) - the opposite of what the Fed wants.\n\nTLDR: Reserves are not money.

The statistics clearly show that 70% of the people that would have qualified for this loan forgiveness make 80k or less per year, so the majority will likely not have more disposable income once they begin loan repayments. Especially coupled with predatory loan interest rates. This will not give buyers the leverage they need to participate fully in the economy for years to come\n\n3.

This money is only going into the pockets of debtors, not companies. These loans are provided by banks, and the debts are sold to investors.\n\nThe idea of an economy is fairly straightforward. One person's spending is another person's income. This cycle continues over and over again, which creates an economy.

Given the tight labor market, I think this could actually be possibly inflationary on the labor side as educated workers demand higher payment.\n4. Debtors as you call them (again, I think you mean creditors) are indeed companies and individuals who lent money and expect a return. In the case of federal student loans, that is the US taxpayer.
