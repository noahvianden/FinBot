The Solar Squeeze**\n\nNot content with dominating Earth and Mars, Tesla has its sights set on the sun. Elon's secret plan is to build solar farms so massive they'll be visible from Alpha Centauri. The energy produced will power every Tesla on the planet, and the excess will be sold to alien civilizations (assuming they pay in Dogecoin). With this revolutionary move, Tesla's stock is guaranteed to blast off!\n\n**6. AI-Powered Gigafactories**\n\nElon is renowned for his AI prowess, and he's putting it to good use in Tesla's Gigafactories. Picture sentient robots working tirelessly to churn out more electric cars than we could ever dream of. And if any of them start dancing like Boston Dynamics' robots, Tesla's stock might as well be fueled by pure joy!\n\n**7. The Dogecoin Connection**\n\nNow, you may be wondering why I keep mentioning Dogecoin in relation to Tesla. Well, it's simple: Elon loves memes, and Dogecoin is the meme-iest of them all! Rumor has it that every time the Tesla stock price hits a new high, Elon celebrates by dressing up as a Shiba Inu and tweets a Dogecoin meme. The power of memes is undeniable, and with this connection, Tesla's stock will surely shoot for the stars (and maybe even to the moon).", "id": "14pgk3w", "created_utc": 1688384213.0, "score": 43, "upvote_ratio": 0.61, "num_comments": 78, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|9|**First Seen In WSB**|2 years ago\n**Total Comments**|88|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\nHey /u/AntiquesAndSo, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.\n>TL;DR: Tesla is on the verge of taking over the world with its innovative products, meme-powered marketing, and badass team of Musk-eteers.
