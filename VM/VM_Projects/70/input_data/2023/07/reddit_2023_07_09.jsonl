Imagine spending most if not all of your time obsessing over the actions of a CEO whose comments an relationships to other people have no effect on you. It's like people who watch reality TV.  \n\nSecondly, Reddit very much encourages group think and discourages any dissenting or unpopular opinions by nature of it's voting system. It's popular to hate on Musk because he is controversial. So making a comment that agrees with the popular thing will get upvoted but those that do not will get ignored or even worse downvoted into oblivion. That's it.
