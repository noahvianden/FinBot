I wanted to buy more but then I was afraid they both would go down resulting me in a great loss. \n\nFast forward now, Apple is $194 and Amazon $133. would it be worth for me to try to buy more Amazon and Apple shares or should I wait until they drop a bit? \n\nPerhaps, should I take the money and buy ETFs or indexes like VOO ?\n\nYour advise will be greatly appreciated. \n\nI started investing back in 2021. \n\nThanks!
