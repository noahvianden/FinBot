No USDC or Tether needed.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I'm not saying you need to use it, I'm saying that tether is used to manipulate the price of BTC. \n\nTheoretically, it should work that people buy USDT (tether) with real money, and the tether devs bank / short-term invest that real money so that when someone wants to cash it out, they have the funds available. As you've described, its purpose should be a temporary store of value between real money and other crypto.\n\nIn reality, all you can see is that Tether has \"minted\" a billion new dollars worth of USDT, and that has flowed to an exchange and has been used to buy BTC or other crypto, pushing the value of all crypto up in the process. You can't confirm their reserves because they refuse actual audits, and they just release attestations essentially saying \"trust us bro\". \n\nIf you cash out your USDT, you're doing it through a third party, and not actually getting paid by Tether directly. Nobody knows what kind of deals or transactions the exchanges are making with them, but there are reports that they take crypto in exchange for USDT, which means that their \"reserves\" will tank if the markets tank, which is when the most people would want to actually cash out, crashing everything.\n\nIt's therefore in Tether's best interests to make sure that crypto doesn't spike down, because the ponzi needs to continue. So they can just, for example print a billion dollars worth of USDT out of the blue and transfer it to an \"unknown wallet\", provide no explanation of who purchased it, provide no proof of funds in exchange for it, and then that will get used to prop up the price of crypto and it all just keeps going:\n\n[https://www.tekedia.com/tether-just-printed-one-billion-dollar-usdt/](https://www.tekedia.com/tether-just-printed-one-billion-dollar-usdt/)\n\nOf course there are now also other stable coins serving the same function, which are also not providing audited proof of reserves or disclosing any of their transactions to anyone, so it's only getting more complicated. But the long and short of it is that minting new USDT can be used to inject artificial value into crypto as a whole, without actually spending any real money, and it's not sustainable in the long term.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "True.

Saying that most ppl agreed upon value of a currency makes little to no sense in the argument against btc. It's supply and demand. If they print more it will lose value. If ppl stop buying usd for whatever reason it will lose value etc. So bitcoin is just another currency whose value is determined by supply and demand. The only difference is that it's not issued by the government (for some ppl that's bad and for some it's the main reason they buy btc) Its value is not only due to cheap transactions but it gets more complicated then. It involves politics and what many consider conspiracy theories so we better avoid that, I would probably need to change your whole perspective of the world, there's no point.
