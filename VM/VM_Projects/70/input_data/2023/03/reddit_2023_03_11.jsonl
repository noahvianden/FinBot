{"title": "How major US banks could be at risk of sweeping defaults", "selftext": "\nWith the recent implosion of SVB (Silicon Valley Bank), it's important to start looking under the rug before all of the roaches start running all over the place. In a nutshell, we know a few things have happened:\n\n1. Trillions of dollars were printed and we aren't going to escape the effects of it.\n2. Interest rates are up enough to really start killing off borrowing demand, to the tune of 20% volume of mortgage starts versus one year ago.\n3. US consumer credit debt is way up, and personal savings are way down.\n4. Treasuries are paying 4.5%+ and mortgages are up near 7%. Companies with too large of a disparity between what they pay out in corporate bonds and what they receive from risk free interest will be especially in danger, much like SVB.\n5. If you look here- [https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h8/current/default.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h8/current/default.htm) you'll find that all the major US commercial banks have about $2T in residual (assets minus liabilities), about a 10% margin over their liabilities. Assets=22T, Liabilities=20T.\n\nAll it takes to start forcing banks to sell assets is 2 trillion dollars in losses. That's it. SVB is imploding over a $15B loss and JP Morgan is rumored to have $47B in unrealized losses on their books. *EDIT: the big 4 banks are at $114B in losses as of this moment with some estimates showing $600B in total unrealized losses across the banking sector* It's not a loss til you sell, right? Consumer credit card debt alone has reached $1 trillion. Most people no longer have adjustable rate mortgages, so we can discount that one, but the commercial mortgage industry isn't so tidy. It was more or less forgotten when regulations were tightened post-2008.\n\nThe numbers as of March 1st 2023-\n\nMBS (mortgage backed securities) makes up 2.7 Trillion dollars\n\nCommercial real estate makes up 2.9T\n\nResidential makes up 2.5T\n\nThese are just a few, the link above has all the data.\n\n[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DRCCLACBS](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DRCCLACBS) shows that the credit card loan default rate has crept up to 2.25% as of Q4 2022.\n\n[https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2023/03/06/auto-loan-delinquencies-up-in-2022/11393399002/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2023/03/06/auto-loan-delinquencies-up-in-2022/11393399002/) \\---6% of all subprime auto loans are late on payments.\n\nOh, and let's not forget inflation is somewhere between 6-8% YoY, and real inflation is as high as 20% solely based on dollars printed and money devalued. AND the M2 money supply is shrinking at a rate synonymous with economic depressions. M2 has only decreased from $21.7T to $21.2T since Feb 2022, representing a $500B drop or 2.3%.\n\nAll of this is to say, for the banks to be squeezed to the tune of $2 trillion from all of the above factors isn't much. If you take away the drop in M2 money supply, you're at $1.5T. If you take away an additional 8% from their assets since Feb 2022 due to inflation, you're already in the red ($1.5T-1.76T= -.26T). Now, that might be an exaggeration or conflation of factors. But if you even start to get close to 5-8% default rates on commercial loans (which are going to be hit harder due to a drop in consumer spending)- you wipe out another $150 Billion to $232 Billion. Not to mention what happens if MBS counted as assets on the banks books start to get dumped (again). Technically, if MBS, commercial, and residential properties collectively lose 10-30% of their value, this whole thing starts to get really ugly. This can all get out of hand quickly, especially if there are people who try to pull all of their money out of the banks because as we know, fractional reserve banking means they probably don't have enough to assuage the fears of the public at large.....\n\nEven if the banks don't fully go into the red due to defaults, if they start to get close there's a good chance they'll have to start selling assets and unwinding liabilities to maintain adequate reserves per federal regulation, or risk going down completely. And once that selling starts, you better buckle up because the more of those assets that hit the market from various commercial banks, the less those assets will be worth on the open market due to supply outweighing demand.\n\nWe will more than likely end up in a situation where the Fed raises rates, attempting to execute a 'soft landing' but once the dominoes start to fall, it's very difficult to stop rolling defaults. First, consumers default on credit card loans, then home loans and auto loans, then businesses default on loans and fail to pay their leases, REIT's start to get squeezed, banks are unable to recover a large chunk of loaned out money, and all of a sudden you have banks creeping up on default, requiring a bailout from big daddy warbucks, the government. Even assets sold to recuperate borrowed money will become worth less than the loan value itself if there is too much selling at once.\n\nThe ideal play here is to be cash heavy once the selling really starts. You could try to time the market and buy some puts, but you might also get royally screwed if the party keeps going for longer than expected. The issue that stocks will find themselves in is that treasuries at 4.5% look very attractive if you're expecting a down year, which as more banks start having problems, people may very well get spooked and sell off their equities to sit in cash or treasuries/money market funds.\n\nI've moved to about 20% cash, piled some into FAZ to short the banks with leverage (not ideal due to decay, I know), and I'm piling up cash in the event that real estate becomes more attractive, because you'd be able to buy at a discount and refinance once this all cools down in 3-5 years as is historically typical. Ultimately I like my stronger stocks like AAPL, GOOG, etc. I've sold over half my NVDA stake after the recent run-up because well, 100% gains in a few months is a little much, don't you think? A good bit of my cash on hand is sitting in a fund gaining 4.5% until I decide to deploy it in the event of a massive cascading selloff.\n\nUPDATE 04/01/2023\n-Fed Reserve opened u $2T of backstop liquidity. Not saying I was right about $2T being the magic number, but pretty coincidental considering that's what St. Louis Federal Reserve site data said. \n-SVB now being absorbed by First Citizens bank, curious to see if it backfires, but FC probably believes that the fed will keep stepping in, so much for QT as the feds balance sheet shot up $400B in two weeks to bail out regional banks. \n-Made some quick money on FAZ by selling the day after the fed announced the liquidity backstop. Glad I got out immediately.  \n-The next stop on the market crash train ride will be when rates finally peak and come back down- that's historically when the market crashes. Til then, party like its 2006 yeah? \n\nUPDATE 5/3/2023\nFRC goes down, absorbed by JPM. Talk of another bank selling. Treasury talks buybacks starting in 2024. JPOW and friends hike rates another .25%, as expected but remain neutral but slightly hawkish. People are expecting them to turn dovish before too many more banks go down. Total bank collapses are now greater than 2008, at around $550 billion. Add that to the amount withdrawn from the system (M2 money supply), portfolio losses, credit and auto defaults, and we start approaching $2T in losses rather quickly.", "id": "11o5jer", "created_utc": 1678493875.0, "score": 80, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 73, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|5|**First Seen In WSB**|2 years ago\n**Total Comments**|311|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n>TL;DR: Banks are screwed, and it might be a good idea to go to cash now before things really start to unravel.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "just remember to keep your cash in the bank because its safe", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "The big fallacy in your argument is that you fail to mention that banks are not expected to mark to market their losses on bonds.
