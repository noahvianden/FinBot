{"title": "Will the death of the regional banks be the death of US economy?", "selftext": "What do you guys think? How deep can this crisis spread?\n\nThere's a ton of fear in the market and healthy banks are going down the drain. To the extreme, that would create a monopoly on the banking sector by the too big to fail banks. In that case, does it actually matter for the economy? China only has a handful of state owned banks, and they pretty much can't fail since they are backed by the printer. So maybe it's something that's solved once and for all? \n\nSince banks can only operate on a fractional reserve basis (ie they lend out 1000 dollars when they have 100 in deposits), or else we'd be paying the banks to safeguard our money. Whenever people pull out large sums of money at once, no bank can actually withstand that.\n\nWould this scenario be possible:\nDeath of small banks> feds printing money to cover insured deposits> devaluation of USD > sell off of USD for Euros > further decline of USD > inflation due to higher import fees plus the printing", "id": "11x7tbh", "created_utc": 1679376390.0, "score": 42, "upvote_ratio": 0.7, "num_comments": 67, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|3 days ago\n**Total Comments**|9|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Small banks are very important as they are not held by the same lending standards as big banks, it is easy to get a personal loan or a car loan or a small business at a small bank like a credit union than a big bank", "score": 43, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah that's what I'm thinking too.
