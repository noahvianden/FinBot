The second position I closed was my XOP Iron Condor with the expiration of 24 MAR. I closed this position around 2:30pm on FRI, 24 MAR for a profit of $70 (57%).\n* The only two new positions I opened this week were two different F CSPs; one at the $12 strike and one at the $12.50 strike. Both have the same expiration date of 28 APR. I rolled (closed) the $12.35 CSP for a net gain. The initial $43 loss was offset by the $143 credit I received for the new CSP at the $12.50 strike.\n* I look forward to closing out my bank positions in JPM, FRC, and BX in the upcoming coming weeks. I am already sitting at a max loss on my FRC spread so there’s no point in trying to close the position since I have until 14 APR. By the end of FRI it seemed the bank worries were abating despite the FRI morning news about Deutsche Bank, which is not expected to default. \n* At this time, I am not planning to open any new trades next week, but if I do, I will be trading less volatile tickers. \n* After 12 weeks I am far outpacing the S&P Index by 0.83% (per week) with an average weekly gain of 1.14% vs the S&P Index’s weekly average of 0.29%.", "id": "121lqnj", "created_utc": 1679750600.0, "score": 112, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 70, "comments": [{"body": "do you have plans to scale this eventually? while 0.75% a week is not bad return honestly and you are obviously far exceeding that and the S&P in the long run... but at current $$$ its not a livable income yet... so is that your plan test it out on this smaller scale and then scale to a bigger one to live off?", "score": 43, "replies": [{"body": "Yes that's the plan and I'm also trying to refine this strategy so that it's repeatable but that's the hardest part.

That said, be careful focusing too much on the short term 1 week results week in and week out. 30-45 DTE is my sweet spot too, it gives you more time to filter through the noise in the macro environment and for your hypothesis to be right. Hitting your weekly average over the course of a quarter or something might be better for your mental health. You could do everything right and just have things go against you for a few days and screw up your week. I had a vertical call spread on SPY a month or so ago. One week I was up to 50% profit, left it open and it moved against me for a 4 day period taking out almost all of my profit, then a week later I closed it for a 60% max profit.\n\nI've also had an ongoing \"wheel\" position in INTC for a few months now. That one's been a roller-coaster... Lol. Net green, price level where it was when I got in, but it's been so up and down in between.\n\nThe most important thing as you grow your account is learning what works for you and how things move.

Your max risk is predicated on the fact that you can exercise the long if you get assigned on the short.  If you are unable to exercise that long, then you effectively have a naked short that could be assigned and your max loss suddenly gets a lot bigger.  \n\nInteresting point as I have a spread open on FRC too.
