{"title": "On why EVs and robotaxis are not going to create multi-trillion dollar companies...", "selftext": "The EV hype is finally plateauing.\n\nThis is my articulation of what I expect to happen in this space.\n\nThe manufacturing techniques of Tesla are starting to be more widely adopted.  There are lots of other EV companies out there.  Many are going to fail in the next two or three years.  The ones that survive will be mass market.  EVs will be plentiful.\n\nIn the next decade, maybe EVs become 90+% of all new vehicles sold.  Margins will erode.  The market will look at lot like it does now, with a dozen companies that make the majority of vehicles on the road.  The names might be different ones, but the character of the market is going to be largely the same.\n\nBut, what about robotaxies and fully automated driving?  That's going to lead to massive profits, right?  Probably not.  An illustrative example, relevant to vehicles: in 2000, I bought an S500.  The nav. system was a $6,000 option, and the discs containing road data (yes, the data was on CDs that you put in a box in the trunk) were $250 a piece.  You needed 4 or 5 to cover the US.  By 2020, you would buy that same functionality for $200 (a phone) and $30/mo. for data.  *And* it gives you up to the minute traffic information to boot.  In roughly 20 years, the cost dropped by a factor of roughly 30.\n\nTesla is getting $15,000 for FSD.  Their window during which to charge this isn't going to be horribly long.  Due to the ever-increasing pace of technology advancement, that 30 factor that took 20 years before is likely to take 15 years now... maybe not even... maybe 10.\n\nIn 2033, I think you have fully automated driving for $300 additional cost (getting a car *without* the relevant hardware and software will actually be kinda difficult), and $30/mo. for data.  And that data will be necessary for a lot of reasons (up to date road information, software updates, etc., but *also* because your car is going to be talking to every other car in it's vicinity, constantly feeding each other sensor data).\n\nFurther, this technological advancement is likely to make the overall market for vehicles shrink, not grow, because who the hell wants to own a car if there's one on the corner that will pick you up 30 seconds after you request it?\n\nGradually, people's garages will be emptied of cars, and put to better use.  Like, for beer making equipment.\n\nAnd you'll be subscribed to a new fangled \"livery service\" that you'll pay $x/mo. to be a member of, and maybe $y/mile.  The charges let the livery service company go out and acquire vehicles and maintain them.  They'll be very spartan.  Because no one wants to be cleaning barf off upholstery all the time, because these get used to get back from the bar.  But, you won't care, because cars are a massive hassle, and the few times a year you need one to go to the mountains, or take a road trip to Matamoros, you'll just rent one.\n\nAnyways.  My thoughts.  If you're looking for a multi-trillion opportunity, it's going to have to be much more than EVs and robotaxis.  And insurance.  And batteries.  And especially \"fully automated driving\".\n\nSomeone needs to sit Cathy Woods down and explain to her how software  technology inexorably becomes very close to free.

{"title": "Day two of JPOW: chopped up… All eyes on Jobless Claims Tomorrow… 3-8-23 SPY/ ES Futures, VIX, DXY and 10YR Yield Daily Market Analysis", "selftext": "Well this has to have been one of the most frustrating days I have traded in a long time. Absolutely zero follow through and some absolutely erratic candle movements chopped me up today. Lets take a look at where the dust has settled… \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kboe7u8aclma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=a8d16481184b2332d21e5311ab865db3ca0c708f\n\nAll eyes are officially on jobless claims tomorrow… why is jobless claims tomorrow important? JPOW the last two days has basically re-iterated and other fed talking points have continued to say that we are data dependent and even going into next FOMC we are data dependent. As you cans see by this chart here that we have been trending down on jobless claims (as in there are less and less people saying they are jobless) since December 11th and around the first week of February we “bottomed.” \n\nThe last 3 jobs claims has been higher than previous… why does this matter? Because if job claims are rising now then that would indicate the economy is “weakening” which then means the feds rate hikes are working. The biggest concern for the fed is that despite what they do the economy as it has since summer continues to ramp up. \n\nThis number is projected at 195k tomorrow which would mean a 4th week in a row that claims rise (economy weakening) and that would be extremely bullishly received. However, if that number comes in below 193k again tomorrow that could signal jobs trending back down and the fears of a 50bps grow…\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3zrqvvwaclma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=6dc19b7dd031fb2ca33ebee622721d1eccbb869e\n\nAs of now… we have a 77.9% priced in chance (expectation) of a 50bps at the march 22nd meeting which I absolutely find incredible. This is where im at…   \n \n\nmarkets gonna market until CPI -> CPI is going to come in better than expected (aka bullishly received) -> algos are gonna pick up on that and dump the chances of a 50bps to 0% that day… -> massive rally into FOMC -> FOMC becomes the top when the dot plot and fed funds rate projections come out terribly hot and unexpected. \n\nI don’t think we actually get a 50bps… unless we get a true CPI YoY/ MoM rebound which I don’t forsee, however, I am waiting for the consensus to come out this week still. \n\n**SPY SUPPLY/ DEMAND**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gy2z0ahbclma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=e9b94e5115f05ed83148ef130d5a0b585c28340c\n\nToday the daily chart came down and touched the 396.54 supply. Now this came within 4 cents on the daily time frame which on a daily time frame is within the room of error. However, this is a key level to keep in mind if we reject the downside. With the current technical on SPY we are actually looking to establish a new demand (support) at this 398.2 range. If we were to put in a green day tomorrow, especially if we could see a close over 401.5 there is a solid chance that today and yesterdays lows establish a new demand (support) at 398.2…. a demand being established over previous demand at 394.68 would be extremely bullish and I would once again start thinking about a push back to the upper range resistance of 405.17. \n\nSpy very well leading into CPI next week could find itself stuck between a 398 and 405 choppy range. \n\n**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yh1c6k1cclma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=b0958098077ca08071d33494d82b4c7ebe2d2684\n\nFrom a daily price action stand point we have reached a bounce point. This pattern actually is playing out beautifully. If you go back to Thursday we started a three day $12+ pump. It was natural to expect that to result in a retrace to back fill some of these levels. Now that we have back filled the actual daily gap and came down to find support on the daily 100ema… with this morning doji start pattern we should expect a push back to 402 tomorrow minimally. That would put us back at a retest of the daily 20ema. \n\nNow that’s from strictly a technical standpoint… IF jobs come in low and algos dump us then I would start targeting 394.6 demand area for a potential bounce. \n\nWe have found ourselves exactly where we were on Monday. From a technical/ price action and even supply/ demand stand point this is 100% a call opportunity and I 100% expect upside… however, much like Monday we had a major catalyst that can negate the technical temporarily or can support the technical much like Tuesday did. \n\nSPY Levels:\n\nSupply- 405.17 -> 414.13   \n Demand- 394.68 -> 388.52  \n Daily support- 398.4 -> 396.4 -> 394.6 -> 392.6  \n Daily Resistance- 399.6 -> 401.5 -> 404.5\n\n**FUTURES SUPPLY AND DEMAND**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bjygdtmcclma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=9df97d9a8d2405a995766fe513035d937ed2a8e8\n\nTaking a look at futures supply and demand we have found ourselves in “no mans land.” We are under the recently established 4055 supply and we are just over the 3960 demand (support) below us. Looking at the technical if we were to have another bullish day tomorrow we could be attempting to establish todays low of 3990 as a new demand (support). That would much like SPYS daily S/D be very bullish. With the demands (supports) stacked like that from 3920 to potentially 3990 (this would also turn previous supply of 3990 into a new demand) that is very bullish. I would then look for a push back to 4055 and potentially even attempt to take out demand at 4096 if we got a big enough bounce. \n\n**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vykt6q3dclma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=d473c67b29eef9df878dd545414f881970fcb7b3\n\nFrom a daily price action stand point on futures is much of the same with this classic morning doji star/ double bottom off 3990 support today. This on futures is also a retest and support holding for the 100ema. \n\nWith this price action (again dependent on data…) we should see a push to the upside tomorrow. My ultimate futures target is 4020 which would give us a close back over the daily 8, 50 and 200ema and ultimately would make me expect a rally back to the 4053 supply and possibly even as high as 4095 on Friday depending on data. \n\nHowever, in the chance that data is negatively received my ultimate downside target is a support test of 3920. This should be a major support test and as long as that holds then ultimately we should expect a push back to the 4000s. However, a closure under 3920 would be extremely bearish and could very well start a further sell off. \n\nFutures Levels:\n\nSupply: 4055 -> 4160  \n Demand: 3920 -> 3960 -> 4096  \n Daily Support- 3990 -> 3955  \n Daily Resistance- 4020 -> 4055 -> 4085\n\n**VIX**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cph6ti5eclma1.png?width=629&format=png&auto=webp&s=2914dc51b995342d4dd62ff9ab7d43147f12dd26\n\nThe VIX is actually in an interesting place. I also mentioned yesterday that I was surprise with the fact that a 50bps is now nearly 70%+ “priced in” that the VIX did not break through 19.7. That is very odd if you ask me… now granted markets have absolutely been focusing on the use of 0dte options instead of longer DTE… but if markets truly “believed” that we were going to get 50bps, and that cpi would be red hot we would be seeing a much longer and more importantly sustained spike on the VIX. However, today we are seeing yet again the VIX unwind. \n\nThe VIX remains at that 19.7 resistance at in a bear flag breakdown pattern that should lead once again to another drop to that 18.3 support rea. \n\n**DXY**\n\nNow im going to start this with a disclaimer… I generally have watched the DXY and 10yr yield since probably mid summer time. However, I have never once taken a trade solely based off it. I do enjoy watching in general dollar/ yield up = spy SHOULD be down… now many of you know that does not always happen. Yields/ DXY have been moving in tandem with SPY which is interesting. Some are even saying that yields have finally gone too far… however, long story short im going to start watching DXY more closely and see if we can see anything. Merely going to talk out loud and see if there is any bigger correlations we can catch. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z9q54dcfclma1.png?width=615&format=png&auto=webp&s=56425814eeb0641349deb5e98590477392e8dd23\n\nFrom a price action stand point DXY is in an overall massive rising wedge that dates back to January/ February. As of now price remains over its daily 8ema and had officially closed over the 105.6 level which was the high back form December. \n\nJust for reference at this time period when DXY was at 105.6 area in beginning of December SPY was at trading in the 380s range (this was directly post December CPI). This means we are about 4.7% higher on SPY now than we were back then. \n\nCurrent trend would allow for DXY to fall as low as 104.7 by Monday (day before CPI) and rise as high as 106.4. \n\n**10YR YIELD**\n\nI am starting with the same disclaimer here that I am merely watching the 10yr like this in order to see if we catch anything to help us. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3kuzyfhgclma1.png?width=617&format=png&auto=webp&s=c598651e7df702a69ad4188fabf7f6f2e58a48e9\n\nThe 10yr is in this same rising wedge pattern as DXY. Which I actually find interesting as SPY daily is in a breakout triangle pattern which I full expect it to hold within leading into CPI. This rising wedge on DXY/ 10yr COULD be the hint that we actually see a breakout to the upside on SPY which also supports my thesis on a bullishly received CPI. \n\nCurrently the 10yr is sitting just under 4% after briefly breaching it today. For reference on the 10yr the last time it was this high was back in November. At which time SPY held that 395 to 405 range leading into CPI before it saw the bigger dump. In that sense we are actually spot on with where we should be here… \n\nFrom a TA stand point we actually have a pretty nice but ugly head and shoulders or W pattern formed here with our lows at that 3.4% area and highs here at the 4% area… that would indicate that the 10yr will sell off and that would lead to a pump on SPY… \n\nOverall from a macro stand point 10yr and DXY suggest we are in a place where they are likely to retrace which might be support by jobs data and CPI and that could lead to a rally on SPY. \n\n**DAILY TRADING LOG**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dov27gxgclma1.png?width=767&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d7a49cf9f2203047d98aca65938df567a6368f8\n\nI got pretty chopped up today and some how managed to put in a decently small red day and still have a pretty nice green week. I recognized early on today that morning range and chop. I took the first opportunity for a call when we broke out over 399 and closed there this morning and was immediately stopped out. With the massive wicks on the 15min chart I once again waited for the breakout and when we broke out around 1145 and closed a new HOD I once again was immediately stopped out. \n\nI still looking back have no good reason or data to support why from 12 until 130pm we went on that massive dump from HOD to LOD like that. It really was fully against the technical at the time.\n\nBest play of the day was the 14dte calls I took near the 3971 support are on futures (a major weekly support). That rogue EOD pump printed calls nicely and turned what was going to be a pretty sour day into just an annoying day. \n\nFrustrating to feel like I was behind and buying the top/ bottom on every play. However, I will say that I followed my rules and almost every play I took everything I look for in an entry (especially the first 3 calls I stopped out of) were all 100% signaled.. as in I have everything I look for with a perfect call entry. I wont let one day change my strategy as its tried and true… after a successful day yesterday with the volatility today was a humbling reminder that FED days do not generally fit into my ideal trading strategy. \n\nAt the end of the day though tomorrows a new day and there will always be a new day… we have to at time know when to walk away and know when the day just isn’t going to give us what we need.", "id": "11ma6zv", "created_utc": 1678314269.0, "score": 88, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 76, "comments": [{"body": "That Fed Funds futures graph is insane.

The long end is affected both by what the Fed is doing with interest rates, as well as the outlook for economic growth. On the other hand, the short end of the curve, like the 2yr note, is almost exclusively dictated by what the Fed will be doing with interest rates in the short term. \n\nSo the reason we have an inverted yield curve (2Y yield is higher than the 10Y) is because the market knows that what the Fed is doing with interest rates in the short term is going to slow the growth of the economy in the long term.\n\nThis is in keeping with the fact that longer-dated treasuries are considered a safe haven in times of uncertainty or low economic growth. If we were in a typical healthy economy and all of a sudden the yield on 10yr and 30yr treasuries started dropping because people were buying them up, that would be a bad sign for the economy and stocks would probably go down (most likely investors would be selling stocks and rotating into the bond market at the same time). \n\nBut since we’re in this situation where high interest rates from the Fed are the main source of pain for the stock market, you’re right, stocks should go up if the 10Y goes down. At least for a little while.
