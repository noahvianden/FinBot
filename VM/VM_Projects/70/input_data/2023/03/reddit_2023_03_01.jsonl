{"title": "Tesla and TSLA", "selftext": "I have written about TSLA before. They are in a very strong position. The only thing holding TSLA back is that Elon has apparently gone insane.\n\nTesla is still the strongest EV maker by far. They are sold out for months and months depending on the model and market. Their energy division grows in the background, and nobody notices. Other EV makers talk big, but do not have the battery supply chains. They can't make enough EVs to matter.\n\n(See Back Ground posts below. For some reason, Reddit won't let me post the links. )\n\nWhat really matters is the PE ratio and growth. I have written about this before in the above posts. Right now, it is about 57. Which really isn't that high for a company that is doing such huge growth. They made 1.3 million vehicles in 2022. But they are already as of now, at a production rate of 1.7million vehicles. By the end of 2023, it will be even higher. A company doing a 35% to 40% YoY growth rate is not at all high to have a 57 PE ratio.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Edit: Here is the TLDR,**\n\n**6 million cars per year leads to a $2.1 Trillion Market Cap with a very reasonable PE ratio.** \n\n**---6million cars per year x margin of $12K per car = 72Billion.** \n\n**---72B x reasonable PE ratio of 30 = $ 2.1Trllion**\n\n**This ignores supercharger fees, robotaxi nonsense, energy sector, solar, subscriptions, etc**\n\n**(They already have very good margins on their cars. Reuters says $15K per car already)**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFrom a Post in 2021\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTesla Stock still has huge growth potential.\n\nListen up fellow apes. I will try to make this short and simple. I believe TSLA is headed towards a $2T Market Cap.\n\n**PE Ratio**\n\nThe PE Ratio measures current share price relative to its per-share earnings. This reflects how much an investor is willing to pay for earnings.\n\nFor a company not rapidly expanding, a normal P/E ratio is around 20:1. The average PE for the S&P is something like 15.\n\nWe have all read about TSLA having an insanely high PE ratio in the past. That was before they started making over $1B per quarter.\n\nNow the PE ratio is lower, but still very high.\n\nTSLA is currently around a PE of 112 for forward earnings. The stock costs \\~$650 per share. And the earnings per share were $1.45 for Q2.\n\nSo 650/ (1.45 x 4 quarters) = A forward PE of about 110.\n\n(I am multiplying by the most recent Q2 and assuming the earnings are the same going forward for the sake of simplicity in this example)\n\nAnother way is to take annual earnings and the total market cap of the company. Their recent earnings were about $1.14B in Q2. So assume $4.56Billion for the next year.\n\n$622B market cap / 4.56B annual earnings = PE ratio of \\~135\n\nThis is with them making around 200,000 vehicles per quarter in Q2 2020. Or an annualized rate of just over 800,00 vehicles per year. Just doing an average of 1.14Billion / 200,000 gives us about $5,000 \"per car\". This ignores the energy sectors and software, solar, etc. Just a point of reference for an average.\n\n**Future**\n\nDoes anyone expect Tesla to be standing still for the next few years?\n\nOf course not.\n\nWith Berlin and Texas coming online, Tesla may reach 900,000 cars this year. In 2022 they will likely be well over 1.5million cars per year. So let's assume that by 2024 they are making 3 million cars per year.\n\n3,000,000 cars x $5,000 per car = $15Billion per year in earnings.\n\nHow about with $8,000 per car?\n\n=$24Billion\n\n$24Billion x 30 = $720Billion Market Cap\n\nHow about a PE ration of 50. Since this seems like something investors have had no trouble tolerating over the life of TSLA's stock.\n\n$24B x 50 = $1.2T Market Cap.\n\nLet's try that again for 2028\n\nAssume 6million cars per year and profits of $12,000 per car as efficiencies ramp up across all sectors.\n\nThis gives an annual earnings of $72B.\n\n((-Again, this sort of ignores the energy sector, software potential, etc.\n\n\\-Just the $10/month that Tesla charges for premium connectivity will become a high margin revenue generator. Around 2023 or 2024 Tesla will have about 5million cars on the road being charged the monthly cost.\n\n$120/year x 5,000,000 cars = $600,000,000 per year in mostly profit.\n\n\\-The Supercharger costs to other Automakers could also become a huge revenue generator. ))\n\n**A PE ratio of 30 on $72B is $2.1T**\n\nThis would be a stock price around $2200 per share.\n\nIf Investors are willing to tolerate a higher PE, then the Market Cap could hit 2T much sooner.\n\n**Other Notes**\n\nIt is worth considering that if the stock gets into the Low $1,000s, Tesla may split it again. When it was announced last time there was a massive increase in the stock price before the split. It went from the low 1,000s to the mid $2,000s. The Mid $2,000s would be a Market Carp \\~ $2T.\n\nEdit: No matter what you think about 'FSD', it should be easy for everyone to accept that once Tesla gets FSD approved in a single jurisdiction, the stock will also jump through the roof. It doesn't matter if it will be in 2022, 2023, or 20XX, etc. I left that out since it is a whole separate discussion. And is not needed for my math of a $2T market cap.\n\nDon't listen to me. Ignore my assumptions. Invest in Banana futures.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nAnother Older Post\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nGreetings fellow simians and proto-simians,\n\nI wrote a post a while back that got some interest about being long TSLA.\n\nI won't rehash the $2T market cap position. This post will go over various points of Tesla's advantages or disadvantages in support of a $2T market cap and overall value as a company and stock. HODL until 2024, stock price or year.\n\nThis may come across as the rantings of a mad-man. But I will try to make it coherent.\n\nNotes:\n\n1. All this will be done without a realization of FSD. That will have a huge change on stock price as soon as it is approved in a single jurisdiction.\n2. Also, Please note, that once TSLA gets into the low thousands, another Stock Split is likely. Last time a stock split was announced the price went from the low $1,000s to the low $2,000s by the time of the Split.\n\n**Tesla Advantages**\n\nA) Tesla has more battery supply contracts.No other company can come close to Tesla on quantity or KWHr/$ cost for battery packs.(VW has substantial contracts. But even then, it seems unlikely their vendors will be able to actually obtain enough raw material supply.)For Example, the moron Executives at Ford did not even realize that the EV Battery Supply for the world was already contracted out for Years.\n\nB) Software/Over the Air........In 2021, not even VW can figure this out.\n\nC) Software based UI\n\nLess buttons, cables, supply chain.The cost is in the supply chain.People think the minimalist interior of the 3 and Y are driven by Elon's ego. But really, the less stuff = less costs. Less install, less holding and supply costs, less wires, etc etc.The lack of traditional air vents might look cool, but it is really about having less parts.\n\nD) Supercharger Network.Tesla has the largest charging network in the World. This is a huge revenue generator and asset for Tesla Owners.\n\nE) Tesla Sells more EVs in North America/US than all the other OEMs put together...... x 4.[https://www.futurecar.com/4102/Tesla-Vehicles-Made-Up-80-of-all-EV-Sales-in-the-First-Half-of-2020](https://www.futurecar.com/4102/Tesla-Vehicles-Made-Up-80-of-all-EV-Sales-in-the-First-Half-of-2020)\n\nF) If you count road trip capable EVs, (can charge fast enough) Tesla sells over 90%.The crappy leafs and bolt type EVs cannot charge fast enough for a road trip.\n\nG) People hate car dealerships more than the Dentist for a lot of reasons. People like buying things online and not having to interact with other humans. Besides just being able to order online, with a Tesla, you can see the actual price of the actual car. That is the price. It is nearly impossible to get an actual out-the-door price from a legacy dealer until the final paperwork for the car.As consumers become more and more aware of this, it will be a sales advantage for Tesla.\n\nH) The potential EV market is huge.\n\nEvery Dinosaur OEM is always stunned when their EV offerings sell out in minutes. People want EVs. Tesla is not really competing against other EVs. They are taking sales of dinosaur ICE sales.\n\nG) Tesla Engineers in different areas work together. In a normal OEM world, the radiator team does not work with the regen-break team. Tesla staff do work together. So there is less bulk and unneeded parts in Tesla products.\n\nH) The \"Model 2\" is likely to be announced soon. This is the cheaper compact EV expected to be made and marketed in China.\n\nI) All Teslas are capable of Road Trips.(Big Enough Battery, Efficient enough Mileage, Fast Enough Charge Rate miles per minutes charging). Not to mention robust enough charging network.\n\nJ). Right now, it is very difficult in the lower 48 to be more than 75 miles from a Tesla Supercharger. It is also very difficult to be on an expressway and be more than 50miles from a Supercharger. This is a huge asset and Tesla is already there now. Not in a few years.[https://supercharge.info/map](https://supercharge.info/map)\n\nK) Seamless Supercharging.Have you ever used a non-Tesla fast charger? The process is awful. The stalls might be broken, they don't handshake with the car, the payment doesn't work etc. They are in shopping parking lots instead of along major travel routes.\n\n**Disadvantages**\n\nA) Non-FSD chip Supply(Shouldn't affect Tesla more than any other OEM. But may have more airtime in the media due to FUD spreaders)\n\nB) FUD in the media. Example: Jalopnik has a huge audience. But they can't print an accurate story about Tesla if their lives depended on it. Reading the Jalopnik comments on a Tesla Story is like listening to conspiracy rants from the Capitol Rioters. Tesla gets them clicks. Printing something sensational gets clicks. Here is an example. Many outlets, including Jalopnik, recently reported that Tesla finally made a profit without Reg Credits (pollution emission credits). Except that Tesla has made a profit in the past without Reg Credits. It is hard to believe someone writing an article could be this bad at math and research. Taxes are paid on income from Reg Credits. So you have to subtract both the income AND the taxes on that income if you want to know Tesla's Quarterly balance sheet without Reg Credits. \\*\\* Math Below\n\n**Other OEMs are mostly Morons**\n\nA) Ford has paired with SK to make a factory that can make 125GWHrs per year.....in 2025.This is a decent amount of battery supply. But again, this is really only enough Batteries for <2 million cars annually...by 2025. And this is if they can even get the supply contracts for raw materials. Tesla Will be making 2 Million electric cars per year by the middle of 2023 if not sooner.\n\nB) Most other electric cars in North America are still compliance nonsense like the Bolts.\n\nB1) The Bolts are really just there to sell Silverados. The Bolts can't fast charge enough for a road trip. The Bolts catch fire and have recalls that aren't reported much in the news. Could you imagine if Tesla told people to stop charging their vehicles indoors or unattended? There would be articles calling for Blood.\n\nB2) The MachE is a good car spec wise. (It really is a compliance car for the EU though)But was clearly designed by a company that is Silo'd. Meaning the engineering groups do not work together. Sandy Munro - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1dQtlrI7uU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1dQtlrI7uU)\n\nB3) There are only a handful of non-Tesla electric cars in North America in models and total quantity that can actually charge fast enough for non-local driving. Most of these are pricey. It is Q3 2021. Selling an EV that can only charge at 150KW peak charge rate is a joke. Even the ID4 is more like 125KW.\n\nC) GM appears to be MoronsThese people paired with Nikola. How dumb could a company be?Anyone who follows the EV space knew that Nikola was vaporware long before the latest fraud accusations.\n\n[https://hindenburgresearch.com/nikola/](https://hindenburgresearch.com/nikola/)\n\nD) Tesla is sold out for Months. (2022 forfor some)This is a great problem to have in most circumstances. If you want a Tesla in 2021, you should be ordering it now.\n\nE) There are something like 1.2 million Cybertruck reservations.\n\nEven if only half of those turn into actual orders, that is still $40 Billion in revenue.\n\nPresumably more and more orders will come in once deliveries start being made and people see them in person.[https://www.fr24news.com/a/2021/08/tesla-cybertruck-orders-exceed-1-2-million-units.html](https://www.fr24news.com/a/2021/08/tesla-cybertruck-orders-exceed-1-2-million-units.html)\n\nFor comparison, the F150 lighting has about 150,000 reservations/orders. Which is great. Except that Ford has no battery supply to deliver most of these for the next several years.\n\nF. Toyota is still Gaslighting us about Hydrogen.\n\n[https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/07/toyota-bet-wrong-on-evs-so-now-its-lobbying-to-slow-the-transition/](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/07/toyota-bet-wrong-on-evs-so-now-its-lobbying-to-slow-the-transition/)\n\nG. People think a common parts bin is an asset. It mostly is not. If you are designing common EVs, then yes sure, a common parts bin makes sense. But what it really has done to most offerings from Dinosaur OEMs has forced decisions that were based on the part; not the design need. See Sandy Munro videos for examples. But the MachE is a good example.\n\n**Ranting about Hydrogen Fuel Cells**\n\nZZ) Hydrogen is for snake oil for Gaslighting morons. Most people think that Hydrogen is burned in Fuel cells cars. HFCs actually work like this: You put a bunch of energy into making, storing, and transporting hydrogen, then later, you get a small small amount of that energy back. Each KG of Hydrogen created will produce about 9KG of C02. (before accounting for storage and transport)[https://www.forbes.com/sites/rrapier/2020/06/06/estimating-the-carbon-footprint-of-hydrogen-production/](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rrapier/2020/06/06/estimating-the-carbon-footprint-of-hydrogen-production/)\n\n\\*\\* TSLA Q3 2020 Example\n\n[https://cleantechnica.com/2020/10/25/tesla-bears-prove-easy-q3-math-is-hard/](https://cleantechnica.com/2020/10/25/tesla-bears-prove-easy-q3-math-is-hard/)\n\nPeople who spread that myth are not recognizing that taxes are paid on reg credit income.Reg credits have taxes paid on them.\n\nLess Income = Less Taxes.Income from Reg Credits is taxed.\n\n555 income before taxes186 paid in taxes= about 34% tax rate\n\nIf people claim that they only made a profit from regulatory credits, then subtract out regulatory credits AND the taxes paid on them.555 - 397= \\~158\n\n158 \\* tax rate of 34% or so = 53milli in taxes\n\n158-53mil in taxes = over 100mil in profit.\n\nThe point being they have made a profit in previous quarters without reg credits.
