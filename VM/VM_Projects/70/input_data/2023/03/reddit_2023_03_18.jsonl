{"title": "Can the Fed really dare not raise rates next week? Who would have thought that gold could rise 6% in a week?", "selftext": "2023-03-17\n\n&#x200B;\n\nU.S. stocks:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nU.S. stocks pulled back today, with all three major indexes in the red, with the SPX and Dow both down more than 1% and the Nasdaq off 0.5%. Today, the banking crisis has not passed, the US banking sector still plunged, FRCS fell nearly 30%, the Federal Reserve since the weekend decided to rescue SVB depositors, the balance sheet expanded by nearly 300 billion dollars in just a few days, which is almost equivalent to the shrinking of the balance sheet since last November has been wasted, such a speed of balance sheet expansion, This is almost the beginning of a new round of QE. Next week will be interesting. Maybe the Fed will still raise rates, but I don't know what POWELL will say about reducing the balance sheet. I can just imagine POWELL stammering, just like YELLEN did when she was asked to bail out the big banks these days. At best, the Fed may be learning what to do after the central bank's emergency bout of QE to save pensions. The financial sector is taking the market down today. All three indexes are down, but the weekly chart shows that they are not really in the same country. The Dow was down slightly this week, the SPX was up slightly, and the Nasdaq was up more than 5%.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy is Nasdaq skyrocketing? Because even though the Fed didn't cut rates or stop raising rates, they've started to expand the balance sheet, they've started to inject liquidity into the market, which is exactly what the market likes to see, as long as there is money to drive up stock prices? So the growth tech stocks that were the worst performers last year are starting to strengthen. However, I still have great doubts about the recent strength of the stock market. Even if the central bank releases liquidity, it can solve the liquidity risk of some banks for a short time, but in the long run, it will stimulate higher inflation. The Federal Reserve will certainly not allow the price to be unstable, and then it will have to raise interest rates more sharply. And will the Fed dare not raise rates next week? I also analyzed yesterday that the Fed is going to have its PEER GROUP PRESSURE, at least in this case, not so sure. If the Fed talks tough next week about fighting inflation, the stock market will have to go from where it came from. The fundamentals of the U.S. economy are pretty bad, and I don't see any effective solutions for them right now. Keep thinking short term in the current financial markets.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9w99jq4qceoa1.jpg?width=865&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=69eca35725db949d47162b5e4f546bca85f73f7b\n\n \n\nUs dollar:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe dollar continues to fall, and its previous rally has given the impression of weakness. America is much like the 1970s, when the economy faltered, it put the brakes on inflation, and then, again and again, stagflation. Now it is highly likely that the U.S. economy will follow the same path, and the credibility of the dollar will be eroded in the back-and-forth of the Federal Reserve's policies, not to mention that China is looking at the side, not only to dollarize themselves, but also to pull a group of brothers to dismantle the dollar, and maybe even to the stage of wall down. In the long run, I do not believe that the existing dollar system can be so reckless as to cut leeks, out of the mix always want to return.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tcg1de1rceoa1.jpg?width=803&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4ca95f2377ef0778451e56f8155acd1f6ac4a8d9\n\nGold:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWho would have thought that gold could rise 6% in a week? But the Fed is letting loose, the banking system is in trouble, the US may be stuck in a prolonged period of stagflation, China is publicly selling Treasuries and hoarding gold. All of these are great for gold. The surge in gold this week is very much like a technical breakthrough on the weekly chart. Or is it a false break and a return to the previous descent channel? The GLD180 position is an important point to watch. In addition, the strong gold producers have underperformed compared to gold, with gold less than 5% away from its all-time high and GDXJ 70% away from its August 2020 high. If the market develops a consensus for a long-term gold rally, gold stocks have room to run.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jokr2dwrceoa1.jpg?width=793&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=23013dfa4ab22921a79e06c711f4db9a3dd21876\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat's all for today's analysis.
