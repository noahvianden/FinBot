Hell that's googles entire business model, providing an audience.  \n  \nMarketing is massive, which is why meta is good, because the other social media platforms pay all the money to build the audience but have no real effective wab to monetize the monetization of that audience. Both FB and Instagram are well positioned, FB because it's easy for local business to advertise to local people, and Instagram because it's easy for businesses to advertise to interests or areas.  \n \nSo you, as a business, can effectively advertise via those mediums and see decent returns on your money vs paying, say google, and hooing people are searching for you.  \n \nTiktok is easily monetized by influencers who have a large audience via the app.. but like vine before it, it struggles to find an effective way to monetize it's platform.

They never were. They have always stolen other people's ideas after the other people did all the hard work.

Obviously Pinterest isn't making huge amounts of money, that's not the point though.. if they found a way to combine social media in general with product advertising like on Pinterest in a not overly intrusive way then all the data they collect and advertising they sell would be in-house more and less suceptible to outside forces like apples privacy settings on their phone (because apple wants to be the one making money off you not meta or google). They need to not just be the middleman and the billboard, but provide a platform that bridges that last gap. Marketplace kind of starts that but it really isn't all the way there yet.. I feel like they have a LOT of room tk expand in that direction still and in doing so they would make their data and advertising much move valuable.\n \nBut that's just me.", "score": 6, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Nobody buys shit advertised on FB, unless it‚Äôs some pro gun tshirts or MLM garbage", "score": -4, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "When India banned TikTok, Instagram Reels became the main replacement.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I hope TikTok does not get banned.
