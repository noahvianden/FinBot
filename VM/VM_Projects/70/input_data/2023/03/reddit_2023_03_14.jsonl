{"title": "Is our economy going to 💩?", "selftext": "There’s currently 2 outcomes for the feds rate hikes next week, either they go up or they don’t. Either way though, I think our economy is doomed and here’s why:\n\nOption 1: Rates stay the same. \n\nWhy this could go good:\nMaybe inflation isn’t as we thought and we all live happily ever after. We shall see on Tuesday.\n\nWhy this could go bad: \nThroughout history, our government has overspent way too much, and it’s only been getting worse. I feel like Covid was the cherry on top for inflation. If the fed were to ignore inflation it could get out of hand.\n\nOption 2: Rates go up\n\nWhy this could go good: Inflation will be tamed, down and hopefully no more banks will get exposed.\n\nWhy this could go bad: The banking problem could be only the tip of the iceberg, and many more small banks could collapse. The FDIC/government would have to bail out even more banks, pouring more money into the economy, increasing inflation, and sending us into another depression. \n\nI’m curious if the government would consider removing the fdic if it meant keeping the value of the dollar.", "id": "11qtecz", "created_utc": 1678759251.0, "score": 71, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 78, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|3|**First Seen In WSB**|2 months ago\n**Total Comments**|46|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|2 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n>TL;DR: In Option 1, rates stay the same and we have a chance of happy ever after.

We have had massive government spending for years with only 2% inflation. What changed was the massive transfer of Trillions of dollars to the wealth class during Covid flooding the markets with money driving up asset prices such as the stock market, and resulted in billions of dollars of investor money flooding into the housing market making homes and rents unaffordable for young families. So during Covid we all heard about $800 billion to workers and families, and $2.3 Trillion to businesses (ownership class). But we don’t hear much about the $4 TRILLION added to the Fed balance sheet through Quantitative Easing part deux, or as I like to call it, trickle down economics on steroids. QE II took a crashing stock market and pumped it full of money turning it into a record bull market entering bubble territory. Billionaires such as Bill Gates, Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos saw their wealth double (thanks Jerome Powell). The flood of investor money was soon put to work buying up US housing driving up prices and making homes unaffordable for young families (sorry poors). When the Fed during the top of the bubble said it might be time for some QT, the investor class said the sky would fall. So QT was slow walked at a measly 1% of the Fed balance sheet per month. As inflation got out of control, instead of upsetting the billionaire class and accelerating QT, the Fed sold the public a bill of goods that the only way to fight inflation was to quickly raise interest rates and put at least 2 million people out of work, disproportionately impacting the debtor class (middle class and poors) while barely mentioning QE/QT and its impact on inflation. Another note re QT, as we have seen during the last week, a recently (again) deregulated banking industry has had too poor risk management by trying to juice returns such that the Fed doing any significant QT could put the teetering banking industry at risk. Quel surprise. If anything we are more likely to see additional QE.
