Hard to say.\n\nYou could have just said that you don't know who the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists are, because they're not \"American libertarian types who are always proclaiming the sky is falling.\"\n\nI don't think you get my point. It's not that nuclear war is imminent, it's that psychologically the factors people largely consider as negative effects from the war commonly range up to nuclear war, and that concerns about rising geo-political tensions to that extent are already largely baked in.\n\nIn order to have a major market decline in the negative range, you have to have a negative surprise.

While tensions regarding USD hegemony and the BRICS bloc have been building since the 2008 financial crisis, this is the first real military conflict. \n\nUSD hegemony continuing = strong USD, strong FIRE sector, reduced exports, and continued massive imbalance of payments.  Imports would be cheap until the next conflict.  Bearish on domestic industry like Tesla, bullish on banks.  \n\nUSD hegemony ending = weak USD, decimated FIRE sector, increasingly strong export sector, shrinking imbalance of payments.  Imports would be increasingly expensive until domestic industry meets demand.  Bearish on banks, bullish on domestic industry like Tesla.  \n\nThe problem with the US economy is that it is highly bifurcated between these two factions.  I don't think we can say for certain the future is simply bullish or bearish in the traditional sense going back to 1971 with the US suspension of the Bretton Woods System.  Both competing factions have strong interests in one outcome versus the other.  \n\nAnd so do we as investors. \n\nNow, if even a low-yield nuclear weapon is detonated, I expect panic on the street...

I don't particularly care who your uncle was or your personal opinion on the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists.

Your response was not a retort to that and your semi-illiterate chest-beating is silly. I'm calling it that because your argument at the start was that the market should go down because of the \\*current\\* state of war with Ukraine... not because of some theory about imports/exports in the future relating to the gold standard. That's, as I keep saying and you keep ignoring, a future uncertain state of affairs... we're not talking about that, we're talking about you putting a directional bet into the market on the basis of something everyone is already aware of as if they aren't.
