You know, the kind we wrote the shit out of over the last 3 years?  Every bank is stuffed to the gills with them, so virtually every bank is technically insolvent if you look at what those loans would sell for today.  I think this is why the big banks truly want to keep FRC from being put up for sale officially - if we have price discovery on a more traditional portfolio of fixed income contracts (not like SVB) then you're going to have a realization that the \"net owners equity\" is actually negative for every bank because the assets are impaired so much.  They're all effectively bankrupt.  \n\nIf you think this doesn't matter, then I ask if you'd rather have a bank with all cash today ready to be lent at 7% or would you rather have a bank with no cash to be lent because its all tied up at 2.5%?  It matters because the former is going to eat the latters lunch for as long as rates are high.  Depositor flight is just an exacerbating problem.  \n\n\"Bailing out\" will either continue to happen from the big banks to the littles to try to stave off that price discovery.  Should that fail then I think the FDIC ramps up the absorption process of banks, big time.  There won't be any bailouts of the shareholders and bond holders from the government (until the problems get to the GSIBs and SIFIs - that was a huge point of contention even in '08 and wasn't pushed through until the 13th hour).  They simply won't bail out equity holders of a regional bank - mostly because it will be argued unconstitutional if the 'whole system' didn't depend on it's 'saving'.  But it also happens to be politically poisonous.  And it also happens to be creating moral hazard.  And it also happens to be inflationary.  Shareholders are Fuc'd (Bondholders too, don't think I forgot about you guys!).\n\nTo save credibility and to not cement an expectation of hyper inflation, the Fed is going to continue to raise rates.  Yes this sounds absurd given what I said above, but they simply have to.  The way in which this is different than 2018, 2008, and 2001 is that we have secular inflation that everyone notices and feels.  In a couple of years ChatGPT and other inventions that come out of low-interest-rate-moon-shots will create enough efficiencies that we'll have the next major cyclical flattening of the labor force, but that will take a little while yet to come to fruition, and in the meantime we're just, plain, short on people.  \n\nThe short term fix for this labor shortage is to make those companies that were supposed to go bankrupt years ago, go bankrupt.  Easy Money out, balance sheet health in.  Anything Junk status by yesterday's standards is dead in the water today. Record year for bankruptcies will free up a lot of people to be reabsorbed into the more productive areas of society.  \n\nIf this all comes to fruition, Jerome Powell will have done exactly as he said all along - become the most unpopular guy in the history of the world by taking away the punch bowl that had been left out so long that people started surviving on it.  It is now gone, and can't come back.  \n\nThe Fed and fiscal stimulus combined got us between a rock and a hard place and we're about to push through the hard place with maximum pain.  The bank loan facility is just to make sure that banks can get cash out the door when called upon.  The incentives are set up to not use it any more than necessary.  There is a huge jump to begin with because banks are freaking out about liquidity with the runs.  And should be. I don't see the lending facility being enormously inflationary - just like TARP and the like weren't themselves all that inflationary.

What if this high discounting factor resets the P/E ratio to single digits for the S&P 500? P/E is just an inverse of rates as evidenced by it's blowout when rates were taken to nothing. \n\nWhat if the higher rates and engorgement of corporate debt and a more tepid consumer causes us to have crushed earnings and a slog back to healthy balance sheets over the course of years as a cyclical attempt to \"normalize\"? If the Fed is serious about getting us back to that, then we haven't even started the process. I'd argue that most pushed out their liquidity horizons on cheap debt to try to kick this refinancing can down the road as long as possible - which happens to be the reason why monetary policy works with that 'long and variable lag'. \n\nTheres an acronym going around that i didn't come up with for how rates effects are filtered into the economy to slow it down.

There are a lot of money managers that will have clients that pull funds to take to CD's at 4%. Why? Because everything exists on a risk to reward tradeoff. For some, risk of some small loss of purchasing power is more palatable than risk of loss (temporarily as duration risk repricing, or permanently as credit risk). \n\nFor instance, i can get short term investment grade bonds at 5.2% or I can get a tbill ETF at 4.6%. what do I choose? Tbills have zero risk, probably appreciate if things get mega shitty and the Fed is forced to take rates to zero again. ST IG Corp bonds are duration hedged and credit hedged, but if they're 50% BBB and credit downgrades start, you're not having fun. Well, maybe it makes sense in this case to take 60 bps less and have ultimate insurance (a low price on that tradeoff IMO). This is one tradeoff to illustrate that real people make these decisions every day and some lead to a rate lower than inflation. It's not like i have to sign up for inflation + x or hold in cash, period. \n\nOn the US sustaining interest on the debt at higher rates - this is a hot button political topic. I guess I'd handle the question in about 3 ways. First is a theoretical WIDE frame - and that is that if you think about it, the federal government can raise money any time they want to on a 1 off basis by selling assets to pay liabilities. How much of California is national parks that people would love to own a piece of? Ewww that idea sucks, but i mean, it's technically feasible and there's more than 30 trillion there, so it's not like \"Owners Equity\" in the country is negative (we're not FRC for God's sake lmao, kidding). \n\nIt's not only a yucky idea for our future generations but also a moral hazard that congress will want to lean on every time they can't do the hard stuff - fix healthcare, entitlements, or raise taxes.  So, if we say that's a 3rd rail issue and it's too yucky and exclude it as a possibility and just try to match cash flows to turn that deficit around then back to your question is it sustainable at higher levels? \n\nIt is until it isn't. For the immediate time being everyone still believes in the dollar big time. More this year than last by the looks of the DXY. So long as that's the case and treasuries are the safe haven asset then the Fed doesn't even have to pay their own interest rates they set. Fed says lower bound for immediate term is 4.5, which tbills too, but the gov can still issue 10 year at what, 3%? I don't pay attention to the 10 year but it's lower with the negative curve. As long as faith holds up then things are alright.... I guess. Honestly it's been our demise too. If we had to feel the pain of our indulgences then we'd probably change. Not come up with stuff like \"Modern Monetary Theory\" where ivory tower economists say things like \"deficits don't matter\". \n\nShould the sentiment on the dollar ever change our borrowing costs would explode over night which would not only reduce our ability to carry forward current policies but crush our ability to pay for past debts. I won't do the politics and fallout of it all, but from a financing perspective the cost would explode and short of balance sheet reduction (selling oil rights, parks, etc. to retire bonds) I'd say you'd have a hard time going forward. \n\nSaddest about that last piece, in some way you'd think selling assets to erase 30 trillion would at least feel a little good, but in reality the highest rated debt would be the most recently issued and the sale of Redwood National Forest in 2 acre lots would probably just go to the newest incurred deficit - another $500,000 hip replacement for one 90 year old lady in palm springs on Medicare.", "score": 4, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Firstly, I agree with pretty much everything you’re saying. \n\nI’d like to emphasize your point about tech/ai’s impact on our economy in the future. \n\nI’ve been saying for the past year that if we have a huge economic meltdown right now, then by the time we rebound people will not have as many opportunities as they do now to set themselves and their families up for a decent future and wealth. \n\nI don’t think this will be like the beginning of the internet.
