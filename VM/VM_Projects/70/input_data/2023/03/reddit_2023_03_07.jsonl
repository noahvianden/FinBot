AMZN was always (still is) unprofitable or trading at insane PE ratios, yet that didn't stop them from being a great investment. When TSLA when burning cash and their survival was in question, that was the time where an investor hit it 100x. AAPL once had triple digit PE before the massive iPhone profits came in. MSFT was before my time but who invested in the 80s or early 90s when a PC in every home was NOT the norm, nor was it inevitable it would be the norm.\n\n3.

As regards your second point, citing Tesla and Apple in particular as historical standards for a 100x bagger, one distinction you didn’t mention was that these two companies offered products which were - in some notable ways - very different from the product NVDA offers.  \n\nI’m curious if you disagree with what I’m about to write and see your reasoning behind the disagreement.  And for whatever it’s worth, I currently see NVDA’s fair value, given all the macro factors currently at work, as closer to 180, and I do hold a position to that effect.  \n\nSo here’s my distinction - Apple and Tesla offered tech solutions in a complete format.  That is, you bought an iPhone or you bought an electric car by that Musk guy, and you were set.  While AI is arguably a massive market in the future, NVDA’s customer won’t *directly* be the consumer the way that Tesla and Apple ultimately were.  I will say that NVDA *was* a direct solution for consumers with crypto mining, but as you astutely pointed out, that ship has largely sailed.

That is, you bought an iPhone or you bought an electric car by that Musk guy, and you were set.\n\nVertical integration can unlock a lot of potential for margin expansion. Sure an iPhone or Tesla 3 are competitive in hardware at the very least, but they're popular because people are buying into the whole solution. Your friends use Facetime and the Supercharger network is better, so an iPhone or a Tesla is more valuable to the consumer. Nvidia is doing similar with their software ecosystem and I think they will have more success. Their CEO is always hawking about how the cost of whatever their new product is almost irrelevant because of the amount of money that can be made or saved right now with their integrated solution.\n\nThe counterpoint is that there are limits to how high this will scale. There are a dozen tech companies in the world with the scale and resources to build a competing product to Nvidia at lower total cost for their uses. A few have already done it, and the number will grow as investment in AI processors ramps up. Same reasons Apple developed A series CPUs and finally M series for laptops/desktops, Amazon developed Graviton server CPUs. Meta and Microsoft may be happy to pay Nvidia a few billion per year on hardware right now, but don't think they will be happy to continue paying 70% margins when that investment increases by a factor of 10 or 100 over the years. They can and will build in house if the open market solutions do not drive down prices low enough.\n\nLarge enterprises like banks or healthcare might be happy to spend many millions or a few billion per year with Nvidia for a complete solution, because that is outside their core business.\n\nAt the end of the day, Nvidia didn't invent math and they can't maintain a monopoly over a field when so many companies will be spending so much into it.", "score": 5, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "A lot of people may not be aware Nvidia invented and patented DLSS, something AMD has copied and Intel has copied but their versions still are not quite as good. \n\nNvidia invented and patented Ray tracing in GPUs, something AMD has copied but their version still is not as good. \n\nBoth of these inventions have become key talking points in games and considered necessary in them now.

(most probable).\n\nThe second scenario is that markets realize they over reacted and we base/ hold 400+ into CPI -> CPI beats -> rally into FOMC. \n\nI am bullish on CPI and I think that it is going to show that a 50bps is not warranted yet. I believe what is happening is that the market is setting us up for a MASSIVE green CPI day. I am still waiting for official CPI consensus but as of now it looks really good for a beat (bullish). That CPI beat is going to dump the probability of a 50bps a lot and we are going to see a massive rally.   \n \n\nFOMC when they confirm 25bps will be well received, however, the dot plot coming out is going to be nasty and markets much like December are going to dump heavily. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/noyt6eugzdma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=166f07193fed0a3d74820c2d4439b7db49250567\n\nAs you can see we still have a DOOZY of data the rest of the week… I expect some 1% +/- opens over the next few days depending on what data does… going to be a real volatile week as we head into CPI next week. \n\n**SPY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cdu2c9dhzdma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=1af9b6e58c6bc43a2dcb2d302b2ebf2cbaee347e\n\nToday played out absolutely beautifully. We have that perfect evening doji star pattern that as I suspected would establish a new supply at 405.2. We not have a new supply put in short of the previous supplies (resistance) at 414-417. With this new resistance/ supply put in here we should look to take out lower supply at 396.46 before we push higher.\n\nAs I said before we do not want to leave a supply down below before we push higher. \n\nIF this sell off continues tomorrow if we reach that 394.7 to 396.5 range tomorrow we are going to come into some pretty hefty support. However, if we happen to lose 394.7 demand (support) tomorrow or really any day this week) then that would 100% set us up for a push lower back to 388.52 demand (support) that I was targeting before last weeks $12 rally. \n\n**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mpbfs6uhzdma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=b56ef0cb535d93c5a71f101d4788f80fe04701d2\n\nTaking a look at SPY daily here you can see we are still in this bigger blue breakout triangle here. With this new supply (resistance) being established today it perfectly correlates with our 405.3 channel resistance that has been a long standing pivot level on SPY. \n\nI frustratingly but conservatively did not take that 31dte put swing overnight. However, the risk of this going the other way today was there. \n\nTaking a look at the daily here the biggest thing to note is that we have no closed back below the daily 8, 20, 50 and 200ema. The last support remains at the 100ema which is hovering just over that 396.4 supply I mentioned before that was a target. The 100ema sits at 397 for tomorrow. \n\nTomorrow we have data before market open and we have JOLTS at 10am (data) when JPOW once again will start testifying to congress. There is a lot of unknown. On one hand what possibly could jpow say tomorrow or be asked tomorrow that could actually reverse this or make it sell of further? Not much in my opinion. \n\nThe biggest bear case is that the markets have not (with only one day) fully priced in a 50bps hike. So some more downside should be warranted. The other oddity is that for how reactive SPY was to that drop today the VIX was very underwhelming. Which shows people don’t fully believe it yet… \n\nI think as the data comes in this week with more big data Thursday and Friday we will have a very volatile EOW. I don’t think going long here is worth it for puts or calls. I do favor 390 before we retest 405 again, however, with so much data and JPOW anyone predicting this is just guessing.   \n \n\nI still remain under the consensus that regardless of what happens before CPI… that CPI print (unless consensus comes in hot af compared to Bloomberg/ Cleveland fed) will be very bullish and when markets (algos) see that the CPI DID come down and that its IS lowering compared to last CPI/ CORE YoY that the chances of a 50bps hike are gonna dump for whatever they are at back to non-existent. \n\nWhile there is always a chance that JPOW drops a 50bps bomb on the market… in all reality the chances of it is very slim. While inflation is not going to go straight to 2% easily and it will rebound (meaning YoY will come in OVER previous YoY) but I do not think it is going to be this CPI print as of now. \n\nHowever, when the FOMC meetings DOT PLOT comes out on March 22nd that is going to be very spicy…\n\nSPY Levels:\n\nSupply- 405.17 -> 396.46 -> 383.82  \n Demand- 394.68 -> 388.52  \n Daily Support- 398.2 -> 396.4 -> 394.6 -> 392.6  \n Daily Resistance- 399.6 -> 401.5 -> 404.5\n\n**FUTURES SUPPLY AND DEMAND**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7irg8vgizdma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=83a4e0f9cbaba94375eaca79781a8668ff85d3ea\n\nFutures had a beautiful pattern today too with supply/ demand playing out perfectly. As I had mentioned we were looking for that 4055 new supply (resistance) to be established and we officially got that today. Not only that though we came down perfectly to take out previous 4015 and 3991 supplies from the last 2 weeks. \n\nWith 3991 and 4015 out of the weigh this opens up a push lower to 3960 and 3920 demand. My ultimate target for downside remains 3920. However, if we get a bounce tomorrow and markets decide to rally into CPI then I would be looking for 4096. \n\n**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yq94k95jzdma1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=a9d94df3a51dd854b587404e9912aca65cf6f374\n\nTaking a look at the daily chart here on futures we are just chopping inside of this red channel that stretches from 3920 to 4095. \n\nWith a breakdown last week to 3925 -> recovery to 4082 yesterday -> pattern would suggest a breakdown to minimally 3920. This would be a classic 123 rollercoaster as I have talked about so many times. \n\nFutures today unlike spy closed below its daily 8, 20, 50, 100 and 200ema. However, it is currently sitting directly on the 100ema. We did bounce direction off the support from Friday at 3983 today too. There is always a scenario where we get a massive double bottom after a drop like this. \n\nIf we were to backtest resistance my targets would be 4020 and 4055. \n\nFutures levels:\n\nSupply- 4054 -> 4160  \n Demand- 3960 -> 3920  \n Daily support- 3990 -> 3983 -> 3955 -> 3945 -> 3920  \n Daily resistance- 4020 -> 4053\n\n**DAILY TRADING LOG**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pkz21nnjzdma1.png?width=775&format=png&auto=webp&s=73e0589dfaf21061f781bcdf697541ab3ea42547\n\nOverall despite today being a highly volatile fed day and that massive $4 dump instantly at 10am I had a pretty good day trading. \n\nI unfortunately found myself in one of my level to level calls. I did not know jpow had a pre-released statement or I would have exited my calls before 10am. I did not expect a -$4 candle but it is what it is. Got a terrible fill on my stop loss too.   \n   \n \n\nOutside of that was a pretty great day of trading. I did take some long puts (30dte) in the morning and set a 10% stop loss and was a victim of that rogue $2 green candle at 1215pm. I am pretty bitter about that as I went longer dte on purpose and I would have ended up with a nice 15-20% win. It is what it is but that is my only gripe from today.
