By 2024 end, 2.5% and then 2025 2.4%.\n\nPress Conference will be in 30 minutes (9:45AM ET time) - [https://www.youtube.com/live/eqwfatWtILg?feature=share](https://www.youtube.com/live/eqwfatWtILg?feature=share) (Official ECB YT channel)\n\n**\\[LIVE\\] PRESS CONFERENCE COMMENTS:**\n\n* Inflation forecasts was downgraded NOT because of SVB et al, but due to decreasing energy prices. ECB forecasts down early March, earlier than SVB et al.\n* Fiscal policy should be focused on TEMPORARY and TARGETED energy relief.\n* Services are from rising wages, pent up demand, rising profit margins (ie price gouging).\n* Low rates must not be here, otherwise inflation will rebound.\n* China reopening upward pressure to inflation, but SVB et al. will cause disflation.\n* Guidance - March 1st completed forecasts, but due to SVB issues, current market conditions have changed dramatically, but we will react appropriately to data.\n* We are not waning on our commitment to fight inflation. We shall make our decisions on the data. We are determined to fight inflation back to 2%.\n* **3-4 out of 20 or was it 26? (25%) people dissented and wanted to wait for SVB et al to calm down then hike 50bps next time.**\n* We don't see any contradiction between price stability and financial stability. We handle them separately.\n* **Stumbling stumbling... not a nice look for the ECB....**\n* Inflation remains elevated. Services, Core all elevated.\n* **PROFIT MARGINS:** First mention EVER of price gouging (lol) - ie hiking prices causes large profit margins.\n\nOn the US side - US Building Permits +13.8% vs +0% expected. Housing Starts +9.8% vs +0% expected. Jobless claims 192K vs 205K. Jobless claims essentially reversed course, and went down again - showcasing the US economy is a strong strong aircraft carrier.
