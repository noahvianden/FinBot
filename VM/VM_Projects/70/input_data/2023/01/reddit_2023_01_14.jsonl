Obviously not, so you raise prices enough that you can meet demand AND a good waiting time, IE <3 MONTHS.  If people are willing to pay that price ( and 6 months ago people were willing to pay insane prices) you increase prices to not have a too long of a wait list, when people are not willing to pay those prices OR when you increase enough production, you lower prices to get to market clearing prices.\n\nBut I see that you are an avid Realtesla poster, so I'm probably wasting my time.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "In Q4, you could order a Tesla in California and have it by the end of the quarter, so your argument about waiting 6-12 months isn’t relevant.
