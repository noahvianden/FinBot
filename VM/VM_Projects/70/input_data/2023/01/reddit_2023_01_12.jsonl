{"title": "Carvana (CVNA)", "selftext": "I am long CVNA. While the company has credit problems due to their loans outstanding with Apollo (the ruthless credit investor), I believe that the company has been caught in a once in a lifetime market downdraft in used cars, which have been severely impacted by rising interest rates and supply chain issues. That said, I believe that if CVNA is able to make it through these challenges, the opportunity on the back end of this is meaningful. CVNA competes against many mom and pop used car dealers, many of which will go out of business due to this market. Thus, CVNA has a meaningful market share opportunity on the back end of this situation, which will lead to higher sales volumes. The company has also done a significant amount of work to streamline operations, which combined with higher sales volumes should drive the company towards their long-term profitability goals. I also believe that Ernie (CEO) and his team are top-tier operators in a sector not known for good management teams. Overall, while CVNA has a low-single-digit market share now, the opportunity to drive meaningfully greater market share in the years to come make me excited about the opportunity. Also, let us not forget that AMZN faced similar issues in the dot-com crash (problems with debt, falling share price, wall street investors turning against the company), yet has grown to become one of the greatest businesses we've ever seen.

With short interest at 60%, and an EV/EBITDA 15-30% lower than the rest of the auto industry, it's safe to say the stock price is lower than it should be, quite possibly because of the Sep 2020 to Sep 2022 extreme overvaluation (partially because online businesses were skyrocketing during this time) leading hedge funds eyeing the lack of profits into heavier and heavier short positions.

They need to make better decisions on what inventory to buy and what to pass, and they definitely need to be smarter about pricing (they likely missed out on a fair bit of topline during the pandemic because dealers were buying their inventory to flip). But that would require more overhead, not less, and would go against whatever AI driven approach they think they’ve been pioneering.\n\nAs a car guy who has purchased from them, the purchase price was cheaper than it should have been, the process was fast, but paperwork was slow, and they messed it up costing me extra in registration.
