{"title": "1-10-23 SPY/ ES Futures and Tesla Daily Market Analysis", "selftext": "Twas the eve of the eve of CPI and all through the markets not a bull nor a bear was willing to make a move while ole daddy JPOW spoke. Despite their being not a whisper in the markets there could not be a crisper morning of volatility. With a flat afternoon we just knew that the bulls would attempt to retake 390.1… with a key level being retaken it only makes sense that the bulls would not be forsaken again. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8lv3y22qwaba1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=c52c04eac891300888f98ce969307fe23fa5d4c2\n\nThe fake out appears as of now to be nothing more than a retest of support before we push forward. Despite yesterdays clear rejection of 390.1 we actually managed to find support here at the daily 20ema which also happens to be the previous resistance (now support) area that we consolidated in for the last 3 weeks. With bulls making a breakout back over key 390.1 and bullishly engulfing on the daily candle with that nice daily 20ema support bounce this SHOULD see a bigger push up now.\n\nThis is actually the first time we have had two candles closed over the daily 20ema since December CPI. IF we get a third that is a very bullish omen for the markets and we are actually very close to a bullish 8/20ema crossover on the daily. \n\nWith CPI estimates (minus Cleveland fed) being lowered yet again today I still lean for a bullish Thursday which will put us back in that previous 394.2 to 402.5 consolidation area by EOW. \n\nHowever, the question is what will tomorrow bring? We have no data economic wise and we also have no speakers tomorrow as of now that I can see. The day before CPI can go either way. Some CPIs we get a pretty impressive sell off leading into it (much like November) and then other CPIs we get a huge rally into it (much like December CPI). The technical would favor a bullish day tomorrow but the technical yesterday also favored a bearish day and yet here we are. \n\nKey support- 390.1 -> 387.8 -> 386.3\n\nKey resistance – 391.6 -> 394.2\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bqz4nzjqwaba1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=068ac81b152cdeaba269892f38b1b0b6daf641a9\n\nFutures daily actually looks even more bullish than SPYs daily. We had the similar bullish engulfing candle on futes and we also managed to bounce off the daily 8 and daily 20ema. We might actually get our bullish crossover there tomorrow which has not happened since October… \n\nWith a close over the daily 8, 20 and 50ema we should begin to think about the daily 200ema which is near 4000 currently. We also are seeing that futures did close back in the December consolidation channel of 3935 to 4035.\n\nKey support- 3935 -> 3920 -> 3895  \n key resistance- 3966 -> 4000\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1y5q481rwaba1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=f911997ee9cbaf086c88b005e1176e00fdf2ed48\n\nTesla remains in this clear consolidation channel with another rejection off the 123 resistance area. This time though it came down and retest support of the daily 8ema and closed over 118.5 support. \n\nWith a failure to lose the daily 8ema and the possible double bottom off 118.5 I favor upside for tesla tomorrow but it needs to take out that 123 resistance level tomorrow. If it can take that out and CLOSE over that with the help of a bullish CPI we very well might find Tesla on a push for its daily 20ema. \n\nKey support- 118.5 -> 113.2\n\nKey resistance- 123.2 -> 126.4\n\n**Daily log-** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zgfwjclrwaba1.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=b801106e03615be704f57b42c3c05b79b7f2cfaf\n\nSwang some tesla puts overnight that amazingly were not that red at open despite about a 1% open on Tesla. Closed those out ASAP. From there I had a really great morning of trading on SPY with that heavy volatility. Took a Tesla play that unfortunately put me in the red and with two back to back stop losses on L2L plays on SPY ended up with a small red day today.\n\nTesla finds itself back on the naughty list outside of a swing play every now and then. That put play would have been up an easy 20% but it hit my stop loss before I could ever see profits. \n\nThe EOD price action after we broke through 388.5 was so weak and we were so close to 390.1 that I missed the uptrend and wasn’t able to capitalize on that for gains. Was fairly tempted to swing a Tesla or SPY call but decided to sit cash instead.", "id": "108ot66", "created_utc": 1673393591.0, "score": 69, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 66, "comments": [{"body": "I have a feeling we are being led bullish for an \"unexpected\" bearish outcome.
