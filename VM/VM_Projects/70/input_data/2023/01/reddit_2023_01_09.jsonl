{"title": "The Fake Breakout… 1-9-23 SPY/ ES Futures and Tesla Daily Market Analysis", "selftext": "I presented the question on Friday whether that was a fake breakout or the start of the breakout and until about 1115pm today I would have favored that this was a clear breakout… however, we are now seeing that this was truly one of the biggest and most epic fake outs we have had in a long time. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l17mpxk693ba1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=55d33e9f09ba7a1ad588be055de8b5c9ab34f644\n\nAlso for anyone unaware… JPOW speaks at 9am tomorrow…..\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mejncyx693ba1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=c866092b701111d2b227b474eedcb04b66a2e8af\n\nWe have a couple of things going for us on the daily chart right now. We attempted after breaking on of the $10 376.6 to 386.4 range on Friday to breakout into the 390.1 to 405.2 channel today. We had a very convincing run and actually attempted to break back into the previous 393.3 to 402.3 consolidation channel. \n\nAs you can see we actually have a pretty convincing cup and handle formed here on the daily chart. Something else that I mentioned last week was that this was (as of Friday and today) the first CPI since September that did not have a pretty aggressive sell off leading into it. However, with this massive rejection with this evening doji star pattern here on SPY we should look for a possible sell off heading into CPI on Thursday. JPOW might be the red catalyst for the market and for the sell off starting tomorrow morning. \n\nWith a failure to break through and that huge rejection of 390.1 then I am eyeing a retest of at least 382 this week. However, I remain bullish for CPI on Thursday. \n\nThe probable case that I am eyeing here is that we are going to see a retrace over the next two days (most likely fueled by JPOW in the AM). This retrace should give us about a 2-3% drop which means I will eye a retest of 378-380 support area before market close on Wednesday. \n\nWith the current CPI numbers I am seeing I am eyeing that CPI will be bullish for markets and most likely we will look for a close on Friday over 390.1… that would then give markets the fuel it needs to push back to that 393 to 403 area for next week. If we choose to consolidate again over the next weeks leading into FOMC that 390.1 to 405.2 area is the most probable area of consolidation. \n\nIf spy was to lose and close under 386.3 tomorrow that actually puts it back in the previous 376 to 386 consolidation channel it was in. \n\nKey support- 387.8 -> 386.3 -> 384.4 -> 382.6\n\nKey resistance- 390.1 -> 391.6 -> 394.2\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gus9f8g793ba1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebea718bb91d80d4caebb991947403a56784ad6a\n\nSpeaking of the previous consolidation channel ES actually attempted to break back through the previous 3935 support channel, rejected and closed under 3920 which puts it right back in that previous 3805 to 3920 consolidation channel.\n\nIF you remember from Friday I mentioned that 390.1 and 3910 were both key pivot levels.\n\nSupport- 3895 -> 3870 -> 3830\n\nResistance- 3920 -> 3935 -> 3965\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/71p6u0w793ba1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=e5888bd2e0beca8cfdc39facf9bdb68639336a11\n\nIf you remember on Friday I mentioned that for Tesla I was eyeing this new consolidation channel from 102.9 to 123.1. I mentioned my upside target was 123.1 and that if we were able to break through and close over that then we could very well finally eye the daily 20ema retest we haven’t gotten in weeks. However, today despite closing over the daily 8ema Tesla actually is presenting with my favorite candle stick pattern “the abandoned baby” pattern. Despite finally breaking the previous falling wedge we are once again in a falling wedge. \n\nThis abandoned baby pattern should result in a pretty large retrace tomorrow for Tesla. It also left a large $3 gap down to 114.39.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z21df6c893ba1.png?width=745&format=png&auto=webp&s=45a69b14e47af311785655e4b7bb5008d8664198\n\nCycle wise this actually is the biggest relief rally that Tesla has had since the September sell off started. This actually makes a lot of sense since we are at a very key 111.5 support area (weekly support from 2020) and we also had the largest sell off and longest sell off yet starting in the beginning of December. Technically this was a two day rally but its only documented as a 1 day relief rally because Friday had that massive red open which then had a big rally of nearly 12%. \n\nPer cycle studies here this is about as probable of a top as we are going to have on Tesla. With the cycle top, the hard rejection off 123 channel resistance and the abandoned baby pattern I favor a retrace tomorrow on Tesla. I would eye a retest of support at 113 area. \n\n**Daily log-**\n\nI swang some SPY and Tsla calls this morning which I was able to close for 70%+ each to start this week off on a very green note. Nothing better than starting the week off very much so in the green. \n\nToday until about 2pm felt like I was just trading against myself all day long. Ended up finally getting some decent wins EOD. The premiums today were so beyond unfavorable its not even funny. \n\nEasy 50-60 cent moves that shoulda netted 5-10% gains were barely netting 2-3% gains. I also managed a few times to perfectly time some exits that the next second dumped or popped and woulda 3-4x’d my gains. \n\nOverall a green day but I hope that the premiums are much better to trade tomorrow. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/55riigx893ba1.png?width=756&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9274fc95544d522ce92b989547fefad66a832a6\n\nI am very curious what JPOW is going to say tomorrow and more importantly I am curious how the markets are going to react to what he has to say tomorrow. \n\nThe biggest thing I am noticing from the fed speakers this and last week is that they do NOT think we should be slowing rate hikes… even more interesting is that currently a 25bps is the most probable priced in rate hike and there is even a decent amount of no rate hike priced in…. depending on what CPI brings Thursday this could be a big bullish or negative catalyst as we approach the end of the month. \n\nThere is zero chance JPOW goes for 0bps and I think even a 25bps is unlikely as that would be back to back slowing of rate hikes which he has already said he does not want to do…", "id": "107r60k", "created_utc": 1673300934.0, "score": 128, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 73, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|10|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|3941|**Previous Best DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/zxm2pi/is_the_santa_rally_over_122822_spy_es_futures_and/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/zhbkpu/12922_spy_weekly_market_analysis_and_recap_plus/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/vwhw7o/how_to_trade_cpi_day/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/v8vbnd/6922_spy_daily_ta_bonus_cpi_day_trade_breakdown/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/zazoex/is_the_bottom_in_or_is_the_next_top_in_12222_spy/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xsd18z/93022_spy_es_futures_apple_and_tesla_weekly_recap/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/up5xtr/51322_spy_weekly_ta/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uxvyrg/52522_spy_daily_ta/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/w5k3q1/the_only_fomc_week_ta_dd_youll_ever_need_to_read/) \n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\n ^^[**Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse) ^^[BanBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/banbets/)  ^^VoteBot ^^[FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/votebot/) ^^[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/leaderboard/) ^^- ^^[**Keep_VM_Alive**](https://www.patreon.com/visualmod)\n\nHey /u/DaddyDersch, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.\n>TL;DR: This market is in a very precarious situation and I am currently not bullish or bearish for the week.
