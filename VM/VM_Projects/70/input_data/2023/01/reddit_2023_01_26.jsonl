We're now well establish above the 50-days MMA. The 50d MMA and the uptrend support line will act as strong support IMO.\n\n**Sentiment:**\n\nThere is a shift in the sentiment, good news trigger more buy behavior than bad news trigger sell off, Microsoft and Tesla Earnings is an example of that. They beat expectations but the bar was lowered, even though guidance is not even rosy or some metrics come out bad (5-y low margin for Tesla) this is not enough to sell.\n\n**Soft Landing:**\n\nThe Fed tightened the monetary policy since March 2022, raising rates and (slowly) starting QT. We've seen a couple of quarters with slightly negative GDP growth but strong economic metrics, Q4 GDP growth is better than expected, while inflation is being tamed properly, especially if you look at it on a annualized base. Company guidance are not super rosy, but not apocalyptic either, and when you look at Market's reactions, it feels like it is properly priced. Some might say the Fed (and other central banks) will keep being very hawkish given the current situation (growth, strong job market, market recovery etc.) but people know they cannot take the risk to destroy the economy while being virtually limited by the level of debts of most of the countries. My take is that they will tolerate a higher level of Inflation than usual (around 3-4%) to so the burden of the debt will be bearable (paid by people holding bonds via retirement funds for instance).\n\n**Tech Stocks recovery**\n\nThe current strong YTD rebound is led by tech stocks, particularly META, TSLA, AAPL, NVDA and other. Some of these stocks have been crushed in 2022 and were very extended to the downside, mean reversion is happening now and unless there are unexpected events or very gloomy guidance from several of them, there is no reason it would dip again as it did end of 2022\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBeside one very concentrated bet (AMRS), I am not heavily invested. I told most of my positions early December.
