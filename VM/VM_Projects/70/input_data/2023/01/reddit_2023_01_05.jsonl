{"title": "1-5-23 SPY/ ES Futures and Tesla Daily Market Analysis", "selftext": "  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/psecndgeqaaa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=a79a17607cd3f473d6bc22a3a47ca9413a527f06\n\nInteresting jobs data out today… ADP shows strong strength in the workforce, however, we had the lowest initial jobless claim since the last week of September. This data with the revision of the revision is very interesting going into tomorrow. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q2e6fqseqaaa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=28d3f9f59af6593a7fff3e84467a92ee1aaa1022\n\nTomorrow is also a huge data day for the markets too. Looking at the trend of UE numbers we have held anywhere from 3.5% to 3.7% UE rate since 4/1/22. We have not seen a reading lower than 3.5 and we have not had one over 3.7% since march. \n\nRemember the lower that UE rate is the more bearish that markets will receive that data. The lower the UE rate is the more strong the economy is and the more room the fed may have to go. We are average a +/- 1% open on these UE rate days. I do expect a bigger move at open. \n\nWith that being factored in we could see an open near 375.6 or we could see an open near 383.2.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k5wa0ybfqaaa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=e56482519255abc9eb7f88cf579c5e0b2dd72fb5\n\nI noted something interesting on the daily chart. If we take a look back at November CPI starting the day after CPI we held about a $10 range for the whole month from November 11th to the next CPI on December 12th with the exeception of 5 days total closing outside of that $10 range. Note on November 30th was that JPOW speech where the market randomly rocketed 3.15% on his “bullish” news. It took two days to erase all of those gains… if we eliminate that artificial and rogue pump all but one day from CPI to CPI closed in the same $10 range… \n\nLooking at the December CPI till present after the 3 day post CPI drop we have closed all of our daily candles within the same about $10 range… We are in some massive consolidation right now for really the last two months. \n\nIf we took away 6 of the last 37 days essentially all 31 days have maintained a $10 range from high to low. The next thing I am noting here is that there is a very clear bear flag forming on the daily chart. If we look at this daily bear flag here IF we were to finally breakout of this $10 range we could see our new $10 range form down below. I would target 360 to 370 if that was to happen. \n\nI still unless unemployment data tomorrow can finally break us out of this range believe that we are going to see SPY hold this say $10 range with a few outliers until CPI next Thursday. That CPI is either going to put us back in the same 392 to 403 range OR its going to leg us down to the next $10 range down below which I anticipate would be 360 to 370 area as we spent a lot of time in October. We also sent a lot of time int eh 370 to 378 range in June and some in October and November. \n\nFocusing back on the daily technical we maintained that red support line with a near perfect support line bounce. However we did close below 379.6 which I would consider one of the more important support lines from the last three weeks of trading. \n\nI mentioned EOD yesterday I was bearish and favored overnight puts with the daily 20ema rejection with also a rejection of the upper blue consolidation channel. Today we closed under the daily 8ema completely. With a rejection of the daily 20ema for two days in a row and now closing back under the daily 8ema I favor bearish but still recognize the incredible strength of this blue consolidation channel. \n\nKey support- 379.3 -> 379 -> 376.6 -> 374.1\n\nKey resistance- 380.7 -> 381.8 -> 383.1\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k97ov3vfqaaa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=d9b52f5d8e7765a9cc6838ccc453c04c0c950c09\n\nTaking a look at futures here you can see the same upper consolidation channel from November and now our current blue consolidation channel. I am seeing three rejections in a row of the daily 20ema, and a closure below the daily 8ema again. It is not quite a bearish engulfing candle but it is very close. I am bearish for tomorrow. However we did manage to hold that red support line. \n\nWith a rejection on the upside today at 3872 that should favor more downside. There really is an even tighter consolidation range of 3872 to 3842 that 9 of the last 12 candles have closed within. There has only been one candle closed below 3842 since futes has entered this consolidation period. This should and could be a signal of the bear flags pending break down. \n\nSupport- 3832 -> 3805 -> 3787\n\nResistance- 3872 -> 3895\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eihgmlegqaaa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=d5c47ce1995e10b83f63dcf04cdf2cb28e4f19a9\n\nTesla came within 40 cents of putting in back to back inside days. I did expect a continuation day today based on structure. We did see a red day today however it was not quite as bearish as I expected. This 108 to 110 area is putting in some heavy support here on Tesla. \n\nWe very well COULD be finding support on Tesla here. If you remember 111.5 is support that dates back to August of 2020. This is not too surprising after 3 months of straight dropping on Tesla for it to finally enter some consolidation. \n\nLooking at the daily unless it opens under 107.97 (-2.2%) we are actually going to break that red falling wedge resistance. Going into next weekend if we did break that resistance on the daily that could provide some upside relief. With this 108 to 110 area proving to be strong support I would eye a push back up to 120-130 next week IF we get a break of resistance. However if we did maintain that resistance I would still eye 94.5 support area. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/50462skhqaaa1.png?width=626&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce0252af6cccc38088cd3e88c4894550f98f0a94\n\nNot a whole lot going on with the VIX currently we did break that diamond support I mentioned and we are now facing another breakout triangle on the daily chart here. We are holding the daily 8 and 20ema as support. This actually could be the first time the daily 8 and 20ema crossover bullishly (bearish for stocks… bullish for VIX) since October 24th. This movement on the VIX is actually giving me more information to support the bear flag breaking and we see a sell off going into CPI. \n\nIf we lose this consolidation pattern on SPY before CPI happens we could end up seeing a leg down before CPI. CPI could end up being the bullish move back up to prevent the next major sell off assuming the data comes in as bullish as it looks now. \n\nWith this trend we very well could see a repeat of November where we were holding in the 380s going into CPI and saw a bigger sell off leading into CPI that put us down at 370 support. \n\n**Daily log-**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z120pz7iqaaa1.png?width=802&format=png&auto=webp&s=19aab38481cc36a8d0092d7e2a13b10befd9e524\n\nI am finding myself having to become increasingly patient in this market and I also find myself struggling to take high probability setups due to rogue movements we have seen. The only L2L play that stopped out today for me was the 10am setup that looked like the perfect setup for puts however we ended up with a massive $2 pump out of nowhere only to give it all back up the very next candle. \n\nScalps were pretty great today but I ended up getting greedy on a possible EOD breakdown trying to test my technical to play out and for spy to continue only to see 7% gains immediately go to my stop loss. \n\nOverall still a good day and still a nice little week going here.", "id": "104bezf", "created_utc": 1672955640.0, "score": 83, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 73, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|10|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|3907|**Previous Best DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/zxm2pi/is_the_santa_rally_over_122822_spy_es_futures_and/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/zhbkpu/12922_spy_weekly_market_analysis_and_recap_plus/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/vwhw7o/how_to_trade_cpi_day/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/v8vbnd/6922_spy_daily_ta_bonus_cpi_day_trade_breakdown/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/zazoex/is_the_bottom_in_or_is_the_next_top_in_12222_spy/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xsd18z/93022_spy_es_futures_apple_and_tesla_weekly_recap/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/up5xtr/51322_spy_weekly_ta/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uxvyrg/52522_spy_daily_ta/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uwdk8h/52322_spy_daily_ta_bonus_fomc_minutes_reaction_ta/) \n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\n ^^[**Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse) ^^[BanBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/banbets/)  ^^VoteBot ^^[FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/votebot/) ^^[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/leaderboard/) ^^- ^^[**Keep_VM_Alive**](https://www.patreon.com/visualmod)\n\nHey /u/DaddyDersch, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.\n>TL;DR: I am starting to become bearish on the market going into next week and I am leaning towards a move down to 350-360 range.
