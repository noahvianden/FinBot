I believe in India. Sort of. It's never as stupendous or as dire as people make it out to be. I agree with you that corruption and default risks are probably blown out of proportion in investor's minds. Indeed, you get more leeway as a defaulting company in India than you do in the U.S. Witness the Vijay Mallya escapade (btw, whatever happened to him?).\n\nTurn to the negatives. There are few innovators in the Nifty 50 companies, and I don't just mean \"tech\". Nearly 40% by market cap is banks. Earnings growth and margin are going to grow at a sedate pace in that sector, punctuated by the occasional excitement brought on by the likes of Nirav Modi (btw, whatever happened to him?). There are only two tech companies worth mentioning, Infosys and Tata, and they are barely worth mentioning in the global context. There are no companies setting the pace, for example, like Taiwan Semiconductor does in chip manufacturing and design.\n\nCorporate governance in India isn't great. Then again, it isn't great in the US either. Still, who holds these executives to account? The promoters own 26% of the outstanding shares, which supposedly provides immunity from shareholder action (I never got a proper legal opinion on whether this is true). Anyway, underperformers don't seem to be fired. I have yet to see an investment manager confronting the executives for sub-par performance.\n\nEarnings growth has been good, but less so earnings per share. The difference between the two being the massive amount of capital that has been sucked in by corporate India, which by the way, is entirely natural for a country such as India. But EPS growth is ultimately what matters to an investor.\n\nLastly, on the macro environment. Your starting point is early 2000s. The license raj had been dismantled only in the last decade. FDI was just beginning to roll in and companies like Reliance grew exponentially. The rupee was largely steady against the dollar in the first decade of this century. All that ended c. 2010. The rupee depreciation over the last decade has also coincided with relatively poor corporate performance. Compare, for example, iShares India 50 ETF ($INDY) with $SPY in the last 10-12 years. The currency depreciation is largely the result of the government failing to curb inflation. Lastly, that demographic dividend you speak of - it will come to naught if the country underinvests in education and healthcare. Go around Delhi, you will see young men largely underemployed or working as guards, standing in front of houses all day long. This is no way to capitalize on a young population. The countryside is worse. Having said all this, I still like India. I feel I understand the country and its people much better than I do, say, China. I will always own some Indian stocks.\n\nedit: misread the comment on default and thought you meant corporate default. Country default isn’t an issue either, imo. India issues mostly local currency debt. However, the state banks do borrow a lot in foreign currency, and those are backed by the govt.

There is no question that China has carried out the most successful project of lifting people out of poverty ever witnessed in human history. China may yet fall into the [middle income trap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_income_trap), but that is better than the poverty trap. If India can accomplish something similar -- and I don't necessarily mean through similar means, which for China was export-led industrialization -- but I mean in outcomes, I would be happy to see that, regardless of stock market returns. \n\nWhat is standing in India's way are poor policies and an overweening bureaucracy. Poor policies are due, in part , to the lack of money to implement good policies. Tax revenue is pretty low at mid-teens of GDP, iirc. Compare that to the US or Europe which is upwards of 30%. So, things such as education and public health suffer. An example - untreated effluent being discharged all along the Ganges leading to very poor health outcomes for the hundreds of millions who live in the river basin. Providing health services after someone has fallen ill is less than ideal. Far better to take preventative action. Yet, there is very little in the way of treating waste water. Along the same vein, air pollution puts a sizable chunk of the population at risk of lung disease. To solve these problems requires money or the ability to extract corvée labor, which is neither moral nor practical. Exempting farmers from income taxes has not helped (yes, political challenges). Speaking of labor, India's extensive protection of labor rights has also exacted its toll. The difficulties in freely hiring and firing people has made many firms operate at less than optimal size. The bureaucratic state grinds everything to a near standstill. I am always amazed at Indian companies operate despite the system. Which is also why I rather understand why corruption occurs. \n\nThis is a long response. Bottom line: India's transformation will have to come from within. FDI or the lack thereof isn't going to move the needle that much in terms of welfare improvement. India needs its own Deng Xiaoping.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Is it fair to compare a narrow index of 50 with a very broad 500?\n\nWhat would it look like if you compared with the top 50 out of the s&p?", "score": 60, "replies": [{"body": "The S&P is so unequally weighted that the bottom 450 companies pretty much do not matter.", "score": 17, "replies": [{"body": "They don’t matter, until they do. \n\nFor example if an S&P fund only owns .5% of the fund in a company with $100b market cap, that is probably still millions of shares that they own(at a lower price per share).

Also the themes you look for Indian markets are different than you would in the US. You won't find world class innovation here that is exported out to the world. But, there are other ways to play the market. So I am talking about returns 15-25%. So two broad themes to look for 1) Under Penetration of certain products. India is a huge, growing and diverse country with a huge middle class that don't have access to all the products that West take for granted. QSR chains? Yeah it isn't in every part of the country yet. Cables and wires buisnesses? Same. Even credit penetration is significantly lower. So prudent banks like HDFC Bank is a good way to play it. Inspite of being largest banks in India, it's consistently growing at 20% cagr. Also. It's gross NPAs have never been above 2%. Theme 2) lowest cost producer of certain products: India having cheap labour has an advantage of manufacturing products for lower costs. Along the lines there are also opportunities in pharma and chemical divisions. Companies that manufacture for global innovators.  Big pharma are trying to outsource manufacturing and synthesis of patented drugs to reduce spending on manufacturing given low probability of success of drug discovery. So when working on projects of confidentiality, they would need a reliable partner. There are several companies that have worked with innovators companies before and would continue to do so due to the trust.
