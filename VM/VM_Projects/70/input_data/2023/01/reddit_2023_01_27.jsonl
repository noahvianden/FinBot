{"title": "TSLA DD - tech or car company?", "selftext": "Position:  -10 144P 02/03/2023 \n\n**The methodology for this DD:**\n\nI scoped my analysis around answering one simple question: Is TSLA a tech company or a car company? \n\nI decided to limit the metrics to some key ones that I thought was relevant when answering the above question from a financial perspective. I understand that this is not an end all be all analysis, and that there are other ways to evaluate the question that might produce a different answer, but I don’t have the time, resources or skills to do a full analytical study – I’ll leave that up to the big institutions who have billions riding on it.\n\nI looked at only 4 key metrics and compared them to other companies in either the automotive sector or the tech sector and only based on their most recent quarterlies, so there are some timing discrepancies, but they shouldn’t matter a great deal since I’m not looking at day to day, week to week moves. I understand there are many other factors to consider, but I’m a regard and kinda lazy so I didn’t dive into those as much.\n\n**The numbers taken from Google Finance (current as of 25 JAN 23, Q4 data):**\n\n  \n\n|Company|Market Cap|Net Profit Margin|Net Income|P/E|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Tesla|502.20B|15.34|3.29B|49.37|\n|Toyota|237.69B|4.71|3.35B|9.62|\n|BMW|71B\\*|7.48|3.03B\\*|3.39|\n|Ferrari|46.66B|18.06|245.69M\\*|44.90|\n|Apple|2.28T|22.99|20.72B|23.55|\n|Google|1.27T|20.13|13.91B|19.74|\n|Tencent|500B\\*\\*|28.51|5.89B\\*\\*\\*|19.38|\n|NVIDIA|487.12B|11.47|680M|84.23|\n\n\\* Converted to $ from EUR.   \n\\*\\* Converted to $ from HKD.   \n\\*\\*\\* Converted to $ from CNY.\n\n**Assumption: Tesla is a tech company.**\n\nTesla’s market cap and P/E are closer to the tech companies. This is justified by their larger net profit margin. Their revenue growth over the past few years seems to follow the trajectory of maturing tech companies. Granted they are nowhere near Apple and Google as far as market cap, although there was a time about a year ago when they were getting close, so it’s not crazy to think they might be able to pull it off again. Currently Tesla has the 7th largest market cap, which is closer to Apple (#1) and Google (#4) than Toyota (#48), so it seems the market is pricing them as a tech company rather than an automobile company. In fact, companies with comparable market caps to Tesla such as Tencent and NVIDA are tech companies that also have higher net profit margins and higher P/E ratios than the car companies.\n\nElon Musk is Tesla’s best asset and worst liability. His background in tech, ownership of Space X and now Twitter are potential catalysts for Tesla to expand beyond just automobile manufacturing. However, Musk is also eccentric and impulsive and there is no guarantee that he will bring Tesla along for his next big hit, assuming he’s successful in commercializing the many emerging technologies he’s invested in.\n\n**Assumption: Tesla is a car company.**\n\nTesla’s profit margin is better than the car manufacturers, but not as high as the tech companies. It’s easy to explain the high profit margins when considering that Tesla is still seen as a luxury auto manufacturer. While their Model 3s, which are their cheapest models, are much more affordably priced than their flagship Model S vehicles, it is still priced around $43,990, while a BMW X1 goes for $36,600 and a Toyota Corolla goes for $20,425. The advantage of being a luxury auto company is that their target customers are willing to pay a premium for their cars and thus increases their margins. A good example of this is Ferrari, which has a similar net profit margin and P/E, but is less than 1/10 of Tesla’s market cap. As Tesla attempts to break into the more general market, where the customer base is far more sensitive to higher price premiums, this will quickly eat into profit margins, unless the company diversifies into other areas. Unfortunately, the main source of Tesla’s revenue remains automobile sales, and there’s no signs this will change anytime soon. While Tesla attempts to diversify their business with home power solutions, neuralink, helper robots and AI (more practically for full self driving, but with potential applications in other areas), these ventures have proven elusive and unready for commercial production anytime soon. \n\nThe car market is saturated and competitive. The only areas where the market has space to expand also happen to be low wealth. This means that the customer base will be far more price sensitive. This is why Toyota and Hyundai are so popular in poorer countries. While China, as an emerging market has potential, there’s also a great deal of risk involved, especially if the Chinese government decides to favor domestic auto companies to a much greater extent. Practically every major car company has pivoted to EVs, and while Tesla is still solidly in the lead, it’s just a matter of time before Tesla begins to see some strong competition, and market saturation means that Tesla needs to take market share away from the traditional auto companies, because most people don’t buy EVs in addition to ICE vehicles, but rather to replace them. \n\n**Buy, Sell, Hold?**\n\nIf you’re convinced Tesla is a tech company, buy and hold. If you think Tesla is very much a car company and will continue to be so, sell. Initially I viewed Tesla as a tech company since they seem to be working on more than just cars, but so far it seems their main business is and will continue to be car manufacturing.", "id": "10me7yx", "created_utc": 1674801072.0, "score": 8, "upvote_ratio": 0.72, "num_comments": 70, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|48|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|5 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\n ^^[**Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse) ^^[BanBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/banbets/)  ^^VoteBot ^^[FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/votebot/) ^^[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/leaderboard/) ^^- ^^[**Keep_VM_Alive**](https://www.patreon.com/visualmod)\n>TL;DR: Tesla is a car company.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": ">I'm going to go ahead and say sell.", "score": 7, "replies": []}, {"body": "False.

You are barking up the wrong tree", "score": 0, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Not all data is created equal. Tesla has chosen an approach that depends on development of it's tech. Their sensor fusion collects 2D data and then stiches it together with RADAR data to create a 3D map, or something similar. They are banking on / developing tech that can convert this to a true 3d map, so that the car can \"see\" everything around it.\n\nAlmost every other tech company uses LIDAR, which literally creates a 3d map of everything around it, and then fuses 2d camera data to create a 360 view of the surrounding map. The difference is critical. Raw data in 2d vs 3d form is like you viewing the world with just one eye versus 2. Depth perception requires calculation vs depth perception being raw data.\n\nYou can detect an obstacle based on it's LIDAR capture, even if the computer vision does not recognize what it's  \"looking' at.  You have lesser glare issues, and a more reliable data link in the sensor fusion chain. i.e. If 2 cameras fail spontaneously, the car is not driving partially blind, and the neural network does not \"fail\", simply becomes less accurate, with several fail safe's in place.\n\nSo, in the hypothetical situation of a TSLA driving into a wall because of weird camera angle and glare issues, a LIDAR equipped vehicle would have raw data to know where an obstacle is, even if it does not know \"what\" it is. It may still crash into it, but the odds that it does not are significantly higher.\n\nSo, even though a lot of these companies may have lesser data, it's of a higher quality. Tesla's advantage  becomes clear if they have a 1000x data collection advantage. But everyone else is catching up. And a 50/100x data advantage can be overcome by having drastically higher quality data, provided TSLA does not advance their tech so as to nullify the quality issues.\n\nFurther, for all it's glory, Autopilot is still considered a LVL 3 system. So is GM Super cruise. And whatever Mercedes calls it's system. While Tesla has decided to go at Lvl 4 autonomy alone, most car manufacturers are partnering with a group of tier one OE suppliers (such as Bosch) and companies like Mobileye.\n\nHere's Mobileye launching a Lvl 4 pilot with Sixt in Germany.[https://www.mobileye.com/blog/self-driving-robotaxi-sixt-germany-iaa/](https://www.mobileye.com/blog/self-driving-robotaxi-sixt-germany-iaa/)\n\nAlmost all luxury brands have the equivalent of a Summon / Valet feature wit automated parking. That's not a result of everyone spontaneously developing it in the same year. It's BOSCH's valet system that they've incorporated.\n\nWhen one / two of these suppliers succeed, everyone will get it, and then they will likely collect more data in their first 2 years than TSLA has in it's lifetime. Simply because of scale. And then the data advantage goes away. Of course, these cars will look ugly because LIDARS are big, heavy and hard to design into an aerodynamic shape like the sexy looking Model S.\n\nIt's hard to convince someone to buy a 60K car when it looks like the google Waymo van. Much easier for a cab / rental / Uber to do so.\n\nI expect that before we see self driving cars, we will see self driving trucks. Long haul and middle mile delivery solutions. For example, a Boeing factory in Arizona that requires 10 engines a day from Texas is a much simpler problem to solve than your average driving habits. And these can run continuously 24 hours a day. UPS and amazon long haul trucking between distribution centers, and so on.

They were burning cash for years before they finally became profitable (I invested in TSLA back in 2015 and it was a bit of a long shot play back then).  Comparing TSLA cars to APPL smartphones is a stretch, there's some similarities for sure, but there's some fundamental differences that make the comparison not work well. For one, APPL was a well established tech company when they came out with the iPhone. The iPhone and the smartphone revolution it brought in, completely changed the concept of owning a phone and significantly changed the way we interact with out phones and the digital space. TSLA doesn't really change the concept of cars - a TSLA car basically works the same way as any other car, there's no paradigm shift in transportation. For several years after its first release, iPhones made some major strides in their technology, while a TSLA from 2012 is more or less the same as a TSLA you can buy today.  \n\n\nTSLAs are still very popular, and I'm sure they'll be EV leader for at least the next few years, but I'm seeing significantly more non-TSLA EVs on the road, and most of them don't even look like EVs, for example, the Audi E-Tron - they look like regular Audis.   \n\n\nHonestly, the fact the the Mach-E isn't profitable for Ford probably won't kill Ford's push towards developing their EVs, because they know it's going to be the future.

Once the luster of owning a Tesla wears off on people, the Model 3 and Y will need to compete with comparable cars like the Corolla and they won't be able to charge that higher premium anymore. Also I'm not saying the Model 3 and Corolla are in the same class, I'm just using it as an example.", "score": 0, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "The way I’ve always looked at it is like this. You compare Ford and GM because they are the same. They have similar margins, similar debt, similar mission, and so on. Then there is tesla, they are an outlier in all cases. They make more money, have less debt, and operate differently. \n\nI also think they are a car company, because most of their revenue comes from car sales. But it doesn’t make sense to compare it to legacy, because they are different in almost every way other than they all sell cars. \n\nTesla also sells energy storage, which has been ramping extremely fast. And sees no signs of slowing down through the recession, unlike car sales. \n\nTesla also has advantages in this upcoming price war, while legacy is fighting to become profitable Tesla will be able to set (relatively) whatever price they want and still make money. More than legacy does on their ice sales.. \n\nSo in the near term, Teslas valuation may due for some downward pressure if prices need to keep dropping. But longterm there’s a maturing EV business and a high growth higher margin energy business ramping. And there’s a slim chance legacy performs better than tesla over then next few years, higher chance that legacy slips more and tesla picks up the slack.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Great points. I don’t agree with your assessment on legacy auto not catching up, but it isn’t a foregone conclusion that they will either.

The only reason I’d even suggest that some wont make it is profitability, non of them are posting their vehicle margins so clearly there’s nothing to brag about. It’s almost certain than most of them are losing money on every EV. GM says 2025 for profitability, that’s scary even if accurate because we don’t know how profitable that will be. \n\nWill 5% margins in EVs be enough to offset dropping ICE sales ? What’s gonna happen to all the unused factories given the shift to more efficient larger output factories? Stacking more debt to retool / rebuild ev factories..\n\nLegacy just has a lot to go up against, and they don’t have the advantage of small fast steps.
