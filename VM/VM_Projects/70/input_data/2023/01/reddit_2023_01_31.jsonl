AMD’s estimate suggests a 10% decline in sales in the current quarter. It also said it expected its adjusted gross margin to be about 50%, a key metric for chipmakers like AMD.\n\nAMD reported earnings as many of its rival chipmakers have stumbled in recent weeks, citing lower consumer demand for finished electronics and gluts of parts needed to make PCs and servers. Intel, AMD’s primary competitor, reported a disastrous quarter last week that included a weak 2023 outlook.\n\nWhile AMD said it saw slow sales for its PC chips and graphics processors, it said its data center segment rose 42% year-over-year, suggesting it took market share from Intel.\n\nAMD attributed its beat to strong growth in its embedded and data center businesses, and said that its client revenue, or chips for PCs and laptops, and its gaming segment were down.\n\nAMD’s data center segment rose 42% year-over-year to $1.7 billion. Its embedded segment grew 1,868%, AMD said, because of sales from its purchase of Xilinx.\n\nAMD’s gaming business, which is comprised of graphics cards and chips for gaming consoles, was down 7% year-over-year. The decrease came from graphics cards and was offset by “semi-custom” revenue, which is what the company calls its chips for systems like the PlayStation 5.", "id": "10qb2lq", "created_utc": 1675200555.0, "score": 366, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 78, "comments": [{"body": "AMD inching closer to INTC every quarter.", "score": 119, "replies": [{"body": "[removed]", "score": -39, "replies": [{"body": "Please, do elaborate.", "score": 11, "replies": []}, {"body": "Maybe those INTC bags are blinding you", "score": 21, "replies": [{"body": "maybe those AMD and INTC bags are blinding you.", "score": -29, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "Pretty good all considered.

AMD's annual EPS is 3.50 / share.

The main entrant that is becoming a viable competitor is ARM. More so that the hyperscalers are developing their own in-house version.\n\nI believe there is 2 reasons to that: 1) they realize chips are the future, and the investment they make relative to the returns makes it worthwhile. Also they don't need a fab themselves, there's a third party fab that has more advanced working technology than Intel. Furthermore, customized chips may differentiate themselves and offer better competitive performance.\n\n2) hyperscalers can use their own in-house version to keep third-party chip prices down. Let's say AMD completely outcompetes Intel. Then AMD becomes the next monopoly. A monopoly over the CPU which is the heart of servers, in a world dependent on datacenters. There's no guarantee AMD won't do the same as Intel. So if the hyperscalers have a good enough chip, that can serve to deter exorbitant prices.\n\n3 years ago, I felt x86 was pretty much the only game, and there's only 2 players--Intel and AMD. 3 years later, I realized that the datacenter is changing so fast that x86 may no longer be the only game.
