Please spare me the comparisons to legacy OEMs. It only tells me that you can‚Äôt read financial statements. But the bear arguments really did hold water when the market cap was $1T and the stock was basically priced for flawless execution until 2027 in the great asset bubble of 2021. Elon dumping shares? Yep, definitely not great for the share price. Elon running Twitter? I‚Äôll concede that point too. But at these forward EPS multiples, the bear thesis has pretty much priced it all in. So let me lay out the bull case for this year.\n\n-Demand: Pretty much all the bears could talk about in Q4. Demand concerns and ‚Äúcompetition‚Äù. Welp, Tesla just solved that problem and then some by cutting prices back to 2019 levels and taking full advantage of all the new tax credits to help offset the hit to margins. Are there extra cost savings and economies of scale coming from Austin/Berlin/4680? Quite probable. Does anything exist like that for Ford, GM, VW, Toyota? No. Can Ford, GM, VW, Toyota afford to cut prices? Also no.\n\n-Tesla Energy: The Lathrop plant is currently ramping and will have a capacity that is 20x larger than the nearest US competitor‚ÄîFluence. IRA incentives are driving huge growth in grid tied storage. I would expect this to be addressed on the upcoming earnings call, but early estimates project 30-50% margins on Megapacks @zerosumgame33 has done great DD on this on Twitter. Energy is not currently incorporated into many Wall St estimates, so this would be a surprise to the upside that is almost entirely unaccounted for by analysts.\n\n-Cybertruck launch, semi-ramp: Really not much else to add. Breaking into new vehicle segments and taking market share.\n\n-Elon hiring Twitter CEO: Lots of folks not happy with the Twitter distraction and the dumping of Tesla shares, including me. So again, this is pretty straightforward. More Elon time spent at Tesla and less selling of Tesla stock.\n\n-Share buyback: This has probably turned into more of a question mark as of late, but it was brought up on the Q3 earnings call as a possibility since Tesla is sitting on a pile of cash. The recent price cuts would probably call this into question though. \n\n-Vehicle refreshes: Model S/3/X are all due for design refreshes. Probably not much coming from an aesthetic standpoint, but underneath the skin Tesla is likely going to incorporate more castings and engineering improvements to continue reducing parts and cutting manufacturing costs. Adding 4680 and structural battery packs to these vehicles will cut costs even further. \n\nBears made a lot of noise in ‚Äò22, but I just don‚Äôt see it working out for them this year.
