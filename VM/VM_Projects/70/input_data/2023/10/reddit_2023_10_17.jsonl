Factories will require union workers, iterative improvements to manufacturing and the factory to reduce costs and labor might be frowned upon, possibly the end of Optimus/AI development for factory work, cutting margins to zero or below to pay workers and bring back pensions, retaliation if union workers get laid off, and overall higher prices for consumers to survive and pay the UAW tax.\n\nI support some unions and work councils (illegal in the US), but the UAW is a corrupt cancer.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "So, like a cancer, can they just close the UAW plant if they ever voted for it at a Tesla plant?

Like requiring \"X%\" of a product to be made in the US, for example, or requiring assembly to be in the US. (again, these stipulations were fought for by unions, since it would be cheaper to just make every aspect of a vehicle overseas and just ship it over.)\n\nThis includes protections again retaliation when people try to unionize. \n\nFuck man, do you really think ANY manufacturing would exist in the US without protections largely fought by unions when it would be cheaper in almost every single instance to manufacture stuff elsewhere? (outside of highly technical specifications)\n\nYou can still make an affordable car and pay your workers to have a solid middle class life. (a house, 2 cars, paying for multiple kids to go to college, and a vacation home all on a single salary was the expectation for a middle class life in the 80s and 90s).

So when we are talking about plants that produce millions of dollars of parts a day, you are talking about costs that run into the billions for then making another plant elsewhere, which ALSO has a good chance of being unionized once it's formed.\n\nPlants that are not unionized only stay that way when their pay and benefits match those of their unionized counterparts.
