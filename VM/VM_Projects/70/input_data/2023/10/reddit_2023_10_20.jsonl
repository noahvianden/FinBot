As that happens rates will come down. It's mathematically impossible to have rates like we had decades ago with debt to GDP where it is.

From a societal perspective, the only way to \"print money\" is to create value. The dollar is just a physical embodiment of the concept of appreciation. I.e. you give me an apple, and I appreciate it, so I give you a dollar so you can use my appreciation elsewhere. By increasing interest rates, the Fed is just burning dollars by reducing the M2 money supply. That value is taken from borrowers and redistributed to cash holders. There is definitely an initial \"shock\", but all that can happen is the Fed keeps funneling value to cash holders by siphoning it from borrowers which they can do in perpetuity, but borrowers will eventually reach an equilibrium. The only \"shock\" is from the change in rates which causes borrowers to wind down those debt positions. In order to pay off those debts, they need to provide value to cash holders and collect that cash to close their debts. \n\nSo there actually is a \"*reason to think people will get used to higher rates and slower growth any faster.*\" Getting used to lower interest rates takes a lot more time because people are not forced into action. I'm not forced to borrow when rates are 0%. Getting used to higher rates works differently because as rates go up, more and more people are forced to pay off their debts. I cannot afford to pay 10% interest on my mortgage, so once rates hit 10% I have sell my house and buy something cheaper. \n\nThe only way around that is if I can get someone else to give me a guaranteed rate of 8%. That person is betting that high rates won't stick around long and then I'll be paying them 8% when Fed rate is 2%. However, there are only so many banks that will take that bet and give me the fixed rate and as the Fed rate goes up, fewer and fewer people are going to be willing to give me an 8% fixed rate (if Fed rate is 50%, no one will give me an 8% fixed rate).", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I started writing out a response, but it became a wall of text.

Higher rates ensure a higher demand for treasuries, which means that budget needs can be more likely met without QE or austerity. I think it could be argued that these higher rates were needed even beyond getting inflation down, for potentially avoiding a painful recession. In many ways it seems quite healthy for money to flow from an overheated stock market full of meme stocks, to treasuries.\n\nThere are frequently claims about the effect of interest rates being about to ‚Äúbreak things‚Äù, and to me it just seems like regurgitated stuff, I don‚Äôt see much backing this up.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "The problem isn't the rate\n\nThe problem is the idiots who bought trillions of bonds at 1%", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Rate of change is the issue.

Buy lube and a heart monitor. Lessons learned 1. If your position goes against you, sell early. Look for a re entry once it‚Äôs settled. 2. Study technical analysis. 3. Average in to a position.  4 hedge against yourself, go Long on the spot price and go Short on the future price. Watch the charts and when you see it‚Äôs bottomed out or topped out, sell the one in the green and wait for the retracement of the other side in red. If you have crazy ballz you can take the money from the assets you just sold and double down on the assets in the red(high risk) so you are able to recovery the position in the Red faster without the price going back to where you had originally bought. High risk, but you can make money that way. Don‚Äôt take you eyes off the screen and be careful when pending economic news is coming out ( pmi, employment data, rate decisions, Fed talk etc‚Ä¶ ) those events kill technical analysis. I prefer using this strategy for Forex, or commodities. 5. Never keep a position open over the weekend (NEVER). You can sleep without worrying about your open position. 6. The market is rigged, so whatever you may have learned in economics is worthless. Understand Geo politics.  7. Never go all into a position, keep some dry powder. If a position goes against you, you are not automatically in margin call. The company providing you access to the platform is not your friend, they Will margin call you quick time. Remember they take the opposite position of yours,so if you‚Äôre in the red; they‚Äôre in the Green. 8 use stop losses, but not tight ones. Big players spike the market prices to trigger people‚Äôs stop loss setting. I call that shaking the Tree. 9. Stay humble remember you are a little lizard trying to catch flies in a lion‚Äôs den, get in get your fill and get out. 10. Most important one. HE WHO SELLS AND GOES AWAY LIVES TO BUY ANOTHER DAY.
