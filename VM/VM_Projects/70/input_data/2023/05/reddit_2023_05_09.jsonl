{"title": "Monthly Wheel Update", "selftext": "Hi all. Thought I'd continue my monthly updates for those interested...\n\nIf you're curious about my previous update you can find it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/12cu5e5/march_monthly_update/). \n\nIn April I closed 17 positions with an average DTE of 21 days for $4,997 in premiums. I was not assigned any positions this month. \n\nThis brings my total premiums collected to $57,280 since September of 2022. I have $18,000 in unrealized losses (mostly in CRWD, TSLA and FUBO) so my total gain is $39,280 in the past 8 months.\n\nAccount size 300k, which gives me a 13% return. Spy in the same time frame is up 4%. \n\nHere are my trades since I last posted. Some positions have been closed in this first week of may (SHOP shares called away) but I didn't add those to the April monthly gain, those will be in next months update. \n\nFeedback and critique is always welcome. Enjoy :)\n\n[Trades since last post](https://preview.redd.it/ynpkplphvqya1.jpg?width=920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4da5875faf9450ff596127260db9bb8716ee23d4)", "id": "13ch5kj", "created_utc": 1683612127.0, "score": 117, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 74, "comments": [{"body": "How are you deciding capital allocation.

The wheel includes selling puts and then CCs if assigned.  \n\nWith puts they can be cash secured with the full amount of the stock cost, ex. a $50 stock would cost $5000 if assigned as the risk, but this would only occur if the stock went to zero which rarely happens.\n\nCCs also have the full cost of the shares, but in both cases the risk is much lower as stocks often drop by some amount and then come back up for a profit.\n\nSome can sell puts for about a 10% to 20% of the share cost, ex. the $5K would be $500 to $1K in capital buying power held.  This is because the broker knows the stocks will rarely drop to zero and since the account has margin an assignment can usually be accepted.  \n\nTo determine risk most use the lower buying power amount as most will not drop that low.  In the end, the risk is based on the stock and company being traded.  AAPL and other blue chips will have a very low risk.  FUBO and other companies that are losing money and on the brink of going bankrupt like BBBY recently did would have much higher risk . . .", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks u/ScottishTrader!  I'd like to get a better sense of the risks involved using wheels.  Seems like we could compute the risk of selling the puts and the CCs separately in a rolling or sequential manner as a function of stock price.

When I sell a CSP I'm of the mindset that I am ok owning that company at that strike price and will hold if need be. If the company goes under then my analysis was incorrect and I accept the 100% loss at that point.

This would be some kind of standard deviation, right?  \n\nThe risk is the delta probabilities for the put.  A .30 delta put would be about a 30% probability of being ITM for a loss.
