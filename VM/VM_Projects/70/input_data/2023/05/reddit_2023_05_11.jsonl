Why is that important? PPI leads CPI, it is the actual primary gauge of inflation (contrary to popular belief), as producer's prices trickle down to consumers eventually.\n\nNow, taking into account that the CPI STILL came in relatively hot for the FED to get comfortable with current market conditions, and the potential for the PPI to come in hotter than expected (which is very plausible considering the ISM Manufacturing Prices reported on the 1st of May is the HIGHEST it has been in months), it might be the push the markets need to price in more rate hikes.\n\nThe technicals also make sense, as Gold (the primary hedge against inflation) is somehow holding its own considering yesterday's equity pump, and the DXY is also bottoming out.\n\nIt's gonna be a fun day!", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "QQQ's moving averages are climbing but MACD and RSI are sinking.
