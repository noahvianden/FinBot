{"title": "What I'm doing for PLTR earnings tonight", "selftext": "Today after-hours, Palantir is reporting latest earnings. Analysts are predicting earnings of $0.040 per share compared to earnings of $0.020 per share in the same quarter of the previous year. They're also expecting the company to report $505.8 million, an increase of 13.32% over the prior year quarter. Looking at the full year, analysts expect a profit of $0.207 per share. In the previous year there was a profit of $0.060 per share.\n\nOver the last 2 years, PLTR has beaten EPS estimates 50% of the time and has beaten revenue estimates 100% of the time. Over the last 3 months, EPS estimates have seen 4 upward revisions and 3 downward. Revenue estimates have seen 1 upward revision and 7 downward.\n\nThe data intelligence software company in mid February reported Q4 2022 results that beat estimates on both top- and bottom-line. The company also [forecasted](https://www.reuters.com/technology/palantir-expects-2023-be-first-profitable-year-sees-ai-driving-growth-2023-02-13/) 2023 to be its first year of profitability, sending its shares higher by more than 20%. I do expect the company to move towards sustainable operating profitability, especially with the recently announced [expansion](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/pltr-stock-palantir-expands-microsoft-cloud-computing-pact-to-government-agencies/) of the company's cloud partnership with Microsoft (MSFT), which opens up a new revenue source.\n\nHowever, PLTR shares have struggled since the company's strong Q4 report, having fallen about 20% up till their last close. In addition to this, the company in late February joined the string of technology firms that announced layoffs amid an economic slowdown. PLTR said it would reduce its workforce by around 2% in an effort to reduce costs. However, this isn't necessarily bad news.  Citi on Thursday said PLTR is likely to keep dealing with challenges posed by \"incremental commercial headwinds,\" despite \"resilient\" spending from the federal government.\n\n**What to do for earnings?**\n\nPLTR has moved on average 4% with earnings, but with a large standard deviation. I don't think there's sufficient news to predict whether it'll go up or down with any degree of confidence. However, due to low strike prices, options are really cheap. I'm picking up 5/12 8p at 58 bucks a pop. If the stock were to drop 4%, that wouldn't be a big enough move to deem the puts profitable. However, I'm treating this as a lotto play, hoping for a larger move downward; while not exactly 'expecting' it.
