The process usually involves the following steps:\r  \n•\tEmployee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP): Some companies offer an ESPP that allows employees to purchase company stock at a discounted price. If the company has such a plan, employees can enroll in it and set aside a portion of their salary to be used for purchasing the stock.\r  \n•\tBrokerage Account: Employees need to have a brokerage account to buy and sell stocks.\r  \n\r  \nCompanies typically partner with specific brokerage companies to facilitate their Employee Stock Purchase Plans (ESPPs). While there isn't a definitive list of the most commonly used brokerage companies for ESPPs, several well-known firms are often chosen for their comprehensive services and expertise in corporate stock plan administration. Some of the popular brokerage companies used for ESPPs include:\r  \n\r  \n1.\tFidelity Investments: Fidelity is a leading brokerage firm that offers a wide range of services, including ESPP administration. They have a dedicated team to handle corporate stock plans and provide online tools and resources for employees to manage their ESPP accounts.\r  \n2.\tCharles Schwab: Charles Schwab is a well-established brokerage firm that offers ESPP services to companies. They provide online platforms for employees to access their ESPP accounts, view stock purchase details, and manage transactions.\r  \n3.\tMorgan Stanley: Morgan Stanley is a renowned financial services firm that offers comprehensive stock plan administration services. They work with companies to manage their ESPPs and provide employees with access to account information and trading tools.\r  \n\n\n**Vesting Periods**\n\nThere are usually vesting periods associated with an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP). Vesting refers to the process by which an employee gains ownership rights over the employer-provided contributions or benefits, such as company stock, over a specific period of time. Vesting periods are designed to incentivize employee loyalty and retention.\r  \nThe specific vesting schedule can vary depending on the company and the terms of the ESPP. It is typically determined by the plan rules and is communicated to employees when they enroll in the program. Some common vesting schedules include:\r  \n\r  \n•\tGraded Vesting: Graded vesting is a common approach where the ownership of the purchased stock is gradually acquired over a specified period of time. For example, an ESPP might have a four-year graded vesting schedule with 25% vesting each year. This means that after one year, an employee will have vested 25% of the purchased stock, and by the end of the fourth year, they will have vested the entire amount.\r  \n•\tCliff Vesting: Cliff vesting involves a waiting period before any stock ownership is acquired, followed by full vesting at a specific point in time. For example, an ESPP might have a cliff vesting period of three years, after which employees become fully vested.\n\n\r  \n**If an employee gets laid off**  \n\n\nIf an employee gets laid off from a company before their Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) is fully vested, what happens to the stocks that were purchased depends on the specific terms outlined in the ESPP and the company's policies. Here are a few possible scenarios:\r  \n•\tGraded Vesting: If the ESPP has a graded vesting schedule, the employee may have already vested a portion of the purchased stocks based on the completed vesting periods. In this situation, the vested shares would typically remain with the employee, and they would retain ownership of those shares. However, the unvested shares that were not yet earned would be forfeited back to the company upon the layoff.\r  \n•\tCliff Vesting: In the case of cliff vesting, if the layoff occurs before the cliff vesting period is completed, the employee typically forfeits all the unvested shares and does not retain any ownership rights to those shares.\r  \nIt's important to note that the specific details regarding what happens to the purchased stocks upon a layoff can vary depending on the company's policies and the terms of the ESPP. Employees should carefully review the ESPP documents and consult with the company's HR department or the plan administrator to understand the implications of a layoff on their vested and unvested shares.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Stock reinvestment dept.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "What’s the status on this?", "score": -7, "replies": []}, {"body": "Have you heard of lawyers?

Two relative upstarts, INTC and WMT, more than 10x'd during than same period of time.  You hate Cathy Wood because someone told you too and you listened.  She's hit and miss with her picks and mostly made a name for herself because of her blind commitment to 'growth stories' during periods where it was rewarded.  When the eventual Fed pivot takes place, and the growth narrative takes place again, ARKK will be a great place to have cash parked.
