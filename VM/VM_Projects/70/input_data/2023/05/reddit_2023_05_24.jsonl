So, you're talking about inference as being a very large opportunity. I guess, two sub parts to that.

Fact: inferencing‚Äôs going to be huge and here nvidia has weak moat.

For that reason the way forward for nvidia has to be software and saas.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": ">Don‚Äôt you think this avoids the question?\n\nSure it does.   I've been listening to these ERs for 15 years and he's been consistent all that time.   Straight forward questions never get answered, from Colette either.   It's just like politics, answer the question you want to answer, not the one asked.\n\nBut weak moat?\n\nJoseph Moore\n\nGreat. Thank you. I want to follow-up on that, in terms of the focus on inference. It's pretty clear that this is a really big opportunity around large language models, but the cloud customers are also talking about trying to reduce cost per query by very significant amounts. You can talk about the ramifications of that for you guys, is that where some of the specialty insurance products that you launched at GTC come in and just how are you going to help your customers get the cost per query down?\n\nJensen Huang\n\nYeah. That's a great question. Whether your -- you start by building a large language model and you use that large language model very large version and you could distill them into medium, small and tiny size. And the tiny sized ones, you can put in your phone and your PC and so on and so forth and they all have good -- they all have -- it seems surprising, but they all can do the same thing. But obviously, the zero shot or the generalizeability of the large language model, the biggest one is much more versatile and it can do a lot more amazing things. And the large one would teach the smaller ones, how to be good AIs and so, you use the large one to generate prompts to align the smaller ones and so on and so forth. And so you start by building very large ones. And then you also have to train a whole bunch of smaller ones.Now, that's exactly the reason why we have so many different sizes of our inference \\[solution\\]. You saw that I announced L4, L40, H100 NBL -- which also have H100 HGX and then we have H100 multi-node with NVLink and so there is -- you could have model sizes of any kind that you like. The other thing that's important is, these are models, but they are connected ultimately to applications. And the applications could have image in, video out, video in, text out, image in, proteins out, text in, 3D out, video in, in the future, 3D graphics out.So, the input and the output requires a lot of pre and post-processing. The pre and post-processing can't be ignored. And this is one of the things that most of the specialized chip arguments fall apart and it's because the length -- the model itself is only call it 25% of the data -- of the overall processing of inference. The rest of it is about preprocessing and post-processing, security, decoding, all kinds of things like that.And so, I think the multimodality aspect of inference, the multi diversity of inference, that it's going to be done in the Cloud on-prem. It's going to be done in multi-cloud, that's the reason why we have the AI Enterprise in all the clouds. It's going to be done on-prem, it's the reason why we have a great partnership with Dell we just announced the other day, called project Helix, that's going to be integrated into third-party services. That's the reason why we have a great partnership with ServiceNow, and Adobe, because they're going to be creating a whole bunch of generative AI capabilities. And so, there's all the diversity, and the reach of generative AI is so broad, you need to have some very fundamental capabilities like what I just described, in order to really address the whole space of it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe's doesn't care about handheld and PC at this point.

The reason they can't unseat Nvidia is because  \"hardware + software =  solution platform\" problem.   \n\nThey're fighting against a platform with a chip.   It's near impossible (perhaps until a revolutionary shift in technology comes along). \n\nTo think that, oh, okay. . .  NOW.    What happened before today is just practice.   NOW is the time we're REALLY GOING TO START TRYING to build a better mouse trap?   It's a laughable view honestly.   \n\nExecutives, Engineers, VCs, Academics at the biggest technology companies and best schools -- they've all already put their heads in and given their best shot to date.  It's not to say they won't continue to try, but with each passing day Nvidia ML technology becomes more entrenched.  \n\nLethargic and asleep is nothing close to accurate, they've been bright and attentive and watched $Bs march right into Nvidia's coffers, powerless to put up the most modest or inadequate roadblock.\n\nBill Dalley, Nvidia's Chief Scientist, gave them all the formula in 2018 when he said competitors and startups should pick an area, a field, a specialty and concentrate on that one thing.  Become THE EXPERT in that one AI thing to establish a foothold.   We're still waiting for that or those \"one guys\" to arise and own a segment.\n\nAnd Nvidia has nothing close to 80% of inferencing market.  Most DC inferencing today is done on CPUs for recommenders for advertising (Google), storefronts (Amazon), streaming (Netflix, Spotify) etc. \n\nWhere Nvidia gets a solid foothold in inferencing is the industrial level inferencing for LLMs like CSPs use.  These models are not going to get simpler, they are going to become more complex (higher levels of compute) as they embed or are integrated with more multimodal models.\n\nBut your whole argument is self-owned when you talk about 2025, two years from now.  Two years, one chip generation, is always and exactly the runway Nvidia has had on it's competition.  It's forever in high tech hardware.    They advance and we advance, and what do you know?  The gap never closes.   An therefore competitors never gain ground on the software deliverables.\n\nAMD has this really cute habit of talking a very  confident game right up until the moment of a GPU launch, then about the time of the first 3rd party review, you can feel the momentum shift and disgust hits when the outlook changes to, \"we'll get 'em with the next gen.\"  I nearly guarantee that's what happens with MI300.

Fact is nvidia is pursuing edge inferencing. Edge inferencing will take share from cloud inferencing, that's how these things work. But edge inferencing isn't even the crux of my concern, it's more of the weakening of the moat over time due to interpolable open standards leading to commoditization.\n\n> You seem to imply the data center AI infrastructure Jensen is going after is meaningless.\n\nIf I talk about a concern I have or something negative do I have to present it as a compliment sandwich? As I explained previously I'm someone who assumes NVDA will be worth a trillion, or even several trillions within the next couple of years. Obviously, that's going to come from being very successful in DC and elsewhere, it seems strange that I would have to explain this in every conversation. But on this forum, assuming I'm talking to other longs I only find it really worthwhile to talk about the negatives because the positives are assumed. This is not a shilling exercise for me.\n\n> And Nvidia has nothing close to 80% of inferencing market. Most DC inferencing today is done on CPUs for recommenders for advertising (Google), storefronts (Amazon), streaming (Netflix, Spotify) etc.\n\nI'm not sure if you're aware but the majority of recommenders today don't even use ML. Because guess what... CPUs are slow as hell. Nvidia absolutely has 80% of the accelerated inferencing market currently.\n\n> Man, what ever you're smoking must be good. Once they really try hard?

It's not to say they won't continue to try, but with each passing day Nvidia ML technology becomes more entrenched.\n\nUp to now the vast majority of the ecosystem has been investing INTO the nvidia stack and NOT trying to compete with it (except for google who has a successful alternative). Obviously, this will continue to a large extent but investment into alternatives is only just beginning. If you seriously don't see this year as an inflection point I question your news.\n\nI also question if you've actually groked the new information you got a month ago, the one where you acknowledged that Google's AI runs on TPUs and not GPUs? \n\n> But your whole argument is self-owned when you talk about 2025, two years from now. Two years, one chip generation, is always and exactly the runway Nvidia has had on it's competition. It's forever in high tech hardware. They advance and we advance, and what do you know?

An therefore competitors never gain ground on the software deliverables.\n\nGoogle literally already has closed the what-gap, there never was a gap, or are you still in denial about this? It is not necessary to beat NVIDIA on the benchmarks, it just needs to be cheaper, that's it. NVIDIA has very fat margins and I don't want to see that compress. It feels like in your head you're still competing with AMD or something, the competition is with Meta, who made PyTorch, and MS, who owns ChatGPT. This ain't the little leagues anymore.\n\n> The largest technology companies on earth have been trying to dethrone NVDA's ML platform for nearly 10 years, certainly with enthusiasm and large capital outlays since 2016. The reason they can't unseat Nvidia is because \"hardware + software = solution platform\" problem.\n\nThis is misleading... I've been pounding this for months now. NVIDIA has some software and a platform, not the ONLY platform. The owner of PyTorch can easily (for them) support other hardware, and this will absolutely get done once the Meta hardware is complete. \n\n> Where Nvidia gets a solid foothold in inferencing is the industrial level inferencing for LLMs like CSPs use. These models are not going to get simpler, they are going to become more complex (higher levels of compute) as they embed or are integrated with more multimodal models.\n\nYes nvidia's going to do very well since the market is huge and expanding, but we are definitely going to experience severe marketshare losses over the next 3 years, this is basically guaranteed. I'm calling it now, Athena, and Meta's solutions, are going to be successful and they will replace NVIDIA internally much like how TPUs have replaced NVIDIA for internal use at Google. Check back in 2 years you can take this to the bank.\n\n> AMD has this really cute habit of talking a very confident game right up until the moment of a GPU launch, then about the time of the first 3rd party review, you can feel the momentum shift and disgust hits when the outlook changes to, \"we'll get 'em with the next gen.\" I nearly guarantee that's what happens with MI300.
