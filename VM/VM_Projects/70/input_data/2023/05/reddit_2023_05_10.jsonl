The 1 to 2 percent inflation is a made up number that started in New Zealand by an official during the 90s i think it was who said he only said that number because he was put on the spot while he was being questioned. If possible he would rather inflation be zero but governments can't help themselves so of course it won't be zero so 1 to 2 percent while not desirable is tolerable.

If you believe in the Fed money printer theory, the argument is that all that money artificially propped up demand, causing an imbalance with supply.  There is surely some validity to that argument, as well as the fact that supply took a hit due to shutdowns.  And, we have also had dramatic shifts in the labor market.

If you really want to be technical the original definition of inflation is an increase in the money supply and the Fed is the only one who has control over that. The people have nothing to do with it. It's interesting how the most famous examples that are always mentioned when changes in currency occur is Weimar Germany, Zimbabwe, Argentina and Venezuela and in every case inflation is the reason for the problem.

Either demand falls, most likely due to a recession, which nobody will be happy about (except short sellers).

If your contention is the Fed should decrease the money supply to make prices drop, that will also likely trigger a recession as banks will have less money to lend, and people will have less money in general (lower demand).
