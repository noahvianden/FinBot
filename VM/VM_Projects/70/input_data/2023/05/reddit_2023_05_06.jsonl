{"title": "Tesla Vs Competition", "selftext": "First of all, I understand I may be beating a dead horse here, so I apologize. I also know Tesla is a highly polarizing stock to discuss. I have made money and lost money on Tesla in the past and I am currently trying to be as non-bias as possible and want to ensure I am understanding correctly.\n\nAs everyone knows, Tesla is priced at a dramatically higher price than it's competitors, with many saying it is all due to hype (which very well could be possible). From my understanding, although Tesla is involved in solar to some capacity, around 90+% of Tesla revenue comes from vehicle sales (I believe the number is 93% vehicle sales). \n\nI do understand that Tesla was essentially \"the first\" big name in electric vehicles, giving them a first mover advantage. Anecdotally, I see an insane number of them on the road compared to any other EV. However, most auto makers are moving into the EV space. Based on online reviews I have read, other automakers vehicles are more reliable and better in a lot of areas comparatively to Tesla. \n\nAdditionally, I have heard of Tesla having long standing quality control issues. To my knowledge, the model 3 is the most affordable electric EV with the technology currently available, but even that has some issues, such as \"full self driving\" not really being full self driving and most competitors having similar systems that can do most of what the FSD can do.\n\nI do find Tesla as a whole very fascinating (if anything, as a case study of how quick a company can grow and to the level it has). In a way, I really want Tesla to win and be this awesome, futuristic if you will, vehicle unlike anything we have seen. I was a Tesla bull for a long time, but recently have been thinking deeper into this and now trying be as unbiased as possible. I have learned more about competitors and pushes further doubts into my mind. I have heard really terrific things about the Mach E Mustang for example, with it beating Tesla in several categories, just as one example here.\n\nWith that said, what is the unbiased bull and bear case for Tesla? What is a genuine reason it can be priced so much higher than it's competitors outside of hype, or is it just that, hype? Is the first mover advantage just being displayed to an insane level and it will surely not last?  I'm extremely curious as to everyone's opinions and what you have to say!

Below are just some points as to why I am buy a lot of this stock.\n\n1. Tesla was the company that popularize EV, and it has a good head start because ford/GM decided to abandon the first ev project. They were the true pioneer, but for some reason quit.\n2. Tesla tax break in the US which help reduce the cost of the car. At the moment, Tesla is is the cheapest EV car you can buy due to government's subsidies and the current relation automakers have with the auto sellers. Additionally, when you compound this with the cost of markup, it is very easy to understand why you are seeing more Tesla. Last summer, I wanted to buy a Mach E, but when I wen to the dealer, there was a $15,000 markup on top of MSRP. My family ended up getting another Tesla (model y) because it is the value. Have you tried purchasing the EV F-150 that you can find? There is a motherfucking $30,000 markup at the dealer. it's insane.\n3. As for build quality, I can tell you that after owning 3 Tesla, it is a hit or miss with this company. However, I can also say the same for other car makers. You are going to run into defects. Nevertheless, do you know why many people still prefer a Tesla over other brands? Tesla will fix all of the defects of their cars for free--3 years warranty--and give you a $100/day uber allowance for the trouble. Even if you are out of warranty, they will fix some defects for free too. For the simple stuff, they will send someone out to wherever your car is to fix the problem. In contrast with other automakers/dealers, they nickel and dime you for everything that they can. \n4. Tesla are amazing car to drive. The handling and speed is the best bang for the buck you can get. There is something about the car that feel good. \n5. Tesla doesn't just sell car. Tesla sale insurance, power(supercharger), car repair, and charging format. It is cheaper to insure a Tesla through their insurance than to another insurance. They have the most charging stations in the world which is one of the reasons why government are asking them to share their charging station with other makers. Tesla is agreeing with this because there is current a format war for charging adapters. There are currently 4-5 format (think USB vs thunderbolt plug), and it looks like Tesla is winning even though there are faster and better charging adapters. The best and cheapest place to repair your Tesla is at a Tesla location. In short, they are the monopoly for their car.\n6. It doesn't help that the current charging station for other car companies are poorly maintained and frustrating to use. Tesla makes it very easy to charge at their station. Get in and get out. Plus they are always functioning because people are always using them. \n7. The current sentiment for the Asian culture (Chinese, Vietnamese, Korean, etc.) is Tesla is a luxury brand car--beating Lexus. Ever noticed how almost every middle class Vietnamese or Chinese drive an RX 300 series? Well, now they are driving Tesla. This is the reason why you are seeing such huge spike in Tesla sales in China. \n8. The company is purely data driving. Ask anyone who has worked for Tesla and they can tell you that the company only car about data and nothing else. Everything they do is data driven. The ups and downs of Tesla price is driven by this data. They know exactly how much people are willing to pay for the car. For example, the recent price cut is mainly to kill Tesla competitors. In a time when Tesla is making $20,000+ profit per car, its competitors are losing $20,000 to $100,000 per car. This is insane numbers. You don't think so? Wait until this week earning for Tesla's competitors, and look at how Ford is losing money per ev car. \n9. Elon Musk is a dick, but you cannot argue against his killer instinct when it comes to how he run Tesla. The decision to dump millions into building charging station for free and giving early adopters free charging for the life of the car was insane at the time. However, in hindsight, those were some killer instinct decision making that made Tesla what it is today. With that said, Elon has so much control over Tesla that he can make any changes based on the data the company is collection without the board approval. \n\nOverall, there are many reasons as to why Tesla will do well in the future and for Cathie Wood's high valuation. I know she sounds like a crazy lady sometime, but from my perspective, Tesla is building itself up to be a monopoly for EV car. This is similar to the how people adopted the Apple's ecosystem. Tesla reach the tipping point of adopters into its ecosystem, it will be interesting to see what kind of company it will be. If you think all Tesla is selling is car, I think you are missing the bigger picture. Tesla major product right now is car. However, in the next 5 years, I'm more incline to believe it will be the seller of energy (think gas for your car) than just a car company due to it winning the format war. \n\nThe only way for Tesla to lose this format war is for the majority of automaker to come together and agree upon one format for charging. However, as someone who have family members working for Hyundai, Ford, and Toyota, it is unlikely this will happen. These guys all think they can take on the EV giant because they are a legacy automaker. To me, we are looking at a transition from blackberry to Iphone, but in the form of cars. \n\nNevertheless, this isn't  to say I am a full bull of Tesla. I love the fact that people are constantly shitting on the company. This constant shitting on Tesla has created many opportunities to buy in and create incredible volatility.

What's more important is the pace of innovation, and this is where Tesla has the biggest advantage. They're improving not only their cars, but more importantly their factories at a pace that's absolutely unprecedented in the automotive industry. Where legacy OEMs are making ~40-60 changes per refresh every 1-2 years, Tesla is making that many part changes a day and they're going straight unto their production vehicles. It's an entirely different production methodology.\n\n> 2 Why is that the case? Won't other EVs in theory get to a point where the credits apply as well?\n\nThey do get the credit (although Tesla does have an advantage in terms of producing and sourcing a larger portion of their cars and batteries in the US as opposed to abroad), but they don't have dealers that will just increase the price of a car by $15K if it suits them. At Tesla customers always pay the lowest price.\n\n> 4 I suppose I should give this a shot at some point.\n\nCan confirm. Ever since I test drove a Model 3 Performance for 1 hour, I can't imagine myself buying any other brand as long as I can muster up the Tesla's sticker price.\n\nFinal piece of advice from my side since you seem genuinely interested to learn more about the company; listen to some of the interviews by the Tesla community with a guy called \"Joe Justice\". He's a bit much, but he worked at most legacy automakers before helping set up the agile structure that allows Tesla to improve their products so rapidly, and it's truly inspirational stuff. Really unique view on what makes Tesla a completely different company than any other carmaker or even most tech companies. As a business owner, it's given me a whole different perspective on what a company should aspire to achieve.", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "1. A head start is giving Tesla a huge advantage over its competitors. While many legacy automakers are trying to improve its logistic, Telsa had 10 years to figure out its logistic. If the company continue to innovate, the advantage will be come bigger.\n2. Yes, at some point every EV makers will break even on their production and will be equal to Tesla. However, this is at least 2-3 years in the making because the legacy car company are not focus on making EV. They are focus on making EV and gas car which dramatically slow them down. In my opinion, by the time they catch up to Tesla, they will start paying Tesla royalty for using the Tesla's charging adapter format. However, there is a key hurdle that automakers have to overcome with its long history with car dealers. I'm not sure if you know that but legally, many automakers cannot sell their car directly to consumers. It's in their contracts that they can only sale their cars through a dealers--at least for Hyundai because I have family members who work there. This is a current mandatory middle man, and I haven't even begin talking about the logistic and financial companies that linked with these middle men. This is an old system of selling cars back in like 1960s or something. This is one advantage that Tesla has over the legacy automakers and is one of those thing that used to be considered stupid--until it worked. Telsa are able to make huge profit of each car sale because they are selling directly to consumers. People used to shit on this and say that it wouldn't work because the automakers and dealers have an established relationship that has been working for many years. When you think about it, the auto dealers are not needed in the car selling process anymore because information can be deliver by the internet. You go look up a product that you want and then go you buy it. You don't really need someone talking to you for hours to entice you to buy xyz packages. You don't do this for any of the products you--including a house--but for some reason society used to accept that fact that it is ok for you to have a several hours conversation with a car dealer so they can try to convince to spend or buy more than you originally planned. I think this is predatory and bullshit.     \n\nThe thing with valuation is it is just a bunch of made numbers based on someone's defined rules. The current valuation is based off of a bunch of people who have deep connection with legacy automakers and are somewhat out of touch with the current and future generation of consumers. I believe Tesla valuation will go much higher as more and more earnings come out. In the mean time, it will goes down to the constant negative presses that are being released. \n\nI am deeply upset by how manipulative and predatory legacy automakers can be. Even till this day, they still think people want a car with a variety of options/addons: Toyota Camry SE, LE, XSE, XSE v6, XLE, SE Nightshade, TRD v6, and a bunch of other combinations. The various models were created to prey on people instinct to be a little different and better, even though what people really need is just a car. One of the thing that I like about a Tesla is regardless of the model you buy, the only different between a regular model 3 and a performance model 3 the battery and motor. All of the bells and whistle inside the cars are the same.  Beside from the top speed of the car and how long you can go before you have to charge it again are the only differences between Tesla models.

The legacy automakers don't make their car parts, they design them and then assemble the cars. They outsource all of the parts to subcontractors who take all of the profit margins and none of the risks. Tesla meanwhile is almost completely vertically integrated and keeps all of the profit margins for the car they produce. This means they can sell far fewer cars and make far more profit.\n\nThe second thing is that legacy automakers are legally not allowed to sell direct to consumer and have exclusive contracts with dealerships to sell their cars. This further puts constraints on their profit margins and limits their ability to adapt to market forces. Look at the last two years, dealerships were selling cars far above MSRP and the legacy automakers saw none of those additional profits. Tesla and the other new automakers have found ways around the laws against direct to consumer sales so are able to keep all of the profit margins from dealerships and get to benefit from all of the market forces that drive up prices. This is the eternal weakness of all franchise models dialed up to 11.\n\nThird, EV cars have a completely different supply chain compared to ICE cars and it is very expensive to set up, but the incremental costs are very low for manufacturing. As compared to ICE cars where most of the cost per car is in the incremental costs. Most of this is in the complexity of ICE cars compared to EVs which translates into large part counts and large labor costs for ICE cars vs. EVs. This will make it easier to fully automate an EV plant where you'll always need high skill, highly paid employees for an ICE factory.\n\nFinally, EVs companies don't have union expenses, pension expenses, legacy employer costs, etc. This adds a lot of overhead that legacy automakers have to pay that brand new companies don't.

A lot of countries are outlawing the sale of them after 2030 to 2035, but even without such laws the demand for ICE vehicles is clearly going to collapse overtime. The price of EV's has consistently gone down overtime as batteries (the biggest expense in an EV) become cheaper. And EV's have cheaper fuel than ICE vehicles. This means that sooner or later you're going to be an idiot who's throwing money away if you insist on buying an ICE vehicle when an equivalent EV is available for the same or an even cheaper upfront sticker price. Economics are going to let EV's win out.\n\nBut if you're mainly making ICE vehicles today, and aren't making a profit off of the EV's you do sell as of yet (like Ford for example) this makes transitioning to EV's very difficult. If you transition too soon you're likely going to become unprofitable (due to the loss of your profitable ICE vehicle sales) and start bleeding money. But if you transition too late, after consumer demand has shifted heavily towards EVs, then a lot of your loyal customers are going to look elsewhere when you can't provide them with an EV, so your sales (and profits) are going to plummet. Worse yet, on average it takes 3 years to bring a new vehicle model to the market, so if an automaker finds themselves in this situation they're probably already dead in the water at that point, barring a government bailout.\n\nIn my opinion at least some of the traditional automakers are almost certainly going to go bankrupt due to failing to transition to EV's.
