I believe it's maximized most of its growth cycle, therefore (unless something crazy happens), I don't see a huge change in capital gains opportunity.  \n\nGOOG - Personally, my favorite in terms of diversification of business and 'future-proofing'.  Many great technologies and ideas...but perhaps too much?  Hard to churn a profit when you're always jumping around.  However, it's a bit overvalued IMO...lots of speculation on future growth.  If it wasn't so overvalued, I would own GOOG out of all three companies.\n\nAAPL - Interestingly enough, currently a great growth AND value pick.  I believe the biggest misconception is that people value Apple was purely a 'tech' company and cite phone sales, car speculation, iWatch, etc.  But I believe the greatest competitive advantage of Apple is its proprietary integration of hardware and software.  This creates a user experience that is limited to their products and business ecosystem (i.e. iTunes, iCloud, etc.).  With that, most hardware 'innovation' that they make will likely turn a profit and further.  When have you remembered Microsoft or any other tech company provide seamless (and often effortless) synchronization across all of their devices and platforms?
