They've been pretty vocal about how they're investing in the company to get it where it's more competitive in digital sales, and that this is a drag on earnings.  In spite of this, they're still trading around 14x earnings with this drag, and you can collect a 2.9% dividend while you wait out the transition.\n\nJNJ is another nice pickup right now, and is another case where they've been off their highs for almost a year already.  Their balance sheet has more cash than debt, they're trading at 17x trailing earnings, and they have a robust drug pipeline to keep earnings growing for the forseeable future.  They're vulnerable to foreign currency exchanges, but these days so does everyone else.  It's not exactly a fire sale, but JNJ doesn't go on fire sale.  It's trading at a more fair price than we've seen it at in awhile, and they're sitting at a 3% dividend yield.\n\nT & VZ.  I think most Americans view cell phone service as a necessity these days, and even during challenging economic conditions are likely to cut other things before cutting that chord.  5.5% & 4.6% dividend yields respectively, and low volatility stocks.
