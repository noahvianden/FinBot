We're in the negative territory on short-term paper and everyone is selling the long-term bonds to the Central Banks via QE.\n\nDown the horizon (possibly March) when rates rise, there will probably be devastation on a worldwide scale. The exit from government debt will actually accelerate as rates rise, because the interest expenditures on the debt are going to be astronomical. The budget of every government will go bust. This is because, as I said before, there has been a massive sell-off on the long end and most outstanding debt expires in 2-5 years now. The Fed keeps talking about the need to \"normalize\" (i.e. raise) rates because they need to save the pensions.\n\nCalPERS had a return of just 2.4% last year. Pension structures are based off an average annual return of 8%, so this is becoming a serious problem. Many (if not most) pensions are required by law to hold a large % of their portfolio in government debt. Illinois just had its credit rating dropped to one step above junk, and they will delay their pension payments for November and December. \n\nSo governments worldwide are broke, and they want you to pay them negative interest for their debt, which is supposedly AAA, but if you look at Detroit, Puerto Rico, and Illinois under a microscope you see that many munis aren't so risk-free after all. The Netflix tax is a perfect example of what we have over the horizon. Instead of addressing the fundamentally unsound structure of the system, they just find someone or something else to tax. As governments go broke, they will go on the tax hunt, and that will cause a shift of assets. The most attractive by far is the stock market, where the tax has a cap of 15% if you hold on to shares for more than a year. \n\nWhere else are you going to get your returns? Stocks are portable. Try leaving France with a suitcase of gold coins. Why is it that we are seeing record art auctions? Art is a portable way to store wealth. Gold, unfortunately, isn't. Neither are bonds or real estate as they just peaked again. \n\nTLDR: Pensions and investors have nowhere else to go but the stock market given the fact that everything else sucks.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "What do you read to learn all this?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "[removed]", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks, I appreciate the response.

As rates rise, capital will be even less inclined to park in debt since all assets will rise as well. Remember that MONEY is on the opposite side of ASSETS.\n\nInterest rates in a developed economy reflect the âoptionâ value on the expected decline in purchasing power of money. If I expect it to decline by 5%, then I expect a profit, and say want 8%. You in turn will pay the 8% only if you think you also can make a profit above 8%, perhaps 10%+.\n\nThere is a notion out there that the equity market will crash once rates take off.
