Primary and Secondary results have met their standard of efficacy, as hemoglobin was increased and maintained in patients. The biggest part of AKBA’s results was that they have met Cardiovascular Safety standards, which was investor’s biggest worry. Vadadustat has met, in an “extremely constant” manner, it’s primary safety endpoint.\n\nEdit: AKBA is working on a phase-2 oral dosing study, which will allow dialysis patients to take three, or daily, oral doses a week.\n\nEdit: TDAPA pays dialysis providers, which encourages providers to use experimental therapeutics. AKBA believes that this will boost the acceptance and sale of Vadadustat.\n\nEdit: AKBA announces they believe that they have all the commercial power needed to boost sales when released, as they already have a commercial platform selling a different drug. \n\nEdit: Focus of the company: Submit NDA to the FDA in 2021\n\nEdit: QUESTION SESSION CONCLUDED\n\nMy take: This is no swing position.

I saw today that one analyst said its undervalued and he put an 80% increase on the stock.  That would put it at around $28-35ish value.  Safer to buy shares at this point.  An article came out saying Apple made them a buyout offer which they declined, and the company is also not commenting.  Obviously Apple needs an WV company in order to produce their vehicle and they already said it's with Hyundai and rumors of cannoo coming in for their tech is rampant. \n\nThe price will either drop at open and climb up throughout the day on all the people buying the news, or it will open high and keep climbing, and if that's the case the calls will be super expensive due to the volitility and hard to make a profit on unless we see 2-3 days straight of large price increase. \n\nSmart play, like I said, would be to buy shares and hold.  You can sell them at some point and wait for the stock to flatten out and dip and stay stagnent for a day or two, at which point then you can buy long calls. \n\ngo check out the cannoo website, from what I remember off the top of my head they don't plan on producing their vehicle commercially for a year or so, so worst case scenario you hold the shares if they dip, until they are at a point you want to sell them. \n\nIf you want to buy some calls tomorrow you should look into buying Salesforce or bigcommerce which are both low volitility.  You can buy some bigcommerce April calls and hope for good earnings release, also with salesforce you could buy some June $250-280 calls and hope their earnings are good.  the saleforce calls are like 40% volitility right now, so you won't lose a bunch of instant value on the calls since that's such a low volitility, and come earnings that amount will probably increase leading up to the announcement.", "score": 8, "replies": []}, {"body": "I actually don’t know.
