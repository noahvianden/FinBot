Also, because it works by a T-cell response, mimicking the natural immunity you get from a cold, it's expected to be more effective against mutations and even the common cold. Plus, it doesn't require refridgeration, the vaccine is good at room temperature for a year (mRNA vaccines need to be kept at -80). So, safer, more effective, easier to deploy. \n\nBut, corrupt assholes like Dr. Fauci and the BP insiders at big pharma are trying to keep them out of the spotlight and delay their trials as much as progress. In September, the Friday afternoon before the Monday that Ino was supposed to start P2/3 trials, the FDA put a partial clinical hold because they had \"additional questions\", and once Ino responded, the FDA took the full 30 days they were allowed to remove the clinical hold and allowed only a phase 2 trial.\n\nIt's my firm belief they have the best vaccine technology, period (not just for covid).

They wrote contracts agreeing to buy/sell a ton of shares at a certain price at a certain date... except they don't actually *have* the cash to be doing this with. What they were hoping to happen was keep the price down to ensure that the contracts would be profitable without ever needing to actually own the shares or have the cash to begin with.\n\nAnd if you don't care about the cost of buying shares... then what's stopping you from just writing as many contracts as you want? Free money, right?\n\nWell, they got caught with their pants down. Short interest on GME skyrocketed to 140%, and people sniffed something fishy reeeeaaal quick. Now, these firms are getting screwed because they'll be contractually obligated to buy the shares at whatever price we can sell them for.\n\nIn my mind, there's a powerful moral in this story for everyone here, especially newbies: **NEVER. SELL. NAKED. OPTIONS.** This should be *Trading Safety 101*.\n\nKids, if you want to sell a call option and collect that juicy premium money, you better own 100 shares of that company for when the piper comes calling. Likewise, if you want to sell a put option, you had better have enough cash to *actually buy* 100 of those shares at whatever price you picked.\n\nMost brokers will enforce this on individuals, **but these firms and market makers are getting a pass, and I think it's time for that to end.** There wouldn't be any need for bailouts if people quit doing stupid shit, and if the executives responsible were actually held accountable (unlike 2008.)\n\nSincerely, some random Theta that just wants this whole thing to be over so I can get back to selling *covered* calls on my shares of BB, AMC, and so on, without waking up to find out they all jumped 1700% in one night.

{"title": "$GME - a glimpse from the other side of the trade", "selftext": "The reason I was even in on the $GME trade is because I believe equity analysts lack imagination. I've used the example of when NFLX shipped DVDs in the mail [before](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4cvmt/why_im_long_gme/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) to illustrate my view that people who have majored in Finance/Accounting are going to value a company by what it's traditionally done, and not by what it *could* do.\n\nBut as I watch the hundreds and hundreds of posts about $GME now I worry that **Reddit Retail** is now falling into the trap of lacking imagination.\n\nSo, think of the Spongebob \"Imagination!\" meme for a second and then follow along with me: if I were at a Short Hedge Fund that was still Short $GME I would flatten my position next week by completely bypassing the Stock Market.\n\nThe Institutional and Fund Holding rates of $GME is over 70%, which means that only around 20% of the float is free to trade when you discount Insiders.

I suppose you can think of it as a private auction house for Billionaires.\n\nInterestingly, because of all the attention **Reddit Retail** currently has, it's actually possible that Funds currently Long $GME will NOT be willing to bail out the Shorts via Dark Pools, because one anonymous whistleblower could cause a massive PR headache for the Long Fund.

{"title": "PSA: Robinhood Users - MODS PLEASE DON'T DELETE", "selftext": "**TLDR: I see a lot of talk about moving and less walk.  I believe that is partly due to misinformation about the ease of switching so please read if this applies to you.**\n\nLet me start by saying the following: People can sell when they want, buy when they want, and I have no agenda here regarding that.  I also don't work for any other platform and I really don't care which one you move to, if you move at all.  I have read dozens of posts from Robinhood users (I am not a user of their platform) that range from mild displeasure to full-on outrage.  I have read far fewer posts, however, about people actually initiating the process of moving to a better online brokerage option.  There are several but first let's cover some basics so that you are fully informed on how easy it is.  If you had started the process of moving on Thursday when you should have you'd probably be ready by Tuesday/Wednesday of this week so don't delay any further!\n\n**I Read Three Main Concerns, Each I will Briefly Address:**\n\n1. Users think they have to sell their holdings first.  THAT IS FALSE.\n2. Users think they can only use one platform.  THAT IS FALSE.\n3. Users think the process is difficult or other brokerages cost money.  THAT IS FALSE.\n\n**You Do NOT Have To Sell Anything:** Online brokerages gain and lose clients all the time and anything a transfer occurs it is VERY simple.  I'm finding this aspect of the posts so confusing because it's just as easy to open a new account online at any of the \"Big Boy\" brokerages as it is with Robinhood.  You simply go online, answer questions, and generally your account is open right away!  Next you'll need to fund the new account which you can do in several ways or a combo of a few.  You can link the new account to a checking/savings account you have with a bank, you can transfer assets (UNSOLD) from an old account your new one, and usually one or two other options.  The term for transferring holdings from one brokerage to another is **\"In Kind Transfer\"**.  Essentially, if you own shares in many stocks or shares in just one stock the old brokerage simply transfers them to the new one.\n\nIt would be good to have the routing and account number handy from any account you wish to bring money from too.  If you don't know this simply call your bank first thing Monday morning and ask.  Or go to a branch.  Or go look at the bottom of a check you have and find them there (Google which number is which so you get it right).\n\n**You Can Have Multiple Accounts With Different Brokerages:**  An easier option may simply be to open a new account over the weekend with a different brokerage, get the funds transfer started ASAP, and as soon as the money is there then you can start buying whatever you want from your new account.  You can own *X number* of shares of a company in Robinhood and *Y number* of shares in that same company with a different brokerage.  This is generally what I find my peers to be doing (I'm considered of boomer age by the WSB population) and there are actually a number of reasons to do this.  I think in light of events from this week that point should be self-evident.\n\n**This Process Could Not Be Easier, And Ironically Robinhood (& Others) Applied Pressure Years Ago And Now Most Accounts Have Free Trading:**  That's right, my boomer Vanguard account used to charge a commission for me to buy/sell stock.  Now it is free!  Similarly the commission on options has come down.  Robinhood tricked you into thinking they were doing something different or better.  They actually weren't and certainly now they aren't.\n\nCAVEAT: Vanguard's app sucks.  Some of the other grown-up brokerages apps are better and I've never used Robinhood (but I've seen a million screen shots) and it seems that Robinhood and similar brokerages did design easier platforms, especially mobile-based platforms.  ***HOWEVER, when you've got thousands, tens of thousands, or hundreds of thousands of dollars at stake I'm dumbfounded why a user wouldn't want something LESS basic.***\n\nThe transfer may cost you $75 at most (from what I'm reading) but I think the move would be worth it.  But as I wrote above, if you don't want to transfer then just open a new account and keep two open.  One that treats you like shit and tells what you're allowed to do with your money and a new one that appreciates your business and allows you to do whatever you want.  Not sure the choice should be hard here.\n\n**FINALLY, A Note About Margin:** All accounts can have Margin (generally) but that doesn't mean you should use it.  I thought all night about writing this because if you fucks come onto one of my platforms and do a ton of stupid shit and get me banned from being able to buy/sell common stocks I'll be pissed.  But in the effort of giving us, the little guy a chance I felt it better to put this here.  ***Borrowing money to buy stocks is stupid and in the long run you will lose money either from depreciation of account value or interest OR BOTH.***  If you're holding GME on margin right now, for example, you might be best opening a new account and not doing a transfer because you don't want your new brokerage to restrict your trading because you seem high risk.  Obviously some of the bigger, better brokerages may start making their new account process harder anyway if they see an influx of what they deem to be risky investors coming over but I'd suggest you be first in line before that happens if you want to be up and trading THIS WEEK.\n\nI have buried this part at the bottom because I wanted the message to be heard before any of my own thoughts were placed in here.  \\*\\*I personally am finding it a bit on the nose that so many people are claiming that they're going to \"\\*\\****hold until Valhalla!\"*** **and yet they aren't willing to freeze their trading ability for a 4-5 business day process for a transfer to happen.**  That is suspect AF to me but that's just me.\n\nIf people want recommendations of brokerages to consider new accounts with I offer some ideas:\n\n* Vanguard\n* TRowe Price\n* Merrill Edge (especially if you bank with Bank of America this is going to be your best bet because money should transfer instantly)\n* Fidelity\n* TDAmeritrade/Charles Schwab (though I may have read they're restricting buying so check that first)\n\nTo my knowledge all of these platforms allow you to sign up for a new account instantly online, or very close to it.  If you do nothing over the weekend and nothing first thing Monday morning to correct this Robinhood situation that it seems many of you are in (and believe me, I feel we're brothers in this and therefore I'm trying to help) then I will remain baffled and I'll be sad to see you guys continue to be squeezed.  I have been able to buy dips this past week that you guys weren't and that sucks.  Good luck gents, you no longer have any reason to be dicked around by Robinhood and I suggest you get on this ASAP because this week could get worse.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*For whatever reason mods keep deleting my shit so I have no idea how long this will be here.  I think it's because a mod accused me of PD-ing on another sub and I called them out but I can't confirm that.*  ***If you are that mod and you read this I'm still holding that position so please consider the disservice of removing this before you do.*** *Disclosure again: I don't work for any of those brokerages mentioned above.*", "id": "l8ortf", "created_utc": 1612022873.0, "score": 79, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 71, "comments": [{"body": "I believe Fidelity owns a ton of GME shares...\n\nSo should be no issues there.", "score": 33, "replies": [{"body": "Just open accounts in all of them just in case fidelity is on the other side of one down the road.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Have TDA and Fidelity, transferring portion of my stuff from RH to Fidelity starting today.
