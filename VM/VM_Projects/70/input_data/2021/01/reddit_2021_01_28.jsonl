{"title": "Gamestop Netflix movie premier date and cast", "selftext": "So, people have been absolutely crushing it. The predictions occured early (no reason to complain you missed out) and plenty of well written analysis were provided for people to make their own decisions on what to do. Also, a boatload of memes, \"can't stop, won't stop, Gamestop\" quotes, and if awards were a stock they would be spiking in value due to this subreddit. \n\nInevitably there will be a movie and more of the truth will come out that this is a random group of retail investors and that hedge funds are the ones who should be investigated by the SEC for decades of privately sharing information and swaying the market with their price targets and interviews on the news. \n\nNot only are us retail investors curtailed on various platforms on when we can trade and what types of trades we execute pre/post market there is already information asymmetry with the information hedge funds with deep pockets can pay for and what we have access to. Yet somehow, sharing information publicly where even hedge funds can view it is seen by these delinquents as \"unfair\". I call bull and also call a Netflix movie on all this!\n\nStars:\n- r/deepfuckingvalue\n- wsb mods\n- @chamath\n- Elon, cause wtf not\n- Cramer\n- Gamestop board (and some old board who sold a bit too early...)\n- other boards of heavily shorted stocks. (AMC, AXDX, BBBY, FIZZ, etc...) \n- who else would the group root for? \n\nEvil people who lost boatloads of $$\n- Melvin Capital\n- Citron\n- companies that bailed out Melvin\n- Random hedge funds that followed suit with their shorts\n\nIf I was buying calls on the movie date I would aim for a late fall 2021 expiry. But, I would pick up some additonal calls at good value for an end of summer time frame. Who's in this to expose what is really happening in the market with the hedge funds? \n\nNetflix, if you want a smash hit - you have one. You just need to dig deep and show what is really happening. \n\nThe tide has changed hands and here we are.

{"title": "You are all being outsmarted bigly. Don't let them fight out of the corner, snap out of it and pin them again.", "selftext": "Don't let the hype get to you, we're barely making a dent in Wall St. Indices are up today, everything is going according to plan for them.\n\nYou think this is WSB vs Melvin? It's not. This is Navalny vs Putin, we're all just along for the ride. It's not like all the rich people in the world were shorting GameStop and then America's working class became the only buyers on the market. Ryan Cohen isn't working class. Plenty of money was long on GME from the start. \n\nYou think you've never seen reddit and the internet so united on something? During the Obama presidency all social media platforms including reddit did a blackout one day to protest for net neutrality. Was that so ineffective you completely forgot about it? 2 Presidents later, are your internet connections reliable or does YouTube still magically work better than all other video sharing sites?\n\nRobinhood's CEO couldn't care less about this lawsuit, in fact he's probably in on it. The description of Robinhood's offenses in that filing document had the grammar of an Indian scammer and it's not normal for the lawsuit to have been filed this quickly. The class action lawsuit is just something the colluders are doing to distract everyone from filing real lawsuits. This way the colluders won't have to pay a dime, they'll just have to steal from Robinhood's investors to pay some token sum, and it's not like they mind stealing. \n\nThere's a big market correction coming and brokers are going to be scrutinized for it. Before today, that scrutiny would have included questions of why basic risk mitigation methods brokers have used in the past were not used here. By staging a big heist and framing it as risk mitigation, they make risk mitigation seem entirely fake and make sure nobody will care about any questions of why brokers left clients to swim or drown. I'm not saying I would necessarily want them to interfere with the trades of clients to save them from losses when the big crash happens, letting people think and act for themselves seems good to me, but it's still very dumb to let the brokers shut down the whole conversation.\n\nIt's not like this means your broker will stop using fake risk prevention as an excuse to steal from you. It just means nobody will ever ask why they don't do *actual* risk prevention, and in the eyes of dumbass regulators they'll get to play an angle of \"poor me, when I do risk prevention they accuse me of stealing, I guess I shouldn't even try to help them.\" \n\nYou think everyone's just gonna switch to a good broker and everything's gonna be ok? There is no good broker. Paying commission creates a house advantage directly. Paying no commission creates a house advantage indirectly by making it financially sustainable to freely manipulate the trades of users without any consequences. There is no legitimate broker who will just let a poor person buy and sell whatever stock or option contract they want whenever they want and collect the majority of their own gains. The stock market is owned by rich people, the brokerages are owned by rich people, they don't want you to win, what makes you think they'll let you? \n\nThe wealthy and the intelligent are in a race to kill each other. The wealthy are not willing to let intelligent people live and intelligent people are not willing to let the wealthy kill them so the wealthy are trying to wipe out everyone who's not on their side fast enough to stop smart people from taking their wealth and smart people are trying to take away their wealth fast enough to stop them from killing everyone. Last year's new culling method was covid, the next year's will be a famine. Many people will be starving to death. Many of those will be in the utter hell of knowing they would have been ok if they hadn't been outsmarted by the rulers and robbed via stock market manipulation and psychological warfare. I can't save all of you but I hope this post saves somebody from losing the psychological war.\n\nIf you can be smart enough to learn from this situation you can probably beat all this market manipulation and avoid being one of the ones to starve. Stay aware of your risks moving forward and design your trades to eliminate those risks. Design your trades to leave the ruling class with no options. Don't let one side use you against the other side in the ruling class' competition for hierarchichal supremacy, play both sides against each other as appropriate and use their game against them to benefit yourselves. Don't sell GME too early and give all your money to one side but don't sell GME too late and give all your money to the other side either. If enough of us are smart we can back all of them further into their corner and make them regret today.
