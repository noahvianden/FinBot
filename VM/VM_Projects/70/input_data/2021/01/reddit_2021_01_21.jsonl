Yes, they seem to have a huge breakthrough just about to happen. Yes, they actually have an announcement or two. Yes, people have gotten excited and rushed in. But in nearly each case, the talk fizzled out and investors were left holding bags (hmm, yet to see what happens long term with NIO, but the rest still holds).\n\nNow I'm wondering if $BB is following in these footsteps. The price jumps seem so OTT in comparison to what they've actually announced. Nearly 100% in a week, 52 week highs, highs not seen for 2.5 years?!\n\nWhat do others think about this? Is this just irrational exuberance by the market, or Pumpers, or Robinhooders looking for the next rocket to the moon? Or, do they really have something amazing buried underneath all the hype, and if so, what is it (with numbers, not just talk)?", "id": "l1ntnm", "created_utc": 1611192610.0, "score": 53, "upvote_ratio": 0.74, "num_comments": 81, "comments": [{"body": "Bb is not a meme stock.

Tether your snack pack of crayons and strap on your bubble helmets, because I think I found us some 1st class seats on the 🚀 to tha 🌖\n\nWith all the attention surrounding the new Space ETF upcoming from everyone’s favorite Cougar: Cathie Wood over at ARK, I’ve tried to research exactly who could potentially end up in this portfolio, and one company is standing out to me far above some of the other seemingly obvious big names that you would expect: Nano Dimension.\n\n**WHAT THEY DO**\n\nNNDM builds 3D printers that fab complex electronic components. Their Dragonfly printer can simultaneously print conductive and dielectric mediums to create things like circuit boards, semi conductors, capacitors, and lots of other tiny computer guts that makes stuff work. [Really cool shit.](https://youtu.be/LbXJ-F9PVKo)\n\n**WHO THEY ARE**\n\nAn Israeli company, ran by Yoav Stern. He’s kinda cool for a boomer, actually. Been involved in everything from Aerospace to Security, and is now the HNIC at Nano Dimension. The company has made some big fucking moves in 2020, and they look to be set up nicely for a pivot in a new direction that will revolutionize the way people approach fabrication and manufacturing.\n\n**WHY WE LIKE ‘EM**\n\nNano Dimension has put themselves in a pretty good spot to tackle the future. They’ve rolled out quite a bit of stock offerings over the past few months, but thanks to that and the enthusiasm generated around their product? They’ve successfully raised over 1 Billion dollars [straight cash, homie](https://realmoney.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/nano-dimension-s-cash-raising-could-lead-to-some-intriguing-scenarios-15542708) while maintaining virtually zero debt. With 💰 like that on tap, you can pave a long, wide road into the future. They’ve also recently appointed this [AI genius by the name of Dr Eli David to the Board of Directors](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/01/20/2161517/0/en/Nano-Dimension-Appoints-Dr-Eli-David-to-the-Board-of-Directors.html) to help them gear up their manufacturing process. This dude has written a lot of words on a lot of papers about AI. He’s Wicked Smaht.\n\nThis kind of advancement will revolutionize every aspect of the tech industry. Think about it: it’s a damn sight cheaper to send a 3D printer into space and have it build all the shit you need up there, instead of having some 3rd world knuckle-dragger who’s just looking forward to his next break actually do his job and make the part, then put it on a rocket/boat/plane/whatever for weeks, just to get it to some other jerk-off who actually install’s it to complete the cycle. Hell, if you know anything at all about manufacturing, you should be salivating at the thought of how goddamn awesome it would be to not have to rely on China or Taiwan or whoever to make something you desperately need for your complicated-ass computer or robotics system to work. Let alone the time advantage and convenience of walking over to Dragonfly, slapping some keys, and POOF: part is in your hand. \n\nThis company is undervalued as fuck if you ask me. Shit, man, the cash they have on hand alone is twice their market cap. There’s been more posts about this company popping up here, but the GME short saga and BB revolution has taken a lot of the light. (Which is great, because fuck Melvin & Hooray privacy!) Yet, I can’t help but see the potential in this company, especially with the gains they’ve made over the last 3 months or so. Words getting out. Don’t miss this one!\n\n**Disclosures**\n\nJust because NNDM has a shitload of cash and a good product doesn’t necessarily mean the new direction the companies going in will be successful (although it seems management has a good goal for the tech, and a sound plan on reaching it). I also can’t really find a ton of background info on neither one of these assholes I’ve named, so for fucks sake: do some digging on your own. \n\nNNDM should be our next big meme stock. Don’t wait.

Palantir was founded by Peter Thiel who is one of the top Entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley, and is really smart guy. The company has a mission to build the leading data analysis platform and really focuses on providing a great user experience. That was also Apple's strategy which helped fuel its adoption - they made their iPhones and other products very user friendly.\n\nPalantir has competitors like Splunk and Datadog which are more popular in the mainstream tech industry but for limited purposes: gathering and analyzing applications monitoring data etc. Palantir products are more like Operating Systems (think Windows) which can be plugged and used for any purpose and not restricted to just application monitoring or a few other use cases. Even though Splunk markets themselves as The Everything Data platform, majority of their customers are other SaaS companies which rely on Splunk to analyze their applications logs.\n\nPalantir is poised to go up, at least 5x upside in next 2-3 years, maybe even sooner, but its success in the long terms really depends upon its marketing to the everyday user. Their primary focus has been on doing partnerships with enterprise and defense industry which is great, but expanding to the everyday average user e.g small businesses which can use their software to automate operations and analyze their sales data, is where the real growth lies. Google wouldn't be this popular if they only focused on offering search operations to Enterprise customers. The more Palantir penetrates the everyday data market, the more it will boom.
