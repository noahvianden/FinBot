Really expensive for what I needed. It requires this special goddam ink that is way overpriced and if you run out, you can't print postage. They bump their prices every year just like this article says which is infuriating because it eats away at profits. This company left such a bad taste in my mouth, I swore I would never use them again. Shopify will bill your postage for sellers right from the web now, Endicia which processes postage payments was acquired by stamps com. I think PB is late to adapting to the web game and will dwindle away. It's going to hit big resistance going back to 2012 at $10. Two failed attempts already at $10 is not inspiring.
