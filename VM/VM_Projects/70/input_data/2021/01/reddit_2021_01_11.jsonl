The company announced in December that it will sell up to $5 billion in stock to raise additional cash for factory expansions. The offering drives a growth cycle that allows Tesla to more efficiently build out production capacity while retaining healthy cash reserves, the bank said.\n\n\"It is important to recognize that the higher the upward spiral of Tesla's stock goes, the cheaper capital becomes to fund growth, which is then rewarded by investors with a higher stock price,\" the analysts said.\n\nFor the time being, the bank expects the bulls' winning streak to rage on. Tesla's ability to aggressively build new factories to meet strong demand will lift deliveries and improve its ability to raise cash through stock offerings. While production woes and cash shortages plagued the company just years ago, Tesla's soaring valuation alleviates those concerns and cements the automaker's position as the world's dominant electric-vehicle producer, Bank of America said.", "id": "kv7v6h", "created_utc": 1610387529.0, "score": 93, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 76, "comments": [{"body": "by any chance would it rise before 1/15", "score": 20, "replies": [{"body": "god speed brother", "score": 19, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Article says it expects it to rise 8% to 900 in the next 12 months.

Having said that, I think Tesla, as an auto company will grow far faster than any of it's incumbent competitors because:\n\n\\- There seems to be some very good EVs rolling out.  The Mach E and ID4 definitely look like good options.  However, these sales will often come at the expense of buying an Explorer or Tiguan.  So if VW sells an ID4 instead of a Tiguan, that doesn't give VW any growth of overall market share.  They will canibalize their ICE sales with their new EVs.  I don't think they will put a serious dent in Tesla's sales tbh.\n\n\\- Despite the competition coming out with good cars, they are not clearly ahead of what Tesla has today.  At BEST it's apples to apples and consumers will choose between the two.  I would argue that Tesla still has the better technology with over the air upgrades and better infotainment.\n\n\\- Autopilot and FSD are superior to what the competition has, and many are not even working on developing this.  Tesla's lead here is big, and growing.   Even the current tech is impressive, but if they solve level 5 autonomy it will be a massive boost to revenue.\n\n\\- Don't underestimate the benefit of the Supercharger network.  Driving long distances in a Tesla is much easier than any other EV.\n\n\\- Tesla is aggressively cutting costs both in overall vehicle construction (single castings for the frame, massively reduced wiring, exoskeleton for CT) but more notably the battery pack.  The new 4680 cells are purpose-build for EV applications and will become part of a structural component of the car.  The new cells, seem superior to anything developed previously.  Further, they are going back to the lithium ore stage (mining) to source and process their own lithium.\n\n\\- They will produce their own batteries at high volume as they see the need for batteries being one of they key bottlenecks for producing more EVs.  They will continue to use batteries from LG, Panasonic, and CATL but add their own (massive) supply.  If everyone else gets into the EV game, where will all of the batteries they need come from?  No one else, from what I know, is getting into the battery business.  None of the incumbent auto makers have any expertise in developing or producing batteries.  They will all be at the mercy of their supply chain and all trying to wring out more water from a dry sponge.\n\n\\- Tesla will compete in many different segments: luxury sedans (Model S Plaid will be amazing), SUV, cross-over, pickup, hypercar, and semi.  That is a lot of disruption across the industry.\n\nAll of that applies to the auto business but I think much of the potential value will be realized on the energy side.  If you look at the biggest companies in the world by revenue, many are in the oil or energy business.
