{"title": "BB is Dog DooDoo and Here is Why", "selftext": " \n\nI am also an engineer at an OEM. IoT  has been getting more popular lately but BB isn't doing anything special  here. Companies like TopCon (Tractors/Combines), Rexroth (Mobile  Equipment), IFM (Industrial), ect. are way ahead of the game here with  this tech and have been doing it a lot longer. BB says they have 63% of  the market on EV's? How many companies actually make EV's? Not many. If I  was an automaker I'd be looking to adjacent industries for an already  existing tech to use.\n\nThis  is what TESLA did by using the RC controller from Rexroth, which is  mainly a mobile hydraulics supplier (i.e. construction equipment). Every TESLA car has one of these controllers under their hood. \n\nTopCon  has 15 years in this IoT space and self driving tractors all use this  technology. They are also thinking about breaking into the automotive  field as well.\n\nIf you're an  engineer looking into IoT, you've probably heard of IFM as well. These  guys are like the Cadillac of IoT/Touchscreen displays. Incredibly smart  engineers work here and all their products are made with a focus on  data security. I've probably sat down in a dozen or so meetings with  various companies about IoT. Most are generic bland dashboards and use  the same hardware. So from an OEM standpoint, how do I choose which one  to use? Well who has the most value-add in this space, in terms of  cooperation/engineering support for integrating their tech into our  equipment? IFM is leagues above these other companies in this instance.  Most of the companies out there treat IoT like it's a side hustle but  it's going to be huge going forward no doubt.\n\nTldr;  BB will probably get squeezed out of this space like they did in the  phone industry because major players are ahead of the game compared to  them. Partnered with AWS? Oh boy! Better watch out!
