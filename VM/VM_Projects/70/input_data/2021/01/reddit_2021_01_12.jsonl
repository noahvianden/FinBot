{"title": "“TSLA bubble is going to pop”", "selftext": "~ Giga Berlin comes online in middle/fall of this year. Model Y will take 24 months to fully ramp and dominate EV sales by taking the single largest share. This is because the car would be superior in every way including manufacturing (single cast pieces for both front & back), paint (Elon has stated it will be world’s most advance paint shop), range (due to better cells in the structural pack design - something Elon said would render everybody else uncompetitive long-term if they don’t copy Tesla’s design philosophy exactly), expanded Supercharging Network and in-car software. \nGiga Berlin will be producing cells (world’s most advance) and long-term be world’s biggest cell production plant (250 GW capacity as stated by Elon).  \nThe next car that would be produced (2022 year end) is a smaller sized vehicle for the biggest segment in Europe. This will keep ramping up until 2025. \n\n~ Giga Shanghai is going to contribute significantly towards 800k+ yearly guidance. Model Y will be the best selling car in its segment as Model 3 was in 2020. Tesla is building a factory in China to produce 10,000 Superchargers annually to for massive expansion. Companies like VW in China are done. They’re on their way out. Now only Tesla and Chinese automakers would compete. FSD sales are low in China but it will change this year when neural networks will be trained for Chinese roads. The only reason Tesla didn’t heavily focus on China was because they were busy with Autopilot re-write.\nModel 2 (tentative name given by fans), their upcoming smaller sized vehicle will be designed this year locally in China. They’re looking for Chief Designer right now. This vehicle will be produced next year. So Tesla will dominate the largest EV segment there as well. \n\n~ Latest FSD Beta already shows that Elon managed to somehow make the “quantum shift” he boasted. Level 5 autonomy will be solved this year. Then it’s a matter of increasing reliability, handling corner cases and convincing regulators. It’s a game set match for Tesla. These sons of b’s did it. Eureka. Tesla will be hosting AI Day this year when Elon will be officially announcing world’s most powerful Supercomputer (exaFLOP level as he stated for video training). This will be offered as AWS like service as Elon stated. \n\n~ Giga Austin will be completed by year end or early next year. There’s a lot of mystery around how this plant will operate so let’s just talk fundamentals. I’m sure since Elon talked about it last time, plans have changed. Cybertruck has 800k+ pre orders. They have enough pre-orders for until 2024. Forget about new orders. “But 100 dollars don’t mean anything” - Look into your heart, you want it. Everybody wants it. It’s the final nail in the coffins of Ford and GM. Semi Truck will definitely disrupt trucking. On paper it already beats everything else. Austin will also be producing Tesla’s 4680 cells. \n\n~ Even if stock goes down, funds will see it as opportunity and bring it right back up. No point arguing over P/E.
