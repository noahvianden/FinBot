{"title": "Why you should invest in Index only", "selftext": "As a disclaimer, this is purely my opinion and i am not a financial advisor. But i strongly believe the majority of us should simply dump all of their cash into VTI or VOO and do nothing else. Here is why:\n\n\n* I strongly believe that 99% of us cannot time the market. If you do anything else that invest for 10+ years, you are competing against bots and teams of pros, and will likely lose money. Might be lucky in the short term, but eventually you will get burned.\n\n\n* Secondly, assuming that you invest for the long term, if you look over a very long time frame, the % of companies that actually would be a good investment over a 30 years period is very small. Do the test and check random companies, created 40 years ago, most of them would have been terrible investments, or even went bankrupt. The long term profits of the stock market is actually created by a small % of companies, and guessing which ones will be successful is often more luck than skills.\n\n\n* Indexing is also way less stressful than anything else. If there is a crash, you can be confident VTI will recover, and you can very safely DCA into it with more cash. VTI is not going bankrupt. We can't say the same about random stock tickers. Even giants fall sometimes. Its also far less time consuming. No research to do, no news to check, just DCA into it whenever you can.\n\n\n\n* The profits you can make using this strategy is deceptively high. With my 50K salary and a frugal life style, and abusing RRSP, i am able to save around 25K a year. If you use an investment calculator, starting with 0$, and putting 2K a month in VTI, assuming 10% profits a year, after 15 years, you will have 830K! You do not need to guess the next amazon to become rich.\n\n\n\n* Please note that i don't think that its terrible to allow a small % of the portfolio to more speculative plays. I myself have some ARKG shares. But you have to keep these as a small % of the portfolio, and avoid too aggressively DCA into it. If it falls, it falls. But keep in mind even thought these plays are beating the SP500 during a bull run, they could be in a lot of pain during the next crash.
