What is up with the covid 19 restrictions that got put in place", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "So, at a very basic level, leverage ratios are a measure of how much of your current wealth comes from debit. A simple and common way of calculating this is your debt to equity ratio, simply all the money you owe divided by how much money you have.\n\nUnder normal times, banks are heavily regulated by the FDIC, among them being a set leverage ratio that banks must meet at the end of every day. This is important as, in the event of a crisis, banks will have enough cash at hand to liquidate. This prevents a bank run like we saw in the 1920s.\n\nDuring covid, banks were given an supplementary leverage ratio (SLR). Basically, restrictions were lowered so banks could take on more debt. This allowed more money to flood into the economy during the worst of the covid pandemic. Along with the SLR came the caveat of banks being restricted from giving out dividends and share buy backs. These two actions really only serve to make the banks and their shareholders more wealthy, so it makes sense that they were restricted. Banks normally try to please their shareholders before trying to fix the world economy.\n\n~~Recently the SLR was done away with.~~ Recently, the lowered SLR was done away with and now things are back to normal. So now banks can give out more dividends, do share buybacks, and now they also need more physical capital to meet the usual leverage ratio requirements.\n\nA bank selling bank bonds is basically the bank taking out a bunch of loans. Its the equivalent of you or me getting a student loan and spending it on whatever the fuck we want. The exception is that banks will be paying off these loans at current interest rates, which are tiny and will go up in the future. So banks are basically getting this money at a discount.\n\nIncreasing dividends helps them as its great for shareholders. If you look at most bank stocks, youll notice a recent uptick because of this. Same with share buybacks.\n\nSo, according to the article, SLR was done away with, interest rates are low, so now banks are gobbling up as much money as possible. The size of these bonds still kinda concerns me, but I guess its probably fine?\n\nEDIT: i just woke up so I made some spelling errors\n\nEDIT: u/merlinsbeers pointed out that I said that SLR was done away with.

Let's break down the conclusion section:\n\n> In March 2020, sales by real money investors led to rising volatility in Treasury markets, and corresponding increases in margins and volatility in repo markets. Large sales from hedge funds trading the basis seem to have followed this event. We show some evidence that these sales may have had a smaller effect on dealer balance sheets than might otherwise have been expected, and in fact that dealers attached particular value to these Treasuries during the peak of March stress.\n\nHmm ok, this is interesting, could have a point here. \n\n> However, these facts must be interpreted in the context of a timely and large intervention of the Federal Reserve into Treasury and repo markets. Without that intervention, our model suggests that the amplifying role of hedge fund sales could have exacerbated illiquidity in the Treasury market.\n\nSo... their model is guessing what would have been the case if the Fed didn't do exactly what they said they were gonna do, which is to keep highly accommodative policies rolling until the economy is back on its feet. Got it. Things could have been different if they were different.\n\n> In the context of ongoing discussions of Treasury market reform, policy makers should therefore consider both the potential impact of the basis trade on Treasury market liquidity, and the broader context that allowed these trades to be profitable in the first place.\n\nOk, so because \"things could've been different\", lawmakers should maybe pay attention to hedge fund treasury basis trading because it could've caused issues. That's fair.\n\n> While this broader research project is only at its beginning, our paper points to important links among repo markets, Treasury markets, and futures markets spanned by hedge funds.\n\nAaaaand there's the kicker. \"While we feel we have some good points, this research is preliminary and we can't say for sure yet that we're right, so we're gonna keep looking into this\".

{"title": "Tech Industry Stock Compensation or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Insider Selling (PLTR)", "selftext": "**EDIT: TL;DR - everyone I see talking about stock compensation in tech (especially companies just coming public) or insider selling around earnings/tax season seems to have an incredible lack of context for how compensation works in Silicon Valley tech. I'm here to give you an insider perspective.**\n\nI posted this in the PLTR sub in response to a lot of threads I saw about insider selling and complaints about stock compensation models in tech companies. Figured I'd also post it here for anyone interested in my take (as a tech worker) on these things.\n\nOkay the title is somewhat misleading because I don't necessarily **love** insider selling, but I've seen a lot of posts here and elsewhere especially on insider selling and I've found there's a misconception of stock-based compensation and selling by insiders. To preface, I am a software engineer for a large cap tech company and this is my take on stock-based compensation in the tech world and some basic things that I think all people should be aware of when it comes to this compensation and the insider selling that accompanies it.\n\nTo start I'll give a little background on the way stock compensation works for people on the ground. The grunts like me who do the normal day-to-day boring coding that enables the apps and products you use. I'll be using mostly the FAANG companies as examples of established public companies and the kind of compensation you see there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**First things first: how does stock compensation work for most of these people?**\n\nAt most of these companies stock compensation is typically most heavy in the technical organizations of the company. That is to say, engineers are being compensated primarily in equity in the company in raw dollar terms, in some cases well over 50% of their yearly income. ***This difference is usually most prevalent in the first four years of employment.***\n\nWhy is that last sentence true? Because your initial grant of equity is typically one of the largest in order to \"get you in the door.\" The cliff, as tech workers call it, at four years is the time at which an engineer will typically experience a net decrease in their overall income due to the fact that one of the largest grants they received expires at this time and their refresher grants are not as sizeable in dollar terms (excepting the most outstanding performers and the most rapid promotions, but these are very rare).\n\nAs a matter of fact, it's a well-known and oft-used strategy to bail from a company after your four year cliff and move to another or SIMPLY REAPPLY TO THE SAME COMPANY FOR ANOTHER INITIAL GRANT. Yes, this happens. I know people personally who have done it. You could call it mercenary behavior.\n\nPersonally, my total compensation every year is comprised of approximately 51% equity, 6.5% bonus, and the remaining 42.5% in salary (accounting for the current share price). And here's the important note about that: ***I am not by any means a stellar performer at the company***. I am at a senior level and meeting expectations well for my job and role but I am not in the upper bands of the most highly compensated individuals as a result of either stellar or lucky performance. I am well past my 4 year cliff though it doesn't matter, because I didn't begin my career as an engineer, which actually cost me a lot of money transferring to engineering. Remember those initial grants engineers get? Transfers don't get those. Point being: I am a decent engineer doing good work and my compensation is still driven mostly by equity. If I were getting much higher ratings, the percentage of my compensation driven by equity would be substantially larger.\n\nEverything you've just read is pretty industry standard for these large caps as mentioned.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Why is this such standard behavior in many companies?**\n\nIsn't the answer obvious? If most of your highly lauded compensation is in stock you are driven to help your company succeed. And depending on your equity grant type maybe even more so.\n\nRemember above how I said that the yearly equity I receive is currently 51% of my total compensation. That's because the share price is where it is. If tomorrow the share price drops by 50%... well that would be bad. You know what would make it worse? The fact that the other load of stock I have in the company isn't vested and just dropped SIGNIFICANTLY in value and depending on what triggered the drop could be heading towards zero.\n\nThat's because the company doesn't hire you and just hand you a fat stack of stock. You vest a portion of it over time, regularly. Industry standard for many of these companies is now that you vest a grant over 4 years at 1/16th each quarter. So for me, right around earnings season I get 1/16th of each grant I've received for the previous 4 years. The point of this is clearly to keep me invested and to keep me driving for my own success by advocating for and working on the best things for the business.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What kind of stock grants are there?**\n\nThere are lots. But I'll quickly go over the one that people like Alex Karp deal with (joining a company well before going public) and the one I'm most familiar with: RSUs.\n\nWith RSUs, it's a pretty simple thing: the company will give you stock every quarter!\n\nOkay so it's not quite this simple but close, and most importantly this is a taxable event - I'll talk about this next. The company hands you a cash bonus (basically) to buy the stock at the current market price and then you exercise that to buy the stock. Awesome! Except... you just got more income... and you have now locked all that money up in shares of your company. Uncle Sam would like a word with you about this.\n\nWith people like Alex Karp the situation is even more interesting: they are given options to the stock in the company. What does that mean? Exactly what you think it does. They are issued long call options with expirations and strikes against the stock. Alex Karp is in this situation now - he has over 60m options expiring that give him the ability to buy Palantir shares at the strike. However, the current price of the shares is well above his strike and the company is giving him compensation in the form of allowing him to buy the shares at their market rate for his strike. Uncle Sam would now like a word with Mr. Karp.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**So how do these taxes work?**\n\nMy company uses a sell to cover model. What does this mean? When I am issued shares my company will simply sell some of those shares after they are purchased in order to send the proceeds to the IRS. What this value represents is the expected value of the tax I would pay on the bonus I was granted to purchase the shares at the current market rate. Basically, I would sell 35% of my shares instantly to cover the expected 35% tax I would owe on the bonus I was granted to purchase the shares. This is pretty straightforward and for someone like me doesn't even really register as insider selling because it's not large enough in quantity and I'm not C suite or any of that. But this is a form of insider selling that is automatic to cover taxes. Read this if you want: [https://thefinancebuff.com/rsu-sell-to-cover-deconstructed.html](https://thefinancebuff.com/rsu-sell-to-cover-deconstructed.html)\n\nWith options it's a bit different because the income to purchase the stock (the bonus) would be the difference between the strike price of the calls given to the employee and the current price of the stock. So Alex Karp's over 60m shares are currently valued at well over a billion dollars. But that means the relative income that the company provided to cover his stock purchase is almost the entire value of the stock (his strikes are really low). Now he has a FUCK ALL MASSIVE TAX BILL on the income he was granted to purchase the stocks.\n\nSo when he exercises these options and then you read about him selling a few million shares, remember this - he is obligated to pay a 37% tax on the income granted to him to purchase those shares that he can either pay with his own money, selling a portion of his grant, or offsetting in some other way.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**These grants given to employees are not just brand new shares**\n\nI've seen a bit of confusion about stock compensation specifically here so I'm going keep it short on this point - this sort of compensation is not just NEW SHARES FOR EVERY NEW GRANT!@!@!!!@@ That's not how it works. Dilution and new share issuance is a thing - but it's not the norm. If you're asking why they keep giving stock to people to work for them and that's why you think the price is dipping on things re-read this portion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Insider selling is predictable**\n\nWhy is this? Most of these people are using 10b5 plans to schedule their stock sales. Insiders are locked out of trading their own stock or even related derivatives the vast majority of the time. That includes grunts like me. Most stock sales that I conduct are for reinvestment purposes and taxes (these are automatic). But the common trait is they all happen after earnings because that's when our lockup period expires and we are granted our new shares. That's why you see people like Zuckerberg, Thiel, Pichai, Bezos, etc. selling at the same time all the time or as a result of a scheduled release. Think of a 10b5 as dollar cost averaging but for the sell side.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Parting thought**\n\nOne of the main reasons I don't freak out when I see insider selling like we've seen here (unless it's dickhead Chamath and his SPACs which I won't touch because fuck that toolbox) is that I see this sort of sell-off all the time and because I understand a bit of the problem space Palantir is in. I actually used to work on the problem that got them to start this company while they were at PayPal: payments fraud. I also know that the industry really, really doesn't know how to handle problems like this as effectively as they think and that there are untapped places where software like this would be invaluable. Even in my own work, I can think of almost a half dozen places where this would be directly relevant to MY role in a large cap. I can only imagine the value if it were company wide.\n\n***Also, you guys know how I look at companies that try to recruit or poach me if they're not public companies?*** When I get messages from these series A and series B folks or stealth startups I almost always go in to look at what their growth potential is. I look at it as though I'm trying to do a value investment. What is their TAM? What will it be next year? What is their current valuation? How has it changed in their funding rounds? What sort of people work there and would I expect to build an amazing company with a ton of deep value with people like that? How do their finances and board structure look to me? Is this going to be attractive to other investors? Is the product they are offering going to be the best? Can I make it that?\n\nWhat do all those questions boil down to: ***WHERE THE FUCK IS THEIR STOCK GOING?!***\n\nBecause here's the thing, most grunts like me who leave our cushy large cap jobs for places like this are doing so knowing full well that we are taking a pay cut. What are we looking for? To create the deep value that is going to drive that stock value way up and offer the best product so that the paper money we are promised to get in the door turns into some real money. What drives us to make it better? Knowing that we have more paper money left on the table that we also want to be worth something. That and most of us leave jobs for paper money for problems we love.

And depending on your equity grant type maybe even more so.\n\nWorking hard towards the business goals and being invested in your companies success is what you receive a salary for. The equity chunk isn't to make you feel more invested in what you're working on. It's there to dissuade you from departing the company on your own terms.  If you know you are forfeiting 200k  in options over the next 4 years by leaving for a new role elsewhere, you're going to be much less likely to look to go elsewhere.

I'm half in, half out on your interpretation. Primarily because I've seen plenty of people negotiate with their outstanding equity for very large grants elsewhere to get in the door. You don't ever get paid out 100% (at least from anything I've ever seen) but it is a decent bargaining chip. And for me, I think it discourages me from chasing paper money except with extreme caution. I'd have no trouble looking at FAANG level companies though because I know what I'm trading for what, and again that whole 4 year cliff thing means that the next company's initial grant might actually eclipse a large part of your outstanding grant as is meaning you'd catch up quick. However, I would say that for people who have options, it's definitely in their interest to ensure that their company is worth more than the notional value of their options since those people must pay out of pocket for their company stock. If they have expirations I think the motivation is a bit heavier too. However, that being said, most options I've ever seen have been in low dollars or fractions thereof so if you're company isn't headed to zero you're probably usually safe.  \n\n\nThanks for your take on this.

Dilution and share issuance often occurs early in the funding process as new investors and people come aboard a fledgling company. After a company goes public share issuances are less likely to occur, although they can for a ton of reasons. But generally speaking, people getting RSUs and exercising options are doing so on the open market. Hence the pressure for people in private companies to eventually take a company public or to seek to generate enough value to be bought out or whatever their aim is.

These shares then effectively cover the taxes that will be paid over the next 4 years, regardless of how high the share price rises.\n\nThe risk is that the share price drops significantly below the grant price, but I’ve still effectively capped my losses in that case and I still have around the same number of shares that were granted.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Thanks retard", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "This is awesome!
