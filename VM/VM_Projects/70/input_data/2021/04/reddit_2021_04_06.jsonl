{"title": "NVAX - I liked it at $300 I LOVE it at $180", "selftext": "Please read these two previous posts before you shit on my positions\n\n[1st Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lq3ksw/nvax_dont_miss_this_perfect_vaccine_play_headed/)\n\n[2nd Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/luuige/nvax_part_ii_last_call_before_a_shit_ton_of/)\n\nFirst of all I want to say fucking GUH to my fellow NVAX brethren that have been riding this tendie rollercoaster with me. This is not for the faint of heart but I'm still positive on the outlook of this stock. Here are the negative events that have sent the stock down and my rebuttals to them:\n\n**1) US approval of JnJ vaccine and additional orders of MRNA and PFE** \\- The US at this point is pretty loaded with vaccine doses, we have enough as it is without NVAX to vaccinate all the US. This leads to the common misconception that NVAX is too late to the party and has missed out. However, the US is still going to purchase 110 million doses from NVAX no matter what once it is approved. The deal is already made. The US gov funded NVAX to get these doses they will not just refuse to buy them. Despite this I still insist the US market share DOES NOT MATTER. Here are a list of other deals NVAX has lined up\n\n* [SHIT TONS](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-announces-covid-19-vaccine-manufacturing-agreement-serum) of manufacturing deals leading to production of 2+ BILLION doses every year across the world\n* [1.1 BILLION dose deal](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-announces-memorandum-understanding-gavi-cumulative) with COVAX the majority of which will be vaccines from NVAX\n* [40 Million Doses](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-announces-expanded-collaboration-and-license-agreement) to South Korea\n* [6 Million Doses](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-and-government-switzerland-announce-agreement-principle) to the Swiss\n* [76 Million Doses + Manufacturing Deal](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-announces-memorandum-understanding-produce-covid-19) to our Poutine eating brethren\n* [51 Million Doses](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-finalizes-agreement-commonwealth-australia-51-million) to Australians\n* [10.7 Million Doses](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-announces-agreement-government-new-zealand-107-million) to the Kiwis\n* [60 Million Doses](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-and-uk-government-announce-collaboration-and-purchase) to the British\n\n**2) EU deal talks with NVAX fall apart citing manufacturing concerns -** OK this one sounds bad I admit. Could it be? NVAX can't actually secure enough of its raw materials to make vaccines for the EU? If they can't even do that how are we supposed to expect them to be able to make vaccines for the rest of the world? The truth is that NVAX was the one that refused to sign the deal with the EU. As demonstrated in [this article](https://www.thepavlovictoday.com/andrew-bridgen-mp-the-eu-and-ursula-von-der-leyen-set-out-to-teach-astrazeneca-a-lesson-but-only-shown-that-they-need-to-learn-one-themselves/) the EU has been an incredibly litigious vaccine customer and has made AZ's life hell. Hence why the EU has been [doing poorly](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/06/eu-blames-astrazeneca-failure-for-sluggish-covid-vaccine-rollout) as far as vaccine rollout goes. Basically, NVAX has more than enough customers that are less troublesome than the EU willing to buy their product and NVAX only has so many doses readily available, why sell to the EU when you can sell to others?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3) Insider selling** \\- If you sell your positions when you see a headline about an insider selling stock you should really reconsider this investing hobby thing and go into buying beanie babies or whatever the fuck you feel more comfortable with because you'll never make money or be able to hug your kids with such fragile paper hands. Execs sell their stock all the time, they schedule selling months ahead of time or just want the money. In fact, NVAX execs were selling their stock at $125 just days before Phase 3 data came out that sent NVAX to $300+. It simply has not been indicative of catastrophic news. \n\n**4) General market pullback** \\- As many of you are aware the market has been extremely rocky in March and NVAX is not immune to this. In fact, being such a high beta stock it is more vulnerable. Biotech has been absolutely slammed by the market in March which makes this a PERFECT buying opportunity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow onto the good stuff - two catalysts I expect this month:\n\n**1) UK Approval -** NVAX has completed its UK Phase 3 trial and the results look GREAT. At 96% efficacy it's the best performing vaccine reported to date. It already had submitted data to the UK as part of a rolling review and should get the approval by the [end of April](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/novavax-covid-19-vaccine-could-be-approved-by-uk-in-april-evening-standard-says-2021-03-30). I cannot stress this enough, I do **not** think approval has been priced in. This would be the very first approval that NVAX has ever received and will finally validate it as a profitable company with a future. Canada, Australia, and NZ would very shortly follow in approvals if this passes in the UK.\n\n**2) US Phase 3 Results -** This will likely take investors by surprise! NVAX enrolled their phase 3 trial in record time which allowed them to get started much earlier than anticipated. Additionally, with 30,000 participants this trial is much larger than the UK trial and they will likely reach their endpoint targets in much less time than what the UK trial took. In fact, this US phase 3 trial [started crossover studies](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/novavax-to-expand-covid-19-vaccine-trials-to-children-teens-2021-04-05) which potentially indicates the interim endpoints have already been reached AND they are now expanding the trial to include children and teens. We were hoping for a long time that the FDA would use the UK phase 3 data but now we might not even have to wait for that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOther positive news/useful info:\n\n**1) This stock has gone through tremendous de-risking.** At $180 a share NVAX is almost down to the price it was before Phase 3 data came out. It can't fall much more, and at a market cap of 12.9 Bn it is grossly undervalued.\n\n**2) Other covid developements -** a) NVAX announced in their earnings call that SA variant trials would begin by the start of the summer and that these would be solely safety-based. If the original vaccine is approved for efficacy these would not have to demonstrate such rigorous efficacy data. b) NanoFlu+Covid or NanoFlu+Covid+RSV vaccine trials are supposed to start by the end of the year.\n\nPositions:\n\n$200c 5/21\n\n$200c 7/16\n\nPrice target = $400", "id": "mlielu", "created_utc": 1617733992.0, "score": 120, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 78, "comments": [{"body": "Also the insider selling stuff is crap.
