Sorry, some guy posting that option pricing is incorrect from a quanative perspective is going to raise my hackles a bit. Especially with such a limited analysis. Further, the whole BRK.B option chain has this same pricing pattern, so you are in effect saying every option on BRK.B is priced wrong, not just the one you mentioned. Sounds a little incredulous. Not saying you are necessarily wrong, but I think it would take a bit more work here before you can say this with confidence.", "score": 16, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "My point was trading on the assumption that IV will increase is simply ridiculous.
