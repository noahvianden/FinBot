They will all gain access to NFL's data feed and be able to integrate their sports betting content into NFL's media platforms (website, app, etc.).

The NFL does NOT have a direct partnership with a sportsbook at this point, just something to note.\n\nTo answer your question, I do think that this is a big deal. Even if other options end up coming onboard in later years, there is something to be said for first mover advantage.

HGEN diluted at $18.50\n\nSold RUBY 35, 30, 25 C for about $1800 gain Sold HGEN 22.50, 20 C for about $350 gain.\n\nRUBY was scary af as someone decided to pump after the dilution(probably the financier JP Morgan) and so I just sold more calls and went higher on the strikes hence the fat profit.\n\nHGEN was ez, they never came for me, but also since they didn't I didn't add anymore.\n\nThis was a really nice revenue stream during the recent downturn in the retail market, especially biotech. Had lots of green here while long stuff was mostly red.\n\nOddly enough I am now selling Puts on HGEN @ 12.50 as I believe it has been murdered enough and it is now post dilution and well under that price.  I may also start the same process on RUBY as it has also received a lot of pain since dilution.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Do you think biotech has a bounce in it at some point, or was it just extremely overhyped and overvalued, and it‚Äôs gonna be down/sideways for awhile?", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "I don't think I've ever seen so much retail buying of biotech than 2020 lol.  So much that there wasn't one, not on OTC, that was under $1 end of year.  So yeah there was a ton of hype obviously.  I try to buy biotech that has a lot of cash relative to their market cap.   I just want to avoid the dilution events and that makes the probability of dilution lower.  Biotechs burn so much cash and they make zilch  They make money by hyping their studies and getting retail to pay for the offerings they need.   My favorite biotech atm because of its cash position being LESS than its market cap(how many do you know that have that?)  is $ABIO.   The problem with ABIO is they don't pump lol so it's a really quiet one.  But I do well selling Puts and Calls due to illiquidity.  My philosophy in general is that it has a strong margin of safety.  It shouldn't go down much at least.  They shouldn't be diluting any time soon etc..  Meanwhile we wait for their treatment results.  In ABIO's case it is a P2 covid treatment due this summer.\n\nThat's my biotech strategy in a nutshell. I really don't care what the treatment, cure, study is.  I'm sure it's awesome.  It's more about what their balance sheet looks like, when they might dilute, how much retail support do they have etc....   \n\nOn the short side of that.  If they had a huge run up and they burn cash heavily you can expect dilution.  At that point I'm more likely to take a net short position.  Usually selling naked calls, sometimes going from covers to naked etc...\n\nSo that was a tangent but illustrative.  To your question directly?  Biotech definitely got hammered last couple months for good reason.  All of retail got hammered so yeah biotech is the riskiest subgroup of that subgroup.  So of course it gets sold off worse.  Was it overhyped?  Absolutely.  That's its job.  Literally.  Was it overvalued?  Of course.  Is that bad?  Nope, that's biotech.  That's how they raise funds.  I don't know the future of the prices.  All I can say is that I think it's been beaten up pretty good and I just try to buy those with low cash to MC value and strong retail support.

It's just easier to make money selling calls after the dilution.  The concept is there will be a wall around the offering price so sell calls above that price.  Any pumps that go over you can continue to sell calls at higher strikes because you assume the pump will be smashed by the financier who is trying to sell their giant bags.  The financier also likes to sell covered calls on those bags so they have an interest in seeing that the price doesn't remain up there in the short term.  So no, not prediction.  Do it after dilution. Big premiums as retail buyers are pissed and think the price should be higher. No surprises tht way.\n\nLook at RUBY and HGEN after the offerings.  You'll see what I mean.
