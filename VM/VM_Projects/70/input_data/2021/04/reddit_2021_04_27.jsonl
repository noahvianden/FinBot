{"title": "What is going on with stock valuation right now?", "selftext": "Tl;dr I want to buy stocks but everything has a P/E ratio double that of what is historically normal, what is going on and why are value ETFs long on so many overvalued positions?\n\nHey all, newbie question here:\n\nI’m new to investing and learning the basics of stock valuation. The way I understand it, you start by looking at a company’s price to earnings ratio, or P/E. From moneychimp.com:\n\n> Although discounted cash flows is the correct way to value a company, people naturally like to use simpler rules of thumb. The P/E ratio is the most popular because it's easy to understand. **If you buy stock at a P/E ratio of 15, say, then it will take 15 years for the company's earnings to add up to your original purchase price - 15 years to \"pay you back\".** That's assuming that the company is already in its \"mature\" stage, where earnings are constant.\n\nIt goes on to say that you may want to buy at a high PE ratio if you expect earnings to keep increasing. \n\nMy understanding is also that the average P/E ratio historically has been somewhere in the ballpark of 13-15. Anything below that, all other fundamentals being equal, is considered a healthy buy.\n\nNow I’m looking into large cap ETFs (I don’t have any positions yet) and checking the valuation of their top holdings and.... I’m seeing P/E ratios *way above* the historical average. Just some examples from this morning:\n\nAAPL: 36.42\n\nGOOG: 37.20\n\nMSFT: 38.96\n\nWMT: 29.06\n\nJNJ: 28.99\n\nAMZN: 81.51 ?!!\n\nTSLA: 1,158.65 ??!!?!\n\nI get that the highest values here are tech, which may have a strong expectation to keep growing, but Tesla with a P/E ratio in the thousands? Is this normal? Is this the result of massive money printing going straight to Wall Street and inflated stock prices relative to consumer goods (and thus relative to earnings)? What is going on?

Factor in inflation and you might as well be lighting your money on fire - this forces more people into the stock market.\n2. These companies are valued with high P/E ratios because of growth or growth potential.\n3. P/E ratio isn't a great metric to value companies that are investing in capital and R&D.  You will need to look at other metrics if you want to properly value these companies.\n\n\nOn a completely unrelated note I think a company like Amazon is currently grossly undervalued and will likely go up another 20-30% this year, while Tesla is very much overvalued.

{"title": "Why Tencent Music Entertainment (NYSE:TME) is in Store for a Strong Recovery", "selftext": "# TME\n\nTencent Music Entertainment is a company that develops music streaming services for the Chinese market. After dropping over 30% in March and slowly bleeding off since, I believe it's in the perfect spot to make back a large amount of that loss.\n\n# So why did TME drop 34% in march?\n\nOn March 24th [the SEC announced](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-53) that they would be taking steps to enforce stricter financial oversight of foreign-owned companies. This meant that violators could be delisted from US exchanges. Being a Chinese company, fears of delisting caused the stock to plummet.\n\n# What has happened since?\n\nThe following Sunday, Tencent Music [announced a 1 Billion dollar buyback](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tencent-music-announces-record-1b-053445707.html) amid the selloff. The stock continued to decline into the first few weeks of April.\n\nHowever on April 21th things began to turn around.\n\n# So why is it a good buy now?\n\n**Technical Analysis:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2grvgjg79mv61.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7feec691c2d2c3108edbc94f4c49b50188b4fd7\n\nTME closed at 19.44 today off the back of 5 straight green days. Today it finally crossed the 200 MA which should provide strong support when moving higher.\n\nLooking up at the RSI we see a sharp bounce off 30 coinciding with the rise in share price. This still has plenty of room to climb as its only at 44 right now. This is bullish for sure, showing a strong upward trend and the stock rejecting being 'oversold'.\n\nLooking down now at the MACD crossing over the signal line again coinciding with the rise in share price. And just like with the RSI the MACD is low right now providing lots of room to grow. This again is bullish as the crossing of the signal line can be the start of a bigger move. We can further see this with the MACD histogram beginning to rise.\n\n**Fundamental Analysis:**\n\nThe key to this stocks strong fundamentals is that the reason it dropped doesn't have anything to do with why the stock dropped in March. It dropped over fears of a potential delisting, but this seemed to be an overreaction. Now that fears have died down, the strong fundamentals of this stock can drive its price back upward.\n\nTencent Music is a joint venture between Spotify and Tencent, both large and successful companies in their own right.  They create a strong partnership where Spotify provides the music expertise, and Tencent helps them navigate the Chinese market.\n\nTencent Music has consistently met earnings and turned a profit year after year. Q1 earnings are on May 17th which could provide further support if strong.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nTME is super undervalued following a headline that doesn't change the company's fundaments at all. All signs point to a strong move upward in the following weeks.\n\n**Not financial advice, do you own DD.**\n\n**Position: None currently, planning to buy tomorrow morning.**", "id": "mzdgxk", "created_utc": 1619487266.0, "score": 24, "upvote_ratio": 0.63, "num_comments": 83, "comments": [{"body": "Pretty sure this was one of the archego liquidated stock, that's why it crashed along with VIAC, DISC.

We did see drops in prices for all Chinese company stocks which was related to the SEC adoption, just not quite as bad as Tencent, because this news was already largely priced in.
