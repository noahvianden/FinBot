{"title": "MNMD IPO on NASDAQ tomorrow: Shrooms are the new Cannabis.", "selftext": "**MNMD will IPO on the NASDAQ tomorrow:**\n\nI  like this stock since it looks like investing in Cannabis in 2011.  Mushrooms are non-addictive. Several states are thinking about allowing it to  be used in medical capacity. Oregon is the first state that has  legislation in the works. I feel so bad for missing out on Cannabis  gains but unlike Cannabis stocks that are all Canadian this will start  with states legalizing mushroom for depression. The evidence for use of  Mushrooms for clinical purposes is undeniable. Harm is low. Profits are  great. Please see the following for further reading:\n\n**A Study to Assess 18-Methoxycoronaridine**\n\n[https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04292197?lead=Mind+Medicine%2C+Inc.&lead\\_ex=Y&draw=2&rank=1](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04292197?lead=Mind+Medicine%2C+Inc.&lead_ex=Y&draw=2&rank=1)\n\nYou can proof this by looking at the revision history of the Trial... Look at Version 5 of the document.\n\n[https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/history/NCT04292197?V\\_5=View#StudyPageTop](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/history/NCT04292197?V_5=View#StudyPageTop)\n\nBoth of these folks are tied to Johnson & Johnson via Janssen... I don't think that is a coincidence.\n\nThey are working with Linear Clinical Research Ltd in Australia / Perth. According to the website:\n\nAustralian (TGA) clinical trial start-ups are typically **4-6 months faster than US (FDA) trials.** Better still, they‚Äôre **much cheaper** ‚Äì often a third of the cost and exceptional quality.\n\n* **No IND required**\n* **Fast-tracked approvals**\n* **Generous R&D refunds**\n* **Excellent health system Access to patient databases**\n* **Data accepted by FDA, EMA, CFDA & PDMA**\n\nLooks    like to me they will fast track in Australia - then partner with    J&J if successful. What you read on this post is my understanding of    this company.
