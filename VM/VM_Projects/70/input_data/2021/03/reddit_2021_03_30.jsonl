{"title": "TSLA vs Volkswagen", "selftext": "A lot of shit is happening around us these days. Stocks are in the bloody stage these days. but some companies are trying to move up nonetheless. \n\nlooking at the TSLA stock performance during the last 3 months I feel like people are disappointed in TSLA. Im kinda disappointed at least, TSLA was strong during the tough times but not anymore. Elon is making random decisions that I am not sure how will ends up. I feel like his focus is shifting. \n\nWVAGY is taking off, Im not sure if it is a good replacement for TSLA or not. But it feels like it is  serious . Im looking long terms like 1-2 years investment. Is this german company going to take over the TSLA? I know some people say TSLA vs Volkswagen is like Apple vs Samsung. \nwell, samsung isn't that bad overall IMO...\nsome brokers have not added Volkswagen to their stocks yet (e.g. I cannot trade in on webull, but I can on Robinhood).
