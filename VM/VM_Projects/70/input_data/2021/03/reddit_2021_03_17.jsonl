I just don't know how you get around that.\n\nPC Gaming hardware is very very hard to make money on, they sell basically at OEM margins like 5% it's a really rough market. That's why that Gateway and Dell explosion from the old days died off so much and you have big retailers move away from it. You could still sell peripherals, but they already do that.\n\nI've heard people bring up the streaming thing. Boy that's tough, you've had huge players completely fail and they threw billions at it.\n\nI just feel like overall I haven't heard anything actually realistic for this transition to an ecommerce strategy, I don't understand what they'd sell.They've made this weird effort to same-day delivery using courier apps like Postmates, but the cost and logistics have made it a bit of a bust. They've have a lot of issues with it too, lot of cancellations, taking like hours and hours to deliver.\n\nIt's just very difficult to value a company losing hundreds of millions a year and then base it on what they might do later on that might work when they haven't even announced what the plan actually is.\n\nSo you've kind of left looking at a $6.5 billion revenue, a 5% negative net income and I don't know how you value that at very much.\n\nHonestly best answer is probably about where it was, like a $15-20 share with some potential upside if they do roll out some sort of coherent execution of a plan.But the short squeeze really does still have some legs here, I think no matter what the March earnings say people will claim it's good, so I can't see this ending before like May.  \n\n\nEDIT: The closest competitor to the model is probably Best buy, but you'd have to remove a lot of the well-marked up services.
