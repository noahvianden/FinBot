The quality issues are only exacerbated by the media since Tesla’s are new manufacturers and people are quick to complain/critique. Other manufacturers have issues as well and it comes down to how they respond to those issues. Our model 3 had a few issues like rattles and paint quality but Tesla was quick to fix all our issues. \n\nAdditionally their battery technology is way ahead of other manufacturers. I’m not sure how you think a 200 mile range is even usable under normal driving conditions (~180m or less). With their new tabless batteries coming out this will only increase their advantage in respect of the EV space.

People think this is going to add substantial long term revenue streams.  That's exceedingly unlikely, because eventually everyone will offer that.  And then the incremental cost to the consumer goes down very quickly and adds little long term value.  There will be a time limited window during which Tesla will be able to derive significant revenue from that.\n\nThat's just one example.\n\nTesla's margin on vehicles hovers around 1%.

Tesla can't open enough factories quickly enough to meet that growth target, even *if* there were no competition and demand was there.

People constantly tell me \"Tesla is a tech company\".  Except tech companies generally can sell a lot of tech without having something as expensive and hard to produce as a car attached to it.  FSD doesn't give you anything without a car attached to it.  Nor does the battery tech.

You’ll never see a crash coming. Usually it’s tied to catalysmic, underlying events. The shoe-shine parable gets discussed every year. Just Google it. You can see an article published about it and a bubble every year.

{"title": "Ryan Cohen and Michael Burry are both invested in another stock that will benefit from a high rate environment", "selftext": "This post has a 99% chance of getting deleted so I'm not gonna waste my time posting a huge DD here. If it survives I'll edit it with all the DD you can stand, but otherwise just click on my profile an look for my WFC (Wells Fargo) DD. Here's the TL;DR  \n\n\n1.) WFC is a bank that was in the doghouse. Fed says it can come out and play now.  \n2.) WFC is a bank and banks do well in high interest rate environments. Rates are skyrocketing right now.\n\n3.) WFC is one of the only big banks that hasn't reached it's pre-pandemic highs, meaning it still has room to run.\n\n4.) When Ryan Cohen sold his stake in Chewy he invested it into just two stocks, AAPL and WFC. You could buy AAPL, but that's a tech stock that isn't going to do as well in a high interest rate & high inflation environment as a bank.\n\n5.) Michael Burry initiated a large position (3.3% of his fund) in WFC last quarter. You all know what happened last time Burry and Cohen agreed on stock.\n\n6.) WFC has really freakin' cheap options. June 45c (that's about 22% out of the money) were going for 80 cents today. IF WFC gets to $50 by June (about 34% gain) those calls would be worth $5 intrinsically. That's over 500% gains on the calls, I'm sure you can do the math if it goes higher.  \n\n\nPositions - 60 June 50c, 15 June 45c, 20 March 40c, 10 March 42.5c, 150 Shares.", "id": "lxxnws", "created_utc": 1614898250.0, "score": 59, "upvote_ratio": 0.69, "num_comments": 68, "comments": [{"body": "Fucking delete this so I can be rich", "score": 50, "replies": [{"body": "Hey, it's still up almost an hour later!\n\nMods must be sleep.", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "Your right, I'll edit with more DD when I get home", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "i'll take it", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "I'm sure it will be gone in less than 10 minutes.", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "Adding to my paper trade account.

Before the market topped on Feb 19th-Feb 20th 2020, all 4 of those banks were trading at the following prices:  \n\n\n* JPM Closed @ 137.49 on Feb 19th '20.

If we assume that banks are on the rise, and we see that 2 of the 4 have surpassed their 1 year ago price already we see opportunity to say \"Hey, if I buy WFC options, targeting their 1 year ago price, how much money would I make if they get there\".
