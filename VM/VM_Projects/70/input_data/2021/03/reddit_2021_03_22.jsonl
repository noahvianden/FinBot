Oh and my personal advice, don't use debit strategies with options unless you are fully confident in your skills (and even then...), they're lottery tickets not investments.\n\nTo answer your question about what percentage is reasonable. Beating the SPY average is difficult for most new traders. If you're using risky strategies and you get lucky, you can blow that away, but if you keep doing it you'll blow up your account.
