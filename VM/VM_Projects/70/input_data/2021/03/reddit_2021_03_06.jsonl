{"title": "Which ETF should I choose for long term? (10-15+ years)", "selftext": "\nSo I have landed a solid job in my career and finally have money to invest in. I’m going to be playing with stocks alittle, but I’m also planning to build a solid nest egg out of a long term index-based fund. After tons of research, I’ve narrowed down my top 3 to be (in order):\n\nVTI (Vanguard Total Market)\n\nIVV (iShares S&P 500)\n\nVOO (Vanguard S&P 500)\n\nMy main criteria were low expense ratios (these are all at 0.03%), stability, and longevity. I like VTI more than VOO because VOO wasn’t started until 2010, so it’s lifetime yield isn’t a good comparison since it missed the 08-09 crash. VTI has slightly better gains than IVV over its lifetime, but IVV has had better short-term growth. IVV and VOO also had better dividend yields.\n\nMy brain is honestly fried going over all the numbers and I just want to know if it really matters all that much which of the three I choose. Is VTI a good investment over the other two? Is there a better long-term fund I haven’t listed? Any advice is welcome, I’m just trying to make the smart move.\n\nEdit: I’ve gotten great advice so far, thank you very much, but people need to stop spamming Ark etfs. You clearly didn’t read the low expense ratio part. No chance am I paying 0.75% for such a volatile etf. 0.10% is the highest I’m willing to go.", "id": "lyu64n", "created_utc": 1615005624.0, "score": 52, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 69, "comments": [{"body": "Welcome to r/stocks!\n\nFor stock recommendations please see our portfolio sticky, sort by hot, it's the first sticky, or see [past portfolio stickies here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+%22Rate+My+Portfolio%22+-+r%2FStocks+Quarterly+Thread&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all)\n\nFor beginner advice, brokerage info, book recommendations, even advanced topics and more, please read our [Wiki here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index)\n\nIf you're wondering **why a stock moved** a certain way, check out [Finviz](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=spy) which aggregates the most news for almost every stock, but also see [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/), and even [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/).\n\nAlso include *some* [due diligence](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/duediligence.asp) to this post or it may be removed if it's low effort.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Whether it be a shiny piece of debris from a fallen alien space craft observing our primal trading behavior or that rock we use to strike other rock to make fire - running towards the unknown is the only way to advance the ape society.\n\nWell the new shiny thing is here and it’s going to propel this group of retards to Alpha Centauri.\n\nRoblox ($RBLX) is going public in a DPO (Direct Public Offering) this Wednesday. Wall Street is already clamoring to get their hands on this child’s game, but this DPO is aimed at retail investors. A DPO prevents insiders from Gathering up all the shares before they hit the market giving every ape or suit equal chance to rinse the gains from this dying hunk of gaming garbage. It’s considered the hottest opportunity of the month and will definitely be trending on every “Top Gainers” list this week. Time to light the match on this momentum and set off the rockets 🧨 🧨🧨\n\nThis is our opportunity to use our collective might to buy up all the stock of a company we believe has value, right at market open driving the price to the moon, once again handing Melvin his 🍑 once he has started shorting the stock. That’s when we HODL because we like the stock.\n\nThis is NOT a short squeeze - it’s far better. It’s rolling the dice on our dick. Doubling down on 00 at the roulette table so we can finally draw our wife’s attention away from that hunk chad she’s been staring at at a table nearby.\n\nCall the waitress over - “round of shots on me.” You don’t care that it’s a gamble you’re all in because the thrill of losing it all is the only thing that makes that chode tingle. \n\nInstead of waiting for a squeeze you’ll know if you’re debt free or a slave to Melvin by market close. Wall streets calling for 5x. I’m telling those suits to hold my beer. 5x is for pussies. I’m going to alpha Centauri or am going to crash and burn.\n\nIdc how bad of a game Roblox is, I will never let Wall Street think they’re gamers. We’re gamers and we’re going to buy ever last share offered and turn that $29b market cap into $infinite$ tendies.\n\n3.10.21 - tattoo it on your jacking hand so you don’t forget.\n\nSell your Pokémon cards. Liquidate your child’s college fund. Refuse to buy the monster at the Walmart self check out line.
