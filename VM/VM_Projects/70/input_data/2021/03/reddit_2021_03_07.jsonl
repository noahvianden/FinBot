Because to expect Tesla to match Amazon's success is hardly conservative.  That's the best case.  To me the closest analogy I can think of for Tesla's leadership in the market is Cisco Systems at the height of the dotcom era and the birth of the internet.\n\nCisco Systems, which dominates the networking market, and is a leader in things like cyber security, was the darling of a major technological shift.  In 1999 they we're the most valuable company in the world, and were seen as can't miss.  They had a technological edge on a piece of technology, that was driving the connection of the internet, with a clear roadmap to branch out into other higher margin areas.

{"title": "Chips w/ the Dip: The Semiconductor Market Crash", "selftext": "You don't get a short version. I'll bold words for you. **$SOXS**. **Put options on consumer electronics.** \n\nTwo weeks ago Biden ordered a 100-day review to address ***supply chain*** issues causing a semiconductor chip shortage in the US. Keyword here is **supply chain**. \n\nI'm predicting that what comes of this is: the US prioritizes imports of semiconductor chips to what it deems essential: primarily, **automakers**. That is - **not consumer electronics**.\n\nAlright, so some background. Manufacturing of semiconductor chips globally:\n\n1990:  37% produced in the US\n\n2021:  12% produced in the US\n\n2030:  6% produced in the US\n\nThe US **can not produce** for the chip demand. You could throw a hundred billion dollars at this problem, and still wouldn't see chip capacity returns for 5 years.\n\nThree years ago, Taiwan (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.) announced it was investing $20b to build a new semiconductor plant. Nov 2019 construction started. Dec 2020 construction was complete (with increased costs due to overtime for construction). Factory prep and production equipment is going to take 12-18 more months, with capacity coming online in Q3-Q4 of 2022 / Q1 2023. **Total time to production: 5 years.** \n\n[Image from WaPo article; google image search to find the source, not linking it 🖕](https://preview.redd.it/r2bd5puvinl61.png?width=1030&format=png&auto=webp&s=7085922833647369ead5ed2e352a1b7101ed18d0)\n\nSo, all these chips are made in Asia - how is the US going to manage the chip shortage. By limiting imports to specific industries. Consumer electronics are not going to be a priority. \n\nFrom the Washington Post (I hate the Washington Post):\n\nThe sanctions \\[US to Chinese telecommunications giants Huawei and Z T E\\] kicked off a domino effect as the Chinese giants stockpiled chips, prompting others to do the same.\n\n“A lot of companies started to hoard”.\n\nA T S M C spokeswoman pointed to the company’s Jan. 28 statement that called addressing the auto chip shortage “our top priority.”\n\nBack to the keyword: supply chain. You might think - oh! Chip shortage, Biden is going to give them an investment. I should go buy US chip companies. No. What about ticker T S M C, the company making that $20b plant, surely their stock will triple. No. Did 3 M Company stock triple with the mask shortage? No. \n\nAvoided using company tickers that are the opposite of this play. You don't get a short version. I don't know what T L D R means and I won't look it up - in my head I always read it as \"The Long Story, Short\". \n\nT L S S: **I like my chips with the dip. $SOXS**. **Put options on consumer electronics.** \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lolv3hpfpnl61.png?width=645&format=png&auto=webp&s=7de87253984ba398df2b32bc5a1b554f72ea2480\n\n^(Not professional, legal, financial advice.
