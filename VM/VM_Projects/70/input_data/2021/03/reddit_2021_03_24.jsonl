I am sharing mine below. Just apply it to some companies with good capitalization that won't go bankrupt and it's easy money.

Simple moving average from last 200 weeks (blue on the screen) and min/max price from last 200 weeks (yellow on the screen). All these indicators are used for really is to determine expensive and cheap prices.\n\nHow to use it?\n\n1. Split ur total investment money into 2-3 piles.\n2. Invest one pile per 3-5 months (this protects you from putting all money in before long bear market).\n3. Invest 1/2 of a pile when the price goes below W1 SMA(200) - blue line\n4. Invest the other 1/2 of a pile when the price goes below W1 MIN(200) - bottom yellow line\n5. No matter if you invested 1/2 or whole pile, sell 1/3 of investment when the price goes above W1 MAX(200) - top yellow line\n6. Hold the remaining 2/3 of positions until you are happy with profit (up to you).\n\nYou can see example entries here: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/uySEqjQE/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/uySEqjQE/)\n\nThis strategy is for investments lasting 3-5 years. Never sell a losing investment!\n\nThis is a very good money-making strategy, but you probably won't be able to execute it because:  \na) you won't be patient enough - sometimes the chance to enter with this strat may appear even only once a year on a given stock  \nb) you will be scared to buy when the time comes - when the price will be at the levels where you should buy, Reddit and other social media will be in panic mode - you must have balls to ignore them\n\nThis should be used on assets that are growing since forever (top stocks, whatever meets the condition really).\n\nIf you are using it you easily can ignore the news, Reddit, and other social media.

{"title": "China’s Housing Crisis", "selftext": "BTW, this is based off a yt video by polymatter. can’t post link or post will be banned. \n\nChina's Housing Crisis\n\n***Disclaimer****: I have no positions in any foreign or Chinese business or commodity. This is my own opinion and I do not give financial advice. Use all of this information at your own risk, this is not financial advice.* \n\nalso btw this is not entirely my own research, I just turned it into text format. *Please fact check for any misinformation.* \n\nOk, now lets get down to the weeds. I am not making a TLDR, someone in the comments can do that, this post is for brains with many wrinkle. \n\nTo get started, lets look at a case study, the Chinese city of Ordos. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[City of Ordos, Inner Mongolia, China](https://preview.redd.it/v0otrz168fo61.png?width=1300&format=png&auto=webp&s=ec18aed063a49a058a2a4e8cf7607eb5631d44d5)\n\nFrom afar, this city looks like any other, and this stock photo, makes it looks like it active like any other emerging city. The City of Ordos, like many other cities in China, are pre-planned from the ground up. **Ordos was built to house and serve 1,000,000 people. However, Ordos only has 150,000 people (according to the government).** After natural resources were found near the city in the early 2000s, there was a plan to expand the city. The gov't built housing, schools, hospitals, museums, and public art. **The only things missing, which you might interpret as very important for a city are, supermarkets, department stores, and bars. hmmmmm... kinda sus...** \n\nHere's where it gets better, **even though the city is only has 15% of its designed capacity living there, nearly 100% of the housing units are owned by citizens.** I believe the majority of these owners have no intention of ever moving into these homes because the city literally has nothing to do in it. (no bars, super markets, stores). It would be impossible to live in the city comfortably. \n\nOrdos is not the only city in China like this. If we look at vacancy rates (across all of China), we can see a troubling pattern. \n\n|Year|Vacancy rate|\n|:-|:-|\n|2013|20.9%|\n|2015|21.7%|\n|2017|22.6%|\n\nWhat's even crazier is the fact that 1/5 of all urban homes, or 65 million homes are vacant. \n\n**China has a housing crisis, that may be worse than 2008.** \n\nOk now that we have established a growing problem, lets travel back in time. China is a growing nation that is developing its economy at lighting speed. The way they accomplished this was by proving cheap labor, and manufactuing items for very cheap, and selling them. This is how they grew their GDP so quickly. The problem with provision cheap labor is that it also means your population is working for low wages. You can only compare with the entire world economy for so long before wages naturally start to rise, an your products become less competitive. That is why much of the manufacturing has moved to other Asian countries. **I believe the only way for China to effectively continue to grow it's GDP is by ecourging consumer spending.** There is little left to invest in( roads, bridges, airports etc, that provide instant good returns). The government is constrained by the amount they collect in taxes and debt (around 40% income tax rates). The only way left for China to improve their GDP is i by increasing consumer spending. In order for that to happen, consumers need to gain trust, and spend their savings. **At the current moment, 32% of GDP is consumer spending.** Below is a chart that compare that number to other countries:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Country|% of GDP (consumption) (2017)|\n|:-|:-|\n|USA|\\~75%|\n|UK|\\~68%|\n|Japan|\\~60%|\n|Germany|\\~58%|\n|Korea|\\~49%|\n|China|32%|\n\nAnother bad sign for China is that consumption as a percentage of GDP has actually been decreasing, not increasing. **In 1995 it was around 50% of GDP, now it is only 32%.**\n\nThere may be many reasons for this decline. China does not have a good Social Security system. Citizens need to save for themselves, and thereof are less likely to spend their hard earned cash on anything not essential. Income tax is also very high. In some parts of the country, the effective tax rate can be as high as 40% or more, which is insane. So, in order to preserve wealth, where do the people look to, you guesses it, HOUSING!!! Data to back this up is by looking at home ownership rates, and comparing them to other wealthy nations. Here is another handy dandy chart:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Country|Home Ownership Rate|\n|:-|:-|\n|China|90%|\n|Singapore|\\~88%|\n|Mexico|\\~70%|\n|Australia|\\~64%|\n|Canada|\\~62%|\n|USA|\\~60%|\n\nWhat's even more concerning is the fact that a majority of the recent home purchases are for second and third homes. If this rings a bell, look back to the early 2000s USA. Here is a graph representing home purchases in Urban China. \n\n[Percent of home purchases by purchase number. ](https://preview.redd.it/7knr02hqffo61.png?width=1504&format=png&auto=webp&s=7722e062b2732978ee28348fbe0d8c8cee70e0b4)\n\nNow this begs the question, if everyone is owns multiple homes, who is going to live in them. And the answer is... well... no one. Not a soul. This is proven by the vacancy rates shown above. Comparing vacancy rates to other countries will show the true picture of the problem at hand. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Country|Vacancy rate|\n|:-|:-|\n|Spain|28%|\n|China|22%|\n|France|17%|\n|USA|13%|\n|Denmark|13%|\n|Canada|8%|\n\nSince China opened up the housing market to the public, it has been the number one asset class to store wealth in. I mean just look at this graph:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Make sure to note currency is in Yuan, not USD](https://preview.redd.it/42kroij5hfo61.png?width=1950&format=png&auto=webp&s=a33f1d2f5788766c06e5d335248b220f2c3967cb)\n\nThe reason for this, besides all the info above, is that the public has no trust in the stock market because it is so volatile, and no one likes bonds, well because they're fucking bonds and give no meaningful return, so no one buys them. This leaves only housing for people to store their money in. **Also, China's demographics are going to bite them in the ass, and bite them HARD.** Because of the one child policy, **China has an ever increasing population,** with not enough young people to support them. Also, because of the dame policy, there is an embalmed of the sexes. **Men out number Women by millions.** \n\n[Population Chart, Men on Left, Women on Right](https://preview.redd.it/tbk2e573ifo61.png?width=1672&format=png&auto=webp&s=6efbfa9fdde9a6a4836e56fee15e3018092fca3e)\n\nBecause of this imbalance, the Women in China have been able to get very picky with their men. T**hey can almost demand that they have fancy cars, watches, jewelry, and of course, HOUSES.** Its almost a prerequisite to own a house in order to get married. Imagine if you manage to find some dream girl, and she turns you down just because, you do not own a house. This forces men to you guesses it, buy houses. Home ownership studies prove this by comparing home ownership rates, with the sex imbalance. In cities where there is a greater imbalance of Men to Women, housing prices are higher. Around 30% of home sales are solely attributed to men wanting to get married. **And men are getting desperate to buy these homes.** Men are increasingly buying homes that have not even been built yet. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n1nnikeejfo61.png?width=1844&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff352aeea3da8c4ef060f6f64bb20d09d0d00c71\n\nImagine spending money on a home, that has not even been built yet. This is a sign that there may be a bubble, and a dangerously large bubble. **The frenzied home buying is a sign the housing market is speculative,** not based on reality. Because these retards believe the housing prices will only go up (like our stocks), they will put down any amount of money necessary to buy these homes. The problem is  China's demographics (they're getting way too fucking old). **China's over 55 age group will increase by 120 million** (or you know, the entire population of fucking japan). By the end of century, the overall population of china will be halved. **The majority of home buyers right now are aged between 20 and 50. Otherwise known as the segment that will turn into the old people.** There will be fewer people around(low supply), and this round of new old people will have drastically different needs than the current cohort. 10 years ago rapid urbanization would bring enough migrants into the city to keep housing prices rising (high demand). This max influx of migrants was canceling the effects of aging(lower demand) on the housing market. The thing is, today the urban growth rate is shrinking, and the people moving, on average are older than before. Because the growth rate is droppings, and the people moving are older, the effects of migration propping up the housing market are shrinking. And to add fuel to the fire, it is getting increasingly harder to find jobs, which is forcing people to move out back into the country(negative effect in housing prices). **Supply is going to catch up with demand, and it is not going to be pretty when it happens.** \n\nhmm... this all sounds pretty bad, but so what if china's housing market crashes? how will that effect me, and more importantly how can i make some tendies in the process. \n\nto that I say hold your horses, we haven't even gotten to the worst part yet. \n\n**For some context, in China, housing directly contributes to 15% of GDP. This metric signifactly under calculates it's importance in their economy. When everything related to real estate is accounted for, 30% of GDP is related to real estate. 30 FUCKING PERCENT OF CHINA'S GDP IS CORRELATED WITH HOUSING!!! WHAT THE FUCKKKKKKK!!!!!!** For comparison, because everything needs a comparison in order to put in perspective what is going on, here is a graph that compares real estate-related spending to a percent of GDP. \n\n[read the title dipshit](https://preview.redd.it/lmto6mncnfo61.png?width=1636&format=png&auto=webp&s=cba8296eb607641e34b15636d0e68c3a3d88cc2f)\n\nChina's largest banks : *Bank of China*, *Industrial and Commercial Bank of China*, and *Agricultural Bank of China*, all have mortgages on their books. They are all heavily dependent on these mortgages. A 20% drop in real estate related activities could lead to a drop of 5-10% in GDP. **Basically, China is over exposed to the housing market.** according to the IMF(lol), **if China's demand for housing drops just by 1%, global GDP could drop by .25%, which is a lot.** There is one thing that cannot be ignored, in the US before 2008, people were taking out loans with no down payment, this is very different in China. For fist homes, a down payment averages around 30%, and for second homes it can be as high as a 70% down payment. Also, people are not being given shitty loans like in the US. Instead, people are saving up their own money, sacrificing everything, to buy these homes. Now this is a sign that there may actually not be a 2008 level event, but that does not mean it is not healthy for the Chinese economy. Because everyone is buying these 2nd and 3rd homes that they willl never use, that money is not being spent on innovation, manufacturing, and other economic drivers. **Because banks have so much housing as collateral, they cannot give loans out to companies that would use the capital too innovate.**  \n\nAnd, to put Elon musk's spaceship flames right over the already gigantic shitshow fire, Local governments could default as well. Because local governments are responsible for providing care, but don't really collect taxes(all tax revenue goes to Beijing), **they created shell companies called LGFVs to generate revenue.** The local governments technically own all of the land, so they created these shell companies to take on debt for the local governments. The government gave the LGFVs free land, so they could get loans to pay for all the care they are required to give by Beijing. The LGFVs can take out loans from banks, using the land as collateral. **This separates the debt from the local governments, but in reality they are in massive debt, and if housing prices fall, they could default on these loans.** \n\nSo basically there are 2 scenarios that I can think of:\n\n**Scenario 1: Housing prices fall**\n\nIn this scenario, by natural forces of supply and demand caused by the disastrous one child policy, Housing prices begin to fall, leading to a 2008 level event where basically everything is worthless. This would not only fuck over China, but the entire world's economy, just like in 2008 with the US. Local governments will also lose around 30% of their revenue due to LGVF's no longer being able to take out loans with land as collateral. \n\n**Scenario 2: Housing prices do not fall**\n\nIn this scenario, China is still fucked, just not the rest of the world so much. Instead of everyone paying the price, China's people will pay the most. If housing prices continue to rise, it will be harder for farmers and low income individuals to move into cities and join civilization. China needs these low income people to continue moving into cities in order for housing prices to keep rising, but at some point, no one will be able to afford these houses. Also, there will be million of men that will have no hope of marrying because they cannot find a house to buy. \n\nThe only counter argument i can think of is that China's government is so powerful, they could instantly implement reforms that would solve the crisis. The only thing is, will they? They have a history of failures like the one child policy. **And they could end up fucking it up even more trying to intervene.** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, how do us reatrds profit.
