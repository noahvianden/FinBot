{"title": "NrdRage's Friday DD: Spring is in the air - the birds are singing, the flowers are BLOOMing, and there's money to be made off Texas freezing and fixing our EOL power infrastructure ($BE)", "selftext": "Happy Friday all, NrdRage here.   You might remember me from such green energy hits as \"$CLNE will make you rich\", \"$FCEL is about to rip\", and \"$RIOT is environmentally friendly because you aren't actually digging for digital coins so you have plausible deniability\".  Today, I'd like to talk to all of you about an incredibly sneaky green REDUNDANCY play that, following the Texas freeze and CA's annual \"we're out of juice\" saga, is likely to become more in demand.  I present to you:  Bloom Energy ($BE)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# The New Normal (disruption)\n\nWhether you're a believer in climate change or a denier of it, one thing we can all agree on is that extreme weather patterns  (by view of our short lifespans) are becoming more and more frequent, whether you think it's because that's just how things go or if cow farts are going to doom us all. Weather related damage to life, liberty, and the pursuit of tendies is now averaging 22 billion dollars a year in the United States absent of cost to infrastructure disruptions, with power disruption phenomena contributing to over 50,000 deaths per year.  As we continue to evolve and become more reliant upon technology, distributed data platforms, IoT, EVs, robot surgeons, etc., disruptions in access to power render us completely impotent to function as a society.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Our crumbling infrastructure:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks to the Boomers who have been wasting our immense wealth on blow, being able to see the pimples on Jenna Jameson's ass in 20 year old videos while they flaccidly beat off in their office, and in general fucking everything in this world up, the American Society of Civil Engineers has given our power grid infrastructure a D-minus grade.  Not only are there many single points of failure, the grid we presently have was only rated for 50 years of service, and a huge percentage of it is well beyond that expected lifespan.  Meanwhile, our consumption demands have increased exponentially and will continue to do so both as our population expands due to a combination of your wife's boyfriend continually getting her pregnant (or open border policies, whichever you believe in) as well as our fucked up attempts to become the Jetsons.  These are streams that should not be crossed, but we're doing it anyways because we're in the early stages of the Idiocracy documentary.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Enter $BE.  So what do these guys do?  The 3 R's:  Resiliency, Redundancy, and Retardedness\n\nFirst, let's get one thing out of the way:  These guys are NOT primarily a play on replacing municipal infrastructure with green energy like solar or wind farms for large capacity energy production.  That's a crowded space, and they'd be a bad competitor there.  What they are a play on is providing MICROGRIDS for critical infrastructure to ensure continuous power delivery to essential services.  Their product provides RESILIENCY and REDUNDANCY to individual campuses and facilities to ensure that, even in the absolute worst case scenario, the wheels keep turning at vulnerable locales.  Think hospitals, water treatment facilities, nursing homes, airports, etc. at the lower level of Maslow's hierarchy and data centers, shipping hubs and the CEO's 7th vacation villa at the corporate level.  The things that will grind something to a screeching halt in the event of power failure.  The 3rd R is just a reminder that, if you're reading this, you're retarded.  Just thought you might need a reminder.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# OK, HOW do they do it?  What makes them special/different?  Elon says solar and batteries are the futurez, man\n\n&#x200B;\n\n$BE is different than most green energy plays in that they make solid oxide fuel cells they call servers that will convert fuel (usually hydrogen, but they can run on RNG or ethanol, as well) to electricity WITHOUT combustion (that's the big differentiator here).  I won't get too sciency here because you smooth brains wouldn't get it, but it's got electrolytes, and that's what plants crave, bitches.  They require no precious metals (so no shortage concerns).  Each \"server\", which runs about 3/4 of a million dollars a unit, produces 250 kw of juice and can power 1 30,000 square foot commercial space or up to 100 homes.  These servers produce energy at 55% efficiency (for point of comparison, solar is 12%).  They do produce CO2 as waste, but only half as much as natural gas power stations.  When using RNG as the fuel source, they are a net-zero carbon emission product, which is good both for government spending programs to appease the Sierra Club as well as carbon tax dodging companies.  They're also presently burning all their positive cash flow into figuring out how to harness the CO2 these produce to turn it into some other form of energy, which would make them a CARBON NEGATIVE product if they pull it off.  That's Star Trek shit right there. These servers pay for themselves in an average of 3-5 years, making them an attractive long-term investment, especially against the 17 years it takes for solar to pay for itself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMost importantly, they operate completely independently of a power grid and are not subject to adverse weather impacting their functionality (like a solar panel getting covered with snow or temperatures falling so low that nat gas plants and windmills freeze), guaranteeing reliable access to power.  Elon's mega batteries are still constrained by the limitation that power needs to be injected into the batteries and those batteries can be drained.  These fuel cells will always operate and never run out of juice barring a component failure.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**All of this is important because it highlights the fact that $BE has no real competitors on the market for the niche they've filled, and aren't going to be hampered by price increases/hunting for lithium, rare earth metals, chip shortages, etc.  The only comparable company out there is Ballard Power Systems, who is focused more on buses, industrial machinery, trains, etc., not infrastructure.   Ballard is trying to fight in the battery space, which is very crowded.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Fuck you, Mr. Wizard - TENDIES, fucker!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlright, alright, alright.  Chill the fuck out.  I'm sorry your wife didn't peg you last night and now you're surly.  These dudes are gonna make money 4 ways:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* 1 is the human life aspect.  Loss of life is tragic, but let's be honest:  Mostly, it's just bad optics if you're a politician, and what happened in Texas and California threatens political job security.    If they can spend YOUR money to ensure that they can keep TAKING money from you, they're gonna be all ears.  Expect a lot of regulation in the coming years mandating that essential facilities have access to reliable off-grid power in the case of natural disaster, Hungarian hackers or Chinese invaders.  And we can't just have Becky from HR run out to the Generac every 20 minutes to fill it with gas from the Exxon station down the street.  Interns won't blow you if you're working at Wendy's after getting voted out. The fact that it will save lives is just a nice bonus\n* 2 is corporate greed.  It's bad for business to be ground to a halt, and corporations know they can't rely on the government to give them juice.  Most of $BE's money thus far (we'll get to that in a moment) already comes from corporate America.  Companies like $EBAY,  $HD, $WMT, $INTC, $AAPL, $GOOGL, $ORCL, etc. already use these guys to ensure that their data centers and shipping depots are always powered on and operational because just because the apocalypse is here doesn't mean you stop making money.   Secretaries won't blow you in the executive washroom if the board fires you.\n* The 3rd is as an add-on to replacements to our current grid infrastructure to harden it and provide insurance against limited disruptions.  Customers  won't blow you if their nipples are frozen.\n* The 4th is a future product, but as they hone their product and reduce their cost of production, adding a small consumer grade sized server to your home could provide about 1kW of power at a cost of about 3 grand, making it a favorable alternative to a generator or a Tesla wall paired with solar panels.  Your wife won't blow you if....well, let's be honest, she just won't blow you.  Sorry.\n\n# Under the hood:  Financials:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt the time of this writing, $BE is trading at $27.14 with a market cap of 5 billion dollars.  Their 52 week high was $45, and their 52 week low was all the way down at $3.  They were recently dragged down in the broader market correction on the NASDAQ because, even though they're an energy sector play and thus shouldn't have been hit as hard, they're \"tech energy\", so they got pulled down unfairly (right along with last week's DD, $CLNE - you're welcome on that, btw).  Even th ough they have a gross margin of over 25%, they are not a profitable company because they put all of their money into R&D.  They do about a billion dollars in revenue annually and are looking at a growth rate of over 420% in the next 2 years (no, I didn't randomly pick that number off the top of my head, that's where the math leads.  It's a sign, bitches).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf we look at total returns with companies $BE gets lumped in with, we see that they severely lagged in terms of return during this green energy boom:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Making the Tendies](https://preview.redd.it/sbxrlwkrjmm61.png?width=1499&format=png&auto=webp&s=595698334852c429c897a06b30ce5a6334008256)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, there are 2 ways you can look at this:  You can be the bad kind of retarded and say it's a bad investment because  some of these other plays have performed better, or you can be the good kind of retarded and realize that these other plays that outperformed were all in the BATTERY space and that Bloom was overlooked because it plays in infrastructure, and now gets to CATCH UP to the rest of these guys that are already very crowded trades, making you a fuck ton of money.  You want to throw money in something that's already fully vested, or something that's \"got next\"?\n\nWhat's the smart money doing?  Let's take a look at the short interest:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Short interest](https://preview.redd.it/yb6brzpgkmm61.png?width=511&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a24d64a1c40698b7cc63a144f7488828f018c49)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe smart money is getting the fuck out of the way because they know this thing is coiling and is gonna bust a nut all over their faces if they don't.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNormalizing all of their numbers, the price target for this stonk was trending along nicely till the broader market correction the last few weeks.  And these targets were before a light got shone on how shitty our power reliability is\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Stonks only go up](https://preview.redd.it/jxssf1o2lmm61.png?width=495&format=png&auto=webp&s=527a481b906f993df7f6659046875a760421c4ab)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Technical Teabagging:\n\nLooking at the technicals, we see a few things.  First, on the daily it's not the smoothest price action, but we had a nice upwards channel up until the correction, and it's since gone into a descending wedge with a strong bull flag to the upside.  Now if you're looking at this and thinking to yourself \"self, this looks like a very traditional head and shoulders pattern and we've formed the right neckline\", you would be correct looking at the chart blind, but in so doing you would be ignoring the larger market correction that caused the beginning of that pattern to form, which means it'll probably be a broken H&S.  Again, these lines aren't great because I'm too lazy - I usually just eyeball it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Daily](https://preview.redd.it/21azp5m5mmm61.png?width=1207&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6e59b9f8192944a323c329bde077cc52309be70)\n\nExpanding out to a 2 hour 20 day, things get cleaner.  Your light blue line is the 20 day moving average, the dark blue is the 50 day SMA, and the cream line is the 200 SMA.  Descending resistance, ascending support.  It's nearing the end of its coil for a breakout.  The 20 day and 50 MA will very likely be crossing in the near future at that $34 mark.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[20 day 2 hour](https://preview.redd.it/rencp872nmm61.png?width=1593&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff36a5ad641e72f0a6955d4f0c7d9ba3ec7c4857)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# So, to summarize:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* $BE has a lot of tailwinds at its back as the result of the recent infrastructure debacles and the calls for regulation and upgrades to infrastructure, which will only become more frequent as time progresses\n* With a 3-5 year return on investment, these products present an attractive investment to corporations looking to both hedge their bets against corporate incompetence as well as reduce their exposure to carbon tax measures\n* Because their products don't go into EV's and aren't working with supervillains trying to get people to buy joke currency, they were largely left behind in the recent surge in green energy valuations because people largely didn't understand their voodoo or that these guys even existed, but social awareness of them is raising.  Leaving them a lot of room to the upside to run\n* Even though they should have been immune to the broader market selloff as an energy sector play (the energy stonks actually went up during that correction), they got unfairly dragged down because they're still sort of a tech play.  This creates an interesting and attractive buying opportunity, even if this stonk has run a bit since I started touting it in the dailies (as I only do one DD a week, you've missed the absolute bottom, but this is free so fuck you if you want to complain)\n* They're definitely going to be getting some of that gubmit corporate stimmy money to shut AOC up.\n* Microgrids to critical operations such as hospitals, nursing homes, water treatment facilities, etc. are going to become a big thing and very likely an architectural standard in the future\n* **They have zero competition in the space they reside in, which is really fucking unusual**\n* There's a long play here by which these things could be attractive power assurance features to new home builds or as retrofits, particularly in parts of the country where natural disasters and adverse weather frequently affect access to electricity\n* They're immune to weather phenomena (and actually operate better in colder weather), making them an attractive power resiliency option\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Price Targets:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs I've said multiple times, this stonk was positively FLYING as it caught up to $PLUG, $FCEL, etc. in the sector as people became more aware of it as a value play.  Couple that with the tailwinds it now has as a result of a shitty winter and never ending California wildfires.  A short term price target of $32 by mid April is a bet I'd have 70% conviction on.  Barring continued market manipulation because of Boomer bonds, 45-50 by mid summer, and a long term price target (given their growth projections) of $72 are entirely within reach.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# How do you play it?:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou can actually FD this one, if you really want to.  This thing has a very standard behavior:  It tends to pop at the open and then fades into the day.  Further, if you time that coil right, you can experience a really nice breakout on a weekly.  Personally, I like the 5/21 32cs at anything under $4 and I was buying the shit out of them during the correction, but that's just because my brain still has like 3 wrinkles in it that I can't seem to iron out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne thing to note is this is not a high volume stonk.  Only about 35000 shares will trade hands near the open, and options interest is low enough to where if you're playing with a big bankroll, filling a large order will take time.  As such, the spreads tend to be pretty wide on this guy, so you're going to want to manually enter something that's 10 cents above the current offer price and babysit it till its filled.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Position Disclaimers:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm balls deep in these guys, and have been since early November of last year when I purchased most of the shares my VC had from funding them a decade ago to my personal accounts as we shifted the nature of our portfolio.  Since that time, I've only added to my positions on the options chain.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* 263,800 shares @ $14\n* 2000 5/21 32c's at an average cost basis of 2.60\n* 1000 1/22 60c's at 3 even\n* 500 1/22 65c's at 2.70\n\nI'd like to say my position is fully vested, but I've been buying every single fucking dip on this one.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll my love,\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-Chad Dickens", "id": "m3mhkm", "created_utc": 1615570104.0, "score": 152, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 73, "comments": [{"body": "Followed your $CLNE DD last week and the stock is already up like 45%.

They have good R&D spend at around $64M if you discount for their stock option accounting, but R&D is definitely not the reason for their lack of profitability, SG&A is pretty substantial. Interest expense decreasing but still a material drag on profits. Taking out all their stock options, they almost broke even on their EBITDA. Year over year sales growth looks to be around 20-30% (excluding 2020 which has been rough for everyone) and even taking into account increasing demand I find it hard to get to 400%+ growth over the next few years. I am pretty retarded and can barely read an income statement, hell i can barely read at all, so my numbers are probably off somewhere.
