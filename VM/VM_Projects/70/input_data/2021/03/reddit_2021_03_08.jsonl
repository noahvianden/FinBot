{"title": "Journey to $1 Million, Week of March 8th", "selftext": "(These are highly debated topics and I would love to hear your opinions)\n\nAnother painful week for tech and growth, I might as well just copy and paste what for last week's \"What to Watch\" - \n\n\"Last week was a painful one as the Nasdaq, tech and semiconductors retreated the most as bond interest rates rose and money shifted into post-pandemic stocks. Towards the end of the week, even the Dow Jones took a hit. Friday we saw bond yields cool off and the $QQQ saw a half of a percent gain.\"\n\nThe ten year treasury is up more and it is seemingly having a negative affect on our beloved tech and growth stocks. The only thing up is financial sector, which would supposedly benefit from high interest rates, and oil. Don't be fooled, in my opinion, this is a sign that our current dip will be short lived. \n\n* **Financial** and **Energy** will be most disrupted with the new innovation.\n* This is a good time to buy tech, growth and innovation.  \n* We are not in a bubble. (my opinion)\n\nThe current length and slope of the September dip, which this cool off is being compared to all the time, is the same now. We might be in for one more red day if this is somewhat correlated. It might not be - take it with a grain of salt. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/15btxxwmfpl61.png?width=433&format=png&auto=webp&s=0204563b9e2c805e8146ff7fd3004610aace5256\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2ig8pglnfpl61.png?width=529&format=png&auto=webp&s=18765402a650fd7a8568ab27f3b9ded1679e478e\n\n Nevertheless, keep this in mind.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/te8vvuoofpl61.png?width=1018&format=png&auto=webp&s=037edbd963533ae2fcf28713a7eb4f557bc14d99\n\n \n\nThe retail investors, the mom and pops, and the working mothers that are looking toward the stock market for secondary income will be the most affected from a dip like this. Eventually many people can't take the loss anymore and will cut their positions at the bottom. They can't afford to lose everything and not be able to feed their kids, meanwhile hedge funds and money managers seem to have endless money to keep buying the plummeting market. \n\nI do feel like there is an uptick in online sentiment about buying tech and growth. However, I do believe that the ten year treasury will hit 2%. As you can see from the TNX chart below, the yield goes up and down periodically. This isn't something new and or surprising. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rq7bv6qpfpl61.png?width=1018&format=png&auto=webp&s=d2acf2ae870998b7eacdadd41e2085487d0bc16e\n\nWhat is surprising is the overall agreement that this is somehow correlated to the decline in tech. Below is the QQQ (orange line), or NASDAQ ETF, that is tech heavy and the candle stick chart is the TNX (10 year treasury yield). As you can see, sometimes the QQQ goes up and the TNX goes down. Sometimes both go up or both go down. And sometimes QQQ is down and the TNX is up.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l6t5knhrfpl61.png?width=452&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d37548f59b0f16367c4589a3def0f6319243a00\n\n \n\nThe argument is that these tech companies will be hurt from rising interest rates, but I wouldn't expect it would be so much. Opening the economy will help travel and leisure and the in person retail will improve. However, I don't buy for a minute that now that consumers are use to ordering everything online due to lockdowns, that they won't continue to do this and go back to big box, leaving behind online shopping as the past. This time is over, in my opinion. Covid helped innovation and disruptive stocks get some sort of a jump start and I don't see this rolling back. Look to the future for what will disrupt the norm now. Look for things that will totally change how we live everyday life. Don't follow benchmarks of the past. \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nIf you haven't already listened to Cathie Wood's [interview from March 5th](https://ark-invest.com/videos/market-commentary/march-5-2021-in-the-know-with-cathie-wood/), I highly recommend it. \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**With that said, these are the tickers I'm looking to next week.** \n\n***Continuing the Dip:***\n\n$**ERX**: ERX provides 2x leveraged exposure to the S&P Energy Select Sector Index—a market-cap-weighted index of US energy companies from the S&P 500, heavily-weighted towards the handful of firms that dominate the energy sector. With oil prices rising since late last year, there is a decent opportunity to buy this for short term play to capture some profits during this dip. Not to mention $ERX has a dividend yield of 1.24%.\n\n$**GUSH**: GUSH seeks to deliver 200% of the daily performance of the S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production Select Industry Index. Unlike State Street’s XOP—an unlevered fund tracking the same index—GUSH uses over-the-counter derivatives to achieve its objective. $GUSH doesn't provide as good as a dividend so I am bias toward $ERX. I've noticed that the performance over the past two weeks has been more or less the same. \n\n$**FAS**: FAS provides 3x leveraged exposure to the Russell 100 Financial Services Index—a subset consisting of large-cap financial companies from the Russell 1000 Index. For example some of the top holdings are Berkshire Hathaway, JPMorgan, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Black Rock, and Goldman Sachs. With rising bond yields the financial sector has been doing pretty well over the last two weeks. If the dip continues into next, I expect this to be a good short term play. More so it is not bad to have exposure to the financial sector in your portfolio.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uqlmrroufpl61.png?width=1018&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b7a7b8c1d43669c361ec72b52a66f9aa1c2d5ed\n\n \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n***Buying the Dip:*** \n\n$**TSLA**: Tesla, the leader in the Electric Vehicle, battery and autonomous driving industry, is having a 30% sale and Cathie Wood's Ark Invest is buying it up. Remember, only buy the dip if you can see yourself holding these stocks for 5-20 years. If so, then it isn't a problem to see them fall a little. $TSLA is holding up on the 180MA, usually a very strong support. Let's see what next week has in store. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/djepah1xfpl61.png?width=1018&format=png&auto=webp&s=722117fb3844a3d7f201b7a605c89249cc14e485\n\n$**BUZZ**: VanEck Vectors Social Sentiment ETF (the “Fund”) seeks to track as closely as possible, before fees and expenses, the price and yield performance of the BUZZ NextGen AI US Sentiment Leaders Index (the “Sentiment Leaders Index”). I think this new ETF can hold up rather well during a dip and hopefully capture good growth. It is to new to perform TA on, but I'm interested in buying $BUZZ's top holdings anyway. I can't find any major 'meme stock' holdings in it.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9cfy1880gpl61.png?width=650&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb9de2b4c90719cb5ff18589bc51b7a452a8b3fe\n\n$**SOXL/$TECL**: Both of these 3X bull ETFs have obviously taken huge hits over the last two weeks. That doesn't scare me off, and in fact I will be buying more. Not often do we get such chances. With such huge dips, that only means there is more room for growth going forward. Eventually the 10 year will get priced into the market and growth, tech and innovation will have money flowing back into them.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l49igzs1gpl61.png?width=1018&format=png&auto=webp&s=b3461f179587cb0fbe210d7f01d9613207b402e2\n\n$**ARK Invest ETF**s: Most of the ARK ETFs have also approached the 180MA on the day candle stick chart. I believe that this cool off will be short lived and this provides us a great chance to buy into innovation. I wouldn't invest my entire portfolio into ARK ETFs, however, I am very interested in DCA into more LEAPS on these very soon.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/moltpkg3gpl61.png?width=1018&format=png&auto=webp&s=f0694d1cb3dc2342ed3c84aba06691ba955f699c\n\n$**SPCX**: SPCX is the first actively-managed Special Purpose Acquisitions Corporations (SPACs) ETF in the market. The fund seeks capital appreciation by holding a broad portfolio of SPACs or “blank check” companies and firms that have completed their initial public offering (IPO) within the last two years. I've invested in a lot of SPACs year to date, and there is a lot of information to digest, remember, and act on. Depending on the management, this could make that all very easy. After all, SPACs are beating the S&P500. Tread carefully here! I recommend dollar cost averaging only a few shares per day.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7nl3ejt4gpl61.png?width=1018&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe0c8adf709cdfa3bc7507580ba12459f0df4fb3\n\n$**RBLX**: Roblox (NYSE:RBLX), an online gaming platform created in 2004, allows users to design and create multiplayer games and share them with friends and other users. Roblox offers a free-to-play multiplayer program supported through in-game purchases using “Robux,” the platform’s digital currency. There is a lot of excitement about this IPO. I will be watching it closely. A lot of times early investors take this time to sell off shares.  \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nAs for the 'buying the dip picks', I'd dollar cost average into them every other day, no matter up or down.

Some people need meaning in life and structure, and how people get it, whether in religion or secularism, is fine by me. There are lot worse things to believe in than atheism or religion. \n\nThat being said, personally speaking, taking out the outdated or archaic beliefs of religions and focusing on the basic tenants of what some of its philosophy teaches, there are some good beliefs to live by.

I'd say the worst thing Atheism does is inspire a best selling hitpiece on the sacred cow du jour. Remember Missionary Position?\n\nThat being said, pesonally speaking, I still want Christ out of my money management. Boiling religion down to philosophy is disingenuous and dislocated from what religion actually is, as though religion is not alive and well and fully animated in affairs domestic and global.

In fact when I walk around major cities many of those religious groups do a lot of good for those in need.  I’m not going to judge them if their net impact on communities improve people’s lives.\n\nI have never considered the net impact on communities of Atheism. I am not sure if or how Atheism improves communities, I have never seen it significantly organized to do soup kitchens or help the poor. That would be an interesting area to explore.\n\nI’m not seeing Christ in Woods methods other than her utilizing faith as a cornerstone of her character and personal constitution. That is no different than an atheist using his own personal convictions to sustain his professional endeavours. \n\nLastly I can hardly believe that you would sit there and read the history and culture of civilizations that have existed since ancient days, such as in Egypt and Mesopotamia, and not delineate that many religions encompassed not just origin stories, but laws, ethics, codes, and philosophy in their writings.  It is not a difficult concept to extract those areas, and there is learnings there that should be read and learned from rather than outright dismissed as meh, religion.

That's why it's the good example and that's why I chose it. You can say that it's the \"worse (sic) possible example on the spectrum\" but you'd be wrong. Its simplicity makes it the best and clearest example as to why an areligious life is morally superior to the one that relies on gods and churches for life tenets. Nobody's being put to death by atheists, and that's precisely why you haven't found stone throwing in every corner of North America, not thru the benevolence of good-hearted religious folk. It's also why you see capital punishment recede the farther we push from conservatism in America-- conservatism is twinned with religious conviction, often blood-thirsty. It's the beauty of the Enlightenment you describe, not the virtue of the religious. I am disappointed you would try to cheapen my argument as so simple \"anyone debating\" could do it, but that's your choice.\n\nTo find the net impact on communities through atheism, just look into statistics for the form 990, which all secular philanthropic bodies and non-religious NGOs have  to file with the IRS. Religious institutions do nothing of the sort, and accurate data on their giving cannot be found because it is self reported and has black box protection. While 7 in 10 dollars in this country go to church collection plates, it is very important to understand that churches are under no obligation to dispense their coffers back into the community. They can mount luxury legal defenses if needed (see Catholic church child rape scandal), and the idea that they operate with humanitarian goals first is really unsupported, and assumes a lot, especially when one considers that most parishes are broke... However, even when rich, they can be famously unhelpful. Joel Osteen didn't allow the refugees of Hurricane Hardy into Lakewood, for example, when all they needed was shelter during a historic flood. If you're really interested in finding out more, again, seek that form 990 data. I think you will find  that the vast bulk of filing NGOs, working to enrich communities, are areligious organizations.\n\nI see Christ in Cathie Woods' methods in that she has openly and vocally made peace with the risky nature of her \"creative capital assignments\" as investments made to their best and highest use according to her relationship with \"Christ the Redeemer\" and by the will of the holy spirit. She is quite explicit in podcast and lecture on this point.\n\nLastly you are using the word delineate incorrectly. Perhaps the word \"perceive\" or \"ascertain\" would be better chosen here. I would tell you that you can extract civil laws from ancient societies, and I can agree that they would be found in religious text, but association is not causative, and there you've muddled the triumphs of humanity with religion again.  Just because Thou Shalt Not Kill appears in the Bible doesn't mean it gets its authority from the Bible-- it gets its authority from native nontransferrable rights to life. Initially we supposed that the right was nontransferrable because we are already owned by God-- but he has yet to make a court date in his own defense, and his own right is forfeit. But seriously: we aren't living like that anymore, and any jurist worth their salt will be looking down their long nose at attorneys who defend and try cases based on Natural Law.

{"title": "Why $NIO is a good buy", "selftext": "This is my first DD, feel free to go in raw and no rubber, nuts to butts with your criticism\n\n1. Backed by the CCP\n\n“Generally speaking, the Chinese government has been willing to pull several policy levers to support the EV industry. These include incentives such as purchase rebates and tax exemptions. For instance, the government had restrictions around securing a license plate to limit the number of new vehicles on the road to reduce pollution. However, several local governments have been lifting these restrictions on the purchase of new EVs.” - ([https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nio-motors-nyse%3A-nio-has-chinese-government-support%3A-but-do-the-risks-outweigh-the](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nio-motors-nyse%3A-nio-has-chinese-government-support%3A-but-do-the-risks-outweigh-the))\n\nThe CCP has previously given $NIO government subsidies, as well as implementing pro EV and pro $NIO policy changes, showing that they are willing to be active supporters of $NIO both financially and in regards to favorable legislation. If $NIO is in trouble, the CCP will not want them to go under, as they are arguably China's biggest contender against $TSLA in the EV market.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. Reasons for recent price movements\n\nThere are two causes for the recent price movements. $NIO started to decline following the release of its quarterly earnings, despite them not performing particularly poorly. From the Earnings Report:\n\n* Vehicle deliveries were up 42.2% from Q3\n* Vehicle sales were up 44.7% from Q3\n* Total revenue was up 46.7% from Q3\n* Gross margin (How much money the company retains from sales) was up 4.3% from Q3\n\nWhile the earnings report may not have completely met analysts’ expectations for the company, they still show that $NIO continues to grow as a company.\n\nThe second potential cause of $NIO’s decline is that it’s just following the trend of other companies in the EV industry. This argument is much more valid than earnings, at least in my opinion, but I believe that there is still an argument to be had in regards to this. The combined market cap of EV manufacturers is allegedly lower than that of traditional auto manufacturers employing internal combustion engines in their vehicles (Source: [https://www.barrons.com/articles/ev-stocks-crash-tesla-market-value-51614983454](https://www.barrons.com/articles/ev-stocks-crash-tesla-market-value-51614983454))\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. Market Cap compared to competitors\n\n$NIO(55.15B) has a lower market cap than both $TSLA(540.40B) and $GM(79.22B), and there is a significant amount of room for $NIO to grow in the future. The market cap of $TSLA shows us the potential that a successful EV company has if grown correctly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4. Potential for future growth\n\nAlthough $TSLA vehicle sales/deliveries are far better than $NIO’s, if $NIO continues its consistent growth into the future it isn’t unlikely that we will continue to see share prices increase into the future.\n\n$NIO also has plans for expanding into foreign markets. Currently, they have only sold vehicles in China, but CEO William Li has announced plans to expand into international markets soon(European markets the second half of this year, and he plans further expansion in 2022, Source: [https://cnevpost.com/2021/03/01/nio-to-enter-europe-in-h2-this-year/](https://cnevpost.com/2021/03/01/nio-to-enter-europe-in-h2-this-year/)). So far, $NIO has only sold cars in 1 country, but there are 195 countries in the world, so by 2022 we should expect the market cap to be 10.725 Trillion dollars /j\n\n&#x200B;\n\n5. The actual products\n\nIn order to drive an EV, you obviously need a charged battery, because driving with no power is something you can’t do. With Teslas, you need to charge your car for 30 minutes without a supercharger, or one hour without one before being able to drive 44 miles (source:[https://www.tesla.com/support/charging#:\\~:text=How%20fast%20can%20I%20charge,the%20fastest%20possible%20charging%20speed](https://www.tesla.com/support/charging#:~:text=How%20fast%20can%20I%20charge,the%20fastest%20possible%20charging%20speed).), however this is not a problem with Nio cars, because of their Quick Swap battery system. You can just put a new battery into the car and continue driving, which is a huge advantage in terms of practicality. This is a huge advantage in and of itself, and if Nio continues to develop technology to rival Tesla’s, they definitely have the potential to be extremely competitive.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith the recent changes, now is the perfect time to grab $NIO at a discount, as it will likely continue to grow due to the above reasons.\n\n**TL;DR:** $NIO has government backing, a lot of space to grow and expand in terms of markets and market cap, and continues to see consistent growth.\n\n~~11@39.29~~ 13@38.60\n\n**TL;DR for TL;DR**: 📈📈📈📈💰💰🚀🚀🚀", "id": "m0t3vy", "created_utc": 1615245890.0, "score": 89, "upvote_ratio": 0.76, "num_comments": 80, "comments": [{"body": "#11@$39.29\n\n\nAs soon as I bought it at $55+ that shit started to tank", "score": 61, "replies": [{"body": ">Every day I tell myself to sell and every day I lose more money by bag holding\n\nlet me know what you are buying next.", "score": 23, "replies": []}, {"body": "Ha same dumped 5k at 45 figuring it was the bottom... it wasn’t lol", "score": 8, "replies": []}, {"body": "So it is your fault!
