{"title": "There are more retail investors than ever, but we don‚Äôt have the power to tank markets.", "selftext": "I saw a post of a person nervous that the economy is going to tank because of GameStop. This individual‚Äôs mind was so manipulated by the media that she truly thinks retail investors are the reason for GameStop and the possibility of a recession. The post was insulting against the common people, and it was extremely na√Øve. We can help the cause, but as you saw today and yesterday we certainly cannot move it or else we would have. All we do is help bullish institutions by HodLing a stock that we like. \n\nI also see a lot of articles saying that retail investors are essentially the cause of hedge funds losing money and 401(k) stocks just doing their average thing. Meanwhile we‚Äôre making 100%-300% returns because we see past the bullshit and don‚Äôt trust the system. This is infuriating to me and I don‚Äôt think it gets a enough of attention. Gme dropped from 348 to 178 before I could take a snapshot of my gains...yeah we don‚Äôt have that type of power. We have a different power...buy and hold a stock we like. \n\nThere are some really smart apes on WSB here and some really dumb apes. We don‚Äôt have the ability to pum* GME, we just make it A LOT harder for you to dum* it. The reason for that is because we are fearless and re*arded and we like the stock. We have learned not to panic sell (more of us at least).\n\nMy point is figure it the fuck out and stop patronizing over 9 million people by telling the public that we are some godly entity with extreme power. If you‚Äôre out there hedgies please listen: figure out your own problems that your own greed got you into and stop crying on live television. The only difference between retails then and now, is that we see right past your lies and are more aware of how to make money. We just do it legally. \n\nThree years ago no one thought a retail investor could be, not a force in the market, but a CHANGE in the market. What really grinds my bananas, is the fact that it is the billionaire hedge funds job to adjust and pivot to the macro level of market changes. All we do is buy and hold. You‚Äôre telling me that these dumb hedgies can‚Äôt figure out a way to legally work with that? Then they were never qualified to be in that position. \n\nGME made us woke. Now you have to figure out how to make money rather than manipulating the public with articles released 10 minutes before the price action actually happens. We will hold through your fomenting and your petty ass $1 price target downgrades to justify movement in the stock. \n\nThink about it...their argument is don‚Äôt let retail investors trade because it makes our job harder. It‚Äôs harder because they were less informed back then than they are now. We have to stop giving them freedom. It wont work....since we have social media to spread real truth. No way to hide information like they used to. If somehow they do find a work around that it would have to be done illegally and unconstitutionally.
