The reason why no one wanted an electric car for the longest time is that chintziness (edit: and low range). Tesla made people want to buy an electric car, not only for the environment, but also for their own enjoyment and the pride of ownership. I was an owner of a VW (not electric, obviously), and I can't get excited about having another. If I were to be buying Tesla, then yes.\n2. VW's weakest point has always been the software/the electric. THAT was always the glitchiest, most annoying part of their cars.
