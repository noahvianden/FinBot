Mostly the wealthy.  It also avoids capital gains tax.\n\nTake Tesla.  If you borrow 2% every year and pay 3% interest, then as long as Tesla increases on average at 23% / year, you would never have a higher than 10% debt to value ratio (where most have a 300% or more debt to value ratio on real estate).  If Tesla only increased 13% per year, your debt ratio would increase to 20% over time.\n\nTricks:\n1) If you’re 100% Tesla, theoretically the institution can unilaterally change the margin requirement and you may have to sell.  IIRC Fidelity raised their margin requirement from allowing 70% debt to value to only 35% debt to value back in 2018 when the stock was very volatile and had just dropped.  IBKR and Robinhood removed margin altogether on GameStop a while back and called the margin loan due immediately.\n\n2) Even a 20% debt to value ratio should be fine in a huge drop, but it takes nerves of steel to not sell, when that debt to value ratio goes up to 40% or so.  So even if you’re most likely safe, it is stressful!\n\nBottom line: Using margin is a matter of degree.  If you only use a little against a diversified portfolio, there’s very little risk (as long as you don’t panic).  If you use a lot on a single volatile stock (like Tesla used to be), it can be very risky.\n\nDepending on your account, you can negotiate rates as low as 1.25%.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "there isn't a risk equivalency between RE and the equities market", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "You can sell far fewer shares each month to pay the mortgage.

This is how many people missed Tesla's run up last year, because they think it was very high even though when you do the calculation it is not. \n\nCurrently their PS ratio is lower than 20, which is high, but not in today's money printing environment, as everyone else's valuation is higher. If you are using PE ratio, you should not be using it, unless you use a projected profit for Tesla as Tesla has just recenlty passsed their breakeven points, which means their current margins are not their real margin but at the beginning of the curve. At the beginning of the breakeven phase, the profit margin will be low but as it ramps up, a lot of these fixed costs stay fixed while each new sales provide new contributions.\n\nFind me another company that has sales growth over 30% per year that has lower PS ratio than TSLA, not many.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I refer 30% growth it is not auto growth but more valuation growth. I think their auto will grow much much higher than 30% at least in the next 5 years as they are still at the beginning of their ramp up. They are still severely bottle necked and the EV industry has not reached a tipping point yet. Once it has reached a tipping point, i think this is where TSLA will shine even more. When youw ant to buy an EV right now, your decision process will be \"buy tesla or something else?\" and often people choose tesla since their advantage is still very high right now, at least 5 years ahead. This is also coupled that all the competitors evne though that there are many, they are pricing their products way too high for delivering so little compared to Tesla.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn conclusion, similar to January 2020, Tesla was undrevalued despite what everyone said. Today, they are still undervalued. This is similar how AMZN was always undervalued most years in the last 20 years despite everyone crying that they are overvalued every year. most of these people just dont know how to even calculate valuation and often uses the wrong valuation method.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Sure. Maybe Tesla is under valued because of its future potential, maybe it is worth $2 trillion. That doesn't change that it's worth $2 trillion the future.\n\nThere are very real caps to its potential valuation in the next couple decades. It isn't going to be larger than the Energy + Auto + Battery Manufacturing + Taxi-related industries in 2030. It's going to make up a good chunk of them (hopefully), but that gets us to an upper limit of $5 T or so.\n\nWhere is the other $6 T of valuation coming from? Energy is going to be very very competitive and low margin with a lot of long term risk (30+ year project cycles). Claiming most of the top 20% of vehicles (ex. 10 - 20 M per year) is going to be most of the possible revenue in that space. \n\nThe software space is also very competitive, and Tesla will he focussed on their ecosystems with their users.\n\nGoing up the supply chain into mining and refining resources is a very expensive and long term endeavour. If Tesla starts investing in that now, they might not see returns until 2050. There could be value growth here, but not relevant to current investors. Even so, maybe a few hundred billion at most.\n\nOther moonshot industries like boats, VTOL, and the bot are way more than 10 years out, they will also have strong competition there.\n\nLike even if I am extremely generous and say all their other businesses are worth $1 T by 2030, that's still only $6 T upper peak. That is total domination in auto, energy, robotaxis, and battery manufacturing globally, with like $200 B a piece for each moonshot industry they could do (but in smaller and smaller markets)\n\nFor Tesla to be valued at $11 T they would also need:\n\n* 30% market share in global telecommunications\n* 20% market share in the entire global food industry\n* 10% market share in information technology\n\nWell, I'm out of big industries.

Today 11T seems a lot, but in 10 years, 11T is not going to be the same especially with inflation is looking like this year and possibly next few years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso you listed a few things that Tesla needs to be to be 11T but i cant help noticing that your valuation seems to be rooted to almost like the 90s. All of these sectors would not be valuable today except for information technology, and even then the sectors in information technology that is going to be valuable might not even exist in the current sector classification. In the 90s, telecommunications, oil, foods, etc those would make up the most valueable companies, but in today's day and age, look at Apple. They are worth $2T and they make phones and services. If you think the Tesla car as a large iPhone, I think you can see how this translates into valuation. \n\nWhat do they operate in currently? $50-53B for their auto. The unit sales is expected to grow by 50%, but this might translate into 30%, which means that the value should double every 2.5 years just from this sector alone. The current valuation of Tesla does not take into consideration much its battery business, solar, autonomous driving as they are still quite early.
