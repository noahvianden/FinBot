{"title": "SPY and Gamma Squeezes", "selftext": " Hey guy\n\nI   come to you to discuss a rather interesting development in the  markets!  In short: SPY is in a gamma squeeze, and not a good one like  last time.\n\nThis  post will be  relatively lengthy, as I am going to try to lay out my  system as well  as the interpretation of it. But there will be a lot of  pictures. I  don't usually [post](https://www.reddit.com/user/HiddenGooru/posts/?sort=top)   about SPY, but rather other stocks that are in Reddit's sphere of   interest at the time. But the changes on SPY are worth mentioning to you   guys.\n\nLet's start with what I  do:  I look at price directing forces on a stock and quantify them.  Certain  stocks and certain characteristics, so each time I do this its   particular to the given stock. I developed a metric to do this called   VoEx - its aim is to show when a stock is over exposed to certain   price-directing agents that can cause characteristic, deterministic, and   predictable consequences.\n\nSo, let's look at VoEx for SPY:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ SPY for 2021-09-20. VoEx-daily is Magenta, VoEx-trend is tan, blue is   SPY's price. The horizontal lines are the inhibition line \\(top\\), and the   propagation line \\(bottom\\).  ](https://preview.redd.it/ms8n30zcuyo71.png?width=1051&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a15dc639face767a057e161b9aed24893554858)\n\nThis is VoEx. The magenta line is   VoEx-daily, the tan line in VoEx-tan, and the blue line is the price of   SPY. There are two horizontal lines as well, these are the inhibition   line (top), and propagation line (bottom).  The idea is that when VoEx   is between these two lines: all is well. But when VoEx is outside of   these lines, all is not well.\n\nYou'll notice several things:\n\n1. When   VoEx-daily (magenta) experiences a significant spike into the   inhibition zone (above inhibition line), the price falls; where:  \n\n   1. There is a loose association with the strength and duration of the spike and the subsequent price-reversion\n2. It is not uncommon for VoEx-daily to dip into the propagation zone (bottom horizontal bar),\n3. It is *very* uncommon for VoEx-trend to dip into the propagation zone.\n\nIn fact, the only other time on this graph that VoEx-trend dipped into the propagation zone was *February 2020.*\n\nThere are those who suggest the market crash in 2020 was purely because of Covid. To that I have this to show:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ VoEx for SPY from 2018-2020  ](https://preview.redd.it/2gxcixreuyo71.png?width=3836&format=png&auto=webp&s=d5a57f0bb0fe18dc869d8a4d831adbc2c80010a7)\n\n \n\nYou'll, again, notice that VoEx-trend dipping into the propagation zone is **never** a good thing.\n\nTo demonstrate how significant this is, here are some other VoEx graphs:\n\nHere's BABA:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ VoEx for BABA on 2021-09-20  ](https://preview.redd.it/5vlib18guyo71.png?width=1076&format=png&auto=webp&s=f590a524d5626be88d112fd4db745a970fca7181)\n\n \n\nYou'll notice that VoEx-trend slipped into the propagation zone around Feb of 2020 - and BABA hasn't done well since.\n\nSame with EDU:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ VoEx for EDU on 2021-09-20  ](https://preview.redd.it/hazhqjqhuyo71.png?width=1092&format=png&auto=webp&s=4aaf660da4e6a8a67825f45336769931e2ee57b2)\n\n Here's TSLA: \n\n  \n\n\n[ VoEx for TSLA on 2021-09-20  ](https://preview.redd.it/wuoqpj6juyo71.png?width=1086&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d2cef4520a5304dc7a328aae7097d2fb9e0008c)\n\n \n\nNaturally, these, however, are single stocks - not an entire Market-wide ETF.\n\nTo add to matters, SPY is currently in a gamma squeeze to the tune of almost **12 million shares per point**.\n\nOne   of the things I do is directionalize options; I can place them as   dealer long or dealer short. So getting a grasp of   delta is pretty handy at times. Want to see how this affects SPY's price?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ Hedging matrix for SPY 2021-09-20. The hedging matrix shows the amount   of shares that have to be purchased \\(+\\) or sold \\(-\\) per point move in   price and IV.   ](https://preview.redd.it/it8hb0qluyo71.png?width=337&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac23dbb883a19820f28472c6d3e22f52d417cc3b)\n\n \n\nThis shows that for every point decrease and IV increase in SPY, **12 million** shares must be sold. Yesterday alone saw a **7 point** price depreciation and a **5 point** increase in IV that equated to: **137,493,216** shares that had to be sold. Yesterday's gamma squeeze on SPY was less than it was today.\n\nSo in short - historically VoEx-trend dipping into the propagation line has been met with market corrections/crashes.\n\nHappy trading!", "id": "psy0qu", "created_utc": 1632277874.0, "score": 72, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 77, "comments": [{"body": "After a long time, I read good post in wsb.

So I don't know how that interaction would work.\n\nEdit: I just realized OP might be talking about the S&P500 as a whole. I swear to God if he thinks the entire S&P500 can be gamma-squeezed...

Without multiple statistically-similar datapoints, we can't assess predictability nor can we assess the impact of a particular change. I'm not sure that a cross-section of normal stocks represents the price action of a massive ETF.\n\nThe second quibble is about the delta hedge point. This presumes that delta neutrality is always perfectly aligned and it almost certainly isn't on a day-by-day basis. I'm not sure I trust the data on SPY shares outstanding on the Internet, but if it's right then SPY's shares outstanding is like 900+M... and the average volume is 64M. Looks like volume on 9/20 was 166M. So is it possible that you're onto something and it's reflected in the numbers? Maybe, but these numbers to me suggest that it's probably a muted trend compared to the potential.\n\nStill, a very interesting analysis and I'd like to learn more about VoEx. These quibbles are not meant to shed any significant doubt on the potential predictiveness of the model.", "score": 15, "replies": [{"body": "Most curious quibbles indeed.", "score": 12, "replies": []}, {"body": "Seems this DD aged well!", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah, I'd say so... do you have any fresh analysis?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "It aint good, ha.

To that I have this to show:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou haven't disproven that the crash was due to COVID here. There's a common misconception that COVID didn't cause an economic issue in the United States until the first controls were put into place, but that belief is false and what your data is picking up on is that that perception is false.\n\nCOVID didn't emerge in the American psyche in March... it didn't even emerge in February. I maintain macroeconomic risk AI for a major credit company and we started picking up on economic softness signals related to COVID in January.\n\nWhat you're seeing is a market artifact reflecting the filtering of economic data and fear from COVID seeping into the market ahead of time. Now that may mean that the metric is potentially predictive, but the perception that this technical suggests that the cause of the crash wasn't COVID is inaccurate, because COVID was absolutely, 100% affecting the market in January, and it was definitely affecting it in February of 2020.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "I am a bot from /r/wallstreetbets.
