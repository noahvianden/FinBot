{"title": "Expected moves SPY, PFE, MRNA, LULU, GME.", "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\n**Broader Market ETFs**\n\n**Last Week** – SPY was higher by 5%, less than the 0.8% expected move options were pricing.\n\n**This Week** – SPY options are pricing a 0.8% move (in either direction) for the upcoming (4 day) week. With the SPY around $453 that corresponds to about $449 as a bearish expected move and $456 as a bullish expected move.\n\n**Implied Volatility** – The VIX was unchanged on the week and ended Friday at about 16.50. That is lower than its historical average. December VIX futures are about 22, down slightly from last week.\n\n**Expected Moves for This Week (via Options AI)**:\n\nThe major ETFs are all pricing similar moves this week than they did last week:\n\n* SPY **0.8%**\n* QQQ **1.0%**\n* IWM **1.5%**\n* DIA **0.8%**\n\nThe 0.8% expected move in the SPY is lower than the historical average. An Iron Condor with short strikes set at the expected move (based on the close Friday), needs the ETF to finish between $450 and $456 to see Max Gain. Here’s an example on the expected move chart, showing the risk/reward and breakeven of a $1 wide condor at the Expected Move. It's tight, but that's what a 16 VIX looks like vs Condors and other OTM credit spreads.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ndyzy8gyqyl71.png?width=570&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d52d0886c4de42795af5bc3ac92371f6d118ffa\n\n**In the News**\n\nCovid booster shots are now a topic of conversation and Pfizer (PFE) may be available for a roll-out by the end of September with their FDA review scheduled for the 17th. Moderna (MRNA) will likely lag Pfizer and officials are recommending those that had the Moderna shots to wait for a Moderna booster. There is no timeline yet for review of a Johnson & Johnson booster. Here's how options are pricing expected moves for those three stocks out to October 1st:\n\n* PFE 4.5%\n* MRNA 12%\n* JNJ 2.5%\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Expected Moves for Companies Reporting Earnings**\n\nSome earnings of note this week with expected moves, and recent actual earnings moves.
