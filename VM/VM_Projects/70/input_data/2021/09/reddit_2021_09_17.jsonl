To put this in perspective, Shopify did 2.9 billion in revenue with a 180 billion market cap. On top of that, Wish has 1.6 Billion in cash and no debt. I believe Wish is way oversold and undervalued.\n\n  \nAfter processing new information (Q2 results and management outlook for upcoming quarters), Wish's fair value is $14.77 per share. At $6, Wish is massively undervalued, and current prices are likely driven by a market overreaction to the Q2 earnings report and bearish all around short term market sentiment.
