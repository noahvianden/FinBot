The closest thing like that to happen to me was when I first started getting into Options trading without a full understanding.  I don't recall how many contracts I bought, but bought a bunch of NVDA calls.  I let them expire thinking they were worthless because my portfolio showed I had a small loss because of the premium I paid.  But in fact, they were slightly above the strike price of the options.  The next week, I found a ton of shares of NVDA in my portfolio (don't recall exactly the amount, but it was at the time a significant percentage of my portfolio, I think over $1M worth).  I freaked out.  Good thing is my portfolio at the time was big enough so I didn't get a margin call, and even more so, the stock price went up.  I sold it that same day I think and made a small profit.  Learned that lesson!", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Holy crap that's a great and scary story!
