In this thread: the sentiment keeping the stock afloat.  \n\nYou will constantly be told how amazing the company is, and they are pushing the rest of the car industry to go into EV, which I agree, is great, but nobody can really explain why the price is $850, and not $600. At $600, that would still make it the most valuable car company in the world, while delivering 1/5 of the cars. \n\n I really like what the company is doing, but it's a very expensive stock. \n\nI've worked as an engineer in automotive, and I can tell you scaling is hard. People think the more cars you make, the cheaper everything gets (economies of scale) but it also gives your suppliers more leverage to negotiate prices each year. \n\nTesla is looked at both as a growth company that can grow 50% year over year for 10 years (going from 500k to 1M cars is easier than 1M to 2M) and simultaneously as this behemoth that will make 20 million cars while under-cutting on price, while some how maintaining great margins (I know, they want to sell the car for $30k, and self driving for $10k subscription). \n\nScaling is somehow considered to be easy because of their giga factories and \"they are a tech company\", but Elon musk was on TV asking for nickel for batteries. Meanwhile, every car company is rushing into EV. I guess tesla margins are immune to supply chain constraints and competition. This is where those supplier negotiations squeeze margins. \n\nOn top of all this, they haven't run into their first major recall yet.  It will happen, and without a dealer network, and long lead times on repairs now, it's anybody's guess on how they will go about doing it. \n\nThey also haven't faced a unionized work force or labor strike. \n\nPeople are also acting like the first self driving car company will be the only one, but given the rapid pace of deep learning and churn of expertise out of the company (other companies poaching tsla engineers), it's not reasonable to assume that moat is durable.  Maybe a few years advantage, at most. Many point to road data as a big moat, but training models with less data is a very active field of research. Saying that others won't figure this out is betting against the best math minds in the world, and Nvidia, amazon and Google.  \n\nThey are also acting like tesla demand is infinitely large. They haven't had to deal with inventory yet, but I promise they will eventually miss sales goals and will have unsold vehicles. When that will happen is difficult to say. \n\nTsla bulls brush all this off as \"it just won't happen, tesla will win. Just drive one, and you'll know it's different\".
