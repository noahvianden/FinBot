{"title": "Ultimate Guide to Selling Options Profitably PART 10 - Selling High IV Rank (In depth study)", "selftext": "# A common metric used by option sellers is IV Rank. In this post we will answer the question: Should we sell high IV Rank?\n\n# Most retail options traders understand the concept of \"buy cheap things, sell expensive things\", as a core principle for trading successfully.\n\nAs you become more advanced, you learn about VRP. It's at this point, since we are interested in selling options, we typically start looking for expensive options to sell.\n\nThe challenge we face is *identifying expensive options*. Once we can find something trading for $10, that is really worth $5, it's an easy game. The hard part is knowing what something is really worth.\n\nThe most common way that retail traders try to find expensive options is by using IV Rank. IV rank tells us what today's implied volatility is for a stock relative to the highest and lowest we have seen it over the past 1-year. If we see an IV Rank of 100%, this means the IV is at its highest level over the past 1-year.\n\n# Most retail traders would interpret a high IV Rank as a sell signal, and it would make sense why they would.\n\nIf we look at VIX for example, we can see that it is mean reverting. When it goes high, it usually comes back down. When it goes low, it usually comes back up!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[VIX Price Chart. When it goes high, it comes down. When it goes low, it comes up.](https://preview.redd.it/zwwzvbi7guu71.png?width=1872&format=png&auto=webp&s=093fc1ee59a49e60f05b67e0fbdeeab1837fd441)\n\nBut the question we need as ourselves is:\n\n\"*Do we increase our returns by selling specifically when IV is high?\"*\n\nBefore we can evaluate if it is profitable sell high IV rank, we need to determine what constitutes profitability. For example, if selling when IV is high makes money, but does worse than just selling options all the time, then it is not good. By adding a filter to our strategy, we are trying to improve our strategy, not make things more complicated just for the sake of it.\n\nSo, the first thing we are going to do is create a benchmark for us to compare selling High IV to.\n\nHere is a backtest where we just sell implied volatility every single month since 2007. In this backtest we are selling the 30 day straddle, and then rebalancing every 20 days.\n\nThis is what we get.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ih6lui78guu71.png?width=1594&format=png&auto=webp&s=68b7895cabd9afd278cea61d7ac513f729500a1e\n\nAs you can see, it does OK. It's a 5.5% annualized return, which is fine especially considering our max drawdowns. What this means is that we could leverage up a bit here and do reasonably well.\n\nThis is our benchmark.\n\n# Now let's see how we do if we sell high implied volatility.\n\nWhat we are going to be doing is selling that same straddle in high implied volatility environments (IVR>60%). If implied volatility is high relative to where it has been in the past, we are going to sell a straddle.\n\nHere's what we get:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Wow... not quite what we expected!!](https://preview.redd.it/kman8tu8guu71.png?width=1690&format=png&auto=webp&s=1b1455f867073f609949eee012e6e207bc5721dc)\n\nWe had an OK period in 2009 after the crisis when insurance was expensive and realized volatility started to come down.\n\nBut in general, it doesn't do well, and we actually got demolished in 2020s down move.\n\n# This is weird, right?\n\nIf implied volatility is mean reverting, why are we losing? Shouldn't selling implied volatility when it is high make sense? Since in the future it will come back down and we can buy it back?\n\nUnfortunately, the answer is no.\n\n# What we actually see is that selling implied volatility in low vol environments actually does extremely well.\n\nTo show this, let's take a look at SVXY during the lowest implied volatility period ever, back in 2017.\n\nFor those of you who don't know, SVXY is the short volatility index. it sells volatility on the front month future of the VIX.\n\nTake a look:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/idkfr5n9guu71.png?width=1866&format=png&auto=webp&s=90d6d6c76bacd1bad8fe2d7c2455dae7103977ce\n\nWhat we see is that SVXY does fantastic during 2017. It had its best year ever during the lowest volatility year. This is so counter intuitive!\n\nThis is crazy because selling high implied volatility makes sense theoretically because it comes back down. And selling low implied volatility shouldn't make money because it will just come back up.\n\n# So what is actually happening?\n\nThe reason this happens is because:\n\n***Realized volatility outpaces implied volatility when implied volatility is high, and realized volatility is much lower than implied volatility when implied volatility is low.***\n\nAnd just to recap, implied volatility is the market's forecast of realized volatility. Realized volatility is  how much volatility actually happens.\n\n**Here's an example:**\n\nLet's say AAPL moves up 10% today. That's a realized move. It actually happened. If the market had implied a 5% move, we would say realized volatility *outpaced* implied volatility, and selling options wouldn't have made money.\n\n*So let's think about this.*\n\nWhen volatility is really high. We see realized volatility outperform implied volatility. This basically means that the market doesn't account for how much volatility is actually going to happen.\n\nAnd when volatility is low, the market over estimates realized volatility.\n\nAnd there's a reason for this! If you think about it, *volatility clusters*. Which means that if today's volatility is low, tomorrows volatility is most likely to be low too.\n\nIn good times, people still buy insurance. They buy those protective options. Even though they aren't needing to \"use the insurance\", the insurance providers still charge a premium to compensate for when they inevitably will need to use it. This buying pressure keeps and premium implied volatility at a certain level above realized volatility.\n\n# Basically, because things are calm it's a lot cleaner to collect our risk premium.\n\nBut once the realized volatility shoots up, everyone is already protected.\n\n**They already have their premiums to protect themselves from the future moves.**\n\nNot only that, but it becomes a lot more difficult to price volatility when things are going crazy!\n\n# So even though we get these massive moves, the implied volatility doesn't actually outpace the realized volatility, as it did in the low volatility environments.\n\nThis means that selling high implied volatility can actually be really bad, while selling volatility in lower vol environments can actually be very lucrative, ***because people are always going to overestimate tomorrows volatility when volatility is really low***.\n\n# To make this clear, let's look at the implied volatility VS realized volatility over the last 10 years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The red line is the realized volatility, and the black line is what the market was implying. ](https://preview.redd.it/8rrxkf2cguu71.png?width=1548&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb747f3cbdbb0d7d48d00072acb3e262b2764a6d)\n\nWhat you can see is the lines try to follow each other. This is because there is a correlation between implied and realized volatility.\n\nWhen the lines are  on the low end of the chart, the implied vol line is higher than the realized vol line.\n\nAnd on the high side, realized volatility is outpacing implied!\n\n*So this is a big misconception that a lot of traders in the the retail space have.*\n\nWe typically love selling high implied volatility, when in actual fact it's not the best time to be selling volatility.\n\n# Bonus: Knowing this, here is a strategy that does reasonably well trading SPY Stocks.\n\nI am sharing this one in particular because it's pretty cool.\n\nWhat we are going to do is buy SPY Stock when volatility is low. We are going to close out our position when SPY volatility is high.\n\nThe metric we are using for high/low implied volatility  is the VIX Futures curve. If the first month is higher than the second month, This is my high implied volatility signal. When the front month goes below the second month, we are buying SPY.\n\nThis graph shows a backtest of the strategy. Here's how it performed!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m8926nwcguu71.png?width=2836&format=png&auto=webp&s=84eed1095f1e2e4a3d6f044bf41c856b1e4bfe92\n\nThere were 174 trades in the backtest, and following this strategy actually eliminated being in the financial crisis and COVID19 environment. It has a sharpe of 2.7!\n\nThis does pretty well, and you can actually start doing this today if you want.\n\n# Here is an example to help illustrate the main point of this post.\n\nImagine we are looking at a stock. Let's call it $XYZ.\n\nYesterday, $XYZ was trading at $10. Today, it gapped up like crazy and now it is trading at $100. Is it now expensive?\n\nLet's say tomorrow it gaps up another 100%, to $200. Is it now expensive?\n\nWell, it might be. But what if I told you the stock was actually worth $1,000. Now it's actually a huge discount, even though it had a huge move up!!\n\n**In the same way, IV Rank doesn't really tell us about the value of the option.**\n\nBack in march 2020, people were selling vol at VIX 30 because it had an IV rank of 100. and then at 40. 50, 60, 70, 80 VIX... people lost a lot of money.\n\nWhat I do find IV rank useful for is building a watchlist of stocks that are moving. It makes a good filter for narrowing down the whole market into a more manageable list. *But it's not the sell signal.*\n\n# Always remember:\n\n# Just because something is high, doesn't mean it is expensive. Just because something is low, doesn't mean it is cheap.\n\n# We can only determine if something is cheap or expensive once we have an opinion on it's fair value!\n\nI hope you found this post helpful, let me know if you have any questions and see you in the next part of this series.\n\n**NOTE:** If you want to see the other parts of this series, They are linked on my profile. \n\nHappy trading,\n\n\\~ AG", "id": "qcxsmb", "created_utc": 1634839841.0, "score": 353, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 78, "comments": [{"body": "Thanks for these posts!

Option price data is not cheap.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLong Answer:\n\nAs with everything on the internet, you don't trust it until proven trustable.  Even then, you never blindly accept what they say.\n\nI've got enough of a finance, math and programming background to work things out. It may take me more time, but I know I can do it. And in this case, I was wanting to start using option selling as a way to make money, not lose it.\n\nSo the main issue here is that options data is not cheap. It's not free, and any service that offers up free data, gives you just enough to not to be able to do anything useful with it. At least not what I wanted to do. Or they only give you answers which are not at all helpful in validating something like the Tasty claims.\n\nI did this exercise a few years ago. Still this data is not free anywhere. A quick look, it can cost anywhere from 900 to 9000 depending on the level of detail that you want. Just for SPX nothing else.\n\nThe test I did was just the simple sell a put at 30 delta at about 45 days out. run it through a montecarlo based on random dates and calculate data on holding to 21 days and holding to term. Record the win / Loss and the amount.\n\nSince I don't have option pricing data, I need a way to calculate an approximate price of the option at the end of each day. Volatility is a core component of an option price.  As you dig into black shoals within D1 and D2 you have volatility. So yes you absolutely need volatility to calculate the price of an option. Great link on calculating vix, but the main component for that calculation is futures options pricing which I don't have. Which is why I use vix to help approximate what a SPY option contract would be.\n\nVix was not my first choice. I tried using the past 10 day, 15 days, etc to get an approximation, but it was not good enough it always underestimated the value of the option. Same if I looked forward in time and calculate forward actual volatility. Most of the time forward is to low too. I was learning at this point. Vix which is forward expected volatility gave a better pricing approximation of the option value. I'd say I was plus/minus .05 on the price. My goal was to get reasonably  close. 5 cents is under most bid ask spreads on anything but the most liquid of underlying. If you've been following tasty, or doing serious options selling the reason is already clear and one of the edges of option selling.\n\nMost cases, future volatility expectations are almost always over estimated vs realized volatility. When you sell options your not only selling time, you are selling volatility. With the expectation that realized volatility will be lower than expected. The 30 delta, the realizing lower volatility than expected and managing early are the edges in the Tasty Method.\n\nIn the end I came out within 1-2 percentage points on the winning rates Tasty showed. The dollars were positive for the 30 delta held to term, then managing at 21 was even higher. Higher win rate and fewer days overcame managing early for less credit collected. I adjusted for average days in trade for the two for capital efficiency and to get comparable yearly rates of return.\n\nThis is not a level of autism. It is a healthy level of skeptism.

Never said anything about applying it to a specific underlying. So stop trying into introduce false tangents to prove your non existent point.\n\nIV for SPX and IV for SPY will be very close. Close enough to use to prove out the  study. I was trying to see if the selling the put at 30 delta did indeed work. And then managing at the 21 DTE. Both proved out. The point being that yes, in general you get a positive return selling 30 delta puts at 45 and managing at 21 DTE.\n\n I know the option pricing margin of error I'm dealing with. Will that margin of error turn into something significant? Not really, just more like a friction coefficient akin to fees and bid ask spreads. Which the studies always leave out, but can also be the difference between making money and losing money. I'm not looking for something that is perfect. just something close enough for the POC.\n\nDiving into local curve space it all depends upon the local topography of the curve. When 95% of the time you are in a normal distribution world. The differences in the local topography in black shoals vs the current option pricing models are close enough for the average retail trader. The price differences will be consistently different. so like for like in decay etc are close enough.

I'm currently not aware of a strategy that works 100% of the time. Maybe you know of one and can share with everyone. \n\nSO, going back to the intent of the article. IV and IVR. The intent is to show that selling premium in high IV and IVR does not always work as expected. And in a lot of cases will cause losses if your unaware of it's impact. The major reason is that when you get in to 4+ STD moves the models themselves do not price accurately at all. The prudent retail trader should just walk away from high IV.

The 2 STD Normal probability curve is not an accurate model when volatility starts to dominate the option price. To much risk for the premium being sold.\n\nRight now I'm not using IVR at all.
