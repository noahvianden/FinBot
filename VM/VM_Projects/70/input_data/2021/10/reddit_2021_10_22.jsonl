{"title": "Are there any *actualy consistent*, low-risk low-return income generating strategies that work?", "selftext": "TL;DR Edit for anyone who happens to have the same goal or question as me: Options are not a suitable avenue for this kind of investing. While I love the energy around WSB and being a 'trader', the relative risk on an individual trade for many of the common 'income' strategies coupled with deficiencies and variance in the actual income generated and current market factors all conspire to make regular consistent income too ephemeral. I hope to have escaped the options jungle with my limbs in tact (albiet with a few bumps bruises and lessons), best of luck in all future trades to everyone who still has machetes in hand!\n\n\\---\n\nAs someone with a decent paying job (100k+) and a moderate inheritance queued up I have little to no interest in anything that could be described as long term investing. I have other mechanisms by which my financial future is (at present) assured, so I set out with a different investing goal: moderate income generation.\n\nA quick Google indicates that avg side hustle income is around $500-700 a month, and frankly the idea of being able to make the same money that someone who drives for UberEats makes from the comfort of my own investing account is incredibly appealing.\n\nSo I started out investing with my eye on building a portfolio of relatively cheap high-dividend stocks that I could comfortably establish large positions in to capitalize on the div yield. The more research I did the more I saw div stocks are basically a scam for anyone who isn't institutional or has institutional money, so I looked to options. Then I found the Wheel, which seemed like a great strategy to do exactly what I was looking for: minimize losses and emphasize small but consistent \\*income\\* by acting like an independant broker, effectively capitalizing on the trades others want to make and collecting my pound of flesh. However, in the first 3 underlyings I attempted to wheel (PLTR, PFE, and SNAP) I've effectively been beat to hell and unable to find a good groove.\n\nSo my question is the title, is my goal simply incompatible with how options trading functions, have I simply picked bad underlyings, or is there another strategy that is more focused on regular income generation even if the month to month returns are in the relatively low figures I put above. For ref the amount I'm willing to put into my portfolio atm is \\~$25k but if a larger chip stack would make certain strategies more feasible I'm definitely open to it. Thanks in advance for any discussion!\n\nEdit: I forgot to add that I'm also not opposed to strategies that require even daily maintenance.

If you are willing to put that entire $25k into one basket each week, I would suggest selling iron condors on an index, like $SPX.  SPX uses European style options, meaning there is no early assignment risk and it is cash settled, so no shares.  They have expiry 3x a week as well, so you could run this strategy 3x per week to be a bit riskier and make a bit more but have to deal with tighter wings.\n\nIf you follow the typical iron condor strategy I have heard of 1 Standard deviation shorts then you are looking at approximately 0.15 delta short calls and puts and then buy your protection leg at the immediate preceding strike.  Just an example for this week (Oct 29 expiry), you are selling a $4475 put, buying a $4470 put, selling a $4595 call and buying a $4600 call.  Assuming you get filled exactly at the mid price means you will see approximately $130 in returns while risking $370 in max loss.  This is much better than seeing $40 in returns and risking $4000 Wheeling something like PFE (even though PFE is safe).\n\nIs this a perfect strategy? No, it does require some maintenance to make sure it isn't blowing through your strike.  This would cost you about $20,000 - $25,000 in maintenance each week but would get you to your goal of approx. $500 a month in income from your living room.  With an iron condor, you are betting on the price staying within the two short wings.  This is typically a much easier bet on an index that isn't going to see huge parabolic moves up or down one day to the next.  \n\nAnother option is the iron butterfly, where you will actually see a good risk to reward (usually 3-4x) if you plan your strikes well.  Just be aware that you very rarely, if ever, going to see your max gain on these.  The goal is for price to stay within your breakevens.  However, if price does see a large move up or down, you are risking far more than the iron condor and could see upwards of a $2000 loss.  With the butterflies you can play them as a dead-neutral strategy where you aim to sell the calls and puts ATM, or you can play them a bit more directional where you are limiting your loss exponentially while still keeping those huge risk to reward returns, but your chance of profitability (expiring within the strikes) drops considerably.  \n\nNone of these are easy money like you think but they are easier money than trying to pick a stock that isn't going to fall apart or is going to continue trending higher over the coming weeks/months.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}
