{"title": "(Update) Palantir Technologies (PLTR) Price Action 10 Oct 21 üöÄ üöÄ", "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/e5ofq7ypcjs71.png?width=1819&format=png&auto=webp&s=11e0d46dd6590ee290dcf6c7c8a393a601690c43\n\n**TLDR**\n\nPLTR needs to stay above $23/ white dotted trendline for possibility of uptrend or else it may retest $20 or $17.19.\n\n**Long read**\n\nSince [17 Sep 2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ppx61x/update_palantir_technologies_pltr_price_action/) post, PLTR briefly retested $29 resistance but failed to make further gains. Subsequently it created a double top\\* and prices fell. Current price action is testing its longer term uptrend support, if we further extend the lower trend line from its 30 Sep 2020 DPO (white dotted line).\n\nHence its a sellers market if there are daily candles/crayons below this line. That could open the possibility of a retest of $20 support or $17.19 support.\n\nIts good news for us bulls if prices can sustain above the white dotted trendline. That could give us a potential retest of $27 and $29 resistance. A break above the latter may trigger crazy rallies, but lets focus on the nearest resistance.\n\n**Disclaimer**\n\n1. Not financial advise; do your own research.\n2. Holding longs at avg $17.19. Other positions: SQ longs avg $229.22; TSLA longs avg $665.18; UPRO longs avg $116.34; and SDC longs avg $6.70; may open S&P500 futures short as hedge\n\nSkynet /PLTR üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ", "id": "q4zj72", "created_utc": 1633833670.0, "score": 112, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 74, "comments": [{"body": "I would love PLTR at $17 again or even better $10 again.
