{"title": "$AAWW SHIIIIIT DD Part 3: Atlas Air Saves Christmas", "selftext": "About a month ago I [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pottj2/dd_atlas_air_aaww_is_laughably_undervalued_and/) about how $AAWW is an incredibly undervalued stock with several upcoming catalysts for a revaluation.\n\nA brief recap:\n\n>AAWW is critically undervalued. COVID has all but annihilated international air travel volumes, driving up the price of air freight. Short term shipping disruptions have caused prices to soar, spilling over in to the air freight market. Analysts are expecting this disruption to resolve quickly, but are missing the shifts that airlines are making to narrow body jets and the impact on air freight. AAWW will have high earnings for years, and its current P/E of 4 is a joke. 13.6% of the float is shorted, and Atlas Air is free to reinitiate buybacks at the end of this month. AAWW's market cap could double and it still would trade at the rock bottom P/E of 8. Bullish AF.\n\n\\--------------------\n\n**SHORT TERM UPDATES**\n\nSince then, we've seen more and more fantastic news for AAWW come out. You may have seen on the news how fucked up the ports are... with dozens of ships waiting in line, a lack of port employees to unload them, and a lack of containers making their way back to Asia, there's absolute chaos in the ocean freight market. Prices for trips from Asia to the US have skyrocketed. Early last week, we saw those rates crash as (a) speculators who were flipping shipping slots for profits rushed to sell before they actually had to use the slots, and (b) the delays now meant that the goods would not be here in time for Black Friday or Christmas. So what happened to air freight rates? Spoiler: [They flew higher.](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/superhot-airfreight-market-leaves-shippers-in-the-cold) (If you only read one article from this post, this is a good one, and it is from today!)\n\nTake the following excerpt from [this article](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/bare-shelves-retail-plans-holiday-supply-chain-delays/607677/) on the dire supply chain situation retail is facing and how they are mitigating it:\n\n>Others have spent what would in past years have been unthinkable amounts of money to fly product in by air freight, usually a transportation mode of last resort for many companies. [Executives](https://www.retaildive.com/news/what-retail-executives-are-saying-about-widespread-supply-chain-bottlenecks/605431/) at Nordstrom, Gap Inc., Tapestry and others have all told analysts they were taking on air freight costs to bypass bottlenecks in ocean freight.\n\nEven Levi's, who sells the most non-perishable, who-the-fuck-cares-when-you-get-it, item imaginable is [using airfreight this quarter](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/Levis-diverts-airfreight-port-congestion-Long-Beach/603147/).\n\nAnd it's not just them. Atlas Air announced an agreement with HP earlier this year - this is not a traditional company who would typically source a dedicated freighter. They did it because they can use that aircraft to minimize supply chain disruptions. On the earnings call, CEO  John Dietrich discussed that they're \"creating a new customer base ... with the likes of HP and others, where they typically had not committed to dedicated freighters.\" I bet we'll have lots of good news on the next earnings call given the situation right now.\n\nIn fact, check out this article fresh from today: [**Air cargo rates skyrocket again as forwarders scramble for capacity**](https://theloadstar.com/air-cargo-rates-skyrocket-again-as-forwarders-scramble-for-capacity/)\n\n>‚ÄúWe are already seeing charter prices rise to record levels,‚Äù he explained. ‚ÄúAs more aircraft are booked up, we are having to find aircraft from increasingly large distances to service key routes. This is a particular problem in Asia at the moment, with transpacific prices hitting $2m for a charter on a Boeing 777 for the first time, compared with around $750,000, at its best, pre-pandemic levels.‚Äù  \n>  \n>Mr Morgan-Evans said ACS had received calls from retailers that ‚Äúnormally wouldn‚Äôt dream of chartering‚Äù, since there‚Äôs no ad-hoc scheduled capacity left in the market.\n\nü§§**ü§ë**ü§§**ü§ë**ü§§**ü§ë**ü§§**ü§ë**ü§§**ü§ë**ü§§**ü§ë**ü§§**ü§ë**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**LONG TERM PROSPECTS**\n\nNow, I know what you are thinking. This is a short term disruption, and after that, Atlas Air is going to plummet from its current shitty valuation back to its pre-pandemic super shit valuation. Decent theory... its the one that those who are shorting 14% of the float believe. But it's flat out wrong.\n\nIATA (gold standard for all things air) [recently published](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/iata-forecasts-2021-air-cargo-revenues-to-hit-record-175b) their full year 2021 and forward 2022 projections for air cargo. They see... YOY ***GROWTH*** in 2022 amounting to \\~5% greater cargo next year than in 2021. This does not fit the narrative that AAWW is on its last hoorah.\n\n[Note the +5&#37; YOY growth projected for air cargo in 2022.](https://preview.redd.it/bk5y0nmkhat71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e7f92f8385509c61bb578b21998b583f14cf2f4)\n\nAtlas air is not the only one noticing this... we've seen [so](https://theloadstar.com/air-canada-grows-transit-flows-as-it-prepares-for-arrival-of-freighter-conversions/) [many](https://www.aircargonews.net/airlines/freighter-operator/21-air-looks-to-expand-its-fleet-for-peak-demand/) [airlines](https://www.aircargonews.net/airlines/amazon-air-continues-to-expand-us-freighter-network/) attempting to buy cargo planes or convert passenger aircraft. Yet there are multi-year waitlists for conversion programs and new planes. So clearly those in the industry expect this to last a while. Check out [this article](https://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/news/2021/09/14/demand-high-for-freight-planes-and-conversions.html) which summarizes it quite well.\n\nWhy will it last a while? Well, online shopping and 2-day shipping relies heavily on airfreight. I'll point out that Atlas Air has strategically focused on becoming a critical part of the e-commerce supply chain. I have my doubts that people will stop buying stupid shit online.\n\nIn short, this is not simply a short term ordeal. AAWW is a value-add desperately needed by all industries at the moment, and inflation is helping them get their fair share of the pie going forward.\n\nI cannot wait for the Q3 earnings release and call.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**POSITIONS**\n\nI bought the dip, again.\n\n[YOLO](https://preview.redd.it/4kwnudy0iat71.png?width=1812&format=png&auto=webp&s=f198b529378bc9ca17afdca664a4287aa7524107)", "id": "q7looo", "created_utc": 1634162335.0, "score": 88, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 79, "comments": [{"body": "I actually just bought some more today, and more earlier after the dip.\n\nYou mention lots of cargo planes coming into the skies; won't that additional capacity unfavorably effect prices?", "score": 10, "replies": []}, {"body": "I‚Äôm also in similar size as you.
