I was just thinking about this.  I closed my puts yesterday, but here's my thoughts on OPEN.  \n\nOPEN is in a similar position to Zillow in that they're losing money big time.  I think they're not as honest about what they're facing because they are a one trick pony - unlike Zillow they can't admit iBuying isn't working since it's all they do.  After Zillow announced the pause on iBuying a few weeks ago, OPEN said \"we're open for business\" or similar.\n\nThis is a complete guess, but I think they'll dress up their earnings announcement by saying look at all these homes we bought and how we put Zillow out of business.  They're praying for the price drops to stop in housing, but they're in worse shape than Zillow was.\n\nCheck out Opendoor's website.  Their properties are uncompetitively priced, but OPEN is very resistant to price drops.\n\nOPEN might limp through this quarter, but unless home prices rebound, they won't be able to hide the pain next quarter.

They claim they are targeting to pay market value, charging a 5-6% fee + repairs. If it costs them 4% in transfer fees and selling fees, they make 1-2% delta. Their idea is to reduce the friction in selling a home - you sell to us for convenience and you lose out on only 1-2%. You don’t have to deal with Reno, updates, staging, people walking through your home, etc. This is appealing to many sellers. As a Realtor myself, I still think the current Realtor method is better and will net more unless they are taking losses. There will likely be price compression on commissions and less agents doing more volume to compete with Z. Eventually if margin gets squeezed, iBuyers won’t have much success as they are running on such thin margins to start with and the cost to buy and sell is expensive with taxes having to be paid on both sides. \n\nThere is also accusations that they are trying to buy homes in an area, then buy a few at higher prices to jack up comps in the area to make a profit. Making losers on a few, but gains on others. \n\nBeing in the industry, I think it is a very complex problem to solve and there’s so many people who do this (investors, flippers, wholesalers etc) and have been for a long time. Those people are likely to be the most affected by these types of iBuyer (imo) and many Realtors won’t survive, but the best will likely thrive due to friction of transaction costs and at some point Z, OPAD, etc won’t really be able to compete unless they overpay. So unless they want to be in the rental business, I think we’re a long way from these strategies being successful. \n\nI’m just not sure how sustainable this is long term. It’s hot right now and everyone’s trying to do it. As you said, you’ll shop all the buyers, essentially making them all compete, making margins and wins difficult.
