{"title": "DD: Corsair again $CRSR, bargain.", "selftext": "Good afternoon fellow apes, \n\n(excuse my English, no native speaker) I think it was about three months ago I was one of the happiest young adults in the world when Corsair squirted all the way above 40 dollars on WSB attention. Sadly, the apes left me in the dark. Well, not really. I got the opportunity to average down again. Right now, Corsair is sitting at around 25-26 dollars a share. At this point, it is a complete value stock with insane growth potential. You are not investing in some company which has insane revenue growth, yet no profits. Neither are you investing in a company with minor revenue growth but good profitability. You are investing in the best mix of this, insane growth paired with great profitability. Here, some bullish points.\n\n\\- Revenue growth. Last earnings report they reported under estimates. Revenues only grew 24% Q2 2020 to Q3 2020. What a bummer, or not? Wallstreet sees this as a covid play, 2020 they only grew their revenues largely because of covid. I would assume many gamers are here on this Reddit page: We can confirm that we still game. To further confirm this, there you have your 24% revenue growth. Q2 2020 can be considered one of the best quarters for Corsair, it was the start of stay-at-home. Everyone who needed equipment, would have bought it in that quarter since it was the first stay-at-home quarter. In May, we knew stay at home would be the norm so we knew we would game for a long time, hence most people would've bought in that quarter. Yet they still sold significantly more in Q2 2021, where the stay at home norm is less there. They still managed to outpace there already fast revenue growth. This does not even take into consideration all the supply chain issues which occurred that quarter (which is actually the bearish point, they have tons of supply chain issues). Further more, they launch new products every single week. Yes, every week. Recently they entered one big market, being the gaming monitor market. Corsair fanboys (and they are out there) will for sure swap out their current HP monitor and get that juicy RGB Corsair thing in there. They trade at around 1.1 times their revenue. What the F üòÇ\n\n\\- Profitability: Corsair is growing profitability. At the moment they trade around a 20 p/e-ish. Their forward PE is 16,6. This for a gaming company, launching products every week, having sweet subsidiaries, improving margins, paying off debt, idk you name it. It's not like you buy an old brick and mortar chain like Nordstrom or Macys with limited growth potential. How if this forward pe 16, What the F üòÇ\n\n\\- Subsidiaries: Let me just list them quick. Elgato, SCUF gaming, Gamer Sensei, Origin PC, Visuals by impuls. The first one is the most important one by far, and has perhaps even more potential than the latter ones all combined. Watch any middle-sized Twitch streamer or bigger. I bet my full Corsair position that they use an Elgato stream deck. This market, the market of streaming, is only growing and growing. It has become more popular every month. Not only do they have stream decks, but they since just a few months also provide webcams. They also provide other stream equipment such as green screens, their multimounts, lighting equipment, microphones etc. They are THE go to, premium brand when it comes to live streaming and will continue to be so in the forseeable future. \n\n\\- Short interest: Apes love crushing shorts. Sadly, I have barely any idea how short squeezes ACTUALLY work and which companies are primed to do so. I only know that Yahoo Finance shows me that 37.2% of Corsair their float has been shorted. Should be good for a squeeze I would imagine. Someone else can take a look at that, I am not that Larry. \n\n\\- Simply their products: Yes, simply their products. Just have a general thought about it, will gaming, streaming, and sick set-ups be bigger or smaller in 5-10 years from now? If you are not some sort of Boomer I would reckon everyone here would say bigger (and numbers back this up of course). They are EXACTLY in that growing market. They are the premium brand in this growing market. They provide the best keyboards, headsets, RAM-sticks, PC cases, cooling fans, power supplies etc you name it. Oh and the best RGB. \n\nI have to also go over some bearish points, because there are a few. \n\nFirst one being, they seem to be bleeding down for several weeks in a row. Idk when this is going to stop and what the bottom is. Second, they have debt. More debt than cash. Good thing is, this debt is being reduced quite fast and recently they paid off another 25M. With their great cash flows they seem to be able to pay it off quite fast, and I personally think they'll be debt free in about 4-5 years. Another downside is the supply issues. They are heavily affected by the chip shortage and other supply chain issues. Of course this affects revenues and margins. ON THE OTHER HAND, one could argue that even with supply chain issues they still manage to grow revenues over 20%, and are able to trade at a forward pe of 16. Imagine without those issues. Ye. Yeh. \n\nI can go on and on about their upsides and keep hyping this up, but I am already writing this under work time and I am typing for 30 minutes already, oops sorry Boss. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do your own DD, and take a look into this amazing companies. I think it is by far the best buy in this uncertain market circumstances. They are here to stay. \n\nPosition: 801 shares.

Failure to deliver on new products will harm their stock price while investors take a better look at the competition\n\n- They are mostly institutionally owned, EagleTree will most likely not completely act in CRSRs best interest. They also have nomination and voting rights for the majority of the board of directors. Politics could harm management as long as they hold their majority stake. \n\n- They are highly cyclical with Q1 and Q2 being historically worse than Q3 and Q4. This increases the volatility of the stock because of missed guidance. \n\n- They lease production facilities in Asia ( Taiwan) which could be a reason of concern regarding recent China - Taiwan news. Nonetheless, they are subject to import tariffs and unfavorable currency exchange ratios. \n\n- Their effective tax rate will most likely increase in the future which will harm retained earnings, and as such, our ROE. \n\n- They are somewhat correlated with holiday game releases and next gen consoles, so a flop there could  affect the stock negatively. \n\n- In case of an economic downturn gaming products are seen as a luxury and as such, are the first kind of purchases to be left aside. With the looming crash above us it might be a while until we see some worthwile returns on this stock.\n\nTheir 10K explains this and much more in higher amounts of detail so you might want to check that. \n\nAll in all, CRSR is a nice play for the long run.
