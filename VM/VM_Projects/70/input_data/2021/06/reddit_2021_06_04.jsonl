{"title": "NOK - Why it's gaining and being discussed.", "selftext": "NOK is not just a \"Meme\" stock.\n\nTL;DR NOK is just a great stock with huge growth in it's near future. It's not a short squeeze.\n\nThe reason NOK is being discussed so much is because it's rising in price. People are saying there's nothing about NOK that's special, it's been trading flat between $4.00 -$5.00 for the longest time and that 5G is not new. Well, there is a lot of things that are going well for NOK that does need some attention.\n\nNOK is currently undervalued. It's been trading stagnant between $4.00 - $5.00 for quite a while. They're the top leaders in 5G and telecommunications. They also control a large portion of the market share and have acquired more contracts than Ericsson. Ericsson is also another company that is doing well and should see continued growth as NOK but it's currently already trading around its fair value of $13.00. Huawei was a major competitor to both but that is no longer the case. As North America and many other countries across the globe have put sanctions on Huawei and China, tariffs, and claims of espionage, many countries are no longer doing business with Huawei or at least are moving away from them. That brings those clients to companies like NOK and Ericsson.\n\nNOK is not a cell phone maker anymore. They have completely redefined their business model. They're a multinational telecommunications, information technology, and consumer electronics company, and have been for a while. They're projected for massive growth between 2021-2026 and that's from 5G alone. They're already the leader in 6G development and put heavy R&D into it. The business model goes 2021-2026 5G implementation, after that it develops into 6G production. 5G isn't as new as everyone thinks and the majority of the Globe is behind on it's implementation.\n\nAdding that NOK is wanting to do share buy backs, possibility of a dividends being return, and overall growth, the future is looking great for NOK. They also killed their Q1 2021 earnings and are projected to be beating the market by 2023 in growth. People saying that it's history was trading flat also is another benefit as this stock will be a great hedge to inflation. Also, adding once this stock hits it's fair value, there will be more short interest that will develop from the price naturally. At that point, it could very well fall into a \"Meme\" stock category.\n\nBut right now, this is not a meme stock. The stock is being talked about and the price going up is not because of WSB, but because investors really want to invest long in NOK because of the company, sector, business, and price.\n\nThis stock is actually just a really good stock overall to invest in. It's not a short squeeze, but could develop into one possibly. It has accelerated growth in its future and people just like the stock, it's really that simple. Not all massive gains derive from short squeezes, just saying.\n\n**Edit:** The mods took my original post above down for some reason but didn't advised as to why. I think it's because I didn't highlight how money can be made from it that meets with the standards of WSB, so I added the information below.\n\nNOK is also in negotiations to do a 550M share buy back, which is 10% of the public float which will also increase their EPS.\n\nProposal of the Board of Directors:\n\n[https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2021/02/04/proposals-of-the-board-of-directors-to-nokia-corporations-annual-general-meeting-2021/](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2021/02/04/proposals-of-the-board-of-directors-to-nokia-corporations-annual-general-meeting-2021/)\n\nApart from NOKIA's expected growth over the next half a decade to a full decade cycle. The options contracts are dirt cheap at the moment. You can buy far out leaps for next to nothing. I hold both shares and options. My predictions, NOK hits $10 minimum EOY.\n\n**Final Edit:** This post was just to clarify why the stock is moving upwards and that it's price is not going up because of WSB or any Short Squeeze Interest.\n\nNOKIA Q1 Earnings: [Here](https://www.nokia.com/system/files/2021-04/nokia_results_2021_q1.pdf)\n\nNOK versus Ericsson Contracts: [Here](https://i.redd.it/ujb6t0x5qwj61.png)\n\nNOK Ranked #1 in 5G Patents: [Here](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/04/28/2218442/0/en/Nokia-ranked-as-number-one-in-5G-patents.html)", "id": "nshllb", "created_utc": 1622846750.0, "score": 160, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "num_comments": 78, "comments": [{"body": "Killer analysis bro.
