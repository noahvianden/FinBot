When they're well prepared, these places are geographically separated and the cold sites are disconnected from any network. They're hardened against bombs and physical intrusion. They might lose recent data in the process of restoring it, but there's a lot of other mitigations that prevent a total loss of availability, such as having failover routes in case of network outages, multiple redundant servers that are geographically and virtually separated, creating accounts with the principal of least privilege and delegation of duties to remove the possibility that a single compromised account can do as much damage.\n\n\nBasically, if they have a good cybersecurity policy in place and pay those people well, any attack that will cause the kind of damage you're talking about would require multiple acts of war to accomplish.
