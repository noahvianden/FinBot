{"title": "AAPL Jun 2023 $120.00 call x 20 contracts", "selftext": "Cost per contract:\n$23.40\n\nStock price at time of purchase (June 11, 2021):\n$127.15\n\nWhy:\nApple has remained flat for most of the past year. It first reached its current price in August 2020. Since then, much new hardware and software has been released, and the stock market has not yet responded favorably. \n\nBased on the latest swaths of advances unveiled at WWDC, I believe that this trend will end soon. Companies that take advantage of users’ trust will look less appealing to investors. Meanwhile, more companies will become part of the Apple ecosystem when iOS 15 is rolled out to the general public, which will allow third-party cross platform use of Apple technology, like FaceTime, Apple TV, and Apple Music through newly announced SharePlay.\n\nI expect that people who sold AAPL last year and earned profits elsewhere in tech like GOOG, MSFT, AMZN, and FB will begin investing back into Apple. The outcomes of anti-trust trials and other lawsuits are unlikely to affect Apple severely in the next two years. However, investors might fear that competitors will become less profitable. \n\nAll of this, along with the consumer privacy awakening, stable quarterly revenue, growth of services like fitness+ and tv+, rumors of revolutionary products (and their anticipated future announcements), plus philanthropic investments in property (Bay Area housing), will make Apple look like a smart investing opportunity for the next 5 years.\n\nWhile some people may be bearish on this stock, it’s important to remember we are only months away from an iOS 15 release, macOS Monterrey release, and the traditional September hardware release.\n\nExit strategy:\n- Sell or exercise 10 contracts at $53.45. Then exercise the remainder in two years.\n- Sell all immediately if at any point the value of contract decreases to $17.55.\n\nProof: https://imgur.com/gallery/CqarM1R", "id": "nxt9u1", "created_utc": 1623454459.0, "score": 35, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "num_comments": 97, "comments": [{"body": "Does it make sense to exercise leaps so early?

The debit paid is the price of the long leg minus the price of the short leg and the max gain is the gap in strikes minus debit paid.\n\nIn OP's case, this position could be turned into a vertical spread by selling calls on AAPL with the same expiration date and higher strike prices. The premium received for opening the short position is considered a reduction in cost basis of the long calls. \n\nThis strategy sets a cap on potential returns since the short positon will eventually have a similar/identical delta to the long position, i.e. the short position will generate loss as quickly as the long position generates profit. This will occur as both the long and short position become very deep ITM.\n\nI have recently been following the advice of some users on this sub and turning my long call positions into spreads after they have already become profitable.

A group of investors, including Palantir, committed to invest a combined $230 million into the Babylon transaction...\n\n...By participating in the PIPE, or private investment in public equity, Palantir is guaranteed ownership of a certain amount of stock once the transaction closes and the shares in the operating company start trading.\n\nWhile many tech companies like Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) have large venture groups that back start-ups at various stages, Palantir’s focus on SPACs is unique among strategic investors. It means Palantir is betting on more mature companies that are often already valued in the billions of dollars.\"\n\n# PLTR vs Tyler Technologies, Verint, Splunk, and Cognizant\n\n* Cognizant lagging\n* Others in a uptrend\n* Tyler Technologies on a rocket ship.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tzowz5kjbp471.png?width=3254&format=png&auto=webp&s=84397da7bafffd00d433817e9a36d414e11762fe\n\n# 6/11 Total Flow\n\n* Strong close for PLTR\n* 83.3% bullish\n* 77% call volume\n* 71% ask\n* 96.8% call premium\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wroxdlycdp471.png?width=3450&format=png&auto=webp&s=f91eb28f61f137066123dc1d13311f8882a826f6\n\n# $26c 7/9 unusual whal alert on 6/10\n\n[Unusual Whale Alert](https://preview.redd.it/957tm5wacp471.png?width=1496&format=png&auto=webp&s=39c8aec29748f567ff4a2d1a8b7ff5af011bc838)\n\n# Big option trades around alert\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ohjy3tadcp471.png?width=1476&format=png&auto=webp&s=d7d40d8712ee6dedf1d6dddd95cbfc85d7dc4c29\n\n# Six found in the flow - 4 to 2 bullish\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7scyl636cp471.png?width=2678&format=png&auto=webp&s=253616663a41c103d2273a3b5a4e45418fa8bbc3\n\n# BarChart Put/Call Ratio\n\nThe Volume numbers reflect options traded during the current session.\n\nPut Volume Total: 68,054\n\nCall Volume Total: 253,701\n\nPut/Call Volume Ratio: 0.27\n\nPut Open Interest Total: 1,064,215\n\nCall Open Interest Total: 2,002,737\n\nPut/Call Open Interest Ratio: 0.5\n\n# TA Notes\n\nBoth the short term and long term trends are positive.
