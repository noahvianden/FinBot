I've heard way too many bad things about them from my very tech savvy co-workers who much prefer AMD & ARM processors.

This isn't a high horse thing.  Anyways,  \n\nIntel's architecture is built to excel at single thread handling.  While AMD has significantly improved their single thread performance over the years,  Intel still leads on IPC (Instructions per clock). \n\nNow,  the really important part. Intel leads on IPC in regards to power consumption.  Intel does not use as much power.  This is why (1) most current game engines are optimized for Intel and (2) most datacenters use servers with Intel CPUs. \n\nIt's also really interesting to see the Apple MI architecture showing up. Up until recently,  the industry built almost entirely around Intel,  AMD, and ARM; so we'll see.  \n\nAMD has focused primarily on multi-thread processing and have excelled heavily at it for quite a while (going as far back as the Athlon series). More recently,  AMD has been focusing on the \"all around consumer CPU.\" Ever since they moved to 7nm, they are coming very close to Intel on single thread as well. \n\nAMD uses a lot more power and it turn, runs hotter. While AMD kicks ass at multi-core, the power consumption is not ideal for datacenters since 99% of servers work in the business world are single thread processes.  However,  AMD excels in the consumer market for things like video editing and gaming+streaming.  While Intel can definitely do the job,  AMD is winning in that world.  \n\nOn top of this,  AMD has had a stellar PR run these last few years.\n\nThe interesting thing is that AMD TSMC 7nm is almost the same size as Intel 14nm +++, at least for node size,  gate length,  and half- pitch.  But the big difference is transistor density.  Intel 10 nm and TSMC 7nm processes both produce dies with approx 90 million transistors per sq millimetre and at 150MT/mm² for 7nm and 5nm (Intel's next flagship series is going to be 5nm).\n\nThe next aspect is consistency.  I can send you a couple of very lengthy,  detailed videos showing this (if you'd like). Intel wins at consistency.  What I mean by that is, when Intel says \"this processor gives you 2.8GHz,\" it will,  almost always, be 2.8GHz. We're talking 99.95%. \n\nIn AMD's case, that same statement is more around 96-97% of the time.  While that number doesn't seem like a big difference,  consistency is everything.  AMD processors have been shown to downclock by estimated usage.  Is that damaging? No. But, consistency is very important.  HOWEVER\n\nOverclocking. AMDs deficit of consistency is also one of its greatest strengths.  AMD has insane overclock opportunity and those unlocked cores are fantastic.  \n\nMy point here is that neither AMD or Intel is better than the other, overall.  They are better at different things.  You want  consistent, cooler, single thread power? Intel.  You want a multi-thread, hotter, beast of a machine? AMD. Are you a business owner looking to host your company servers? Intel.  You game and stream? AMD. \n\nHeck,  ARM architecture kicks AMD and Intel to the floor in some use cases too. \n\nIt's all about use case. If anyone touts one over the other,  they haven't done their research. They're both great,  at different things. \n\nEdited: misspelled", "score": 5, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "They have a new CEO now though, one with impressive technical chops and the right combination of engineering and management credentials.

Sometimes there are good stocks caught up in memes crazes and it may be worth selling way OTM puts on them. If you set up a target of 2% per month on your cash you could actually take a 0.05 delta that gives you 1% in a week on a IV explosion and take it to expiration.\n\nYou can use basic TA for entry and for some exits. Just basic common sense stuff like if the stock has been on a month long downtrend in a bull market then don’t try to catch that knife...enter instead a position in stock that are trading in a range or up and do it on down days. You can also time your entries and jump in in days like today when SPY sits on the 50dma and is oversold on 5d RSI...lighten up on positions when the market gets to overbought and stays there foe a week or 2. On exit, you could pay attention to major support levels and just bail if the positions don’t work. Taking a early loss can save you some read pain later.   \n\n\nLastly, you could actively hedge with some call credit spreads in stocks that are struggling during market bull runs or with VIX CSPs when the market gets complacent.   \n\n\nThis helped me get a 43-1 record last month with a average hold of 9 days and a 2.3% gain on total portfolio with maximum BP allocation at around 35% during the may mini crash.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for the tips.

{"title": "TSLA Upcoming 4 for 1 Stock Split - An Elon Musk Twitter Analysis", "selftext": "Last year Elon Musk tweeted that \"Tesla stock price is too high imo\". Most people did not think too much of this as they thought he was referring to the then recent price action. However, when the 5 for 1 stock split happened in august later that year, some keen eyes noticed that he was actually referring to a split.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gd2ixiclhz571.png?width=740&format=png&auto=webp&s=755c06a09499b39b429a492e67190e41478d5372\n\nHe tweeted it at 8:11am PT on 5/1. The 5 for 1 stock split was announced on 8/11.\n\n[Tesla Announces a Five-for-One Stock Split | Tesla Investor Relations](https://ir.tesla.com/press-release/tesla-announces-five-one-stock-split)\n\nSo why do I think he is hinting at another split? There are a few clues on his twitter as well as several recent tweets that point at an upcoming 4 for 1 split next week on 6/23. First piece of evidence is a recent tweet about appealing to small audiences (i.e. retail investors).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/blo3ms45iz571.png?width=592&format=png&auto=webp&s=3dbbf2cc89dcd10a9a04460c47c221f67ab92f99\n\nBesides this tweet talking about appealing to small audiences, this was tweeted on 4/1. Similar to the last tweet, it was tweeted on the first of a month so it could possible refer to a 4 for 1 stock split. While this was tweeted at 3:23am PT, if you use the time zone that the markets are based on then it would be 6:23am EST which could be hinting at 6/23.\n\nWhile this might not be enough evidence for some, there are a few other potential hints. First of all, he recently changed his name to \"Elon Musk, the 2nd\" which could be referring to the second stock split.\n\nFurthermore, he has been tweeting some more cryptic tweets such as a recent talking about GME and AMC.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bw87j61djz571.png?width=597&format=png&auto=webp&s=dbd74f28b426161b14ac8854c257a12e030564f4\n\nHe could be referring to the sequel of the TSLA short squeeze. He has made fun of short sellers in the past and it would not be surprising if he is referring to an upcoming stock split as being the catalyst for this sequel.\n\nAssuming that there is a stock split announced after market close next Wednesday on 6/23, calls could be a good play. Last stock split announcement saw a 13%+ rise the day after as well as an 80%+ rise between the announcement and the actual split which was roughly two weeks later.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPositions: TSLA 6/25 650C & TSLA 7/9 800C\n\nTLDR; Elon Musk hinting at 4 for 1 stock split on 6/23.

Importantly: the second cross is at a lower point than the first cross, and thus it diverges with the underlying direction of the stock price (which is positive).\n\nThe RSI is also at a lower point on June 17th than it was on Aril 23, despite the underlying price going up.\n\nBelow is everything I've described thus far summed up in a doodle:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vabpwvs9s3671.jpg?width=1108&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3bbdc21acb8bf33d5b1245b33d68e7d63cc73040\n\nGenerally, when you see the indicators moving in a bearish direction while the stock is moving in a bullish direction it can be an indication that the stock price may reverse.

Here, we can we can see a full candle close below the 9-day MA on 6/17 and a full close below the 50-day on 6/18.
