Here are three reasons why you should never participate in this cuckoldry:\n\n1. People should be adding to their winners instead of doubling down on their mistakes.  People adding to Apple over the last ten years are way smarter than the people who “averaged down” on BlackBerry (no disrespect to the BB apes going wild on this stock today I love the work you do 🦍🦍🦍)\n\n2. Changing the number you see on the screen doesn’t mean you lost any less money.  Actually means you’ll lose more money cause it’s gonna go down again\n\n3. This is the most important reason.  When you average down it dilutes your loss porn.  It makes it way harder for me and the rest of us here on this sub to cum 💦 and I want to see those big beautiful red negative numbers light up while they’re edging me closer and closer… getting closer and closer to -100% 👀.  Sure I can just imagine them being lower and know that you probably lost even more money doing this but it’s not the same.
