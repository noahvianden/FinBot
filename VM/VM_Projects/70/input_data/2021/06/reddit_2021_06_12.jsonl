{"title": "CLNE Annual Shareholders Meeting on June 14th @ 9am PST", "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\n\"We are excited about the Annual Meeting, particularly because it provides our stockholders an opportunity to approve a component of what we believe is an important commercial partnership for Clean Energy. On April 16, 2021, in connection with entering into a Project Addendum to Fuel Pricing Agreement (the “Fuel Agreement”) with a subsidiary of Amazon.com, Inc. (“Amazon”), we entered into a Transaction Agreement with Amazon under which we issued to another subsidiary of Amazon a warrant (the “Amazon Warrant”) to purchase up to an aggregate of 53,141,755 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $13.49 per share, which was 21.3% more than the $11.12 closing price of our common stock on April 15, 2021.\n\nThrough the Fuel Agreement and Amazon Warrant, our board of directors (the “Board”) believes Amazon can become an important strategic partner for Clean Energy. Further, Amazon is purchasing low and negative carbon Renewable Natural Gas (“RNG”) from Clean Energy, which we believe validates using RNG as a transportation fuel at scale. We expect to provide RNG to Amazon through 27 existing fueling stations and 19 non-exclusive new or upgraded stations that we expect to construct by the end of the year. The new and existing stations will provide RNG in 15 different states across the United States, and we will own all the stations.\n\nThe Warrant Shares vest in multiple tranches, the first of which for 13,283,445 Warrant Shares vested upon execution of the Fuel Agreement. Subsequent tranches will vest over time based on fuel purchases by Amazon and its affiliates, up to a total of $500 million, excluding any payments attributable to “Pass Through Costs,” which consist of all costs associated with the delivered cost of gas and applicable taxes determined by reference to the selling price, gallons or gas sold. Importantly, if all the vesting conditions of the Amazon Warrant are satisfied, Amazon will have purchased hundreds of millions of gasoline gallon equivalents (“GGEs”) of RNG at today’s fuel prices from Clean Energy.\n\nWe believe a commercial partnership with Amazon will enhance our strategies, initiatives and efforts to achieve our goals to grow fleet and other consumer support for the use of RNGasavehicle fuel for our target customers and geographies. The Board also believes the proceeds from the issuance of our common stock to Amazon in the event Amazon were to vest and then exercise the Amazon Warrant in part or whole for cash, would enhance our liquidity in support of our operations, as well as our ability to execute our business plans and pursue opportunities for further growth. Accordingly, we believe securing this commercial partnership and incenting Amazon to purchase the maximum amount of fuel under the Fuel Agreement is important for the trajectory of Clean Energy. \"", "id": "nyk41x", "created_utc": 1623542249.0, "score": 787, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 247, "comments": [{"body": "Quick!

So you’ll have to keep that in mind from my off the cuff explanation. Basically in your example you’re correct. But don’t forget you have the ability to sell that call you bought for a higher premium, example near the end. \n\nBuying a call is a contract to be able to purchase 100 shares, at whatever strike you chose by the expiration date. Only if the share price is higher than your strike price at close on the date of expiration can it be executed. Some brokers allow early execution as well. \n\nAs an example to show my most recent success with options I give you this, I bought x40 $40 1/22/22 BB calls in March for an average of $52 apiece. So I had just over $2k invested. Two weeks ago I sold those calls for an average price of $620 apiece. That was about $22k in profit. Now let’s say that instead of rocketing up like BB did for me, it crashed hard. Well if by that expiration date of 1/22/22 it still wasn’t close to $40 or even going up, it would basically be worth $0. And I’d have only lost what I invested initially ($2k). \n\nNow back to present day. I have x120 $13 calls that expire this coming Friday on CLNE. I stand to lose around $12k if I don’t sell those calls by Friday. Now the closer we get to Friday and the share price stays under $13, my premium value of each contract(average of $101 per) will steadily drop. But, if the share price starts to climb like crazy and even pass $13, they raise in premium value. Which I hope is the case of course.

There is no need to gamble on a specific date for your expiration.\n\n Example: The play is by 6/18, you assume the price is going to moon bc of shorts covering. Playing the 6/18 calls might not be the best choice. If you buy  july or sept Calls  you get more time value and a higher a Delta. So if the price moons you get more per $1 move in the stock price. Plus, you keep time if the price move even higher later. Obviously you pay more now in premiun but you get a chance to cash in more and you can always sell the call back if the price goes the other way bc you have time value.

The expiration is when that right is lost. The amount of time left and a stocks price, determines the options value.\n\nThey can also become illiquid and hard to close, especially near the expiration date.
