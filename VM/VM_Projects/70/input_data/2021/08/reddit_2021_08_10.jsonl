Hell interstates and highways weren't there for quite some time, people still rode horse and the train. The government building highways all over the place really pushed ICE cars to the forefront. Now they're moving onto EVs. These national projects will always be time consuming and costly, but I can't argue against this decision- it's actually a good thing. Yes, we do not have the power grid now capable of a project like this...similarly to the big ICE push the infrastructure needs to be developed. Adversity breeds creativity.

I don’t like the idea of the government throwing money at something inefficient like a Tesla semi just because it’s green. The fact you can get tax credits for owning EV’s is just bizarre to me, and doesn’t even make sense.
