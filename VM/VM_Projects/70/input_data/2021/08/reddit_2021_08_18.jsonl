The good thing is, and I try to tell everyone here, go start your own business as your full time job and do the Market as a side hustle.  Best lesson I ever learned in life.

I like business models with no inventory and residuals. You have to get a real estate license maybe even a broker license.  Get a percentage of each house you rent and when something breaks find someone to fix the problem and upcharge 10 percent or so.  Also you could do a landscape company with this.   Maybe even a cleaning company.  Get deals with the cable company to sell to the new renters and any other product you can think of.
