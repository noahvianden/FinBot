{"title": "PIRATE GANG - YO HO HO AND A BOTTLE OF XO ($ZIM)", "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\nArrr matey! Are you ready to begin plundering the high seas with your favourite Israeli shipping company?\n\n$ZIM - ZIM Integrated Shipping Services this week they released their Q2 financials. It was a monster beat. $7.40 eps against $6.05 eps consensus. ZIM reported net income of $888 million for Q2 2021 compared to $25 million in Q2 2020.\n\nNow let's think about this for a second.  They currently have a $4.8billion market cap.  They paid off all their debt and had $650mil net income last quarter and Q2 $888 million. They've put down $1.4B in net profit this year and we're only halfway through the year.\n\n  \nSurely this can't continue.. Shipping is going to normalize soon.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWrong.  Have fun getting your 2021 Christmas presents in 2022.  You've probably been hearing about it for 6 months now.  Shipping prices are through the roof.  Shipping companies are the most profitable they've ever been? Companies are abandoning containers after finding out the shipping costs are more than the net value of the goods within them. How long can this really last? The rates must be coming down..  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q34bzvvtlii71.png?width=442&format=png&auto=webp&s=4135dc1c3247b07d90fbaeb416ceb420033685ca\n\nWrong. When you started hearing about the insanity of shipping prices it was probably around June.  Even Biden came out and said it was unfair that they were making so much money and he would do something about it (narrator: he didn't).  Okay, 2nd quarter in a row with record results, but surely their guidance must have been poor?  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eg7qiz8slii71.jpg?width=922&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=65da6e18a0877ea06146a17d133de47ca236d822\n\nHoly shit! Doubling their guidance. The stock must be exploding!! Nope. ZIM has been in steady decline since releasing the results -- even with a $2 dividend with an ex-dividend Tuesday next week. Probably the most undervalued company on the stock market today. Why aren't the institutions interested in it?  Well, they are.  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aul2eq5olii71.png?width=369&format=png&auto=webp&s=042add975e2f1c74752e6c1e219ec1312b2baa36\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCurrent Price: $43.50\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPRICE TARGETS\n\nMINTZMYER - $70\n\nCITY - $74\n\nCLARKSON'S - $90\n\nJEFFERIES - $70 - $100\n\nGOLDMAN SACHS - $26.50 (also upped their stake by 411% in Q2 oopsie!)", "id": "p858gm", "created_utc": 1629466230.0, "score": 102, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 72, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|4 days ago\n**Total Comments**|2|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|3 weeks|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n    \nHey /u/zombie_autist_savant, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "EBITDA EQUAL TO MARKET CAP\n\nmay have to back up the truck", "score": 21, "replies": [{"body": "- Peter Lynch", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "what does this mean in english, mcap severally undervalued ?", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "essentially, roughly with what they're making this year they could buy back all their stock at the current valuation, for reference UPS does 10 billion of ebitda and has a $160 billion market cap", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "I’ve done a good amount of DD on this and everything points to buy… what am i missing… just not enough hype? why is it undervalued so much", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "might be that they are currently getting lumped in with other bad actors in the shipping industry.
