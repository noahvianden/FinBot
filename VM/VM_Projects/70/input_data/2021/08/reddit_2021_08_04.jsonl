The question is: how much more can it go? Well, I put together some quick numbers and it seems it is still very cheap. I focused on Market Cap / Turnover, which is a ratio that I personally like a lot.\n\n\tNVDA\n\n|Year|Turnover|Growth|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|2018|11,716||\n|2019|10,918|\\-6.8%|\n|2020|16,675|52.7%|\n|TTM|19,256|15.5%|\n|2018-Today||64.36%|\n|Market Cap|492B||\n|MC / TO|25.6||\n\n\t\n\nAMD\n\n|Year|Turnover|Growth|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|2018|6,475||\n|2019|6,731|3.9%|\n|2020|9,763|45%|\n|TTM|13,340|36.6|\n|2018-Today||106%|\n|Market Cap|132B||\n|MC / TO|9.9||\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs you can see above, MC/TO ratio on NVDIA is almost 3x higher than on AMD despite AMD having higher recent growth. It is obvious that this is not the only ratio that matters and other factors come into play when pricing a stock, but AMD is an incredible growth stock and I strongly believe it will keep crushing on Turnover and closing the MC/TO gap to NVDA. Even a small increase from 9.9 to 12 would mean an additional 20% in stock price assuming current Turnover, which will be history very soon given the rapid growth.\n\nFinally, it is important to note that NVDA is up 45% in the past 6 months vs 28% for AMD and this is mostly due to the XLNX acquisition, which brought concerns to investors. Recent numbers from XLNX have given some comfort to the market.\n\nTL/DR: AMD still cheap.
