Futures at the moment are trading at a healthy level after yesterday‚Äôs small decline. It seems to me that people are buying as much stock as possible before the Fed changes policy. I also know that there‚Äôs a lot of cash on the sidelines with investors itching to jump in and buy up on any meaningful level of correction. \n\nBut even with uncertainty of Fed policy as well as inflation hovering in the background, there‚Äôs the whole issue of Covid. The economy hasn‚Äôt completely reopened, unemployment isn‚Äôt at the level before Covid, and there‚Äôs the risk of more resilient strains emerging because enough people aren‚Äôt getting vaccinated. \n\nSo I think the next year could be one of the following: \n\n1. Covid goes away for the most part or is easily manageable through increased vaccinations, no additional serious strains emerge. The economy reopens and the Fed gently and slowly increases rates. We have less growth than this year but still stable. \n\n2. Inflation is much worse than predicted and the economy slows significantly. The Fed has to increase rates faster. The question is how this turns out depends on the Covid situation.  If Covid doesn‚Äôt go away, then what does the Fed do in this situation? The risk is if the virus mutates again and the vaccines are less effective. \n\nI‚Äôm just thinking openly and have no idea about anything but with Covid, rates, record levels of participation in the market, there‚Äôs a lot of uncertainty.

{"title": "SPX Iron Condors for consistent income - Critique my strategy please", "selftext": "So I've been trying to create a strategy that generates some sort of consistent monthly/annualized return.\n\nBasically, sell the 45DTE Iron Condor on SPX. Let's use a 0.2 delta for the put side and 0.1 on the call side and then 50pt wide wings. The spot price generally lands right in the middle of the wings offsetting any skew. 0.2delta on the put side - SPX has to dive 6% to breach the long strike here, seems pretty unlikely in these circumstances. 0.1 delta on the call side - this is as low as delta gets - the way I see it, SPX has to moon big time to breach it, so 0.1 seems like a safe bet. \n\nSetting up a condor like this requires around 5k of capital/BPR. It yields around 8.5 to 1.1 credit received depending on VIX levels. (8.5 around 17vix, 1.1 around 22vix). So thats $850 to $1100 max profit per condor.\n\nOffhand, according to tastytrade, the SPX:VIX price change ratio is -15:1 - for every 15pt drop in SPX VIX rises by 1. Assuming it takes a 275pt drop to breach my long strike, that is an 18pt increase in the VIX. Let's take it that the VIX trades at an average of 18pts. This is a 100% increase in VIX for a 275pt drop. \n\nMy plan is to use UVXY to hedge the downside against any black swan event or market crash that would cause a breach of the put side. Assuming for a VIX rise of 100%, and UVXY is levered 150%, a 275pt drop in SPX should yield a 3x return on the UVXY. Hence, for downside protection of $4000, I need a hedge of value $1350.\n\nThis works out to cost around $6350 (cost of opening IC + VIX), yielding a return of $487.5, assuming that we manage the trade consistently at 50% profit. This is a 7.6% return over a 30day period (let's just say that the condors are closed at 30 days and not held till expiry). Annualizing this gives a return of 91.2%. This return could potentially be higher since the hedge is \"reusable\", ie - it's an ETF that we bought and own and can be reused for the same strategy down the road. Consider the $1350 spent on purchasing the hedge as \"insurance\" - so future trades require only $5000 capital, but for convenience's sake let's take it at 6350. \n\nWhat are the drawbacks of this strategy other than SPX mooning and breaching the call side? Perhaps I might be miscalculating how the hedge works. But if this strategy works, it's as close to set and forget as I imagine. No more fussing around with small caps and using screeners to find high IV stocks. Perhaps some rolling of strikes occasionally but that's it, we can all sit on a beach with a beer and watch SPX try and breach a call side delta of 0.1.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?", "id": "pccwxs", "created_utc": 1630026578.0, "score": 55, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 70, "comments": [{"body": "The drawback is that this play has to stay VERY mechanical; all spreads are very much a \"it works until it doesn't\" play in that one bad loss will wipe out months of gains.

That‚Äôs what callenkc indicates, and what I have also seen so far.\n\nThen to maintain a 2-month ladder in VIX call spreads - I have Sep and Oct VIX 18/37.5 call spreads on; next week, roll Sep to Nov,.  With the long strike $1-2 OTM (so right where it is now for me - I‚Äôve got $18/$37.5 VIX Sep and Oct call spreads vs Fridays close of 16.39) - is around $2ish (of course may vary good or bad based on where VIX is at roll-time).  That creates a 2-month ladder (eg carrying 2 nearer-term VIX spreads).  I opted as near-term as I could, as a VIX spike will throttle the near-term options more than long-term (because VIX options are tied to the futures, not spot).  So at 1x, that would roughly half-hedge a $40-wide SPX spread against a VIX 28 event (call that a 3% SPX drop - eg a $10 gain on the 2 VIX spreads for $20), or near-fully hedge a VIX 40+ event (market totally craps the bed).  So to fully-hedge a VIX 28 event, would need 2x in VIX spreads to cover a $40 SPX spread.\n\nSO, I am looking at it like this:  if I can collect $2-3 of credit per WEEK on the SPX weeklies (or $8-$12 per month) on an ongoing basis - giving-up 25-30% if that in monthly VIX hedge expense is worth it, if it lets me play with a bigger piece of my account than would be ‚Ä¶ otherwise recommended.  ;)\n\nTo wit, from 7/16-8/20, I took in $12.60 in net credit in my SPX account - and that included eating a defensive roll on the 7/19 gap-down.  At that time, my VIX hedge was further OTM and narrower - $20/$30.  It didn‚Äôt print quite how I wanted on 7/19, even though I was still able to manage SPX by defensive roll- so shifted to the $18/$37.5.\n\nSo if (IF!) I can net that ~$12 on the SPX Weekly side per-month - paying $2 (half-hedge a VIX 28 event) to $4 (fully-hedge) seems‚Ä¶ worth it, maybe?  E.g. if it lets me allocate more of my account to the SPX Weekly play?  And then if the market TOTALLY craps it - I come out ahead.\n\n‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the theory!‚Äù - about 6 weeks in.  So will see how realistically the VIX hedges can be rolled drag-wise and how they print in spikes; will see how I really am at executing defensive SPX rolls and managing my emotions, and if ‚Äúgood‚Äù - may reduce the VIX hedge some (go more OTM, narrow the spread, only hedge half, etc).", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "> SO, I am looking at it like this: if I can collect $2-3 of credit per WEEK on the SPX weeklies (or $8-$12 per month) on an ongoing basis - giving-up 25-30% if that in monthly VIX hedge expense is worth it, if it lets me play with a bigger piece of my account than would be ‚Ä¶ otherwise recommended. ;)\n\nThis was really my initial thought: giving up a small bit of those winnings on SPX for a hedge in case the SPX really tanks and the VIX spikes.

{"title": "MU, the most undervalued semi stock, has 20-30% upside potential in a month, 70-100% upside potential in 3-6 months. The sentiment has been changed to bullish this week, a GREAT TIME TO BUY.", "selftext": " Most great semi stocks are already priced in or overvalued, and we smart experienced apes know that you never buy overvalued stocks because its potential gain is small and its potential loss is too big.\n\nTherefore, we need to buy the stock that is undervalued but eventually goes up to meet its price target later because of its strong fundamentals and future growth (which is MU). And why do we need to pick semi stocks for this? Because Semiconductor business is one of the most potential and profitable business in the whole industry; we simply think that everything is turning to digital and AI systems, and all those devices, platforms, and servers need memory chips. Biden's infrastructure bills and his willingness to support semi industry are also tailwinds of semi stocks.\n\nOk, so why MU is the most undervalued stock among all semiconductors now?\n\nBecause it is ridiculously cheap! 7x forward price to earnings multiple now, and even though it actually have a slowdown in memory chip industry, it is still 10-12x forward earnings which is still ridiculously cheap compared to other semi stocks. (According to Quint Tatro, Joule Financial founder at CNBC).\n\nMU's 52 week high is 96.96, and its current price is 72.77. It showed some high volatility and corrections after its ATH because it went up too fast in short time (52 week low is 43.67). The last large correction made MU's price down from 83 to 68.80 which was 17% down in 4 days. This correction happened because of Morgan Stanley's report that says 'winter is coming' for semis. However, all other institutions and investors, including Goldman Sachs, Bofa, Jim Cramer, think that MU is way undervalued, and its price is at the bottom now. Vanguard Group, Sanders Capital, and State Street, top 5 MU shareholders, added MU positions between August 6 to August 16 . Since many institutions and large investors start to buy MU back, its price went up from 68 to 77, and then it dropped to 73 today due to the red market and some sell offs.\n\nReasons why this is a great timing to buy MU now\n\n1. The sentiment turned to bullish. It kept going up since it hit its bottom price 68, and yesterday, August 25th, it pumped from 73 to 77 in few minutes, closed at 74, and the current price is 72.77 now. Great buying point before it keeps pumping after this Jackson Hole meeting.\n2. Too CHEAP compared to ALL other semis. Here is the picture.\n\n[As you can see, MU is -23.64&#37; from 52 week High on August 25, it has a more discount today since it dropped to 72.77. Ok, then we might doubt about its fundamentals and its future growth. Don't worry, here is why most analysts and institutions think MU is super undervalued and it is time to buy now.](https://preview.redd.it/dlkwd2twtsj71.png?width=1522&format=png&auto=webp&s=320db86cfa01137884d5738472075d85b9f5bc78)\n\n[Its FY1 is 12.13 which is already great, but its FY2 and 3 is 6.36 and 6.34 which is too great compared to others. So, it is a great time to buy it before all those number soar later.](https://preview.redd.it/4o837srxtsj71.png?width=1233&format=png&auto=webp&s=021afd568ab356ba677378e791f117c4bedef258)\n\nTheir EPS and Revenue growth are also great too (beating all estimates for over 2 years).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j65bzmrytsj71.png?width=1099&format=png&auto=webp&s=76f6143cca80476247088955c96ff2d31d03e2b6\n\n3. Morgan Stanley, aka sneaky bitches, revealed a report 'winter is coming' or whatever, saying that DRAM memory chip price was already at the peak and it is going down now which will lead all DRAM company's profit to go down due to its historical data. However, most institutions and investors still believe that DRAM's demand is still too strong enough to cover that DRAM price drop, because all PCs, Servers, Laptops, smartphones, tablets, robots, cars, and anything that has automated computer system needs 'memory chip'. Semi industry has a bright future, and I think Morgan Stanley's report was just a manipulation in order to short the stock and buying it back at discounted price. This asshole bought SK hynix (2nd largest DRAM company) shares back after its correction in Korea. Its price was 120,000 Won before MS's report, and it dropped to 98,000 after its report and they started buying back from 100,000 now. I still strongly believe that this stock will keep going up before tapering. (I hope the Fed does not mention about tapering at Jackson Hole).\n\n4. RSI number is important because we can know if the stock is overbought or not. The current market sentiment is unstable due to upcoming tapering, interest rates, inflation, national debts, infrastructure, etc. and most overbought stock have a high chance to meet its huge corrections later. Ok, so MU's current monthly RSI is 57. It is still in the middle which is a great number for tech growth stock. For example, Nvidia's monthly RSI is 86, AMD's monthly RSI is 85, AMAT is 75, TSM is 76, Qualcomm is 65, and ASML is 93. RSI does not explain everything, but it helps you to know that MU is pretty undervalued.\n\n5. Most great investors always say 'being simple is the best strategy'. I also believe that. Simply, we will make the money if we buy the GOOD stock in cheap way and sell it in expensive way. And simply, MU, a GOOD stock, is cheap now.\n\n6. Here is a better explanation about MU itself (my first MU DD) that shows why MU is a GOOD stock. [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/osbr7k/micron\\_will\\_eventually\\_rally\\_5080\\_upside\\_potential/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/osbr7k/micron_will_eventually_rally_5080_upside_potential/)\n\nThere is a high chance that the Fed will not mention about tapering at Jackson Hole meeting because of Delta variant problems and slower than expected economy recovery. If they don't, tech stocks have a higher chance to get pumped for a while, and indeed, undervalued stocks have the highest chance to soar. So I personally strongly believe that few more tailwinds can drive MU price up to 20-30% before its next earnings (Sep 27), and 60-100% in 3-6 months depending on market sentiment.\n\nIts current price targets are: Yahoo avg 115.59, Seeking Alpha avg 111.76, Marketwatch avg 115.85,  \nTip Ranks: 112.64, Marketbeat: 112.07, CNN: 112.50. Total Average PT: 113.40.\n\nIt is simple, but actually not easy. Buy it now since it is turning to bullish, and sell the news before it actually tanks again. If the tapering is coming? Buy the PUTs or wait until the price became cheap again with healthy correction. And then we get in the ride again when it starts pumping again. I think that is how you can survive in this stupid unpredictable market. I sometimes use option straddle strategy during this unpredictable market because all you need to do is choosing high volatility stocks (I might use this strategy for MU later since it has a high volatility, and the current market is unpredictable).\n\nMy positions: 24 Sep 72c x 7 , 24 Sep 68c x 10, owning 100 shares.\n\nIndeed, this is just my DD, no financial advice.\n\nThank you guys.", "id": "pccqus", "created_utc": 1630025956.0, "score": 83, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 72, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|8|**First Seen In WSB**|3 months ago\n**Total Comments**|25|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/osbr7k/micron_will_eventually_rally_5080_upside_potential/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pcchyc/mu_the_most_undervalued_semi_stock_has_2030/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p2qjxz/my_second_micronmu_dd_with_its_great_entry_for/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pccn95/mu_the_most_undervalued_semi_stock_has_2030/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pccqus/mu_the_most_undervalued_semi_stock_has_2030/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o4qdcj/micron_dd_easiest_and_briefest_explanation_for/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/naev28/regional_health_properties_rhe_will_soar_tomorrow/) \n**Account Age**|4 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "For all you 2020/2021 fucks, MU was the meme stock Dejour around here for a long time 2018/2019.", "score": 86, "replies": [{"body": "The good ol' MU August 90C days.
