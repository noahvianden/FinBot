{"title": "Why are BONDS recommended as a SAFE investment, yet they also CRASHED during the 2020 Stock Market Crash?", "selftext": "The general consensus is that bonds are a safe investment, due to having a low correlation to stocks. However, in the 2020 market crash, bonds went down with stocks!\n\nI can vouch for this, since i had approx. 10% of my portfolio in a Global Aggregate Bond ETF which i chose due to it being an extremely diversified fund, that also paid a decent dividend of 2.2%. I figured the bond ETF woud have been ok in the crash, but when it went down with my stocks i was quite surprised. Admittedly, It may not have gone down quite as much as some stocks, but it still went down with them. Hardly a low correlation then...\n\nThat same bond etf i was invested in is now down 2.5% over the last 12 months. Zero capital gains for anyone invested in it. I guess you could say that it is indeed doing the opposite to what stocks are currently doing, i.e a low correlation then. But, if it also crashes hard like stocks do in a stock market crash, why do people recommend bonds for as hedge against crashes? \n\nThe only good thing about bonds from what i can see, is that they tend to pay decent dividends. But that's it.\n\nAm i missing something?
