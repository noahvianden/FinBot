Already thinking about investments and saving. That puts you ahead of probably 80+% of your peers \n\nAssuming you have a long term horizon, the companies you listed are all very strong and likely will do well, so folks aren’t going to say “sell GOOG and buy TSLA”\n\nAll I will say is save as much as you can. In the early years of building a portfolio, the vast majority of your balance increases will come from deposits. Not from investment gains. \n\nIf you have $1000 invested, it’s a lot easier to save another $1000 than it is to double your money in the stock market. \n\nBut you seem in great shape.

Grass that looks greener this week/month may not look so green next week/month. Many stocks (such as banks) are cyclical and tend to surge and pull back as conditions change. Chasing rotation is a trap. It’s better to smile and build when your positions aren’t running, because good positions will have their day again and you’ll be there to catch the full run when they go. \n\n2. Taxes eat gains. It’s more cost effective to rebalance by adding than it is to sell and reposition. You could think of the true cost of a stock you bought with money from selling out of a position as stock price + taxes owed from the sale. \n\n3. When you look at stocks for long term holds, think about where you believe they’ll be 5, 10, 20 years forward. That will be more important than how they moved this week. \n\n4.
