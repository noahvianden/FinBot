With WOT, there is no vacuum in the manifold. If WOT happens when you are at 70 MPH, the car (of course) starts accelerating.  The human response is typically WTF?  With brakes applied at 80 MPH, slowing the car to 70 MPH and then releasing the brakes.  The amount of energy absorbed from slowing the car from 80 to 70 MPH is 15 time the amount of energy from 10 mph to 0.  The typical driver will do this a couple times before panicking.  At this point all the stored vacuum for assist is gone, and the brakes have already started to heat up considerably.  So now it takes 10x the pedal force to slow the car, as there's no vacuum assist. If the driver at this point realized all this, and applied all the force they possibly could, they probably could overcome the WOT and bring the car to a halt.  unfortunately, not realizing that they need to apply ridiculous force to the brakes, they only apply normal full braking force.  As a result it's not enough to overcome WOT, and the brakes heat up even more.

When you buy a call, you're agreeing to pay the price of the contract x 100 every day until expiry, unless the company goes bankrupt.\n\nPut: Associate this with putting money in your account. It's the opposite of a call. When you buy a put, you're agreeing for the price of the contract x 100 to be deposited into your account every day until expiry unless the company goes bankrupt.\n\nTheta: A multiplier on how much money you will get by buying a contract. Contracts with really high theta are sought after as they multiply your money much more than a contact with low theta.\n\nDelta: How likely you will be to get a margin call. Contracts with high delta are bad because you have a very high risk of getting a margin call.\n\n\nIV: Think of this as getting an IV of cash right into your account (bloodstream).
