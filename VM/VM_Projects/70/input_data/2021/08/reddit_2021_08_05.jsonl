{"title": "AMD PUT DD (Sell the NEWS, Sell the GREED before it TANKSS)", "selftext": "We all know that AMD is a great company. Its last earning surprise and its great growth guidance led the price to go 30% up. Additional bullish news about MacPro is also boosting this price up with 4x higher volume.\n\nHowever, we all gotta know that we always need to \"sell the news\", and \"sell the greed\" in order to make profits(especially options) because realistically, institutions and big hands have better models, connections, business relationships, and platforms which bring the fastest and newest information to them so they can take their profits out faster than one another. Most stocks are already priced in when its bullish news comes out, and I think AMD would not be an exception.\n\nReasons:\n\n1. The price is already too high, Quarterly RSI:82, 40 P/E, (Remember, Nvidia is still strong enough to keep their #1 position for a while).\n2. 76% owned by institutions (most of us can't buy or sell faster than them. Too risky to fight with them. That is why \"sell the news\", and \"sell the greed\" became quotes for retail investors aka ants).\n3. The current market sentiment is not bullish enough. We all know that the whole market went up too much since the COVID due to low interest rate and stimulus checks. Institutions and big hands all perceive that there will be a huge correction before the end of this year, but they can't start a big sell off now because thankfully the Fed and retail investors are helping them to take little more profits before they eventually start selling off. Therefore, I think AMD's current price rise was high enough to be the peak before it drops.\n\n[sourced by \\\\\"forecasts.org\\\\\"](https://preview.redd.it/anekyswaykf71.png?width=1222&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e680a785d30f55216511aeee2fa0a035c548b55)\n\nAs you can see by this forecasts, S&P 500 index keeps decreasing from August 2021 to January 2022, and then bouncing back from February 2022. It is just a forecast, but if the Fed says they will actually start considering about tapering in next year or something, there will be a high chance that the market goes down like this forecast values.\n\n4. AMD needs a healthy correction before it goes up again. Every stock needs a correction in order to prevent its froth.\n\nI hope that Bulls do not hate me by this DD because I love AMD too!\n\nI used to kept my long position until yesterday and sold at $119 and bought some puts with a small amount.\n\nI just want to do both ways to maximize my profits though. Indeed, I am going to buy Calls again later when it dips.\n\nThis is not a financial advice, just a DD. Thank you guys :D\n\nBless all you investors aka ants!!!!!!!!
