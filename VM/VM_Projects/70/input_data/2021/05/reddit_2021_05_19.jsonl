{"title": "Weird DD, about space and aliens and how it will affect space stocks.", "selftext": "So the US government is supposed to release government files related to UFOs otherwise known as UAP in June 25. Now to some of you it may not be a big deal but the public may feel different about that. You see, these reports we’ve seen that the government has been releasing “confirming” is just the tip of the iceberg. Now you may not believe aliens are real and that’s fine that you’re that ignorant. We don’t judge. However, the US has been conducting recon missions observing these aerial phenomenons. They know they exist. They know they are here. They do not know their intentions or capabilities. Which is scary to think. \n\nSo how does this relate to stonks? How do you deal with a possible threat that has way better technology than you? You build and invest in better aerospace defensive technology. “Space Defense stocks” more or so space stocks “Trimble, Boeing, Lockheed, or even ETF stocks like ARKX” and others i can’t name off the top of my head. The point is, the public will feel as if we are vulnerable and in doing so the country will pour billions into aerospace defense and technology.\n\nNow I added a link to some compelling information. https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ufo-military-intelligence-60-minutes-2021-05-16/#app\n\nAnother note.
