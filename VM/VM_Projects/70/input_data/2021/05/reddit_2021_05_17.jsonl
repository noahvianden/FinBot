{"title": "Expected moves this week. SPY, HD, TGT, AMAT, TSLA, RIOT", "selftext": "**The Broader Markets**\n\nLast Week – SPY was down by about 4% at one point during the week but closed the week lower by only about 1.5% vs the 1% move options were pricing. The VIX closed at 18.80, but was high as 28 during the week\n\n**This Week – SPY** options are pricing a **1.5%** move (in either direction) for the upcoming week. That corresponds to about **$411** as a *bearish consensus* and **$423** as a *bullish consensus*.\n\n**Expected Moves for This Week** (via Options AI)\n\n* SPY **1.5%**\n* QQQ **1.9%**\n* IWM **2.5%**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**In the News**\n\nCryptos...

I'll be fascinated to see how it plays out. TSLA stock has benefitted more than any other big cap stock by merging those two audiences. But now that Elon is picking sides in crypto one would think it changes the dynamic of his cult. (I don't mean literal cult, but it's certainly a cult stock)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Earnings This Week**\n\nEarnings season continues with reports from box store retailers Walmart, Target and Home Depot, China stocks Baidu and JD as well as tech names Cisco and Applied Materials.

Those moves are based on the percentage increase/decrease required to break even on a straddle, buying and call and a put at the same strike price. Options are usually priced higher, or have higher “implied volatility” during the week of their earnings releases because there is a potential for very good or very bad news coming from their earnings reports which can send the price flying either way. It is preferred by more conservative options traders to sell a spread during this more volatile time because the premiums are “overpriced” and and the day after earnings the prices fall drastically, know as “IV Crush”. Because you sold the contract, you benefit from this decrease in inherent value. Directional plays require a good bit more knowledge on the fundamentals and performance of the company.
