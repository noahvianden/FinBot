Imagine you invest all that $10k at once and then suddenly next week some awful inflation news comes out. Now all your money is trapped at a bad basis and you have nothing left to offset it with. \n\nMy advice is once you find the assets you’re willing to go the distance with, only put a fraction of that 10k in. I’d say consider 3-5k to start and leave the rest as cash for a bit. Then take some time watching the market and seeing how your investments fair. If it goes well, you can gradually average up in careful quantity. But if things go poorly you can either average down or consider revising your picks without suffering as great a downside.

Who do you think is going to acquire them? Realistically, you have 3 potential buyers - Netflix, Apple, and Amazon. I do not think Time Warner/Discovery is going to buy them because they seem to be also trying to sell themselves and used a corporate structure that is pretty much designed for just that. They are too big for anyone else\n\nNetflix does not acquire content through acquisitions. They create their own. This has been their policy for a few years now.\n\nApple has a history of avoiding acquisitions. They are a 2Tn dollar company and the largest acquisition they made was only 3Bn dollars. In 2015, they had the chance to acquire Time Warner, which is a much larger and higher quality asset. They also had more than enough cash to do it. However, they walked away.\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/25/apple-2015-time-warner-bundling-negotiations-almost-led-to-acquisition.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/25/apple-2015-time-warner-bundling-negotiations-almost-led-to-acquisition.html)\n\nAmazon just acquired MGM studios for 8.5Bn. While I do think they are the most likely of the 3, they need time to digest MGM before making more acquisitions. Why would they not wait and see how their previous multibillion-dollar acquisition goes before making another? Also, you get big issues with antitrust.\n\n2) Their valuation is low as a multiple of earnings. However, I would recommend you take a closer look at where those earnings are coming from. Substantially all of their profit comes from linear TV, which is being phased out in favour of streaming. In other words, most of their profits are in a declining market. They will not last longer unless they can successful build a streaming platform, which is far for certain. Netflix deserves a higher P/E because they are the dominant company in a growing industry that is taking over from linear TV and companies like ViacomCBS, giving them faster growth and a brighter future. Discovery's multiples are all screwed up because of their deal with Time Warner. Neither are great comps. I think using ViacomCBS's own valuation metrics before Archegos is a better idea. The company seems fairly valued. I would not expect it to double or increase 5x.\n\n3) Be careful of sports. Unlike other content (movies, TV series, etc), they have almost no value after the live broadcast. The current deal requires them to pay billions to the NFL each year2033. In order to make more money off future super bowls, viacomCBS would need to enter a bidding war and win from competitors like Amazon, who are willing to lose billions on their video platforms for the next few years. In other words, the value of future super bowls is mostly going to be realized by the NFL and not ViacomCBS. In fact, I think there is a very good chance they could lose future super bowl broadcasts in a few years. Contrast that with the James Bond franchise. Past movies will continue to have some value and MGM is almost guaranteed to make money on the next sequel. Ever wonder why there are a thousand Fast and Furious movies?

Amazon has rights to NFL's thursday night football currently, but they were not actively seeking a partnership with the NFL. the way i saw this deal, the NFL set a price point that regular tv networks deemed too high purposely because they knew Amazon has the capital and wants to get their skin in the game or test the waters at least in addition to their marketing power.\n\none of the few leverages the traditional TV networks have are local team broadcasts. their infrastructure is already in place for this. this is where a lot of other streaming services lack. all the major sports networks that big streamers usually carry (NFL TV, NBA TV, MLB TV) blackout local games. while things like the super bowl are important to viewership, that is just icing on the cake to me. local viewership is just as important, especially when generational talent rolls around, for that consistent income. athletes nowadays are human billboards. coupled with talks that college athletes will be able to be paid/endorsed heating up. Patrick Mahomes, the next football prodigy in many people's eyes, has singlehandedly increased viewership/interest by leaps and bounds. traditional tv networks are able to show these guys more regularly with local viewership + just being able to show more national games in general rather than the once a week 1 match up thursday night football. CBS in particular also has a long list of sportscasters that have been around for decades and they can sway viewership also, albeit on a much smaller scale. your average sports fan is going to pick the service where we can see our teams more often rather than just the \"big games\". these people are loyal and will go where ever their team goes. CBS already includes local sports as a streaming option, not sure about the others.\n\nthis is territory where it gets tricky for big streamers because of the (for lack of a better term) \"cyclical\" nature of sports, both season and draw appeal of the athletes. unless big streamers acquired a traditional tv network or became a network themselves, they would likely have to work something out with their competitors. it'd be too much of a risk to ride only on the big games because the outcome of a sporting event can tank viewership/ratings in the blink of an eye as what it was with the most recent super bowl. i wouldn't put it passed a company like amazon to do this with the way they've been going, but it seems like a hill that may be too difficult to climb.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Seems like you know more than me on this.

It would take a break of 4160, but as you can see in the EquityHub view of SPX, gamma changes quite sharply down to 4055. We interpret this sharp gamma change as “volatility fuels” and therefore anticipate a fast move to 4055 if 4160 breaks.\n\n# TA Notes: Looking for low volatility today\n\n* Bulls need to break 420.73 for bullish 🎯\n* Bears need to break 417.75 for bearish 🎯\n* Support at SMMAs\n* Could see the 120 SMMA tested today so keep an eye if it doesn't hold.\n* If 420.73 breaks, look for bullish 🎯 : 422.43 - 423.81 - 425.15\n* If 417.25 breaks, look for bearish 🎯 : 416 - 415 - 414.13 - 412.74 - 411.26 - 410\n* Please not that if we push below 415 we could see downwards pressure to 405.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dbhgjlzsog171.png?width=3400&format=png&auto=webp&s=b028aa5f2ef4de95332e43361ae8eb60e24eb627\n\n# 15min.
