{"title": "This is my EV play. DD on BB, SONY, VW, Volvo.", "selftext": "Hey all - I am a huge auto enthusiast and been following the industry closely. This is how I’m betting on EVs.\n\nBB:\n60 $30c 01/2022 at $0.27\n🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀\n\n\nAlready powering many of the telematics of current cars, BB is poised to benefit from their established relationships with big automakers. Getting certified with an automaker is not easy, so it is a barrier to entry for other companies wanting in on the action. Security and reliability are top of mind for these companies. You don’t want your car to get hacked easily, so what better than a cybersecurity company that happens to also do EV software, and already has experience with ICE cars. I did a long DD here 4 months ago and still stand by it: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxknrl/bb_dd_9_reasons_why_bb_is_from_former_bb_employee/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\n\n\nSONY:\n100 shares at $101\n🚀🚀🚀\n\n\nI wouldn’t call this the Japanese equivalent for BB, as they aren’t a cybersecurity company. But Sony has a thriving consumer and B2B business that benefits greatly from consumer demand: the fact that they are literally selling every single PS5 they make is amazing and image sensors going out on many cell phones, including Apple using both image and lidar sensors from Sony. Great solid volume of sales to stabilize the company after some stagnant years.\n\nOn PS5, it’s actually a good thing that there’s a chip shortage. As Sony loses money on the hardware (and earn on game royalties and licenses), they are buying time to refine their manufacturing to lower costs, and lose less money on hardware sales. And because demand is so hot for the PS5, they are on track to build a bigger platform than even PS4 to charge 20-30% on every game they sell. That’s some fat margin.\n\nNow, you’re probably wondering…wtf, I’m here to read about EVs, why you telling me about PS5s? Yeah, you’re right but a conglomerate like Sony is multifaceted. While they build up their EV software platform, they have cash cows in imagery and video games. And if Apple is really building an EV, I would bet (am literally betting) that they would rely on currently trusted partners like Sony for their imaging needs. You sit inside an Apple car and camera recognizes who you are and where you’re sitting? Well that’s probably a Sony camera…or 20 of them. There will be so many cameras inside and outside of any Apple car. I mean…my iPhone 12 has 4 cameras, and it’s a tiny slab of glass and my family can’t sit inside and drive down the road with others in the environment.\n\nAnd when Japanese automakers get into EVs, they’ll look into a Japanese partnership. Guess who’s probably in pole position?\n\nFull disclosure, I also have 150 AAPL.\n\n\n\nVW:\n200 shares @ $33.32\n🚀🚀🚀🚀\n\nYou are all excited about Ford. I am too but I’m not buying into them because I think they are overhyped. But what’s interesting about Ford’s EV play is that they are partnering with VW to do so. That means…even if Ford can’t sell that many cars, VW will probably still benefit from joint research development and cost sharing. We also know how much more climate change is viewed as reality in Europe, and that’s VW’s home territory. VW already launching EVs under Audi, Porsche in the premium sector, VW, Skoda and Seat in the value sector, and Bentley and Lamborghini will likely have their ultra premium EVs soon.\n\nBut you might wonder…what about Tesla? They are so great! Well yeah they aren’t that bad. But VW is a goddamn monster. It’s kind of cute when Tesla announces a new plant, oh this is my 4th plant! We now have Shanghai and Fremont and building out Berlin and Austin. That’s cute. VW has 136 plants around the world. The economies of scale is insane and will be able to source materials for incredibly better deals. Oh and there’s that other partner called Ford who builds millions of cars a year also jumping into to beat on suppliers to give them both better pricing. Welcome to the big leagues, EVs.\n\nVW is likely to launching 5-10 EVs per year, the equivalent the full Tesla line up every year. And they have Electricfy America network (and Canada) and similar in Europe.\n\nAnd one more thing: VW also does trucks. Like 18 wheeler trucks. They are one of the biggest manufacturers, behind brands such as Man, Scania, and Navistar. And trucks have even more of a compelling business case for EVs…Will merge this part with Volvo.\n\n\nVolvo:\n800 shares @ $26\n🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀\n\n\nGoing to keep this briefer because this is already a novel. Now, when I say Volvo, I don’t mean Volvo Cars. That’s bought by Geely and yes they are making EVs under Volvo and Polestar brands. But I’m taking about AB Volvo, still out of Sweden, building trucks, mining equipment, backhoes, haul trucks and cranes.\n\nEVs are so more more compelling because of the use and mileage they get. It’s not uncommon for a one year old truck to have a million miles. And as cities around the world clamp down on urban center access (congestion or polluter fees common in Europe, and allow EVs in for discount or free), EVs increasingly make more sense. You save so much on lower op/maintenance costs, avoiding tolls and tax credits. Oil prices will be going back up so saving on fuel costs is the smart thing to do.\n\nAnother thing is, governments around the world are spending trillions on infrastructure stimulus. What do these trillions buy? Concrete, steel, Volvo construction equipment, labor. Where does the concrete, steel and other commodities (like rising gold and silver prices) come from? They get mined out of the ground with big Caterpillar, Liebherr and Volvo equipment. Yep, there’s Volvo again!\n\nSo if you believe stimulus is happening, Volvo is a good choice. If you believe inflation is real, Volvo is a good choice. If you believe EV is the future for hauling shorter distances and/or heavy loads, Volvo is a good choice.\n\nAll my opinions only, not financial advice.
