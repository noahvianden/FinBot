{"title": "Want to invest in biotech? A quick guide.", "selftext": "Short answer: don't. I work in the industry and learned early on not to touch it with a ten-foot pole. If you want to invest in the pharma/biopharma/biotech industry, investing in small-cap biotech stocks - MBIO, VKTX, ATOS, etc. for examples is basically gambling. Here are the alternatives I suggest.\n\nSupply chain. TMO and AVTR are the two biggest suppliers of consumables in the life sciences industry and essentially hold a duopoly. Both are basically trying to position themselves as the amazon of the industry. TMO is more diversified offering various services and high-powered equipment and is on the cutting-edge of R&D in a lot of equipment fields (MS and cryo-EM). AVTR owns VWR which is basically like an Amazon/costco hybrid for companies and academia. I highly recommend choosing one or both.\n\nEquipment. TMO/AVTR kind of fall into this category but I wanted to make a different section because they pretty much own the entire consumables market. Instrumentation has a lot more competition. While something like TMO has its hands dipped into everything, almost nobody would choose a TMO HPLC over Agilent (A) or Waters (WAT). PCR? Bio-Rad (BIO). Centrifuges? Beckman Coulter (DHR). A lot of companies have carved out niches for themselves whereas something like TMO is a generalist. You also have companies like DHR that hold brands like Beckman Coulter that have a lot of brand loyalty.\n\nServices. CROs like IQVIA, PPD, manufacturing services, instrumentation (calibration, maintenance) services etc. One of the most expensive things about the industry is the regulatory hurdles, especially clinical trials. CROs help companies save money on clinical trials by outsourcing them to companies already equipped to handle different parts of them. Equipment has to have records of being \"up to spec\" for audit purposes and a lot of companies do this stuff in-house or let the vendors send service techs out. You also have companies like TMO with their unity service that do this stuff. They also recently bought out Patheon and PPD so they're expanding the services side of their company a lot.\n\nTech. This sort of falls under equipment and services so I won't spend too long on it, but companies like Illumina have revolutionized things in their fields (DNA sequencing for Illumina).\n\nIn terms of innovation in tech/equipment, chromatography, mass spec, sequencing, cryo-EM and Big Data are the future.\n\nBig pharma/biopharma/biotech. You can still benefit from the excitement of a positive clinical trial result without the volatility. The issue with small-cap biotech is that you'll bleed out 70% over the course of a few months, and by the time you get that 25% bump from a positive trial result you're still extremely deep in the red. These companies completely hinge on a very small amount of drugs which is why they're such a gamble. Companies like PFE, ABBV have blockbuster drugs under their belt that keep them relatively stable and allow them to pay dividends. The 25% bump from a positive result you'd see from biotech is buffered to be more like 5-10%, but at least you know you won't (probably) lose 90% of your investment.\n\nLast but not least... ETFs. Pharma, biotech and medical devices ETFs all hold a lot of these aforementioned categories/companies.\n\nDisclaimer: I own TMO, A, AVTR and BIO.", "id": "nikw11", "created_utc": 1621696827.0, "score": 132, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 89, "comments": [{"body": "Welcome to r/stocks!\n\nFor stock recommendations please see our portfolio sticky, sort by hot, it's the first sticky, or see [past portfolio stickies here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+%22Rate+My+Portfolio%22+-+r%2FStocks+Quarterly+Thread&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all)\n\nFor beginner advice, brokerage info, book recommendations, even advanced topics and more, please read our [Wiki here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index)\n\nIf you're wondering **why a stock moved** a certain way, check out [Finviz](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=spy) which aggregates the most news for almost every stock, but also see [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/), and even [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/).\n\nAlso include *some* [due diligence](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/duediligence.asp) to this post or it may be removed if it's low effort.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

VWR and Fisher (owned by TMO) are the most commonly used catalog services for consumables, but that doesn't mean they make all of them.

Baker (owned by TMO and AVTR respectively), MilliporeSigma (Merck KGaA outside the US) is huge and there are a lot of smaller brands. For things like gloves and paper products, it's mostly KimTech (a Kimberly-Clark brand). For more specialized things there's always a variety of providers. Eppendorf is synonymous with microcentrifuge tubes. Cytiva (Danaher), MiliporeSigma, and BioRad are big providers of chromatography resins and Repligen has kind of cornered the market on prepacked columns. Filters vary based on types with the workhorse ones mostly provided by MilliporeSigma or Sartorius in my experience. I've mostly seen depth filters from 3M, viral filters from MilliporeSigma or Asahi Kasei, and TFF filters from Pall (also Danaher).  \n\nI'd also say that you're simplifying the equipment space, particularly downplaying how big Danaher is (especially since the Cytiva acquisition).
