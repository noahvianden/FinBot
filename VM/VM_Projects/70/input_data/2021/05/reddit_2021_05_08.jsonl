{"title": "High conviction stock/leaps list.", "selftext": "Figured I should share some after doing super deep analysis on a lot of these companies. I've written DD on some of these and will continue to write on them in depth.  My view on stocks is that you should pick and play on stocks that \n\nA) Care about reputation\n\nB) Deliver\n\nC) Contain economic consequences and economic challenges\n\nI'm extremely engaged by developing and improving my portfolio and I strongly believe that investors should go big and stay mentally tough through the good times and bad. In other words, the advice that I value most is by Charlie Munger:  \n\n\n>“If you’re not willing to react with equanimity to a market price decline of 50% two or three times a century you’re not fit to be a common shareholder and you deserve the mediocre result you’re going to get compared to the people who do have the temperament, who can be more philosophical about these market fluctuations.”\n\n I actually hate posting in r/stocks and r/investing because posts l feel that the culture in that forum is the opposite of this advice and seems to value cowardice more than conviction. I find it incredibly annoying and sheepish. \n\nThese are my picks, that I've researched obsessively and believe will result in substantial wealth building over time.\n\n# SUPER HIGH CONVICTION\n\nThese are companies that I believe have unmatched economic consequences and their existence fundamentally challenges their competitors to improve.\n\n1.PINTEREST (Search) **- The Idea Search Engine**\n\n2.
