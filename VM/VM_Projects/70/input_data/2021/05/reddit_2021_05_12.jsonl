(Brazilian variant) in preclinical models. These results demonstrate the potential of INOVIO's Pan-COVID-19 vaccine to induce cross-reactive immune responses against current and emerging viral variants as either a first-line vaccine, or potentially as a boost for individuals previously immunized with various Wuhan-matched vaccines.  \n\n\nDr. Laurent M. Humeau, INOVIO's Chief Scientific Officer, said, \"INOVIO is taking a dual-track approach in developing a COVID-19 vaccine because we recognize the need to support both pandemic and endemic considerations. In addition to our work on INO-4800, which we expect to enter a global Phase 3 trial this summer, we are also developing our next-generation Pan-COVID-19 variant vaccine, INO-4802, which is designed to protect against current and potentially future variants of concern. The study data we report today confirms our two-tiered development path is the best strategy for the short- and long-term fight against this virus.\"  \n\n\nFirst-generation COVID-19 vaccines were matched against the original Wuhan strain. These vaccines may have reduced efficacy against emerging COVID variants. In response, many of the next-generation vaccines under development are matched to a single variant currently circulating. INOVIO's Pan-COVID-19 vaccine approach is designed to provide cross-strain protection, immune coverage, reduced susceptibility to escape mutants, and non-restricted geographical use against both known and potentially unknown variants. Preclinical data with INO-4802 in multiple models revealed both broader and increased levels of neutralizing antibodies against a panel of variants than strain-matched vaccines. Building on this initial work, INOVIO plans to conduct Phase 1/2 clinical trials this year with INO-4802.  \n\n\nTo create INOVIO's Pan-COVID-19 vaccine candidate, variant sequences were identified over a four-month period starting in October 2020 from multiple geographic regions (Brazil, Canada, India, Italy, Japan, Nigeria, South Africa, United Kingdom, and the United States). Mutations in the spike sequences were aggregated for each region. The sequence results from these regions were then further engineered to determine a common set of overlapping mutations from emerging variations in the COVID spike protein sequences to generate INO-4802.  \n\n\nMore information from this pre-clinical study can be found in the paper entitled: \"Design and immunogenicity of a Pan-SARS-CoV-2 synthetic DNA vaccine,\" which has been published as a preprint in BioRxiv prior to peer review.", "id": "naprqd", "created_utc": 1620829106.0, "score": 75, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 76, "comments": [{"body": "My 2 cents: from what I've seen with J&J, Pfizer, and Moderna, vaccine development is priced in when its still rumor.

I'll repeat that so you slow fucking dunces can get it in your heads. Y'ALL BOUGHT SO MANY CALLS THAT IT IS NOW NEGATIVE GAMMA EXPOSED TO THE ORDER OF 1.5 MILLION SHARES PER POINT. \n\nThe issue being that with positive price days (like today) there had to be 27million shares purchased to hedge the options - but the liquidity isn't, and has never really, been there for this.(Also - if 27million shares had to be purchased just from gamma, how much of today was *really* investor confidence?). This caused volatility to rise. What happens when volatility rises? Oh the options have to be hedged again with 3.5million shares of selling. Thus any upside is hindered, and downside propagated.\n\nThat might explain why volatility has recently sky-rocketed (it is not normal to have \\~+10% vol in 3days, kids). Has it entered the doom-spiral? Hard to say. The only benefit is with decreases in volatility, approximately 3.5million options have to be hedged via  purchasing; this occurs lately when the price drops.

He talked about how steel prices kept going up everyday. He used the example that general motors has to keep paying more for steel everyday.

However this has now happened. It being so recent it has yet to really have a massive effect on steel trade. However as the last of many companies steel reserves go empty they are going to have to eventually purchase more from China. This will not only increase China's export profitability since many countries were trying to compete with China's steel prices they will no longer have to and be able to keep marking prices up as the super cycle continues through the year. No more price competition on steel will simply drive prices further through the roof since \"cheap steel\" no longer exists.\n\n**Steel demand continually on the rise while supply cannot keep up with demand.**\n\n[https://www.hellenicshippingnews.com/worldsteel-raises-2021-steel-demand](https://www.hellenicshippingnews.com/worldsteel-raises-2021-steel-demand-growth-forecast-to-5-8/) Another very recent article talking about how steel demand is affecting multiple sectors in the industry.
