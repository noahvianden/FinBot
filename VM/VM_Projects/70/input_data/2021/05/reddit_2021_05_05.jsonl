Why would you or me be able to beat the market? The answer is we probably won't and we are better off just investing in SPY (S&P 500 ETF). \n\nWe waste time (our most valuable resource) and money to individually pick stocks and in a lot of cases, we don't beat the index and sometimes lose money. \n\nOne of my favorite investors/teachers  Aswath Damodaran said something along this \"I pick stocks because I love the process of looking at companies and analyzing them and in the end if I lose money or do worse than the index, I am fine with that because I did something I loved\".\n\nI pick stocks because I love the process of trying to find \"undervalued\" stocks and learning more about industries and hoping to make money, but I also own an S&P 500 index. I am okay if I lose money because I knew the risks beforehand.

Money managers have performance carrots and sticks that require them to think short term.\n2. Most work for a fund that is restricted to a given strategy, even when that strategy is not the optimal one.\n3. Many simply have too much money and so many highly profitable but too-small-dollar opportunities are out of their reach.\n4. Money managers have to worry about an influx of money after a run of good performance, swelling their funds after the good money has already been made.\n5. Money managers have to worry about outflows of money after a negative event, being forced to sell at low prices and forfeit cash right when opportunities become plentiful.\n6. Money managers have to fear being caught in losing (or early) contrarian bets and looking foolish or stupid.\n\nSmall investors can invest in small-cap companies or other opportunities that are too tiny for institutions  to bother with.\n\nUranium miners are a good example of this. Their market cap is so small that for someone like a black rock to take even less that 0.1% of their positions in them, they would end up outright owning the company. And so they don’t bother - it’s not worth the amount of time for them, even if they do get back 500% gains.\n\nBuffett has spoken about the advantages  small investors benefit from, in that they’re nimble and can take significant positions and always find buys and sellers from the market makers without it affecting the stock price.\n\nGraham Greene before he passed away had spoken about how value investing is still possible once you look outside large-cap stocks - too little places to invest in for institutions makes large-cap the only way to go, and so you have a lot of sophisticated money looking at the same subset of stocks, hard for the individual investor to beat.\n\nI agree though, S&P 500 and other such indexes are great.

Only thing I would say about the last paragraph is that in fact, \"value\" investing is possible even in large cap stocks.

For example, holding AAPL since 2015 would have returned 414% vs 128% for the SP500 and arguably with not that much more risk.

But BNTX and MRNA have huge leads in manufacturing and clinical trials for the next generation and copycat vaccines aren't trivial... closer to biosimilar antibody therapy than generic small molecule drugs in complexity for approval. Rich countries will stick with what definitely works and is definitely safe in 2022-2023. Look at AZ/J&J concerns. If BNTX or MRNA doesn't have very solid progress beyond covid on that same timescale, they're already falling behind on the next couple generations of mRNA therapies which will be on the market very soon now that safety concerns have proven a billion times over to be much less bad than targeted diseases... Probably will need more work to reduce immune response for mRNA therapy you take regularly for protein replacement, gene therapy to knock down dominant negative gene products, etc. For possible 1/2 dose therapies things are going to go fast. I'd be interested to know how much spike is made by the vaccines and what tissues it's found in... targeted delivery of liposomes is pretty advanced, too.\n\nTo the extent IP is stopping copycat inactivated virus or adenovirus vaccines this means a bit more. But overall if investors are bailing because they were banking on covid revenue for many years imo that's a sign mRNA stock prices were undervaluing the future. All that said, the IP landscape is very muddy and it'll be a free for all between lots of players in addition to BNTX and MRNA. My money is on the people who won the first round, but they could easily be big footed by Pfizer or someone else.
