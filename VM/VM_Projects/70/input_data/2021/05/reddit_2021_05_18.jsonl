By using Amazon Prime to corral an ever-larger share of online shoppers, Amazon has left rival retailers and manufacturers with little choice but to become third- party sellers on its platform; in addition, half of all online searches begin with Amazon. In effect, Amazon is supplanting an open market with a privately controlled one, giving it the power to dictate the terms by which its competitors can operate, and to effectively levy a kind of tax on their revenue.\nAmazon leverages the interplay between the direct retail and platform sides of its business to maximize its dominance over suppliers. As Amazon extracts more fees from suppliers, it reduces their ability to invent and develop new products. Meanwhile, Amazon is rapidly expanding its own product lines, using the trove of data it gathers from its platform to understand its suppliers‚Äô industries and compete directly against them.

(WISH) investors with significant losses to submit your losses now. A securities class action is pending and certain investors who purchased shares in the company‚Äôs December 2020 IPO or on the open market may have valuable claims.\n\nClass Period: Dec. 13, 2020 ‚Äì May 12, 2021\nLead Plaintiff Deadline: July 16, 2021\nVisit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/WISH\nContact An Attorney Now: \tWISH@hbsslaw.com\n \t844-916-0895\nContextLogic Inc. (WISH) Securities Class Action:\n\nThe complaint alleges that ContextLogic‚Äôs IPO registration documents materially overstated the company‚Äôs business metrics and financial prospects. Specifically, the IPO registration documents touted ContextLogic‚Äôs exponential monthly active user (MAUs) growth, claiming its then108 million MAUs was a key driver of revenue growth.\n\nIn reality, by the time of its December 2020 IPO, ContextLogic‚Äôs MAUs had declined materially and the IPO registration documents failed to disclose this known trend reasonably likely to materially impact ContextLogic‚Äôs profitability.\n\nOn Mar. 8, 2021, Context reported disappointing 4Q 2020 and full year 2020 results, disclosing its MAUs had already ‚Äúdeclined 10% YoY during Q4 to 104 million.‚Äù\n\nThen, on May 12, 2021, ContextLogic (WISH) announced poor Q1 2021 results, including another 7% drop in MAUs to just 101 million, and the company slashed sales guidance for Q2 2021.\n\nThese disclosures caused the price of WISH shares to decline sharply.\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôre focused on investors‚Äô losses and proving ContextLogic (WISH) overstated MAUs and concealed known trends,‚Äù said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation.\n\nIf you are a ContextLogic (WISH) investor and have significant losses, or have knowledge that may assist the firm‚Äôs investigation, click here to discuss your legal rights with Hagens Berman.\n\nWhistleblowers: Persons with non-public information regarding ContextLogic (WISH) should consider their options to help in the investigation or take advantage of the SEC Whistleblower program.
