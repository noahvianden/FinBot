Meta is maneuvering and its been doing this for a decade now, they've bought up many of the major social communication platforms (e.g. Insta and Whatsapp) and bought Oculus and the technology behind it. Its rebranded and made a push for the metaverse and now it seems that this announcement has startled all the other tech companies into pushing for the Metaverse as well but Facebook was strategic about it and I think Microsoft has spotted this and realised that if the metaverse does become a reality, Meta will be a leader in it. \n\nAnd as depressing as it sounds, I think the metaverse will be a major thing in the future.
