{"title": "Puts on $LCID?", "selftext": "Hey guys! I just broke down some stuff on LCID to see how much growth is being priced in and if there is any money to be made. Firstly LCID is expecting to deliver only 500 vehicles this year and is still trading at a 90billion dollar valuation. If we take a very bullish estimate on the stock we can expect the company to deliver about 150,000 to 200,000 vehicles by 2025. If we also factor in a decent expense ratio of 80%( which is about 10% higher than Tesla) and give it a big P/E ratio of about 100x we see that in 2025 the share price comes out to anywhere from about $21- 45$. \n\nI used a spreadsheet for this data and priced in every thing I could\n\nSo should we buy Puts on $LCID.

It's very possible they are running shorts in the various forms (covered calls, puts, etc) against their own holdings to hedge themselves. \n\n**The only thing that stuck out to me here is BKNG**, which seems  overvalued, given it is trading at a price that is well above pre-pandemic levels and a P/E for this year over 55. Earnings are projected to grow at 130% next year.  That means the company would have about $100 per share in earnings. BKNG has traded very richly for some time, so applying a healthy 25X multiple on earnings, that would project a stock price of $2500 next year. In this market, a p/e of 25 looks pretty low, especially if the company continues to grow revenues quickly.\n\n**Sales for Q3 came in just under $4.7B**, which puts it on pace to exceed 2019 revenues of $15B in 2022 IF the trajectory continues. \n\nBKNG sold off big after its last earnings report, despite the fact they delivered a healthy beat of expectations. The drop is presumably because expectations had grown too high in advance of earnings, on concerns that COVID would impact travel, and on profit taking.  It's now down over 300 points from its high. \n\nIt's interesting to see the trend reversal that just occurred in the travel sector.

GPU and such is extremely hard to get for competitive pricing, even at distribution level (pallets full) quantity, with lead times well over a year out before they stopped taking orders.  Now they are indefinite.\n\nThe *real* problem though where there are few workarounds are things like power management controllers and that sort of shit.  Each server motherboard has probably dozens if not hundreds of them.  Not to mention every little device from a SSD to RAM chip to power supply.  Lots of little $.02 chips like that which are seeing 30+ week lead times and 10x the cost on top of it.  You get into the microcontroller range and you're seeing well over 12mo lead times for *extremely* common parts used in practically everything, with all remotely compatible alternatives sold out similarly.\n\nNo one really cares they can't get the latest and greatest CPU or GPU core these days, it's the supporting infrastructure that is continuing to fail.  Now we are moving into actual PCB shortages due to substrate manufacture issues.\n\nThe \"fun\" part of all this is that much of it was exceedingly predictable and talked about by engineers all the time for the past couple decades.
