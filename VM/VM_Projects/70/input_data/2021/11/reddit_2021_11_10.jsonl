In order to hold your shares and continue selling calls, you'll need to sell your calls at no less than 2.5% over the current price. At that level your premiums will be quite small for weekly sells. The issue is, you'll also miss out on the really good weeks. I honestly don't think it would ultimately do better than buying and holding SPY. It may or may not.  \n\nIf you are looking for larger gains than just the market, rather than buy SPY stock. Buy SPY LEAPS at delta of 80 or better. You can afford more exposure and hence more returns or more loss. \n\nFor example, I can buy a SPY options for next January at a delta of 86 for just under 15000, versus the 46000 for 100 shares of spy. Hence I can buy 3 options that represent ownership of about 265 shares for the cost of 100 shares. So, leverage of 260%.

{"title": "Rocket Lab ($RKLB), A Real Rocket to Hop Onto", "selftext": "There was a small amount of hype for this company last month, but I wanted to remind you in case you got distracted and forgot that this play is a thing, and they have earnings on the 15th. Isn't that exciting?\n\n[It has a rocket on its logo. Bullish](https://preview.redd.it/xwvfwuo4iny71.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7919da585ec69338f00f377f90a18db56919d8d)\n\nIll list some of my reasons for liking this rocket company.\n\n1. They have received the contract for NASA's first Artemis launch, as NASA begins building the necessary infrastructure for further Lunar missions. They will be putting a single cube sat into a highly technical, unique, lunar orbit launching in March of 2022. This is additionally important because it would be the first time their trademark Electron and accompanying Photon satellite bus would carry a payload to Lunar orbit. That's huge! But why? A lunar orbit has been done plenty of times before (*~~or has it?~~*), well, what if I told you the Electron rocket is one of the most cost affordable rockets available on the market at the moment. The successful launch of a NASA satellite into lunar orbit via an Electron and Photon configuration would open up lunar satellite launches to many different countries, organization's and even private citizens. Forget a lambo, I want my own moon satellite. \n2. The launch window for their next mission, *Love At First Insight,* opens on Thursday night, US time. This will be the first launch of a series of three for the same customer. With a proven track record of successful launches, I spy with my little eye no reason to believe this launch will be any different, except that it will be their first launch since IPO. Additionally, it will be their first live launch including ground experimentation with helicopter recovery.\n3. You read that right. Helicopter recovery. Let me clarify, that while they will not be recovering this booster by helicopter, they will be making a dry run at it, to investigate its possibility further, as they already have with static aerial drops. [Rocket Lab | Mid-Air Recovery Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3CWGDhkmbs) As they continue to develop this system, we could see potential that a booster could be recovered by helicopter, landed back on the launch pad to refuel and be inspected, have a new payload added and be launched again. Makes a lot more sense when you consider that Rocket Labs main launch site, the Mahia Launch Complex in New Zealand has potential for a very rapid launch cadence, and so does their Electron Rocket. \n4. Lets look at the bigger picture of what this company is. They're filling a niche market, providing solutions for launches that otherwise would not be economically feasible. They are *not* looking to be SpaceX's competition, although they could someday, if they wanted to, but at the moment, its simply not in their interest. Their Electron rockets are small, agile, and resusable, and can be tailored to almost any low earth orbit.\n5. They are currently in development of a larger rocket, Rocket Lab Neutron, which is expected to be operational by 2024 and will launch from the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport in Virginia.\n6. I want to mention again that this upcoming launch will be their first launch since IPO, considering that a month after IPO the stock price reached a ATH of $21.34 on Sep 9th, I see it having significant potential to bounce back to these numbers as they keep pushing out more and more news. \n\nFor these reasons, I now consider RKLB to be the best aerospace play of the year, and consider a price target of $25 feasible.

The ability to launch on demand and not be dependent on a main satellite. Most satellites do not need to go to an extremely niece and precise orbit. SSO with MVAC precision is good enough. We have already seen companies like Planet who had those needs switch to SpaceX rideshare as their main launcher.\n\nIf it Starship can't get precise enough insertion then that is where I think Rocket Lab will come in with Photon and the Kickstage.\n\nElectron will be most useful for things like constellation replenishment. Eg if OneWeb lost a satellite they could actually go to that specific location in that specific orbital plane. Photon and other space services will be the big moneymaker for Rocket Lab.\n\nI do own Rocket Lab specifically for that reason.

Musk [says](https://www.space.com/spacex-starship-flight-passenger-cost-elon-musk.html?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=dlvr.it) fuel costs per launch will be $900,000 and $1.1M to cover launch and recovery operations.\n\nBut the difference here is that Electron can't reuse its second stage. That's where the cost difference will be. They are not in the same league. Electron will hopefully become partially and rapidly reusable. Starship will be fully and rapidly reusable. Fuel costs just don't matter. Especially not when comparing a partly reusable vehicle to a fully reusable one.\n\nI think that Rocket Lab can get to full reuse in fact they are likely the only other launch company that can. But this will need to happen very quickly before everyone gets crushed by the boot of SpaceX and needs to go ask the markets for capital.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the beginning I agree. Operations cost will need thousands of Starships flying daily before it begins to seriously encroach Electron. (Imagine if there were only 10 aircraft that existed. Even if they were reusable the airport costs would be insane.)

In that sense, their Electron's mission space would not be entered by Spacex for the length of its intended operating period. That is why I don't see them as close competitors.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": ">Neutron\n\nNeutron is not fully reusable.
