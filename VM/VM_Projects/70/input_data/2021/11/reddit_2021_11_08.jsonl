This is pre-split, so when I bought them, their strike price was $1500 and $1600.  I bought 15 of the $300C @ $18.93/contract and 30 of the $320C calls @ $15.66/contract.  So in total, I spent $75378.77 in premium to buy those contracts.  Since that time, due to the stock price run-up, the value of the $300C is now $862.25/contract (4456% gain) and the $320C is now $842.35/contract (5278% gain).  In total, my calls are worth $3,820,425 if I just sell to close (assuming I get the current price and someone wants to buy them).  However, if I do this, I immediately pay ordinary income tax, which given the amount is the top (37%).  Instead, I can just buy the shares at the original contract price (1 contract = 100 shares).  So I would need to spend $1.4M to buy the 4500 shares which are worth $5.2M.  The gain is the same $3.8M as if I sold the contracts instead of buying the shares.  However, buying the shares at the contract price is NOT a tax event.  So I can hold those new shares for 1 year and sell them later as long term capital gains for 20% tax instead of the 37% which would be a big savings.  I don't have $1.4M sitting in cash right now, so I can either borrow that on margin (and pay interest on it), or sell some TSLA shares to buy it, or a combination of both.  \n\n\nWhen you brought up \"assignment\" that's only if I sold a call contract and collected the premium, which is NOT the case here.
