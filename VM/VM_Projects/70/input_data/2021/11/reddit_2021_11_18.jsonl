My thought is the incentive structure could be better not eliminated.  Why give 8k to households who make over 20k per month.... How about AGI be below 200 or 250k period and the incentive amount be something meaningful like 20k. I think something like that would have a larger impact in terms of BEV purchased (should be limited to BEV) and have a bigger impact on the so called lower middle class... Imagine a comfortable living household living comfortable with a BEV (Tesla preferred) vs a household choosing between comfortable living with ICE and less than comfortable with BEV.  Someone making over 20k per month AGI is more than comfortable unless they are choosing to live in Palo Alto or some such vs driving in the traffic... Nothing wrong with that choice but tax money should not be used to help someone stretch to live with the Jonses or walk to their tech job... I'm very okay with shifting from oil subsides to BEV and clean energy subsidies, I just think we could have the same amount of impact and benefit as this 8k but actually uplift and impact more people and improve air quality in a broader range of neighborhoods and states.... The 8k for a household making up to 250k or making up to 500k is not doing or getting the best and I'm just trying to say a celebration to me would be something better...

But my choice was long term savings and investment and maybe retirement at an early age.... I'd sooner invest 20k in Tesla then on a more expensive car at that past point and even today.  Some people just won't pay an amount for a car that is so close to the amount they could buy a house or homestead for... dreams and priorities right?  But, bring that price down to negligible difference between a new gas car and see what happens... Let's enable that much larger middle-class range to get into electric. The upper middle class, those who are not price sensitive at all and make over 20k per month, will buy when they are ready....

For example, give nothing over 250k and give 20k off for incomes below 250k, for example.

In other words, let's not apply trickle down economics from the 250-500k range.

Tesla is already producing as many cars as they can so they have nothing to gain (except a few more million which they really don't need at this point). Competition on the other hand will be able to actually make some money (most of them are losing money on each EV they sell).\n\nThird, we know incentives like this absolutely work. A couple of years ago when Teslas were about to lose access to the old incentive there was a massive push from everyone to get the car before the deadline and they were accepting cars with huge (mostly cosmetic) issues. Everyone likes free money and there are thousands of posts from those days proving you wrong.\n\nFourth, it doesn't matter who buys the car, a sold EV is a sold EV and that's all that matters to automakers.\n\nFifth, the demand for used cars isn't infinite. If 10 million people buy a brand new EV, 9 million of them will sell they old ICE so 9 million used cars will be available which causes prices of used cars to go down due to excess supply. Those low prices result in people either scrapping their rust bucket, instead of repairing it, or simply selling it and switching to a newer and better car (which pollutes less). And even though it's a very basic concept, you don't have to take my word for it, simply observe the current market were high demand for used cars causes their price to go up by a lot (even more expensive than new).\n\n------\n\nBecause it's obvious you don't understand what's going on (and I don't like using compound interest as an example again), think of it like this.\n\nScenario A.: All automakers start building EV factories but they don't produce any EVs, they just keep selling ICE vehicles. They keep doing that for the next 10 years and at that point they have built enough factories to produce 90 million EVs annually. Then they simply shut down all ICE factories and the next day all EV factories start producing the 90 million EVs which are the only vehicles anyone can buy. Congratulations! The transition to EVs has been completed!\n\nScenario B.: Automakers keep making ICE but at the same time they start building EV factories. When the factories are ready they start producing and selling EVs. People buy those EVs as they get built. Automakers keep building more and more EVs and people keep buying them as they become available. Years later the last ICE factory closes and at that point automakers only produce EVs.

Not sure how you ever test recovery of a rocket with a helicopter. Something goes wrong the pilot is now dead. I think they need to test it multiple times without a life on the line.\n2. Even if helicopter recovery works, there will be mess-ups now and then, resulting in extreme risk to the helicopter pilot's life. One thing that we accept risk to get people to space, but to risk lives to recover the booster seems insane.\n3. If the Starship program at SpaceX is a success then every rocket being flown today is obsolete. The cost to launch mass to space with a fully recoverable Starship, will be so little compared to current cost to launch that you might as well get the mothballs ready for everything else.\n\nBottom line, while investing in Rocket Lab may make money in the short-term, I would never  look to hold an investment in a company where their product is facing becoming obsolete within a couple of years.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Starship does not make electron obsolete. Starship is a massive rocket and demand will be quite high. A company looking to launch a small satellite to a dedicated orbit quickly may not be satisfied with the orbit and wait time a rideshare on a starship provide.

At a launch cost of $10 per kg, the scale and cost reductions here will completely and utterly make obsolete every other rocket, unless there is a specific technical need not met by the Starship (e.g. maybe safety concerns preclude launching humans from earth on them, so you use a different rocket to launch to LEO and from there transfer to a Starship for a journey further out). While demand may be very high, with enough rockets and reusability, it just won't make sense to pay thousands per kg to launch with others.", "score": -1, "replies": [{"body": "$10/kg ? Are you high? That's comparable to cargo ships. Even if it happens, it's not happening anytime soon.\n\nAs for technical needs not met by Starship - there are plenty. It's a big ship that throws out rideshare sats pretty much wherever so long as they're in orbit. That's fine for some customers and not fine for others.\n\nAnd then there's the obvious points of SpaceX competitors not wanting to launch with SpaceX and the fact that if SpaceX actually becomes a monopoly the government will be forced to break it up into several dozen companies.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, Rocket Lab isn't just a launcher even now and their future plans are focused on expanding towards other parts of the space industry. Basically, launch services are expected to become just a means for some of their other plans.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I just ran the numbers myself to see what the costs would be and came up with the following... These are estimates.\n\nThe Combined Liquid Oxygen is 3,735 metric tons and Methane 1,065 metric tons to launch 100 metric tons to LEO. Cost I can find for kg of Methane is $1.35 and Liq Oxygen is $0.10 per kg. Do the math and it comes to $1.8M in fuel, which per kg of cargo to space is $18.\n\nIf the methane and liq oxygen costs are less it can be cheaper, if more, then obviously greater.\n\nThose costs don't take into account the cost of the vehicle. The old target for the starship was $5M (I think) so add the booster and you get a cost of $10M. Assuming the costs are 4X that amount, it is $40M for the system. If you can reliably fly them each 20 times, that  would be  $2M cost per flight, so would bring the total cost to $40 per kg.\n\nPretty easy to see why reusability and large size is key to space. Current launch costs are well over $1,000 per kg (think Rocket Lap is about $17K per kg), so this is huge. If they were to charge $100 per kg, demand would be insane. You could suddenly envision launching 100X your prior mass. It changes the whole economics of making satellites. Instead of overspending to make super-reliable long-lived satellites since you can't afford to send more up, you can make cheaper ones that if it fails, well the cost to launching it was not significant in any case.

It is over the range cleared for launch, so no concerns about human safety for drone / RC operation. \n\n3:  If you have one or two satellites and 3 to 6 months could kill your market share, you would easily launch with the Electron over the cost savings of the Starship.   Many satellites can take months to putter to their destination orbit after a ride-share.  Being launched directly into your destination orbit can save 3 months and the schedulability of a dedicated Electron launch can save another 3 to 12 months. \n\nAdd to it the services Rocketlab is offering with respect to satellite components and busses, they are a one stop shop for customers who do not have the capability to do everything on their own. \n\nRocketlab won't hurt SpaceX's business much, but they have a sizable niche carved out that they will be able to be profitable and grow much larger than they are now.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Maybe you are right. I was just thinking about Elon's statement that they are planning on building 1,000 Starships. Yes, 1,000, and I think that is to start.
