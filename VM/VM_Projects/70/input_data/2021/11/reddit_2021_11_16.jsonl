Noticed that Disney is at a low for the year, and if you check out their Disney+ 2021 announcement for all their marvel and star wars shows already announced not to mention the marvel movies, the kids movies, all the fox IP's they they really haven't had a chance to do anything with yet...I think they can be a good competitor with Netflix.\n\nTheir release dates for shows and movies are very aggressive. Netflix puts out more total content, but they have had 12 years of streaming build up and that's all they do. But If you look at the marvel IP alone it's like one series or movie every single month which is pretty crazy if you think about it, what other IP can you watch all year round in a whole bunch of different varieties. It's pretty impressive, and it looks like they are trying to give star wars the same treatment. \n\nIdk, I think I like the stock but wanted to see what everyone else thought. I think they are going to become Netflix's closest competitor (and Hulu which is also majority owned by Disney). I just don't really know how all of the above information translates to stock gains.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}
