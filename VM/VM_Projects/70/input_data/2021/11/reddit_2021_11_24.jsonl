So many other  things for Tesla to focus on then to improve the Plaid which is pretty much the fastest EV you can get (other than the Rimac Nevara, which is pretty much unattainable). Personally, I would like to see the Roadster out first, which should be a great car to take to the track (I think they will have to drop the 600 mile range to keep the battery pack weight down so handling is not impacted by the weight as it is in the S Plaid) and should put out some amazing numbers.", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Pretty sure that like Porsche these are rebranded Brembo Carbon Ceramics (perhaps some OEM specific design elements/requirements).
