{"title": "My hopes for GME", "selftext": "Hi all, this is just my opinion, not advice, don't take it seriously. I like GameStop and am holding 26 shares purchased at an average price of $100, some bought at $21, some at $218.\n\nI think three things need to happen for $GME to go up üöÄüåë.\n\nFirst, the business has to show improvements. The most crucial factor to convince a üåàüêª that he/she should not be bearish is business' growth in customers, services, cash flow, profit, whatever else that can be counted as a good thing. There are many good things going for GME now in terms of new talent in the team, new consoles, all this hype, etc., so I look forward to seeing improvements that tear down the bear theory.\n\nSecond, obviously, shareholders need to hold the shares ü§öüíé‚úã and buy the dips. Moreover, I think community involvement can help: from visiting the store and buying some goodies from them, to sharing good experiences on social media, all the way to reaching out to the leadership of the company and telling them about what is bad and needs to improve (constructive feedback). Papa Cohen, if you read this, I want free shipping on orders above $25 please!\n\nThird, also obviously, the shorts covering their shorts should drive the price up. I strongly believe that this will not happen just because it hurts them in their vaginas. Remember Elon and how he had to invite (literally call out) the head of a fund that was shorting TSLA to visit the factories and see with his eyes that things are for real? Shorters stopped shorting TSLA when they and their clients stopped being üåàüêª about it, and not so much because they were bleeding money.\n\nTlDr: This fight can be about big money fighting many retards' small money. But big money's position will weaken when they see there are actually good reasons to be long on GME.", "id": "leffp6", "created_utc": 1612672573.0, "score": 23, "upvote_ratio": 0.6, "num_comments": 68, "comments": [{"body": "Sir, this is an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting.", "score": 35, "replies": [{"body": "Ouch", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "AA members are quitters.

But even when at peak Tesla, we still had posts about small pee pee AAPL gains, and loss porn because of the Mouse üêÅ\n\nI also threw money like y'all in GME and didn't close while ahead. I'm going to diamond hand this because frankly I don't have an exit strategy and with options, I somewhat broke even for stocks i bought. Now we can keep crying about money lost or try to make new money. There are lot of plays going on. What happened to my PLTR gang? Why are y'all so silent? Weed stocks are going up again, yet we ain't paying attention. BYND been shooting again, crossing some important levels. TSLA back to 850+. We had some crazy ass earnings reports from big tech, again no discussion. And it's not like people aren't posting, there are some posts but they're not getting any traction because we're literally stuck in this GME loop. \n\nSo i ask all of you, new and old gang, to take a break and think what's the way out?
