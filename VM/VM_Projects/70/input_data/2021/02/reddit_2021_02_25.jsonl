This impacts the discount factor in DCF.  Especially impacts high growth companies (i.e. companies that promise cash flows far in the future).  As rates increase, it exponentially decreases the PV of cash flows far in the future.\n\n2. Equity risk premium shrinks.  As bond yields increase, all else constant, the risk premium that you get paid for investing into risky assets (equities) shrinks.  Hence money moves into fixed income and out of equities ... Impacting all equities.\n\n3. Reflation.  The yield curve is steepening (and TIPS-TBond spread is widening).  This indicates strong inflation expectations.  More importantly, it's expected that inflation will be driven by demand/consumer spending.  As a result, it's becoming very plausible that companies beaten down by COVID will have a resurgence.  Money then flows from those high valuation/low earnings companies into the beaten down valuation/high expected earnings company. \n\nWhat it means:\n\n* Increased volatility \n\n* High value/low earnings company begin to lag rather than lead\n\n* SP 500 will likely be netural-ish or slightly bearish short-term (rotation rather then pull back)", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "This is a way simpler way to think about it.\n\nInvestors want to put their money somewhere.

If investors believe yields will rise in a rapid and uncontrollable fashion, they will likely start panic selling stocks.  If the yields rise gradually, the effect might not be noticed much especially if stocks proceed to have good earnings this year.  You should start tracking 10 year treasuries in your watch list if you aren't already.\n\n2) Some \"frothiness\" already in the stock market.  There has been a pretty big run up in speculative stocks which are not profitable and believed to be a growth story.  This may have gotten a bit out of hand so they are probably due for a correction.  I think there are many investors who are in these stocks trying to ride them while the party lasts but ready to pull the sell trigger quickly at the first sign of distress.  \n\n3) Inflation concerns.  This is being debated as far as whether it will occur and whether that is bad for the market.  Generally though, if there is high inflation it would tend to hurt growth stocks since they borrow a lot of money and thus would be paying higher interest rates making it more difficult for them to profit.  Large companies with large profits who depend less on borrowing would be better shielded from this.\n\nSo my view/hope is that this is more of a normal correction for the big companies but possibly a crash in the more speculative stocks.

When you want to value a company, you create a model that distills a business down to it's cash flows and you put in assumptions (like growth etc) to see what you estimate the future cash flows to be.\n\nNow once you have those future cash flows, you have to assess what their value is today. Put simply, If I promise to give you 100$ in 40 years, are you going to act like that is worth 100$ today? No. The rate at which you \"discount\" each years cash flows is called the \"discount rate\". If your discount rate is 10%, then $100 given to you in 1 year will only be valued at $90.90 in present days dollars. If the discount rate was only 5% that same $100 payment in 1 year is worth $95.24 in present day dollars. Now lets push it out 10 years. At a 5% discount rate, $100 10 years from now would be worth $61.39 in today's dollars. At a 10% discount rate, $100 10 years from now would be worth $38.55 in today's dollars.\n\nThe reason this is important is because the \"risk free rate\" (us treasury rates) is a component that goes into calculating the discount rate. The higher that treasury rates are, the higher the discount rate is, the lower your present value of those future cash flows will be.\n\nA lot of the hyped up tech companies don't have much in terms of cash flows today but they have enormous growth rates. With a low discount rate, that means even though they won't start generating large cashflows until say 10 years from now, there's not much of a discount being applied for things that far in the future.

I'm having trouble connecting the dots and walking through the logic. \n\nSo lets look at this conversation as a overly simplistic formula for . PV is present value (today's dollars). FV is future value (whatever the future cash flow is). d is your discount rate. And n is the amount of years in the future that cash flow happens at.\n\n    PV = FV / (1 + d)^n \n\nSo the reason treasury rates are important is because how you derive \"d\". I don't want to get into too big of a tangent because there's a lot more to it than this but, in a nutshell \"d\" is the weighted average between a company's \"cost of debt\" and \"cost of equity\". Ignoring debt (though it's affected too), the cost of equity formula is basically =\n\n    Risk free rate + (risk premium)*levered beta\n\nRisk premium is just a spread that investors expect the general equities market to perform over the risk free rate and levered beta can be thought of as correlation between the stock you're valuing and the broad market.\n\nThis formula is called the CAPM formula (capital asset pricing model) and basically the gold standard in finance for cost of equity. [Here's a good link that talks about rfr's relationship with cost of equity.](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/finance/risk-free-rate/)\n\nSo now to recap, as treasuries rise (the risk free interest rate) so does the discount rate which investors are valuing future cash flows (\"d\" in the first formula). As you increase the denominator in the very first formula, the PV number is going to shrink.\n\n> Also, what is the relationship between the treasury rate and the fed prime interest rate? I know the fed can change the prime rate whenever they want (and right now it's close to 0%). Are the fed also change the 10-year treasury rates whenever they want, or is the 10-year treasury rate dictated by market mechanics? \n\nGreat question. So the Fed doesn't actually set the \"prime rate\", you might be confusing that with something else.  The only interest rate they actually have authority to set is called the Overnight Bank Funding Rate or more simply, \"overnight rate\". In a nutshell, primary banks in the country are required to keep a certain amount of reserves in their account with the Fed. If you have excess reserves, they can be lent out on an unsecured basis to other primary financial institutions for an overnight period. Banks use this for too many things to start getting into but the important thing here is to think of this as the most risk free possible rate any entity could have for borrowing a dollar over night.\n\nThe reason this is the only direct interest rate the fed sets is because it is the end of the rope that has a domino effect on everything after it. The term \"yield curve\" refers to a basic graph where you form a curve between all the individual \"risk free\" interest rates starting with the overnight rate and going all the way out to the 30 year treasury rate.\n\nThere's a whole conversation here on what curve bootstrapping is but that's not worth getting into. The basic answer to your question about 10 year yields is that is the treasury yield determined by the secondary market traders who buy and sell treasury notes/bills/bonds. More people buying means the yield decreases. More people selling means the yield increases.\n\nThe reason behind why they buy and sell is a multitude but at the very least is influenced by their expectations on inflation and as a result of increased expected inflation, they expect the Fed to raise the overnight rate. Or if they expect deflation/lower inflation than previously expected, they may buy treasuries and expect the overnight rate to not rise as much (or possibly decrease).", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "The discount rate is also called the WACC weighted average cost of capital. \n\n\nBasically a firms cost of capital across its shares and debt.

{"title": "Rocket Mortgage Earnings, Massive Partnership announcement and Buyback. 41% Short interest!", "selftext": "RKT - Earnings tomorrow and short interest is now at 41%!\n\nRocket mortgage reports earnings tomorrow after the bell. Rocket is currently the largest mortgage brokerage platform (Fintech) in the industry.  They currently have about 9% of the space and are projecting 25% within 5 years. \n\nReports from the CEO teased that they are partnering with the largest financial institution. Rumor suggest Berkshire since they are the largest. Their partner ships with companies like Intuit have dramatically grown their revenues so I expect the ‚Äúlargest financial institution‚Äù to dramatically boost their forecasts. \n\nNov 2020 their announced a 1 billion dollar buyback option that lasts 2 years.  I‚Äôm not sure they will need to execute the buyback but this shows the board of directors they are serious about killing off this short fund.  \n\nOver the last 6 months this stock has been channel traded as hedge funds like BlackRock recently doubled their positions.  \n\nIt pattern trades 3-4 day spikes followed by 10-15 days declines with a solid support at $20. \n\nToday the short interest reported showed an increase to 41%.  With 5 days to cover.  This is insanely high.  \n\nLet me preface I‚Äôm not advocating a squeeze im just simply giving my opinion on above news will cause. I believe RKT was attacked by the same short funds shorting all meme stocks as this was the darling back when it IPO‚Äôd in here and got smacked down by shorts.  Back then short interest was at mid 20‚Äôs when it spiked to $35.  \n\nThe big complaint was that 10 year treasuries were rising and inflation will kill mortgage stocks.  Powell spoke today and said they would try to keep rates low around 2% for a long time. \n\nToday‚Äôs housing report showed a surprise of 4% new home purchases vs .9% projected.  This is a huge beat and only fuels suspicions that Rocket will have a massive quarter report. \n\nRocket has the best refinance / return customer of any company.  They have a 70% refinance rate because they track their customers logging In to their account.  The industry avg is 23%.  \n\nThe one downside is the 8% economic interest the A shares have.  If rocket grows their projected 25% market share then their value is somewhere around $40-$60 in my opinion.  If they maintain 10% market share then they shouldn‚Äôt be worth more than the $20 they have now.  Might be the reason a short hedge fund is piling on them to halt their growth.  Maybe a competitor.  Speculating so I digress. \n\nWhen looking at the chart.  Look at the strength at holding $20.  Is this a moon shot, probably not... However with the volatility happening in GME and AMC I believe any pressure put on RKT shorts will force them to cover while the market piles in because this is a damn good company being held down by a hedgie bastard.", "id": "lrzoey", "created_utc": 1614232933.0, "score": 194, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 71, "comments": [{"body": "Can‚Äôt think of anything with as much upside, with so little downside as rocket.", "score": 74, "replies": [{"body": "Google: Space Shuttle Challenger", "score": 24, "replies": []}, {"body": "Couldn‚Äôt agree more on the downside risk.
