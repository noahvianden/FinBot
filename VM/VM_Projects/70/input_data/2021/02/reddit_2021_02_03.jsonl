{"title": "Do the the skeptical claims about GME even make sense?", "selftext": "Alright, I'm not going to pretend that I have a deep understanding of finance, but some of the comments expressing skepticism about GME reek of pure bullshit. Here's some of the recent claims I've been seeing.\n\n**1. The shorts have covered!**\n\nThe poster usually cites the massive drop in SI as reported by S3. Something like \\~120% going into Friday, down to \\~51% going into Monday. So, from a basic supply & demand analysis, this doesn't add up. Volume was relatively low compared to Mo/Tues/Wed and the prior week, most likely due to heavy restrictions (or outright bans) on buying GME shares on brokerages who ran into liquidity issues. If it were true that the shorts closed a massive portion of their short positions‚Äîpurportedly \\~70%‚Äîon Friday, then we would've seen a massive hike in price because shorts would've been scrambling to buy, along with the few institutional/retail investors who weren't restricted from buying. This basically would've been the squeeze. But that's not what happened. The price did increase, yes, but it didn't massively spike, not to the degree that it would have had the shorts legitimately bought back shares *en masse,* as is being claimed.\n\n**2. Sure, but that just means that new shorts opened up at the top, that's why the price didn't spike to squeeze levels!**\n\nNo, this can't be correct. If enough new short positions were opened Friday to artificially suppress and \"hide\" the supposed *massive* covering of short positions, then the SI reported by S3 would not have gone down‚Äîat least, it would not have decreased from \\~120% to 51%. At this point, claims 1 and 2 aren't even compatible. They can't both be true at the same time. My guess is shorts have been \"averaging up\" their short positions the entire time in a rolling fashion. Everyone knows the price will crash after the squeeze happens, so it seems unlikely that shorts who were willing to risk bankruptcy over this would suddenly throw their hands up, cover most of their positions (even if it were possible in this short time period) and then not take out new positions at the height to recoup losses on the way down. It would seem more likely that the SI hasn't actually decreased much at all, much less over the past 4 trading days.\n\n**3. The shorts closed/are closing their positions this week! (Mo/Tues)**\n\nAgain, I don't see how this would work. How could shorts be closing *en masse* while the stock price is in free fall, like it has been the last two days? When shorts close their shorted shares, they buy the stock. So, if the claim is that they've been closing their earlier short positions this week, then shouldn't we realistically have seen an increase in price? Especially with Monday's low volume? At the very least, the price should've stabilized, not plummeted.\n\nIt seems literally impossible for a massive buy back of borrowed shares to have occurred over the past 4 trading days while SI supposedly plummeted **and** without the price spiking to infinity, especially when those days were relatively low in volume in comparison to the days leading up to them.  One or more of these claims has to be false, right?\n\nMaybe they did massively cover and new short positions were opened to suppress/crash the price simultaneously. In that case, SI should've stayed relatively stable or gone up, not crash from previous estimates.\n\nIf the SI really did crash, meaning shorts massively covered their outstanding positions, then price should've erupted.\n\nIf we just ignore the estimated SI entirely and assume that the shorts covered a while ago, and the spike at the AH last week was \"the squeeze.\" That doesn't make sense though because why would shorts have tried to exit by buying back shares at the height of international attention? Between the shorts buying mass amounts of shares to cover and the gigantic wave of new retail investors wanting to get in on the squeeze, the price would've exploded well beyond what was achieved because who the fuck would've been selling at that point? What seems more likely is that the AH was simply a result of the insane media coverage and bullish hype drawing in lots of new long investors, both retail and institutional.\n\nHopefully someone can explain what I'm missing because I feel like I'm going crazy reading all this skeptical shit when half of it contradicts the other half.  I realize there are legitimate concerns regarding GME moving forward, but it seems like much of the original squeeze thesis is still viable.

Reports coming out that short interest in GME has decreased dramatically. Also important to remember that most longs are also institutions, not retail traders.\n\nI think the logical conclusion here is quite obvious based on what we know.

All the laddering has to be the work of HFs being short, and volume shows that liquidity is just not there, no matter how much it drops. The only moment I saw a spike in volume this week was at upwards spikes, with sells trying to lower it fast.\n\nBut it is also telling that there is no buy volume either. To me it seems other HFs are lying in waiting for their moment to pounce, drive this up on a squeeze and leave the rival HFs in the dirt. I cannot make a lot of sense otherwise to the huge volume on way OTM calls for this Friday.\n\nThe other players that are eerily silent (sure they have some good reason) is GME management.

{"title": "GME brief recap. Why did you buy GME in the first place? Hope to see more DDs instead of cultposting. Love you guys üöÄ", "selftext": "TLDR: Brief recap - fundamentals are still fun, and may be getting better. Upgraded Ryan Chewy + Reggie Nintendo, MSFT deal with rev share, pc building kiosk 1.5 store, console cycle, e-commerce growth and pivot. Probably missed some. Now with free worldwide exposure.\n\nI am not trying to gatekeep whatever you guys want to post, but remember the time when people actually called GME stores to ask about pc kiosk (with recordings even)? Those type of posts are probably more useful if we want GME to moon. I think we all prefer the confirmation bias from more detailed fundamental DDs like those than posts about people holding the line. Maybe it's just me, but I would prefer people from all over the world knowing about how GME is a value play than a short squeeze play. Anyway, here's a brief recap on the 'fundamentals' to hopefully bring more fundamental DDs back.\n\n**Upgraded Ryan Chewy + Reggie Nintendo**\n\nI think we know who Ryan is. In short, Ryan grew Chewy by like, a lot, using little capital. Now Chewy competes against AMZN, etc. I don't have pets since I can't even take care of myself so I have not used Chewy, but an edge Chewy has against AMZN is apparently their customer service. All these growing Chewy means Ryan is now more experienced and has more connections than his Chewy days aka upgraded Ryan with bigger rockets.\n\nYou know who else is all about the customers? Reggie Nintendo. If you tards don't want to read, there are videos out there about Reggie and how his customer-oriented approach is pretty critical to Nintendo's success in freedom land. \n\nNote: I have seen some people saying how they did not really like GME in the past. Maybe Ryan + Reggie can change that.\n\n**Microsoft revenue sharing**\n\nGME will share revenue from all digital content: DLC, full games, microtransactions, xbox game pass, etc. This applies to both new and pre-owned systems. If someone bought the xbox at Walmart and then sold it to GME, GME would get a share of revenue on that system once it is resold. That's a pretty big deal itself, but here's a bigger implication: This is an incentive for GME to push MSFT systems. Will Sony, etc have a similar agreement with GME to mitigate this preferential treatment for xbox?\n\n**PC building kiosk**\n\nKnow microcenter? I don't, because there is not one store near me. But from other DDs, apparently to get high end pc stuffs you need to either buy them online or drive hours to a microcenter. With the spread of GME stores, it doesn't take much to see how much advantage they have. Older DDs have people literally asking GME employees about pc kiosk 1.5 store. Now imagine this:\n\n\\- All the used parts they could offer to people wanting to upgrade frequently\n\n\\- Ease of building a pc + all in one package. The thing about building a pc is you really need to make sure the parts are right for each other and right for you or risk getting ripped off. PC building kiosk means you don't have to know about ALL the specs to get a suitable pc. Combined with purchasing games, accessories, special deals for powerup members, collectibles, third party exclusives, etc all in one application or location for sYnErGy and you get üöÄ. Why go elsewhere when you can have everything in one place? Best part is you don't even need to build it yourself. Someone else can eat that thermal paste for you. Worry about bending a CPU pin? Not really your problem at the pc kiosk.\n\n\\-  Want further synergy? Logistical advantage with having a store near you and knowing what's popular. With the right data, they may really cut down on the waiting times for a buyer on popular parts if not outright branded as 'never out of stock'.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nGME's turnaround story has not changed. GME just got an added worldwide exposure. Is $500 a fair valuation based on fundamentals alone? Maybe not, but with the focus on digital growth, it wouldn't surprise me if GME gets a tech-like valuation. Like one of our favorite analysts once said, GME is a disruptive EV company after all. Anyway, I got lazy and left out lots of other good stuff. If you want more, just look into older DDs. The sources are in those, too.\n\nPosition GME @ $30+. Never sold.

I don't like the current stock manipulation and I think Wall Street made a bad decision.  Conspiracies aside what is good about GameStop?  Not to long ago you could see trending stories about how GameStop has the worst business model, customer support, and trade in prices.  I myself rarely bought anything from GameStop because it was never convenient.  It was like going to a car salesman which I now do online too. PC games for the most part were always sold online.  I remember as soon as consoles caught up to online downloads I never bought a physical game again.  GameStop's atmosphere always sucked and looked like a dated museum.  I much rather of gone into BestBuy or Target.  GameStop is also a pawn shop model with games and gimmick collector toys.  eBay & Amazon already dominate this used market.  People want to buy new things and the used market has been established for a long time.\n\nWhat is positive about GameStop?  The pre-order line waits and the memories having to wait for Halo or Gears of War.  That is an archaic thing that no one longer does.  Pre-orders can be placed from the comfort of a home and the download queued.\n\nGameStop recently hired a eCommerce CEO.  The only thing that can keep GameStop going at this point is consumer loyalty.  No one is buying from GameStop.  All of the GME shareholders do not buy games from GameStop and will not.  Shareholders are obsessed with hording money and making money.\n\nSo after Wall Street short sellers are beaten, I believe GME will become a worthless piece of trash.\n\nEdit: Also another note I think WSB will just become Wall Street after this.

{"title": "DD $GOEV / Canoo's potential AAPL Partnership with a side of short squeeze üöÄ", "selftext": "First I want to congratulate us on breaking 8 million degenerates. I have been posting on this sub for over 3 years back when we were at only a couple hundred thousand. This is my first DD write up and I‚Äôm a little retarded so please go easy on me. \n\nFor everyone who doesn‚Äôt want to read a wall of text there‚Äôs a **TL:DR** at the bottom.\n\n**Technical Setup:**\n\nCanoo has completed its SPAC merger and ticker change a little over a month ago going from HCAC to GOEV. Ever since the combination it has been piled into by shorts. The short position has grown exponentially from 99k shares to over 10 million as of the last update by NASDAQ. I subscribe to S3 Capital‚Äôs retail short algorithm which gives a more accurate current estimate of ~11 million shares short. New available shorts are nearly nonexistent and borrow rates are sky rocketing. If you haven‚Äôt been living under a rock the past couple of weeks you already know how well short squeezes can play out. \n\n[S3 short Info](https://imgur.com/RPVpzbu)\n\n[NASDAQ Short Info](https://imgur.com/LrjJJCD)\n\n[Share Borrow & Fees](https://imgur.com/esZFBfL)\n\n**Fundamental Setup:**\n\nGOEV has a ton of positive catalyst the shorts are overlooking and I believe this will lead to large losses on their side. For one, the EV revolution is here to stay as you can tell from the new administration. Biden plans to electrify the whole federal fleet (estimated 650k vehicles). GOEV  has the perfect mid sized commercial B2B purpose built vehicle which fits the build of many government vehicles. The Canoo purpose built vehicle can replace for example USPS mail trucks.\n\n[MPDV Purpose Built Vehicle](https://www.canoo.com/mpdv/) \n\nCanoo‚Äôs leadership are veterans in the automotive industry which is hard to say for some of the other SPAC *cough * NKLA. Canoo's co-founder and CEO Ulrich Kranz was CTO at EV carmaker Faraday Future and more importantly has over 30 years of management experience at BMW. He worked to reimagine the MINI brand, develop the company's first SUV, and the iProject (BMW i8 & i3). They also poached talent from Tesla; Sohel Merchant (vehicle architecture) Christoph Kuttner (vehicle trim), and Alexi Charbonneau (proprietary EV skateboard tech) just to name a few. \n\nThe real value here is their proprietary B2B skateboard platform for EVs. Allowing for any automaker to design and build their perfect sedan and just clip on to an already existing powertrain. Now AAPL is most likely going to sign an EV production contract with Hyundai/KIA (expected as soon as Feb 17th) confirmed last night by the  3.6 Billion investment. GOEV is already providing their platform to Hyundai/KIA. GOEV has already been validated by AAPL as in AAPL wanted to buy them out in 2020 so clearly they like their tech. And if you think that‚Äôs not enough to sell you on this theory then listen to this: In 2015, Apple almost used the BMW i3 as the basis for its Apple Car‚Ä¶ the two founders of Canoo were the top guys on the iProject. It doesn‚Äôt take a genius to connect these dots. \n\n[i3 article Link](https://www.silicon.co.uk/e-innovation/apple-bmw-i3-electric-car-173344/amp)\n \n**My position:**\n\nI am holding shares as well as options.

The new technology executive announcement is definitely very positive, but doesn‚Äôt have the same spark as an Elon tweet.\n\nI think, as many of my fellow bag holders are all hoping, that Ryan Cohen exercising his right to purchase 7% of GME will provide the spark we need to get back on track to the 400/500 and beyond range.\n\nSo, Ryan‚Äôs a smart guy.

I think GameStop is going to piggyback off of their latest executive hire announcement into this, and fully come out as a online/e-commerce transitioning company.\n\nI think that their competitor, EA sports, is going to amplify this need with their latest results .

The company noted that 62% of its new game sales for the quarter were digital, compared to 49% in last year's holiday period. \n\nDigital game sales create two problems for GameStop. One, they generally don't move through GameStop stores, with the exception of those driven by cards that the retailer sells. ‚Äú\n\nTLDR: 50% chance that GME has been quietly lurking and just waiting for the right time to announce with Ryan Cohen.
