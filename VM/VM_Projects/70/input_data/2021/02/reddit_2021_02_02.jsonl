{"title": "Been in on GME since it was $12 a share. Here's why I think today is a good buy opportunity", "selftext": "First of all I would like to explain my current position and how I've played this stock so far.\n\nAfter getting burned on call options in early december i decided to just go with shares. I doubled down after hearing the news that Cohen increased his stake to 13%. My average cost was $17. My price target was $75 so I cut my position in half there, and took some additional profits above $150. I'm still holding 5 shares though and I just bought more around $75.\n\n$75 is fair value before the media hype came. Now with all the enthusiasm around this company I can see $150 being a good value. And possibly higher than that when they report sky high earnings next month. \n\n\nAnyway, now that this thing is at down to earth levels, we can begin discussing the actual business, not just the share price. So here is a list of bullish factors that could push this thing up:\n\n1.) New consoles.\n\n\nGamestop wasn't supposed to still be alive by this point. The very fact they are still alive with a big retail footprint will ensure they at least stay alive for awhile. Also, there was speculation that the new consoles would not have disk drives, but the new Xbox will has a disk drive, and there are diskdrives on ps5s as well (although they also make a model without a disk drive)\n\n\n2.) Deal with Microsoft\n\n\nThe gist of the deal is that they will receive 5% of the revenue from sales on the Microsoft store on every Xbox sold by Gamestop. It's a gimmick by Microsoft to incentivize them to drum up more sales. The fact these consoles are flying off the shelves faster than they can be stocked means that the impact of the Microsoft deal will be as big as possible. It will be a great digital revenue stream for the company going forward. \n\n\n3.) Lockdowns turbo charging popularity of gaming. \n\n\nWith people stuck at home with nothing to do, more people are playing video games than ever before. And despite the rise in digital downloads, a lot of people still like to have a physical copy. \n\n\n4.) $800million cash on the books\n\nYou can see why most of the heavily shorted stocks on the market are shorted as much as they are. Usually these companies are ass deep in debt and on the verge of bankruptcy. This is not the case with Gamestop. They have $800million on the books and they already payed off a large chunk of their debt early. They could literally do stock buybacks and shorten the supply even further. In fact last ER when asked if they would do more buybacks the Ceo said \"it's not off the table.\"\n\n5.) $100million shelf offering\n\nNow I was pissed off about this at the time slightly because it caused my calls to go to hell but in hindsight this was a 4d chess move. They filed for a $100m shelf offering back in early December. This allows them to sell $100m worth of shares whenever they'd like. So since this little squeezeroo happened here, that's like a drop in the hat. It would probably barely move the stock. \n\nAnyway, they probably don't need to do this unless they are planning something big, but either way it gives them more finance options going forward. \n\n\n\n6.) Ryan Cohen\n\nRyan Cohen has upped his stake in Gamestop to over 13%. They reached an agreement, and now Ryan Cohen and several of the other former Chewy executives are on the board. Chewy, the company that Cohen cofounded, is an wildly successful online pet supply store that took on Amazon head to head and won. They got bought out by Petsmart and currently have a market cap of $42billion. \n\nIf Cohen and friends can turn the company around, there is a path to $1,000 a share being a fair value. I mean, we'll see what happens, but there is a path. \n\n\n7.) Media hype\n\nThis has to be the first time I can remember Gamestop actually getting some positive PR. The widespread media coverage is like a free $hundred million marketing campaign. A lot of people probably thought of Gamestop as the shitty company that gave you bad deals on games. But now the narrative has been reframed. I think a lot of people are seeing them as the underdog, the struggling company getting pissed and spat on by wallstreet billionaires.\n\nAnd to a lot of people Gamestop kind of represents more than just a \"next blockbuster.\" The hedgefunds tearing down gamestop is like them tearing down a piece of our childhood. I don't know about you, but I still love going and buying old games at gamestop once in awhile. Although certain things I don't have much of a choice on, I try to give them as much business as possible.\n\n\nEdit: \n\nAdditional factors to keep in mind:\n\n1.) At the end of 2018, the company bought back 37% of the existing shares on the market. I would have to do a deeper dive to see what the market cap has been over time. But essentially, $75 in todays shares is a drop in the hat. Sure it hasn't been this high since 2007, but there also wasn't a share shortage in 07. This is what makes the company such a unique play. I think it was around that time when u/deepfuckingvalue got involved. This is a big reason the shorts are having a hard time covering. \n\n\nEdit 2: \n\nüè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåàüêªü§°'s please fuck off with your FUD bullshit.

{"title": "GME - 5 important thoughts and questions to consider", "selftext": "**(1)** Do we know if there is a resource for which we can track hedge fund movements? I know that they are a dark cloud of secrecy but DFV (and others who first had this GME stock idea) were able figure out that Melvin Capital was the one who was short. Where did he (and others find this info)? Since then, the news and everyone else has mentioned Melvin Capital so many times that we are taking for granted how and where this information is tracked? Given how much manipulation hedge funds are taking part in, it would be a huge asset to see as much information as we can about their positions.\n\n**(2)** No one should make any decision on GME (or any stock) on emotions. Successful trades are the ones that are made based on on data.  That means we need accurate short data. What is the best resource for short data that is most accurate and most frequently updated?\n\n**(3)** According to the below short info websites, I am seeing that there are 61.78 million short interest. If this is accurate, then GME will at some point go into a short squeeze. Its just simply the data. If not today, then tomorrow. If not tomorrow, then the next day. I think the key would be a trigger which would overwhelm the suppression. An example of a trigger would be a positive earnings release or some new positive development in their strategic shift to e-commerce. If we have to wait, so be it. Why? Because we do not pay margin to wait. They pay margin daily for shorting. Remember that.\n\n[https://financhill.com/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today](https://financhill.com/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today)\n\n[https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=gme&submit=Short+Quote%E2%84%A2](https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=gme&submit=Short+Quote%E2%84%A2)\n\n**(4)** For those of you who participated in the Tesla short squeeze, are there any lessons learned that can be applied to GME? There were a ton of shorts on Tesla. But Tesla kept announcing new exciting things and churning out improving delivery/profit numbers. The shorts got squeezed. Did these hedge funds try to short ladder Tesla? I'd imagine that the amount of positive news overwhelmed attempts to suppress Tesla stock price? Maybe that is what will happen with GME? GME is not Tesla but it does have tremendous potential with Ryan Cohen and a potential move to e-commerce. I'm wondering if maybe we will trade flat like this with ups and down until we get some kind of positive news trigger and then it will initiate a larger squeeze and perhaps will happen over a long period of time? Tesla, for example, rose dramatically in 2020 but it was kind of spread out through the year. If so, then we just need to be patient.\n\n**(5)** I am seeing a lot of newbies ask very stupid questions. Please stop asking what the next GME is or what trade you should make or how high GME will get to or what price is a good price to buy at or what is an option. If you are asking these kinds of questions, then stock trading might not be for you. Why? Because you are not understanding what we do here at WSB. We don't give anyone instruction on what to do or what not to do. We discuss ideas, we discuss different options. There is an expectation that you come to WSB with basic knowledge. When you decide to do a trade or not do it, it is purely your decision. And then you live with the loss or gain. And please please use Google to learn the basics instead of coming here and asking what an option is.  I know mods are overly pressured right now in all they have to do with the extra members but perhaps we will need to consider banning people who ask these kinds of questions.", "id": "laj2rv", "created_utc": 1612226544.0, "score": 162, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 69, "comments": [{"body": "Sir, this is the unemployment line.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

But it also appears [major holders have been selling off](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/large-gamestop-shareholder-must-asset-management-sold-off-its-stake-2021-01-28) too.\n\n> They pay margin daily for shorting. Remember that.\n\nYou remember that within some weeks, new numbers on what the current short holdings of Melvin Capital and others are at this time will be out, and you won't be able to willfully ignore the idea that they're out already.\n\nEven if they were still in, the amount of misinformation here is crazy. The price was never going to go up to $60k or whatever. Yes, you can default on a short. No, the brokers _aren't_ liable for it. No, they _don't_ have to close their position by buying shares on the open market if their creditors are prepared to make a deal. It's a plain bizarre idea that their counterparts would demand them go into default just to have their stock back, even though they themselves wouldn't be able to sell that stock at anything near today's prices after the squeeze was over. \n\nNo, the holders who've lent shares to the short-sellers should apparently be retardedly strict in demanding to be paid back in the shares that were borrowed and nothing else, not even something of greater value. No, they _must_ act in the one way that makes money for those who've bought into this. Apparently \"the hedge funds\" will engage in market manipulation all day long to piss you guys off rather than exit their positions in a simple and straightforward way by dealing with their creditors off-market.\n\nBut I know I'm talking to deaf ears here. It's all \"that's FUD\" and \"fake news\" and conspiracies here and there. I don't care. DeepFuckingValue here beat the short-sellers and he deserves his money and credit for it. But there's gonna be a cruel irony when all the johnny-come-lately types jumping in this week in wild hopes of $1000, $10k or even $100k share prices, realize that they've been buying up shitty shares at wildly inflated prices, giving a payday to Wall Street's _long_ holders of SME that they could only have dreamt of a few months ago.\n\nAnyway: **The current amount of shorted shares is 57% of the float**. Even that may be a high number given that the float is probably larger now that some major holdings have been have sold off. Also, **most of those shorts are probably in the money**. You can hold all you want, feverishly repeating your affirmations that Melvin is still in, that they're desperate and spreading misinformation and all the other affirmations you need to believe you'll be rich soon.

This same message might actually apply to silver. I think it might actually be worth looking into brothers, this is a potentially good choice, that‚Äôs all I‚Äôm asking is for you to double check the situation of silver.\n\nApe together strong, long GME AMC.\n\nEdit: remember the message boys, the reason behind the trades, let us learn and expand our expertise on these specific set of requirements and logistics in the future.
