Unprecedented fiscal and monetary support in Washington also played a critical role in the market‚Äôs resilience, which will drive stocks higher in the long run, the bank said.\n\n‚ÄúWe believe that we are still in the early stages of a new bull market, transitioning from the ‚ÄòHope‚Äô phase to a longer ‚ÄòGrowth‚Äô phase as strong profit growth emerges,‚Äù said chief global equity strategist  Peter Oppenheimer said in a note.\n\n‚ÄúThe changing mix of policy support in this cycle also suggests a possible inflection point towards a more reflationary environment than we have seen since the financial crisis,‚Äù Oppenheimer added. ‚ÄúThis regime shift is likely to drive the bull market higher over coming months and also have important implications for market leadership.‚Äù\n\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/04/goldman-says-the-bull-market-is-still-in-the-early-stages-gives-six-trades-to-play-it.html?__source=iosappshare%7Ccom.apple.UIKit.activity.CopyToPasteboard", "id": "lcy74h", "created_utc": 1612495223.0, "score": 119, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 73, "comments": [{"body": "This makes me want to sell. in my experience goldman does not have their finger on the pulse", "score": 104, "replies": [{"body": "I hear you but Tom Lee believes the bull rally continues.
