{"title": "Correction to complete by end of March", "selftext": "For folks saying last week was a crash / correction. We barely lost 5% on the Nasdaq and SP was down about half that. That is not a correction. That’s normal course of selling. Correction is that 8-10% range and feels very likely to still come. \n\nThere are a lot of reasons for a correction.\n\n1) Interest rates rising is a legitimate concern and who knows where they really head from here\n\n2) Inflation is going to come. Economics 101, M2 money supply goes up, inflation goes up. Passing another $1T bill is going to make this even more apparent. Possible that Interest rates may be signaling. This could potentially be a much larger issue (reference Michael Burrys thesis on this, it makes a lot of sense)\n\n3) Valuations are crazy. This one is a bit weaker because of all the QE/low rates/stimulus I’d expect crazy valuations comparative to history. Still it makes noise. \n\n4) Institutional money is sitting on enormous long term gains from March of last year that they are going to trim and rotate into different names over time. Plus end of quarter is typically rebalancing time and you see an uptick in volatility. \n\nJust my two cents, more selling is coming but likely to return to regularly scheduled bull market after.\n\nEdit: Seeming as how this thesis went correctly so far. I will note that I plan on buying a good deal next week as I think we will retest highs before the end of May. When we retest I am going to half cash.", "id": "ltn9le", "created_utc": 1614429424.0, "score": 18, "upvote_ratio": 0.68, "num_comments": 77, "comments": [{"body": "I don't think that the full market is due a correction.
