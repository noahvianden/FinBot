{"title": "üò°THE SHORTS ARE HIDING IN AMDüò°", "selftext": "On Friday Robinhood went after WSB‚Äôs first love Suebae. \nUsers were limited to buy only ONE share of AMD after they announced a record quarter. Why??? \n\n&nbsp;\n\nLet‚Äôs see - AMD is heavily invested in by big funds. AMD announces a record quarter, the stock begins to sell off!? Many people on r/amd_stock theorise this is institutional money trying to liquidate cash and take profits after getting hit by GME. \n\nBut wait, AMD short interest just rose from [52m to 107m.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/l7uw06/short_interest_on_amd_has_doubled_from_52_million/ ) Up over 50% in 2 and a half weeks after the company grows 50% and produces record results..\n\n\n\nThen Robinhood adds AMD to the list of stocks you can only buy a limited amount of and limit it to ONE share. Wtf? \n\n\nAMD isn‚Äôt part of any of the massive shorting going on in the market and is a pretty stable company. So why would they do this? Oh right, because AMD is one of the most held stocks on RH and many young investors like the company on a consumer level. So while it‚Äôs at a discount they want to stop you buying in so their buddies with the short positions can load up and get their money back after getting wrecked by GME, AMC and other heavily shorted stocks. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening:**\n\nFunds with large positions in AMD are shorting the stock before selling off stock they previously held. This drops the price and they collect a nice bonus on the way out. \nThe short interest in the stock has increase drastically by over 50%, and of course between earnings and RH limiting trading we saw a number of hit piece articles with false information about AMD. But weirdly enough no one report on the leaks that [AMD are now powering Tesla‚Äôs in car game console/entertainment system.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/l749ia/patrick_schur_picture_confirms_tesla_uses_navi_23/) Last time there was even a rumour of AMD supplying Tesla the stock went vertical. \n \n\nI‚Äôm sure the OGs here remember the blatant manipulation that happened with this stock back in the days when it was $2-$20. People like Goldman would downgrade the stock, load up on stock and wait for it to rally, sell, and then downgrade again.\nThese guys are back using AMD as their personal money printer because they just got wrecked.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Oh, and you know who happens to own 2.1m shares in AMD? That‚Äôs right, [MELVIN CAPITAL.](https://fintel.io/so/us/amd)**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBut here‚Äôs one thing RH didn‚Äôt think about. \nXilinx is about to be acquired by AMD in an all stock deal, this means both stocks move in unison with each other. And more importantly, the daily average trade volume of Xilinx is only 3m compared to AMDs 45.15m\n\nThis means if a number of people decide they like Xilinx stock, AMD will follow far faster than if they decided to simply like AMD stock. And since there‚Äôs no limits on Xilinx people can currently like the stock as much as they want.\n\nSide note - If you *really* like Xilinx and hold until the deal is complete, you will be given 1.734 shares in AMD for every Xilinx share you own. If this deal happened right now at current prices, this means you would make around 10% on your investment compared to just holding the same amount in AMD.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Please note:** I am not a financial advisor, just some long term WSB member here to explain that if everyone jumped into Xilinx instead of AMD the shorts would get pretty screwed. They think they found a way to make their money back, it would be pretty nice if they didn‚Äôt. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**HOLD GME**\n\n**LIKE XILINX (if you want I‚Äôm not a financial advisor)**\n\n**DESTROY THE SHORTS**\n\n**FUCK ROBINHOOD**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAlso, shoutout to [Hothardware for being the only news website talking about this](https://hothardware.com/news/amd-robinhood-gamestop-gme-shorts-wallstreetbets\n). \nSomething is very wrong here and we need everyone to know it.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTL;DR; - GO READ IT, STOP BEING LAZY.
