(\"McDaniel\") in a report with an effective date of December 31, 2020 (the \"GTE McDaniel Reserves Report\") and an operational update.\n\nAll dollar amounts are in United States (\"U.S.\") dollars and all reserves and production volumes are on a working interest before royalties (\"WI\") basis. Production is expressed in barrels (\"bbl\") of oil per day (\"bopd\") or bbl of oil equivalent (\"boe\") per day (\"boepd\"), while reserves are expressed in bbl, boe or million boe (\"MMBOE\"), unless otherwise indicated. All reserves values, future net revenue and ancillary information contained in this press release have been prepared by McDaniel and calculated in compliance with Canadian National Instrument 51-101 ‚Äì Standards of Disclosure for Oil and Gas Activities (‚ÄúNI 51-101‚Äù) and the Canadian Oil and Gas Evaluation Handbook (\"COGEH\") and derived from the GTE McDaniel Reserves Report, unless otherwise expressly stated. The following reserves categories are discussed in this press release: Proved Developed Producing (\"PDP\"), Proved (\"1P\"), 1P plus Probable (\"2P\") and 2P plus Possible (\"3P\").\n\nCommenting on Gran Tierra's 2020 year-end reserves, operational update and future plans, Gary Guidry, President and Chief Executive Officer of Gran Tierra, said: ‚ÄúOur teams in Colombia, Ecuador and Canada rose to meet the many challenges of 2020 through their diligent management of COVID-19 safety protocols and sharp focus on maintaining and increasing the value of our assets. As a result, we are pleased to announce significant reserve additions in both the PDP and 1P categories, despite our large reductions in capital investment during 2020. This achievement demonstrates that the Company's core conventional oil assets continue to show positive waterflood responses and low base decline rates.\n\nThe advancement of our waterflooding efforts in the Acordionero, Costayaco and Moqueta oil fields has clearly allowed Gran Tierra to continue to convert Probable and Possible reserves into the Proved reserves categories. Even though we decided during 2020 to reduce capital spending, we believe the Company's excellent performance in terms of PDP and 1P reserves additions is a testament to the quality of our assets.\n\nWith our strategy, we believe Gran Tierra is well-positioned for the resumption of prudent growth in 2021 and strong potential free cash flow1 generation. We have already increased production approximately 24% from our third quarter 2020 average, which we believe reflects the strength of our Proved reserves. Our 2021 capital budget of $130 to $150 million is a balanced, returns-focused program which prioritizes free cash flow generation over the rate of development, exploration and production growth, with investment primarily directed to the Acordionero and Costayaco oil fields. With a keen focus on further strengthening our balance sheet, we plan to direct free cash flow to ongoing debt reduction in 2021 and beyond.\n\nDuring fourth quarter 2020, Gran Tierra resumed development activities throughout our portfolio, including the ongoing well workover operations and the restart of development drilling at Acordionero. We also restarted workover operations at Costayaco and look forward to a planned initiation of development drilling in that field during second quarter 2021. We forecast 2021 average production of 28,000 to 30,000 bopd for the Company.\n\nOur 2021 plans are fully aligned with Gran Tierra's \"Beyond Compliance Policy\" which focuses on our commitments to environmental, social and governance (\"ESG\") excellence. Gran Tierra looks for significant opportunities and benefits to the environment and communities by voluntarily and proactively taking steps to protect the environment and provide social benefits because it is the right thing to do. In 2020, we also had our best safety year in the history of the Company.\n\nWe believe that Gran Tierra successfully navigated the exceptional challenges of 2020 and are excited to return to an economically sound growth trajectory in 2021 and beyond, with a focus on free cash flow generation and debt reduction.\"\n\n\n-> During 2020, Gran Tierra achieved:\nMaterial PDP and 1P reserves additions, in particular at Acordionero, Costayaco and Moqueta, as a result of ongoing successful waterflooding operations\n\nPDP reserves replacement of 133% with PDP reserves additions of 11.0 MMBOE\n1P reserves replacement of 100% with 1P reserves additions of 8.3 MMBOE\n\nFinding and development costs (\"F&D\") including future development costs (\"FDC\") of $5.06/boe on a PDP basis and $2.65/boe on a 1P basis\nF&D recycle ratios including FDC of 3.5 times (PDP) and 6.7 times (1P)\n\nSignificant reserves additions at Acordionero: 7.1 MMBOE (PDP) and 2.6 MMBOE (1P)\nDespite a material reduction in the McDaniel's forecast oil price assumptions relative to one year ago (the average Brent oil price over the next 5 years in the GTE McDaniel Reserves Report is $54.04/bbl):\nGran Tierra's 2020 year-end 1P NPV10 after tax decreased only 21% compared to 2019 year-end\nThis performance was achieved in part due to large reductions in forecast operating costs based on the actual savings achieved by the Company in 2020\nAs of December 31, 2020, McDaniel estimates that Gran Tierra's total 1P undiscounted operating costs over the remaining life of the Company's fields are approximately 26% less than the McDaniel estimate as of December 31, 2019*\n\nAcordionero, Costayaco, Moqueta and Suroriente now represent 83% of Gran Tierra's 1P reserves and 78% of 2P reserves\n\nPDP reserves account for 55% of 1P reserves and 1P reserves account for 59% of 2P reserves, demonstrating the strength of the Company's reserves base and the potential future conversion of Probable reserves into 1P reserves and Proved Undeveloped reserves into PDP reserves\n\nGran Tierra's mature waterflood assets, Costayaco and Moqueta, continued to grow and deliver value, with total reserves additions of 3.8 MMBOE (PDP) and 5.5 MMBOE (1P)\n\nFDC are forecast to be $312 million for 1P reserves and $565 million for 2P reserves\nRealized a 39% increase in 2P reserve life index to 17 years and a 51% increase in 1P reserve life index to 10 years", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Why do you think AVGR should be trading higher than $4?", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Nailed it on the miners under $1.
