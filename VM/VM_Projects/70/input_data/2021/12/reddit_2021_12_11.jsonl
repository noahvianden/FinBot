Looking for a critique on my strategy", "selftext": "I've been doing this for about a year now. I've learned a ton. In that time I've put together a hodge podge of rules I stick to. I try to be systematic, and stick to them. I consider myself to be a moderately conservative investor, who takes some occasional more aggressive plays.\n\nAs it stands, on my theta gang trades, I've got about a 90% win rate. But, my ROI is between 4.5 and 6% annually, pretax. Better than a savings account, but not great. Not enough to justify not being in VTI, lol.\n\nI primarily sell CCs and CSPs, and do PMCCs.\n\nMy rules (most of them you guys would care about):\n\n* Try to avoid memes, focus on a sustainable return\n\n* Sell CCs after at least 2 green days.\n\n* Sell CSPs after at least 2 red days.\n\n* Target 30-45 DTE, but a little further out is ok if it's got better liquidity (55-60 have happened)\n\n* BTC under the following conditions: 21 days, 50% profit, if I hit more than 25% profit in less than 25% of the DTE when I purchase.\n\n* On short positions, target 15-30 delta\n\n* For PMCCs, on the long leg, I target a minimum of 85 Delta, one date shorter than the farthest available expiration date. For short leg, target 20 Delta.\n\n* Close ITM PMCCs by closing out the spread, do not execute.\n\n* IV is above HV by at least 10%\n\nMy most recent rule has been to only enter trades with at least 20% annualized return which doesn't seem to have impacted much. I may increase to 30 but I don't find a lot of trades that check that box.\n\nMy watch list (it's short, I know)\n\n* INTC\n* CMCSA\n* F\n* NOK (getting rid of this, not worth the capital)\n* MJ\n* XLF\n\n\nI feel like my strategy is working decently well given the win rate. The returns feel sustainable. I'm profitable.\n\nBut I feel like the returns could be much better. I know SP500 averages 11% per year, so I'm not close to beating it.\n\nFor the more experienced folks, what could I do better? Different tickers? Anything I could tweak?

There's a balance that needs to be struck between having a high enough win rate and being paid enough to take the risk. You've already achieved 90% win rates, so how often are you actually being close to getting tested? If it's rare that it even drifts closer to your strikes then it means you would have gone in tighter, gotten paid more, and still didn't face much risk of being ITM.\n\nA lot of people (especially here) seem to find selling straddles unsettling. I understand why, it's a trade that always has an ITM leg. But the reality is that in many instances, you're getting paid such a high amount that the P/L graph would exceed that of a strangle, a comparatively safer play. It may have greater swings (higher standard deviation of return) but if implied volatility overstates actual volatility then it's a play that makes a lot of sense. \n\n# What Your Current Strategy Actually Does\n\nThis is one that I harp on a lot. r/thetagang is, for better or worse, an echo chamber for \"the wheel.\" A fine strategy, but a misapplied one. \n\nThe Wheel isn't a capital efficient option strategy that guarantees better returns, hell, many will point out that it often back tests poorly. The Wheel is a way to use options to implement an investment thesis. That's it.\n\nIf you're looking for better returns you may need to expand past the wheel. Outside of my Roth I would never do a CSP. Why would I waste that much buying power when margin exists (especially if I had a 90% win rate)? Look into strangles as a next step and start considering high POP vertical spreads like credit spreads when you are directional.\n\n# Your Tickers\n\nIf you're achieving 4.5-6% returns it's likely because that's roughly what those tickers you mentioned are allowing you to do based on timing. I trade some of those and think they're fine, but they are a narrow group that wouldn't make my short list on things to trade very often. There are plenty of good instruments out there without ever touching a \"meme stock\", build some familiarity with other areas and add a few more tickers to trade.\n\n# Your Rules\n\nI actually like almost all of them. I don't use many of them, but I think you have a good framework to start. The green/red day bullets can go out the door. Look into IV Rank as an indicator. Basically a high IVR allows you to get paid for taking risk and is mean reverting so your trades can be placed at better times that get you paid more, keep your breakevens wider, and have vega and theta working for you together instead of just theta. \n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOverall I think you have a lot of good stuff here. At first glance my thoughts would be that you are trading too safe and that you should very patiently try moving in strikes slightly so you can see how your trades perform under a similar plan to what you're doing but while receiving a higher premium. \n\nThe other is that you're limiting yourself to a strategy that really doesn't do what a lot of people think it will. I'm sure there are a dozen people ready to comment how they return 50% annually with the wheel (good for you), but that just doesn't happen reliably. If it was that easy we'd have millionaire college dropouts too busy to browse reddit looking to share their simple secrets.

When you sell an option and someone else buys one, both of you should be getting a fair deal... meaning, no profit... or maybe a small profit for the put options seller, based on the risk variance premium. But even that is small, so you need to bring something extra to the table to expect a meaningful profit... or else a lot of leverage (which brings addition risks) to go after the risk premium. I know this is a lot easier said than done.\n\n-The book Positional Option Trading is a great jumping off point for thinking about finding edges, but it is not an easy text. Can you sell naked options, do you have futures permissions? And if you feel comfortable sharing: what kind of ballpark NLV are you working with?\n\nNice that you are taking a thoughtful approach to your trading.

Low risk, low return is OK with me while I am learning. The value of experience can't be shown on charts, but is stupendously important when making decisions.\n\nSince you have traded the same tickers for awhile, it might be worth your time to compare trade performance within your portfolio. XLF may perform differently options-wise than the others, even if the P/L is the same.\n\nSometimes you can get a hefty discount in buying power if you are long the stock. I am selling married puts (long stock, short put) on blue chips that I own, because I want more shares of these tickers but at a lower price. Getting a great price on a strong stock has a huge influence on gains. If the rare assignment comes, I will take assignment and be happy about it. I take my modest gains from leveraging stock that I own anyway and just buy more stock with it. Every time I buy stock my available leverage and buying power increase a bit. Getting some premium for doing this is pretty much all gravy, after tax.\n\nYou can also get a surprising amount of buying power by getting portfolio margin approval from your broker, if you have a low  six digit account and you can pass the (easy) test. The BP requirements for broad, large cap indices are very low indeed. The big, famous liquid indexes are expensive, and the BP requirements were too high to trade them before I changed to portfolio margin. NOTE clearly that more buying power does not reduce your risks. Leverage is a power tool, and must be managed with care. I recommend that everyone that can manage risk get approved for portfolio margin. You don't have to use it, and the regulations change every year.\n\nI took investing and trading very seriously from the first day, but now it's clearly a serious part of my plans for life. I am too old (55) to risk a serious drawdown and I play it very safe. This was obviously the best choice for me in the past year, with 25% returns on a very conservative portfolio.

Using Margin is when you'll start to experience the benefits of option trading. The main thing right now is getting comfortable with making the trades, and managing the trades.\n\nAnnualizing out individual trades can give really wild ranges on return. I tend to look at the average ROC on capital per trade and use my expected rate of capital turnover to get a better approximation of annual returns.\n\nIf you decide to switch to using RegT margin, a rule I would add would be to keep total margin requirements to around 30% of total capital. or 30% of Net Liquidity. You never borrow money on margin or pay margin. You just taking advantage of being granted margin to put up less capital per trade. this will allow you to put on slightly more trades with a minimal increase in risk. I'm saying minimal based on what you listed as what your trading.\n\nWe all compare to the S&P average return, why?

You need to achieve higher returns over passive, otherwise why do it? right?\n\nIf you haven't checked out TastyTrade, I'd advise you to take a look, especially on their research sections. You'll find a lot of studies on returns. Looking at SPY options the range you can expect on average is 3-5% per trade in a standard margin account. A lot of your ideas look like the tasty mechanics, so I'll just translate it into annualized expectations. So 3-5% expected returns on a trade. If I hold a trade an average of 21 days, then I should be able to turn it over 17 times. Since I'm only using a 1/3 of my capital at any point in time, then I adjust the 17 by dividing by 3. This get me down to about 5 time. So I'll turn my capital over about 5 times a year. This gives a 15-25% annualized return.\n\nThis year is an elevated year, so returns should be higher. SPY is at 27% YTD roughly. 93% win rate for me. My losers have been only 3.5 times bigger than my winners on average. My ROC is 8.25%, Turn over running at a 7 times rate. I'm looking at 50% annualized returns. Just keeping it basic. Not reaching for yeilds, not going off into meme's or STONKS.
