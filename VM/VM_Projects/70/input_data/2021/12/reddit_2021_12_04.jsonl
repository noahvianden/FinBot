Recently sold my google position.\n\nWhile the FAAGS are good  growth companies, not necessarily a good investment at these prices  if the government hike the tax rate, the top management will start dumping their positions. We have already seen some. Omicron although more virulent, may not be more lethal which may turn the Covid into regular flu. Interest rates end up going up from here from fed policy. While there is no crystal ball here, there is a case to build against the tech stocks. So I am thinking this is the right time to think about the stocks that can grow for the decades to come.  I am trying to look for companies that can grow when they potentially hit mass market. I am not worried about dilution as long as they meaningfully grow.", "id": "r8z56n", "created_utc": 1638651983.0, "score": 17, "upvote_ratio": 0.71, "num_comments": 75, "comments": [{"body": "Welcome to r/stocks!\n\nFor stock recommendations please see our portfolio sticky, sort by hot, it's the first sticky, or see [past portfolio stickies here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+%22Rate+My+Portfolio%22+-+r%2FStocks+Quarterly+Thread&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all)\n\nFor beginner advice, brokerage info, book recommendations, even advanced topics and more, please read our [Wiki here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index)\n\nIf you're wondering **why a stock moved** a certain way, check out [Finviz](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=spy) which aggregates the most news for almost every stock, but also see [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/), and even [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/).\n\nAlso include *some* [due diligence](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/duediligence.asp) to this post or it may be removed if it's low effort.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
