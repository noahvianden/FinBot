This is not a very popular opinion as you can see from the other comments.

They are targeting a customer base that is largely ignored by Tesla and other EV companies.\n2. They have contracts with the off-road race industry already, along with their own race circuit.\n3. They are making specialty vehicles for outdoor type people.\n4. Rivian is a more widely known name than many of the other non-Tesla EV companies.\n5. The Amazon contract is lucrative and does not mean that UPS, USPS, and FedEx will necessarily go with competitors.\n6. Comparing them to long time companies like Ford and GM is not really a fair comparison. Ford and GM aren't going anywhere, they are expanding on an already solid product line.\n\nRivian would definitely be a long-term investment. While I do not think it will expand as much as Tesla did, I do think it will grow a lot.
