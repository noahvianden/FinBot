My holdings though are 60% in 4 stocks, another 10% in a handful of other stocks, and the last 30% in broad market ETFs.  My most recent significant stock purchases were mall REITS and mortgage REITS when they were very badly beaten down, and in my opinion, very oversold in the first couple months after the pandemic start.   I have a short, less than 1 page investment policy statement, a basic 80/20 equity/fixed allocation and an 80/20 US/ex-US split in the equity portion.

At some point we will have a decade or two of low returns and things will revert back towards long term means.    I have no way to tell when that will happen, so I just coast along at my standard 80/20 asset allocation.  I have friends that pulled their money out of the overheated market in the run up to the dot com crash.   I did much better just letting things ride, gradually taking profits on the way up by rebalancing out of stocks into bonds to maintain my chosen asset allocation (70/30 equity/fixed at the time).

Buying into individual stocks (there are hundreds of worse ones you could be considering honestly) necessitates doing more than a cursory look at the company’s financials; knowing the competitive landscape and differentiators is really important. That’s why it’s better to invest in industries you know very well (or learn about), because then you’ll know better than most why a company may do better than a competitor, or that its real estate holdings are more valuable than may be reflected on their balance sheet, for instance.
