The biggest thing I learned was how to identify demand. And at the time everyone around me wanted iPhones and played call of duty or fifa games religiously.

It’s very profitable but it’s very distracting and it was causing me to miss living in the present day sometimes. At times I was absolutely to stingy and it probably cost me friendships with good people. \n\nMy financial advice to you is stick most of it in index funds and the rest in long term plays. Then focus on what you want to do with your life long term. Focus on finding something you love doing and chase it. \n\nCreate a monthly budget of your expenses and goals. Once you’re hitting those goals you’ll see how much you have available to spend for yourself and actually going out and living. I’m not talking about burning $200 on a night out at a shitty college club. But if you’re passing on movie nights with friends where y’all chip in $10-20 for food and drinks, you’re making a mistake. And trust me, I was making that mistake a lot. \n\nLife advice, don’t be afraid to be yourself. Start by finding people who you enjoy being around and genuinely like being around you. It’ll be a struggle at first but eventually you’ll find your crew. In college I was constantly hanging around people going out meeting friends. Post college I keep in touch with 10 people tops, but those are some great people and we do talk stocks/investment opportunities a lot. \n\nAnd on the point of missed opportunities, there is always another right around the corner.
