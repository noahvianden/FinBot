I just love semiconductors though, it’s hard for me to sell AMD rn. I loaded the semi boat last April. I scooped up AMD, NVDA, QRVO, TER, AMAT, AVGO, MRVL.

It is almost a completely different race.\n\nThe horse to bet on in that “race,” from how it looks so far, will be Intel. The government wants a US solution for semiconductors (again, not necessarily the best semiconductors), and Intel has been propping up fabs throughout the nation. There are plans to support it through infrastructure bills, though I’m not sure how it stands as of today. \n\nThat said, Intel’s new CEO expects that the turnaround for the company will be around 5 years from now—which, ironically, is around the time that most people expect China to invade Taiwan.
