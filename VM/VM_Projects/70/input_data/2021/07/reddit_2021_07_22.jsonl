The most common example I see is that whenever the underlying index drops 10% then gains 10% the next day, a leveraged portfolio would lose a lot more value compared to the underlying.\n\n\nUnderlying: 100 -> 90 -> 99 - 1% loss\n\n3x Leverage: 100 -> 70 -> 91 - 9% loss\n\nA 9% loss is not a 3x of 1% loss!\n\nA plot showing what it means in practice:\n\n[Volatility decay](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EivindAamodt/Stock-Market-Leverage-Backtests/main/volatility_decay.png)\n\nWhat is often forgotten, is that the daily resetting also helps and serves as protection in some cases. Let's take an example where the underlying drops 10% four days in a row:\n\nUnderlying: 100 -> 90 -> 81 -> 73 -> 65 - 35% loss\n\n3x Leverage: 100 -> 70 -> 49 -> 35 -> 24 - 76% loss\n\nA 76% loss is a lot less than 3x of 35% loss. If it did not reset daily, the leveraged portfolio would be wiped out as 35*3 = 105% loss!\n\nThe same is also true when the underlying increases multiple days in a row:\n\nUnderlying: 100 -> 110 -> 121 -> 133 -> 146 - 46% gain\n\n3x Leverage: 100 -> 130 -> 169 -> 220 -> 286 - 186% gain\n\nA 186% gain is a lot better than the expected 46*3 = 138% gain.\n\n# Backtests from 6months up to 40 years. 250 trading days = 1 year\n\n\n### 5k lump sum + 500/month DCA:\n\n### [Lots of data -
