Crash Victims Say It Kills.\"\n\nWhat a terrible headline. Like, all cars \"kill\" because everything gets in an accident sometimes, and those accidents have consequences. But it also seems like Tesla is probably right, AP does make their cars safer. It doesn't make them perfectly safe or completely foolproof, but it seems like it's better to have it on average than not?\n\nAlthough this particular crash was really a lot of errors by different people. I honestly would've expected AP to pick up that truck. It's really difficult to say what went wrong, it seems like lots of people are speculating, but it could just be a very unusual edge case, which is why drivers should pay attention, especially in situations like that.", "score": 13, "replies": []}, {"body": "Check out OPs account history", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "Wow.
