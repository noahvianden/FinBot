{"title": "$ASO - Strong Fundamental Story With A Nice Chart", "selftext": "Unlike my other analysis, I'll be briefly dabbling in the fundamental side for this one. I usually don't - because let's be honest - most stocks are running at high valuations (plus this is one of the only profitable companies I've seen on this subreddit).\n\nI find that strong fundamentals greatly increase the probability of bullish technical setups.\n\nI do not hold a position yet, but once this meets my technical entry point, I will be entering one.\n\n**(FUNDAMENTAL OVERVIEW)**\n\n* IPOd late last year\n* Lockup period expired in March\n* Company was founded in 1938 (this is NOT a growth play, this is a boomer stock value play)\n* Market Cap 3.39B\n* Enterprise Value 4.8B\n* Revenue 6.13B\n* Trailing P/E Ratio 6.95 vs Dow Jones 26.37 (Boomer Stock Index)\n* Price to Sales 0.56\n* Profit Margin 8.10% (Obviously this isn't fantastic - but it's closest competitor DKS has about the same margins)\n* Current Ratio 1.39\n* 96% Institutional Ownership\n* 27% Short % of Float \n\n[Source](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ASO/key-statistics/)\n\nObviously this isn't all the relevant information - but this isn't really a post on fundamentals, they just support the potential technical setup. The company is quite profitable, has a healthy amount of debt and is trading at some low multiples. Again, this is **not some short squeeze prophecy - or some crazy disruptor with promising new technology.** It's simply an undervalued company in an overvalued market.\n\nNow, let's take a look at the chart:\n\n[$ASO 1Y 1D](https://preview.redd.it/ru3ah3foesb71.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=06748be9adbe12bfaef8b6650b6e40bdf5152501)\n\n**(TEAL)**\n\nLong-term uptrend stemming from IPO to now. This is the best spot to buy - especially if it corresponds with some support zones. Right now it's sitting at **30.50 -** but it slopes up by **0.05** each day.\n\n**(RED)**\n\nPossible **bull flag.** As you can see - this thing has been vertical since the day it IPOd. A bull flag is a typical pattern to form before continuing a large uptrend. It allows a stock to broaden said uptrend and strengthen it by filling in low volume areas - which also allows players to do business at lower levels - confirming they do not need to be revisited.\n\nThe breakout point for this setup - and my preferred entry - would be **41.06** Monday. It slopes down by **0.12** each day. You want a daily close to confirm it.\n\nFrom here - the first major target would be this zone from **42.07 - 42.78 -** this is a key supply zone. If we break this - it will turn to important support going forward, to target **45.00.**\n\nThis setup in particular is invalid on a daily close below **34.93 -** this point slopes down by **0.12** each day as well.\n\n**(YELLOW)**\n\nThese are key levels on the chart. Some are presented as zones - or series of supports and/or resistance close together. When we are below a level, it is resistance. When we are above, it is support.\n\nKey supports/demand zones are as follows:\n\n1. **33.10 - 32.65**\n2. **29.71 - 28.39**\n3. **23.22**\n4. **20.26 - 19.44**\n5. **17.86**\n6. **15.44**\n7. **14.08**\n8. **12.02**\n\nKey resistance/supply zones are as follows:\n\n1. **36.49 - 37.02**\n2. **42.07 - 42.78**\n3. **45.00**\n4. **47.50**\n5. **50.00**\n\nIn the event the bull flag breaks down, I would also be okay opening a position in this **33.10 - 32.65** zone (and adding at any supports below it). In this situation I would probably sell some cash secured puts, or load shares and sell covered calls. **Remember, this is a slow mover boomer stock. Unless there is a technical breakout, I do not want to be in positions that decay over time.**\n\n**(CLOSING NOTES)**\n\nThe chart in itself is objectively healthy. Despite the fact that it's been going up with no major corrections for quite some time - each time the stock rises it consolidates for some time - filling volume in and building support for the future.\n\nEarnings is on **8/26** \\- so not so close I would need to take it into account quite yet. Prior to earnings I would probably cover all my shares with short calls, or if I'm in long options I'll size down and/or turn them to debit spreads.\n\n\\---\n\n*Keep in mind technical analysis is a road map, not a crystal ball. I'm providing the most high probability entries & exits - with the most favorable risk/reward ratios. I am not making an absolute prediction of future prices.*\n\n*Not Financial Advice*", "id": "om5ypi", "created_utc": 1626534301.0, "score": 53, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 72, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|30|**First Seen In WSB**|3 months ago\n**Total Comments**|330|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|6 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "The top execs and cfo have been offloading millions of dollars of shares,  any idea on that?", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "Actually I think it was the CFO and he said taxes.
