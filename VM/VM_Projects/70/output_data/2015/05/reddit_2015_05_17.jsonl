Sorry.  \n  \nWe all wish we had bought bitcoin at 50 cents each, regardless of what you feel about Cryptocurrency.  \n  \nSince then, a lot of copy/paste clones have hit the market.  Litecoin, Dogecoin, etc, etc.  \n  \nThey failed to offer anything new or compelling, and despite my love for Dogecoin, it was 100% novelty and hype that blew Doge up.  \n  \n**Well, there's something new now.**  \n  \nThis is a big deal, because for the first time since bitcoin was released, we have something elegant, simple, and powerful, *that notably improves on the bitcoin protocol and had a fair launch*.   \n  \nMonero (people are divided on whether the name is silly or likable) is a substantial improvement over bitcoin in terms of privacy and security.  It is *so much* better, that it is arguably the first true \"bitcoin 2\" contender.  \n  \nBut it's new, and has had a rocky birth.  There is a lot of risk, but because there is risk, there is also the potential for massive profit.  \n  \nMonero moved from 50 cents to about 62 cents each over the last few days.  I have gone nearly 100% Monero since learning about it, as I feel like it posesses the best speculatory profit potential in the entire world today.  \n  \n##but don't take my word for it.  \n  \nI'm a large holder, so you shouldn't trust me.  Please do your own research and understand that this is not without risk.  \n  \nYou can start by reading some of the technical blurbs over on /r/AmericanPegasus  but will then need to venture onto Google and bitcoin talk.  \n  \nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/AmericanPegasus/comments/35vees/im_getting_excited_about_monero_and_going_to_move/  \n  \nIf you don't know much about crypto, you're going to have to buy bitcoin first, and exchange it for Monero.  You can buy bitcoin easily with a bank account or credit card through companies like Circle and Coinbase, and then exchange that bitcoin for Monero on crypto exchanges like Poloniex.  \n  \nIs it a little convoluted?  Yeah?  \n  \nBut once it's easy, then everyone is doing it, right?  \n  \nIf you don't believe me, fine.  Simply sit on the sidelines as Monero explodes upward in value, similar to how bitcoin did at inception.  Then you can cuss me out and call me a \"lucky fuck\" or whatever else you want.  Fact is, you're sitting on the sidelines of one of the biggest crypto plays in history and no one gives a shit what you think.  \n  \nOr, if you are willing to take that risk (and don't let me fool you, there is a lot of risk here) then buy some Monero and get on the rocketship with me.  \n  \nLegendary investor and world-famous mathematician americanpegasus has done it again.  \n  \nIf my pitch sounds scammy, and alarm bells are going off in your head: good, stay away.  \n  \nIf it sounds too good to be true: good, stay away.  \n  \nIf you think that crypto is dumb and this bull market, inflation-laden, QE-pipe dream will last forever: good, **especially stay away**.  (you deserve to be poor)   \n  \nBut if you are willing to take a monster risk with potential insane, quadratitanic %-gains...

What we weren't told is that the serpent didn't come once, but seven times.  Each visit he befriended a Jewish woman.  Each time, he granted a wish.  Each wish changed the course of human history... among other things.*  \n  \nOur story begins in a municipal building in Camden County, North Carolina.  Five women happen to share a restroom on the third floor.  They are all having a bad day that will soon get worse.  \n\nKayla is interviewing for a job so she doesn't have to go back to stripping.  Dakota is an overworked single-mother, trying to battle the child support system.  Erin is here with her husband for couple's counselling.  Jessica is more worried about why her high-school crush isn't answering her texts.  And Oksana is going through a brutal divorce with the best attitude she can muster.  \n  \nLoud bangs ring out in the hallway.  \n  \n*Were those...* More bangs.  It's undeniable now.  \n  \nGunshots.  There's someone shooting outside.  \n  \nBefore the women can even react, the power goes out too.  Now, trapped in a dark restroom, they argue between sheltering in place or making a run for it.  \n  \nA voice interrupts their debate.  It gives precise instructions on what the women should do: leave the room, go down the hall to the left.  Something is *off* about the speaker, but it's the least of their worries.  \n  \nWhen they do open the door, they find a different hallway than the one they came in from.  It doesn't make sense.

There are specific safety instructions throughout the novel that **must** be followed precisely if you wish to enjoy a safe reading experience.  \n  \nThat being said, we also incorporate a lot of cryptographic themes and will incorporate bitcoin in ways that have never been attempted before in a book.  \n  \n-------------------  \n  \nIt will be self-published, as I am an unknown author and I think the non-standard format and material will work well with an internet audience.
