{"title": "SHORT $AAPL -- Apple \"Faces Risk Of Inventory Correction\": Three Channel Checks Confirm Deteriorating iPhone Sales", "selftext": "One week ago we reported something unpleasant for the world's largest company: China Daily had reported that Apple's key Taiwanese supplier, Pegatron, had halted hiring \"due to poor iPhone sales.\" Today, Credit Suisse confirms much of the cautions laid out previously in a note in which it says \"iPhone supply chain orders have weakened recently. In our view, the continued weak supply chain news could weigh on Apple shares for the next few weeks/quarters.\" \n\nAs a result of the change in sales expectations, the Swiss bank is lowering its CY16 EPS estimates by 6%, but since it doesn't want to get on Tim Cook's bad side, says that it continues to \"believe that with high retention rates, continued installed base growth, and the optionality of a smaller 4-inch iPhone, Apple remains an Outperform.\" \n\nIn other words, the current weakness, previewed here, is \"transitory\", or so CS hopes.\n\nHere are the details from Credit Suisse' note on Supply-chain cuts:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProduction cuts. Apple has lowered its component orders by as much as 10% according to our teams in Asia. The cuts seem to be driven by weak demand for the new iPhone 6s, as overall builds are now estimated to be below 80mn units for the December quarter and between 55-60mn units for the March quarter. We lower our CY16 units to 222mn from 242mn to reflect this and assume 235mn for 2017 (6% growth y/y).\n\n \n\nDownward revisions anticipated, but coming sooner and deeper. The downward revisions came in earlier (November 2015, versus December 2015) and deeper (by 10% versus earlier expectations by 5%) than anticipated. We believe the softer- than-expected demand could be due to (1) currency volatility, (2) the lack of attractive Apps supporting the new force touch function (which has been the key selling point of iPhone 6s), and (3) macro uncertainties.\n\n \n\nData points suggest a weaker 1Q16. Current data points suggest the production cuts are mostly in the December quarter. However, as the new smartphones have only been available in the market for one month, we believe 1Q16 cuts could be potentially more significant. As a result, we now expect the component supply chain to see a single-digit YoY decline in 4Q15, and ~20% YoY decline in 1Q16. The aggregate number of iPhone builds is now expected to be in the range of 55mn to 60mn in production in the first quarter of 2016.\n\n \n\nPegatron sets solid 4Q guidance. For assemblers, 4Q15 earnings appear solid based on guidance, but 1H16 may be at risk due to iPhone. iPhone component cuts could lead to 1H16 risks for assemblers. Apple may shift to greater 6s orders to Pegatron as Hon Hai is exclusive on the new 4\" model. We expect Pegatron to ship 22/18mn iPhones in 4Q15/1Q16 and 66mn/70mn in CY15/16.\n\n \n\nIs the supply chain a good read? It is worth remembering that Apple's supply chain is vast with an additional complication with the timing between Apple's sell-in and sell-through numbers. Additionally, what is important to note with these estimates is the strong correlation (R = 0.95) between production builds and reported sales, as shown in Exhibit 2 over time\n\n-------\nFull Story: http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-11-10/apple-cuts-component-orders-10-due-weak-iphone-6s-demand-credit-suisse\n", "id": "3vt52s", "created_utc": 1449507449.0, "score": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.77, "num_comments": 68, "comments": [{"body": "/u/shortAAPL is the only thing that needs to be posted here.
