I, too, am long Apple.\n\nI have to say, however, your write up reeks of a shallow, almost juvenile understanding of equity analysis.  Your only valuation is that Apple is undervalued currently, yet you don't think it's worth $200/share as suggested by Carl Icahn.  For arriving at this valuation, you simply point to trailing P/E ratios as being low.  What's more, you frequently support your arguments by suggesting that action to the contrary happens \"for no reason whatsoever.\"  You even go as far as saying that the 50% decline in Apple a few years ago occurred \"for ABSOLUTELY NO REASON\" and that there was \"basically nothing going on\".  Did you not know about the death of the visionary behind the company, Steve Jobs, that occurred less than a year before the beginning of your google finance chart, or do you just believe that the uncertainty investors held about the future of the company sans its founder and CEO was completely unfounded?\n\nWhat irks me most, however, is that the entire article is written as if you were a professional.  Your constant caution that you could \"lose 100%\" of your investment and that your trade is \"extremely risky\" reminds me of high schoolers telling middle schoolers \"hey, kids.  Don't try this at home.\"  You make it seem as if your analysis is both proprietary and extremely technical, when it's frankly neither.  In fact, all of the proper analysis you quote can be found by anyone searching the internet.  I can assure you, institutional investors have access to much more data.\n\nI wish you all the best, as we are in a similar boat, and I'm glad that you're this enthusiastic about Apple, but I have to say that anyone who has ever worked in finance will cringe upon reading some of the things you have said. $30k might be a big options bet for you, but it's chump change in the eyes of any professional options trader, or any HNW individual even.\n\n-Throwaway account", "score": 44, "replies": [{"body": "He suffers from two major basic trader follies:\n\n* The need to be right driven by ego and not what the market is saying.\n\n* No sensible risk management or position sizing for account size.", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "[Ouch.](http://i.lvme.me/8c4pq0x.jpg)", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "Are you the guy behind that wonderful blog?
