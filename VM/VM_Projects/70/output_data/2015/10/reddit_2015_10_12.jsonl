{"title": "I'll DD The 1st & 2nd Top Rated Ticker in This Thread", "selftext": "\nSo my [last DD post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/3oi3m5/ill_dd_your_ticker_for_the_next_hour_for_free/) was a huge [success](http://imgur.com/cn8acWf) but a flop at the same time. \n\nI was thinking 2, 3, 4 maybe 6 people at most would mosey on into the post and ask for some sincere assistance as to where they should allocate their hard earned portfolio funds; asking me to politely gather them information on a companym offer my professional advice, save them time and cure my boredom.  \n\n**Boy was I ever wrong**\n\n62 comments later, as /u/pcx99 pointed out. There's not enough time in the day to legitimately DD them all. Even if my broker already summarizes the Q10's nicely for me. Also, /u/pcx99 is a professional (10/10) and I'm more of an amateur/rookie (7/10), although I'm sure they'll both tidy up nicely. Anyways...\n\nFor the top 2 highest rated comments in this thread, I'll do a professional Due-Diligence for you and the rest of WSB; posting it in a whole new thread. \n\nRule: Every top-level comment MUST me a stock ticker formatted like: $AMD. \n\nSorry to everyone I let down. I never lie. I don't usually lie and I'll probably cry myself to sleep tonight thinking about all the people I've wronged. Or I'll take Ambien. Whatever. \n\nRequest away! \n\n_______________________\n\nThese two requests ***will*** happen. \n\nI deleted the last thread due to the continued requests and the mods position on the matter. \n\n__________________________\n\nThis thread is closed.
