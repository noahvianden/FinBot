{"title": "$AVXL ($AVXLD) DD \u2014 NASDAQ $5.80 \u2014 3Mo play (60-150%)", "selftext": "TL;DR: Good 3 month play, good long term investment as long as you watch their data closely.\n\n-\n\n**DISCLOSURE PLEASE READ ALL OF THIS** I have been in AVXL since the .70s.   I have made [obscene amounts of money](https://i.imgur.com/0LIFPEP.png) on this stock and expect to make even more obscene amounts.   **I AM NOT AN IMPARTIAL PARTY TO THIS STOCK**.   I am going to try and be objective and I am going to try and outlay all of the risks, but my position in this stock may blind me to some of the negatives **and especially price projections!**  Do your own DD and be extraordinarily critical of this one.   Please.\n\n-\n\n**INTRO**\n\n-\n\nAnavex has been a WSB regular for quite a while.  Even if you don\u2019t know what it does, you probably know it makes people some money now and again because we keep talking about it.  Unlike **MOST** WSB stocks (looking at you here BGMD and AMDA), this one actually doesn\u2019t have many bag holders, at least not for long.  It\u2019s been the target of at LEAST **THREE** pump and dumps with the latest dump starting the very day of this DD article.  Most stocks couldn\u2019t survive one pump and dump, but AVXL has thrived.  So what\u2019s the deal?   What is going on here?  And how in the hell did /r/wallstreetbets manage to pick a stock that actually has people buying the dips and selling the peaks?  Because that is totally not how things normally go here.\n\n-\n\n**THE COMPANY**\n\n-\n\nAnavavex life sciences started as a small photo processing company that quickly died and its incorporation was sold to some investors that used it to create its new biotech incarnation and they purchased the rights to a drug from a greek researcher to be their product.   This drug showed promise in addressing protein mis-folding (an identified cause of [Alzheimers, Depression, Epilepsy, Parkinson\u2019s, and ALS](http://www.anavex.com/about-us/target-indications/) ) After a few years of meandering and mismanagement a new CEO was brought in.  Christopher Missling is a German doctor and he quickly managed to secure financing and more importantly arrange for an expedited clinical trial process for Anavex\u2019s drug candidates.\n\n-\n\nI want to talk a little more about Dr. Missling because he not only turned the company around but he *communicates* with the shareholders and he is an activist in preserving shareholder value.  So a CEO can\u2019t come right out and say hey our clinical trials are doing FANTASTIC but he can certainly move a conference from September to July.   And he can certainly create [automatic purchases right up to the very edge of that conference](http://finance.yahoo.com/marketpulse/AVXL)    He can offset a necessary warrant conversion by following it up with a [patent announcement](http://www.anavex.com/?news=anavex-receives-notice-of-allowance-for-u-s-patent-application-related-to-anavex-2-73) that they probably had for a month or so, and a notice that the [Michael J Fox Foundation is funding one of your trials](http://www.anavex.com/?news=anavex-awarded-grant-from-the-michael-j-fox-foundation-for-parkinsons-research).\n\n-\n\nSo now we\u2019re coming up on our next set of data and Dr. Missling is a bit more constrained in what he can communicate since he can\u2019t buy shares without interfering with a buy out, merger, and maybe a partnership.   So this time we get a dreaded reverse split to list on NASDAQ and guess what \u2014 AVXL will be fully NASDAQ when that conference data is presented.  And why would we rush NASDAQ if the conference data was not good?   In his back-channel communication Dr. Missling is telling the faithful, \u201cwe\u2019re all good here, NASDAQ is going to make the stock go up quite a bit more on the conference data the we would OTC\u201d.   That\u2019s my reading.   Feel free to make your own decision.\n\n-\n\nThe point of all this back story on the CEO is that most company\u2019s we invest in we [gripe and complain and grouse about management](http://finance.yahoo.com/mb/BGMD/).  AVXL is different.  That\u2019s important.  It\u2019s actually VERY important.  Dr. Missling didn\u2019t have to buy those 1k lots, he already had millions and more in options, but he bought them to communicate with us and he\u2019s still communicating.\n\n**FINANCIALS**\n\n-\nAs of [June 30](http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1314052/000106299315004580/form10q.htm), AVXL had 7.9m in cash and 1.4m in liabilities but [in their sept 15 filing](http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1314052/000106299315005193/exhibit99-1.htm) they show $15m cash on hand and 1m in liabilities.  So since Sept 15 they\u2019ve converted some warrants and we\u2019re seeing that MJFF grant show up on the books. They burn around 500k a month but have some expenses in the summer that can push that burn to 1.4m. There are ***66,204,173 warrants** as of the last ER, all of them in the money (.75 or below)  and some have already been converted.   AVXL has an agreement with Lincoln Park to require them to purchase *UP TO* $10,000,000 in shares at whatever the current closing price is (as long as the current price is over .50) and to date AVXL has availed itself of $1.3m of that, minting  about 1.75m new shares added to the float.\n\nSo what does all of that tell us?   Well the POTENTIAL float of AVXL is 149m shares (or 37m after the RS) if every warrant is converted (Discounting Lincoln sales which there\u2019s no way to calculate).  AVXL is about to become a medium float stock, it\u2019s going to move faster on good news and fall harder on bad than it\u2019s previous bloated status.\n\n-\n\nThe expenses without income tell us that next year AVXL is probably going to dilute some.  But thanks to that Lincoln Park agreement they\u2019ll probably do it in a way that won\u2019t show up until the next ER (which nobody be me reads apparently).   The reverse split nd NASDAQ inflation after the conferences and final data presentation will also mean AVXL will have to issue fewer shares to get their money.  So sometime during this year\u2019s catalysts at the very height of the stock they may go to Lincoln Park and say \u201cWe\u2019d like our $8m please, here\u2019s 50 shares \u2014 Ha!  If only).   The January ER will show the float increased a million shares or so and their cash on hand increased $8m or so.  And nobody will really notice.\n\n-\n\nThe thing is, Lincoln Park financing aside, AVXL is not in a position to need to look for toxic financing or warrant offerings.  They are in a position to look for a partner to defray development costs of their drug pipeline.  They can also sell or license their drug to other companies to explore its use in its other indictions.   And yes, they can raise money by issuing more stock but if the price is high enough that would not impact its holders as severely as if it was still a .50c penny stock.  I\u2019m sugar coating dilution here and I realize it so yes, its going to happen, yes it will be bad, no I don\u2019t know how bad, but I expect some fund raising this year through Lincoln Park (with no real impact) and then maybe sometime near the middle of next year for more operational funds.  Again, unless they license or sell and indication, get a good partner deal, or get a few more grants.\n\n-\n\n**NASDAQ/Reverse Split NOTE**\n\n-\n\nBy the time you read this $AVXL will be in the process of doing a reverse 4:1 stock split which means if you owned 400 shares of AVXL at $1.00/share you will now own 100 shares of AVXL at $4.00 share.   This is necessary for the uplift to NASDAQ.  Reverse splits are generally bad.  Getting uplifted to NASDAQ is generally more good than a reverse split is bad.   NASDAQ will allow AVXL to be purchased on margin, will allow people to purchase AVXL without impacting their margins in other stocks (much), allows easier institutional investing any institutions and eventually put and call options.\n\n-\n\nFor the next 20 days AVXL will trade under the ticker symbol **AVXLD**, after 20 days when AVXL becomes officially a NASDAQ stock it will again trade under the symbol AVXL.\n\n-\n\nMy personal view is NASDAQ is a very, very good thing for AVXL even if some may view the reverse split as a negative.\n\n-\n\n**Catalysts**\n\n* Data presentation in Barcelona Spain November 7 for more patients in the p2a trial.  We pretty much know the data is going to be good.  So expect a run up to this ($8 a share trading range at the very least on the close of November 6).  Whether you want to hold through the conference presentation is your call.   If the data is good expect the stock to start moving into the $12-$25 range toward the end of the year.   Note that $25 would value the company at roughly a billion dollars, for a p2a company that may be time to be looking to hedge or divest.  But on a moderate float in the rush of final p2a data it may touch that number.\n\n* Final P2A presentation at the end of the year.   The [p2a trial is fully enrolled](http://www.anavex.com/?news=anavex-completes-patient-enrollment-for-phase-2a-alzheimers-trial-ahead-of-schedule) and we can expect final data before the end of the year and in q1 of January at the very latest.\n\n* Possible announcement of phase 1 clinical trials for Parkinson\u2019s which was funded back in August by the Michael J Fox foundation.\n\n* NASDAQ uplift \u2014 institutional funding can move in (on the smaller float!), people can buy AVXL without impacting their margin, people can buy AVXL ON margin, international traders can buy AVXL.  **ROBINHOOD USERS CAN BUY $AVXL \u2014 holy crap!**\n\n* REMOTE \u2014 Partnership agreement before the end of the year.\n\n* REMOTE -- license of indication to another drug company.\n\n* REMOTE - selling an indication to another drug company.\n\n* REMOTE - purchase of ANAVEX (No insider trades since July, but no reason to go through NASDAQ expense if they were in talks.).\n\n**Risks**\n\n* Warrant Dilution \u2014 thanks to /u/Simon_Inaki for pointing this out to me.   Those 66m warrants (some of which have already been converted to shares) are **all** in the money and they will be joining the stock pool.   We should end up eventually with a 37-40m (after split) share pool but that\u2019s 40% more hands claiming the pie so your overall value as you hold this stock will go down either actually down in price or expressed as slower growth.  **THIS IS A SUBSTANTIAL IMMEDIATE AND LONG TERM RISK**  (Note this may be somewhat offset by new institutional holding available on NASDAQ)\n\n* **ADDITIONAL WARRANT RISKS** (Again thanks to /u/Simon_Inaki) The devil is in the details and the financing companies that buy warrants are the devil and the retail shareholder\u2019s enemy.   There may be clauses and covenants in these warrants that trip on reverse spits, and other factors that are **extremely unfavorable to shareholders**.   I intend to write up another DD on AVXL\u2019s warrants this week but be aware that these risks are presently **unknown**.\n\n* Operational Dilution.  There will be dilution to keep the company running and fund trials and new trials until revenues come in.  Invisible dilution in december that nobody should really notice.  Probably some about the middle of next year unless they can secure partnership or licensing agreements.  The dilution will be less harsh and severe than it would have been if AVXL was still a penny stock trading under a buck.\n\n* The data starts turning sour.   If their measurable success rates start getting questioned or fall below 75% improvement, look to hedge.  If people start dying, look to exit :)\n\n* [Patent Issues](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CB4QFjAAahUKEwjR6abJlq_IAhUEjA0KHYJnBGg&url=http%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Farticle%2F3354415-interview-with-dr-christopher-missling-ceo-of-anavex&usg=AFQjCNEfGBzndIq5mjvyXKe_4dy6lLdfaA) Note that Anavex has a board member who specifically specializes in patent issues.  However the inventor of Anavex\u2019s drug has not formally signed over the rights to the drug to my knowledge.  However Anavex has publicly stated they do not see this as an issue, it is not a concern and the US has already issued and assigned the patent to them.  But be aware of this risk.\n\n* Promissory notes issue with the previous CEO and board that AVXL considers illegal and intends to dispute and fight.\n\n* Biotech (LABD).  The sector goes down so will AVXL.  On OTC AVXL was rather insulated from market trends \u2014 it had its own weather so to speak.\n\n* AVXL has been the target of three pump and dumps (none of which change the underlying fundamentals of the stock).  I believe the risk of a pump and dump after the reverse split on NASDAQ will be substantially reduced but do be aware that it remains a possibility.\n\n* Note that in the past under the old board and CEO AVXL used stock promotion services.   To my knowledge it has not engaged in this under the new management and nothing shows up in their 10q\u2019s to indicate that the company has engaged in this practice under the new management.\n\n* it\u2019s going to have its own [StockTwits](http://stocktwits.com/symbol/avxl) board in a few days and if you invest you ARE going to be visiting it \u2014 quit kidding yourself.\n\n-\n\n**RESOURCES**\n\n-\n\nI highly recommend you visit the [iHub](http://investorshub.advfn.com/Anavex-Life-Sciences-Corp-AVXL-11474/) site first and read the top 4 stacked posts which contain other compiled information and DD (Note that JBEM did the ORIGINAL DD on this stock and called it in the .40s).\n\n-\n\n* [Latest 10-q](http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1314052/000106299315004580/form10q.htm)\n* [Yearly Balance Sheet](http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1314052/000106299315005193/exhibit99-1.htm)\n* [Yahoo](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=avxl)\n\n-\n\n**DISCLOSURE**\n\n-\n\nSee the disclosure at the top of the document.
