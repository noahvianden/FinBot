MASSIVE for the company, Revenue rose by a shitload, EPS not great. So they fixed their products, people are now ACTUALLY considering AMD as a good CPU and GPU maker. Up 100% after this Earnings\n\n* Time passes, more audacious projects that pay off, start barging in on Markets that they were never part at. **mid 2016**\n\nNext earnings after more products roll out, and they sign contracts with other companies. Up 75% from this Earnings\n\n* Few failure for this next quarter. They tank ~30%.\n\nBut again, their products are being bought, and they are maximizing profits.

I think if you go search /r/buildapc you'll find some more relevant info on why the rx480 is worth it compared to the 1070/1060 and how a lot of redditors there made the switch from recommending nvidia to amd.
