{"title": "Case for VIX Short Naked Call", "selftext": "I post this hoping to get some feedback... a few weeks back I started a thread (linked below) to discuss the VIX and selling naked options (calls).  Ultimately, I walked away from that conversation still a bit puzzled because I could not grasp why there was so much fear and why it just didn't make sense to me (mathematically) to hedge yourself (selling a spread).  See below for details I'll outline and let me know your thoughts...\n\nOlder Thread (Reference)\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/6xfkry/vix/\n\nFirst, I started with a couple of questions:\n\n1. How often has the VIX doubled in 60 days?\n2. What was the largest 1 day move in the VIX?\n\nI began to answer these questions by writing some Python code.  If you want to grab the script and the VIX data I pulled from Yahoo, my GitHub link is below -- there are some extra scripts there that I wrote awhile ago but you want to grab the \"market_move_magnitude.py\" and \"vix_1990-2017.csv\" for this exercise.\n\nGitHub link: https://github.com/RoundQube/marketmove\n\nI ran the script as follows:\n\n*How often it doubled in 60 days?*\n\n**RUN:**\n./market_move_magnitude.py -i vix_1990-2017.csv -d 60 -m 2\n\n**OUTPUT:**\n440 out of 6983 (6.30%)\n\n6% of the time, in a rolling 60 day window, did the VIX double over the last 27 years.\n\n*What was the largest 1 day move?*\n\n**RUN:**\n./market_move_magnitude.py -i vix_1990-2017.csv\n\n**OUTPUT:**\nLargest Move: 16.54\tStart Date: 2008-10-21 Start Date Close: 53.11 End Date: 2008-10-22\tEnd Date Close: 69.65\n\nLargest 1 day VIX move was 16.54 -- this tells me that even on a \"bad day\", I can still get out.  When I call into shows like TastyTrade and ask for arguments against being naked short the VIX, they always say things like \"you weren't around in 2008, if you were, you know that the VIX jumped to 90!\".  Well, yes, that's true, but a) it didn't get there overnight and b) it was around 57 or so when it got to 90 (over a few days).  So, again, I just didn't see why all the fear.\n\nGiven the above, it seems to me based on my script output and OnDemand i.e. I can get out when VIX doubles and still not lose my shirt.  In fact, the occurrence is so rare, that if you STAY SMALL, it is a highly profitable and viable strategy.  So here's what I'm going to do:\n\n1. Sell VIX naked call out 60 days 2x from current trade.  VIX @ 10, I sell the 20 strike out 60 days.\n2. STAY SMALL...Credit is around $75, Margin is $452 (per TastyWorks)\n3. Buy Back @ 3x ($225 in my case above).  Now, granted, VIX will probably contract if I can stay in the trade but at this point my margin would be much higher and who knows how long it will trade that high.  Time would be working against me so at this point, I'd get out and re-establish since this was a \"rare\" occurrence.\n4. Close the position as you get closer to expiration (21 DTE or so to avoid the sensitivity to IV spike).\n\nMy contract size is strictly enforced through a spreadsheet calculator I devised...\n\nHere's the spreadsheet I posted as public on Google Docs (linked below) if you want to play with the numbers that I use to enforce how many contracts I can have.  Note, you just put in your account capital ($1500 sample already in the sheet), then it tells you how much you can allocate per trade, how many contracts you can have to ensure you are only committing 33-35% of your capital.\n\nTo summarize, I will be selling naked calls in the VIX (but staying very small).  Any profits overtime will then shuffled into less \"risky\" assets i.e. dividend paying stocks and potentially sell covered calls.  So please don't see this post as a one-trick pony, although it seems very profitable given one can have the discipline to stay small.\n\nThoughts?", "id": "716akb", "created_utc": 1505856543.0, "score": 18, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 77, "comments": [{"body": "VIX options are based off of VX futures, so why are you running a calc based on VIX?\n\nYou also need to look over jumps by percentage.

VIX futures tend to trade above spot VIX and rapidly trend to meet the spot price at expiration (see the most recent movement for sept 19 expiry). \n\n3. UVXY has way OTM calls (e.g. $80-90 strike which are almost 400% otm) with fat premiums.

The margin requirement for UVXY naked calls is actually a little absurd. To collect $3.00 in premium I only have to put up $3.00 which is a 100% return on capital when they expire worthless. I have had drawdowns which brought my margin balance to about $12.00-$15.00 per contract. However by contrast, that is the starting margin balance req for SVXY naked puts which theoretically have the same directional exposure. \n\nUltimately, selling UVXY calls is a gravy train.

I base that statement from looking at the August 2015 event. Using TOS's thinkback, we can see that a 45 day call (expiration October 2, 2015) on August 18, 2015 that meets your criteria goes for $2.39. On September 1, 2015, that call was worth > $50. That's a 21x increase. Thus, to survive that move you would need at least ~ $5K for every contract you sold.

From that, we can calculate your approximate annual return: (5000/239)*(365/45)=~39%.\n\nThe above is to just barely survive an August 2015 event (including the margin requirement, you wouldn't even survive it).

You're going to miss _a lot_ of nuance that is probably where your perceived edge is buried. For instance, what if it doubles (+100%) about 6% of the time but it also goes up 90% about another 6% of the time as well, all of the sudden that seems not as good. Or how often does it triple?\n\nThe next level is to use your data to calculate a frequency distribution of the moves for every 60 day period. That will give you a model of how often each particular move occurs over that time frame. Then a monte carlo from that distribution will give you a sense for how the VIX may perform over the next 60 days and you can forecast the expected value of the trade you're going to make. If the expected value is positive (and the VIX performs similarly to its past) then you should make money with enough occurrences.\n\nThat may sounds complicated, but you are doing the same thing already, just not as well, using the past to anticipate how likely a given move is in the future.

", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Hi, To address your reply:\n\n- 1. The VIX has always \"existed\" in the sense that option prices were always a function of implied volatility. The creation of the VIX in 1986 was just to simplify the implied volatility of the S&P500 by combining a set of S&P500 options such that you could have 1 value to represent the implied vol. One could model estimate values for the VIX, for periods before the official creation of the VIX by simply using the historical S&P price data. \n\nThe problem I have is that you are using historical data to determine worst case scenarios. Which brings me to my second point:\n\n- 2. You state that the single instance will never happen again. I'm not hating here, but I strongly believe that is an extremely foolish statement. You have to realize that using the historical worst case scenario as the worst **possible** scenario is a common fallacy among so-called traders. \n\nBanks, financial institutions, and traders conduct stress tests whereby they would simulate the worst \"possible\" scenario, by using the historical worst case. What people do not realize is that every \"worst\" case scenario in the past has always exceeded the previous \"worst\" case scenario. \n\nPrior to 1987, the worst case scenario for a single day drop in the Dow was -12.82% in 1929. Because this only happened once **and** it was way back in 1929, the possibility of its reoccurrence was considered impossible and was dismissed by traders, such as yourself. And then, in 1987, everybody experienced a revision of belief. \n\nWhat people failed to realize is that market prices are scalable and do **not** have limited upper or lower bounds. \n\nI'm assuming you are a relatively intelligent person, so please do not consider extreme events to be 'impossible', as holding that belief will only expose you to such possibilities or worse. \n\nRemember:\n- These \"worst\" case scenarios are not indicative at all of the worst **possible**  scenario. \n- Every \"worst\" case scenario always exceeded the previous \"worst\" case scenario. \n- This fallacy is the very reason why in history, banks always periodically go bankrupt. For example, the default rate of mortgages in 2008 was not anticipated purely because of the fact that the banks and rating agencies had confused the worst **historical** scenario in history with the worst **possible** scenario. But like I mentioned, there is always going to be a new \"worst\" case. \n\nNow don't take this as me saying your strategy is bad. It isn't. I am just concerned by your declarative statement saying that some particular scenario will never happen again. You cannot assign 'probabilities' to certain moves in the market.

What I meant is that circuit-breakers were put in after the 1987 crash so I'm just curious how bad can a 1 day event get if we have a circuit-breaker.  Now, granted, if we trigger a lock limit down, I believe that options will still trade, they may not be favorable prices but even at a lock limit down, I'd suspect I could close for a loss without just sitting there.\n\nIn addition, as I mentioned in my previous reply, my position will always be in the back month (I'd always close it before it got into the front month).  Thus, due to backwardation, my position would be less impacted because the VIX spot would be trading at a much higher than the /VX back month for which my option price would be based (again, closing for less of a loss than I would if I had it in the front month).\n\nThoughts?  By the way, I do completely agree as stated above that worse case is always a worst case until a new worst case comes up i.e. records are made to be broken.  But with circuit-breakers and other measures put in place from our understanding of panic selling seems to imply that I need to be careful with my position sizing but 1987-like crash is unlikely to occur from a percentage perspective in 1 day because of those safety guards put into place.\n\nEdit: Just saw your offer to educate me on your studies.

On the surface, the idea behind it makes sense. However it is not that simple.\n\nFor example: A circuit breaker will kick in at some pre-determined price level. This level is known and thus would influence the behavior of traders. If prices approach a circuit breaking level, this is indicative of market panic & volatility in and of itself. As prices approach this level, there is fear of being 'stuck' in a position without the ability to exit, resulting in an increasing rate of selloffs. \n\nThere's a good example in china when the market approached the -5% circuit breaker level. Stock prices accelerated its decline the closer it got to that level as investors were scared of being locked into a position. After the trading halt ended, there was massive fear that stock prices would decline further and reach the next circuit breaker level at -7%. This resulted in an extreme selloff after the first circuit break ended, hitting the next -7% level, resulting in many people being locked into a position. Once the break ended, a larger selloff occured.. and .... you get the idea. \n\nBut anyway, as long as your strategy prevents you from being wiped out by a single event, it's all good.

A CDO swap based in currency trades is not only harder to get in on(You won't find these option on your RobinHood account.) but doesn't have the potential for profit because the debt itself is already in currency swaps. You would essentially have to swap a currency swap which isn't an easy market to build.  \nMost of these contracts are short term. Off the top of my head I believe they are typically three months but I don't deal with currency trading so someone may correct me on this. That means that unless you expect this crash to happen in the next three months you will end up losing out on any chance of profit. Likely your contract will be leveraged and you may lose your entire principal.  \nThe easiest way of ensuring a profit without knowing when the crash may come is going long on the dollar through a leveraged contract. Even then the theta decay can easily screw you over even if you pick right. Either way CDO swaps are not something to jump into without a lot of understanding. Even a retard can buy a stock that goes up eventually, but with CDO swaps you could pick the right amount and the right dollar but if you time it wrong you could still lose money.  \n\nEDIT: While we are on this topic a much simpler Buffet-style investment would to be wait for the imminent crash and then buy into those devalued emerging markets currencies.", "score": 12, "replies": [], "tickers": ["crash"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3057752549648285}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4706874489784241}, {"body": "So we hold cash?
