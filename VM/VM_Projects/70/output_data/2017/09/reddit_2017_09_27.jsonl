A lot of good advice to be found on this thread! Glad I stumbled here... \nFor me, \"backtesting\" seems lot more reliable than options on indexes (spx, ndx, rut, etc) or ETFs (spy, qqq, iwm, etc). Somehow these seem to be manipulated..

HUGE conflict of interests. And the whole TT scheme was preparation for the real thing - tastyworks. Now when they gathered huge followship, it is much easier to attract new clients for tastyworks.\n\nUnfortunately most people are naive and don't understand the true purpose of TT. Sue, they have some good stuff, but many of their \"studies\" are completely skewed to get the results they want.\n\nHere is one example:\n\nhttps://steadyoptions.com/articles/buying-premium-prior-to-earnings-does-it-work-r89/", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I think the problem comes if people just follow what TT preaches blindly without really understanding what they are doing.

Lastly, the 50% is just a target and I'm perfectly happy to close a bunch of positions as long as they are winners.\n3) Yes but at least rolling up the untested side can minimize your max loss and also increase your break-even zone on the tested side.
