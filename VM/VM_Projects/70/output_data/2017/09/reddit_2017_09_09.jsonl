It's amazing.\n\nWhat are some recommended LONG HOLD stocks y'all think could really pay off down the road?\n\nFor example, a few years ago I asked the same and someone recommended $OLED. That's up 340% from when I bought it.\n\nLast year y'all suggested a stock that pays dividends, so I picked up $1k worth of $PG, and that's up 20% plus we have the dividend aspect. \n\nI bought her Disney, and that's been flat (actually no it's down a bit), but I wanted to get something that was relevant to her. I also got her a physical Disney stock certificate that's hanging on her wall. She loves looking at it though she doesn't understand what it is. \n\nI got Tesla the first time. That was the only stock I could think of that I thought would be a good long hold. That's up 50% from when I got it. I'm thinking maybe it's not too late to jump into Netflix, or FB, or one of these young companies that have years left of growing to do.
