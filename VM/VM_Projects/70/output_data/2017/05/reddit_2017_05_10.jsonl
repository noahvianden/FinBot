Coulombic efficiency can be used to estimate battery life time with respect to decreasing charge capacity vs number of charing cycles over various temperature ranges.  Grid battery systems need to have at least four 9s of CE. Lithium titanate is the future at ~99.9998 CE  as long as charge voltage is controlled (jury is still out of temperature sensitivity, charge/discharge times and number of charge cycles).  Aaron Smith, a former Dalhousie University grad, works at Tesla's battery research division (technically, I don't think Tesla has \"divisions\", but whatever...) and has probably duplicated research test equipment or partnered with his old university to improve battery testing so that new, beneficial chemistries, additives, electrolytes, electrodes materials and packaging can be identified within months instead of years.  Additionally, the high precision charging equipment developed at Dalhousie revealed that traditional battery research technique of measuring one additive change per experiment is actually counter productive to discovering optimal battery chemistries.  Being able to test hundreds or even thousands of combinations/concentrations at the same time is absolutely critical to making rapid progress in the development of optimized batteries.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Idiot.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Many people have asked me what the fuck happened today? I promised gains and they want a refund, their tendies are gone and spaghetti was spilt.\n\nLet me say, that everything is fine. **What happened is that a article was posted on Seeking Alpha which was bearish short term and bullish long term based on TA.** I think that a firm, or some rich fool tried to take advantage of the fact that the article could be taken as bearish to manipulate the stock. It dropped 30% in almost a minute, **that was not a natural dip anyway you look at it.** This was a man-made dip, probably guacamole. \n\n[Looking at the article which caused the dip iteself,](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4071682-northern-dynasty-naketship-flying-danger-zone?auth_param=1ds86i:1ch6eo8:f95d0ea9793373449ce7b7f6900bd01d&uprof=10&dr=1) is as I stated earlier, bearish short term and bullish long term. [The author uses TA called \"Bollinger Bonds\" which takes double the stranded deviation and adds it the 20 day average.](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bollingerbands.asp)\n\n\n**I think the author is incorrect in his application of Bollinger Bonds**, because this **stock is an almost entirely different stock that it was 20 days ago.** April 20th, was still exactly two weeks before May 4th. The day in which we were given a very positively written statemet indicating that the veto would be delayed to May 11th.\n\nOn April 20th, people had no idea what the fuck was going to happen to NAK. There was still a very big possibility that the veto would be rejected. The uncertain risk lowered the worth of the stock. Now that the veto being approved is likely, **the stock is legitimately worth more as the probability of the mine becoming a reality has increased.**\n\nFurthermore the stock was artificially (at least in my opinon) deflated by Kerrisdale. What AI ( The author of SA article) did not consider that **a large part of the uptrend from the last few days originates from the stock recovering from the crash** that happened months previously.\n\n\nRegardless I am still holding until at least Friday, as was my original plan. These price fluctuations do not change the fact that veto being approved on Friday is more likely than not. In fact the dip may be better for the stock as it scared off weak hands. **Do remember that AI's article ended on a bullish note as he was convinced that eventually the stock would shoot to the moon, he just believed that the rocketship would be closer to a staircase.**", "id": "6ag2v2", "created_utc": 1494454870.0, "score": 44, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 66, "comments": [{"body": "You know you've found a shit stock when a seeking alpha article inhibits its integrity ", "score": 37, "replies": [{"body": "When TA plus SA make your company valuation drop by 30% in under a day your company might be worthless.
