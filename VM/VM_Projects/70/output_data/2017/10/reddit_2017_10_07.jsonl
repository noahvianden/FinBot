The politicians in Puerto Rico come off as being able to stand up to and willing to act on their own without having to rely on Trump and the federal government. These talks make it seem like much is being done and that the region is moving on, with or without the continental US.\n\nIn reality, Puerto Rico is in a devastating state of affairs after these natural disasters.
