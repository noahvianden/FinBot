I'm fine with buying at $20 if I have to, because I don't think it would stay down there long, but it seems to have a lot of support at $20 right now.\n\nWith the covered call, I bought my shares at $18, so I'm okay with selling at $26 if it goes that high.\n\nI'm kind of stuck where I am right now though.
