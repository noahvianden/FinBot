The reason is because corporate C.E.O.\u2019s, whose pay or compensation is 60% in stock options have been engaging in what\u2019s known as \u201cfinancial engineering\u201d. Knowing their earnings per share will be small in this slow economy they simply buy back shares so that the earnings per share numbers will look good every quarter. The problem in doing this, besides the deceptive nature of it is that the money could have been used for improving the productivity of their companies instead. Increased productivity is the only way to increase wages. Not only are they using almost all of their profits for this as well as for dividends, they are also borrowing over $850 billion a year through bond sales to do this!\n\nThere is a big problem with having sold all those bonds. There are now over $7 trillion of them. Companies have to pay close to $200 billion a year in interest. Also, according to the Wall Street Journal they are not liquid. Post crash regulations are the reason. In order to avoid having to hold capital against them in case of a crash, banks simply put them on their books in the category \u201cheld to maturity\u201d. Banks also don\u2019t want to be dealers of them, which reduces the liquidity of getting out of them, crashing prices.\n\nThe economy barely went up in the first quarter. If we go into recession the overvalued stock market will collapse and companies won\u2019t earn enough money to pay the interest without selling more bonds. But then bond buyers will demand more than the current 4%. More and more bonds will have to be sold. Many companies will default on them. Over the last 14 years Home Depot has bought back half their shares. In a serious recession they could go bankrupt. Bloomberg Business Week magazine reported in the June 13, 2016 issue in an article titled; The Next Debt Crisis, that in 2015 corporate debt jumped $850 billion \u2013 50 times the increase in cash holdings. It also said corporations have a record $1.84 trillion in cash but only 1% of companies hold $945 billion of it. The other 99% have the lowest cash to debt ratio in ten years.\n\nThe Federal Reserve, who is in charge of setting short term rates, admitted that they dropped rates so low in order to front load the economy and stock market. They knew companies could sell bonds at a low rate, then use the money to buy back shares and the stock market would go up. They knew that though most people don\u2019t own stocks, that they would fell the economy must be doing good, and start using their credit cards again. The Fed knows 70% of the economy is consumer spending. Though people have been using their cards more, The Wall Street Journal say\u2019s the millennials, hurt by the recession, are saving more than spending and can\u2019t be of help.\nMost of the jobs created are part time. The W.S.J. said the large number of them might not be because the economy is strong, but because companies have not been improving their companies so even a modest uptick in the economy has required hireing to make up for it.\n\nRecently the Fed said that if the economy had trouble that they are prepared to buy corporate bonds, confirming what danger they pose. University of New York professor Nouriel Roubini calls them a time bomb. So now they are going to bail out the greedy C.E.O.\u2019s! They better bail out the students with $30,000 in college debt! Their future is ruined by the greedy. Oh, you know the $2.5 trillion in overseas profit Trump is going to let them Bring back at a low tax rate, guess what they plan to use it for!\n\nSo on May Day make copies of this and pass them out. Shaming the C.E.O.\u2019s is the answer!!! If the media sees banners saying; \u201cC.E.O.\u2019s start investing in your companies, not borrowing billions for stock buy backs and dividends for the rich\u201d, they won\u2019t ignore it, espeacially if it is done peacefully. If the anarchists were peaceful and held the banner, that would really shame the C.E.O.\u2019s and impress the media! Knowledge is power.\nPEACE.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Fukkin snitch\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
