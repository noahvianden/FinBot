It's not really much more than NOVACPA provides in his posts, minus the bias.  What I gathered from the between the lines in the article is that even though FNMA has grown in the number of mortgages it receives revenue since the peak of the housing bubble (by about an extra 10%-12% or so), the revenue curve is flattening, which means they've grown just about as much as they can.\n\nNot to get too deep into the accounting, but in order for these GSE to extricate themselves from Treasury control **AND** make penny stock speculators \"whole again\", the revenue generated has to simultaneously provide default insurance and mortgage market liquidity while being able to convert the 80% of the company that the treasury ownes into penny stock shares (or vice versa depending on how the bank that underwrites the refloat looks at it).  The problem is that once the NWS stop, the penny stock go through the roof making it almost impossible for the GSEs to ever make that conversion.  Furthermore, the way the penny stock market works almost guarantees it will never happen.  All of the regulatory statements that have been filed with the SEC have been for the Treasury's shares... god knows what's been going on in the completely unregulated over the counter market.  The only possible way forward is if revenue, vis-a-vis the 80% of the company that the Treasury owns, is mapped to over the counter preferreds (the key thing to keep in mind is that the preferreds are presumably owed many years of interest a par value), while the common stock is completely wiped out (or, perhaps, with an outside possibility that the 20% left over is simply relisted at whatever price the market will fetch... and probably at the same time that a shitload of new preferreds are issued).\n\nSome bits and pieces:\n\n> they\u2019re now a bigger part \n> of the system, guaranteeing payment \n> on just under half of all U.S. mortgages, \n> up from 38 percent before the crisis. \n\n(there's an accompanying graph that clearly shows the revenue slowdown)\n\n> When the government took them \n> over, Fannie and Freddie issued \n> Treasury a new class of preferred \n> stock that paid a 10 percent divi-\n> dend, along with warrants to acquire \n> almost 80 percent of the companies\u2019 \n> common stock.

I suspect the new administration has realized that they don't have to funnel the NWS revenue into the ACA and, instead, can treat it as their own slush fund for their own pet projects while simultaneously being able to starve the ACA (which I'm sure has insurance industry lobbyists frothing at the mouth).\n\n> Mnuchin put one of his coun-\n> selors, Craig Phillips, in charge of the \n> situation.

In the IPO they have to raise capital, so they will need to treat some class of shareholders equitably to be able to do the capital raise.\n\nRemember that community banks were told by regulators for years that GSE preferred stock could be counted as regulatory capital. When all of this happened, they had to write it down, raise real capital in a bad market, or shut their doors. With the ICBA meeting with the admin multiple times, Trump talking about breaking up the big banks (unlikely, but shows what he's thinking), and Mnuchin at the ICBA conference over the MBA conference this week, it appears that community banks will be taken care.
