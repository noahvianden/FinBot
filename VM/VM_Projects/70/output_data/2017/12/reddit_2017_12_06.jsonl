For you that basket is the tech sector. So diversification won't protect you from loss or guarantee you higher gains. BUT the one thing it does provide without a doubt is it reduces risks. Even though in your head you have justified the reason to why you pick the tech sector as the one to bet on, do not forget what history has taught us about picking favorites with sectors or stocks. You can't play favorites. When it comes to investing you have to keep your emotions in check and invest like a robot do not allow your investments to be controlled by a bias. It happens to everyone it is the hardest part of investing in my humble opinion. The good news is you seem open to it.

Also another issue. VALUATION after sometime of a sector doing well you'll find that companies start to become overvalued vs it's intrinsic value thus leaving you less or no safety of margin. I respect all investors and their thought process after all no two people think in the same exact way. But the idea of diversification is well established and logical. I suggest you read \"the intelligent investor\" it's invaluable . Bottom line I wouldn't say you are wrong but your methodology isn't without much higher risk taking.
