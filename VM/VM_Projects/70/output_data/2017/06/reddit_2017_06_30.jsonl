{"title": "Some extremely shitty, boring thoughts", "selftext": "You're given a special coin that has a **60% chance of being heads.** You start off with $25. If the coin lands on the side you call, you double your money. If you're wrong, you lose your money. You can wager as much or as little as you want.\n\n[This is the result of the people that played the game.](http://i.imgur.com/WZBoWYy.png\n) The full article is [here.](https://www.ft.com/content/7cd9b6c8-9cd7-11e6-8324-be63473ce146?mhq5j=e3) You can get past the paywall by going through Google by searching \"What flipping a loaded coin can tell you about stock.\"\n\nThe first row shows the people truly trying hard to flex their retard strength, betting $25 on tails and simultaneously investing their entire retirement account in $RAD. The rest didn't do as badly, but 79% of players failed to hit maximum gains (winnings were capped at $250). \n\n**HOWEVER, if you were to bet on heads 100% of the time and wager 20% of your hand every time, you would have a 95% chance of reaching the max hand.** If you were uncapped and had 30 minutes to flip at a pace of a flip per 6 seconds, you'd end up with 2 million dollars.\n\nThe allure of betting it all on some meme stock and getting rich fast is sexy, but if you're losing money in a bull market, you need to stop flexing your retard strength. This market is a 60% probability coin in your favor. Invest in consistent patterns in companies that have a high probability of getting you positive returns, even if the returns aren't 100%, and keep a stock long enough that it can break away from the day to day volatility and eventually bring you home some cash in the long term.\n\n", "id": "6kh43u", "created_utc": 1498841086.0, "score": 142, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 76, "comments": [{"body": "But all I have is my retard strength.", "score": 113, "replies": [{"body": "I lost all of that this week and am now just a hollow shell of a yolo that would never be", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "I'm bag holding to the grave.
