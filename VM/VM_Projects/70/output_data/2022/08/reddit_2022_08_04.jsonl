{"title": "8-4-22 Spy/ ES Futures and Daily TA", "selftext": "Did we finally witness the bulls exhaust themselves or was this just a case of resting to reset the indicators before the next leg up? \n\nToday once it closes will be the lowest volume day of 2022 so far close under 50 million for the day. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/98mitb2kurf91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd7c26888ee81fe97f8c0803f25ea1fb01cab7cc\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sbtc3hlkurf91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=c88ea1e5394eb195f95129365fa4000c35c7f454\n\nAs you can see we have finally broken the 7 day long extreme momentum bull support. Now that does not mean that we broke the full bull channel support it just shows that the extreme bull momentum that started on July 27th until yesterday has been broken. We still have the overall 8 week long bull channel support which will be at about 408.7 tomorrow. \n\nThere are a couple things to point out from today that are key in my opinion. \n\nThis was the lowest volume day of the year which either means we finally saw bulls exhaust themselves or it means no one is ready to buy here but no one is ready to sell here either as they are indecisive of whether we are going higher or lower next.\n\nWe are still trading between the daily 100ema and daily 200ema which overall is neutral and I have since last week said that which ever one of those breaks first is the way we are going to go. \n\nThe bears clocked a really nice double top doji in today with 415.6 being the major resistance point. Overall my expectation is that we have another red day tomorrow where we are going to trade between 415.6 and 408.1 (at the extreme). From there I will be looking at the sell off to start on Monday next week before CPI comes on Wednesday August 10th. I highlighted the Friday and Mondays before the last four CPIs and almost all of them the Friday before was the peak. I am working on my CPI post right now and that should be up later tonight too. Overall I am planning to go in on puts EOD tomorrow. \n\nNow in the off chance that we see bulls come back in with some good volume tomorrow and break that 415.6 resistance level they are going to need to capitalize on that momentum and close over the daily 200ema in order to continue the bull trend next week. Failing to break the daily 200ema tomorrow and especially a hard rejection there tomorrow would all but secure a bearish week next week. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mf2t3kflurf91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=c52ee01b17f6e0e5f7ad0288f21705cb763ad5fe\n\nES Futures is looking pretty similar, however, its extreme bull trend has not been broken yet and that support will be at 4139 and be key to watch not only over night but intraday tomorrow. Its key resistance to watch will be at the 4177 level and their daily 200ema is at 4183. If bulls fail to break these levels tomorrow it looks like we are seeing the rising wedges fail and I fully expect some down side. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k1fc6pamurf91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=8f819667ba9d69dc6c19c0c078d9f378de06eb99\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dsl9w2wmurf91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=3be360d1e2f775348cc868f9530ae78f5cab77ac\n\nThe main takeaway from the weekly charts is that the 415 and 4164 levels continue to remain heavy resistance. We saw a very aggressive rejection there twice this morning and once during power hour today. I suspect that we are going to continue to see this rejection and I will favor downside next week if bears can close under those key levels. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3wrejnknurf91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=904955441d8a2fc971139c485f83ce1bbbf4a722\n\nAfter apples pretty impressive day yesterday it was pretty much a bust today. The most important takeaway from Apple today is that we saw it close out a doji and maintain 166.2 as key resistance. It also failed to break its rising wedge resistance. As you can see by the \u201cyou are here\u201d highlighted with arrow I am expecting a pullback tomorrow and early next week to retest that red line bull channel support down near 161. However, for tomorrow 164.6 remains key support for the bulls to hold. If we see that support break (this support is similar to the one SPY broke today) then we are going to be looking for the next sell off. \n\n10% challenge-\n\nToday was one of those days where 99% of people probably woulda been better sitting cash gang. I took two small wins today and was pretty happy with that with all things considered. Despite today being a \u201crange\u201d day this was probably one of the most choppy range days I have seen in a very long time. We had a lot of really big candles with very little follow through. We were blessed with 15 reversals today. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6bnqlq4ourf91.png?width=756&format=png&auto=webp&s=f3ac28f539be666336c9902530026ef24cce7bc7\n\nAlso for those of you who would prefer a video version of this I am now posting these to youtube every night (just know that the video part wont be up till later at night as I gotta wait for the kiddos to go to sleep so I can have some peace and quiet).", "id": "wgdzsm", "created_utc": 1659651567.0, "score": 73, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 73, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total

No denying open market volume is declining and could be reflecting retail sentiment ig but that\u2019s wild guesses and me trying to make sense of things. The big gap down reminds me of the massive CPI gap down in July which was like 3% in 5minutes time that was then patched up by White House saying \u201cCPI is outdated\u201d and fed in pre market and during market open. So these deep gaps are reflective of true economy imo but the patching up means further upside is to be expected. The main driver of my bearish sentiment is that apple hit major resistance, truly I should have waited for a confirmation and my portfolio is almost down 100% at this point lol. The top is near and I don\u2019t want to risk missing it. Todays \u201cgood news\u201d was treated as \u201cbad\u201d news and tech lagged indicating a rotation.  If I didn\u2019t enter mid day I probably wouldn\u2019t have entered at all. That was a disgusting pump on close tbh. So more than likely they keep the running up a thing for another week or so. The weekly closures are dojis imo or look like they could be potential reversal candles. We\u2019re up too much too fast even a basic retracement for a bull case continuation is due. The futures have a rising wedge that should break by Wednesday also. Could be up could be down. I\u2019m betting down and it should happen Monday because past 6 weeks Vix has almost always gapped up (opens before 9:30 am and is usually unwound by then).
