{"title": "Bank Of America Warns Of \u2018Textbook\u2019 Bear Market Rally, Predicting New Lows For Stocks", "selftext": "Though stocks have mounted a stunning comeback from June lows as investors grow more optimistic about cooling inflation and the Federal Reserve potentially scaling back interest rate hikes, the recent rebound is nothing more than a \u201cclassic bear\u201d market rally which is likely to hit new lows, according to analysts at Bank of America.\n\nThe summer stock market rally looks to be almost over, according to a recent note from Bank of America chief investment strategist Michael Hartnett, who points to data suggesting that recent gains are a \u201ctextbook\u201d bear market rally which is poised to soon run out of steam.\n\nThe S&P 500 has jumped more than 15% since hitting a low point for the year in mid-June, in large part thanks to better-than-expected economic data\u2014including a strong jobs report and cooling in consumer prices\u2014in recent weeks.\n\nDespite investor hopes that the worst has passed after a brutal selloff in the first half of 2022, analysts at Bank of America are among experts ramping up warnings in recent weeks that stocks still have further to fall.\n\n\u201cEveryone is bearish but no one has sold stocks,\u201d Hartnett says, pointing to irrational trading activity in meme stocks and adding that after four straight weeks of gains, the market is showing many characteristics of what is likely to be a \u201cself-defeating rally.\u201d\n\nThe Bank of America analyst points to the fact that out of 43 bear market rallies since 1929 in which the S&P 500 gained over 10%, the average increase is roughly 17.2% over 39 trading days\u2014meaning that the current rally appears to be maxed out, according to historical data.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, even after increasing the federal funds rate by 2.25% so far this year, the Federal Reserve is \u201cnowhere near done\u201d with rate hikes to combat inflation, he warns, which will likely put a ceiling on recent market gains.\n\nWHAT TO WATCH FOR:\n\nOther analysts at the firm have issued similar warnings in recent days. Bank of America\u2019s head of U.S. equity and quantitative strategy, Savita Subramanian, said in a note to clients on Tuesday that stock market valuations remain far too high for the bear market to be over. A sustained bull market remains \u201cunlikely,\u201d she wrote, citing indicators that instead signal a looming end to the recent bear market rally.\n\nSURPRISING FACT:\n\nA bear market rally tends to \u201calways narrow\u201d in terms of leadership, Hartnett adds, pointing to the fact that the likes of Apple, Amazon and Tesla have accounted for outsized portions of the market\u2019s recent rebound. Those three stocks have each risen by more than 30% since the market low point on June 16, far outpacing the benchmark index.\n\nSource: [https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2022/08/19/bank-of-america-warns-of-textbook-bear-market-rally-predicting-new-lows-for-stocks/?sh=7671430d2ac5](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2022/08/19/bank-of-america-warns-of-textbook-bear-market-rally-predicting-new-lows-for-stocks/?sh=7671430d2ac5)\n\nBank of America (BAC) chief investment strategist Michael Hartnett says the market's recent gains is a \u201ctextbook\u201d bear market rally which is set to soon run out of steam.

{"title": "AVYA... activist investor, funds loading, ceo on the interview circuit.", "selftext": "Yo,\n\nFirst to the mods: this company was a 1.75b market cap company at the beginning of the year, has been crushed and it's mkt cap tanked, but for most of it's life similar to GME it met the mkt cap threshold.\n\nGist: Avaya is a distressed well know brand that has potential for a restructure opportunity, new management has entered the picture and set on  turning things. New CEO Alan Masarek who was the CEO of Vonage  took Vontage from  $3.51 to $10 then stepped away at the peak, so he's not a chode. Here's an article (*published today*)  \\[[New CEO Alan Masarek talks the future of Avaya](https://siliconangle.com/2022/08/22/new-ceo-alan-masarek-talks-future-avaya/)\\] in which he talks about the future for Avaya. Would suggest you read it  since he talks about fixing the capital structure, his plans for modernizing the business, and how Avaya got into this situation. Here's bull porn snippet from the article:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/85o7815eyij91.png?width=1556&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc752486752b351e8431bdf787a439b3ac27950f\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, recently filings show activist investor with twitter fingers hulking shares. August filings also show that other funds have joined the game swallowing shares with such fervor would think  they work for OnlyFans. The net effect of  so much buying is that  reduction of shares is starting to show up in  short metrics.\n\n# Today\u2019s filing [[link](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001418100/000089924322029450/xslF345X03/doc4.xml)]\n\nDude named King Theodore Walker Cheng-De ( *the activist investor*)  spammed the buy button on Avaya and is now a 15%+ holder. What\u2019s cool about this is that the [original](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001418100/000119312522224146/d358952dsc13g.htm) 13g disclosed that he owned 11,432,250 as of Aug 8th. A few weeks later he decides to double dip and get around 1.8m more shares so now he owns 13,231,350 shares . Nice now he owns 15.4% of shares outstanding.\n\nFrom [https://whalewisdom.com/stock/avya](https://whalewisdom.com/stock/avya) we have the following whales with filings as recent as 8/15 and no later than 8/9\n\n**Vanguard owns**: 9,531,774  - 11%\n\n**Capital World**: 8,369,041 - 9.7%\n\n**Blackr0ck**: 7476,255 - 8.7%\n\n**American Centurry Companies**: 5,950,649 - 6.9%\n\n**Theodore** \\- 12,231,360 = 14.41%\n\nTotal = **43,559,079**\n\nNot going to keep going but just showing that other funds have been ape\u2019ing into shares of Avaya as recently as last week.\n\nSo, we have a stock thats -98% from its 2021 high with a recent vocal activist investor, we have multiple funds ape'ing to Avaya this month, and new CEO and new management. If AVAYA pays off 2.25% 2023 convertible note with the  $221 million in escrow, or if they release a 8k regarding a turnaround plan, or if more filings come out showing that even more tutes are loading it should fly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g6k462njyij91.png?width=566&format=png&auto=webp&s=4699650fe8c7cb22a94130b9aa00b0a88917699e\n\nYou may notice that Avaya market gap is 60million, yet they have $404million of cash on hand, and $221m cash in escrow. They also authorized 147m of buybacks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aemto33lyij91.png?width=1168&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed8936d9c96d92c2b7f623ccc2bbde9a8434a189\n\nAgain they have a 60million market cap, can see that in 2019 there were talks to spinoff a part of Avaya business for 4billion.\n\n# Why the move today?\n\n(1) The interview with the CEO? (2) Theodore King bought more shares (3) Theodore released a letter 5page letter about Avaya.\n\nCan view Theo\u2019s letter here direct here in the 13g filing: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001418100/000119312522227517/d359845dsc13ga.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001418100/000119312522227517/d359845dsc13ga.htm)\n\nYou can read his thesis for why he\u2019s spamming Avaya aggressively for millions and selling puts. His letter is  instructive, and a better summation than my smoothed brain can manage. If you skim through you\u2019ll see Theo has a PT of $25.\n\nWant more bull porn? Ok fine below see JP Morgan reiterating  $7 PT last week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ibc1v0qmyij91.jpg?width=1242&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fcbe4a06dd47dea25d843fa2b69a03a5d917dd11\n\nThat\u2019s about it. That\u2019s the setup. Avaya's software is very prevalent btw basically every company uses them.\n\n# Hold up wait need the squeeze weather forecast:\n\nCan see above that juicy setup, CTB/ON-LOAN/UTLIZATION increasing, while on-loan avg age is decreasing to flat. So I interpret this as shares being sucked from float making the short metrics rise. In fact, we know that total shares outstanding 85,836,560. If we add up all the shares 6 funds mentioned earlier own we get 43.5m shares. So that's around 50% of shares outstanding. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/60ljsjynyij91.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=4fec358aed8a024f8187e2a5a2da05a86941abfb\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3ho2d4nwyij91.png?width=1350&format=png&auto=webp&s=793ba172a75279f0b37e389a1253e50869b7b314\n\n&#x200B;\n\nChecking the price and volume can see volume increasing, rsi getting a bit of legs, but more importantly can see we are at the absolutely ground floor, even with Avaya impressive performance on an absolute puke day for the market.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWrapping things up SI is 20% of float since 15m shares are sold short . Given  that Avaya has 85,836,560 shares outstanding and if we add the 6 funds mentioned early stakes we come to **43,559,079** shares locked up   by tutes. So, let's do some math for the float: 85.837m-43.55m =42.337m. I only did this quickly and roughly there are other holders if you want you can go to [https://whalewisdom.com/stock/avya](https://whalewisdom.com/stock/avya) yourself and calculate. ***However, given this info can reasonable say that the 36% of float is close to shorted, and kinda of explains the increase in short metrics while the average age of loans is flat - tutes sucking shares away.***\n\nSo to recap the activist investor Theo is active on Twitter (always a plus) check the language below to see why this is good.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j2wtn92e0jj91.jpg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0ff6925db89ee3cd4a3a74ef8ad98cc5a31c58db\n\nHe\u2019s not alone in the August 13f's  filings shown that  other firms have also opening up significant positions, solid new CEO doing the media circuit, short metrics solid and juicy, activist investor throwing out a $25 PT and JP Morgan reaffirming $7, lastly Avaya market cap is 60m have 404million cash on hand and 221m cash restricted in escrow and have guided revenue of $712m and have authorized 147m in buybacks. ***You want even more DD?*** Check activist investor Theodore's thesis he posted on google drive *(link:* [*https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eycdOLuup\\_onwAWfMWmu1AgjR\\_68HzPa/view*](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eycdOLuup_onwAWfMWmu1AgjR_68HzPa/view) *which is now in the 13g filing* [*https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001418100/000119312522227517/d359845dsc13ga.htm*](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001418100/000119312522227517/d359845dsc13ga.htm)*)*.\n\nYou may not realize now, but I this is  a bomb.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/59rzo8tvyij91.gif\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Made a mistake in my calculations edited.\n\nwhat;s the mistake?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xid7k0uouyj91.png?width=2764&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d98d6c4c8a577ce01fbab68ee9d083d2d16b62f\n\nPRN according to whalewisdom means shares associated with converitble debt, so once the price goes past a certain point holders can exercise. In Theodores letter he states $3.41 is the strike but they can't convert until Oct 1. These guys hedge so they are the ones getting squeezed rn, they can't convert notes to cover the shorts. lol Sheesh the setup is wild.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r5gckmepuyj91.png?width=1296&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a20f68ed406cfae519f58219b481ea676458c1f\n\nAnyway, I excluded these guys from the float calculations and included firms that own 5%+ of shares to come to  a lower number around. In [another post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wxq7ve/avya_a_look_at_the_new_ceos_compensation_letter/) that looks at CEO compensation/holdings so around 40% of shares are shorted and possibly if we include the estimated short interest now 50%.

I think he\u2019s implying a squeeze without saying it directly. Hence the quote \"*The market topology at present time is highly favorable*\" and \"*significant short covering of the 14.98M shares currently short,*\" which is pretty clear.... on pg 3.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Between now and October 1st 2022 when the 8% 2027 Notes become convertible \u2013 prior to this date, if there is a sharp upward movement in price, there would likely be significant short covering of the 14.98M shares currently short, which would reflexively need to be purchased and likely with sequential failure to deliver events, given the technical inability to convert the Notes into Common Equity according to the Indenture. In turn, this could bring the 2027 8% Notes back ITM and very likely above par.  \n>  \n>Furthermore, the market making operations in Avaya\u2019s common equity are highly unusual given the trading volume relative to the free float (\\~48M shares traded in the 24-hour period of August 19th).

So I'm getting a bit confused  but CB holders can covert for $3.42 a share October 1st, I see incentive for them to do this if if the price is above this level after this date? If it's above this level it implies rapid price appreciation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHopefully, someone chimes in and helps me analyze this. A unique situation.
