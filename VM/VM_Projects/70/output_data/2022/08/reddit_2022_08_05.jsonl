Russia invaded Ukraine and put strains on natural gas, oil and grain.\n\nThe pandemic ended and the businesses opened up. The supply chain issues largely cleared up other than chip manufacturers and that's getting better. People are returning to traditional employment. Inflation is misunderstood on wsb; it is tanking. Russian invasion has ground to a standstill will a large Ukrainian counter offensive assumed. There is a deal set for grain exports that will avoid mass starvation in the middle east and a wave of European immigration. Because things are looking good, the fed is already discussing slowing how much they're raising rates.\n\nLet's look at what inflation is. A burger is $1. It goes to $1.50. 50% inflation. If it remains at $1.50 for months, that's zero inflation. Prices will not return to their old prices. That doesn't mean inflation isn't dead. Grocery and gas and housing prices went up. It was noticeable week to week. Do you still notice them going up? I don't.\n\nWe are already in a recession, mild, and undeclared. It will be declared after it passes. As wsb debates if we're in one, it is quietly sailing past.
