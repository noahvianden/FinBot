New traders usually end up losing money, so be careful. \nTo support my view:\nhttps://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/retail-investors-lose-big-options-markets-research-shows \n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u25cfThere are low chances that you will be the next Burry. \n\n\u25cfDon't time the market. June proved to many that they suck at timing the market, while people who timed it right; congrats and ...you know what. Enjoy your luck. Don't fomo puts, because you can get burned like bears couple of weeks ago. I still remember people saying that \"it can't get any higher, it will crash next Monday, Im buying puts\" to just see market showing them big green middle finger.\n\n\u25cfRed days after such rally are healthy, so don't act like it's the begging of the big crash. It can crash or go sideways, definitely it will go to the right. That's all we know. Don't rush things and buy puts asap after reading one youtube video or a few comments on Reddit.\n\n\u25cfYou will compete on the whole different level than just buy/sell shares strategy... If you need advice whether you should buy Apple or Meta, or if you should buy now or during crash, then most probably options are not for you. If you don't believe me, Google why retailers are losing on options.\n\n\u25cf\"Market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent\" is exactly about playing puts. \n\n\u25cfIf you get rock solid seeing these massive gains from puts, jerk off for the post nut clarity, then read about the survivorship bias. \n\nHappy to see others opinions. Use puts responsibly or go yolo to post a massive gain/loss for some reddit awards in that place.
