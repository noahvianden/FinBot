Where are they now?\n\n\n\nEbay used to be the one place online to buy/sell things, worldwide. Partnered with PayPal you had the whole online marker, both for amateurs and smaller businesses. When did you last buy anything om Ebay?\n\n\n\nEnron was the American miracle, a company dominating like no other and everyone (and their 401k) went all in on the safest bet.
