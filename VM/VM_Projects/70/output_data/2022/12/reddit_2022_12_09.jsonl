{"title": "With everyone so focused on inflation, no one is talking about growth", "selftext": "Inflation and rising interest rates was the big story of 2022. As we approach the end of the year, and the Fed terminal rate of 4.5-5%, people seem to be cheering the death of inflation, but they're conveniently leaving out the growth part of the story.\n\nThe most recent update to forward EPS projections is now at 225 EPS for 2023 ([https://www.yardeni.com/pub/yriearningsforecast.pdf](https://www.yardeni.com/pub/yriearningsforecast.pdf)).\n\nThat means that at S&P 4000, we'd be trading at a 18 forward P/E. The historical average over the last 10 years is a 17x forward P/E, but this was with effectively 0% interest rates.\n\nGrowth is continuing to slow, and there's a real chance we'll see further earnings revisions to the downside.\n\nIn other words, the market is over valued because \"Santa rally\", or because the market would rather focus on inflation coming down instead of actual earnings growth and valuation multiples. I called out in a previous post that the market would rally into year end, and possibly into January, but it's likely a Bull trap as all we've really done over the last 2 months is multiple expansion, not real earnings growth.\n\nWhat do you think is a fair multiple at 4%+ interest rates? I would argue 16x forward makes sense, so on 225 EPS that would make the fair value of the S&P 3600 today. Obviously this isn't a perfect method of valuation and there are many other factors to consider, this is just a framework for how I think about a potential trading range we could see into next year.", "id": "zh3fim", "created_utc": 1670607521.0, "score": 97, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 72, "comments": [{"body": "Hi, you're on r/Stocks, please make sure your post is related to stocks or the stockmarket or it will most likely get removed as being off-topic/political; feel free to edit it now and be more specific.\n\n**To everyone commenting:**  Please focus on how this affects the stock market or specific stocks or it will be removed as being off-topic/political.\n\nIf you're interested in just politics, see our wiki on [\"relevant subreddits\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index) and post to those Reddit communities instead without linking back here, thanks!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Pretty insane\u2026 didn\u2019t quite hit that 390.1 support but we came pretty close. \n\nThis morning we got PPI.. interestingly enough we had a beat on CORE PPI YoY, a beat on PPI ex food/energy/ transport YoY and a beat on PPI YoY (though they did come in over forecast). However, we had a miss on CORE PPI MoM and no change in PPI MoM. \n\nThe markets reacted pretty negatively to it with a red open. We did however recover intraday. So this now brings up the question for CPI next week\u2026 Will markets ignore a beat on CPI and focus on MoM or Core more? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r3j9l53cdy4a1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=b859c2ec1565dbfa567548e76b1ef5e313a9598b\n\nLets take a quick look at CPI numbers now that we FINALLY have consensus numbers\u2026\n\nCPI YoY= consensus-7.3 (previous 7.7)  \n CPI MoM= consensus-0.3 (previous 0.4)  \n CORE YoY= consensus- 6.1 (previous 6.3)  \n CORE MoM= consensus- 0.3 (previous 0.3)\n\nbest case=   \n CPI YOY- 7.1 (big beat)  \n CPI MoM- 0.1 (beat)  \n CORE YoY- 5.9 (beat)  \n CORE MoM- 0.1 (beat)\n\nworse case=  \n CPI YOY- 7.5 (beat)  \n CPI MoM- 0.5 (miss)  \n CORE YoY- 6.3 (no change)  \n CORE MoM- 0.5 (miss)\n\nLooking at this (and I will go WAY more into detail this weekend when I have some more time to look at the numbers and I will make a full on trade plan for next week\u2026 hope to post it tomorrow morning). \n\nOverall the best case scenario is a bullish beat. We still don\u2019t get negative MoM numbers which markets might not receive well but this scenario should result in a big green open again. However, the worst case scenario puts us at a miss on everything but CPI YoY\u2026 If CORE doesn\u2019t change and we get a MoM increase on CPI and CORE I think this is going to be received terribly. This is actually the exactly scenario that played out in September. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d389fswcdy4a1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=047e50a668049c216c35b4daadf22cb7a515bbba\n\nInterestingly enough though When we look at the trend leading into last CPI we are seeing a very similar pattern. We had a breakout followed by a pretty nice sell off, followed by a big recovery with a doji candle and then a sell off leading into CPI. If this pattern and the technical play out we should see 390.1 support test on Monday. \n\nI mentioned that black and blue diamond pattern over night yesterday. We not only tested the resistance of that black bear channel we also fell out of the support line of the diamond pattern. With that and a rejection of the daily 8ema while closing under the daily 20ema and also confirming the key level of 395 as resistance now I am looking for a fairly large break down Monday. \n\nStrictly technical and not even factoring in the CPI sell off that could happen like last month this gravestone doji using the previous candle body support level of 395 and turning it into resistance and falling back under the daily 20ema is an extremely bearish pattern. \n\nI had mentioned previously for the last month really we traded in a tight 395 to 402.3 pattern. We broke back into that channel yesterday, however, we lost I and had a pretty impressive sell off EOD. \n\nLooking at the last 11 CPIs the day before\u2026 6 out of 11 of those CPIs closed red with an average drop of -1.15% and 5 out of 11 of those CPIS closed +1.27%. Not really enough to take a trade off of.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o33jtxjddy4a1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e2a05bd1a3092b226af2a70e1bb19acf3831d3f\n\nTaking a look at last CPI we had a pretty impressive sell off EOD dropping a total of 1.4% in 4 hours at the EOD. Historically in the beginning of the year and also in the summer time we would very often see 1 to 1.5% sells that started anywhere between 12pm and 1pm and pretty much continued till the EOD. We saw that return last pre-CPI day.\n\nThe one thing I can almost guaranteed though is that Monday will be yet again another very choppy day. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/srcp9y2edy4a1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=8363cf61ec62a047d44e5368e7850755e4be656d\n\nThe interesting thing is that the technical are actually setting us up for a pretty big drop over the next few weeks. Whether that is fueled by CPI, FOMC, both or something else is to be determined. The weekly chart is showing that last weeks resistance touch was the actual top and we should with this close lower look for more downside. \n\nSupport- 390 -> 375\n\nResistance- 399 -> 407 (2022 bear channel resistance) ->  408.8\n\nA few scenarios I have in my head right now\u2026\n\n1. CPI misses -> huge 3-4% drop -> FOMC confirms 50bps and 50bps next meeting -> huge 3% drop -> market goes into another downward trend for a few weeks. \n\n2. CPI beats -> 3-4% pop (possibly a flat open could be on the table\u2026 we have only had one of those this year) -> FOMC confirms 50bps and 50bps next meeting -> huge 3-4% drop to erase all of CPI gains -> market goes in sell off mode again \n\n3. CPI misses -> huge 3-4% drop -> FOMC confirms 50bps and 25bps next meeting -> huge 3% rally-> market goes into bull mode and runs hella high till January earnings  \n\n4. CPI beats -> 3-4% pop (possibly a flat open could be on the table\u2026 we have only had one of those this year) -> FOMC confirms 50bps and 25bps next meeting -> huge 3% rally-> market goes into bull mode and runs hella high till January earnings  \n\nPersonally I believe option 1 and 2 are the most realistic and I believe that 1 is the case that we might get\u2026 \n\nI just feel too many people are expecting another massive 3% green open on a beat and are expecting JPOW to \u201cslow rate hikes/ pivot\u201d and that there is going to be a lot of people disappointed. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l4z8fq6fdy4a1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ae00f163eac17df36c533d5b7c0d93b6b09a944\n\nI am seeing a really nice bull flag forming on the VIX daily chart right now too. WE have been trading in this very narrow and very tight channel for 6 full days now. We did retouch and confirm 22.2 as support today also. This is the 3rd doji close in a row. I will be looking with Monday being the day before CPI for a push up on the VIX to that 23.6 level. \n\nFun fact - the lowest VIX close (day before) for CPI (since june) is 21.76 and the highest VIX close (day before) for CPI (since june) was 33.58. The average close (the day before\u2026. Dating back to June) was 26.71. \n\nI mentioned that I was suspecting this to play out similar to the September CPI (in regards to a CPI YoY beat but miss on MoM/ core and we see a huge dump). When we compare the VIX in September to now the vix closed at 23.86 the day before CPI and currently we are projected to close somewhere between 23 and 25. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3rueil4gdy4a1.png?width=631&format=png&auto=webp&s=6cb03def589acf77a17d2c8df619d89d5c659799\n\nOne more thing about the VIX which also supports my narrative that we are about to start the next major leg down is that as you can see here I mentioned a few times now that every single bear top was put in once the VIX touched 19.7\u2026 IF my scenarios play out correctly and we get that September type of miss\u2026 we could be looking that when the December 10th candle touched and rejected 410 that was the top of the current bear rally. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j10tigogdy4a1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=e43a0a3b32fb25fb71adc0f16c1021542aa757d1\n\nThis brings me back to my last weeks TA where I asked is the top of this rally in or not? IF last week truly was the top (December 1st) and we truly are about to see our next leg down\u2026 we should all be loading 60+DTE puts here for an impending dump to 320s by the first week of February. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wbr9ec8hdy4a1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f039654ae21d50185d422f5c7fcee9cfe37dbf5\n\nOne last thing to mention\u2026 is the JPM collar that currently sits at 3425\u2026 historically speaking this year the trend has been a breakout to the CC area (currently 3870) followed by a pretty massive sell off leading into the quarter expiration where JPM rotates their collar. The expiration is December 30th. Now we do not usually break through that collar but last collar (I need to go back and see my TA to give you some better info on this (I will after next week shapes up). \n\nThis could mean that we really are headed to the mid 300s/3000s again\u2026 If we wanted to touch the puts (we don\u2019t usually but are close) then over the next 21 days we should see SPY drop about 14%. While 14% in three weeks is quite impressive when we look at other CPI/ FOMC weeks we have had quite a few 10%+ sell off weeks this year. \n\nWhat do I actually think? Do I think the tops in? Do I think we really see 320 by EOM? (if you only wanna hear TA based opinions top reading here this will be speculation). \n\nMy initial \u201cconspiracy theory thought\u201d is that EVERYONE is calling for a Santa Rally and I only am seeing people positioning themselves bullishly and I am hearing a lot more \u201cwhen we see 430-440\u201d talk than I am hearing \u201cwhen we see 360 again\u201d talk\u2026 there is no way that \u201cthey\u201d let this run that high. This market works in cycles\u2026 the closer we get to the top and the more people that start thinking the cycles are over the better chance that the huge reverse is coming.\n\nIt is not lost upon me the \u201cirony\u201d (probs wrong choice of words) that we on December 1st touched the bear market resistance line and hard rejected. Its also not lost on me that Since Last CPI we have not had any upward movement. Besides the JPOW speech last week where SPY randomly shot up 3.15% which broke us out of our consolidation channel we have essentially been trading withing a $7 channel with a few outliers. \n\nSomething very interesting about this time frame from CPI to CPI is that this is the lowest +/- movement from CPI to CPI that SPY has had all year. We have only move about 3.8% total +/- (taking the high of CPI day and finding the highest/ lowest move over the month that happens from CPI to CPI). However, the average CPI to CPI +/- move (excluding this current 3.8%) is 8.2%. That means we have made 46% of the move that usually happens from CPI to CPI. \n\nWhats even crazier to think about is the fact that 3.15% of that movement came from one single day (JPOW speech day). Why the low movement? Why have we been stuck in this tight range since CPI? My thoughts are that the markets do not believe the CPI beat from last month. I think Markets REALLY focused on the YoY beat and failed to take into consideration that we have not had a SINGLE negative MoM CPI or CORE MoM print this year. \n\nTrend wise this year we have not had a single back to back green open on CPI day. Now is that because once we get a beat and a huge green day markets become more critical? Perhaps\u2026 \n\nMy thoughts are that this price action that occurred all week long where we had Monday and Tuesday dumping us on seemingly no news at all, impossible to trade price action where VOLD/ volume and premiums are completely disconnected from reality and this huge EOD sell off that we had today and the most critical thing is this reaction to the poor MoM PPI reading\u2026 I believe the top of this bear market rally is in and regardless of what we do next and what CPI brings JPOW is going to hard reality check this market and we are headed back to the mid 300s before EOY. \n\nMy prediction is we close somewhere near 390 (probably below it) on Monday. CPI YoY beats, CORE YoY (unchanged) and we get a decent miss on CPI/ CORE MoM and that markets react extremely negatively. I think markets see that while we are making YoY progress on CPI there really has not been much progress made on CORE and MoM consistently is rebounding. Now its POSSIBLE we get a super wonky reading and CPI YoY comes in unchanged but that would need a variance of 0.4% from consensus, Bloomberg terminal estimates and Cleveland fednowcast which has not happened. The biggest variance I have noted is 0.3% this year. But anything is possible\u2026\n\nI also think JPOW is going to stick with 50bps regardless of what CPI is but I think he is going to say its pre-mature to continue slowing and that we are getting another 50bops at next meeting (25bps is priced in and expected). I also think we are going to get a terrible dot plot/ fed funds rate trajectory and much like last two FOMCs we are going to end up with a massive EOD sell off once the presser starts. \n\nWe also have monthly options expiration on Friday too. \n\nMy expectation come Friday is that we close somewhere in my red channel from 370.7 to 378.1.\n\n**$5k/ 10% challenge weekly/ month recap-**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mruiwulidy4a1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=d5ca6015dc0c7e5fd296b288c5c1476413655a9b\n\nMonday and Tuesday thankfully were great trading days for me but I ended up putting in a red week for the challenge with a net profit of -$300\u2026. I am still up $3,820 from the challenge itself though. \n\nThat means over the last month of strictly scalp one trade a day at $5000 with a goal of 10% and utilizing a 15% stop loss I have netted $3820 over a months time or about $955/ week on average. Nothing amazing but definitely something. I look forward to continuing this challenge. \n\n**Daily log weekly recap-**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6xy4d64jdy4a1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=23f67956585f45f9828675343826c09063a5d5b9\n\nI by some miracle scrapped out a green week. However, mentally this week was beyond exhausting. Monday and Tuesday were actually really great days and I had a great time trading. Price action was smooth and premiums paid as expected. However, Wednesday was the worst day mentally and results wise in a while. I could not seem to get a grasp on the technicals for a good entry. \n\nIt seemed by time I was eyeing my play and waiting for confirmation the move happened already. And the times where the move did not happen already I would enter and almost immediately take a 5-10% hit to my position and I would watch SPY move in my direction and my premium lose value. It was the most frustrating thing ever.\n\nThursday really wasn\u2019t much better from a scalping standpoint. But I was able to play some decent level to level plays. \n\nToday I did end up closing red due to my swing calls I played over night. I was expecting PPI to be received bullishly and that did not happen. Outside of my swing my intraday trading resulted in a green day but factoring in my swing I net a red day\u2026\n\nOverall I didn\u2019t find any set ups I really felt confident in. I eyed a few scalps that did behave more as expected but I found that it was much of the same aspect that we were left with super long wicks and extreme volatility on candles that unless your entry was absolutely perfect you got wrecked. Today I played some good L2L plays. The only loss I took was on an L2L put at resistance that had been resistance all day long and then we got that rogue massive push before 11am that stopped me out. I felt playing the levels were better today but it was also still a struggle as it seemed we just pushed from one $1 range to the next $1 range. The technicals which mostly is DMI that I utilize in these L2Ls were also very off and prevented me a few times from getting into plays. \n\nI honestly sat most of the day out and just traded in my head. \n\nLike I said this week was beyond mentally draining and I know many of you struggled this week with this wonky price action and premium pay outs. \n\nIn the end remember this\u2026.\n\nThere will ALWAYS be another trading day\u2026 If you don\u2019t like what you see or it doesn\u2019t fit your strategy then don\u2019t trade. Take the day off. \n\nIf you do not have set rules established for your strategy then you need to establish them now. If you have rules that I need XY and Z to be aligned for me to take a play and you stick to your rules you will succeed. The times we break out rules because of one how one day behaved is the moment you go from a successful trader to a gambler.\n\nNo doubt this price action was brutal today and there is a good chance that Monday is going to suck just as bad\u2026 but there are 252 trading days in a year\u2026 I will not let 3 or 4 terrible days break my rules nor will I let it change my strategy. As long as days like today and weeks like this week you can prevent your drawdown from being unsurpassable (aka walking away instead of continuing to lose) the good days will in the end out weigh the bad days. \n\nHave a great weekend everyone!
