There was talk about pledging some Tesla shares to the banks to reduce interest rates on the loan (because margin loans are the cheapest loans and probably only about 1/2 of what current loan interest is). But I don\u2019t think that new loan happened, because Elon decided to pay off most of the loan by selling Tesla shares. The bottom line is I do not think Elon had a margin call. Also if you logically think about it Elon is still worth many many times any $12 Billion loan so there is no chance of a margin call, not until Tesla drops by 10x or more.

However, Mobileye turned out to be incompetent and risk averse AND probably had nowhere near the technical capacity it claimed to, so the two companies went their own separate ways.\n\nThis caused Tesla to get 5 years behind just from needing to build its own chip from scratch, starting with HW 2, then 2.5, then 3. As it became the leader in neural nets and machine learning, it found that 2D didn't work. So it went to 3D. Then found out that 3D didn't work. So went to 4D. And somewhere in between, it found a way to stitch 2D into a single 3D representation. Then found out that it still needed to reduce latency and get more information per voxel, so it removed post processing. Then it also built an occupancy network for figuring out non drivable areas inferred from visual cues. Then it found out how to reduce processing constraints by dynamically decreasing environment details exponentially with distance to more accurately see closer objects with the computer. All of these things took time to develop, time to figure out that a new method was needed, and time to retrain. \n\nNone of these are \"obvious\" things that Tesla missed at the beginning of the journey.
