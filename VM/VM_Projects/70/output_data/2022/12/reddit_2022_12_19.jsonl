{"title": "Musk Asks Twitter Users to Decide If He Should Step Down", "selftext": "Read a news said that Elon is seeking new investors for Twitter at the same price he paid for it, I was wondering if this guy is trying to pull himself out of this mess he created. [And now I read this](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/elon-musk-asks-twitter-decide-021508126.html)\n\nJust checked the votes, there are 13 million voters with 56.6% YES and 43.4% NO. As a liar who promised not selling TSLA in the future, but repeatedly sold TSLA for accumulatively $23 billion, he has no credibility to me. I don\u2019t think he actually thinks like that, IMO, this is just some tricks he uses to make an excuse and pull himself out of this mess. Besides, if he actually quitted his CEO job of Twitter, it\u2019s probably good news for TSLA as more focuses are shifted to TSLA. Anyway, I am neither holding any TSLA related position, nor a fan of Elon, just want to see how this drama ends. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9hykyrmx0t6a1.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=79f4679cf09d6c979952e5701e527d2f22ab3dcd", "id": "zpksod", "created_utc": 1671433685.0, "score": 103, "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "num_comments": 70, "comments": [{"body": "Elon, keeping the popcorn market afloat.", "score": 103, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4534892439842224}, {"body": "His TSLA sales were your sign not to trust him?
