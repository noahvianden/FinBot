Clutch may be the right word, even if it's not a friction clutch like you'd find on a car or motorcycle.  I suspect the resulting mechanism will resemble a gear shift far more than a friction clutch though- a friction clutch is necessary to match shafts of different speed under load, but there's no reason this would have to shift under a difference of either torque or speed.  \n\nThink about it without the limits of a gas engine.  \nLet's say you're going along at 65 mph and the driver calls for extra regen braking.  You need to engage at speed.  So you can tell the motor controller 'spin up to 11523.625 RPM with little torque' and it will do so.  That can match the rotational speed exactly, and you can match the motor speed to the shaft speed quite precisely- a basic synchromesh can handle whatever difference in speed there is.  And since you're not feeding big amps to the motor, the wheels can easily overpower the motor to get engagement.  When you engage there's essentially zero torque on the joint.  \n\nOnly once the gear is engaged, do you actually start feeding the motor real amperage.  Driver's calling for big regen, so the motor controller steps up the amperage to the windings and now it's bearing actual load (for acceleration or regen).  \n\nThen when this is no longer called for, same thing happens in reverse- motor controller turns down the amps but just matches speed with however fast the truck is going, gear disengages under near-zero load, motor power shuts off.  \n\nResult is no need for a friction clutch.

But this closing just leaves us with more questions than answers. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/406nqzpj7k3a1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=b71a5df550080582915617e3b0861a2a4d6f6b5d\n\nLooking at the zoomed out level here while using yesterdays peak and the peak in January as our new 2022 bear market resistance line we actually are still within the bear trend. With 3 of 4 peaks of this bear market rallies touching exactly on the line. This COULD mean the top is in and we could see a pretty good sized sell off from here on out. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/enm47g7k7k3a1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=485f8bfa37554d74f567956511f529699ad410a7\n\nHowever, when we look at the daily chart zoomed in on a shorter time frame we had lost pre-market that key 405.2 pivot point. But throughout the day the bulls came back in strong and were able to break us through that 405.2 resistance. My thoughts initially in the day was that we would break under 405.2 like we did, come back up and retest 405.2 resistance and reject and break down. This would have to me hinted at a breakdown to 390 next week. However, with us closing back over 405.2 I have to favor the upside next week. However, weekends have a way of changing the dynamic of the markets. \n\nMondays 2022 bear market resistance line resistance come in at 409.5 which is just short of the HOD from Thursday. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8u7r3tok7k3a1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=be19e04bbd540087e5f901aa4c8e2f70d8d870b8\n\nOn the SPY weekly timeframe here you can see that I a few weeks ago highlighted the channel rejection peak and then short peak trend. We are currently in that channel resistance peak and rejection. If we look at the weekly trend line using this weeks peak and Januarys peak 3 of the 4 rejections have perfectly touched this resistance line. \n\nThere is still a case where the \u201ctop\u201d is in of this rally and we could see a rejection and breakdown. The biggest thing im seeing here on the weekly is that we have a clear channel from 390 to 408.5 that we still are trading within. Despite the wick through 408.5 we did not close over 408.5 so that is effectively still resistance. There is a scenario where we could come up on Monday and touch 408.5 while staying within this bear channel resistance, reject and start a retrace back to the 390s. However, with this candle after 3 weeks of trying finally closing over the weekly 50ema and closing our 3rd full candle over the weekly 20/8ema I favor an upside case here. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ydt8fq6l7k3a1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=18e18cc48ccc3a74ea5b77acf29a24e83038e183\n\nSomething some may be over looking is that next week is already the week before FOMC. So we have to factor that into our decisions on what could happen next week. IF we look at the trends from this years FOMCs out of 7 FOMCs\u2026 the week before FOMC has been red 5 out of 7 times for an average decline of -4.14%. This means we COULD see on average a drop to 390.1 (who remembers what level 390.1 is? Hint it\u2019s the major support line of the purple channel we traded in for the last 3 weeks since CPI). However, 2 of the 7 weeks we have had a green day for an average move of 3.26%. This means SPY COULD see on average a pop to 419.9 (does this level sound familiar? It should\u2026 419.5 is the resistance line of the current grey channel SPY re-broke into today). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9yj7fttl7k3a1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=a17034a4affa729b1815b322631d348491cd97e0\n\nSo if we look at the SPY chart here now that we have that FOMC information we have to ask ourselves are we more likely to continue to trend in these rising wedges and touch 419.5 resistance by Friday (which as long as its touched Thursday or later maintains the rising wedge) or are we more likely to break down back into the purple channel and losing the rising wedge support and reconfirm support at the 390.1 level ? \n\nI am pretty torn here. On one hand I really see a case for bulls to run this up into CPI and into FOMC. The bulls have the momentum and after JPOW fluffed the market on Wednesday and being that there isn\u2019t anything crucial data wise and even the unemployment numbers didn\u2019t hold us down all day why should we expect this rally to stop? However, I can also see the markets after running up since Octobers CPI finally peak too. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n57oamam7k3a1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=314f9ca0e0e85f7974a62950e6d2ed3aeb6f5e18\n\nOne last comparison\u2026 if we take the June low to the August peak that rally consisted of 60days and about 19.2% total upwards movement. Currently from the October low to current peak we are looking at 50 days and 17.07%. \n\nIf we believe this is the top\u2026 then If we take the March to June low which was a 21.66% drop over 79days and the August to October drop which was 19.34% over 57days. We COULD expect a drop of 20.5% over 68 days. That means we could see roughly 326 by February 7th 2023. \n\nThe trend could look something like this\u2026. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ekledirm7k3a1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=db9e5e8864bf41a0958f2aad04f4d76ac32341da\n\nSPY has been moving in these up and down cycles all year long. However, we have once again like March and August reached the point of\u2026 \u201cis the bottom officially in?\u201d and the next question of \u201cIs this bear market rally over?\u201d\n\nThe one thing I have said since August (before Jackson hole) is that people need a reason to sell. Think about it like this\u2026 \n\nWe have buyers and sellers. We have retail and we have hedge funds\u2026 some of these were able to buy in or DCA since the 340s and 350s. We also have people who obviously bought at 480 and have bought all the way from 350s to current price. \n\nThink of this as a seller standpoint- If you bought at the bottom or anywhere along the way to current price and we are knocking on the door of possibly breaking out of the bear market and heading to 420 maybe 430\u2026. Why would you sell right now? What REASON do you have to sell? Hint\u2026 you don\u2019t have one\u2026 YET. Now also factor in if you bought anywhere from 400 to 480 you are finally feeling like this MIGHT come back to your cost basis and you MIGHT get out even\u2026 what REASON do you have to sell early and take that loss (outside of tax loss harvesting). \n\nNow think of this from a buyer standpoint\u2026 you have watched this go all the way from 350 to 410 and you know we are hitting near 20% which historically is where most bear market rallies stop\u2026 WHY would you buy here? The reason someone would buy here is FOMO. They think okay we are about to break out of this bear market and rocket to 440 or 450 for the santa rally. However, on the other side you have the smart buyers thinking well FOMC is in one week now and there is a very good chance that could drop us\u2026 imma sit cash. \n\nThis is where we get the range trading like we have from November 11th to November 29th. There really isn\u2019t a good enough reason to buy but there isn\u2019t a good enough reason to sell either. We are left with these low volume low range choppy days. \n\nNow lets factor a few more things in\u2026. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d9pum8zn7k3a1.png?width=666&format=png&auto=webp&s=9915ea13d53b34250fb50a50e500ab260b6e6c07\n\nThe VIX just broke through that key 19.7 level that I have been calling out for the last 2 weeks. Every single peak during this bear market has happened after SPY broke through 19.7. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wwntdplo7k3a1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=6ef8dfd2f1b27a59a9efa7857df8b6e2c174bafc\n\nI do not have the consensus numbers yet for CPI but we do have the Cleveland fed numbers which can give us a ball park. I will do another update on next weeks weekly TA regarding CPI number projections and of course I will post my CPI trade plan and analysis sometime next weekend. \n\nBut if we factor in the CF numbers for CPI with the standard 0.2% +/- variation we could look at the following\u2026\n\nBest case scenario-\n\nCPI YoY= 7.3% (beat 6th decrease in a row)  \n CPI MoM= 0.4% (unchanged)   \n CORE YoY= 6.0% (big beat)   \n CORE MoM= 0.3% (unchanged) \n\nWorse case scenario- \n\nCPI YoY= 7.7% (unchanged)  \n CPI MoM= 0.8% (big miss)   \n CORE YoY= 6.4% (slight miss)   \n CORE MoM= 0.7% ( big miss) \n\nSo when we look at these projections the best case scenario still results in MoM CPI/ CORE remaining unchanged. That will be a huge toss up if the algos will lock onto MoM or YoY as being more important\u2026 \n\nHowever, the worst case scenario if the numbers estimated are low we see that we very well could result in a huge MoM miss CPI YoY for the first time in 6 months not decreasing and CORE once again going back up. This scenario right here in my opinion would result in a -3%+ open and most likely a -5% red day. This would be received extremely poorly by markets. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pha39stp7k3a1.png?width=870&format=png&auto=webp&s=228961034b7c12464b8cbab6ee5d97e53b60963b\n\nThe final thing I wanna touch on is the projected BPS hate hike for the December FOMC. JPOW in November said it was pre mature to decrease rate hikes and slow them, however, at the presser on Wednesday he made it seem pretty clear that we could see our first decrease in rate hikes. This would be a 50 bps hike which is a decrease but really is still a large rate hike. \n\nAfter this many are projecting that we will be followed up with 25BPS hikes\u2026 however, there is a very real scenario even in the best case CPI numbers that JPOW will still stick with 50BPS in January. \n\nMy thoughts are this\u2026 IF CPI misses especially core and MoM on the 13th there is a very real scenario that JPOW will factor that data into the FOMC rate hike and that we COULD get one last 75bps hike. \n\nWhen I said \u201cwhat reason do people have to sell?\u201d Besides some sort of black swan event\u2026 the potential for a CPI miss on the 13th (especially once consensus numbers are released) is enough to sideline money and especially EOW next week (remember CPI is a Tuesday) start taking risk off the table. IF CPI misses big the potential for a 75BPS is going to start a massive dump and if JPOW does a 75bps (or even if he does a 50bps and hints at a 50bps in January ) is going to start a massive dump on SPY and the markets.\n\nHowever, IF CPI comes in good (really need to see MoM decrease and possibly go negative), JPOW does a 50bps AND hints at 25bps\u2026 we are about to get the most epic \u201csanta rally\u201d of the century in my opinion. \n\nMy thoughts are that we do end up somewhere down near 390 and below 405.2 next week by market close on Friday. I do think we could see a repeat of September where we go on another massive rip into CPI only to go on the most impressive dump right after on a big CPI miss. The best play next week is risk off and just playing it as it lies. \n\nMy lines in the same for play to 390 or playing to 419 is if we break through 409 (and close over it) or we break under 405.2 (and close under it). \n\n**$5k/ 10% challenge-**\n\nThis was my best week yet for the challenge. Was able to put in a another 100% win rate on these scalps. I have tactfully made my first scalp of the day which usually comes between 10 and 1030am this play. Through this year even in my bad months the first play of the day for me statistically is the best play of the day and has the highest win rate near 90-95% the last time I checked. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sv4v6pkq7k3a1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f090a04c726346fe668d43047f1e0c5ceb2f07a\n\n**Daily log-** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/syag2c1r7k3a1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6ae5701c47958c97a6dda69b3e07dd67c44ba56\n\nOverall this was a pretty decent week for me. Today I unfortunately snapped a 24 green scalps in a row winning streak with two back to back losses. However, I cant complain much as this was a good week for me. \n\nThis is the 2nd week in a row now that my scalps have outweighed the level to level plays in win rate and profits. I mostly attribute that to the volatility we have been having (which has caused plays to stop out before going green) and also the tight range we have been trading within with low volume and low DTR since CPI. \n\nDespite a green week on tesla and actually a higher win rate than SPY on my level to level plays I am going to retire Tesla out of my plays for a little while. I really enjoy trading it but for the last two weeks now I do not find the risk to reward worth it anymore. I will be focusing on SPY and trading SPY scalps and L2Ls from now on. Which means I will also not be including Tesla in my daily Tas anymore. \n\nHope everyone has a good weekend!", "id": "zazoex", "created_utc": 1670019463.0, "score": 137, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 72, "comments": [{"body": "Not even using charts or TA personally when we get to the point in a rally where I personally feel extreme FOMO set in is when I assume we\u2019ve neared the top.

That, plus the consensus belief in positive seasonality/Santa Claus makes me lean towards a bull case. \n\nOf course there\u2019s the VIX, the fear and greed index, and the potential of tax loss harvesting that keep me from getting levered up to the tits in call options, but I\u2019m not selling off my portfolio either. I think the fact that we\u2019ve closed over that 200sma for 3 days straight is a signal that this rally is different than the one that ended in August. \n\nP.S. glad to see you putting Tesla on pause.
