Yesterday TSLA was down 11.41%, marked the 7th consecutive red days, it\u2019s probably due to the production cut of Shanghai factory in December and January. \n\n[TSLA trading volume daily](https://preview.redd.it/9rz5vxhsem8a1.png?width=722&format=png&auto=webp&s=340ea96c85f70a03efe45735c97f3b7fe751767c)\n\nSince the start of December, TSLA is down 45% with increased volumed after mid-December.

But comparing the cars of TSLA competitors, TSLA cars are not attractive to me, they are not as competitive as it was couple years ago. If TSLA don\u2019t come out with any new models or revise current models to be more competitive to their peers, the sales as well as the price of TSLA are going to decrease as the competition go intense. So personally, I don\u2019t think this 91.52 support is enough to stop the downward momentum, if that support is broken, then the next support I am looking for is around 60.84.", "id": "zx6v36", "created_utc": 1672225350.0, "score": 54, "upvote_ratio": 0.7, "num_comments": 68, "comments": [{"body": "Their cars have always been classic early adopter products.
