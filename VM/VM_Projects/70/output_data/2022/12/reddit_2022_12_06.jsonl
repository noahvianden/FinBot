{"title": "Jamie Dimon says inflation eroding consumer wealth may cause recession next year", "selftext": "JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said that inflation could tip the U.S. economy into recession next year.\n\nWhile consumers and companies are currently in good shape, that may not last much longer, Dimon said Tuesday on CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk Box.\u201d Consumers have $1.5 trillion in excess savings from pandemic stimulus programs and are spending 10% more than in 2021, he said.\n\n\u201cInflation is eroding everything I just said, and that trillion and a half dollars will run out sometime mid year next year,\u201d Dimon said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re looking out forward, those things may very well derail the economy and cause a mild or hard recession that people worry about.\u201d\n\nThe veteran JPMorgan CEO began to raise concerns about the economy earlier this year. In June, he said he was preparing his bank for an economic hurricane on the horizon, in part because of the Federal Reserve\u2019s reversal of bond-buying programs and the Ukraine war.\n\nAdding to pressure for borrowers, the Fed\u2019s benchmark interest rate is headed to 5%, Dimon noted Tuesday. That rate \u201cmay not be sufficient\u201d to subdue inflation, he added.\n\nDuring the wide-ranging interview, Dimon called cryptocurrencies \u201ca complete sideshow\u201d that is rife with criminality and said globalization was in the process of being partly reversed as supply chains are restructured amid heightened geopolitical tensions.\n\nDimon, 66, has led the New York-based bank since 2006. Under his leadership, JPMorgan became the biggest U.S. bank by assets as it weathered the 2008 financial crisis, its aftermath and the 2020 coronavirus pandemic.\n\nWhile the prospects for the economy may be dimming, the banking industry will be able to withstand a cycle of higher loan defaults, he said. That\u2019s in part because of the new capital requirements imposed on the industry after the 2008 crisis.\n\n\u201cThe American banking system is unbelievably sound in a million different ways,\u201d Dimon said. \u201cOur capital cup runneth over.\u201d\n\nFull article: [https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/06/jamie-dimon-says-inflation-eroding-consumer-wealth-may-cause-recession-next-year.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/06/jamie-dimon-says-inflation-eroding-consumer-wealth-may-cause-recession-next-year.html)\n\nJPMorgan (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon says \u201cInflation is eroding everything I just said, and that trillion and a half dollars will run out and it \u201cmay very well derail the economy and cause a mild or hard recession sometime mid year next year.\u201d Do you agree?", "id": "ze7iqh", "created_utc": 1670335209.0, "score": 112, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 72, "comments": [{"body": ">as it weathered the 2008 financial crisis\n\nLmao.
