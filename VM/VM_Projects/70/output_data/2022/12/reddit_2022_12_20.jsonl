{"title": "Common misconceptions: Quality issues, lack of colors, outdated designs, price increases, slow to introduce models, long wait time, expensive, not enough range, better alternatives coming.", "selftext": "These are all the stuff people complain about when they respond to any Tesla or Elon related posts.  First of all, I think Elon needs to stfu for the sake of TSLA investors and salvage his reputation and I get why there are so many haters.  However, the cars are some of the best cars one can own.\n\nI made a list of the most common complaints that people have about Teslas and EVs and why they\u2019re wrong.  I owned/leased multiple cars in my life and the M3SR+ and MYP are some of the best cars I\u2019ve ever owned.  Are these cars for everyone?  No.  Each person has their preferences and I can\u2019t speak for everyone but I do want to point out the most common misconceptions I see every day.\n\n\nHere\u2019s my take: \n\nQuality issues -  when new models come out there are definitely quality issues, especially during the end of quarter rush.   Quality has gotten way better and most \u201cpanel gaps\u201d can be corrected upon picking up your car or with 1-2 stops at the service center.  It\u2019s really not that big of a deal with much better it is compared to other ICEs and EVs. \n\nLack of color options - they offer a few colors to help them scale their production.  You can always wrap your car for $2000-2500 if you love the attention and feel the need to stand out.\n\nOutdated designs - the model S and X have been around for a while and people who know Teslas can tell the subtle difference between the older and newer models.  I personally like it and as a owner of the car would prefer not to fall into the update cycle every 4-6 years that make you feel like your car is outdated.\n\nPrice increases - in the last two years everything got more expensive.  Tesla raised prices to maximize profit and to accommodate the rising material cost.  It sucks that some of us didn\u2019t get to buy a $50k model Y, an $80k model S, or a $100k model X.  Prices are where they are today and everyone pays the same price.  In the last two years almost all auto makers raised prices, on top of that dealerships would mark up cars however they like and then try to get you with their financing and extended warranty.   Nowadays I\u2019m still seeing people comparing sticker prices without considering the dealer markup.\n\nSlow to introduce new models - Tesla doesn\u2019t need to introduce a cheaper model while they are still selling all the cars they can make.  At some point they will be pressured to make a smaller and cheaper model, but an entry level model at $47k with a $7k rebate is pretty reasonable.  A new Prius (slick looking) is $32k but it\u2019s a hybrid after all.\n\nLong wait time - not so long now and will continue to decrease as production increases.\n\nExpensive - for everything such as over the air updates and improvements, saving time from going to the gas station, virtually no maintenance, and cost of gas, it\u2019s really not that expensive.  All teslas come with an awesome panoramic roof, sensors all around, and sentry mode.  Also, the built in GPS makes it a very poor candidate for thieves.\n\nNot enough range - I\u2019ve had two Teslas in 3 years and I\u2019ve used the supercharger 5 times.  It seems like everyone replying to Tesla and EV related posts are driving 300 miles a day.  If that\u2019s the case getting an EV will save them a ton of money on gas and wear and tear.\n\nBetter alternatives coming - yah they are getting better. If you like other EVs go for it.\n\nDid I leave anything out?\n\n\nEdit:   If you don\u2019t mind please share the following:\n\n1.  If you own a Tesla, an EV, or something else:\n \nI\u2019ve had a 2018 Model 3 and have a 2022 Model Y.\n\n2.  Are you a TSLA bill, bear, or don\u2019t care?\n\nI\u2019m bullish on Tesla in the long run.\n\n3.  Where you are getting your information.\n\nMy opinion come from owning the cars for several years and have a lot of friends who also drive and enjoy their Tesla/EV ownership.\n\n4.  Where do you live?\n\nSouthern California where gas and everything else is expensive.", "id": "zqflcj", "created_utc": 1671514147.0, "score": 19, "upvote_ratio": 0.63, "num_comments": 78, "comments": [{"body": "I think Tesla is still in another league when it comes to software.

I was frustrated with their crappy infotainment software, horrible wannabe autopilot, and they were very slow compared to a MY/3.\n\nAnd on the financial side, these cars do not have the margins Tesla does.  Ford had to halt production of the Mach E because they were actually losing money on each car sold due to part price increases.  It\u2019s tough to know for sure since these manufacturers combine revenues of all models into one earnings report, but the consensus is that nobody has EV margins even close to Tesla.  The only caveat to that may be the 100k+ Porsche/Mercedes models, but those are sold in very low numbers.   Rivian is still hand building cars, and the ramp up is never going to happen.  BYD can\u2019t make it out of China, they won\u2019t meet most countries safety requirements.

I think what you *mean* is they don't include it in their Cost of Goods Sold (ie gross automotive cost). This is true - they don't. However, if you add the *entire* R&D spending to the COGS, Tesla's margins are *still far higher than most other brands*. **You're wrong that Tesla's margins are only higher than the competition because they exclude R&D from gross margins.** Keep in mind that Tesla's R&D encompasses far more than their automotive R&D - it includes work on megapacks, solar, Dojo, Optimus and more, which all have nothing to do with their automotive product and thus wouldn't be in Automotive COGS even if R&D was in COGS.\n* Tesla's profits mostly come from China because China is the largest auto market in the world.  It is good that Tesla is able to reach into that lucrative market. This is not a valid criticism of the company. Additionally, Tesla is **not** only profitable in North America due to \"carbon credits\" (ie, regulatory credits). In fact, regulatory credits make up only 2.2% of their trailing twelve month revenue and only 13.1% of their trailing twelve month income before tax. Furthermore, Tesla buyers currently do not qualify for US Federal income tax credits, which puts them at a $7,500 pricing disadvantage compared to several other BEV makers. This will change in Tesla's favor in beginning in 2023 through at least 2032, when the Inflation Reduction Act goes into effect and Tesla buyers will be eligible for $7,500 credits again on purchases of sedans under $55,000 (ie some Model 3 versions) and SUVs under $80,000 (ie Model Y). **So, subsidies in North America are 1) not material to Tesla's model and 2) actually an advantage, not a negative.**\n* Finally, Tesla's relentless growth model is going to drive very strong earnings increases next year, when their profit should increase from around $13B in 2022 to somewhere around $25B in 2023, setting up Tesla to potentially challenge Toyota and VW as the most profitable automaker in the world.

{"title": "The Great Monetary Musical Chairs", "selftext": "**TLDR; Japan is one of the largest exporters of capital in the world. As Japan's interest rates rise, Japanese investors are incentivized to keep their cash in their pockets. This serves to strengthen the Yen and weaken foreign assets. I believe that this attempt at controlling yield will be adopted by many other countries, including the US, in the coming months.** \n\n***SUAV (shut up asshole version); Japanese investors used to like spending money outside of Japan. Now Japanese investors will like to save money in Japan.***\n\n**HISTORY**\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9n2itvupy17a1.png?width=730&format=png&auto=webp&s=2614eebef0715803cf7f11344d820d07333c1a56\n\nAbove is a chart of Japan's historic interest rates. As you can see, they have been just about as dovish in their policy as one can be with interest rates near, or at, zero for the past two decades. The exceptions are exemplified during times of economic crises per 2000 and 2008 data. This dovish interest rate policy came on the tailwinds of massive and continuous QE that eventually ***led the BoJ to own over 50% of the Japanese government bond market.*** In 2016, the BoJ shifted to utilizing yield curve control measures to suppress the 10-year yields to ensure that the bond market remained liquid and solvent. \n\n**So why does this matter?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lu1tcqxq027a1.png?width=763&format=png&auto=webp&s=5616818398d8356726184be14181c34c3c742dd8\n\nRecently, Japanese investors have taken over the top spot as the largest exporters of capital to the US. Funds utilize interest rate differentials to determine viable investment opportunities and have clearly seen the US as the most profitable venture until this most recent announcement.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jqyyr2jd127a1.png?width=1207&format=png&auto=webp&s=e9b4abde0cd230f2f1bceeec901ec579c02892ff\n\nJapan is also the largest holder of US treasuries in the world at over $1 trillion in securities. This is because yield differentials were positive, and were a convenient method of offsetting USD/JPY currency hedge risk. On average, investors could typically see a consistent 100-150 bps return on these investments which was much better than simply holding domestic bonds (you can learn more about this pairing [here](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/09/japanese-yen-us-treasury-bonds.asp)).   \n\n**This system, however, changes entirely when yield curve control measures widen the spread of rates to -0.5% and 0.5%.**\n\nInvestors in Japan are now incentivized to **keep their money in Japan.** Referencing the Japan/US foreign investment charts earlier, your imagination can run wild with how this will affect the US treasury market and Japan's foreign divestments. A selloff of US10Y securities will push yields even higher, placing greater pressure on the FED and US treasury to take action. The FED is stuck between a rock and a hard place here, as they struggle between remaining hawkish on inflation and attempting to maintain stability in the bond market. **Although markets have been able to fend off volatility in recent months, the implications of the largest foreign capital supply siphoning out funds may slowly chip away at the floodgates.**    \n\nWhile the market has a good track record of pricing in data, there's simply no way of knowing for sure what the impacts will be on current investments. As for me, I believe it's about time to catch up with some old friends; SQQQ, VXX, and UVXY. \n\n***It's been a great game of musical chairs, but the music is about to come to an end.

Some of those things will be inflationary, like reshoring production, at least in the nearterm and with regard to wages in the long term... but it's worse not to have product. At the same time, we need to start engineering ways to reduce the use of material where technology and structural change can't solve the supply chain problem directly (like with regard to energy).\n\nBarring that, we have to accept elevated inflation because the whipsaw effect of national response to changing currency and economy conditions will continually undermine the Monetary-exclusive response.\n\nLots of people miss this conflict because Monetary policy is, for many people, an ideological issue rather than an economic issue, and that's a big problem... because unless we're looking to collapse the global economic order (and we have to consider that some people are because they want to fill the vacuum) then a Monetary policy-exclusive solution is clearly not the answer to getting back to the absurd 2% inflation/cheap money paradigm we've been in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd that's OK... we can exist in a 4% inflationary environment.

We've been \"losing our grip\" on Saudi Arabia, China, India, et al for the past 20 years. You're late to seeing that because you're not paying attention, and a big part of the reason why is that we gave them such extreme access to control our supply chain. Reshoring needs to happen, and that means higher costs for goods to some extent.\n* Kowtowing to states that have their own interests in mind and that have historical hostility with us (Russia and China) is NOT how you gain leverage over them, and our issues with this began LONG before Ukraine. Blaming Ukraine on that is purely ideological and uninformed.\n* This lead you to the absurd idea that inflation means costly assets go up. Our biggest inflationary housing cost increase actually happened when inflation was low, NOT high. That's because higher inflation goes along with higher rates and lower returns on forward balance sheets. If you were right, housing prices should have been restrained post-2008 with 2% inflation... but that's not what happened... and our current housing price incline stems largely from expanse of buying in the late 2020/early 2021 period with housing prices increasing almost 30% in that timeframe while people tried to jump into the squeeze. The past 2 quarters housing only increased by about 5%, with a 2022 target of probably around 10%. So this works exactly the opposite of the way that you think.\n* Same with fossil fuels. The reality is far different than what you think, and if you were thinking with your brain you'd have been able to read between the lines and see that when I say \"solve domestic supply chain issues\" that includes gas and oil. We SHOULD drill more, but this isn't a policy issue. Production is STILL 10% below 2019 benchmarks and many open leases are idle because of energy prices in short term decline. Again, you've replaced rationality and research with your political bias and are just blindly parroting whatever fits your predilections. Oil and nat gas companies are not producing to the extent possible expressly because of Price Discovery. Fossil fuels are, however, a long-term depleting resources. We missed our window to implement renewable energy technologies and buffer our use of fossil fuels, so long-term prices for energy are increasing, which is driving lower production because energy companies know they can get higher prices. This is basic economics and the fact that you don't understand it and are, again, stupidly shilling for the anti-environmental narrative just demonstrates a fundamental lack of knowledge and awareness on your part.\n* 2% inflation is a historical aberration. The average for inflation is 3-4% and wages increase normally (even during the 2% period) at an average of about 5% current dollars, give or take. I didn't pick 4% out of a hat, that's the point where labor is flush and can maintain during normal inflation. Inflation/wages is a mathematical reduction/equilibrium problem. To say we can't sustain 4% inflation is just completely uneducated.\n\nYou don't solve major economic power problems by crashing the strength of your own economy. That has never worked.
