DO YOUR OWN DUE DILIGENCE.\n\nLet's see. Before I go into the future outlook of the company, let's stick with today's numbers and go from there.\n\nThey're producing 8% net margin, during a time of high interest rates, that's good.\n\nPE is 37, back at 2017 levels.\n\nPS is 3.18, lowest since IPO in 2016\n\nPB is 4.17, back at 2017 levels.\n\nPFCF is 15.1, lowest since IPO in 2016.\n\nDebt to Equity is 0.5, which is fair.\n\nROE is at 11% which is not the greatest, but still good.\n\nRevenue is steadily increasing.\n\nAccording to these numbers, Paypal is currently at a price where it's the best time to buy. If you bought in 2018 for whatever reason, you should be inclined to buy more now considering the ratios are even better than 2018 levels.\n\nNow the future outlook (I usually don't bother looking into this if the numbers above are too high. Many people look at this first when purchasing securities which is why people go down so significantly. Numbers should always be looked at first).\n\nIn 2008, amid the global recession, eBay was seeing profits despite the economic downturn. Pull up their 10k report and see the revenue numbers over 2005-2011. Meaning PayPal was also making money. \n\nI expect this time it won't be any different. We are living in a time where people spend 90% of their time on their phone (when they're away from work duh). The future is fintech. The sector as a whole, not just PayPal. But PayPal is so far ahead of the game compared to anyone else. They have more capital to play with to better their service should it ever come down to it. \n\nMy price target was $70, and you can verify this by seeing my post history from half a year ago or more. Their PEG which is an ultimate factor for me, was exactly 1 at $73 per share. It has since changed but it's still pretty close.\n\nHonestly, you're not as screwed as you think you are. Yes, it was dumb to throw all your money into one stock. But at least it wasn't a meme stock. PayPal is honestly a good business with a bright future. Yeah, you didn't buy at a good price (at least for me), but if you can weather the storm and hold (unless you really need it), then you should be alright.\n\nI don't see this stock heading down to $50 or less. But if it does, I'm going even heavier on it.\n\nAgain. That's just me.
