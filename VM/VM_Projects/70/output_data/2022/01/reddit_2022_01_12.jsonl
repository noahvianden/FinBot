I get the risk, and any investment this is where u should start. Addressing risk- Regulatory pressure - META wants regulations and has been calling for it for years. Regulation is actually a positive for them, short of being broken up, which could theoretically still be perceived as a positive that would unlock value. Regulation would enrich the MOAT they already have, creating more regulatory hurdles for new entrants would make it much more difficult for competitors, & META has the scale, finances, and management team to navigate regulation. It would also set the rules, and increase sentiment. Capex - Metaverse spending 10+B/year + increase in head count. Remember when Shopify was increasing office space and headcount at a rapid pace when the stock was $75 a share. This will continue to fuel growth, yes not without risk. I get the sentiment that Metaverse is unproven, But Zuck is a forward thinker like Bezos who typically plan their moves 5-10 years out. Take a look at FB road map from 5 years ago\u2026here we are. The fact Zuck is going all in on Metaverse tells me he is confident the time is right. Meta has a very talented team, and their hardware product roadmap is planning for 5+ years out. The team at this stage has clear optics if the tech is feasible to deliver a solid product. I cant see a near 1 trillion company making a blunder this big without solid foresight. Meta and Apple will be the headlines of \u201822. Meta will be the Android to IOS of the mobile platform. Headlines today, Meta has already poached over 100+ top talent employees from Apple, and Apple is giving unprecedented bonuses upwards 180,000 to engineers. They are on defence. Instagram, Facebook, Messenger, WhatsApp, Oculus. A powerhouse of connectivity. Using it leverage as an Ad company, it can target its own audience to support its own ambitions. It can integrate its Apps to create a connection amongst apps in VR that would surmount Apple offerings. Apple detriment to VR is multi fold. 1) it is a premium product, it cant sell 1300 IPhones and sell 300 VR headsets at the same time. To keep the luxury image they are forced to sell a high end unit tethered to their mobile phone (not a true standalone). If they do choose to sell VR at a loss, they are doing so defensively where as META is selling offensively. 2) Market penetration - Apple is a walled garden with a premium price. META worldwide penetration will be far superior to Apple, this will create a more immersive platform. Once VR expands into fitness and education and industry, price point matters. iPhone is already a 2 year cycle, ppl will not spend 1300 on a IPhone, and a 1000+ on VR every 2 years. Apple will have to succumb to pricing pressure, or risk tarnishing their brand. Meta will sell a quality product at a cheaper price, with ad engagement, which will actually spur a healthier community allowing a more democratized e-commerce platform in VR. Meta spending 10+ billion a year over 3-4 years for proof of concept stage IMO is not that big of a risk. Zuck is the roundest founder led CEO left of FAANG, and has the proven track record, and support of shareholders to take this risk. Oculus sales over X-mas, and Vr develpors sales over X-mas are very promising so far. Once VR reaches \u201cx\u201d amount of DAU/user base, the social aspect of VR will kick in, and word of mouth, along with referral incentives will rapidly increase users. Brand Image - Rebranding to META is 2 fold strategy IMO. Yes it deflects from whistleblower issues, but this is not the reason for name change. The name change was a genius move by Zuck to increase awareness of VR before X-mas that likely help spur blowout sales. If you look at the family of Apps, sentiment varies greatly amongst them, with WhatsApp being the most trusted. Facebook name is seen as a tax on the stock, and a slight increase in multiple valuation may result from minimizing this \u201ctax\u201d. META is shifting greatly to increase privacy, this wont happen over night, but they are making significant progress. I wont comment much more on that here. Risk- Competition - Competition spurs innovation. As long as META is able to adapt and have their finger on the pulse of the public I am all for competition. Reels has likely been exceedingly successful,as Adam Mosseri has said they are doubling down on video integration on Insta. Now to get to the Tailwinds:\n1) Metaverse theme\n2) Increasing digitization\n3) Increase in worldwide access to internet\n4) Meta/Jio platforms (10% ownership) in India\n5) Fintech ambitions with WhatsApp (NOVI wallet)\n6) Crypto/NFT integration into platforms\n7) WhatsApp end to end encryption - For a true standalone VR headset, this is crucial. A 2B+ user product that does not require \u201ctext messages\u201d Apples competing IOS to android messaging will require service cell carries, whereas META will have true standalone no text message req.\n8) expanding E-commerce\n9) In house data- centers\n10) partnership with AWS for Metaverse (I\u2019m hoping for Alexa intergration into VR headset)\n11) partnership with Microsoft with Amazon teams.\n12) Haptic VR gloves in the works\n13) strong management team/board (Carmack is an absolute genius)\nIve typed so many fragmented tweets here I dont know where I am anymore lol, but to summarize IMO META has an upper hand to Apple VR/AR ambitions, and the bar is held low for META, whereas Apple P/E 32 the bar is set high. Over the next decade, META will be a juggernaut of scale in software, social, ad, & hardware, ecosystem. The price is very compelling at these levels, & IMO a safe place to park your money over the next 5 years.

The best valued is Amazon. Check elective spending to understand why. This is also why it has such a high PE.\n\nFundamentally speaking, FB has no chance in this arena. You are simply missing the fundamentals of what the metaverse is. **Its a video game**.\n\nYes thats all it is. A video game played in 1st person view with tools to allow modders (aka developers) to add content to the game. This is no different than how we have been modding games for two decades. Many games offer these tools and recently they even let modders capitalize on their creations. In other words, none of this is new. **Its a video game.** More specifically, this is a open world Sims.\n\nSo now ask yourself, what does FB know about making successful video games? The answer is little to nothing. At best they make phone app level games.\n\nAnother thing people dont seem to know, is that these metaverses already exist. Again they are just games. You can jump into them today if you want to. You dont need to wait for FB or anyone else if all you want to do is hang out with your buddies.\n\nThe other buzzwords have absolutely nothing to do with metaverse.\n\nCrypto, NFTs, blochain, fintech, e-commerce has no impact on making a good metaverse. When you play a game, do you care if it accepts visa directly or via paypal? Why would that impact your enjoyment of a game? It wouldnt. Those things are superfluous. You dont need blockchains (aka linked lists) and NFT to create unique items in a game. We have been doing it for decades.\n\nFinally partnerships will not help anyone make a good metaverse.

Sure, you can call it a video game, but this is a video game that requires special technology to work.\n\nAlso, what we're really talking about is who is going to have the most profitable walled garden in the metaverse? It's basically Apple, Meta, Google and Microsoft.  (people forget that MSFT bet on AR from the very beginning).\n\nMeta is a million miles ahead of everyone in building this walled garden.

Modern games have far better character models.\n\nBut none of it matters because it doesnt make the game any better. The gameplay is what matters and it is a game in the end. How does facial motion make the game play better? It doesnt. Its a 2 minute gimmick.\n\nAlso none of this tech is new. We have had it for more than a decade. It even existed in gaming. The Xbox Kinect can already do most of the those things. Near the end of its life, the Kinect could already detect blinking and fine finger motions never mind full body tracking of multiple people in the space of view. Its all well known there are plenty of free API's for it. FB is not ahead of the curve at all. Not with this at least. The VR headset? Sure.  \n\nWhat happened to the Kinect? It was discontinued due to lack of game support. After the gimmick honeymoon was over, it turned out that there wasnt enough demand for that type of interface in a game. Not that it was bad, in fact my kids play those dance games to this day. But aside from a few fitness and dancing games, no one cared to use it for anything that can be done with a controller. Why? Controllers are more convenient.\n\nBut back to the elephant in the room that you conveniently dont address. It doesnt matter how much money you throw at it nor how great your game looks nor how many new gimmicks you come up with, it always comes back to game play. What is the gameplay in the FB metaverse? Lounging with friends? You can do that now in a myriad of games and some even support VR. All the current metaverses can do that too. Why arent you doing it?\n\nSo we are back to square 1. What does FB know about making games? The answer is nearly nothing. \n\nCertainly not more than Google who just dumped a billion down the drain trying to break into the sector and is still actively pushing to get in. Want to know who of the FAANG has made games and mildly succeeded? We all know about MSFT, but also Amazon. Amazon actually has a game studio and they released a MMO. And guess what? Despite all the money spent and the high profile names, it was a mild success at best. Possibly a failure. I dont know the financials. It looks great, it plays well, they figured out the server problems really quick. And yet... its not popular and losing subs fast. Why? Turns out game play matters more than all that other stuff.

Anyone can do this with a few cameras and some free api's and time. In fact the game engines even provide you with the frameworks (unreal and unity). But this is not actual game play. My students literally made this same setup in college over a decade ago (with some help). Of course their models were low res and they only had about a month to work on it. To fine tune the graphics it would take time but the tech is the same. Its basic tracing. Thats all it is. \n\nIn their case they focused just on body, mouth and eyes and the output was a low res facial scan from only 2 angles (2 kinetics). There are phone apps today that do the same thing. All FB did in this tech demo is add more cameras for more angles and they used a hi-res output. Thats time consuming and looks great but not something you can actually use in a game. We have been able to make realistic models for 20 years now but we cant get them into games because of hardware limitations. Even modern hardware cant handle more than maybe 2-3 such models in rendered real time due to memory limits. And even then, it will have severe game play limits.\n\nThe reality is it will never work in a game because games are fighting for resources and you just blew your wad on rendering a face. This is the same crap game devs did a decade ago when they showed graphics that couldnt possibly make it in a real game to fool people and hype their game. People fell for it and were angry when they received the final product.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGo look at their actual avatars. They are xbox 360 level stuff. Thats what you will get in the FB Metaverse.

People think that it's too risky -- every other post on this sub seems to be someone who has blown up their account \"because of options.\" Or people are skeptical of all the get rich quick types out there claiming to get 10x returns with low investment and no risk. \n\n***When done correctly and with the proper checks-and-balances in place, options trading can be a great way to generate income.***\u00a0There are those who manage to consistently see excellent ROIs trading options while subjecting themselves to relatively low risk (*but never zero-risk like some claim).*\n\n# Quick primer for the uninitiated\n\nThe fundamentals of options trading revolve around **Puts** and **Calls**. With a put, you have the right to sell stock at a particular time for a specific price. On the other hand, a call gives you the right to buy the stock at a particular price at a specific time. \n\nMost people buy stocks hoping the value will increase. Investors, however, will buy puts to reduce the risk of their stock positions declining. *Remember,* ***when stock prices drop, put prices go up and vice-versa***, so constant demand for puts often creates a fear premium.\n\nCall prices don't usually trade at the same high premiums as bearish puts. That's not to say that call prices are bad; in fact, they are generally quite decent. Similar to buying shares, people buy calls hoping that stock prices will go up. There are fewer investors that choose to sell puts, probably because *there is more risk involved with selling puts*.\n\n**You need to sell them!**\n\nSelling options on the stocks in your portfolio, or stocks that you would like to add to your holdings, is a time-tested strategy for increasing your profits and decreasing risk.\n\nWhen you **sell** puts, you have a chance to buy stocks you like at lower prices. When you **sell** calls, you can collect premium while waiting for your stocks to rise in value.\u00a0Both of these trades can generate income for you while reducing your risk.\n\nA lot of jargon gets tossed around about options trading, and may seem confusing, but you don't have to know the technical names for every strategy to benefit from them.\n\nSelling a call against a stock is what's known as a **buy-write**, or sometimes it's known as a **covered call** or an **over-write;** they all mean more or less the same thing, which is selling a call on a stock. With a buy-write, you are buying stock while at the same time selling a call. Whereas, for an over-write or covered call, you are selling an option against stock that you already hold.\u00a0\n\nSelling puts against a stock position is known as a **cash-secured put**. Likewise, a **naked put** is when you sell a put on a stock that you don't already own.\n\n# Examples of how selling options can generate income\n\nConsider the covered call strategy. With a covered call, you can set a sale price when you first buy a stock. So, let's say that you buy a stock for $100, you could then immediately set the sale price at, say, $250. So, in essence, you would effectively be selling $250 in strike calls against that stock to boost your revenue. ***That is to say that you can generate income even if the stock stays flat at $100****.*\n\nOn the flip side, cash-secured puts can be used to generate income while you wait for a desired stock to go down to the price you would like to pay to own it. ***Essentially generating income while you wait for that asset to go on sale.***\n\nThe risks associated with selling options comes in when investors fly too close to the sun. This could be using leverage they can't afford to open the positions, or being tempted by higher premiums to choose short expiry dates and near at-the-money strikes. If the contract goes in the money at expiration, you risk getting assigned (having shares called away or margin calls to purchase the shares you're obligated to buy). \n\nOptions trading may not be for everyone, but it also isn't as scary or complicated as many people think. Trading options can be a great way to make a decent amount of revenue while at the same time decreasing your risk on the stock positions that you hold already or would like to hold.", "id": "s29m3p", "created_utc": 1642003115.0, "score": 148, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 75, "comments": [{"body": "People fuck up all the time because they dont understand the positions they\u2019re taking, or the inherent risk involved with guessing a future value of an investment.\n\nIf it was easy, everybody would be doing it.
