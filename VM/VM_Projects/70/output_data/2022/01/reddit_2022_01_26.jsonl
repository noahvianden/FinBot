The idea is a very good one - sharing good beaten down stocks with the community, so everyone can check the company out and decide for themselves if it's a good investment or not. However in 99,9% of the cases the companies being shared either are the still massively overvalued tech giants that have dropped like 10% and are somehow 'a good deal' despite selling for outrageous multiples (MSFT, META etc. ) or the still unprofitable, highly speculative, highly pumped up companies (PLTR, SOFI etc. ). Either way a conservative investor (which is the only real way to invest and expect returns in the long term) can't find any value in there.\n\nThis would be the point where I give you guys a stock tip that meets my requirements, which would be Prosus.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["meta", "msft"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "AMZN META FB", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["amzn", "meta"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "NVDA", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["nvda"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "STEM", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.12900178134441376}, {"body": "SQ is incredibly oversold right now", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.09280002117156982}, {"body": "intel!!!!!

{"title": "SPY crash incoming", "selftext": "What's up WSB.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, the SPY has been irrational and no one truly knows what direction it's going to take except for maybe Nancy Pelosi. I present to you my very amateur technical analysis. Am I wrong? Probably. Are you reading this anyway? Yes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, some of you are gonna call me crazy.  And you're probably right! Why do I think it's going to crash? Stay tuned and I'll tell you why.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy thesis here is based on the price action the last few days. The last time the price dipped below the 260 day moving average on the daily chart was during the crash of 2020 in March. You may be asking yourself \"But Harryp0thead, why the 260 Day MA?\". The answer to that is simple. There are 260 Business days in a year, therefore, it is the yearly moving average.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBack to my thesis.  [My first chart](https://imgur.com/dR5B4wa) shows the daily chart action. I traced over the 5 day MA of the 2020 crash and placed it over the current price action. Fits like a glove. Also shown are the 260 and 26 day moving averages. [My second chart](https://imgur.com/iz9rQxk) shows the 30 minute price action. Once again, the indicators fit like a glove. The March crash was bailed out by the fed printing money and we may finally be seeing the crash as it was meant to be.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you look closely and we are to believe that the chart can/will behave the same way, we will be trading sideways to the end of January. Is it possible that we dip or rise before that? Of course it is! I believe this sideways trading is a bull trap before the market de-leverages and corrects from the fed going brrrrr for far too long.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTherefore, I am of the belief that the price movement is going to depend on what the fed does in the coming days/weeks. Does the fed decide to continue printing money? SPY goes brrrrrrrrr. Does the fed decide to taper off and raise interest rates? Spy goes \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow far down will the SPY go if it crashes? Like I said, no one knows except for maybe Nancy Pelosi.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR\n\nSPY Goes \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b if the fed raises interest rates and turns the printer off.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTHIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE", "id": "scxz7g", "created_utc": 1643173603.0, "score": 70, "upvote_ratio": 0.77, "num_comments": 75, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 61, "replies": [{"body": "[One](https://i.imgur.com/c17xAeM.jpg) of [Two](https://i.imgur.com/3D4WisV.jpg).

Building a more efficient car factory is a good example of creating sustainable value. If inflation is too high than your costs become unpredictable and planning, negotiating, and getting paid get very complicated. Say you sell a car during runaway inflation, normally you would use the proceeds to build another car or invest in an improvement but while the car was sitting on the lot the parts for it doubled in price so you can't continue to invest your revenues in creating one value.  You want inflation to between those two points. \n\n\nModern US economists believe that is a between 2 and 7% in the current Era. Innovation and new markets can change these numbers over time for example computers have made some types of innovation very low cost but high value as you can write software to replace expensive people and machines. 3d printers are some manufacturer ingredients much easier so it's easier to get a return and that is why in modern time the low end of inflation has gotten lower as it takes less incentive for people to risk on big returns. \n\nBasically you want inflation high enough to encourage investment to beat it but not so high that invest doesn't work. The greatest fear is an inflation spiral which is a rare event and takes some special circumstances to happen. It's when trust in getting paid enough for your goods to be able to spend it on what you need either due to shortages or price hikes turns into viscous cycle of escalation.
