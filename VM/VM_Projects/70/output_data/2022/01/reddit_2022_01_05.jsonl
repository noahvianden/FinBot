Having such a large float, a large portion of the stock shares trade in funds like anchor and retirement funds where people buy it for income generation. Intel's not going to sacrifice that, because if they reduced the high float to generate a supply issue in the face of rising demand, they risk getting sold off from funds that have held their shares for a long time... if they don't, then they have a regular stock value drawdown and are traded by funds with an expected lower return rate. Those funds are trading on volume and know INTC has a near ceiling around the 60-70 mark. Stocks with lower floats are more volatile, and anchor/income/retirement funds prefer regular income padding.\n\nThat's why it sells off when it approaches those marks. Those are the profit-taking zones where funds have a motivation to sell a portion of their shares, and that forces the price down creating a new entry point after a sell-off.\n\nIt's not really a question about fundamentals or prospects for any of these companies.
