{"title": "So who are you??", "selftext": "Happy Weekend! Since we could all use a break from looking at our portfolios, here are the people I see on r/stocks. Who are you and who am I missing?\n\n\n**Severe Denial OP**: Often found posting manically during any downturn. They want reassurance they are making the right moves, but they know they own all risky stocks.\n\n\n*\"Guys, this is the opportunity of a lifetime. Now is the time to buy TDOC. This complete collapse is GOOD. We'll never see it this low again!\"*\n\n\n**The Fake Vet OP**: When there is a red day, you will often find this OP. They are secretly falling apart, but they don\u2019t want you to see it, so they play the expert to make themselves feel better. They also love the karma for being the first to make a \u201cDon\u2019t panic sell\u201d post.\n\n\n*\"I've been in the market for 5 YEARS. Just buy and hold and don't look at your portfolio. Go for a walk. Go get some air, it's all good.\u201d*\n\n\n**The Real Vet**: This is the OP who actually has been in the market for 30 years. They mostly just lurk, but when you\u2019re freaking out, they\u2019ll jump in to assure you that they have been through a million crashes and everything worked out fine.\n\n\n*\u201cI lost my house in 2008. I lost my job, my family, my dog, but I just consistently put money in and it worked out. You can do it. Just make a plan and stick to it.\u201d*\n\n\n**Is It Too Late to Buy OP**: This OP is usually a newbie afraid to enter the market at the wrong time, but they also don\u2019t want to miss out. When a stock rises 20% in a week, they will be posting.\n\n\n*\u201dNVDA just rose 20% but is it still a good time to buy??? Will it crash soon? I was waiting for it to crash, but it just keeps going up.\u201d*\n\n\n**\u201dIs Now a Good Time to Buy OP**: This OP is the same as above, but it\u2019s the flip side of the coin. After NVDA rises 20%, it will go down 7% and then this OP will come out.\n\n\n*\u201dIs now a good time to buy? It finally went down, but will it go down lower? I may just wait.\u201d*\n\n\n**The Lost Boglehead**: Bored of talking about index funds with other Bogleheads this OP will head to various stock subreddits. When someone says \u201cWhat do you think will be the best stock this year?\u201d they will reply \u201cVTI\u201d\n\n\n*\u201dJust get VTI. You sound like you don\u2019t know what you are doing. Did you know most hedge funds LOSE money? I know this isn\u2019t the advice you want to hear, but just by VTI.\u201d*\n\n\n**The Persecuted GME OP**: This user wants to talk about GME but also wants to make sure you know they are angry they cannot talk about it more.\n\n\n*\u201dDid anyone else see that the stock that cannot be named went up 9% today! Seems like that\u2019s something we should be talking about, right??? There is a real bull case for this.\u201d*\n\n\n**The Bitter Bull**: The bitter bull will mostly lurk but will sometimes comment \u201cJust keep buying\u201d under someone else\u2019s comment. But once a big green day comes, they just have to post about how they knew it would all work out.\n\n\n*\u201dI TOLD YOU! Just buy! It always goes up. You guys were laughing at me last week when I said to buy AMD. Don\u2019t time the market. Just buy.\u201d*\n\n\n**The Bitter Bear**: This is the worst kind of poster on the subreddit. Anytime a stock goes up, they will be there to tell you it\u2019s going to go down. When you are excited, they need to tear you down. When the market takes a turn for the worst, they are there to rub it in your face and mock your optimism.\n\n\n*\u201cLet it bleeeeeeed. My puts are printing. Down down down down we go!\u201d*\n\n**So who are you?
