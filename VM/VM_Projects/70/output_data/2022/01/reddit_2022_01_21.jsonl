{"title": "Rates near local highs - Yield Curve collapsing - Recession?", "selftext": "What is everyone's take on a recession coming and fast?\n\nHistorically there are some excellent indicators that almost always precede recessions.\n\nA few of them are the title of this thread. Additionals are that the dollar is rising (global recession, money is flowing into the US like a giant sinkhole because the rest of the world is imploding, too) and worse, Gold is rising.\n\nGold is near a top and won't come down. The reason this is bad is because rates are higher, so the \"real rate yield\" should be lower - assuming inflation is staying the same or decreasing.\n\nFor Gold to be going up means someone feels the pressure of inflation. Negative real rates are increasing, not decreasing, in spite of the rising rates.\n\nWhat happens when the FEDs have to take the 3-months and spike it by 25%? God forbid 50%?

What are some companies you\u2019ve identified with minimal debt and strong dividends?", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "I\u2019ll clarify a bit what I look at re: dividends and debt. While I\u2019m happy to take a dividend, I\u2019m not chasing div yield specifically. The dividend is like  an insurance policy for a worst case scenario where the stock goes too low for me to sell covered calls, or call buyers exit the market - at least I\u2019ll have *some* cashflow coming in from the position. What I\u2019m really looking at on yield is shareholder yield: the combination of div yield, buyback yield, and debt reduction yield. What I especially don\u2019t want to see is a company paying for its div yield by increasing debt.\n\nOn the debt front, I borrow from Peter Lynch and compare cash + current assets to long term liabilities. Lynch\u2019s position is that most companies will reliably cover their current liabilities (debt due 1yr or less) through normal operations. If I see cash + current assets greater or equal to long term liabilities, I infer the company could essentially eliminate its debt at any time and is using leverage effectively. A quick search on Moody\u2019s tells me how the company\u2019s debt is graded; I\u2019m comfortable so long as it\u2019s deemed \u201cinvestment grade.\u201d\n\nSo, current positions I\u2019m not ashamed to share are below. I\u2019m trading a $5200 account, so I\u2019m very limited by share price.\n\nLong SWBI at 17.5 - rolling short puts until forced assignment. I think the stock\u2019s fair value is above $25. Management has been buying back shares by the boatload (20% yield), and they have just $53M in debt vs $159M cash + $334 current assets. That\u2019s right: their long term liabilities are covered 3x with cash alone. That company is not going bankrupt anytime soon. Wrap that with a 62% ROA (81% unlevered!) and I\u2019m not concerned about their ability to compete regardless of market environment.\n\nAnother one I\u2019m trading is ET at $9, with a fair value target above $12. The debt picture isn\u2019t as strong here, but management has been paying down debt aggressively and in turn growing free cash flow. They own a lot of oil pipeline in the US, and we\u2019re not giving up that addiction anytime soon.\n\nI don\u2019t have a position in WU right now but have traded it recently and would be comfortable going back in if buying power allowed. It\u2019s at $18 and I put fair value above $25. Cash + current assets are about par with long term liabilities. The shareholder yield is nice: 5% div yield + 5.6% debt reduction yield + 3% buyback yield. The company\u2019s close to 200 years in operation (founded 1851) and doesn\u2019t have much in the way of competition; WU solves the \u201clast mile\u201d problem of their portion of the market.

Inflation. And then fear of rate hikes to cool down inflation. Are there going to be 2 hikes, ok maybe 3, or maybe 4, or maybe we are just going to go full 2008 and crash the economy !!\n\nWhy is inflation going up? Fed is printing too much money. People have too much money.\n\nSo we need higher rates.\n\nBut if the rates go up, and if people have less money, and as a result the assets prices will start correcting, inflation will come down or even be negative, and the need for 25 rate hikes (as feared by people, and a rhetorical number) will not exist, and we will probably end up with only 2-3 rate hikes.\n\nThink of a dude in Bay Area who worked at NVDA who was planning to buy a house for 4M by selling his stock at 350. Now 1) with higher rates and 2) lower stock price, he can't. The prices have to come down.\n\nBut what about the guy earning 20 dollars buying milk. I think the same calculation applies everywhere - they guy earns only 20 dollars, but his friends with stocks will spend less on vacations, look for lower rentals because they can afford only so much, and in some cases even spend less on groceries (people on fixed income can spend only so much - social security or I-Bonds are not going up at 20% per annum), so a price stabilization has to come to even low dollar items too.\n\nWill the dollar store go back to $1 instead of $1.25? Maybe not, but (if I did micro adjustments), it will not be surprising if they went to $1.11 :)\n\nAnd when prices come down and this is the game that will be played for next few months - Fed will not hike. The Fed has to have a credible threat of hikes to kill the hyperinflation but once they are convinced it is killed, why would they continue to hike? But it is a 2 way game ... Fed gives up its threat and SPX goes to 5000, 6000, 10000 - that can not happen, so this battle will continue until inflation readings are what they expect them to be.\n\nThe game has already changed. We are just looking for the new balance, and I think the end is near than the fear would indicate.\n\nBTW, take a look at the weekly charts of stocks you burn theta on. If they show a parabolic/exponential rise, please manage your risk way more tightly than you do on other trades, or better do not get into them at all. I was laughed at in this thread (and others) when I pointed out our favorite tech companies were in parabolic mode, but parabolas on hourly and daily is one thing, parabolic rise on weekly and monthly - that calls for extreme caution: [https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/r1i5u4/selling\\_a\\_covered\\_call\\_to\\_exit\\_long\\_term\\_position/hlyv8wi/](https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/r1i5u4/selling_a_covered_call_to_exit_long_term_position/hlyv8wi/)\n\nJust one simple change - you can write put on a down day or whatever, but not when the stock is in a parabola and corrected 2% after going up 200%.
