{"title": "U.S. home builders less optimistic due to high inflation and supply woes", "selftext": "High inflation and persistent shortages of key supplies dimmed the optimism of U.S. home builders early in the new year. The National Association of Home Builders\u2019 confidence index slipped 1 point to 83. \n\n**Key details:** A measure of customer traffic at homes for sale fell a few points in January, as did a survey of sales expectations six months from now.\n\nThe biggest drop took place in the Northeast, where the omicron outbreak has been the most severe and the weather has been harsh.\n\n**Big picture:** Demand for housing has been strong, but rising prices and higher mortgage rates could turn off potential buyers. The survey was taken during the first half of January and did not fully include the recent jump in mortgage rates. Even bigger obstacles are ongoing shortages of labor and supplies as well as higher costs for materials such as lumber. The NAHB said the cost of building materials has surged almost 20% in the past year. \u201cPolicymakers need to take action to fix supply chains,\u201d said NAHB Chairman Chuck Fowke, a custom home builder in Tampa, Fla.\n\n**Looking ahead:** \u201cWhile lean existing home inventory and solid buyer demand are supporting the need for new construction, the combination of ongoing increases for building materials, worsening skilled labor shortages and higher mortgage rates point to declines for housing affordability in 2022,\u201d said NAHB chief economist Robert Dietz.\n\n**Market reaction:** Home-builder stocks such as Lennar Corp. LEN, -5.41%, Toll Brothers Inc. TOL, -4.20% D.R. Horton Inc. DHI, -4.65%  and PulteGroup Inc. PHM, -3.58%  all fell sharply in Tuesday trades.\n\nThe S&P 500 Index  SPX, -1.63% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -1.47%  also declined. Equities have deflated lately owing to the prospect of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates soon.\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/u-s-home-builders-less-optimistic-due-to-high-inflation-and-supply-woes-11642518358?mod=mw\\_latestnews](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/u-s-home-builders-less-optimistic-due-to-high-inflation-and-supply-woes-11642518358?mod=mw_latestnews)", "id": "s714eo", "created_utc": 1642522552.0, "score": 93, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 70, "comments": [{"body": "Rising costs to build homes will only drive up existing pricing even further.", "score": 34, "replies": [{"body": "Agreed, yet there is a point where people won\u2019t be able to afford higher costs and may revert to existing home sales since they are lower cost.

The more and larger proportion of the price that's borrowed, the higher the interest rate, and you have to pay PMI with less than 20% down.\n\nLess certainty in financing plus lower tolerance for an appraisal gap means the offer could fall through after acceptance, so sellers have a strong incentive to go with cash-heavy offers. On my house, we actually didn't have the highest offer, but having a full down payment and offering appraisal gap coverage meant we were more likely to complete the sale.\n\nI'm sure you could demonstrate that you're choosing a small down payment for reasons other than being cash-strapped, but if a small down payment is the only you can buy the house, the light cash position can become a liability.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Ok that makes sense, I've been putting offers in for over a year now and starting to think it might be because I'm using the Naca program that none of them are getting accepted.

Here is in detail.\n\nI've been on this sub almost year, one of those who a meme stock attracted and I knew pretty much nothing.  Since then, made some gains, made some losses, slowly declining until I was over 50% down. I traded pretty much every meme through August though only in piddly amounts, a few shares at most (Robinhood is my play account, I do most of my serious investing in Fidelity) and more or less staying even through most of 2021.\n\nOver time I found the real DD was in the comments, how to ignore the pumpers and dumpers, even read a book or two on options and trading. Lots of youtube videos too.\n\nAugust I started trading SPY calls and had some successes with small amounts of safe calls.\n\nI get cocky and buy 30K in SPY short expiration calls at the end of August, and September 2021 hits my port very hard. I sell for a loss, and had been clawing my way back up to break even, when I saw the news about ATVI's scandal and the stock dropped. I had sworn not to gamble on individual stocks anymore or FD's or expiration calls less than 6 months to expiration, but ATVI news for some reason caught my eye.\n\nNovember 3rd 2021 it closed at $66.25 down from a previous $79.29 and for days it stayed down. I decided to buy 1 call on November 16th.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[And regretted it within days.](https://preview.redd.it/nydickqvphc81.png?width=486&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ed66ee41c31a540897b1976f9a3e17c41a8fc61)\n\nI've been addicted to video games since I was a preschooler dragged kicking and screaming by my Dad from his friend's house where I encountered my first Pong game. I figured, they'll do damage control, they are a juggernaut  in the industry, they'll pretend things have changed, the sentiment will change when people get distracted by other things like Theranos and the Ghislaine Maxwell trial. I think the culture does need to change in the industry, but I also figured this scandal would be like demilitarizing Japan. What do their schoolbooks say happened back then?

I canceled the order, thinking, I'm just throwing more money away, then re-ordered it when the markets opened.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Well, if anything, I average down and may make 1&#37; if I'm lucky](https://preview.redd.it/cv6m43ndshc81.png?width=467&format=png&auto=webp&s=fedc958b668a491752eaa9145acf3137477f87a6)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Then I thought: How stupid am I.
