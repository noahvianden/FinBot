If a future is an option where you are obliged to buy/sell, then aren't they prices by the same model?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "A future is not an option. A future is an obligation to engage in a transaction with the counterparty at a certain date at the standardized contract price. An option is an *option* to engage in a transaction at the strike price, as long as you are the buyer of the option (if you sold the option, you lose optionality).\n\nSo say I want to make a contract with a landowner to buy his land in a year, then the no arbitrage price would be the future value of the current land value. This contract price is simple to derive and can not be altered during the life of the contract. If the land is worth $1M, then the contract price would be $1M *e^rT. Ignoring carry costs, taxes etc.\n\nNow let's say I want to hold the option to buy the land in a year, but only if the land value is above $1M (a call option with a strike price of $1M). The landowner obviously wants to be paid a bit of money to reserve the price for a year, so the price we would need to pay the owner is going to be related to the time he reserves it, the range of the value the land could be worth in a year, and current interest rates. So without actually calculating it, let's say the owner wants to be paid $5000 for this option contract. \n\nThe point of this is the futures price is directly related to the underlying price,.

At all.

This is governed by the no-arbitrage principle. There is a strict relationship where if the price of the contract doesn't obey that principle, one of the parties is being treated unfairly in the transaction, and can be taken advantage of.\n\nAn option is the right to engage in a transaction at a certain price, on a certain date. The transaction itself has not occurred yet (as opposed to a future where that is the entire transaction, except for delivery). The option is buying the right to engage in a transaction, not the actual transaction.\n\nHope that helps! I would try to understand the differences between them before using them.

Elaborate on this please.\n\nDo we not pay anything for that agreement? No premium for the seller, just a \"Yes ma bro, sign here and 1 year from now on we will exchange this 1 ton of gourds for the fixed price of 1$/KG\"", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "In a futures contract, we are not paying for an agreement. We are simply saying that both parties want to engage in a transaction, but let's put it off by a year, or some time frame.\n\nLet's say I have a book that you want to buy from me, but I'm not done reading it yet, so I say I will sell you that book in a year. Let's say the price of that book is $10 right now.\n\nSo for me, I am forgoing that $10 now, to get it in a year from now. Let's say the interest rate I could invest that $10 is 1%. (I'm using a book in the example because it doesn't really cost me anything to hold, no dividends or any other messy things).\n\nSo for me, for me to not care whether I sell it today or a year from now, I would say, I'll sell it to you for $11 in a year ($10 *1.01 to account for a year of interest on the ten dollars). So the futures price is $11, while the spot price is $10.\n\nNo matter what happens, you are giving me $11 to buy the book from me in a year. \n\nWhat happens if this price is not $11? If it is above $11, say $12, someone could sell the contract for the expensive price, buy the book by borrowing $10, then at maturity, they would pay back the $10+$1 of interest, and would receive $12 from the contract, netting $1, by essentially taking no risk.\n\nIf the price is below $11, say $10, someone could short the book for $10, invest the proceeds for a year at 1%, and buy the futures contract. At maturity, they would get $11 from investing at 1%, buy the stock back at $10, and again, have netted $1 with essentially no risk.\n\nFutures are governed by arbitrage, and the formulas is, like I noted above: F=Se^rT\n\nNow, what if you were a reading snob, and figured that if it was a good book, the price of it would go up in a year, so you ask me for the option to buy it a year from now at $10. Well, since I, as the seller, don't really know if you are going to buy it from me, I'll charge you for that at some rate. So that option itself, let's say, is worth $1. So you pay me $1 today for that option. \n\nIn a year, let's say that book is now worth $15, but you still owe me $10 to complete the transaction. So all in, the option you bought was worth $1, and you still owe me $10 to complete the purchase.\n\nBut what about the value of that option over time? (Remember, the option is not the transaction, it is separate).\n\nSay tomorrow, the price of all books goes up by $5. There is a portion of that option that is tied to the books price. So if the price of the book goes up by $5, maybe the option will be worth $2.5 more, so $3.5 total ($1 + $2.5).\n\nBut maybe, the government comes in and says they are going to cap all book sales at exactly $10 forever. Now there is no question what the price will be in a year, so the value of that option decreases, since the volatility is essentially 0.\n\nLet's look at the flip side, and say the government is thinking about regulating the paper industry (but we don't know what regulations they are thinking of.) Maybe they will make paper costs go up, and that book will cost $30 in a year. Maybe they are going to subsidize the paper industry, and that book will cost $5. We have essentially raised the volatility, so the value of the option would increase, since there is a wider range of outcomes.\n\nNo matter what happens, after you gave me that $1, I have to sell you the book at $10 in a year as long as you want to buy it \n\nCompare this with the futures prices. Since the futures price is governed by that simple formula above, we know that if the price ever deviates from fair value, someone could step in an arbitrage it away, with no risk whatsoever.
