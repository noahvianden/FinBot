{"title": "I got a solution for inflation", "selftext": "So first I should inform you guys I\u2019m not an economist. I\u2019m more of what you would call an \u201cidiot\u201d\n\nI believe I figured out how to solve the inflation problem without raising interest rates or tapering. Raise the minimum wage to 30$/hr. This in theory should create mass unemployment. With more people being unemployed that should slow down the velocity of money. \n\nMost people making <30$/hr would support this because they think that means they would get a raise. In reality they would likely get fired because employers would either figure out how to more quickly automate or only keep their most productive employees. I\u2019m actually surprised some jobs even exist or have as many people doing it because is pays so little. The Walmart greater, or cashiers. You don\u2019t need the greeter and self check out already exists but for some stores it currently isn\u2019t worth paying to buy the new machines. If they had to pay 30$/hr per employee it would be worth buying the new machines and just pay 1 employee to watch 4 lanes. This is one example that comes to mind.\n\nWith less people employed, less people with money to buy things, there will be less demand. No more supply shortages, no more labor shortages and we\u2019ll reach equilibrium again. \n\nI figure this would be the best solution since it looks like no one likes raising rates since makes credit more difficult and makes industry less willing to invest in new tech. Plus the government doesn\u2019t want to increase cost of servicing their own debt. Another idea would have been to raise taxes but fuck that. So this idea of causing unemployment through this method would be more palatable to everyone. Plus i think it would give the added benefit of forcing our economy to be more efficient. \n\nWhat do y\u2019all think?", "id": "s07gxk", "created_utc": 1641778409.0, "score": 20, "upvote_ratio": 0.71, "num_comments": 75, "comments": [{"body": "With this much brain power you might be able to manage a Wendy\u2019s by tomorrow", "score": 72, "replies": [{"body": "This could very well lead to an Applebees", "score": 15, "replies": [{"body": "Chili's by Friday.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Whoa easy killer we don\u2019t throw that word around here so easily", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.026784930378198624}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.29704776406288147}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4405478537082672}, {"body": "Or the dumpster behind the Wendy\u2019s\u2026.", "score": 11, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.32516953349113464}, {"body": "No Wendy\u2019s left at 30/h min wage.", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.44576296210289}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.22415977716445923}, {"body": "Sounds like a really poorly worded version of what's probably going to happen minus the wages going up.
