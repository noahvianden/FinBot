This means around 10 billion in profit (25% yoy) with enough growth left for a PE around 20, giving annualized returns around 10% without further stock repurchases which may occur due to good FCF generation, so it can outperforms the overall market if it pulls this off. \n\nThing to watch is their chip supply, which has handcuffed that growth and given Intel more time. The Adler lake chips outperform on desktop but it\u2019s hard to see intel catching up in data center. Adler lake vs Ryzen 6000 in notebooks, Intel has an edge, but the better power efficiency and igpu of Ryzen should keep AMD in the game and continue market share gains. \n\n I own some AMD but sold half in dec due to that, much higher risk, and lower risk premium and better competition from Intel then it has had in the past few years. \n\nIt\u2019s got strong upside, but with it is fairly decent risk.

Coinbase is one of the top 5 most profitable exchanges, of any type, in the world. Coinbase might make more money than Nasdaq. Why I like COIN is that it is a play on Bitcoin *AND* all the other coins out there...whereas bitcoin is just a play on bitcoin, so you are getting all the other coins for free. For now, COIN is heavily (96%) tied to the price of bitcoin, which is very hard to predict but they are rapidly diversifying their revenue streams (NFT marketplace; custody agent for Facebook's crypto Novi wallet and SoFi's crypto offering and others; starting a media arm; crypto derivatives; Coinbase cloud; etc). Another advantage of COIN is it being the first crypto exchange coming on to a major market exhange is that they potentially can use their stock as currency to buy any other competitors. And you don't have to believe in the crypto party line and the dangers of fiat currency and how you need an alternative, because central banks all over the world are printing money like crazy - even if you think this is nonsense, we know that there is a market for this kind of nonsense because gold bugs have been saying the same thing for decades. In other words, crypto has a natural constituency. Like gold, people buy it as a kind of inflation insurance and gold's strength is its scarcity - its supply only increases about 1% per year and it is getting harder and harder to find more - that sounds a lot like Bitcoin to me and I think it is totally legitimate to believe that crypto, in general, can rival gold as a storehold of value. \n\nNextdoor (KIND) - hyperlocal Facebook.
