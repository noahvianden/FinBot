Let me know in the comments.\n\nThis week we gained big by predicting 2 main moves, the drop on the GDP release, we ran on very bad news for Feds, the drop was inevitable. And another big gainer was PCE release, got in PM into SPX calls when i saw Bullish divergence between price action and RSI and added size after PCE meet expectation as it was good news for the Feds and PCE is one of powells favorite metrics to look at for rate hikes.\n\nThe following is basically my plan for next week.\n\n# Major Economic Events\n\n**Monday 10/31**\n\n9:45 AM Chicago PMI\n\n10:00 AM Dallas Fed Manufacturing Index Oct\n\n**Tuesday 11/01**\n\n9:45 AM S&P Global PMI Final Oct\n\n10:00 AM ISM Manufacturing PMI Oct\n\n10:00 AM Jolts Job Openings Sep\n\n**Wednesday 11/02**\n\n8:15 AM ADP Employment Change Oct\n\n2:00 PM Fed Interest Rate Decision\n\n2:30 PM Fed Press Conference\n\n**Thursday 11/03**\n\n8:30 AM Balance of Trade Sep\n\n10:00 AM ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI Oct\n\n**Friday 11/04**\n\n8:30 AM Non Farm Payroll Oct\n\n8:30 AM Unemployment Rate Oct\n\nSo all these are very important events that will move the market, but the offcourse the important event is the Fed Conference on wednesday which is the only event ill playing.\n\nSo my play here is in 2 parts.\n\nPart 1 - The Rate Hike\n\nBelieve it or not the rate hike is not that important and is unlikely to affect the market that much, let me explain.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/owgfdped10x91.png?width=1262&format=png&auto=webp&s=a466d5bcb721e09c65cc449128a726a17b262b77\n\nAs of Friday 28Oct the market is pricing\n\n0% chance of 100Bps\n\n81.3% chance of 75Bps\n\n18.7% chance of 50Bps\n\nNow in my previous watchlist we have been predicting the rate hikes right every single time by just following the highest odds, the Fed doesnt like to freak the market. They also dont want the market to rally too much so its also unlikely that we get 50Bps, in addition to that why do 50Bps when they can get away with 75Bps without freaking out the market.\n\nIn all cases, they definitely not doing 100bps, if they do 75bps as expected we run a little (ill tell why a little later on) if they 50Bps we run alot. It seems to me for the first part the very obvious play here is calls before the rate hike, and sell on the spike for that delicious IV spiked premium.\n\nPart 2 - The Meeting\n\nWell this is where it gets very tricky, so as you may know that market has been rallying lately and thats because alot of people are expecting the Fed to pivot, or at least start talking about pivoting this time.\n\nIf they say we are pivoting the run continues at least till we hit the 200MA on the SPX 1D chart, if they we cant do that yet, we are getting new 52 week lows.\n\nThis part is easy to figure the part is figuring out whether they will pivot or not, for funsies ill give you my expectations, but honeslty im going to play it by ear. Im 50/50 on what they plan to do, and the move will be so big you can get in at time and still make $$, you can also do a straddle.\n\nAnyway Looking at the PCE report inflation is not so bad, thats why ran hard after the report was out, its not the best report in the world, but its an improvement for sure, add to that the St. Louis Fed came out with report stating the Fed is wrong to look only at CPI as it is lagging data heavily weight down with rent prices going up and that if we remove rent, inflation has actually cooled off and we are actually deflating now.\n\nThe fed doesnt want to risk deflation by forcing a recession when we dont really need to. (This is a much worse scenario than inflation, thats why the Fed is being careful)\n\nOn the other hand, GDP came out pretty damn positive, the so called earnings recession and end of the world stock market destruction is nowhere to be seen. While some growth tech companies \u2018\u2019missed\u2019\u2019 (most of them just lowered guidance, they didnt actually miss) most of the not so sexy companies beat. This is good for the stock market, VERY bad for the feds, this means that demand is not getting crushed, and if demand is high, prices will likely remain elevated. So all this might signal to the Fed that job not done yet, we need more pain.\n\nAs you can see there are very good reasons for the Fed to go either way, i think we get a pivot for an important reason no one is really talking about. The US treasuries the most liquid market in the world, is losing its liquidity. With UK and Japan selling US Treasures to prop up their currienses and markets and the Fed tightening and no longer buying assets this is starting to affect the treasuries market.\n\nGuys if treasure market goes no bid or crashes, 2008 + 2001 + Great depression will NOT even come close to the global collapse that we might experience. Central Banks Chairs around the world have been pestering Powell about that recently. I think they will do anything to make sure that doesnt happen.\n\nBut like i said we shall see.\n\n# Earnings\n\n# Tue 1 Nov\n\n**After Close - Advanced Micro Devices ($AMD)**\n\n* Technology/Semiconductors\n* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 4:05 pm EST\n* Estimates: EPS $0.57 & Revenue $6.7B\n* Options pricing in a 12.1% move on earnings\n* My Play: Been in this one for a while, since it reported Revenues and dropped hard but i keep selling because it keeps running.

Going with Nov11 $76 calls, also will likely hold till 1D 200MA is tested  ($110) trimming on the way up\n\n# Watchlist\n\n**- $TSLA Long**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xf5d6mcf10x91.png?width=1488&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0ee3eae96a82cee42fcf3f93488dfd70d3e66a5\n\nIf TSLA continues its run, and finally break the 230 resistance, we can easily see a run to $250 level, will take calls on Monday\n\n**- $SPY Short**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q96wt5pg10x91.png?width=1488&format=png&auto=webp&s=278dc0bbd5025aca467cb822a03603f7ecd7a914\n\nWhether we run or not after FOMC the 1Hr is VERY over extended, and we are due a pullback, its not going to be a sharp one likely but still could make for a nice trade.\n\n**- $PIN Long**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/em2jx6hh10x91.png?width=1488&format=png&auto=webp&s=754fa108ef21a21dc4a22bb0b10c6c4d855fd71c\n\nStrong beat by PINS still has room for more if it breaks the $25.9 resistance we can get $27.95, quickly, taking some call here for a possible run\n\n**- $DB Short**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bt550y5i10x91.png?width=1488&format=png&auto=webp&s=20ba5802ea52e0d4b92c01b6f45dd1e765f2b507\n\nRan so much on that earnings beat, creating a short gap fill to $9.5. Its also very Overbought on the Daily chart making a nice %3 move down at least, picking up some puts as long as it doesnt move down before the open\n\n# Bonus Potential 10 Bagger Play\n\nAlright boys and girls so played this one before as 10 bagger and we got our 10 bag (and then some) But this one has more left in the tank for another run.\n\nIts NFLX baby.\n\nSo we ran hard before and on earnings securing our 10 bag ( This was my firs 10bag call on my first watchlist, check my profile for proof).\n\nNow it crossed the 200MA on the daily chart after filling half the gap so take a little rest. What we are looking for here is for NFLX to reclaims 50 and 21MA  on the 1hr time frame. Once we get we reclaim that we will continue to fill the remainder of the gap fill all the way to $330\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5fgoc8zi10x91.png?width=1488&format=png&auto=webp&s=f20f77fa437d99ebb2baab3facbe3078a58561ad\n\nAlright, so that's it for this week, ill be doing this every week and going through the previous week\u2019s play to see how much we gained and where we went wrong.\n\nIf you have any questions let me know, none of this is financial advice, I wish you all a very green week!", "id": "yhociw", "created_utc": 1667160155.0, "score": 148, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 77, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|9|**First Seen In WSB**|8 months ago\n**Total Comments**|61|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y7chpu/earnings_season_50_major_company_earnings_this/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xbgory/my_full_plan_for_this_week_0912_2_earnings_plays/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xbgirb/my_full_plan_for_this_week_0912_2_earnings_plays/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xhrszm/my_full_plan_for_this_week_0919_2_earnings_plays/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/x6s01x/my_full_plan_for_this_week_5_earnings_plays_2/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yho3e3/my_full_plan_for_this_week_1031_challenge_update/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yhociw/my_full_plan_for_this_week_1031_challenge_update/) \n**Account Age**|10 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=yhociw)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=yhociw)\n    \nHey /u/Flimsy-Willow-3086, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Also, he had coin up as a play initially.
