The decision is pretty easy.\n\n\\- Tesla has loads of pricing power due to very high profit margins\n\n\\- They go from record to record each quarter\n\n\\-  They're (virtually) debt free (unlike all competitors which are mostly 100bn+ in debt).\n\n\\- Vertical integration. The amount of flexibility and first mover potential/advantage that comes with this seems to fly under the radar of most.\n\n\\-  They have the pick of the best and brightest when it comes to hiring (this is probably the major reason why Tesla is going to be successful in the long term. Product 'now' is one thing.
