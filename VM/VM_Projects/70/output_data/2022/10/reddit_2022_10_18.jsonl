(If a person who owns a car uses uber, they think oh man this is expensive. - but if you don't have to pay a car payment, no car insurance, no weekly gas bill, no oil changes or repair costs, uber is not that terribly bad a few times per week. and if more people were using it, AND they didn't have to pay drivers - uber could become much more affordable - especially if the uber(type of company) company owns the vehicles - i just used uber as an example - but the idea remains the same whether the owner of the app/cars is named LYFT or UBER or TESLA-PLUS or whatever the name of the service is eventually called.\n\n\\*(as a side note - edit - part of the advantage here is that Uber/Lyft whatever company doesn't have to own a huge fleet of cars - some one like me could own a Tesla that takes me to and from work each day - but after i get home if I know I'm staying in for the night - i could turn my Tesla over to driver mode and let it go out and do uber runs for a few hours. Uber/Lyft whatever the company is called would get the majority of profit but I would get a nice kickback for providing the vehicle. When it come home at XX time - someone plugs it in to charge \\*(probably me) and then it's ready to go to work for me the next morning.....Or I could have it drop me off at work and not have to find parking, because i could turn my car to driver mode while I'm at work - and boom make money allowing my car to drive while I am at work) \n\nIf the TAAS idea does catch on and become the norm for more and more people then mobileye might never become super profitable because if a company like tesla, or uber or lyft has their own self driving software they won't need mobileye.\n\nThis is one possible reason Intel already realized that Mobileye is NOT the future. \\*(I don't know for certain.) I am throwing out what i believe to be a very possible scenario and there are a few holes in my theory - but it makes alot of sense and this model will exist in 10-15 yrs or sooner - can it co-exist with Mobileye and apples I-car ideas and Tesla self-driving subscriptions and others?
