See if you can stomach the ups and downs. I would suggest not going all out, keep positions sizes small (and avoid using leverage). \n\n2. If you want to be more aggressive, there is nothing wrong with waiting until the market starts going in the direction you think it will go in, and THEN entering your trade. Being right and catching a smaller move is better than being early and getting burned. \n\n3. If you must use options, buying some long dated VIX options might be a decent way to get it out of your system.

In the mean time, they have missed out on the market tripling in value.\n\nThe problem with going all in on a crash at this point is that the market has already crashed.  Not every recession has a big shock like Black Monday in 1987, Black Tuesday in 1929, or the September 2008 collapse when the Lehman Brothers and others declared bankruptcy.\n\nSometimes it's just a slow burn.  The dot com bust, followed by the 9/11 recession is more analogous to what we're seeing now.  \n\nAnd when you talk about \"certainty\" ... the biggest drivers of economic concerns right now are basically the global supply chain crisis (largely Covid-related) and Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  Both of these things are contributing to higher prices, inflation, etc.  If China were to end their \"zero COVID\" policy tomorrow, or Russia were to withdraw from Ukraine, then the current bear market ends.  There is no crash.  There is no recession.  The stock market reaches new highs.\n\nYou just can't be \"certain\" of anything.\n\nThis isn't 2008.  In 2008, everything was a house of cards.  You said in another post you are fresh out of high school, so let me give you a history lesson.\n\nIn the 2000s, banks (egged on by the government) were encouraging EVERYONE to buy houses - regardless of whether or not they could afford them.  This created a feeding frenzy that drove the price of houses through the roof.  This led to people getting incredibly risky loans because it was free money - get an interest-only loan, refinance in a couple of years after your house has doubled in value, and you've got free money.\n\nThen gas prices shot up through the roof and all of a sudden, people were faced with either paying their mortgage or driving to work.  The whole house of cards came crashing down.  All of these people with adjustable rate mortgages and/or interest-only mortgages lost their houses.  Portfolios that had real estate holdings crashed.  Then everything crashed.\n\nThe warning signs had been there for years.  A lot of people knew it was a house of cards.  But you had corrupt politicians pushing it, saying that there could never be a housing crash, that mortgage-backed securities were 100% guaranteed, etc.  (I remember back in 2005 or 2006 or so watching a 60 minutes special on the coming mortgage crisis.)\n\nContrast that with today.  Today, the fundamentals are good.  You don't have people buying houses they can't afford.  The only real economic problem is inflation.
