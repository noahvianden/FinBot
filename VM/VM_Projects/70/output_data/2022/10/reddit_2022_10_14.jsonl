It has launched antitrust probes into technology companies, examined credit card firms and moved to restrict drug, energy and defense-company mergers.\n\nAt the same time, senior officials at the FTC disclosed more trades of stocks, bonds and funds, on average, than officials at any other major agency in\u00a0a Wall Street Journal review of financial disclosures at 50 federal agencies\u00a0from 2016 to 2021.\n\nMany of the investments overlapped with the FTC\u2019s work.\n\nA third of its 90 senior officials owned or traded stock in companies that were undergoing an FTC merger review or investigation, based on actions the agency has made public.\n\nFTC officials owned stock in 22 of the roughly 60 large companies the FTC brought cases against in the period reviewed.\n\nThe officials were most heavily invested in technology, an industry that has come under increasing scrutiny by the agency. Nearly one in four top FTC officials owned or traded individual stocks of tech companies such as\u00a0Amazon.\u00a0com Inc.,\u00a0MetaPlatforms\u00a0Inc.\u2019s\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0Alphabet\u00a0Inc.\u2019s\u00a0Google,\u00a0Microsoft\u00a0Corp.\u00a0and\u00a0Oracle\u00a0Corp.\n\nAn FTC chairman owned Microsoft, Oracle and\u00a0AT&T\u00a0Inc.\u00a0while the agency was conducting sensitive reviews affecting the tech and telecom sectors.\n\nThe head of the FTC\u2019s international division bought and sold Facebook stock through a financial adviser as his office coordinated with overseas enforcement officials on an investigation involving Facebook.\n\nAnd an FTC consumer-protection official owned stock in more than 10 companies as the agency scrutinized mergers or acquisitions involving the firms.\n\n\nFull article through archive:https://archive.ph/tv7Xm.\n\nTLDR: FTC trades companies they investigate.

{"title": "TSLA is a ponzi scheme?", "selftext": "According to \"The Ponzi Factor,\" [https://theponzifactor.com/the-ponzi-factor-proof-by-definition/](https://theponzifactor.com/the-ponzi-factor-proof-by-definition/), companies like Google, Tesla and Berkshire-Hathaway are ponzi schemes. Why? Because none of them  provide dividends to their shareholders and \"therefore,\" can only supply value to their investors by receiving an influx of investments from new investors, which is the definition of a ponzi scheme (see [https://www.sec.gov/files/ia\\_virtualcurrencies.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/files/ia_virtualcurrencies.pdf) and [https://www.sec.gov/spotlight/enf-actions-ponzi.shtml](https://www.sec.gov/spotlight/enf-actions-ponzi.shtml)).\n\nThis (if the reasoning is to be believed) means that Berkshire-Hathaway has been running a ponzi scheme for the past 183 years. But companies like Google and Tesla do provide value to their investors because they provide value to their customers: they actually do something useful, unlike, say, Bernie Madoff. Likewise, Berkshire-Hathaway provides value to its investors by investing in companies which provide great value to their customers. So The Ponzi Factor's claim doesn't make sense since they (TSLA, et al) don't need new investments to provide value to their customers; they provide value inherently. In fact that's precisely why they attract new investors: they provide great value in the future to those investors who were willing to invest in them in the past. Otherwise BRK wouldn't still be attracting new investors 183 years after its inception.\n\nDoes anyone think that The Ponzi Factor's claims make any sense?
