{"title": "BlackRock Profit Falls 16%", "selftext": "Firm\u2019s assets under management decreased to $8 trillion, from $8.5 trillion in the second quarter \n\nA souring market weighed on investing giant [BlackRock](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/BLK) Inc. [BLK -0.01%\u25bc](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/BLK?mod=chiclets) in the third quarter, pushing profit down 16%.\u00a0\n\nThe world\u2019s largest asset manager reported net income of $1.41 billion, down from $1.68 billion in the same period a year earlier.\n\nEarnings amounted to $9.25 a share. That exceeded the $7.06 expected by analysts polled by FactSet.\u00a0\n\nRevenue dipped 15% to $4.31 billion, above analysts\u2019 estimates of $4.2 billion.\u00a0\n\nCentral banks including the Federal Reserve are raising interest rates to try to cool red-hot inflation, adding stress to a market that is increasingly jittery over a possible recession. Stocks started the third quarter relatively strong, but soon headed lower as the Fed made increasingly clear that its rate increases are here to stay.\u00a0\n\nBlackRock is a top provider of exchange-traded funds and other low-cost alternatives that track market indexes, and demand for passive investing has helped fuel the firm\u2019s growth.\u00a0\n\nBlackRock is also a large provider of actively managed investments, which include businesses like stock-and bond-picking funds.\n\nInvestors\u2019 faith in the market declined, evidenced by slowing inflows of $17 billion, down from $75 billion a year ago.\n\nThe firm\u2019s assets under management were about $8 trillion, down from $8.5 trillion in the second quarter. That marks the third quarter-over-quarter decline in a row. BlackRock ended last year with $10.01 trillion in assets, the first time any money manager surpassed that milestone.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s base management fees\u2014fees not tied to performance that the firm receives for administering fund holdings\u2014dipped 10% from a year ago to $3.53 billion.\n\nPerformance fees from the firm\u2019s actively managed funds fell 76% to $82 million. BlackRock said that partly reflected lower fees from a single hedge fund.\u00a0\n\nIts technology remains the asset manager\u2019s bright spot. Revenue from Aladdin, its proprietary software that helps investors manage their portfolios and assess risk, rose 6% to $338 million.\n\n[https://www.wsj.com/articles/blackrock-profit-falls-16-11665658006?st=hhy94ybpg18aped&reflink=desktopwebshare\\_permalink](https://www.wsj.com/articles/blackrock-profit-falls-16-11665658006?st=hhy94ybpg18aped&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink)", "id": "y2x84v", "created_utc": 1665663445.0, "score": 269, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 74, "comments": [{"body": "Blackrock went so heavy into China during the pandemic.
