Companies are actually still growing nominal earnings because of inflation. The problem is that valuation compression from a rise in interest rates is much higher than companies' ability to grow and raise prices, so all of the downside and more are solely due to valuations going down. So, this can't really be compared to 2008 and is more like the dot com bubble. However, even in the dot com bubble, financial companies actually did quite well, but not this time because the Fed is increasing rates at an extremely fast pace to fight inflation. So, this is more like a 1970s scenario, but even then, the inflation problem was even worse because inflation spiraled out of control and valuations had to compress to less than 10 P/E.\n\nIn my opinion, what we are currently going through is most similar to the bear market in 1969, where government deficit spending stimulated the economy to the point where both inflation increased and unemployment decreased to about the same as it is now, and the boom increased stock valuations similar to the peak this time. Combined with Fed monetary tightening, the result was a mild recession in 1969-1970 where SPX went down about -36% before recovering completely. It's possible this time could be better than 1969-1970 because terminal interest rates end up lower, employment is very sticky, commodity shocks in terms of oil is less of a problem because the US is producing more of it and it is less a factor in the economy. In terms of natural gas, we are actually overproducing right now and LNG exports are capped, so there isn't really an energy crisis here, higher prices sure but not a potential supply crisis like what Europe is facing. And in almost everything except rent prices that lag, inflation seems to have peaked. Even rents are starting to roll over but you won't see this in the data until a year later. It's also possible this time could be worse because of the increased risks of a global slowdown with China staying with Covid zero for longer and Europe basically guaranteed to go into recession.\n\nWe won't be in a Japan style lost decade because peak valuations are not that high, the vast majority of stock valuations actually are lower than average, the US is basically in the best shape among all other countries right now, and inflation seems to be peaking. However that won't mean it won't take that long or longer for some stocks to recover, especially those with negative earnings and way too optimistic growth rates.
