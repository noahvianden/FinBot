{"title": "Tesla Earnings", "selftext": "Need to see what the non-adjusted eps was, but based on what I can read so far, the following is true:\n\nTesla Q3 '22 EPS - $1.05\n\nTesla Q3 '21 EPS - $.48\n\nTesla TTM eps $3.33. At the current SP of $208 (after hours), that puts PE ratio at 62. Down almost 20 points from it's current PE due to earnings growth. \n\nMeta - Between Q3 '21 and Q2 '22, EPS have declined by 23%, with an even bigger decline YOY once their Q3 earnings come out.\n\nAmazon - Q3 '21 eps were $0.31 and Q2 '22 eps were negative (-0.20). Maybe they'll get some support from Rivian SP going up around 30% between beginning Q3 and end of Q3, but their operating margins are still lousy in this inflationary environment. They're up against a tough comparison for Q3 '21 so their TTM EPS will likely further decrease, pushing up their PE ratio and putting pressure on share price.\n\nGoogle - EPS have decreased from $1.40 in Q3 '21 to $1.20 for Q2 '22. We'll have to see what Q3 brings, but likely it'll be less than the $1.4 eps they made in Q3 '21.\n\nEven apple is seeing eps decline. \n\nMy only point is that we've been in an earnings recession within big tech (and tech in general) for the past several quarters. Tesla has been one of the few outliers. Their eps growth has been explosive, where everyone else has been declining. Living in the Bay Area it's pretty impressive seeing how many teslas are now on the road..and the rest of the country is seeming to follow suit.
