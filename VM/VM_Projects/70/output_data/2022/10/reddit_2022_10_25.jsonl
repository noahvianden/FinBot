So what happens when Elon tweets this evening that he's not selling any more (plsss do it tonight elon)? institutions already collected on all your sales at the bottom as well as Elon's liquidity yesterday at rock bottom prices, leaving on the sidelines this huge *emotional-retail buying vaccum of sheer unadulterated FOMO-ready* for their beloved TSLA stock. I reckon you guys might actually blow this thing sky high this week. Thats why I just added to my existing 3x leveraged position with some extra OTM calls expiring this friday. Fuck it. I'm literally all in on everything except my house, and my Model Y, and my wife.\n\npositions: \n\n* 930x $TSLA\n* 25,000x $3LTP, 580p\n* 20x 11/11, $250 calls\n* 200x 28/10, $250 calls\n* (Some random $GME positions as a hedge in case you guys dont buy because your stubborn or something)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t2pxn1m49zv91.png?width=681&format=png&auto=webp&s=162399cb4c57cb89bb0388c04bed7964bd748717\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jysfkykc9zv91.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=71ba8fba7e26cefe72236dd9a74dc2fe7bb623cf\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5o6sygd29zv91.png?width=461&format=png&auto=webp&s=a996695f6b9d16286095e74ef2adbd7c6ea185f4", "id": "yd8xdl", "created_utc": 1666715012.0, "score": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.52, "num_comments": 71, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|14|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|28|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yd8xdl/tsla_is_literally_about_to_go_to_the_moon/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nmi5fn/amc_is_the_result_of_the_convergence_of_youtube/) \n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=yd8xdl)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=yd8xdl)\n    \n>TL;DR: Tesla is the first Skynet, Institutions know its value now, Elon tweets tonight to say he's not selling any more and doesn't want to be bought out.
