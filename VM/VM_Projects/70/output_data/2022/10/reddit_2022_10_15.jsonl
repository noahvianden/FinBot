Federal Reserve notes would become fully redeemable for and exchangeable with gold at the new fixed price, with the U.S. Treasury and its gold reserves backstopping Federal Reserve Banks as guarantor.\n\n\u201cThe gold standard would protect against Washington\u2019s irresponsible spending habits and the creation of money out of thin air,\u201d said Congressman Alex X.
