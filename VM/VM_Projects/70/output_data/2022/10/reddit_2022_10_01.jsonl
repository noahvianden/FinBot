The issue is that while the economy inflated with loose monetary policy, proper regulation wasn't set up to ensure that normal person wages kept up proportionally. The issue with this country is that people keep trying to paint this stuff as a social political issue (a short-term stance), when in reality this sort of thing absolutely has to do with long-term economic sustainability as well.\n\nI know that people like to talk about living wage as some sort of \"human decency\" thing but you can see it from an investment perspective as well. If you decrease wages through whatever methods, this means (for a public company) more profit for shareholders. However, decreases in wages also means that the workforce in aggregate at the present time as well as the future decreases in quality due to less resources to invest in education. It also depresses consumer activity in the short-term; money is not spent the same way across different distributions - one person with a huge amount of money will spend less than ten people with the same amount money (diminishing marginal utility).\n\nAnd so when you see it this way, the whole living wage stuff is more like should regulation favor short-term growth for shareholders or long-term sustainability of the economy. Due to the way election cycles work in the US with relatively fast turnover (compare a 4 year election term to a 30 year bond duration), it's really no surprise that favoring short-term growth has dominated in the past decades.\n\nUnfortunately, these decisions carry consequences and there is a reason long-term decision making is associated with wisdom while consistent short-term decision making is associated with poor outcomes.
