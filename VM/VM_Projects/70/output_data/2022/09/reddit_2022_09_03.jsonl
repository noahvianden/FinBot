Then she has media write articles saying \"CATHIE WOOD SAYS BTC WILL BE 1 MILLION DOLLARS BY 2030\" because the elite know BTC is going to fail to zero or at least like, a dollar (or they're delusional). Tricking retail into holding the bag while behind the scenes they're making bearish bets (tbh idk if cathie is doing that or not but she clearly has proven meritocracy is a myth just like elon).  \nBefore Elon changed Twitter's verification from the original system to 8 dollars for verification with absolutely no other identity verification involved Cathie was all over media talking about how she was buying MORE Twitter because of how genius of a move it was (and anybody with half a brain could see what was coming including people from twitter who put together a presentation listing all the reasons why it's a bad idea and basically all of them came true. I bet Elon fired them and did what he wanted to do anyway.) Elon could only \"run\" spacex and tesla as a mascot. Otherwise he had a very dedicated trumpian staff around him doing their best to manipulate him into believing he was coming up with the good managerial decisions to make. At twitter he doesn't have this. Ya know, I had read statisticians using math to prove changing CEOs has no impact that's measurable on company performance. You could've hired a cat as CEO and things would have kept moving along just fine. That just shows how bad Elon is. This whole in-group of elites need to go, and they especially need to stop pretending they're somehow on the side of the people trying to stick it to elites (somehow by choosing political allegiance based on literally nothing else than having a company facing a class-action lawsuit \\[a thing that's good for consumers or workers but not the elite\\] and not liking unions and deciding that somehow that both of those are Democrat things \\[republicans have suddenly decided they like unions though re: amazon lol\\]. Like there's nothing else going on in the world but Elon Musk and a couple niche issues. And he goes around siphoning public money and convincing the cancellation of public transport projects that ACTUALLY work by swooping in before they start and talking about hyperloops or the new hilariously bad invention of cars driving in tunnels without fire escapes that get traffic jams and require a human driver for every couple passengers and the cars are known to start on fire... ugh ok this turned into a rant about Elon Musk lmfao but I see both as one and the same.

Immutability is usually a bad thing for most applications. Imagine a security flaw, you can't update it when it's immutable unless you fork. Then you have disagreements about the fork if truly decentralized (but usually decentralization is a myth, see ethereum/ethereum classic and how that happened... plus POW uses way too much electricity. POS is whoever has the most pretend-money writes all the rules... which sounds like the exact same plutocracy as we already have but worse as crypto is generally only used to get around regulations that exist for very good reasons we have learned as a society over thousands of years.)  \n\n\nShe keeps talking about being so bullish on BTC and somehow grayscale which looks to be about to fail (but \"discount\"! ...) but for a recovery from this \"crypto winter\" there has to be an actual reason to go up. Masses of new people entering the space during the extremely unique circumstances of 2020-2021 will never happen again. Most got scammed, bc the main purpose of crypto now is to try and evade laws that exist to protect consumers (or for ransomware, very popular use... esp. by North Korea and Russia... otherwise it's all rugs, ponzi schemes, etc.) I don't think they're coming back. The technology is pretty terrible anyway. You could make a systems equivalent of BTC that processes incomparably more transactions per second - orders of magnitude - and  use the energy of a couple lightbulbs and just 10 central trustworthy-enough actors where 6 have to agree with each other each time. Vs crypto now where there are actually fewer actors controlling the networks and using the energy of entire 1st world nations during a time where we need to save the climate. Tesla is literally selling all their carbon credits to make their balance sheets better so environmentally they are worse than a lot of oil companies. Elon just pays money to be credited with things other people did, and when he DOES have an idea (which is still never actually original-usually ones where we don't do it because we already thought about it and realized it was dumb) ... <-that basically.
