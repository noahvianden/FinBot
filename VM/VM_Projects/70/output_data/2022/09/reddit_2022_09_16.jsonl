Take investment grade ratings, for instance.  I think Moody\u2019s is just following their formula for auto-companies and they will give investment grade eventually as Tesla gets enough product categories ticked off the list, which may take longer than 2023.  Seems Tesla is always doubted by Wall St, perhaps because of Musk\u2019s perceived impulsivity. IMO 2023 is the year big inst investors finally accept the fact that Tesla has really done it, they\u2019ve become the Apple of the car world.  This comes with a side of energy/storage products, high margin software (FSD), and energy services such as VPP with the good potential for these things to one day grow as large as the car business.  Add in TeslaBot and it\u2019s a brand that will become synonymous with high tech and manufacturing for decades to come.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["aapl", "tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["tsla", "tsla"]}
