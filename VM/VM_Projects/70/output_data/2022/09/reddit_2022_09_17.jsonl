{"title": "Elon Musk and Cathie Wood are right about the risk of deflation.", "selftext": "Elon Musk and Cathie Wood have expressed fear of us entering a deflationary environment.\n\nI agree with them, and I am going to break down my theory here.\n\n(1) You have to understand what rates hikes do. They make money more expensive\u2014that is, borrowing it is more expensive. This impacts inflation because it discourages spending.\n\n(2) HOWEVER, there are two sides to inflation, which is essentially the result of high demand.\n\n(3) High demand is caused by people having: \n\n(a) lots of (cheap) money, OR\n\n(b) not enough supply to go around, e.g., because of supply chain disruptions.\n\n(4) I am of the opinion that our current inflation problem is the result of the latter more than the former. Concededly, this can be a hard thing to determine.\n\n(5) If I am correct, then rate hikes do not fix the main cause of the problem. That is, it results in less spending but not correction of supply chain disruptions.\n\n(6) The Fed cannot do anything to fix supply chain disruptions. They do not have that power.\n\n(7) This means that the rate hikes are taking money out of the economy, but not fixing the main cause of our inflation\u2014but it is still slowing the spending of money.\n\n(8) This slowing, once supply chains normalize, will result in a deflationary environment\u2014because there will be a normal supply environment again, BUT not enough money to buy anything or invest in anything. \n\nTHIS is when we will find ourselves in a deflationary environment.\n\n(9) You do not want deflation. The economy will sputter. Nobody will make money because nobody will be spending.\n\n(Holding money means making money in such an environment. That is, why buy now if tomorrow my dollar will go further?)\n\nIn turn, the economy will tank because no one is spending or investing, and we will all eventually be poor.\n\n(10) You want low, predictable inflation for a strong economy.\n\n(It encourages reasonable spending and investment over hoarding what you have\u2014because holding money means losing money.)\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nElon Musk and Cathie Wood are right, if our premise is right that current inflation is more of supply chain issue than a cheap money issue.\n\n(I am of the opinion that the latest CPI print evidences our premise. Despite the rate hikes, inflation remains high. This suggests that the problem is not too much cheap money, but rather something else, i.e., supply chain disruptions. Hopefully, the Fed notices this as well.)", "id": "xgq7h2", "created_utc": 1663430360.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.45, "num_comments": 72, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|2|**First Seen In WSB**|1 week ago\n**Total Comments**|1151|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 week|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=xgq7h2)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=xgq7h2)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.10418399423360825}, {"body": "Both fucks have deep reasoning to shill that fake narrative.

The minimum wage cannot decrease,  therefore it would increase the purchasing power of anyone working for minimum wage.  It also increases the costs for government borrowing.  This is a good thing as hopefully it will force congress to actually balance the budget.  Also, people that save money will be rewarded more.  Since we have supply chain issues, it will reduce the strain on supply as people consume less and save more.  Housing market values will drop and rents should decrease as money becomes more valuable and less people are willing to buy/invest in houses to rent as it makes sense to only use real estate for living purposes instead of as a landlord because holding cash has a greater return on investment.
