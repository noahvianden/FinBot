Let me try to illustrate how I think he gets there. The only way a consumer would pay 100k for fsd is if they were certain they would be able to earn that amount back by using their car with fsd as a robo taxi. Let\u2019s say a robo taxi is able to drive for abt 16hrs a day, and spends the rest of its time charging/not doing anything. If it averages 25mph then your robotaxi would clock in abt 146k miles a year(25x16x365). I think Tesla has said before they could realistically drop the cost per mile for a robotaxi to abt $.2 while still being profitable. Keep in mind people pay something between $2-4 per mile when they use Uber so they def have room to raise the cost per mile. Let\u2019s say you as the owner get a $.1 cut per mile. You\u2019d make 14.6k a year and it would take you almost 7yrs to pay off the fsd. Now granted you can tweak the numbers and pay it off in 3.5yrs which sounds more reasonable if you got a $.2 cut per mile. Your car would also rack up over a million miles if it for 7yrs like that, but also isn\u2019t that why Tesla discussed their long cycle life \u201cmillion mile battery\u201d at battery day?
