She doubled down on that view at a press conference after the data release, noting that the substantial job losses, business shutdowns and strained budgets that typically accompany a recession are \u201cnot what we\u2019re seeing right now\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never had a recession without lay-offs, [and] I don\u2019t think we are close to a full-blown cycle of lay-offs. There\u2019s just no evidence of that,\u201d said Aneta Markowska, chief financial economist at Jefferies.\n\nEconomists point to the Sahm Rule. Developed by former Fed staffer Claudia Sahm, the rule stipulates that a recession takes root when the three-month moving average of the unemployment rate rises at least half a percentage point above its low over the past 12 months. By this metric, the unemployment rate would need to have surpassed 4 per cent to say the US is in recession.\n\nThe GDP data did, however, include signs of weakness beyond the headline figure that suggest a far less buoyant consumer and flagging investments. Economists at Citigroup went so far as to say that mid-2022 may mark a peak in activity.\n\nhttps://www.ft.com/content/50aac432-9dbe-4d82-a2c0-9e8823823ac9", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "The literal definition of recession is two consecutive quarters of negative gdp growth. \u2705\n\nLayoffs?

Amazon, Apple, and Google earnings were extremely strong which means the consumer is still going strong despite inflationary pressures. Oil has dropped BIGLY recently thanks to the administration doing everything they can to counteract a war in the East. \n\nFinally, no. There is not an official definition of a recession. The 2 quarters thing was always just something people went by. The way the market points to currently indicates that we may have been in a weak technical recession in the first half of the year but are quickly recovering from it. The later half of the year will just be another bull run. \n\nDon\u2019t forget though. All the money printing the Fed did during COVID is the main cause of all this inflation. And who was in office during COVID? Mr Trump. Who peaked at the largest unemployment since the Great Depression? Mr Trump. Who mishandled COVID and all the issues with the supply chain we see today? Mr Trump. Biden is literally the janitor mopping up the mess of the previous administration as Democrats do AS PER USUAL. Remember the recession in 08-09?
