High (unexpected) inflation leads to increasing interest rate in order to tame inflation. Increasing interest rates lead to better returns on risk free alternatives, thus less need to risk capital for returns on risky investment. Imagine risk free interest rates rising to 15%, you will likely prefer to invest your money into risk free investment instrument than the equity market in general. From a valuation perspective, rising interest rates affect the discount rates use to value the companies.\n2. Inflation eat into profit margin of most companies. More so for companies with less pricing power, increasing costs and industries that have ample capacity to produce supplies (supplies > demands) etc. Thus lower profit, lower returns on investment, lower stock prices.\n3. With lower profitability and less risk capital, there is a possibly for corporate spending reduction, employment reduction, personal spending reduction - which will lead to a recession. It is hard to determine whether a recession is a definite scenario, but the market is pricing in a less optimistic future by assuming a higher discount rate (higher risk free rate and risk premium) and/ or a less stellar profitability for the foreseeable future.\n4.

From Pages 23-33 of Deep Risk by William Bernstein\n\nSevere and persistent inflation reduced equity returns, but it did not savage them.  Even in the areas hit hardest by inflation.  Equity holders came out even (0% real return) or decently ahead over long periods (3% real return).\n\nEven German investors broke even if they were able to hold on to equities during the hyperinflation.  Bond holders of course, were wiped out.  \n\nIn the US, the sweet spot for united states equities was between 0-4%.  Average P/E was 17.5 during this time.  When inflation was over 6% though, P/E was 10.\n\nStock and Bonds are negatively correlated to inflation in the short term.  In the short term(about 1 year), stocks do bad during inflation(-12%), but bonds do even worse(-23%).  \n\nKey Point of above - Over the long term, stocks, although suffering from inflation in the short term, protect against it in the long term.   To put it another way, stocks exacerbate shallow risk, but protect against deep risk.  Another reason to hold a globally diversified portfolio is that it is unlikely all nations would have inflation and bad luck all at the same time.  \n\nInvesting in bonds when inflation is currently low is a bad strategy.  Inflation devastates bonds, but only when it is unexpected.  When it surprises to the upside, it drives down bond prices and yields up dramatically. \n\nBonds of nations with the highest 1 year TRAILING inflation had the highest returns going forward, and that the bonds of the nations with the lowest TRAILING inflation had the lowest returns going forward.  This makes sense; bonds respond to surprises and when it is either very high or very low, it tends to surprise to the downside or upside.  \n\nHigh inflation also introduces uncertainty, tends to drive bond yields higher than trailing inflation.   This usually sets the stage for high subsequent bond returns.  This is what happened during the Volker years in the United States\n\nThe strategy for above is to stay away from bonds for a few years after inflation has begun to rear its ugly head before jumping back in.  Also, a globally diversified stock portfolio, hedges deep risk very well.  A fixed rate mortgage is also a wonderful idea.\n\nHere is the Deep Risk Post\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/sdr4nw/young_investors_seriesthe_ages_of_the_investor/", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["inflation"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Long term you\u2019re right but higher rates means that companies/people got to pay more for debt.
