Earnings season starts and banks are coming out with bad performance, normally the reaction to this is hey banks aren't performing, market drops further, but something happened simultaneously, oil futures (everyone speculating on future oil production and proce) plummeted, they plummeted ironically because given high inflation and tightening money policy they think the US is headed into a recession. So while banks blessed us with their failings, the market blessed us with lower oil costs, but you see going back to 1. Oil prices being high were part of the reason the market was being pushed down. So when the banks said hey we are sucking, oil reacted and went even lower. When oil went lower, the market went \"wow, finally lower oil prices\" so the market suddenly regained momentum and went up.\n\nTLDR: Banks poor performance effect to drop the market was overcome by oil futures declining due to recession fears, the bigger effect was cheaper oil which made stocks rise.\n\nThe cycle doesn't end well though because eventually the recession does come, and low oil prices won't lift the market anymore and its just downhill for a while.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["recession", "inflation"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Does anyone read how to know?", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.22146408259868622}, {"body": "No i look at line go up and line go down.
