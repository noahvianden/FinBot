{"title": "The case for shorting Coca Cola $KO with puts", "selftext": "I bought 5 puts on KO @ 60 expiring Jan 20, 2024 for $500 per put.  \n\nEveryone and their mother has feared a recession and bought consumer staples, energy, or utility stocks.  Now some of those stocks are grossly overvalued.  Some of the tech bubble from 2021 rotated to consumer staples in 2022.\n\nKO is an awesome company with a crazy moat.  But its valuation is horrible.  Its forward PE is 25.7, forward P/FCF 23.3, and forward EV/EBIT is 26.  If Coke misses earnings then those multiples will be even higher.  Coke is supposedly a mature dividend stock, but it's trading like a growth stock.\n\nIn reality, Coke's revenue has deceased over the past 10 years.  Coke pays a dividend of 2.8%, compared to a ten year treasury yield of 2.9%.  Why these crazy high multiples?  Because recession fears have pushed equity holders into staples, energy, or utilities.  So there's a market inefficiency to exploit because too many people are crowded into too few areas.  And nobody is shorting staples stocks right now, so puts are very cheap.\n\nOptions are dangerous because you can lose your entire investment.  Nibble at first and don't overextend yourself relative to your portfolio.  But I think Coke will fall in half from these levels and long-dated puts here can be very profitable given their current cost.\n\nI might be early but I'm not wrong.  In 10 years Coke will not trade at today's multiples.", "id": "vtosdp", "created_utc": 1657216849.0, "score": 48, "upvote_ratio": 0.77, "num_comments": 77, "comments": [{"body": "Classic Coke is about as unavoidable as death and Taxes.\n\nI don't own any as I haven't found a good point of entry, but put's would not be my move.\n\nHope it works out for you - if it sinks I'll jump in.", "score": 31, "replies": [{"body": "Inherited it.

You can be given up to 15k by someone without paying taxes on the gift.  Then, you get dividends on whatever stocks they gave you, but you pay regular income taxes on those new dividends because you've owned the stock less than a year. Then the next year, you get more stock as a gift and pay regular income tax on the dividends from the stock you just received, but, the stock from the year before had now been held for a year, so the dividends become qualify dividends and the money they generate is taxed at the capital gains rate.  I believe that the 15k a year is capped at a million or something over the lifetime and counts towards the estate total of the gifter's estate (no estate tree ax under 11 or so million) but, the giftee gets to reap all of the dividend benefits for all of the years as part of their pot of money.  The stepped up basis only kicks in when someone dies and the estate is fully counted to see if someone has to pay estate tax.  My uncle was a tax lawyer for very rich people and this is what he did. \n\nEdit: stepped up basis is complicated.
