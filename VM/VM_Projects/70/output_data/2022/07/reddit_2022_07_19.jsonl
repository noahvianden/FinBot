By constantly selling that premium you're basically saying you believe the premium you are receiving will be greater than the average move on the underlying so eventually it will pay off to do it. \n\nIn many cases the strategy would work much better by just holding the underlying and not selling options. Then sell part of the stock for \"income\" every month or when it goes high enough. \n\nAlso selling calls does reduce the risk on the position and reduced risk generally means less potential reward.
