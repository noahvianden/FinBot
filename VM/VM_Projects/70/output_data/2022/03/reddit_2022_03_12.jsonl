{"title": "Ford is Looking Cheap", "selftext": "Ford is, by my estimation, the legacy car maker in the best position to capture EV sales in the future.\n\nI have three basic premises:\n\n1. Ford is likely one of the top two companies in the US in terms of EV positioning, second only to Tesla.\n2. EV automotive manufacturing and marketing is still automotive manufacturing and marketing, and Ford is far more experienced and knowledgable on this front than any EV company, including Tesla.\n3. Ford is selling at a steep discount (by any metric) to EV startups.\n\nIf the above three are correct, I believe one or both of the next two points must be correct:\n\n* Ford is significantly undervalued.\n* EV startups and specialists like Tesla are significantly overvalued.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, the second point above must be ***grossly*** true in order for the first point to not be true. The market must have wildly inflated the values of other EV companies in order for Ford to not be undervalued.\n\nI'll avoid getting too far into the weeds on earnings and production numbers here, but I'll at least lay out the current market cap of some relevant players:\n\n* Tesla: $839B\n* Ford: $64B\n* Lucid: $40B\n* Rivian: $36B\n* GM: $60B\n\nThe points I'm making here likely apply just as well to GM, but I'm a bit more bullish on Ford's vision for their EV future. I'm also not trying to turn this into a generalized \"Is Tesla overvalued?\" thread.\n\nBut, if EV manufacturing is not so different from ICE manufacturing that companies with zero experience in the automotive world (like Rivian and Lucid) have an advantage over Ford, which has produced America's best selling vehicle for the last bazillion years, then Ford is coming into this new EV world with better experience and a plan that is, in my estimation, at least as good as Rivian's and Lucid's.\n\nIn order to believe Ford is not overvalued, you must believe at least one of the following:\n\n1. Ford sucks so badly at automotive manufacturing and marketing that its experience is a negative contributing factor.\n2. EVs are so vastly different from ICE and hybrid vehicles that Rivian's and Lucid's EV-specific natures give them an advantage over Ford.\n3. The automotive sector in general is such an unprofitable sector that all of these companies are overvalued, which implies that Tesla is selling for Benjamins on the dollar.\n\nThis isn't a true due dilligence report.

Most of that debt it tied to Ford Credit. That is debt that is making a crap ton of money for the motor company. \n\nThat's still not risk free debt for Ford. There's a reason a lot of banks don't  give auto loans. Automobiles tend to depreciate rapidly, meaning if someone defaults on their car loan it's possible that the lender will be forced to eat a loss.\n\nFor now car prices are obviously going insane, so that's not a problem if a bunch of people default on their loans. But what about in an environment where there's not an automobile shortage? Worse yet, the vast majority of those loans are on ICE vehicles, which may farther down the line start seeing more rapid depreciation when consumer demand shifts away from ICE and towards EVs.\n\nPoint being, yes technically the vast majority of debt is loans other people owe Ford, but it's not without it's risks for Ford.\n\n> 2) they basically just separated off the EV business, moving that to more of a Tesla model.

Ford is **not** spinning off their EV branch into a separate business that doesn't have to bother with the dealerships. What Ford did was essentially move the EV segment into it's own department that reports to a separate management team then the ICE division. The dealerships don't care about that, because it changes nothing for them. Ford still has to sell EV's through their dealerships.\n\nThe reason Dealerships hate EVs is because they usually require a lot less maintenance, and maintenance/repairs is where dealerships make the majority of their profits, not selling vehicles. This is why most dealerships from all the automakers hate EVs. The car salesmen are often disincentivized to sell EVs because of this (because they often get less commissions, and an EV sale takes more time due to the necessary steps of educating the consumer on it).", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "1) That debt might not be \u201crisk free\u201d but it really is about as close as you can get.  99% of that debt is secured by collateral, and with much of that being at the dealer level with wholesale and mortgages.

Because autos are a persons lifeline to their job.  There are very few \u201cbanks\u201d that don\u2019t make auto loans.  Auto loan origination is one of the most competitive lines of the finance business.  Also, loans being on ICE vehicles is definitely not a problem.  We are still decades away from full EV.
