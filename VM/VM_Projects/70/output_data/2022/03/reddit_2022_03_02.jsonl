Smartphones, computers, and watches should trend towards increased gaps in replacement in that environment. \n\nSecond Point: Apple has been building an amazing foundation for their ecosystem with top quality \u201cadd-ons\u201d, such as fitness, video and gaming content, integration across all apps at operating system level, etc., however; it has not found any new market to take that foundation. The rumors regarding car, glasses, AR device have lingered for what, 10 years? It is ... challenging to see a business with so much cash unable to use it besides buying stock and giving it to investors. In addition the globe is experiencing substantial supply issues. Due to Apple\u2019s customer base size, it becomes less likely a new product is released until supply is normalized.\n\nFinal point: Right now Apple\u2019s security, to some degree, is acting as a store of value facing supply, inflationary, economic, and geopolitical challenges.
