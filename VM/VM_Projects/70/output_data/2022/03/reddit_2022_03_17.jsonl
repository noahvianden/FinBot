The greater effect is that the drawdown in bank reserves goes into bank risk calculations which influence \\*HOW MUCH CREDIT BANKS ARE WILLING TO ISSUE.\\*\n\nWhen banks expect a drawdown, they tighten the credit and lending market.\n\nLiquidity in the reserve system also serves to offset toxic assets, which was the entire idea of QE during the pandemic since there was an expected (and would have been realized if not for state intervention) significant and immediate rise in foreclosures, and mortgage backed securities if not purchased by the Fed or offset by excess liquidity, would have inflated the toxic asset ratio.\n\nBasically, let's say your bank has a toxic asset ratio of 3% and then the pandemic comes along and changes the buying patterns (or the state shuts you down, we're not having the debate here about which was the greater effect... what matters is that incomes were halted and defaults became a real threat to the banking system) and now the drop in income increases your toxic asset ratio by 7% over 3 months... so now you have a 10% toxic and the market's freaking the hell out and people are pulling money out of the banking system and banking stocks crash and then \\*boom\\* recession and possible depression...\n\n...but if you flood the bank with money, that toxic asset ratio goes down.\n\nThis is the equivalent of a bank margin call. The Fed just deposited money to make sure the accounts stayed solvent and payrolls could continue to roll and new debt could be generated.\n\nSo what this did was go into bank risk department calculations about how much debt they could generate. Banks may seem stupid, and having worked in my fair share in my career I can attest that there are plenty of stupid people who work at banks, bank risk departments after 2008 generally aren't.\n\nBanks are aware that the Fed was going to come calling for that money back, which is why consumer debt only gapped up at the standard trendline during the pandemic.\n\nBullard actually made this argument arguing for aggressive drawdown the other day. The simple fact of the matter is that the money the Fed put into the system simply has not entered the economy, and is not inflationary, but the perception is that by promoting bank lending it may have helped drive inflation...\n\n...except they expanded the capital in that system by > 40%... a 0.25% rate may bring in a lot of capital through expanded interest, but the balance sheet drawdown is minimal against the total reserve, which is why JPOW signaled today that the Fed is talking about further measures to draw down the balance sheet. \n\nThis is important because the actual risk of inflation related to money in the bank reserve system in the future is to banks loosening the credit belt. The perception that loose money created our inflation is driven by simplistic, primarily right-wing, monetary policy hawkish belief systems rather than consistent understanding of macroeconomic processes. Whenever I bring up that, some dildo-brained, leather-huffing cretin will always come out of the woodwork and say \"if yer sayin increasin money suppliez don't increese inflayshun yer wong!\"\n\nFirst of all, I'm not even Chinese... second, what I'm saying is that the data doesn't show that money left the reserve system at a high enough rate to influence price pressures, and that most of the inflation right now is due to supply chain issues combined with an oddity in the Year over Year inflation calculations that creates an illusion of higher than normal inflation because of 0% effective inflation in 2020 and due to the heavy gap up in fuel prices... all of which was brought up by JPOW today in his statements. (I've been saying this for months and JPOW FINALLY said it.) \n\nMoney supply influences inflation, absolutely, but only if that money supply is in circulation, not sitting in a bank reserve fund where it can't compete for goods.\n\nMonetary policy hawks use false binary dichotomies like this because they have a belief that drives them ideologically. If you question it, their worldview falls apart. What they really need is a high school econ 101 class. \n\nAnyway... OK, so inflation so far is primarily supply chain, and so anyone thinking it's the cash reserve right now is out on a sinking boat of their own making, which is why this move won't do very much to change inflation in the short term. \n\nThe real danger is due to the fact that high capital reserve ratios at banks look bad to investors, because undeployed capital is dead weight in the banking system. By increasing the funds rate, banks will increase finance rates, and that will marginally reduce new debt requests, but in reality what happens is that this now factors into bank risk department calcs that reduce new debt offerings, and that, combined with JPOW's speech which was a signal to bankers not to let the spigots open, will keep that money more likely in the bank system.\n\nBank investors want capital deployed, but they don't want banks with high toxic asset ratios. Knowing the new Funds rate gives the bank a new known, which reduces risk, but by keeping other hikes and other drawdowns on the table, he's signaling to banks that they may call that money back faster than expected, which could put the bank at risk. \n\nThat's what will actually blunt the future inflationary curve because debt won't be as much on offer because investors won't be demanding that it be deployed at as high a rate. it won't do very much for demand on its own... rising prices are starting to do that, but a marginal interest rate hike isn't going to matter much to human consumption psychology.", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "Great read, thanks for breaking this down.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks. I appreciate that you enjoyed it!\n\nA couple of things I forgot to cover:\n\nWhile consumer debt was restrained according to the data I've seen, relative to what could have been released, what I can pull together indicates that part of the expansion of institutional margin had to do with expanded credit to these accounts, which makes sense because by definition they're collateralized leverage... which helps explain how the market expanded without expanded capital reserve entering the economy proper. Most people cite people sitting at home getting free stimulus from the government, but the data actually indicates that while may have been a factor to some extent, people also saved money and paid down debt, which is part of where the gap up in economic activity in 2020/2021 came from... but those savings are exhausted now and debt gapped up, so we can expect normalization there... but the bigger factor is that expanded margin debt allowance drove increasing leverage, which is how you get 30% YoY market growth. And most of that money replaced lost income, so by definition it's not excess capital.\n\nWhile I can't say for certain that the expansion in margin was due solely to the Fed's increase in money supply, what I can say is that institutional margin leverage expanded  heavily in part due to low rates, and while consumers may not care about a 0.25-1% hit in their credit rates, institutions using margin and weighing current gain potential against the traditional 10 year 2% growth stock average return assumption and a >2% 10 year T bill may have a disincentive to leverage back up again without greater confidence in expanded returns during the next quarter. The T bill purchases will generate a risk-on impulse because they reduce risk in the balance sheet, but that margin cost may, in some circumstances, convince managers not to leverage up in a weak market unless they're playing puts, and that could contribute to negative gamma.\n\nThere's an argument that expansion of the market generated inflation due to the wealth effect and ROI from the bull run, which is not crazy but probably like the stimulus argument wildly overstated. Most people don't even own stocks still, and of the rest the majority have capital locked up in stocks... the percentage of that in commodities and REITs may be promoting inflation, and low bank rates probably do have an impact on shelter prices that is not insignificant, but I don't know given where rates are if a small bump in the funds rates will change that demand curve.\n\nAdd in geopolitical uncertainty and you have an argument for multiple compression to continue, potentially, but a good bull run could be enough to light the fire again given that capital liquidity in the near term won't actually be a major problem. Returns elevating solves the margin leverage motivation problem... and with elevated capital velocity in the market even compressed multiples provide a bullish thesis once uncertainty abates further. As long as banks don't become hyper risk averse, the flow of fresh capital should continue even with a balance sheet drawdown. Without Ukraine, I'd be more confident in that... but with Ukraine I'm more confident in a bullish future deglobalized domestic economic activity outlook, so there's these weird conflicts we have to consider.", "score": 6, "replies": [], "tickers": ["inflation"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.22238020598888397}, {"body": "Wow.
