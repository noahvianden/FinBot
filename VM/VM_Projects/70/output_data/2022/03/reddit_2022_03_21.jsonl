{"title": "WSB AIR FORCE INTEL", "selftext": "Checking flight radars, I have noticed a highly suspicious movement of military/government planes between USA-Algeria-Spain-Russia-China. \n\nFirst it started on 15.07.21 when I saw a weird Royal Moroccan Air Force C130 RMAF209 tracking over Algeria.\n\nOn 12.09.2021 Algeria Air Force C130H 7T-WHO headed towards Florida. A couple of hours later it was accompanied by USAF Rogue 51. \nOn 15.11.2021, CIA linked Tepper L-100-30 (382G) N3755P was seen en route to Faro Portugal from Algeria. It is very rare you can see sth like this but I decided to put my conspiracies away and wait. \n\nI will continue in comments below. \n\nOn 11.12.2021 I noticed Russian Air Force AN-124 RFF9911 heading towards Algeria. It stayed there 9 days. It is a lot. But again it could be just some meetings between officials I thought. \n\nThe war has broken down in Ukraine and on 09.03.2022 I noticed a US Special Operation Command C146A 09-3106 Wolfhound departed Algiers Algeria. \n\nAt the same time, Deputy Secretary Wendy Sherman was noticed en route to Spain from Algeria (01-0076). Then shit got fanned and I digged into gas geopolitics. \n\n2 days ago, Spain made a strategic move and reversed a 46-year policy about Western Sahara, for 1st time supporting Morocco's view. Algeria, the main backer of Western Sahara, has recalled its ambassador in Madrid. Spain buys lots of Algerian gas. The crisis has not affected pipeline or LNG supply into Spain from Algeria (and most think it would not), but it comes at a time of extreme tension across gas markets. Last year, Spain bought ~42% of all its gas from Algeria. \n\n10 hours ago Algeria AF VIP GLF5 7T-VPG was en route from Huangshan China. \nA couple of hours after news broke out in Spain \u201cChina supports Algeria and accuses Spanish President S\u00e1nchez of playing \"strategic games\" in the Sahara.\n\nSo yes boys, oil is still important.", "id": "tjlu1r", "created_utc": 1647896224.0, "score": 146, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 79, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|2|**First Seen In WSB**|8 months ago\n**Total Comments**|1800|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|3 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=tjlu1r)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=tjlu1r)\n    \nHey /u/jasonredit, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Looks like I am getting banned boys.
