The bills\u2019 opponents also say it is fair for e-marketplaces, search engines and app stores to profit off their creations\u2019 popularity.\n\nThe department\u2019s letter throws its weight behind a different view: that the platforms\u2019 dominant position gives them unchecked power to influence the fate of other businesses, and that restricting the platforms\u2019 conduct would carry significant benefits. \n\n\u201cDiscriminatory conduct by dominant platforms can sap the rewards from other innovators and entrepreneurs, reducing the incentives for entrepreneurship and innovation,\u201d the letter says.\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/justice-department-backs-antitrust-bill-targeting-apple-amazon-google-11648522635?mod=home-page](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/justice-department-backs-antitrust-bill-targeting-apple-amazon-google-11648522635?mod=home-page)", "id": "tquduo", "created_utc": 1648539169.0, "score": 499, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 77, "comments": [{"body": "Great.

{"title": "I may be old school but...", "selftext": "When I go to invest in the shares of a company, I think of myself as buying a part of that company.  I ask myself \"would I want to own this company?\".  Often I say \"hell yeah!\" who wouldn't want to own a company that is printing money? (like oil companies and banks and steel companies) and who wouldn't want to own a company that has truly disruptive technology that is going to change the world? (like Tesla and Amazon and Microsoft and Apple did)  But then there are other times when I say \"not in a million years\"  Why would I want to own a company that is bleeding cash and really has no prospects of ever turning a profit?  One where the only way that I'm going to make money is to sell my shares to some sucker.  When I find companies in the first category I buy their stock.  When I find companies in the latter category I buy their puts.  I am long in 60 different companies.  Some of them are old school (value) some of them are new school (growth).  I want to talk about the ones that I have puts on.\n\nIf you had $21 Billion would you buy CHWY?  A company that sells pet food online?  Wasn't this tried in the late 1990's with very little success?  If this company was going to turn a profit, they would have done it in 2020 and 2021.  They may plod along for a while but this is not the next big growth success story even though it's priced that way.  Position 50 x 05/22p $35 strike.\n\nIf there was a company that was making $4.50 per share per year that suddenly experienced everything going in its favour for one year and made $16 per share, would you say to yourself \"I'm going to assume that they are going to make $16 per share every year from now on\" and buy that company based on its short term performance?  I wouldn't.  That's why I own AN puts.  Position 10 x 01/24p $95 strike\n\nWould you buy a company that has never turned a profit despite the fact that it is in an old world industry and has been around for 10 years?  One that suddenly found itself in a position where the perfect storm of tailwinds was propelling it forward.  One whose revenues suddenly increased by 50% but still resulted in a loss?  Would you value  that company based on a multiple of sales when increased sales doesn't result in profit? I own 10 x 01/23p $120 strike. UPDATE:  I MISSED THE COMPANY HERE.  IM NOT TALKING ABOUT GME. IT\u2019S CVNA\n\nThere's a theme here.  Companies that  have benefited massively from the pandemic who have either been unable to make a profit despite being provided with the best conditions possible or have been  given valuations that seem to assume that we are going to be in a pandemic forever.  It's too late to say that I don't want to bore you but I'll cut this short.", "id": "trr9ev", "created_utc": 1648592876.0, "score": 19, "upvote_ratio": 0.65, "num_comments": 74, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|18|**First Seen In WSB**|9 months ago\n**Total Comments**|310|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|9 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=trr9ev)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=trr9ev)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.25190967321395874}, {"body": "Time for bed grandpa", "score": 35, "replies": [{"body": "Lmao", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.07921092212200165}, {"body": "I\u2019m headed there but I\u2019m going to take a dip in my swimming pool full of money first.", "score": 6, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2193959504365921}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.17891541123390198}, {"body": "Too many words.
