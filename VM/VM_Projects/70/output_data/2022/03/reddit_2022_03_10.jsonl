{"title": "I've never used margin, so dumb question...can you pull it out of your account as a loan?", "selftext": "Interactive Brokers, portfolio margin.  I do safe Covered calls with protective puts, on leaps I don't want to sell yet, and my account is all equity at this point. If I wanted to borrow against that I could probably get 75% (?) of my account value as a cheap loan for other uses- home improvement etc. \n\n\n\nI would leave enough for maintenance margin- but the put/call spreads are so small that even 5-10% of the equity would be enough, even in a crash.\n\nSo would I just do a transfer to my linked checking account at Chase, and ignore that it's greater than my cash balance in IB? And the next month I would see interest, and buying power reduced? Simple as that?\n\nEDIT 2 Got my answer. One comment is from someone who does exactly this. You can use a debit card against margin, or call them and have money wired to your bank account against margin, and they advertise the rate on this card as under 1.5% so same as trading margin rate. If you have big account it's even lower- but variable.\n\n\nEDIT based on a few comments that Schwab allows this, I found this on IB site...a Debit card you can use against margin. Wonder if they'd approve a 1 million debit card transaction on a condo lol...but doesn't mention any limit. Just a calculator of how much you can borrow, and for laughs I put in \"10,000,000 long stock\" and it said 8.5 Million limit if portfolio margin.\n\nhttps://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=26451", "id": "taxbfe", "created_utc": 1646914230.0, "score": 38, "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "num_comments": 78, "comments": [{"body": "r/PowerDeleteSuite", "score": 25, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks.

{"title": "U.S. Inflation Hit Fresh 40-Year High of 7.9% Before Oil Spike", "selftext": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-10/u-s-inflation-hits-fresh-40-year-high-of-7-9-before-oil-spike\n\n(Bloomberg) -- U.S. consumer price gains accelerated in February to a fresh 40-year high on rising gasoline, food and housing costs, with inflation poised to rise even further following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. \n\nThe consumer price index jumped 7.9% from a year earlier following a 7.5% annual gain in January, Labor Department data showed Thursday. The widely followed inflation gauge rose 0.8% in February from a month earlier, reflecting higher gasoline, food and shelter costs. Both readings matched the median projections of economists in a Bloomberg survey.\n\nExcluding volatile food and energy components, so-called core prices increased 0.5% from a month earlier and 6.4% from a year ago.\n\nThe figures show an inflation cloud over the economy that\u2019s proved more persistent and expansive. The price spike has pushed the Federal Reserve to end two years of near-zero interest rates, likely starting with a quarter-point hike next week. It\u2019s also sunk President Joe Biden\u2019s approval ratings ahead of November\u2019s midterm elections that may cost Democrats their thin congressional majorities, especially as inflation outpaces wage gains.\n\nWhile February was once forecast as the peak for U.S. inflation, now readings are set to increase to above 8%, according to some economists. That\u2019s because the Ukraine war and Biden\u2019s ban on Russia energy imports tightened oil supplies and sent prices of U.S. retail gasoline and other commodities to some of the highest on record this month.\n\n\u201cInflation is not likely to roll over and begin to come down for several more months,\u201d Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Barclays Plc said on Bloomberg Television. \u201cThis sets the stage for where we are now. And we need to see how long this conflict plays out and how disruptive the sanctions regime actually is.\u201d\n\nThe geopolitical situation adds uncertainty to the central bank\u2019s rate hiking cycle over the coming year. Fed officials could take a more hawkish stance if energy shocks lead to higher and more persistent inflation, but they also may take a more cautious approach if sinking consumer sentiment and declining real wages begin to weigh on growth as the war drags on.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Economics Says...\n\n\u201cThere is a cost to the Fed being gradual: Future inflation is best predicted by lagged values of past inflation, and a more gradual Fed now likely mean a more aggressive Fed later.\u201d\n\n-- Anna Wong and Andrew Husby, economists\n\nThe S&P 500 opened lower and the yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose.\n\nThe February CPI data showed that gasoline prices climbed 6.6% from the prior month and accounted for almost a third of the monthly increase. Some of that may reflect energy price spikes resulting from the first days of Russia\u2019s invasion during the last week of the month. The impact will be more fully captured in the March CPI report. \n\nSo far this month, the retail price of a regular-grade gasoline has increased 19.3% to $4.32 a gallon, according to American Automobile Association data.\n\nFood prices climbed 1% from the prior month, the largest advance since April 2020, the CPI report showed. Compared with February last year, the 7.9% jump was the biggest since 1981.\n\nWhile the war\u2019s full impact on the U.S. economy remains unclear, soaring costs of oil, grains and metals are likely to feed through to other commodities and ultimately consumer prices. The Biden administration on Tuesday banned Russian oil imports into the U.S., a move that will add to energy price pressures.  \n\nReal Earnings\n\nWage increases as a result of a tight labor market haven\u2019t been keeping up with inflation. Inflation-adjusted average hourly earnings dropped 2.6% in February from a year earlier, the largest drop since May and the 11th straight decrease, separate data showed Thursday. \n\nThe report showed that prices for merchandise continued their climb in February, while annual growth in services costs accelerated. On a year-over-year basis, goods inflation rose by 13%, the most since 1980. That included the largest-ever annual increase in prices of new cars and trucks.\n\nServices costs increased 4.8% from a year ago, the biggest advance since 1991.\n\nShelter costs -- which are considered to be a more structural component of the CPI and make up about a third of the overall index -- rose 0.5% from the prior month, the most since November. Rent of primary residence increased 0.6% on a monthly basis, the largest advance since 1987.\n\nMotor-vehicle repair costs shot up by a record 4.3% from January, and an index of personal care jumped an unprecedented 1.2%.\n\nThe prices of hotel stays and airfares rebounded in February following the omicron-related pullback in economic activity in December and January.\n\n\u00a92022 Bloomberg L.P.", "id": "tb12jm", "created_utc": 1646925855.0, "score": 386, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 75, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|10|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|3|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|8 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=tb12jm)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=tb12jm)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4117297828197479}, {"body": "8.5% or higher for March", "score": 91, "replies": [{"body": "Easily 9+.
