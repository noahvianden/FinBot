The most obvious is buying deep ITM calls in the first place act as a synthetic leverage. Let us say I have enough money to buy 500 PYPL shares now, but I want 1k shares and I like the current price. I know I have money coming in in the next 6 months, but I want to lock in a price now for those shares. I would buy 10 PYPL calls 6 months out that have a strike price that is  half the current market price(I.E buying deep ITM calls). This will roughly cost the same as 500 shares because of the intrinsic value+a little premium for the time value. I eventually have the money 6 months later. I go ahead and exercise all the calls and boom I have my 1k shares I wanted at a price I wanted 6 months ago. It is typically a smart move if you're bullish on a stock, but don't have all the funds available to buy as many shares as I want.

The trading restrictions I've had to deal with are ridiculous. My roles have had nothing to do with MNPI (material non-public information), and I have no way of accessing whatever MNPI the company holds onto. I'm not allowed to own any single stocks. I have to buy etfs and mutual funds. Which makes trading in a down market like this so difficult. It's hard enough to find the few stocks that will perform well, and basically impossible to find an ETF that will make money in a down market. \n\nAdd on top of that, I wasn't told of the trading restrictions when I started my new job (which is even more strict than my last job). I was holding a few stocks that were allowed in my old job but not my new one. When I disclosed them, I was informed I wasn't allowed to even sell them. So they are locked up in my brokerage account until I eventually quit my job I guess. It's about 6k, which doesn't sound like a lot of money, but for me it is. I'm still in my 20's and I'm trying to pay off my car early and save up to buy a house. Also, they were pandemic stock picks for the most part (WBA, PFE, BMY) so I wasn't intending on holding them longer than a year. They don't have nearly the outlook now as they did when I bought them. \n\nThe restrictions are mostly due to government regulations, although my company is even more strict than the regulations because the government doesn't fuck around when employees trade on inside information. It's a huge liability for the company so I get why they do it. \n\nBut we have politicians with more access to insider information than I will ever be privy too, making fucking millions off of it, while simultaneously passing regulations that prevent me from making trades in the \"free market\" as Nancy likes to say.

How does that actually improve the driving experience? It doesnt. Its fundamentally worse. Its only great if you have a handicap or something.
