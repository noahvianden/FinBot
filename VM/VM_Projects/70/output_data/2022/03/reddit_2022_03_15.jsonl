{"title": "Reddit is eyeing a $15 billion IPO. Here\u2019s how it became the giant cultural force it is today.", "selftext": "[https://www.businessofbusiness.com/articles/reddit-15-billion-ipo-cultural-force/](https://www.businessofbusiness.com/articles/reddit-15-billion-ipo-cultural-force/)\n\nReddit is many things: the people\u2019s forum, a repository of the dankest memes, the not-so-secret weapon against Wall Street, and \u201cthe front page of the internet\u201d. It might also soon be known as a publicly traded company valued at [$15 billion](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/reddit-files-us-ipo-2021-12-16/). The famed social media platform plans to take itself public sometime this year (possibly as soon as [this month](https://www.barrons.com/articles/reddit-initial-public-offering-ipo-news-51639645252)). Reddit has already filed preliminary IPO registration statements with the SEC and has [engaged Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-07/reddit-is-said-to-tap-morgan-stanley-goldman-sachs-for-ipo?sref=qMIA4tzu) to guide it.\u00a0\n\nThis potential IPO represents a big moment for a company that has undeniably earned itself a prominent place in the internet zeitgeist. Internet dwellers have long turned to Reddit\u2019s online communities for loosely moderated bonding over shared passions ranging from [tripping acid](https://www.reddit.com/r/LSD/) to [admiring the CCP](https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZedong/). Over years of playing host to strange worlds of bronies and NSFW video enthusiasts, the platform has contributed much slang to the [pop culture lexicon](https://www.businessofbusiness.com/articles/the-wallstreetbets-glossary-a-field-guide-to-apes-stonks-tendies-AMC-GME-reddit/)*.* But the platform really showed its reach in 2021, when posters on r/WallStreetBets [orchestrated a short squeeze](https://www.businessofbusiness.com/articles/reddit-vs-wall-street-by-the-numbers-one-year-later-wallstreetbets-gamestop-amc-cloverhealth-tesla-blackberry/) of multiple stocks including GameStop and AMC. Until Reddit goes public, the term \"Reddit stock\" refers to securities hyped by retail investors on the platform. The successful effort to stick it to institutional investors sent shockwaves through Wall Street and may have inspired a [DOJ inquiry](https://www.businessofbusiness.com/articles/the-big-short-seller-probe-who-are-the-investors-on-the-dojs-list/) into a number of prominent short sellers.\u00a0\n\nA company with a big role in internet history, Reddit has quite a history of its own. Its story embodies the spirit of Web2 entrepreneurship, with its college-nerd beginnings, minor trickery, and a corporate acquisition that left its founders feeling short-changed.\u00a0", "id": "texpbk", "created_utc": 1647372390.0, "score": 44, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "num_comments": 72, "comments": [{"body": "Missed their chance to go public last year and unload some of their bags on retail before the market took a dump.

Supply chain issues and the distraction in manufacturing during COVID peaks have thrown things off. Many popular model new cars are on back order as well. I have a friend who is still waiting for his 2022 Ford pickup that was supposed to be delivered last Sep/Oct. Worse is that this makes the price of used cars go way up. That being said, Tesla produces cars at a fraction of the pace as other manufacturers. And most people know this, which is why people are not flocking to grab a Tesla, there's a line, and an expensive one too. Also, realistically, a Tesla won't save someone money, and people with money know this. They just want the Iphone car. Haha.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I agree about people wanting the trendy car because the issue with EVs is that they take longer to charge than it takes to fill up a car with gas. Also they can't go as far on a charge as a car that uses gas can go. Or at least these are the obstacles I heard about EVs. Now I had the world tell me in January of 2021 we needed to get a hybrid rav4 so did that back when. I had a feeling January 2021 that gas was going to go up more and over 4 per gallon in the next year or so. Just another hunch or I just say the world tells me things sometimes.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah they definitely have their limits and are not best for many people. Those new RAV4 are slick though! They look like compact 4Runners. The hybrid is good to because you save on gas and as you said, you don't have to wait for a charge.\n\nThe one thing that no one is really talking about though is the amount of platinum going into Tesla batteries.
