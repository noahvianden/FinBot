Which doesn't mean I think that all those comments on reddit are coming from paid trolls, I also think that Musk is very easy to criticize on a lot of things. I'd just guess that there's some conservative think tank out there coming up with anti-Musk talking points, and they're extremely happy to see those taking points getting repeated \"organically\" on reddit and Twitter.\n\nThere's also a lot of investors who bet against Tesla and lost a ton of money and are just bitter. And there's a lot of experts (and arm chair experts) who know how the auto business or aerospace business is *supposed* to work and are bitter that all their predictions from the last 10 years are ending up looking ridiculous.\n\nMusk is turning a lot of things upside down that were supposed to be stable and predictable. And he's not doing it in the mature and respectful way that billionaires are \"supposed\" to act. So there's lots of people who are willing to ignore what he's doing and hop on the band wagon of hating him for the way he's doing it.", "score": 20, "replies": [{"body": "Honestly i dont think that many people actually bet against Tesla.

The thing that frustrates me is the amount of misinformed people that think Elon came from extreme wealth and apartheid money, and that he had everything for himself.\n\nThis is wrong and misunderstood. By in large, Elon is a self made man, he had over 100K in student debt when studying, and he was dirt broke when he first came to Canada. Now that Elon's wealthy these past few years, people automatically think he is so evil, and that he gets everything from the back of his workers. \n\nThe overall sentiment I've seen is that most of these thoughts come from the left. Now I myself lean towards the left to many cases, but rationally speaking, a lot of the right that has common sense, does not think Elon is a bad person and he was born with a golden spoon or some BS. By in large, Elon is a person who did build himself up from basically nothing, and somehow, no one on the left seems to believe that.\n\nThe thing is that, Twitter, in itself these days is silencing a lot of the people who do understand Elon correctly. I like the view that Elon has, in that if you can see stuff on a platform to which you don't agree with, that means the platform endows free speech. I'm sure twitter under Elon will still condemn things like the insurrection and all that, because most of the people on both the left and the right side ended up thinking that was unacceptable, except for a few right-wing radicals.\n\nI think Elon has great potential and a great company to add to the portfolio by buying twitter, and maybe just maybe, he will over time push down the amount to people hating him in some regard, by proving to their rationale that his actions are level-headed and fair.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Engaging in a Twitter fight with Bernie is what flamed this up much more then usual (IMHO).
