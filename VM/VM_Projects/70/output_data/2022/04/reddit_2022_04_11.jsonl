{"title": "Charlie Munger-Tied Daily Journal Slashes Alibaba Stake in Half", "selftext": "> Daily Journal Corp., a newspaper and software business that counts Charlie Munger as one of the overseers of its stock portfolio, cut its stake in Chinese internet giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. by roughly half. \n\n> The Los Angeles-based company owned 300,000 American depositary shares in Alibaba at the end of March, according to a regulatory filing Monday. That\u2019s down from 602,060 at the end of last year.\n\n> For years, Munger led Daily Journal as chairman, in addition to his role as a vice chairman at Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Daily Journal announced in March that the 98-year-old billionaire would step down from that role, but still hold a board seat and \u201ccontinue to pay particular attention to matters with which he has been involved in the past, including the company\u2019s securities portfolio,\u201d according to a regulatory filing at the time. He also said that he would donate $1 million of his stock in the company to create an equity incentive plan. \n\n> Daily Journal is known for its collection of papers and for selling software to customers that include justice agencies and courts. The business also holds a collection of stocks in addition to its operating businesses, similar to Berkshire\u2019s strategy of also investing while owning businesses. Its stock portfolio consisted of five different publicly disclosed investments at the end of March, which includes the Alibaba holding that it first started disclosing a year ago. \n\nSource: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-04-11/charlie-munger-tied-daily-journal-slashes-alibaba-stake-in-half", "id": "u1hb12", "created_utc": 1649710385.0, "score": 42, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 75, "comments": [{"body": "On a side note, does anyone else think Warren and Charlie have access to some billionaire immortality serum that we don't know about yet?

Clearly the stock is trading at a massive discount already, so why would it keep trading at ever more of a discount on the same issue?

I'm fine with people arguing more of a discount is needed, but my point is that at some point it doesn't make sense to continue to discount the same risks and the stock has to begin trading back on fundamentals.\n\nI'll also add that it's interesting that Munger didn't close the position completely. I think he doubled down sometime around Dec and if he recently sold that implies he sold those shares for around cost.
