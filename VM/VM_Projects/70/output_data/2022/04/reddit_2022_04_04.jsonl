Hertz shares were up 1.75% in premarket trading Monday.\n\nHertz in October announced its order to purchase 100,000 electric cars from Tesla Inc, primarily the EV maker's Model 3.\n\nIn March, Hertz added Tesla's mid-size SUV Model Y to its electric vehicle fleet, according to the car rental firm's website.\n\nPolestar, which was founded by China's Geely and Volvo Cars, is set to merge with special purpose acquisition company: Gores Guggenheim Inc, this year.\n\n\nThe Hertz partnership \"will bring the amazing experience of driving an electric car to a wider audience, satisfying a broad variety of our mutual customers' short- and longer-term mobility requirements,\" Polestar CEO Thomas Ingenlath said in a statement.", "id": "twacs4", "created_utc": 1649099712.0, "score": 138, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 76, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|24|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|134|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r0ttot/ggpi_and_why_i_believe_its_the_next_big_thing/) \n**Account Age**|7 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=twacs4)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=twacs4)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.16029700636863708}, {"body": "F it I\u2019m In", "score": 22, "replies": [{"body": "You can\u2019t even trade it you dope", "score": -7, "replies": [{"body": "Gores Guggenheim Inc is the answer -> SPAC", "score": 18, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1730107218027115}, {"body": "He belongs here\u2026", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.10566715151071548}, {"body": "Shit dropped faster than Monica LaWendy's", "score": -1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.19134926795959473}, {"body": "He means buy $F", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3364526629447937}, {"body": "Volvo", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.07929468899965286}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.21429359912872314}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.03152628615498543}, {"body": "Pole star indeed.", "score": 10, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.11422824114561081}, {"body": "Got 1000 shares of gege pipi  @ 11$  cant wait to spend all my 10x gains on my beautiful stock  after the split and buy thousands again", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "Why on earth would they have a 200b market cap", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Because markets are irrational and a casino.\n\nValue investing is dead if you still haven't  gotten the memo... be happy with your 2% etf gains each year", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah there\u2019s value investing and there\u2019s irrational markets and there\u2019s you being completely financially brain dead without any ability to comprehend a company beyond share price", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Damnnn bro this brain dead dude probably outperforms you  without knowledge aswell\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/14T1ClP", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Kinda insecure not responding to anything i stated and just showing a single percentage highlight without asking and without showing a cash amount but ok \ud83d\udc4d", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.18324150145053864}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.20982873439788818}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5413018465042114}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.208065465092659}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.23295649886131287}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1540554016828537}, {"body": "Polestar > LCID > RIVN\n\nTSLA is a very good company with much too high market valuation.
