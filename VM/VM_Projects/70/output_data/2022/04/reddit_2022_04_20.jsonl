This along with the legal confusion likely making the whole much more of an issue than it's worth. [This article goes into the issues a bit](https://europe.autonews.com/guest-columnist/why-industry-considering-leap-ahead-level-4-autonomy), though it starts focusing on why lidar is important for AI vehicles (mainly due to the limitations with L3). \n\nTechnically speaking, Tesla could roll out L3 autonomy first. There's nothing stopping them from doing so. But it simply isn't worth the risk. If L3 cannot handle a situation, it is required to give back driver control with enough time for the driver to react. L4 can do similar, but has the added requirement of making sure that the driver is actually available. If not, the car moves to a safe area. \n\nOn the tech side, L3 isn't a problem. But the legal issues become crazy. How do you know if there is enough time for the driver to react? What if the driver is sleeping or do you have to have sensors to make sure that the driver doesn't sleep? Many other issues come up too, and this causes requirements on the ability of the car making it almost pointless. Look at Mercedes' L3 driving. You can only activated on premapped highways and at speeds of \\~35mph. It's basically only active during rush hour commutes. L2 already does that and more, but doesn't put legal responsibility on the automaker. L2 is better than L3 in all cases except legal responsibility if there is an issue. L4 is better in all cases. \n\nI hope that makes sense.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "1. L3 means the driver doesn\u2019t have to pay attention.

It basically relies on the driver of the vehicle while not always having legal responsibility on the driver. L4 does not rely on a driver at all, but can still be driven by a driver. \n\nI'm having trouble putting the issues into words. Just understand that L3 puts heavy reliance on having a driver available to take over while still having legal responsibility on the automaker. L4 on the other hand never relies on the driver to take over. If you are not good enough to be L4, it is better from a legal and PR perspective to stick to L2.

It's just not legal to do so and you have to bypass the controls, but it is very much possible. \n\nWith L2, manufacturers can get all the data and training that is possible with L3 without the legal issues. Actually, you can get more data and training with L2. Law makers don't have to worry about the what ifs as much with responsibility.

You cannot have it in areas that you are unfamiliar with, so it will greatly reduce training. Same as L4. But L4 is the end goal for the time being. \n4. Most of the current training is due to disengagements and shadow driving. Shadow driving is where the system activates virtually so that it can compare how it would behave vs the driver who is in actual control. \n\nIn both cases of L3 and L4, the system would only activate in areas where they are already confident in the ability of the system and where training data is minimal. L4 can be sold for much more than L3 or L2 and can completely disengage any driver interaction. L3 cannot and therefore has a high amount of liability due to the driver and nearly as high of liability as L4. When it comes down to it, L3 has a negative cost to benefit ratio, while L4 has a positive cost to benefit ratio. And L5 is too far into the future to be counted currently, from my understanding at least.\n\nAnd no need to take my word for it. Tesla is obviously moving forward this way.

{"title": "We have the Japanese Central Bank cornered. Short the Yen (buy $YCS).", "selftext": "**We have the Japanese Central Bank cornered**\n\nThe Japanese Yen has been weakening against the dollar with no stop in sight.\n\nFor the past 20 years, Japan has suffered from massive deflation, and the Japanese Central bank has been the most aggressive major central bank, doing absolutely everything they could think of to spur some inflation. They've literally bought like half of all Japanese stocks just to prop their markets up. And they are currently printing unlimited Yen to buy Japanese government bonds to peg the yields at 0.25%, because they're afraid everything will collapse if they let yields go any higher.\n\nMeanwhile, bond yields in the US have been rising, so capital is fleeing from the JPY (the Yen) into markets like the US to get higher yield.\n\nAnd so the Yen is sliding BIGLY.\n\n[Yen per USD ](https://preview.redd.it/np34poke2ru81.png?width=722&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc7c31e66c568f2fcf82982668d4ad25b7e0f819)\n\n**This is where WE come in.**\n\nDegens. Apes. Autists.\n\nWe can wreak havoc and make fortunes if we all pile in to this trade and short the Yen. The Japanese central bank is cornered and has no power to stop us. They need to keep printing Yen to peg their bond yields.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The trade? Buy $YCS**\n\n(There may be better ways to trade this but here's what I'm doing..)\n\n$YCS is the ProShares UltraShort Yen ETF. So when Yen loses value, $YCS goes UP. And call options on $YCS go up even faster.\n\n(disclaimer: this is an \"Inverse Leveraged\" product, so it's not something you want to hold for a long time, because I think it leaks value in some way, but in the short term it tracks the Yen inversely vs USD).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**This could be epic.**\n\nThis is a potential George Soros vs Bank of England moment in modern times. We have the Japanese Central Bank cornered, and we can crush them if we pile in here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What could go wrong?**\n\nThis trade could falter in the short term if the US Fed gets dovish and tries to weaken the dollar. Remember this trade is Yen vs Dollar so if Dollar weakens, it will help the Yen be stronger relatively.\n\nBut currently the Fed is needing to fight inflation, and seems pretty set on rate hikes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Be safe, have fun, let's go to the moon.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Proof of my positions:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cx9zf0ma6su81.jpg?width=1113&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=38aee95ed313b7036e7f8e9aed06bfc743a3fe2b", "id": "u87140", "created_utc": 1650490168.0, "score": 45, "upvote_ratio": 0.77, "num_comments": 80, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|17 minutes ago\n**Total Comments**|1|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|4 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=u87140)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=u87140)\n    \nHey /u/puffmancali, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "My current positions are Call Options on $YCS at various strikes dated 5/20\n\nhttps://imgur.com/eh58hcB", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1940145641565323}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.20370757579803467}, {"body": ">We can wreak havoc and make fortunes if we all pile in to this trade and short the Yen.
