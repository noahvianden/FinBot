{"title": "HP\u2019s stock rockets after Berkshire Hathaway reveals 11% stake", "selftext": "Shares of HP Inc. surged in after-hours trading Wednesday after Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. disclosed that it had taken a large stake in the Silicon Valley maker of personal computers and printers. \n\nBerkshire BRK.A, +0.19% BRK.B, -0.03% disclosed in a late Wednesday filing that it owned 120.95 million shares of HP HPQ, -3.03% after buying shares in recent days. That position is worth about $4.2 billion and represents a roughly 11% stake in the company. The stock rose nearly 10% in after-hours trading.\n\n\u201cHP is committed to one of the largest share-repurchase programs (relative to market cap) within our coverage, so we think Berkshire\u2019s involvement makes sense,\u201d Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani wrote in a note to clients.\n\nWhile he said he didn\u2019t believe that Berkshire\u2019s investment in HP would drive significant changes to HP\u2019s business, he deemed the high-profile stake a \u201cvalidation of HPQ\u2019s strategy/capital return program,\u201d noting that Berkshire began purchasing shares after HP announced plans to purchase the workplace-technologies company Poly for $3.3 billion late last month.\n\nBerkshire\u2019s HP stake indicates that Buffett sees value in HP\u2019s business, though several analysts have sounded cautious lately on the market for personal computers following a pandemic-driven boom.\n\n\u201cSpecifically, we believe PC and consumer hardware spending will be pressured as supply improves and demand normalizes after two years of above-trend growth,\u201d Morgan Stanley\u2019s Erik Woodring wrote in explaining his March 31 downgrades of HP and Dell Inc.
