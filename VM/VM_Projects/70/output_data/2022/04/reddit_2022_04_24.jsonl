Block updated its bylaws to reflect Dorsey\u2019s new role, removing the requirement for the company to have an officer holding the titles of CEO and president.\n\nIt\u2019s yet another way that Dorsey is intersecting with Tesla\u2019s [Elon Musk](https://www.cnbc.com/elon-musk/), who is [trying](https://carbon.cnbc.com/107049558) to buy [Twitter](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/TWTR), the other company that Dorsey co-founded and used to run. Last year, Musk [took on](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/15/elon-musk-officially-made-the-technoking-of-tesla.html) the title of \u201cTechnoking of Tesla,\u201d although he still continues as CEO. Musk later said his position as CEO was \u201ca made-up title.\u201d\n\nDorsey has made similar comments at least as far back as 2012, when he tweeted, \u201cTitles, like \u2018CEO\u2019, get in the way of doing the right thing.

Every other metric they can tailor however the heck they want.  And the only thing they can do wrong is something that will tank subscriber count.  So far, ever since 2013, Netflix has had a steady rise of subscribers.  The rate has been increasing, nearly linear, and largely unaffected by most everything else going on, including rate changes(which they do all the time), password sharing changes (has happened more than once already), whatever crap shows or cancelations that people want to complain about, and even new entries into the market space.  None of it has actually mattered because subscribers keep going up along a largely flat curve, regardless of all this stuff.\n\nOnly one other streaming service on the market is growing faster than Netflix, and that's Disney+.

Otherwise Netflix has had the most total subscribers by a large margin and a stronger growth slope than everything else.\n\nSo where are they not a growth company and stock?\n\nRevenue has grown steadily and has not flatlined or tapered off.\n\nSo why again is not a growth company?\n\nOk, do we look at PE then?  Well, that's kind of crap because it's never really been an uptrend.  It's been a downward slope the whole time.  So PE has been some of the best it's ever been and has averaged higher than its current value for a long time.  Even the PE at the down turn was the lowest it's ever been, so it had already been the best price to earnings ratio ever before it tanked.\n\nMaybe it's earnings?\n\nThis looks to be the only case where lower earnings were met with a stock price downturn.  BUT, a rise back up did not.  Again, revenue is just rolling in, and all it is just choices in where those dollars are going to various projects.  For some reason, it seems people are freaking out about them actually spending some cash on project.  But even that's incorrect.  October of 2021 before the stock crashed, earnings was 3.2 million.  Great!  Among the best it's had ever.  Then the stock crashed.  O...kay...  The following earnings was 1.3 million for end of Dec.  But that wasn't outside of normal ranges for many previous quarters.  Sure crash the stock, whatever.  Now comes Q1 of 2022 earnings and, bam 3.5 million again, near record levels.  Yay!  Right?  No, the stock crashed again.  Why?\n\nLike there are zero metrics here that show why the stock is tanking.  Great subscribes, dominating the market, great revenue, great PE, everything.

If your trading style depends on probabilities, then having consistent trades will help.**\n\n**EDIT2: Thanks** u/soulivore **for pointing this out, my bad writing probably gave the wrong impression here. \"Applying any strategy on any stock and doing it consistently will work\" is never my intention. I hope people don't take this away and trade like that without their own research.**\n\n**I will try to be more careful and explicit next time I post something here, sorry for the confusion!**\n\nI have been trading options for 6 yrs now. Still wouldn't call myself an expert. The 35% ROI is a real number but this post is not about bragging. I like to share some of my observations. If this post can help at least 1 person, I achieve my goal :)\n\nThe name of the trading strategy is called **\"consistency\".**\n\nIt actually doesn't matter what Option strategy you use, but you need to do it consistently, and stick to the ones that you are most familiar and comfortable with. It has to be a strategy that's proven to work with your trading style. Long calls and puts are okay too if they work for you. (I know we are thetagang, but we are also here to make money.)\n\n**Law of Large Numbers (LLN)**\n\nEven a 90% win rate doesn't mean you'll make money on your first few trades. We need to consistently put on trades to have a large enough occurrence for the LLN to work.\n\nHowever, be selective of your trades, and **don't over-trade**.\n\n**Consistent Risk Profile**\n\nLet's say we usually trade 1 contract of SPY, we have been on a winning streak and got cocky, now let's try maybe 5 contracts in one trade. Remember, each trade has a chance to blow up. And it's very likely that your first scaled-up trade will blow up on you. This is when we lose months and years of previous profits.\n\nIt's okay to scale up, but do it slowly. Complete a few trades and get comfortable with the new trade size & risk profile, then scale up again if you feel it's the right thing to do.\n\n**Simplicity Wins (sometimes)**\n\nThis is a personal preference so it's up to you to decide what works best for you. I prefer simple strategies because they are easy to understand and manage. They are also less mentally exhausting to deal with. Of course, YMMV and more complex strategies might work better for you, I have a friend that likes to do a 12-leg strategy for earning plays apparently it works for him, but too much for me.\n\n**Time To Reveal My Secret Strategy**\n\nIt's short put and I'm serious :) It might sound boring to many, but it works. If you have to ask the stock ticker, it's TSLA. The only thing I've traded so far in 2022 is short put in TSLA. You don't have to pick TSLA and other stocks work too. Sorry maybe not NFLX or FB... \"for now\". Other option strategies work too, if you have been doing e.g. short calls on most tech stocks, I'm sure it's been very profitable this year.\n\nThe key point is about **staying consistent** with what works for you, option strategies actually don't matter too much.\n\n**Longer Time Horizon**\n\n35% in the first four months doesn't mean anything and it's not important. Anyone can just pick a period and claim they've made xx% return during that time. NLFX and FB might be -50% now, but they'll recover given time, and probably will raise even higher. Focus on the long-term goal, and don't get distracted by the short-term %s **if you have done your research and believe in the company.**\n\nHappy trading and stay safe!", "id": "ual9xs", "created_utc": 1650769147.0, "score": 21, "upvote_ratio": 0.6, "num_comments": 76, "comments": [{"body": "TLDR: TSLA Bull writes us a letter", "score": 30, "replies": [{"body": "For some reason, I can't edit my post.\n\nMaybe I didn't make it clear, but my point was that it doesn't matter what options strategies, or stocks you use. \n\nIf your trading style depends on probabilities, then stick to your plan and be consistent with your trades.

Short puts work really well when the stock is somewhere between bull and flat, like TSLA was. This isn't a rhetorical question, I'm honestly curious: would your strategy have worked over the past 12 months on ZM?\n\nThe \"probabilities\" that you speak of are derived from the fact that IV usually exceeds realized volatility. Again, picking TSLA was a good play here, as IV on that stock is always nuts, so that psychological effect is working more in your favor here than it would have if you had, say, sold calls on some utility company over the past year. But again, it's not enough for IV to be high. I've lost money selling options on stocks with 200%, 300%, even 700% one time with AMC. So I don't think it's fair to say that you made money PURELY because you were trading \"on probabilities,\" you made money because you did a good job researching a stock to be bullish on, and then you applied a bullish strategy that had some probability in your favor.\n\nThe problem that I and, I believe, everyone else has is that you're implying that you could make money by appling any strategy on any ticker at any time, as long as you apply it consistently. It doesn't take long to find counterexamples to this. What if you had sold TSLA calls instead? I think the takeaway from your post is that consistency is not enough--you have to do research. If you're the type of person who doesn't like doing research or who isn't 100% successful with their research (like myself), then you need to diversify in order to win purely with the probabilities of selling high-IV options.\n\nAnd I think the other problem folks are having is the \"I can do it so you can do it too\" attitude that implies that there was never really any doubt that your strategy would have succeeded. The fact is, even when you do a great job with research, you can still be wrong on the direction of a stock sometimes. You happened to be right about your research this time.
