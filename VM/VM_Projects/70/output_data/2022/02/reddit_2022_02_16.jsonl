Some of the world's largest e-commerce brands have moved their entire websites over to Shopify. I work in software development. Shopify made several key moves last year that will allow others to do the same with the platform:\n\nThey sunsetted the god-awful Liquid framework in favor of a new, [React-based language called Hydrogen.](https://hydrogen.shopify.dev/) A lot of R&D dollars went into this, reflected in the earnings report. \n\nWhy would an established e-commerce brand move their custom-built site to a platform like Shopify, you might ask? Let me answer: building software is fucking expensive. A decent U.S.-based software engineer will set you back a minimum of $150k per year. That's before you add in the project managers, product managers, designers, DevOps engineers, backend engineers, site reliability engineers, and everything else you need to keep a modern web application going. Add all these salaries up - then consider that nearly every engineer is an autistic monkey that needs to be fed Red Bull and pizza every hour otherwise they start eating glue - and realize that it doesn't make sense for Skims or Savage Fenty or Goop or any of these other stupid ass brands to keep a software development team on staff. That millions of dollars the company is wiping its ass with every year. \n\nGuess who solves these problems? Shopify. Build it once, they maintain it for you. On top of that you get a dashboard of pretty analytics about your business that you can show to your wife's boyfriend while he's railing her. \n\nShopify is also integrated with literally every other e-commerce player.
