{"title": "Taxable wheeling on margin", "selftext": "I like wheel fundamentally but dislike CSPs.  Cash earns -7.5% right now (inflation) so I don't find it useful as collateral on puts.  Unless you make 7.5% annualized on your puts after tax, CSPs are losing money.\n\nI would rather put up bond ETFs, stocks or gold ETF as collateral for margin.  I would favor that these puts and collateral do not all collapse together if the market tanks, as this would increase the chance of margin call.  I've been looking at asset correlation matrices for this.  In particular I sell a lot of TSLA puts and calls.\n\nI would intend to never get assigned on the naked puts or covered calls; would roll my way out.  This would preserve buying power and avoid interest on the put side.  On the call side, it would avoid selling stock and paying taxes on unrealized gains.  So this is the equivalent of long stock and moving around a short strangle, avoiding assignment.\n\nAnyone do this?  I've read terms notional value, notional leverage and have some understanding of them.  My options are level 4, account about $1M and I consider myself intermediate to advanced in stocks and options.  PMs welcome.
