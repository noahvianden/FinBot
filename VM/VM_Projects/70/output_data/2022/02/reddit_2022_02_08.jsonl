{"title": "Is Tyson Foods Overrated?", "selftext": "Am I the only one that thinks Tyson Foods is  heavly overrated, the dozen subsidary companies they have to hide their name do not do well in retail, they are a big producer for at least McDonalds which their revenue is very poor compared to previous years and they have the same trend but lesser, taking more personal profit than they have increased revenue, the 100+% take in personal profit but only an 11% revenue increase especially considering increase in imports/exports, taxes, inflation, new laws that require more internal spending\u2026I feel like the numbers don\u2019t add up. They even delayed earnings by 24 hours. They have spent over 50 million dollars in hush money from environmental pollution in midwestern states to animal protection groups and companies that have exposed and won trials for their cruelty as well as pay offs of individuals and groups of individuals to remain quiet\u2026the whole company seems sketchy. The chart is forming a, to me, classic fishing rod and it just established the hook. Does anyone else believe puts would be a solid play for after earning reports? I hate tyson personally. I would never eat their products and in general I see deals at my local walmart\u2019s for tyson chicken meaning for current established base prices for all poultry, tyson underperforms, people only buy it when it\u2019s cheap. Meaning\u2026tyson chicken is cheap so doesn\u2019t that mean the stock should at least be in the 80\u2019s? Does anyone truly believe investing into Tyson Foods would bring profit in a hypothetical 5 year or decade long hold? I see more money being made off puts or big companies shorting it. Vanguard and BlackRock own majority shares it is also 87% owned by institutions. I don\u2019t think this company will hold i\u2019m deciding on puts or shorting it but I want to see what other people think. I am currently banned from WSB for 2 more days. I will be doing more research and posting their shortly. Please let me know what you think. Nobody, HF\u2019s nor insiders have bought Tyson since the new year. I feel like this is a sign of weak company support for this year. Plus the HF\u2019s that do own it are known for pulling sketchy stuff and hurting the retail traders that follow them. 1,066 positions have been closed since the new year. Only 602 have been bought and only 229 have been help 831:1066 intake to outtake is, in my opinion, extremely poor for the scatter to buy natural resource companies that has been occurring. I also notice ETF\u2019s that hold tyson are generally avoided compared to other ETF\u2019s that are beginning to grow. They also release dividends on a 3 month basis yet have failed to deliver or announce one for this month.\n\n[Tysons Potential Downspout to 90](https://imgur.com/a/Xgd5dwd)\n\nIn this photo is the trend lines set that have been proven in the stocks history.

{"title": "If You Cannot Beat Them, Join Them - Congress Trading & Retail Traders", "selftext": "Just wrote a blog post at [Tradytics](https://tradytics.com) and thought it's worth sharing here to let retail know what's going on.\n\n2021 was a great year for the market as [SPY](https://tradytics.com/stocks-dashboard?ticker=SPY)  rallied about 25%, which is significantly more than its average yearly  return. Many traders made money, but there was one group that made more  than most of us, and that was the group of US politicians. In 2012, the [STOCK ACT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STOCK_Act)  was introduced to prevent the members of congress from using any  insider information to make trades, and require them to report their  trades within 45 days.\n\nWe are not sure how much is the rule followed these days by the members  of congress, but what we have seen over the last few years is how well  members of congress have been doing [extremely well](https://nypost.com/2022/01/07/nancy-pelosi-makes-30-million-from-tech-stocks-scoffs-at-push-to-ban-congressional-trades/)  in terms of their performance in the markets. This could either be just  a coincidence, or they have more information than an average Joe.  Whatever the case is, the purpose of this post is to help retail traders  follow the congress trades to also earn profits like them.\n\n## Congress Trades\n\nSince the STOCK ACT requires the members of congress to report their  trades within 45 days, we want to find a way we can  leverage those trades to find some edge in the markets. As soon as a new  trade by one of the members of congress is reported, we publish it in our [Congress Market Dashboard](https://tradytics.com/senate-market) shown below.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6h8rtk99wig81.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e51c5f81c661c86a30c88466de8495d93de2d06\n\nThis is every single trade that gets reported - one way we can think  about leveraging them is by simply taking the same trade. However, there  are a couple of issues there. First, not all members of the congress  outperform the market indices every year, only a few do. Second, these  trades are delayed by upto 45 days. Sometimes, the stock might have  already made a big move when they are reported, we want to be careful of  that. Finally, different amounts of money are spent on these trades,  and we want to weight them accordingly. The screenshot below shows the  top trades made by congressmen and women - millions of dollars going  into a trade should signify that these people are very confident in  their trades, and we should be okay in following them. Keeping these  limitations in mind, we try to solve them and end up with a solution.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dr1g8bjawig81.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=7bc86ed2285efa280d2150ce35de73d9c40735e5\n\n## Congress ETF\n\nLooking at the historical data, we came up with a few observations.  First, many congress trades have a long time period i.e congressmen and  women do not enter into trades and exit immediately. This fixes the  issue of the 45 day delay although it does impact us somewhat in case  the stock has already made a big move before the report. Second, there  are many smaller trades and it is hard to use them well. When  significant money is being put into a trade, we want to weigh it more,  as it provides us more confidence. Finally, we want to be able to update  our picks as new data comes in. Based on these three observations, we  developed what we call a [Congress ETF](https://tradytics.com/senate-etf) that combines congress trades in an intelligent manner and outperforms SPY.\n\nAt every day, the congress ETF takes the top 100 trades based on  their value and assigns them weights proportional to the amount that  went into the trade. The weights of the symbols are considered their  allocation, and it changes every day as new trades come in. Sold  positions are automatically removed from the ETF once they are reported.  Based on this dynamic allocation of symbols, we construct an ETF called  Congress ETF. Before diving into more details, let us first take a look  at the performance of the ETF and compare it to SPY.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q5wuo8tbwig81.png?width=1550&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf3bf4d88e81dd63240369cb6745e87b17c50934\n\nLooking at the chart above, we can see that the Congress ETF outperforms [SPY](https://tradytics.com/stocks-dashboard?ticker=SPY) by a factor of 2, which means it's twice as good as [SPY](https://tradytics.com/stocks-dashboard?ticker=SPY). If you've traded for a while, you would know that beating the markets i.e [SPY](https://tradytics.com/stocks-dashboard?ticker=SPY)  is not an easy job, especially on a consistent basis. Now that we've  seen the performance, the question you as readers would have is how can  you actually use the ETF to earn money.\n\n## How do I follow Congress ETF?\n\nIn our [Congress ETF](https://tradytics.com/senate-etf),  we keep a chart that shows the allocation of each symbol in the  portfolio. All trades are long trades, and the chart on average updates  every 1-2 weeks, since not many large trades are frequently made by the  congressmen and women. For instance, an example allocation could be MSFT  (40%) and AAPL (60%) which would mean if you have a 1000 dollars, you  should buy shares worth 400 dollars for Microsoft and worth 600 for  Apple. The chart below shows the allocation of symbols over time. There  are about 47 symbols in the ETF right now, but if that is a large number  for you, you can also pick up the top 10 symbols based on their bar  size in the chart\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qxvoro4dwig81.png?width=1550&format=png&auto=webp&s=2efc1622e322d365ca220f5d51c487f92bf189ab\n\nIf you look at the allocation chart, you can see how each new bar  comes after a week or two. That's because very large trades are rarely  made by politicians's, but whenever they are, we pick them right away,  and readjust the ETF. In future, we might automate and allow you to  simply do one click and put a fixed amount of money in the entire ETF.  But right now, the process is somewhat tedious and manual.\n\n## Congressmen & Women ETF\n\nAs we discussed, the Congress ETF at the time of writing this  contains about 47 symbols, which can sometimes be too much to follow for  a retail user. In order to fix that, we also allow users to analyze  individual congressmen and women's portfolios. We employ a similar  process as described earlier on the construct the ETF, but on average,  there are at most 5-10 names in every politician's portfolio, making it  easy for retail traders to follow. But which members of the congress  should we follow? That's a good question and needs answering first.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e8qgcn9ewig81.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=78f58a30d311f644be9b130c4fc13651cec7ad17\n\nThe chart above shows the average performance of each traded taken by  the best performing congressmen and women. If you've read the news  lately, it is no surprise to see the great Nancy Pelosi in there,  because she did quite well [last year](https://nypost.com/2022/01/07/nancy-pelosi-makes-30-million-from-tech-stocks-scoffs-at-push-to-ban-congressional-trades/).  These are the people that we want to follow. Now let us take a look at  Nancy's portfolio and see how easy it is at Tradytics to follow her  trades.\n\n## Nancy Pelosi ETF\n\nIn order to get the dashboard for individual members of congress, you can head over to our [Individual Congress Dashboard](https://tradytics.com/senate-individual).  The default search is already for Nancy Pelosi, so we will dive right  into her portfolio. The figure below shows her ETF performance, symbol  allocation, and the times when readjustments were made to the portfolio.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1z9bs9ifwig81.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=995e3c0b2f430147f6dbae3212e4f0834dffc6b6\n\nLooking at the screenshot above, the first thing to note is that  although the congress ETF beat SPY by about 2x, the Nancy ETF actually  beat it by 2.6x which shows how good she has been trading lately. The  more important graph is the lower one that shows the allocation of each  symbol in her portfolio at every day the readjustments were made. In  contrast to the congress ETF, there are only about 10-11 symbols in her  portfolio and she only made new trades about a dozen times in the last  year, which is very manageable for retail traders as well. It is easy  for us to keep an eye on her positions in the [dashboard](https://tradytics.com/senate-individual) and follow them whenever they are reported.\n\n## Limitations & Final Thoughts\n\nMost people believe that the 45 day delay in reporting causes some  limitations in trying to follow congress trades. As discussed earlier,  that is obviously true to some extent but retail traders can still  follow positions even after that delay, and still be able to earn  similar profits as the members of congress. If you go ahead and take a  look at the trades tables in the dashboards, you will actually see that  many of the positions had not moved much before they were reported to  the public. That is also a criteria that you can use to follow trades -  only go into the ones that haven't moved much at the time of reporting.  Despite some of the limitations, we believe Congress trading is a good  source of generating alpha in the markets and can help retail traders  find an edge. As always, please always do your due diligence before  going into a trade, stay safe, and manage risk.

One could literally imagine anything under the sun breaking securities laws, telling a sitting U.S. Senator he looks like he came, and criticizing the government heavily. However, it is interesting to note that Musk hardly ever mentions China in almost any negative light. It's almost as if a majority of his production relies on the whims of an image obsessed regime. \n\nIt is well known that to gain access to the profit laden Chinese market you sacrifice your first born sons left nut and every ounce of intellectual property. The intellectual property that isn't handed over willingly is probably just stolen too. Now there is one thing that China loves more then stealing other peoples intellectual property, and that is creating near knockoffs with that intellectual property.
