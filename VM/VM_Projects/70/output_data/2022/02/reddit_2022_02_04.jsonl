Doesn\u2019t matter if you quit using FB and start using Instagram. They will still get your eyeball and that's dollar.\n\n2. FB has WhatsApp. Which is slowly creating monetization opportunities in developing countries. It could a be bigger cash cow than Instagram even.\n\n3. FB based Marketplace and Meta's continuous integration of similar selling services will ultimately be the biggest cash cow of FB.\n\n4. Stonks go down, stonks will go up. We can buy the dip.\n\n5. FB has much, much better fundamentals than the overall market. TTM P/E is much lower compared to S&P 500 index (though P/E doesn\u2019t mean jackshit).\n\nIndebtedness much lower, growth gonna be higher in the long run, and the most important thing: FCF is much better compared to the overall market.\n\nNow, tell me this. We can gamble on SPY call options, buy VOO. Yet, we cannot do that for FB? Buy FB stonks?\n\nDon\u2019t give me that look. Don't tell me it\u2019s morally bankrupt or some shit. Every company in the index is the same. Weapons manufacturers, oil giants, banks,  real estate speculator companies, those soft drinks companies etc. Which one is not harming society?\n\nMoreover, when such a giant drops 20%+ in a single day, you know it\u2019s a knee-jerk reaction from the market, you know it will be back up pretty soon as long as the overall market doesn\u2019t crush.\n\nEdit: I haven\u2019t yet opened any position in FB, will open it tomorrow and add the position screenshot in this post after that.\nI do have traded a very small position in FB a little before the earnings call though.

{"title": "Why you should pull your finger out of your ass about $COIN", "selftext": "In this post I'll try to explain to you degens why Coinbase is actually a high growth tech company, and not some exchange that will become irrelevant in 3-5 years.\n\nLet's ignore revenue from trading fees (89%) of Coinbase' revenue in Q3.\n\nAND let's ignore the upcoming \"expensive jpeg\" (I know that's not the only use case, fuck off) marketplace.\n\nLet's just focus on subscription & services revenue, which made up the other 11% of revenue from Q3.\n\nHere's what you need to know. the average quarter over quarter growth rate for their subscription and services revenue over the last 4 quarters is 97.34%.\n\nYes (in millions $, Q3'2020 - Q3'2021): 10.7 > 20.7 > 56.4 > 102.6 > 145.2.\n\nNow, you might say, millions is nothing for a company with a $40B market cap. Why are we talking about this?\n\nHere's why: Q3 posed 41.5% growth in S&S revenue quarter over quarter, and this was during a \"winter\" where trading volumes were down 30% quarter over quarter. I propose that this means regardless of asset prices, institutions (primarily) are continuing to invest into this new asset class.\n\nAnd that this category of revenue is going to CONTINUE to grow exponentially for the foreseeable future. Coinbase is the best positioned to serve the needs of existing institutional entities as well as startups that want to get involved in this space. And I see no competition coming.\n\nAlso, even if there was competition, guess what - Coinbase would probably be an investor, and probably acquire them. Their Venture arm has invested more than $26B in various \"decentralized web technology companies in 2021)\n\nAnalysts are expecting Coinbase revenue & earnings to decline substantially in 2022. I think for one thing, that Q4'2021 may surprise to the upside on higher than expected growth in the S&S category of revenue (since trading volumes are public data, there's not much room for surprise).\n\nFurthermore, I think that 2022 is going to be another explosive year of adoption in all aspects of this space.\n\nWe'll talk about valuations next. Now, we can't ignore revenue from trading fee's here. So keep that in mind. But I like to think of revenue from trading fees much like the tax credits Tesla received that made them profitable originally. They may be temporary, but they are giving the company a really strong financial foundation to stand on. But let's try to price this company based on the underlying growth, with the understanding that the balance sheet is exceptionally  healthy.\n\nGiven their Q3 S&S revenue of $145M, up by \\~1300% from Q3 of 2020... We'll to be honest, I started writing this section with the intent of proving they deserved a certain multiple, but I'm kinda retarded, so I'll leave that to somebody else. But I ASSERT that a P/E of \\~16 (as it stands today) is too damn low. And - oh - by the way - after they report Q4 earnings it should be closer to 13.\n\nYes - If they have a record breaking quarter (they will), but, let's for simplicity assume they match Q2 (less the tax credit they cashed in Q2 which pumped their earnings \\~$737M, and I might be missing something here but I'm doing the conservative thing) that would leave them with Q4 net income of $869M. Which would put their yearly EPS at $13.9. Which only edges out consensus to the upside by \\~5%.\n\nSo if consensus is so on-the-nose, again, what are we talking about?\n\nWell consensus is only coincidentally on the nose, because S&S revenue is only ramping up. An extra $100M here or there doesn't mean a lot to Coinbase' earnings today. But by the end of 2022, they could be doing closer to $1B (roughly 4x on the +$200M I expect to see in Q4 earnings) in S&S revenue each quarter. Do I know where the growth stops? no I do not. Which is why I'm bullish as fuck.\n\nAnd again, analyst consensus is that Coinbase revenue declines in 2022 and beyond. I think there will be a tidal wave of price target raises somewhere between Q2 & Q3 of this year.\n\nAll of this to say that in the face of overwhelming evidence, analysts will have to raise price targets and somewhere along the way, wall street will realize Coinbase is a high growth tech company that deserves a growth multiple. Revenue diversification isn't coming, it's here, and it's sneaking up on everybody who doesn't understand why Coinbase should be worth more than Nasdaq.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNo TLDR for you. $505 C 1/20/2023.\n\nPosition: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/s81l6k/77k\\_505\\_c\\_leaps\\_on\\_coin\\_update\\_trials\\_and/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/s81l6k/77k_505_c_leaps_on_coin_update_trials_and/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)", "id": "sk3bb0", "created_utc": 1643946330.0, "score": 66, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "num_comments": 70, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|3|**First Seen In WSB**|6 months ago\n**Total Comments**|27|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|6 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=sk3bb0)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=sk3bb0)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I was tracking until you said $505.
