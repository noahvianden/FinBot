{"title": "She said it...Fed\u2019s Mester doesn\u2019t see \u2018compelling case\u2019 for half percentage point rate hike in March", "selftext": "The Federal Reserve doesn\u2019t have to start hiking its policy interest rate with a big 50 basis point move, said Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester on Wednesday. In a virtual address to the European Economics and Financial Center in London, Mester made clear that she supports rate hikes this year, beginning in at the next meeting on March 16, given the high inflation readings and strong labor market.\n\n\u201cThe task before us is to remove accommodation at the pace necessary to bring inflation under control,\u201d Mester said.\n\nSome on Wall Street have raised the possibility that the Fed would raise rates in March by 50 basis points, but Mester said she didn\u2019t see a \u201ccompelling case\u201d for such a large move. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to be a little careful. Because\u2026even though you can well telegraph sort of what\u2019s coming, when you take the that first action, you know there\u2019s going to be a reaction,\u201d she said.\n\nLooking at the terminal rate \u2014 where the Fed\u2019s policy rate rise will be the last one in the rate hiking cycle \u2014 Mester said that with the economy doing so strongly, the Fed might have to raise rates above neutral \u2013 which is estimated at a 2.5% policy rate.\n\nMoving above 2.5% would mean that policy is aiming to restrict economic growth. This is not the \u201csoft landing\u201d scenario for the economy envisioned by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell at his press conference after the last Fed meeting in January.\n\nFull story here- [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/feds-mester-wants-faster-pace-of-rate-hikes-than-in-last-tightening-cycle-in-2015-2018-11644426437?mod=newsviewer\\_click](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/feds-mester-wants-faster-pace-of-rate-hikes-than-in-last-tightening-cycle-in-2015-2018-11644426437?mod=newsviewer_click)", "id": "sokwt8", "created_utc": 1644432798.0, "score": 133, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 79, "comments": [{"body": "They should just tell people they are thinking about 1% that way a .5% increase is good news.", "score": 69, "replies": [{"body": "Yup, now they better not do a 50 point jump in March or the market could freak out.  6 increases of 25 points over the year seems like an increasingly fair expectation.", "score": 5, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.25690191984176636}, {"body": "Just wait", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.14240212738513947}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.19264596700668335}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 47, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 24, "replies": [{"body": "I'm forgetting what the Fed's mandate was.
