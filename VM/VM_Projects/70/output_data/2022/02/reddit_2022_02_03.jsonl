{"title": "Peculiar option behavior on AMZN Calls", "selftext": "First off, I am not looking for advice on trading options, but rather I am looking for some insight into why this option contract is behaving the way it is. I have never seen a contract act like this before.\n\nThe option I will use for an example here is \n\n   AMZN 2/11/22 3250c \n\nYesterday (2/2):  \n\n* This contract opened trading around $30. \n* AMZN stock price at open was around $3060. \n* The lowest dip in option value was around 11:20am when it went down around $20. \n* This coincided with AMZN's dropping about 2.5% to around $3000/share.\n\nFast forward to today:\n\n* Overnight AMZN dropped over 5% and \n* the corresponding AMZN 2/11/22 3250c dropped over 33% on the open. \n* Throughout today AMZN has slowly dropped 1.5% since the open (share price \\~$2850).\n*  YET the CALL option has been increasing all day and has gained 35% since opening!\n\nThe price of the AMZN 2/11/22 3250c contract right now (1:15pm) is \\~$22.50 and AMZN share price is \\~$2810. \n\nYESTERDAY the contract was less than that @ \\~$21.50, while the share price of AMZN was at $3000! So AMZN has lost over 6% since then yet my contract is worth MORE??\n\nWHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON???\n\nNot sure if you can tell but my knowledge of options is very limited, however I have enough experience to know that this is not normal. I assume it has to do with the volatility of the market right now coupled with AMZN earnings later today, but it just seems very counterintuitive to me.

{"title": "AMZN Could Fly On Earnings", "selftext": "This is why I'm betting AMZN does well on earnings today AH! \n\nFor starters, AMZN is down 6.85% at the time of writing this today, meaning, the market is already scared with what happened to (FB, NFLX, PYPL, etc...) and many investors are getting out in an effort to protect themselves if AMZN blows earnings. So, a bad earnings could be partially priced in with this decline. \n\nSecond, AMZN blew earnings last quarter (Q3 '21) when they had a 59.4% decline in Net Income forcing a small sell off back in Oct of last year.  Now, their expectations are 50% lower than they were in Q4 of '20 ($7 EPS vs. $3.67 EPS for this quarter) so much of their slower growth/high transport cost has been priced in. \n\nThird, their stock is already down nearly 26% from its November high, so the likelihood of another massive correction like we saw with FB/NFLX is unlikely since investors have already sold off.  While, there is always room to go down more, if AMZN offers any kind of positive guidance, I believe the stock will do very well! \n\ntl;dr\n\nWhile this is still a risky play since investors have not been kind to slowing growth of these companies, AMZN has done a lot of bleeding already, their EPS estimates are in the trash, and everyone is already fearful of whats to come.
