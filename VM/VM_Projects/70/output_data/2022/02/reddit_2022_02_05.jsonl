{"title": "Betting on Justin Trudeau's dedication to maintaining the housing bubble", "selftext": "**Skippable intro:**\n\nCanada is a great country. It is full of moose, beavers, natural resources and overpriced houses. If you are a mining company looking for an easy place to IPO or a maybe who wants 0 international oversight Canada is a great place for you. If you want to launder money through one of the top three hottest housing markets in the world, send your money to Canada, and Justin Trudeau will be happy to scrub it clean for you, and he\u2019ll keep it safe while he\u2019s at it. Every Canadian administration has bent over backwards to ensure the bubble never pops and this one is no different.\n\n**Why Canada will never increase its interest rate:**\n\nThe Bank of Canada is at complete mercy of the Fed for all of its policy. As our main trading partner if our dollars get out of synch it puts Canada at a major disadvantage. If the US has high inflation and Canada keeps theirs low, all of a sudden Canadian buying power starts looking good, but our exports become too expensive and the US will find another way to get our products.\n\nSo far Canada has been reporting inflation significantly lower to our big brother in the south flirting with 5% rather than 7%. (How realistic either of these numbers are who can say.) Either way, Canada has some wiggle room with respect to their interest rate hikes that the BoC said might be coming last month and didn't. Now they're saying they for sure might be coming in March.\n\nI do not expect Canada to raise interest rates in March regardless of what the FED does (although I am skeptical there as well). I expect that Canada will continue to shelter their home owners, who have taken out a record amount of personal debt in the form of 5 year fixed mortgages. (That's what banks offer here. You can negotiate a longer term but its often quite expensive.) While I believe that the housing market has priced in that no rates hikes are coming, I do not think that the long term bond market has.\n\n**The move:**\n\nCall options on the VAB (Canadian bond ETF). If anyone else has a US Ticker, or another way to play let me know. The VAB is down around 7% in the last 6 months in anticipation of rate hikes. The other appealing catalyst would be if the bears are right and the TNX hits 2.0 then dumps to negative, VAB will rip as rates crash because again BoC will always mirror the FED on major changes to policy.\n\n**Positions:**\n\nI haven\u2019t opened a position yet because I\u2019m jacked to the tits with spy puts and VIX calls for the next leg of the bear market next week, but this week I\u2019ll start loading up on near the money VAB calls dated for early April.  I'll post an update with my positions if this makes it past the mods and anybody bothers to read the whole thing.\n\n**TL:DR:**\n\nCanada\u2019s foreign friends and wealthy boomer voters have no interest in rate hikes that could affect their portfolios of multi-million dollar bungalows in Oakville and shitty overpriced garbage in wastelands like Guelph ON. The BoC will not be raising rates as promised and the Canadian bond market is going to rally. My bet is calls on VAB (Canadian bond ETF) with an April expiry. \n\nHere\u2019s a link to [my last play](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r7rjak/gambling_my_kids_christmas_present_money_on_corn/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) which has worked out pretty well so far.
