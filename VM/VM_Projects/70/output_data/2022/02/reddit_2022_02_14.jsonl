Plus, in competitive gameplay, you want MORE FPS than resolution. Which is why 2550x1440 is more than double the 4k numbers and the majority of gamers are still running in 1080p. It's all about the frames per second, not chasing after a gimmick.\n\n4k in gaming is still a \"gimmick\", because you are highly unlikely to be netting more than a consistent 60 to almost 90fps at 4k, but you could be throwing down 144 to 170fps at 2550x1440 or obscenely high, 210+ fps at 1080p, which in competitive gameplay is the difference between wiping out a whole room of foes or seeing the foes, just to late. This is one of the reasons why cross-platform play between Consoles and PC Desktops, generally goes bad for console players, a console running 4k could be limited to 60 or 120 FPS, while a PC running at 1080p is going to be throwing 244fps at the screen and independent testing has proven that more FPS results in faster player response times.\n\n\"They\" have been trying to make the Gimmick of VR into something ubiquitous for some 20 years now.

{"title": "Big cloud winner will be based on who can make the best custom ARM chip", "selftext": "In the past, AMD and Intel made all the server chips. There's very little to differentiate between AWS, Google Cloud, Azure except for scale and execution. They all ran the exact same Intel Xeon and AMD Epyc chips.\n\nThat all changed when Amazon started prioritizing their Graviton2 ARM chip. In 2020, [50% of all new EC2 instances were based on Amazon's own CPU](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16640/arm-announces-neoverse-v1-n2-platforms-cpus-cmn700-mesh), not Intel or AMD. I'm willing to bet that Graviton2 grabbed even more marketshare in 2021 and now 2022. Graviton2 offers [34% better price/perf](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/09/better-price-performance-aws-lambda-functions-aws-graviton2-processor/) ratio than x86 chips. Amazon's own claim but it's credible.\n\nMicrosoft and Google have also started designing their own custom server CPUs. It makes a lot of sense. Intel and AMD mark up their server CPUs by 10-20x the cost to manufacture them. In the past, Intel was a monopoly and Amazon, Microsoft, and Google had no choice but to pay high prices for Xeon. If AMD wins, then AMD will just replace Intel as the monopoly. Big cloud providers want to control their own destiny and not have either Intel or AMD grab them by the balls. And they want to lower cost and differentiate based on performance. They also have enough money and scale to design and manufacture their own chips.\n\nThis will have profound impact on big cloud and semiconductor companies:\n\n* Whoever makes the best custom ARM CPU will likely win the cloud war\n* Right now, AWS is in the lead for custom server CPUs because they started first and is already successful with their second chip\n* Smaller cloud companies will get smaller because they don't have the scale to design and make their own custom server chips. Rich will get richer.\n* x86 dominant days in the server are numbered\n* Many analysts are pricing in AMD's expected increase in server marketshares. But what they don't really understand is that big cloud providers are hellbent on avoiding another x86-monopoly. Custom ARM server chips are disrupting AMD before AMD can finish disrupting Intel.\n* Intel, wisely, understands this. That's a primary reason they opened up their fabs to third parties. Intel wants to still manufacture Amazon, Google, Microsoft's chips. Yes, the margins are lower than selling them 10-20x marked-up chips, but at least Intel will still be in the game.\n* TSMC will be another winner from this because these companies will bid for wafers\n* AMD and Intel are the losers. But I expect AMD to lose more and Intel to lose less.\n\nDisclosure: I own Apple stocks, a small amount of Amazons stocks, a very small amount of Intel stocks. I'm waiting to see how Intel's manufacturing will progress before buying more or selling what I have. I'm also waiting to see how Microsoft and Google's custom CPUs perform before going all in on one of the big cloud companies.\n\nPS. Keep in mind that Wallstreet is very late to react to how chips perform. For example, it was abundantly clear that AMD's Zen2 was going to beat Intel's ass in the servers from the moment AMD announced it during CES 2019 (Jan 8 2019). Anyone with any chip knowledge knew Intel's Xeon was doomed back in 2019. But Wallstreet didn't fully react until 1+ year later. Also, it's abundantly clear that Intel's newest Alder Lake chip is going to beat AMD's ass in the consumer laptop and desktop market. But Wallstreet hasn't reacted at all. This means you can wait for benchmarks on Amazon, Microsoft, Google's custom CPUs and still have time to buy before Wallstreet catches on.", "id": "ss5w5r", "created_utc": 1644827934.0, "score": 106, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 68, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 29, "replies": [{"body": "Does ARM face any real risk of future displacement by RISC-V?", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.009786469861865044}, {"body": ">Of course your post is specifically about large cloud providers\n\nMy whole point.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>but x86 days in data centres definitely aren't numbered for now\n\nI wrote \"dominant days\".

This can obviously change in a few years with some open vendor agnostic software stack, but right now there is no ARM-like ecosystem available for high performance GPUs. I think it's more likely for cloud providers to go with ASICs or TPUs like Google, but they are usually limited in terms of parameters, so while AI algorithms designs are quickly advancing, adaptability of GPUs is very useful. This might might as well change in a few years. I think this will keep the cloud companies from investing into their own GPU software stacks, they would much rather skip it and go straight into custom hardware for the workload they have.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Yes, Intel is trying to change that with OneAPI.\n\nThe thing is, not even Nvidia will tell you that CUDA will be the only dominant GPU software framework.

If a stock you originally bought for 100 dollars drops 10%, you can mitigate the damage by buying another of it at the new price if you can just wait for it to rebound. ( as the average price of the two stocks would become 95 dollars, as opposed to 100 and 90 dollars respectively). Do it enough, and you will have shifted from the position of having bought all your stocks high, to having bought (most) of them low. You should try to buy when others are selling in panic, and sell when confidence appear at the highest (or simply keep them for the long run, that is usually for the best).\n\nOr if you want more short term gains, look into gold or current world issues that need to be solved. Oil is one suggestion with the current energy crisis. A supposed war in Ukraine (personally I don't think it will actually happen, and that this is just political posturing for both sides. A pandemic, energy shortage, inflation, and possibly a lack of food if we don't act carefully you say? Cool, now feels like a good time to start WW3) will likely just increase demand for it. Just make sure to read the news daily as these stocks will likely drop quickly as soon as there is an end in sight to the energy crisis.\n\nSomeone mentioned how the rich get richer, and that is somehow a guarantee that markets will keep going up. I would argue that it is the opposite. The rich gets richer because they have more liquidity and financial maneuverability, affording them to keep buying whenever stuff gets cheap and able to weather these storms. Right now the price of oil is rising, while tech is falling. If you are looking in the short term, buying oil related stocks is likely the best move. If you have the financial capability to buy and just hold on to them for the next 3 years at least, I think buying the big tech stocks that are currently glowing red to be the best move as they are basically being sold on discount now - just do try to buy them periodically while under this bumpy ride.\n\nEdit: Also, one small tip if you want to guard yourself in the future, and a good example of what I mentioned in the first paragraph. When in a bullish market, try to invest in some gold while it is cheap. If you had, you would likely have been able to compensate for your other losses and maybe even have ended up ahead. You might of course still buy some gold now and earn a profit, but if you do it now you end up in that awkward position that you will earn some if the market continues to be bearish, but will likely see a small loss as soon as the market returns to normal again unless you manage to sell it again at just the right time.
