{"title": "The opening of tomorrow and Russia\u2019s invasion plan.", "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI have decent experience in trading crypto, mostly made my money with it last year, and  want to switch to stocks and commodities since that whole boom is behind us. I keep myself busy with macro economics and the state of the economy for fun. This is what led me to invest in crypto early, seeing the rise of inflation and run up of the conjuncture cycle. \n\nLast year we have seen the absolute peak of a high conjuncture that was fueled by central banks calling the current inflation transitory. But with the start of this year (and a bit earlier) we have seen the reversal of the conjuncture. This means more dissatisfaction and less jobs, riots and more expensive products. The latter being an indicator of reaching a peak in the conjuncture cycle.\n\nWith the invasion plans being scheduled on coming Wednesday, I expect tomorrow to become a bloody red day. I had my hopes of avoiding the conflict because of the riot\u2019s in russia\u2019s border country Kazakstan. But i\u2019m pretty sure that the pride of Vladimir is so big that he won\u2019t back down of Ukraine. \n\nThis is the reason I am going to hedge my crypto with some investments in oil and gas this afternoon, as I see a rise in oil prices being more likely than tech and crypto doing good. With this I am also considering option trading with a small amount of money which I can afford to lose. \n\nHow are you guys going to handle upcoming weeks? And since I am not super experienced like most of the people on this sub, I am open for your opinions and advice. :)", "id": "srduf2", "created_utc": 1644740244.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.4, "num_comments": 76, "comments": [{"body": "A reminder to everyone, please focus on how this is going to affect a specific stock or the stock market in general.\n\nIf your comment is pushing political agendas, memes, insults, trolling, etc then your comment is going to get removed and/or get you banned.\n\nIf you *have* to discuss just the politics, then post this topic to r/PoliticalDiscussion without linking back to r/stocks, thanks!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
