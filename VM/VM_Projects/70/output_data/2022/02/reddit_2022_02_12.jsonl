{"title": "Does anyone else feel like we are about to experience a catastrophic change in finance?", "selftext": "I recognize that my perspective is heavily influenced by the information and content that I expose myself to. I\u2019m a novice to finance and stocks and I know I am in fact naive. I began investing and trading in late 2020, so up until now I\u2019ve experienced relentless optimism in the market, and in my portfolio. \n\nI know at this point we are all well aware of the 40 year high inflation and the gigantic bubble that is the US (and perhaps global) economy. We are all coming to terms with the fact that the face melting bull run of the last two years is coming to an end, and likely sooner than later. \n\nNow setting that aside, is anyone else getting the sense that finance as we know it, might be coming to an end? Monetary policy for the past 14 years following 2008 (plus a lot of other things) seems to have brought us right to the brink of economic collapse. The Fed is no longer being proactive about mitigating inflation, but instead trying to react to it. \n\nI think concern over the fact that the Fed seems to have totally lost control is warranted. To be candid, I personally don\u2019t think this situation we\u2019re in was an \u201coops\u201d and it\u2019s hard to imagine that this is all not by design in some way. \n\nI\u2019m not at all a sucker for the narrative being created by the financial news shows, and for the most part I do not tune into them at all. I understand their spin weighs heavy on the underlying emotions in the stock market. That being said, this is the first time in my investing journey that the information I\u2019m consuming is overwhelmingly bearish. Not just bearish though, but quite frankly *alarmist*. \n\nThe economic situation we are in currently is probably something to be alarmed over, in my opinion. I think at best we will experience a proper market crash followed by a recession, triggered by the conclusion of QE and rising interest rates, which when combined with all of the other economic struggles the US is facing, won\u2019t look pretty. At worst, we could be launched into economic turmoil so unprecedented, that we will never return to business as usual - and what I mean by that, I don\u2019t really know. \n\nI don\u2019t have a plan for what\u2019s to come. I have no hedges against a falling market. I honestly have no clue what I\u2019m talking about or what\u2019s going to come next. This is essentially just an assortment of my thoughts and feelings assembled into a rambling monologue.\n\nPlease don\u2019t take anything I\u2019ve said too seriously. I just thought I\u2019d share my thoughts here and see what others have to say. Have I just gotten sucked into the emotional market narrative?

That is the whole separate conversation but I think that the stock market is going to have to take one on the chin for the health of the greater economy.

My understanding of how QE and low interest rates have had an impact on inflation is - too many dollars and to few goods. As soon as monetary policy shifts away from printing money and pumping money directly into the stock market, the balance of supply and demand will change with it. \n\nI still can\u2019t argue that now isn\u2019t as good of a time as ever to invest in the market, with all of the free money still being injected right into asset prices. I think there\u2019s a bubble that is perhaps twice the size of 2008, and it will pop eventually, better sooner than later. Whatever economic hardships that the American people will face as a result of this dynamic between the US economy and Fed monetary policy, will be worse the longer the inflation can is kicked down the road, so to speak. \n\nThe generational trend over the past 40 years is putting the younger generations in more and more of a tight spot financially, and I imagine if that trend continues, people will literally take to the streets to demand change.

The real panic was caused when all these funds, and banks, discovered their fucking CASH alternatives were worthless. \n\nI agree that it's getting harder for young people and it's a huge problem. The dems play lip service, but neither side is willing to legislate things that will restore class mobility. The only way you get there is raising tax revenues, decreasing military spending, universal Healthcare and funding for education that reduces or eliminates the need for student loans.  I would have started a business, if I didn't have to worry about Healthcare, and most people wish they could start with nothing, instead of 40k in student loans. \n\nThe lack of economic freedom in this country is destroying America, and handing it all over to corporate interest.
