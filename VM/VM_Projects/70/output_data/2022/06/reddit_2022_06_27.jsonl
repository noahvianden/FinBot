We still have small room to move up until  at least the gap fills so im not rushing this.\n\nDo note that VIX is abormally high PM, and more often than note, this give us a red day.\n\nWill hedge my postion with shorter dated 1 week calls QQQ.\n\nThe  reason for the hedge is that i dont expect the market to run past this  week. If it does i will be closing my Puts postion anyway as by that  point if we are still running we ahve broken out of the falling wedge  and above data was likely good.\n\nIf  you liked this anaylsis check out my profile and throw me a follow.\n\nCheers and good luck to all!", "id": "vls60s", "created_utc": 1656324872.0, "score": 138, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 78, "comments": [{"body": "I will give you my research, I bought PUTS so its gonna rally.

The reality is that there a multiple traders looking at multiple support/resistance lines, trendlines, fib extensions, etc etc all the time.  So, it's not a case of one line working only if *everyone* looks at the same line.  It's more a case of there being several lines or dates or magic moon numbers, each of which might present different probabilities of support or resistance.\n\nThe more common patterns actually do have quite rational explanations behind why they are shaped the way they are, so it's not always about arbitrary lines becoming self-fulfilling prophecies.  It's too lengthy to go into here in great detail, but a lot of the price action you see on any given chart results from institutional traders accumulating or distributing stocks with certain price targets in mind, or it results from indecision in the market as traders are unsure what a stock is about to do next.\n\nOne simple example is resistance lines.  In some cases, they represent price limits that institutional traders have been instructed to go no higher than in their accumulation.  So, you'll see price climbing with increasing volume, and then stop dead on the line, volume then dropping through the floor.  The sellers that have been supplying liquidity keep their orders open, so the price drops down again now that buying (demand) has reduced.  Insto trader tentatively starts hitting the book with bids again, ramping up as more sellers join the party, pushing the price back up to that line again and the cycle repeats.  Sometimes, other traders spot this and join the buying to ride the momentum, and the sellers might also decide to hold off or even become buyers.  This gradually results in the price falling a little less than last time in between those buying cycles, causing an upward sloping trendline to form tending towards the horizontal resistance.  Eventually, more traders cotton on to this accumulation and pile in, pushing the price up through resistance with substantial volume.  The pattern that this very rational market behaviour has formed here is a common *Ascending Triangle* that broke to the upside, as they often do.\n\nCC u/aManPerson, u/DarkStarOptions.", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.37554943561553955}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6088335514068604}, {"body": "I would say.

Zen is the codename for a family of computer processor microarchitectures from AMD, first launched in 2017 with the 1st gen of its Ryzen CPUs. It is used in Ryzen (desktop & mobile), Ryzen Threadripper (workstation/high end desktop), & Epyc (server)\n\nRYZEN, a combination of 'horizon' & their codename 'zen' & EPYC, connoting a 'new epoch' or 'era' in server computing, & change of 'epic' scale\n\nAMD Ryzen microchips are used in Tesla cars replacing the Intel Atom chips\n\nTesla started installing an upgraded accelerated processing unit (APU) in the newly-built Tesla Model 3 & Model Y cars \u2014 the AMD RDNA 2-based Ryzen APU. Before this upgrade, the Tesla Model 3 & Model Y had the basic low-level Intel Atom graphics processing unit (GPU)\n\nTesla has shown that it is aware of the importance of computing power inside its vehicles going forward, & much like the rest of the personal computing industry, it\u2019s going to regularly update its computers with more performance. that\u2019s both for driver-assist/self-driving systems & for the media center & that is a scientific fact\n\nAMD is designed into data centers by some of the world\u2019s largest hyperscalers. Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, IBM Cloud, Oracle Cloud, Tencent Cloud\n\nMS analyst reinstated\u00a0AMD\u00a0overweight $103\u00a0price target, I think $180 is to be fair ... I see a more\u00a0attractive valuation following the recent pullback in AMD which can rise 120%.\n\nFor those not in the know, the Ryzen (formerly Atom) is responsible for handling infotainment duties on Tesla EVs. It\u2019s directly responsible for the screen's responsiveness when activating menus, playing games, loading apps like YouTube or Netflix, & swiping around the navigational map & the new AMD Ryzen chip absolutely smokes the old Intel Atom chip\n\nTesla originally used Nvidia SoC's in its older vehicles, but switched 3 years ago to Intel' Atom CPUs for the infotainment centers in Model 3 & newer versions of the Model X & Model S. Tesla now switched the Model S & X to AMD chips, & completing the transition with the Model Y. Tesla's new AMD graphics chipset has PS5 Performance\n\nTesla has shown that it is aware of the importance of computing power inside its vehicles going forward, and much like the rest of the personal computing industry, it\u2019s going to regularly update its computers with more performance, that\u2019s both for driver-assist/self-driving systems and for the media center\n\nI am citing\u00a0strength in AMD's partnership with Tesla & its server business warrants a higher multiple due to a wide moat & growth trajectory, the valuation is really compelling. NVDA has been the winner up to this point, now it's AMD's time to shine, as it's notably cheaper than NVDA based on multiple valuation metrics\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[charts primed to go nuts](https://preview.redd.it/asv2hd7my5891.png?width=3492&format=png&auto=webp&s=842310a0e02e992e62f50eab1081c1944c485742)\n\nAMD next ER 07-26. daily chart 100% + upside", "id": "vluykn", "created_utc": 1656334812.0, "score": 159, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 71, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|11|**First Seen In WSB**|7 months ago\n**Total Comments**|2|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qxzidv/g_spot_ocgn_back_in_play_canada_day/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qxzvdl/g_spot_ocgn_back_in_play_canada_day_mkt_cap_15b/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qz6tnl/g_spot_ocgn_back_in_play_canada_day/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qznkdk/g_spot_ocugen_back_in_play_canada_day/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uws6tt/gap_up_ocgn_falls_despite_positive_fda_update/) \n**Account Age**|8 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=vluykn)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=vluykn)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.22370903193950653}, {"body": "great job by AMD ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4887)", "score": 27, "replies": [], "tickers": ["amd"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "EPYC sure, Ryzen in general is still a winner but Intel came back hard.
