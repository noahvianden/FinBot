Nothing you said is incorrect about semis in general, but the semis market is absolutely not even remotely close to a down cycle. Demand is off the charts. Profit margins contracted slightly because inflation works bottom-up, e.g. component prices increase first and price increases roll up the chain over time. But, while margins reduced slightly, revenue gained massively. Net profits off the charts across the board, and that's even with bottlenecks delaying orders like crazy. As those bottlenecks ease, component pricing will decrease, and production will increase. Your assessment that we're entering a down cycle is utter nonsense. I'd even go so far as to say that semis are becoming recession proof because people cut back on basically everything except tech. Tech just keeps growing.
