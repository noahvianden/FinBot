{"title": "The uranium story just got more bullish (US Seeks $4.3 Billion for Uranium to Wean Off Russia Supply)", "selftext": "Over the past two years I have been writing several posts regarding the uranium sector and the asymmetrical opportunity that presents itself within this asset class. There has been a lot of volatility over that period of time, but one thing that hasn\u2019t changed is how rock solid the investment thesis behind the uranium sector is. If anything, it has only gotten more bullish over the course of the past year. There are various reasons for this, but the three most prominent ones are:\n\n\u00b7 The Sprott physical uranium trust entered into the market to purchase millions upon millions of pounds of uranium, with them now holding a massive 55 million pounds of the yellow metal and having a net asset value of just around $3 billion dollars at the time of writing. They have played a significant part in the unwinding of the carry trade and thinning out of the physical market and with over $100 million of cash in the coffers right now, there is plenty more stacking that can be done by them and others such as various financial entities, companies and the ANU fund to name a few. As daily liquidity picks up and more investors get positioned into this vehicle, it will allow for bigger capital to come in. Sprott asset management CEO John Ciampaglia, whom I have spoken to on several occasions, has confirmed that some very large funds are waiting for the $50 million of daily liquidity before being able to position. There is a lot of capital on the sidelines and once it is able to come in, the impact is poised to be profound for the sector.\n\n\u00b7 Utilities have come back into the term market to secure long term contracts, some of those including dates that range all the way into the 2030\u2019s and with increasing volumes as well. This is a great sign, as the majority of activity and price discovery happens in the term market as opposed to the spot market. We can expect this to continue as the year progresses, especially now that the rest of the fuel cycle is moving up strongly in the light of the current conflict in Ukraine. To put this into some context, every previous uranium price cycle has always preceded a strong rise in the price of UF6 and SWU (which are further up the fuel cycle), so it\u2019s very much a matter of if and not when this translates into the price of physical uranium. On top of new term contracts, there will also likely be plenty of inventory replenishment as utilities secure supply for the years ahead.\n\n\u00b7 There is a renaissance happening in the nuclear power sector right now. An industry that many believed to be in critical decline over the past decade, is actually on the rise and countries around the world are once again looking to nuclear power in the current energy and climate crisis. France and the UK are committing to their nuclear fleet, China plans to build 150 new reactors over the next 15 years, South-Korea aims to focus on nuclear power again with its news president, Belgium is delaying the phase-out of part of its fleet, the US has recently saved the Byron and Dresden plants and is making funds available to keep more in operation the coming years. There are several more examples, but one thing is clear and that is that uranium demand is on a strong growth trajectory, all while supply is nowhere near sufficient to meet this growing demand. What will fix this gap? A much higher uranium price, with an equilibrium price level likely being around $70-80 right now due to inflation and supply chain issues, as opposed to the $55-60 it was before. That means we have a long way to go before we see those prices being met and uranium being a commodity in a bull market, an overshoot will more than likely happen.\n\nNow that the bullish uranium picture is hopefully clear, let\u2019s briefly discuss the second part of the title of this post. The US seeks $4.3 billion for enriched uranium to wean off Russia supply. This is by all accounts a massive statement of intent from the US and one that caused a spike in equities across the board on Tuesday. The plan is to buy this directly from domestic producers and energy department officials have met with key congressional staff, where they said such funding is urgently needed according to the report by Bloomberg. While there are most definitely more details that will need to be cleared up and nothing is ever a certainty when it comes to new legislation, one thing is clear and that is that there is definitely a focus on security of supply for uranium. For some context, that $4.3 billion represents over 10% of the total publicly traded market cap of the entire uranium sector. While for some it may seem like a small number, it is massive for the uranium space and it has made an already very strong investment case even stronger.\n\nAll in all it is clear to me that the price of uranium, and as an extension the underlying equities, are poised to go on a strong run over the course of the next 12-18 months and potentially as soon as the second half of this year depending on prevailing circumstances. To respect the rules of this subreddit, I won't be talking about any individual equities. The sector is very volatile and I am aware that it is not for everyone, but in my opinion uranium presents one of the best opportunities in the market right now. I hope that this post has painted a clear picture, but as always please make sure to do your own due diligence and if you have any questions, feel free to send me a message.

Will admit I forgot about Tesla for a while. Then a few years later, a bit into the Model S hitting my country, a friend got me interested again. The price didn't quite feel so unobtainable and I was way more comfortable driving. By this stage I had transferred to more general IT but still I had a big interest in green energy and energy management systems. Tesla fit into my interests so perfectly. Still amazed no one then was taking Tesla seriously back then.\n\nWhen Elon announced he had asbergers syndrome I was like, um Duh. It takes one to know one. I am aware this isn't the first controversy, painfully aware. It just feels like they have been ramping up lately, especially things Elon is saying and doing. They also feel a little bit different to what usually happens, something has changed. Usually I can see logic in it but this time I'm struggling. \n\nIt also doesn't feel like Tesla have been following their core goal much lately. The solar roof has had issues with installation. I want to see Tesla in the more commercial side of things. Last mile delivery ideally but I'd settle for getting the semi off the ground. It's been 5 years after all. I get delays and taking your time but 5 years? It's one thing to get cars in people's hands but a car spends most of its time not being driven unlike work vehicles. \n\nDon't get me wrong. I understand the entire market is growing, I get that even if they lose market share they will still be bigger due to the growing market. I'm just worried because the bigger they get, the more push they get. Worried they will fall and fall hard. Elon needs to get his shit together.
