{"title": "WHAT HAPPENS TO GOLD?", "selftext": "Shelter value? crap value?\n\nAt this moment it should be flying, inflation skyrocketing, possible economic recession and all kinds of problems in the economy.\n\nIt's a question I've been asking myself for years. And what is much more relevant, that they become some of the most important investors of our time. Among the gold addicts are some of the most renowned managers (including John Paulson, Marc Faber or Jim Rogers). Among the orosceptics, we have a more heterogeneous group that includes the well-known Warren Buffet as the figurehead. The two sides maintain very marked positions, and with few exceptions (as is the case of Soros, who has come to have a more cautious view) they are not willing to change their position, no matter how much the price of gold does one thing or another.  \n\nGold addicts do not dispute the use of gold as a means of accumulating wealth. It has been that way for the last seven thousand years, they say. They say that gold is the real asset that allows you to store more value in less space. They allude to the fact that the history of humanity has had phases in which gold and money were the same thing, periods in which gold supported the value of money and that since the breakup of the gold standard in the early seventies, gold is a very effective way to protect wealth.
