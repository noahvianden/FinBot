{"title": "Reddit will be one of the BEST IPO\u2019s you will ever buy.", "selftext": "**THE FUTURE OF REDDIT**\n\nLook at you. You\u2019re a male and probably single. You use [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) for your social interactions because you don\u2019t go anywhere on the weekends and wait for market open to gamble your life savings away since you have no wife or even kids to care for. \n\nSo now enter Reddit in 2022. How is Reddit going to compete with the metaverse and keep your cucked eyeballs on here instead of VR? Now while we all may think the metaverse and VR is stupid, it\u2019s where our worlds heading. \n\nSo how does Reddit fit in to the [metaverse?](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2022/06/07/virtual-reality-check-when-will-the-metaverse-vision-become-a-reality/amp/) Imagine Reddit right now. You open it, and see a series of threads or questions on a server. You read and reply. \n\nNow imagine being in a VR Reddit open world. There will be a central lobby where everyone starts out. Ever play COD WW2? Similar to that type of [lobby](https://youtu.be/JrU-aT5TNBM) where everyone chills until they go into a certain game. You essentially choose a \u201csub\u201d to go into and you can talk to people in real time about the thread. So let\u2019s say someone starts a conversation on wsb about how $KO is a buy, you\u2019d basically be in a huge room with everyone else in the thread talking about it in real time. Reddit will eventually serve as the ultimate social server in the metaverse. The Redditverse! You\u2019ll also be able to watch past threads and talk to them in \u201creal time\u201d because it\u2019s all VR. \n\nThe sad reality of this is if you think escapism is bad now? Oh boy, wait until everyone just meets people on the Redditverse and they never have any friends in real life. Wait until your wife finds her boyfriend in the Redditverse and he\u2019s jacked online but some balding 40 year old virgin cuck in real life.\n\n**THE MARKET**\n\nMy guess is Reddit will IPO sometime this year. It may go down like $HOOD at first. This will be the best time to yolo. Now, my guess is Reddit will be bought out by Meta. Now most people will be confused by this, but Facebook knows it will be making the Redditverse. More people like Reddit than Facebook, so it\u2019s perfect. \n\nReddit to the moon.", "id": "v7afob", "created_utc": 1654642898.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.49, "num_comments": 75, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|8|**First Seen In WSB**|1 month ago\n**Total Comments**|1049|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 month|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=v7afob)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=v7afob)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "My head hurts....no brain cells to rub together", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.08335921168327332}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.32716652750968933}, {"body": "This might have been the dumbest thing I've read on this sub in a week.
