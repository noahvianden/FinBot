{"title": "A comprehensiv Analysis into Solo Brands ($DTC) and why it might be a good Investment.", "selftext": "# Hi there,\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v1exiqyjxz391.png?width=311&format=png&auto=webp&s=a99001ee9ce1859a82d2d7fbd6430667a2b5b383\n\n# First of all,\n\nThis analysis may be a bit longer, but it might be a worthwhile read no matter, if are looking for new Stocks to invest or not. I will go through diffrent metrics, that affect the supply and demand side of any given Stock and therefore help us evaluate the fair share price.\n\nInvesting your own money should always be taken very seriously, therefore I won\\`t just write \u201eLFG to the Moon!\u201c, pls don't invest your money solely on MEME\\`s and do your own research.\n\nIn the current Market condition some Companies are severely undervalued, but as always in history they will bend towards their \u201efair\u201c Valuation over time. Our target as Investors is to find those Companies that are not yet appropriately valued by the markets and/or have simply been overlooked.\n\nIn my estimation $DTC is such a Company, which flew under the radar for too long, while having high revenue growth year-over-year and a profitable business model and some more positive factors.\n\nI will try to make the nitty-gritty stuff as easy to understand as possible, while not being too simplistic. For a an nice overview of current fundamentals take a look at: [https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/consumer-durables/nyse-dtc/solo-brands](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/consumer-durables/nyse-dtc/solo-brands)\n\n# The Business model\n\nTo determine the demand side we have to take a thorough look at Solo Brands ($DTC) business model. They are acquiring new brands with name recognition, that have a dedicated following in the Consumer base. They are owner of brands like Solo Stove and Cubbies, therefor fill a lucrative niche in the market. Their sales consist partly from retail vendors (\u2248 15%), but are especially driven through online Markets (\u224885%), which offers easier growth opportunity and greater profit margins. Expansion into international Markets began in Oct. 2021 and will be one of the largest contributing growth factors in the coming years.\n\nDTC\\`s stock market performance is not what I would call stellar so far and has dropped into dirt cheap territory. Allthough $DTC beat the last two Quarter earnings, share price has fallen by over 75% over 6 month. This could offer a great opportunity for investors to enter, but in order to determine this we have to assess the \"fair\" value of $DTC.\u00a0\n\nFurther Info:[https://sgbonline.com/solo-brands-showcases-direct-to-consumer-differential/](https://sgbonline.com/solo-brands-showcases-direct-to-consumer-differential/)\n\n# Determine Fair Value\n\nWe can determine the fair Valuation of DTC by comparing it to similar Companies in the Leisure/Outdoor Industry. if we compare metrics like Price-to-Earnings, Price-to-Sales and Price-To-Book of the broader Industry, a clear picture emerges.\n\nA good example to see how undervalued $DTC is, is the P/B ratio. The current Book Value of $DTC is 571M, while Market Cap. is only 493M, this means a P/B of 0.8x, the Leisure/Outdoor Industry Avr. is 2.6x, which means $DTC is trading more then three times cheaper in this regards.\n\nAn exact valuation is highly complex and would take several pages to lay out, but $DTC outperforms the U.S Leisure Industry in every metric based of EoY expectation. The analyst consensus lies at 13.33$ per share. My own evaluation, in context of the current market condition lies around 11$ a share and I tried to be a little more conservative.\u00a0\n\n# Outstanding Shares, Free Float and Supply\n\nDTC issued 63.4M shares at IPO and did not dilute their shareholder since then. Shares hold by Insiders and long term institutions belong the the pool of Outstanding Shares (O/S). Shares hold by the Public, Short Hedgefunds (SHF) and mid-term holding Institutions belong to the free float.\n\nThe smaller the free float of shares, the better. A small free float means a lower supply of tradable shares.\n\n# Institutions & Insider\n\n**This is were things get really interesting.**\u00a0According to mandatory ownership filings, 13F/13G,\u00a0**Institutions own 74,90M out of 64.4M shares**. Yeah, Institutional ownership according to filings is at\u00a0**118%.** \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Fintel lists institutional ownership at 136.09&#37;, but a closer look into the official filings revealed 118.15&#37; to be correct. See for yourself https:\\/\\/fintel.io\\/so\\/us\\/dtc](https://preview.redd.it/g6fd1mkoxz391.png?width=579&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc295ddc5270a4e3a8d29277588189edea42ff59)\n\n# Thats Crazy & Bullish AF\n\nInvestor relations of several entities were baffled. The best explanation they offered alluded to the asynchronous nature of ownership filings. Its possible that some Institution already filed newly bought shares, while Institution that sold $DTC did not yet update their ownership. However in many years of researching Stocks I havnt seen anything like that. It is clear that institutions own nearly the complete float, leaving only an extremly small float on the table for the public and Short Hedgefunds.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d1etiwcrxz391.png?width=954&format=png&auto=webp&s=8163709c69a8f2ef4080dbbdccea048f14406c60\n\n**In general a high Institutional ownership is great, because:**\n\nShares which are owned by institutions are far less frequently traded. (low supply)\n\nInstitutions are less likely sell, especially now, because they bought since IPO at 17$ down to 4$ and will almost never sell for a loss. According to ownership filings the main bulk of shares were bought above 10$.\n\nInstitution like to buy shares under the radar, keeping share price low, until they are saturated. After this accumulation phase they let the stock price to go up, in order to sell for a profit.\n\nOnce the stock is ready to go up, it will be pushed by media entities, Jim Cramer etc.\u00a0**just like that:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https:\\/\\/finance.yahoo.com\\/news\\/dtc-vs-amzn-stock-value-154003155.html Yahoo Finance laying out why $DTC is a better value investment then $AMZN. Interesting?](https://preview.redd.it/rphpuv9yxz391.png?width=946&format=png&auto=webp&s=e8d5358e1ec869e65f62b81a97e72475946d31cb)\n\n**Insider:** \n\nThe CEO and CFO of Solo Brand ($DTC) bought 90k shares for almost $500k during the last 7 trading days. Insider on average outperform the Stock Market and have more information about positive and negative news.\n\n# Short Interest & FTD`s\n\nI know many people on react allergic to those words and they are thrown around far too often, but the recent surge of GME/AMC shows that they should have a legit usage. Just listen to my arguments please before you bash this DD just on those merits.\n\n# What is Short selling?\n\nHedgefunds can sell Shares short, this works by lending out shares from an entitiy to sell them on the free Market.\u00a0\n\nIn order to make a profit, they will have to buy those shares back at a later point.\u00a0\n\nIf the Share price is lower when they buy them back they can pocket the diffrence.\n\nIf the share prices goes up, they have to pay more then initially and make a loss.\n\n**Example:**\n\nShort Hedgefund A borrows 10 shares for 5$ each and sells them at the Market. Total: 50$ - After 3 month the share price went from 5$ to 3$. - SHF can buy 10 shares for 30$ and gives them back to the lender. - Short Hedgefund pockets 20$ diffrence.\n\n**Short interest:**\n\nWith that out of the way lets look at the latest filing. On the 13th of May 3.21m shares were sold short. We can Assume they were bought above current share price, because $DTC was on a downward trend until recently. So right now they have to buy back the shares they borrowed in order to realize their profits. (increased demand)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s7uw80c4yz391.png?width=548&format=png&auto=webp&s=31f5f6479490adf1027c45724ec7b87764d55c7c\n\nAs of the latest official SEC filing 3.21 million shares of $DTC were sold short. $DTC\\`s share price was in free fall since IPO, but recent developments point to a trend reversal, this offers a great entry point as short seller who close their position significantly drive up the share price.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[See how the chart definitely broke through the yellow trend line - This can be seen as very bullish and a great entry point.](https://preview.redd.it/48wgrnh5yz391.png?width=1532&format=png&auto=webp&s=667478337c7dd384854091437f5424148d7416e6)\n\nThe recent trend reversal puts pressure on SHF because their profits are melting. This means that up to 3.21million shares need to be bought in order to close out existing short positions.\n\nOrtex, fintel Bloomberg etc. all have diffrent numbers for DTC\\`s short interest because they messed up the count of institutional ownership. My observations clearly show a very tiny float with great bullish implications. (Very tiny supply.)\n\nOh Wednesday and Thursday a Volume of 81k and 116k respectively changed the share price by 3.4% and 3.7%. This points to an illiquid flow and is another indicator for a small float.\n\nSo if just a 80k-100k move the price by so much, can you imagine how much the price would move by 3.21m shares? Even better, because $DTC has a very low avr. Daily Volume, of \u2248 600k shares, it will take several days for to get out of their obligations. As of now they are trying to double down and delay the inevitable - This tactic was commonly observed at other low liquidity short plays, but always fails at some point.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Solo Stove\u2122 made by Solo Brands.](https://preview.redd.it/v07zo0i7yz391.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9cf784bea914a8af8956da37da879b593845366)\n\nLast but not least we have **485k Failure-to-deliver (FTD\\`s)** on May 13th which is a bullish sign as well.\n\nFTD\\`s are shares that were bought, but not yet delivered by Market Makers. They have to be bought 35 days after the FTD-date. Next FTD data will be released at 15th of June, so we don't know if even more shares have to be recouped by Market Makers.\n\n# Let me Sum it up - The perfect Storm is brewing. (TLDR)\n\n**$DTC** has a **sustainable and scalable business model,** has increased its revenue by 126% in the last year and is Year-over-Year profitable. Independent analysts **expect $70m in earnings 2022** and beat their last two quarterly earnings estimations. We have **institutions buying up the free float** for months while keeping the share price low, in order to accumulate as much as possible. Look at current filings, it indicates, that they are **very few freely tradable shares available**. Leaving almost nothing on the Table for the public and short sellers. (Low Supply)\n\nAt the same time we have short sellers that have to buy back shares in order to profit, therefore hiking the share price and increasing demand. They find themselves at the point of trend reversal and due to low daily volume need **5-6 days to cover** their short positions. At some point those shares have to be bought back in order to realize profits and with sustainable growth year by year it is possible that $DTC saw its All-Time-Low recently.\u00a0\n\nThanks to the low share price and $DTC\\`s profitability, the downside risk is quite managable right now, we have **88.8% positive Call option Volume** and a **nice gamma set** up is crystallizing.\n\nMarket Makers have to get at least **485k FTD\\`s** from the free Market and most importantly, we have a huge army of **capable retail trader**, who know how to take advantage of Market Mechanics, that were used against them for decades. Because of Solo Brands ($DTC) recent run up many retail traders are on notice, the stock got a lot of positive news coverage, which is the best form of free advertisement.\n\nAs this DD is already far too long, nobody will ever reach this sentence, so I won't go into a technical chart-analysis, but I will shortly point out, that a breakup of a negative trend channel offers a great opportunity to enter, as a long lasting trend reversal seems to be likely.\n\n**Full Disclosure:** I am long with 5k shares and some options. Always do your own research before investing and know your risk tolerance.\n\n# Thanks for reading.", "id": "v62p9q", "created_utc": 1654519507.0, "score": 303, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 64, "comments": [{"body": "Easy to read, nicely done \u2705", "score": 22, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2093159556388855}, {"body": "I did some interviews with them.
