What is Cash?\\\\**\n\nFor this we look at three components : 1 to 3 months Treasury bill, Dxy, Apple.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[RRP lower in yield than US 4 week bill. Blue : RRP , Orange : 4wBill](https://preview.redd.it/l8ebfr3cbb591.png?width=1587&format=png&auto=webp&s=2c85c61e0473a7bd07b242eb35c5d07c07f6efc3)\n\nT-Bill : What only just few people on the Wallstreet know is that less than 90D T-Bills, mostly 4 week and 8 week treasuries, can be considered cash equivalents. We discussed this in our last post that T-Bill were trading lower than rrp in yields because the treasury cut issuance and not the case that MMF were buying it. Hence, due to low yields it was kinda creating a perception that someone is buying it. Hence 10yr bonds were trading around 2.7-2.8%. But now, my friends things have gotten serious; the rrp yields have now gone down lower than the short term T-Bills. Meaning the money is parked in reverse repo facility (excess liquidity ) waiting for Hfs to borrow it so that they can buy longer duration treasuries with it. But will they remain, the case remains to be seen for smoother QT. ( They got smoked on a \"Basis Harvesting\" trade in 2020)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDxy : We have already discussed this way before. Sorry guys due to max limit of 20images i cannot post this. But you guys know where I stand. Its in a 20yr Wyckoff accumulation pattern. Meaning it should in theory go to $120, but at what cost. And will it break it. The answer is idk. Technicals say it should, but c'mon guys. $120 would mean idk Great Depression, but then why did dollar go down in tech bubble. Shouldn't it have gone up kinda like today. But the capitulation started when people lost faith in Dxy. And also this time we have the ECB hike meaning the mirror theory of Dxy and Eurusd. So in all its complicated, but lets break it down.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFaith lost in Dxy : Hence Dxy below $100 and also the price of assets capitulates. Eurusd will be up.\n\nFaith maintained in Dxy : Go past $120 and also the price of assets capitulates. Eurusd will go down.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nApple : Guys who are new, please don't say Tesla. It has to prove the test of time to be called as cash equivalent in stocks. We are still gonna go with Apple. But guys i discussed this last to last time that even though guys, you might see an inverse h&S doesn't mean it will go up. You have to look at the bigger picture why is apple stocks volume going down but prices going up since 2008. The answer is simple. It's called index buying. But since the latest data shows index buying has gone down compared to individual stock buying things have gotten complicated. Apple imo could very well go to $128 and then further down. Also, that Q3 earnings imo won't look good. Tim already warned us before, hence Burry is still shorting it. You can see my more detailed analysis of Apple in WS newsletter 5.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Marking our boundaries in stock market indices**\n\nWe all know there are 4 indices on WallStreet that everyone has their eyes on. It's the S&P500 and Nasdaq, the most watched. Next are Dow Jones and Russell 2000. But guys, we should give more importance to the last 2. Maybe they will tell us a good story. As you all know russell gave its peak in October 2022, followed by Nasdaq and then S&P500. And dow jones somewhere b/w nasdaq and S&P500.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo leading indicators are : RTY , NDQ , DJI , SPX. So lets dive in and create boundaries.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[DJI : 1929 vs 2022](https://preview.redd.it/0pcrduupgb591.png?width=1821&format=png&auto=webp&s=decb9e146477a4c321f3343328b86d4d39633eab)\n\n**Dow Jones :** \n\nOmg what is that and how horrible does it look must be the first reaction from you guys. But guys take a chill pill, i will explain it. You see, every billion dollar company has that motto. Expect the bad, but prepare for the worst. Hence I took that advice for my charts. The least % of our fallen indices is Dow Jones around 10-12%. Hence I took that and went as far as history I could find. There I saw in the period 1929-1933, the Dow fell -89% to -90%. This was called as Great Depression period, as you all must know. Cool thing is, depression happens over 90yr+ cycles. One happened in 1839, the next one in 1929, and then we could have seen the start in 2019, but our Fed being Fed, started saving us because then pandemic hit. So if that saving is going away in 2022, we should prepare for it in 2022. And it's coming guys. You can't stop it. It's either here in 2022 or it will come in 2029. Man, those charts look similar. Let me explain how.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- The one on the left is trading at a 5 sigma bubble, whereas the present one is a 4-sigma std deviation bubble. Both are bubble honestly.\n\n\\- The Stoch RSI kinda gave it away. 1 and 2 are your bottoms, which are also called bottoms of \"Expanded flat\" correction pattern. ( There are three types : Regular, Expanded and running flat. The two tops and two bottoms and after that one giant move up and then come crashing down ) On the left and right we can see b/w 4 and 5. There is kinda a double top and breaking of neckline which suggests depression coming in after neckline break.\n\n\\- The RSI divergences and double tops also predicted respective tops of the bull market in monthly candles.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo you kinda want to ignore all of this shit, but you really can't. Look guys, i didn't mean to do this, but it is what it is. Btw don't sell right now. Make a decision in August 2022.\n\nNote : $4200-4300. This shall be your bottom. The price will at least come here if Depression.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[NDX : 2000 vs 2022](https://preview.redd.it/0jyts0cwvb591.png?width=1821&format=png&auto=webp&s=cecbffed54b74469fd5441c61c2879c4d5cfc3f2)\n\n**Nasdaq :** \n\nI didn't really want to scare you guys up there, but I had to. It's my job as an analyst to give you first the worst case scenario. So now lets tone down a bit to mid case scenario. The one I call Forgotten Depression of 1921 or Dotcom bubble of 2000. Let's be honest guys tech is in a bubble. when you are in a bubble you crash -83% that is the rule the Illuminatis of this world have decided. You see it all around you in Voldemort class of assets. ( the one I shall not name here ) It originated from the idea created in the dot com bubble. So let's discuss some key points regarding this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Both of the charts show kind of an S-curve. What happens in this is you have a significant higher growth rate at the beginning, so you pull all the10yr earnings before and then go into a tech recession where only the strong companies scathe out alive. The rest shall be burnt as peacing to the peasant gods. Amazon did it in 2000. Let's see who does it in 2022.\n\n\\- The tech bottom is b/w range of 0.786 and 0.886 in fib retracement. Or you can just go with my favorite 200MMA. You're never gonna go wrong with this. Hence on the right you can see i created two bottoms. I am not sure which one of them is absolute bottom, but one of them surely is.\n\n\\- RSI as you can see, has broken that white line, which is the historical RSI averages of last 14yrs.\n\n\\- Stochastic RSI is in deep water and will swim there for a while.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNote : $3000 or $5000 shall be your tech recession bottom. Also, why am I saying this is in a bubble for sure. Here's something you guys need to do. Open trading view and make a composite function of SPX/USM2, NDX/USM2, DJI/USM2 and RTY/USM2. You will have your answer. (  I can only do 20max picture here. Sorry ) \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Dividing by M2 money supply : NDX\\/USM2 vs SPX\\/USM2](https://preview.redd.it/v8aet9b81c591.png?width=1917&format=png&auto=webp&s=14a578bd4723c6fd8206210dc6b5e2d3330e0c4c)\n\nOmg these manipulators are everywhere. First, they did that crazy thing with curve inversion before russian invaded ukraine. Yes guys, it wasn't April 2022 when the curve inverted. It was a fuckin February alright. I saw it, its on my twitter. Now we can't make M2 composite function. Fuck you Govt. Guys here, i will share it. I made it last yr. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[SPX : 2008 vs 2022](https://preview.redd.it/m5quvvbf6c591.png?width=1821&format=png&auto=webp&s=13c297c59d1d4dcf4e11cd536b82428fc3a0bd25)\n\n**SPX500 :**\n\nSo now, guys, I will tone it down a bit more. But it's honestly the same. Let's call this one the Global Financial Crisis. The equivalent mid case scenario. Most of you guys now will be like, you gotta be joking. This is most of our worst case scenario. No guys, this is not the worst case. This is the equivalent mid case with V-shaped recovery at the bottom, like in 2008. Worst case scenario is your Greater Depression. This one is what our pal Jamie is warning us about the hurricane on the horizon, and the government doesn't even wanna accept this mid-case one. Why do I call it equivalent, you may ask. The answer is beta. SPX is down -22% i guess, and our tech is down -30%. So i guess we roughly assume 20 and 30% our beta is 1.5. So just assuming our beta remains constant throughout the whole crisis, then if tech falls roughly around 80% then our SPX must be hovering around 53-55% which is exactly what our global  financial crisis should be. And guys, it's not like I haven't told you all this before. We are just repeating most of the things from previous posts and most of our famous economists and youtubers are catching up now. Some key points to remember here again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- That white line you see, i.e. 50MMA expect a bounce to upside from here in June, and then July and August will be green. My swing theory is based on this. But what I don't know is, will 50MMA come this month. What i am sure is about monthly green candles on SPX. So yes, indexes are safer for two months, but you might get more returns to upside in stocks, but you need to be sure to pick the right ones and not the ones where an FUD can be originated. Am I clear guys?\n\n\\- The RSI has a history of bounces from the 40-43 region and our stochastic RSI has bottomed almost and will shoot up but not come out of deep water like 2008.\n\n\\- Even the chart pattern is similar if you exclude out the covid anomaly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNote : The bottom here will be 200MMA at least i.e., roughly in the -50% range.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Just looking back at Russell ](https://preview.redd.it/dlt6nl5vdc591.png?width=1827&format=png&auto=webp&s=d013a0f997715e965b0310d17dab84fd895cd348)\n\n**Russell 2000 :**\n\nIt's the leading indicator guys. So what can I do with it. There is nothing do here. Lets just now discuss the similarity we are seeing in Russell to the 2008 crisis.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- First we touched 50MMA, then bounced up and then touched 100MMA and bounced to a new ATH and now we are finally heading towards 200MMA. That's it guys.\n\n\\- The RSI are now heading towards deep water. Wake me up when it does.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNote : The bottom is $1100 or below, roughly -56%.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nConclusion : \n\n\\- This was just a reminder to not forget where we are headed in the long term. -50% is coming in all indices. I will stand by my predictions. Also, a short term rally to the upside is just on the horizon so please build up cash and we are gonna short together starting August-September 2022.\n\n\\- This was all based on historical analysis. The real present analysis is simple guys. I will tweet about it if I get time. Can't do it here because of image limit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Preparing for the worst in bond markets**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[TLT buy date : May 15 - June 15 window](https://preview.redd.it/lslwb1vuhc591.png?width=1585&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd6ff883a37f8e9d933f722d34aef37825bf0cb2)\n\nI'm pretty sure it has been a million times already that i have posted this chart everywhere. Surely by now everyone has got that at least 3.10% 20yr bond TLT making the average price roughly around $113-114. I told you to buy this bond b/w May 15-June 15. We are almost there. But guys, just in case this QT, i.e. Quantitative tightening for $47.5B/m for next 3months starting June 15 ( Yes, it hasn't even started yet. TB matures mid June and MBS at end of June) isn't priced in, then bonds are in trouble. I will take full responsibility for this ( because i told you all markets prices things beforehand), but i will take no responsibility for a volcker shock. I already have said this before \"Volcker shock\" will hammer bonds and equities together because you're jacking interest rates. This also won't be good for Gold.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut the reason why I tell you guys to buy this long term treasury bond is pretty simple.\n\n\\- At some pt in the 95B/m which has never happened in history, will blow up repo or rrp facility. Or something else will break, and hence for that reason at the end of QT we see that long duration trade step up in the market, causing the stocks to sell off more and TLT to go up in prices. In short Long duration trade will swamp the market.\n\n\\- The second reason to buy TLT is growth will slow down in future and deflation will come. For that purpose you buy bonds. It's gonna be even better than buying dividend stocks whose average returns are 4%.\n\n\\- The third reason i tell you to buy bonds is if a financial crisis happens like 2008 or tech bubble of 2000 implosion or even a greater depression of 1929 this will swamp up the longer duration trade. You can see the charts for 10yr bonds to show you that.\n\n\\- The final reason I tell you to buy is to look at Japan in the 80s. We are kinda doing the same thing and Fed longer term goal is to go for yield controls i..e buying bonds again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe reason you shouldn't\n\n\\- Inflation is going to 10% or above and we need a \" Volcker shock \" to bring inflation down. ( Jack up to 8%. I am crazy, i know )\n\n\\- In order to combat high inflation, we keep changing the definition of neutral rates or terminal rates because Fed has to go above neutral. But what is even neutral. It's bonkers. ( 2.5% or 3% ? )\n\n\\- I am wrong and QT isn't priced in. (47.5B/m and 95B/m )\n\n&#x200B;\n\nConclusion : Don't blow up entire money on 3.1-3.2% bonds. Maybe we could get 4% or even 8-10% in \"Volcker shock\". So I guess, save some money for the reasons you shouldn't. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **A dive into metals and commodities**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Metals :** \n\n2008  ( Financial crisis : Already discussed )\n\nThose who are new might not know this, but certainly the old ones do. Buy Gold at financial crisis bottom because gold too falls in financial crisis like 2008. Bonds don't. But after financial crisis to about 2-3 yrs gold outperforms bonds and indices. So buy it after -50% in equities. That's how we will be creating wealth for the future.\n\nAlso, like bonds gold doesn't like rising interest rates. Don't forget it. But this has been discussed before. Lets learn something new today.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Chart : Gold, Orange line : Inflation, Yellow line : SPX](https://preview.redd.it/tauv5vu4ek591.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=d22bdc0a3458f57265691fe0bab717bcc1a54467)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1970's - 1980's ( Stagflation comparison )\n\nAs you can see the first thing from this chart is two orange peak up way back in 1970-1980. I think you guys know what period it was. It was called the \"Stagflation of the 70's\". So how did stagflation happen? Some say it was due to oil shocks like kinda we are being told it is due to Russia's partial oil embargoes. But do you guys know what happened in 1970-71. Our President Nixon took us away from the gold standard. Yes, friends, it was the day when everyone thought the stock market should go down but instead we went up, and finally it led to that first peak of inflation in the same way our money printing of 2020 led to that first rising peak of our current inflation. But you have to know that inflation and stocks only go up to that certain time so that it doesn't impact forward earnings. After that, stocks go down even as inflation ticks up. So what does this chart tell us? It tells us Gold is the best fucking asset out there to own in a stagflation period. Not bonds not stocks. Just gold. So if gold is the best out there then i guess silver is your low cap gold which will absolutely rip in this stagflation doing a 10x in a period of 2022-2030. (Because they all move slowly)\n\nBut there's always a catch. If inflation as we know it has peaked already, then gold and silver are coming crashing down and making a double bottom while stocks go up, making the current bottom of first peak inflation as absolute bottom. And then we decide if a second peak in inflation is coming in or not. If the answer is yes, metals will go up and stocks will go down, but never touching the first absolute bottom. Hence, stocks will become volatile this decade and go up, and so will metals. But bonds man, they are gonna get smoked if inflation isn't under control. Because nominal yields = inflation + growth. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nCurrent 2022 : [https://www.gold.org/goldhub/research/gold-market-commentary-may-2022](https://www.gold.org/goldhub/research/gold-market-commentary-may-2022)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou can read the full detailed high level analysis of Gold commentary in May. I'm just going to provide a summary of that ahead.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMay highlights \n\n\\- Strong bi-directional equity volatility failed to support gold prices as short term momentum waned.\n\n\\- Outflows of global gold ETF's totaled 53t ( US $3.1bn ) in May, losing 1.3% of assets; in contrast, US Mint coin sales rebounded and remain strong y-t-d.\n\nLooking forward\n\n\\- Gold prices seasonally have shifted in recent years, suggesting a historically strong late summer rally may come sooner that normal.\n\n\\- The ten worst quarters of equity performance have been met with positive gold returns in all but one instance. Current Q2 performance would rank in the bottom 20, yet gold is lower.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Commodities :** \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Commodity index](https://preview.redd.it/ct6xj23dqk591.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=11336ab6a39e6c4ec88702a092f46a32716a406a)\n\nThis is your goldman commodity index. Lets dive in the story of this chart.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- In order to confirm that a commodity bull cycle is coming soon, we need a monthly close candle above the 2008 highs like 2003. Otherwise, it's still years to come like 2000. ( The 2000 and 2003 were trying to break the 1990 commodity top)\n\n\\- But what is certain here is it's at the top of the cycle and we are about to fall -20% or -30%+ from here. Meaning shorting the commodity index is a good freakin trade right now, especially considering inventories are building up and china will reopen soon. But oil shall be very complicated. I wouldn't advise shorting Oil right now ( you can gamble at $140 though. It's your choice ) because China's opening could put extra demand side pressure on Oil considering supply, or we can say inventories aren't building up here. Also, this green initiative we keep talking about is actually bullish for both and Oil and green energy prices. Oil gets benefit from supply cuts ( government be like stop carbon go green ) and green energy takes advantage of demand bursts. And then this will jack up the prices so much that countries will go back to coal coz its cheap and then green energy revolution eventually becomes carbon energy revolution. It's all in circles. Btw, I am just throwing darts here. Don't take this personally with me in comments section. Take this to the government.\n\n\\- Notice the stochastic RSI similarities to 2008. Both were in June. meaning that fake exit liq rally is coming and then we crash in october. We will be tricking investors by making commodity prices go down and which in turn will help inflation come down.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Checking Housing Index**\n\nHousing : [https://www.redfin.com/us-housing-market#overview](https://www.redfin.com/us-housing-market#overview)\n\nGuys this time around i won't give you some stupid chart with only three variables involved, i.e. housing prices relative to income. 10Yr or 30yr treasury bonds, or MBS . inventories. But this time you guys will see for yourself what is happening in the housing market. So click on the above link.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Overview :**\n\nJump into this website to see for yourself. Median sale price is up 15.3% yoy, whereas the number of homes sold is -11.7% yoy. Also, the 30yr fixed mortgage rate is 5% but this has changed recently i believe. It's 6.13% as of June 13. You can also see the demand and supply side of things with the conclusion given too. All I would like to say is this data is lagging. It's showing April data, so don't get confused because of this. You need to see the mom data to actually know how fast things have changed from April to June. And if you did you would know housing is next after Voldemort, bonds, stocks.\n\nThis is your S&P shiller index ; [https://www.mortgagenewsdaily.com/data/case-shiller-home-prices](https://www.mortgagenewsdaily.com/data/case-shiller-home-prices)\n\nand this website is cool too, like redfin. But do you wanna know a secret. If you check the NAHB index, you might see a divergence in NAHB and shiller. Kinda cool. Meaning we are about to fall like 2008.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**News :** \n\nAlso, we know mortgage payment/ m is rising whereas rent prices are still flat/m. Expect rent prices to go up as well\n\n [redfin.com/news/redfin-rental-report-may-2022/](https://redfin.com/news/redfin-rental-report-may-2022/)\n\nLuxury home sales have already started sinking. -18%\n\n[https://www.redfin.com/news/luxury-home-sales-april-2022/](https://www.redfin.com/news/luxury-home-sales-april-2022/)\n\nBe aware of this adjustable rate mortgage trap. Don't do it. This could very well shot up if Fed volcker us.\n\n[https://www.redfin.com/news/adjustable-rate-mortgages-vs-fixed-2022/](https://www.redfin.com/news/adjustable-rate-mortgages-vs-fixed-2022/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nConclusion : Patience anon. Don't buy home in 2022. Wait for 2023-24.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Reason :** \n\nInventories : Are Going Up, but Inflation : Is Also Going Up. Kinda contradictory, but this is what is happening all because of oil and money printing.\n\nSo Mortgage : Go up because Fed is on a hike cycle. Also Employment : Go up. Tightening labor markets but also dying liquidity and trouble for companies as they prepare for recession.\n\nHence Home sales : Decline but  Rent prices : Go up, forcing those rent payers to buy homes in 2023-24.\n\nBut if for some reason no one is willing to buy homes (an economic down thrust) at high mortgage rates, then we could see a death spiral. Supply keeps going up like a ponzi coin and demand is almost negligible. So prices will readjust.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[LHS : US employment vs Housing index, RHS : Mortgage applications vs housing index](https://preview.redd.it/ga066i7ufl591.png?width=1912&format=png&auto=webp&s=e44cd09f6c2978e0695521a8a371a4b7f50f8aac)\n\nOh my god, did i miss any of my charts for housing. I was going to, but I found this really cool stuff. In 2008-2012, unemployment rose and I mean tremendously. We are nowhere near it. Nowhere. So my point being, why did the mortgage application go sky high? It couldn't have been middle class or lower coz. How could they. They were busy saving. So who bought these. Maybe \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  So, my friends, when you see the breakout in mortgage applications with unemployment high. huh but this Turkey thing is bothering me. So lets make it only breakout in mortgages. When you see that in the data, you buy a house. No questions asked. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Looking at Geopolitics chart. Yes it exists.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Poland MSCI ETF](https://preview.redd.it/ji6rx90rhl591.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=f946ca2e59be1a973e3508d5088e1b48ce93eb55)\n\nIt's called Poland MSCI ETF. I just plotted it against SPX for fun. I don't know what else to comment down here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Spreads are important ( x/y , x-y, ) Also compare.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[LHS : IEI\\/HYG, RHS : TLT\\/JNK](https://preview.redd.it/4ftp0g6rql591.png?width=1917&format=png&auto=webp&s=161b0cb218ea2eb888fd2198a343be42ccc62285)\n\nOn the LHS we have IEI/HYG graph against US2000 i.e. risk assets whereas on the RHS we have TLT/JNK against SPX. One might ask, what is the difference b/w TLT/JNK and IEI/HYG. A noob guy like me would answer that there is no difference. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn the numerator we have IEI, i.e., an ETF that measures 3-7yr treasury bonds, whereas TLT is an ETF for 20yr treasury bonds.\n\nOn the denominator we have HYG, which measures the price of high yield corporate bonds, whereas JNK means junk bonds. The difference b/w the two of them is HYG has a higher cash holding i.e. 1.1% as compared to JNK 0.15%. Consumer cyclical holdings are similar, but a difference in 18.5% and 16.5% in communications, respectively.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe LHS chart shows the spread is widening and has reached its highest value since the decline it made off its 2020 high (The 2020 stock market lows). A higher IEI/HYG spread means the prices for Treasury bonds are higher than prices for Junk bonds. The current rising spread shows the ongoing flight from riskier corporate backed debt into safer government-backed debt.\u00a0This isn\u2019t too surprising as institutions have been derisking for months due to interest rates and CPI rising, but it further illustrates the poor institutional sentiment for owning risk assets.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe RHS chart shows a similar thing. The only difference is the taste of investors to make predictions on what chart.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo know further more about them, you can read it here. ( Since I am a noob)\n\n[https://seekingalpha.com/article/2684995-you-are-using-hyg-and-jnk-all-wrong-here-is-what-to-do-about-it](https://seekingalpha.com/article/2684995-you-are-using-hyg-and-jnk-all-wrong-here-is-what-to-do-about-it)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet me just give you an example of how to use this technique to our advantage.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[HYG vs SPX](https://preview.redd.it/s4hovr57dm591.png?width=1917&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebba70c28b8424ef4c1e183c84825519f091b4fe)\n\nAs you can see when we see the divergence in this graph b/w S&P500 and HYG, then something needs to correct itself. Look at the 2014-15 period HYG started to make a lower high, but the stock market went up. This means the companies have started planning for some downturn. And then a few months later, you can see the decline started to happen in the stock market. The same was the case in 2018 and now 2021-22.\n\nSo we can use this theory to our advantage when HYG makes a higher low or double bottom but the stock market makes a lower low, then you can witness an upside rally in the stock market. Also, this rate of change indicator can come in very handy. You see, it needs to go down to 2008 levels and then make a higher low. And that, my friends, will be the bottom of the market.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Yield curves ( Just 10-2 yr and 30-5 yr)**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[LHS : 10-2yr, RHS : 30-5yr](https://preview.redd.it/n0dcxmu2kl591.png?width=1828&format=png&auto=webp&s=217437c404030b1c4d046da0cf9c0be317a8e9a7)\n\nJust posting to let you guys know curves have reinverted again, meaning they are making those dangerous log down lines we keep talking about since the start of this year. I know Fed keeps talking about the 10-3month. Well, since I don't trust them, I don't want to look where they want me to look. Instead, I look at the 1yr forward curve called 30-5yr. I dont even know why, but I saw one analyst look at it and give detailed analysis. So Hmmm.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **VIX Call me...!!!**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[LHS : VIX, RHS : Call options](https://preview.redd.it/g8iyy2oqml591.png?width=1917&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7b0f307f0a850278b307caa853c50d062d3fb2d)\n\nSmall traders buying call options have nearly evaporated. As for the VIX, well, unless it goes to 40 or 50, we ain't gonna see the bottom. Also look at the RSI, it's not even ticked up. As for stochastic RSI on monthly, it's at top and will go down in b/w June-September sharply. And then Q4 will be bloody hell upon the market when RSI shoots up to 80+ with stochastic RSI up and hence VIX index up to 40+.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **The Others**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[June is the baddest month in mid term elections \\( another reason for bottom is here \\) , unemployment ticking up. ](https://preview.redd.it/wrre4tkofm591.png?width=1918&format=png&auto=webp&s=afd23b6ec7828397e033a29b1041b36cd47f8a11)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Fed rates impacting BOJ](https://preview.redd.it/c0g9xl4mjm591.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d0ca19381f3469f668441da88736909260e326b)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo as you can see, Fed swap market is pricing in 190bps for the next three meetings and it has then again impacted our terminal rates, which were 3.2% before but are now projecting 3.8%-3.9% by August 2023 and 3.45% by the end of the year. You can check this data for yourselves by contructing a composite function. ZQF2022-ZQZ2022 will give you terminal rates by December and ZQF2022-ZQQ2023 will give you rates by August 2023. So if you go a step further till September 2023 and October 2023, you shall see that the rate projection is actually going down. That means the Fed traders are pricing the rate hike cycle to end by somewhere b/w august 2023 to september 2023. This is what that graph in b/w suggest so. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo this all USA rate hike cycle then in turn is impacting our Dollar. The dollar is going up, so hence the DXY index is going up. Since the dollar has a major percentage in Dxy. This in turn is causing Euro, JPY and other currencies to plummet against the dollar. So the countries that arent hiking rates, for example Japanese Yen or JPY, is getting destroyed and ripped apart by the dollar. Look at the JPYUSD on the right. It's going to the moon.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The final Result :** **TL;DR**\n\nLet's wait for Powell tomorrow and see if we get our expect 75bps but get a 50bps rally or not. If we do then the bottom will be June 14 or 15. \n\nIf we get 75bps then the bottom will be somewhere in the last week of June.\n\nJuly is going to be green and august peak of the bear market rally. Crash starts August-September 2022 once this heavy bulldozer like balance sheet starts getting removed. Then we can have -20% swings in one Mondeathday.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Thank you guys for making it this far.**\n\nWith lots of love.\n\nRegards \n\nUchiha ( First member of Akatsuki )", "id": "vcchtc", "created_utc": 1655237774.0, "score": 71, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 73, "comments": [{"body": "This is going to take me an year to read and 10 years to understand.

Thank you for your efforts with this. I use long HYG puts to hedge my portfolio. Can you elaborate a little more on the relationship between SPY and HYG and what the chart is perdicting?

Very few people actually hedge using HYG. \n\nWell, like i said, HYG is kinda like risk on bonds and IEI your government safe bonds. So when HYG goes up, it indicates investors feel confident and they are willing to take on risk and hence risk on assets in SPX and Nasdaq starts rallying more as compared to safer plays. \n\nThe reason for the HYG rally is simple. A lot of bearish sentiment was already priced in the markets after red-hot cpi and talks of 75bps. So 10yr bonds readjusted itself to FF rates, which were initially 3.2% but now 3.8% - 4 %. So when Powell actually delivered 75bps to fight red hot inflation. It meant kinda like sell the 75bps rumored bps and buy the news of 75bps. Lot of put a/g HYG have must have came off the markets. ( One day before prev march SEP FOMC) So hence we rallied. This in turn led to risk on assets rising in the SPX , Nasdaq and crypto. \n\nNow we shall see if this rally will last or not, and smart money are confident that Powell will fight inflation w/o bringing recession and deliver soft landing.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["cpi", "recession", "inflation"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4454495310783386}, {"body": "Buy BABA", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Ofc.
