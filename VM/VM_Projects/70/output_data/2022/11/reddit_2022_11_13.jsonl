They even de-featured the platform only to throw the features into add-ons (e.g. Sites became Communities), and they buy up decent products only to de-feature them and jack up pricing (e.g. CPQ, Mulesoft). This also happens with ideas on their Ideas forum. Ideas that are obviously fixes to terrible functionality get rolled up into paid products rather than added to GA, even when they are primarily applicable only to the base Sales or Service platform.     \n     \nImo, the best example of a lacking capability is the use of junction objects as a pseudo-replacement for proper many-to-many relationships. Another big one was the lack of dynamic pages with input dependencies. Also, their multi select fields are generally worthless, especially in terms of reporting on them or automating with them. Their price books are a complete shit show, but CPQ can kind of help here if you're willing to shell out for it and fight the nightmare set up and train users thru their awful UI. That of course makes the Product, Opportunity, Quote, and Order objects a pain in the ass. Changing permission and accessibility rules can be horrifically cumbersome. Their botched transition from Classic to Lightning left a ton of features bastardized in the netherworld between. Their email integration with Exchange is almost as terrible as their ridiculous Outlook plugin.

The company has acknowledged this recently though and even mentioned that the buyback they announced a few months back was partly to make up for the dilution from SBC.
