{"title": "Which stocks could be a safe haven if the U.S. falls into a recession?", "selftext": "Recently, whether the United States will fall into a recession has become a topic of discussion among more and more Wall Street investment banks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn the one hand, the U.S. 2-year and 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds have been inverted since July this year, and the yield curve of the U.S. 3-month and 10-year Treasury bonds showed the largest inversion since the end of 2019 yesterday, indicating that the market Fears of a recession are growing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn the other hand, Wall Street and Silicon Valley in the United States have started a wave of large-scale layoffs, and business tycoons such as Musk and Bezos have frequently warned that a recession is imminent.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, if the US recession does come, how should we allocate assets? Perhaps we can look for more valuable answers by referring to the performance of assets during recessions in previous history.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSince 1854, the U.S. has experienced 32 cycles of expansion and contraction, with an average recession of 17 months, according to economists, while several recessions since 1980 have averaged less than 10 months.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFrom 1980 to the present, the United States has mainly experienced the following five economic recession periods: July 1981-November 1982, July 1990-March 1991, March 2001-November 2001, December 2007 \u2013 June 2009 and February-April 2020.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAmong them, the last two recessions are deep recessions (GDP falls by more than 3%), and the first three are mild recessions (GDP falls within 3%).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLooking back at the performance of U.S. stocks and other major assets during these five recessions, it can be seen that:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGold typically performs well as a safe-haven asset during recessions, gaining an average of 6%, while crude oil can fall due to a demand slump, especially during a deep recession - especially in early 2020, due to The new crown epidemic led to a sudden drop in global crude oil demand, and international oil prices even fell to a negative value for a time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt the same time, it is worth noting that a bear market in U.S. stocks does not necessarily occur during an economic recession: for example, in the three mild recessions from 1981 to 2001, the decline in U.S. stocks did not reach the 20% bear market standard line. In fact, of the 25 bear markets that U.S. stocks have experienced since 1928, only 14 have been associated with recessions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2001 Recession: Tech stocks were the biggest losers. Recession of 2008: All sectors of the US stock market are muddy. As can be seen from the two recessions mentioned above, sectors such as pharmaceuticals, consumer goods and utilities tend to be relatively \u201cresilient\u201d during mild recessions, while tech and cyclical sectors tend to be more vulnerable; in deep recessions During this period, almost all stock assets will be sold off, and even relatively \"resilient\" sectors will not escape the doom of being sold off.", "id": "ywuksz", "created_utc": 1668608154.0, "score": 25, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 71, "comments": [{"body": "Utilities --state regulated oligopolies.\n\nOtherwise, buy back in near the bottom.", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "When bottom?", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.22600337862968445}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2854805588722229}, {"body": "I bought more Kroger today", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Overvalued, not safe.", "score": 5, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.18735374510288239}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.11571140587329865}, {"body": "Prisons", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Hmmmm.
