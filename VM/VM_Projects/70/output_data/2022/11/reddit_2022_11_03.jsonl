This argument has been used by bears for years on Apple. \n\n1. Apple has extremely high margins and return on investments. Apple is using their current assets to generate massive returns. Let me give the examples by using all of big tech.\n\nCurrent ROIC:\n\nApple: 50.2% \n\nMicrosoft: 27.6%\n\nGoogle: 25.9%\n\nAmazon: 12.6%\n\nMeta: 27.2%\n\nNetflix: 16.0%\n\nThis is actually the metric Warren Buffet and Charlie Munger talk when asked how much of a premium should you pay for a company. This is also one of the many reasons why Warren Buffet calls Apple \u201cthe best run company in the world\u201d. A 10% ROIC is considered high and means the company is doing good investing its money. This is by no means mean\u2019t that I am trashing Microsoft. I still think they are a great company and a ROIC of roughly 27% is still phenomenal. However Apple has an ROIC of 50%! This absolutely extraordinary and I have yet to find a company with that level of return on investments. This means Apple really knows where to put money and how to get unbelievable returns on that money more so then any tech company. The point being if Apple can use its resources extremely efficiently then why should its assets be compared to other companies? They just simply can\u2019t cause Apple is so efficient at generating massive profits from its assets.\n\n2. Book value is really only used by people that think the company is not doing well. Unless your worried about Apple going bankrupt sometime soon and having its assets get liquidated then it shouldn\u2019t matter. Apple shouldn\u2019t have to sell any of assets anytime soon and I would be extremely surprised if something like this were to happen.\n\n3. Apple is a technology business. The company doesn\u2019t manufacture its own products so its not going to have extremely large assets on its balance sheet. The only thing Apple needs is a building, people, and computers. Apple mostly outsources all its manufacturing to different companies. \n\n4. Price to book doesn\u2019t take into account future growth and just assumes the same assets for years. \n\nIn terms of current ratio its not the only thing you should be looking at when valuing a company and saying which company is better. Current ratio is important but unless you think Apple is going to hit  bad times and have a hard time meeting its financial obligation\u2019s then a current ratio around 0.9 is not the end of the world. \n\nI also think its important to take into account earnings and cash flow when talking about debt. Current ratio is sort of like payout ratio its an ok metric but not an accurate way to truly measure the companies financial health. EBITDA takes into account the cash flow and earnings from company it generates. If you compare Debt/EBITDA it comes out to about 0.7. This means if the world goes through a financial meltdown Apple could pay all of its financial obligations in less then a year. \n\nThat is about as clean of financials you can get.", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "\"apple has extremely high margins\"\n\nthat might have to do with its prices being high compared to competing products.
