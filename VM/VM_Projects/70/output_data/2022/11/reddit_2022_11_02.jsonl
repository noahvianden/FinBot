{"title": "Why do people buy Apple so much?", "selftext": "I'm talking about Apple PRODUCTS\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll apple products are pricey things, including the iPhone, mac, iPad and everything.\n\nYes they are excellent products with absolutely outstanding performances compared to other products out in the market. Still, yet a LOT of people who buy apple products can save a fortune by picking other products other than the standard MacBook or the iPhone. But yet they have so much market monopoly going on all over the world with such products that will normally be considered quite expensive, to the extent this is almost baffling\n\n&#x200B;\n\nApple grew AGAIN in the latest quarter\n(While all the other major companies mostly had an earnings shock) and I personally think this can only be explained by \"People paying for apple products again and again.\" If apple was a growing company aspiring to eat up a lot of the marketplace in the future then the reason for their growth would be pretty obvious. But they're not. It's not like they're starting to insert ads within the ios to increase their revenue. Their one and only source of profit is (mostly) their Apple products. Phones, Laptops, and Tablets that are more than outstanding in quality but also have a significantly higher price tag compared to other products.\n\nIt's making people buy the same iPhone again and more (well, not the same but you can still work longer with your previous iPhone.). I don't think Apple would be able to grow this much if people only bought a single iPhone to replace their previous iPhone every three years when their iPhone finally dies.  For some reason they're making the same people buy so much apple products again although their extremely high price tag. Something like buying another iPhone in a shorter span. Or buying other Apple products as well after purchasing your iPhone. Adding a new Macbook in your shopping cart although your previous one is still good.\n\nSeems like people LOVE the iPhone. Yes it's a cult, it's almost something like a new religion\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey don't really have a lot of new customers out there to purchase their first iPhone. Yet the company is still GROWING. A LOT\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIs it the marketing? Is it because of product quality?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow is the company still GROWING?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nor am i missing something?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(and yes this was written on my iPhone)", "id": "yk6muk", "created_utc": 1667399113.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.42, "num_comments": 77, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|just now\n**Total Comments**|0|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=yk6muk)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=yk6muk)\n    \n>TL;DR: Apple is growing because people are buying a lot of their products again and again, even though they are quite expensive.
