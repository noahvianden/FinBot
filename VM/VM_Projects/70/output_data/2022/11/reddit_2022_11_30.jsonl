Just one tip for you if you are not already aware of it. For future reference when you are shorting - calls or puts. As SOON as the underlying price hits your strike - ie ATM... roll it out. I've been very successful rolling out 2 weeks and collecting a NET credit OR rolling out 3 or 4 weeks and collecting a NET credit AND gaining a strike or two. The deeper ITM you let the strike get the harder it is to do that. Anything below about an 80 delta is \"possible\" but it gets harder so I would keep a close eye on the price and if you get a swing in the right direction close and roll. I got stuck in CPNG recently (still there) the same way. bought at $21 and it decided IMMEDIATELY that $15-ish was a better price. I just picked the closest best strike I could for a reasonable premium. I try for half way between the current price and the cost price but I will take the strike I can get for a decent premium. I too, got my low strike on my first try hit within a few days. At that time I just did a BTC at a loss and cried in my beer. Ha ha. I read a LOT in the next few days so I started over. Upped my strike a bit and as soon as it hit my strike I rolled out for a credit and I just went out far enough to get a strike or a strike $0.50. I did this 2 or 3 times and I am now sitting with CPNG at a close of $19.58 today and short calls on it at $22.50. Almost a $1.50 over my cost. It's not a great chart on CPNG and there is resistance around $20-21 but it's also not a huge part of my account so I figure I can play with this and learn instead of learning on something that could cost me a BUNCH. At some point on some trades you just have to say it's not coming back but CLF is a decent stock and if you play it right you should actually make a fair bit of profit. Just keep your eye on the price and the deltas. I got caught in the \"fell over a cliff\" with VERU just recently too. $15ish to $5ish overnight. Nothing I could do. That hurt but I rolled what short puts I could and took a loss on the ones I couldn't roll. I am now in a position where I've cut my loss at least in half and if I get my next fill I will be under the Current UL price on my holdings and will probably recover it all....
