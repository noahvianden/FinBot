For my self, I see it better to sell 16 delta (1 std) strangles on /ES instead so that you can actually make money along the way to withstand drawdowns in the future. Research I\u2019ve done by utilizing tatsytades loopback website gives you an idea of P/L per trade on something such as this. You want to make it worth your while by actually having enough risk on the table that will theoretically pay you over time with a higher than normal win rate percentage (I.e. > 60%) it\u2019s not worth risking say 7k on one /ES strangle at 3 deltas collecting a premium of $300 or whatever it is and win 99% of time, but lose most of it after the 1% outlier move happens. I\u2019d say it\u2019s best to stay consistent with something far enough OTM to make it worth having the trade on (ie 16 delta, around $2600 strangle based on current IV) where you make enough over a long enough time to withstand the losses you will encounter. I won\u2019t link it here, but I\u2019d recommend that you watch every possible tastytrade video talking about 16 delta strangles, futures options, tail risk, capital allocation rules, SPY vs. ES, notional risk, etc. it takes a while but you\u2019ll get the hang of it.

If you make more money by taking on more risk you obviously will be able to handle drawdowns. At the same time, you will have more drawdowns and bigger losses. Whether I am selling at 5 delta or 16 delta it comes down to the same thing in my mind which is how well you manage your losers. Theoretically it should all be a zero sum game and your risk management skills are what make it profitable. I prefer having strikes further out because it makes risk management easier by giving me more time to adjust, and less occurrences where I have to adjust, etc.\n\nAs I gain more \"practice\" I believe I can manage faster moving and riskier trades down the line.", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6671286821365356}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.19949884712696075}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.08091383427381516}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.008673067204654217}], "tickers": []}
