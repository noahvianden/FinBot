It is worse then that\u2026. In the last 40 years since then the cost of living has been going up at a steady pace yet the minimum wage has not kept up\u2026. Even jobs that pay double the minimum wage can barely keep a family of 4 afloat with only one income earner. So there is a greater disparity between what minimum wage was then to cost of living vs. What the minimum wage is now vs. The cost of living.\n\n2)Secondly, while inflation was extremely high back then so was interest earned on savings. Back then(1980)you could get 15%-20% return on your money in a savings gas account. Mind you a lot of people had to walk away from their houses\u2026 Since the 2008 crash let\u2019s just say that a 5% gain in a year on your retirement would be a great return\u2026 barely above the cost of living\u2026 everyone for the last 12-14th years has made practically nothing when you factor in inflation on their retirement savings\u2026. That\u2019s affecting a lot of retired people today to the point where they have to work after retirement\u2026 just to make ends meet. and will affect a lot more in the coming years.\n\n 3)Rising interest rates are not such a big deal even if it went up to 6% or 7%\u2026 it\u2019s actually great for retirement savings because now people will be able to make a return on their investment over the years\u2026 The problem lies in how high house prices have become since the 2008 crash and the extremely low interest rates for over a decade. Now buying that $1million house will cost $50k-60k interest a year as opposed to $25k/year when mortgage rates were 2.5%. How are people going to sell their houses for a profit when the interest rate on mortgages pretty much tripled in a year\u2026 and still need to go up to at least 5.5%-6%. Wages are not going up. Not everyone is making great money. Expenses are rising at a crazy pace. People are broke\u2026 consumer debt is at all time highs\u2026. Utilities\u2026. Fuel\u2026used vehicles\u2026. This will force more people to keep renting, which will make rental prices go up even higher to their being less of a supply, which in turn makes saving for a down payment that much more difficult\u2026.\n\n4)Daycare\u2026. Namely for a family of four with 2 young children at home. $1000/month per kid if not more spent on daycare\u2026. \n\nLet\u2019s just say that at one time one person could work, one person could stay home and raise the kids.\n\nThen it changed - 1 person needed to work and one person could work part time\n\nThen it became 2 people needed to work and the grandparents or someone else needed to watch the kids after school if you were lucky\u2026\n\nNow we are at the point where the grandparents, adult children and the children need to live together because everything has gotten so damn expensive\u2026. and it\u2019s only getting worse\u2026. Maybe some friends, aunts, uncles\u2026. It just seems like 2 adults can barely scrape by if at all anymore.\n\nBottom line is something is broken in the current system and at some point soon the whole market should take a rather massive hit\u2026.

Considering the minimum wage barely doubled in 20years\u2026. That would put the minimum wage at $50-$60/hrs with a great paying job paying in the neighbourhood of $300/hrs or $48,000/month while the average job might be $120/hr\u2026.
