I think for Dinsey rfight now the weekly realse cadence works because the price is low eough (espcially internatioally) but if the price goes up they are going to need to have a lot more shows going on as at a higher price points staying subcribers for only a couple of hours of content a week becomes less justifiable. Espcially in the US. Disney got great IP that's super popular but not everyone cares about that IP. Netflix right now offers a lot of variety for the diffenret people with differnet tastes with comedy specials, reality shows, more teeny drama, true-crime and other documentaries, serious dramas etc. and releases entire seasons (or volumes) of them almost weekly. With that in mind, Netflix has a lot of content and very diverse content that I don't thinkt hey need to worry about stretching single shows thin to get more engagement.  Netflix has been arguably doing a good job at managing costs, they don't really need to cut costs as much as people think. They've been profitable for almost 20 years contrary to popular belief and their debt is arguably very manageable when compared against how much cash they have on hand and how much profit they make per quarter. \n\n\nI think what Netflix needs to improve more in certain areas like movies, rewatchable TV, and more procedural dramas.
