{"title": "Do you believe the days of big-tech market leadership are behind us?", "selftext": "I was listening to The Compound with Josh Brown earlier and he was asked if he believed tech would lead us out of this bear market. He answered no, explaining that it's never the companies that led the last cycle that lead the next. He then went on to say that the believed defence stocks could be the leadership group and that growth stocks would never be as hot as they were again.\n\nI was quite surprised by his answer honestly, although I've heard a lot people make similar arguments against tech leadership recently.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this? As someone who started investing a decade ago I've never seen anything but tech dominate the market and while I understand trends can change I guess I just find it hard to wrap my head around how tech could become less relevant to either the market or the economy going forward.\n\nSo long as concerns around inflation and the energy crisis continue I could see the case for the energy outperforming, but it seems to me this trend isn't likely to persist and that eventually companies like GOOG, AMZN, AAPL and MSFT will fall back into favour. That said, if you look at how the top 10 companies in the S&P500 have changed over time it probably shouldn't be so surprising if we did see a longer-term shift out of tech. And with FB & NFLX already falling out of favour you could argue this shift away from big tech leadership has already begun.\n\nWhat do you think?

When Tesla gets back to 1000, the bear market will be over/almost over. By that standard, the coil will be unwinding and investors will be looking further out into the future, allowing it a higher P/E ratio. What I\u2019m saying is when Tesla gets back to a thousand (could be in 6 months or 15 months) an exit strategy will not make much sense. The only way that exit strategy makes sense is if tesla is pumped to 1000 within the next month for example, then that would be a good exit strategy as you could consider this a short term bear market reversal. Even so if it gets to 1000 in a short time span, it might even mean the markets have reversed for good.

For purposes of this, let\u2019s say the $105 strike for next Friday has a bid of 2.00 and ask of 2.05. Click on the 105 strike just like you would if you were buying the call. But instead of \u201cbuy to open\u201d, select \u201csell to open\u201d. Put the price somewhere in between 2.00-2.05. \n\nWhat this means is, if the price is $105 or higher on the exp date, you\u2019re shares will get called away at a price of 105 (you made $5 per share) PLUS, you keep the amount you sold the contract for (let\u2019s assume 2.00)\u2026 your total is $700 ($500 for the shares, $200 for the contact you sold). \n\nLet\u2019s assume the price of Amazon is less than $105 on exp date. You keep your shares and the $200 on the contract you sold.\n\nSelling covered calls limits your upside if the price goes sky high (let\u2019s say Amazon goes to $150 by your expiration date, you only get $105 for the shares because that\u2019s the strike you sold the contract for). But it also limits your downside because even if the price goes down, you still make money on the contract sell, which lowers your average cost basis.", "score": 102, "replies": [{"body": "Dude very nice of you to type all that out!", "score": 31, "replies": [{"body": "Just trying to help regards learn another play besides 0dte Spy calls/puts.
