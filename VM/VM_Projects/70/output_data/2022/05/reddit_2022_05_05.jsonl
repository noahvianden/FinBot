{"title": "Putting Cramer on the record: He thinks inflation is peaking", "selftext": "[Cramer is making two major points](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/05/investing-club-were-not-panicking-cramer-sees-inflation-peaking-looks-for-stock-buys.html). Wanted to take everyone's opinion on this.\n\nFirst point is that today's sell off is caused by 10 year yield rising above 3%, which triggered algorithms to start selling stocks.\n\n>Bond investors are likely selling their holdings, Cramer suggested, because they believe Powell was wrong to say the Fed is \u201cnot actively considering\u201d a 75 basis point hike while the economy faces its hottest bout of inflation since the early 1980s. The bond market moves are, in turn, triggering stock sales by algorithmic traders, Cramer said.\n\nI'm not quite sure what Cramer is saying here. Is he saying that bond holders don't believe Powell will restrict himself from doing a 75 basis raise? Or is he saying that bond holders think 50 basis raises won't be enough and inflation will kill the bond prices in the future?\n\nSecond point is probably a controversial prediction: Cramer believes inflation is peaking, and that in 3 months things will look very different. He lists as examples (some of this is not covered in the article but I heard him say this on TV):\n\n* Cooper and aluminum prices dropping.\n* Good rain in US benefiting Soy Beans and also wheat prices going down.\n* Car prices new and old coming down.\n* Mortgage rate will cool demand.\n* The only thing that will not go down is oil.\n\nI know how people feel about Cramer, but if possible would like to hear your take on this based on substance and not just \"lol Cramer sucks.\" I'm not saying he doesn't suck, it's just that regardless of who the messenger is, these are just starting points for discussion so let's just stipulate that yes you hate him but let's dissect his points.

I haven't had that level of success since, but at least have seen some modicum of improvement with the latest release. \n\nWith that said, I hope that as less interventions occur in high density areas, the ones in the lower density ones start to get more actionable adjustments and hopefully, these don't negatively affect the larger metro areas as they come in.  \n\nI think it will get there eventually, but unless you drive in a large city, you probably won't feel confident using a robotaxi anytime soon. I would love to send my car out to make money for me, but doubt it will be ready for another five years at least (near me), but based on influencers in metro areas, I think those areas could be ready much sooner.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["tsla"]}

We had negative growth in the first quarter. The second quarter ends in June, so if that quarter is negative, they will officially announce it's a recession in July. If I am correct that the bear market started at the beginning of November, then if it's an average bear market it will end in August. I'm saving as much cash as I can until then. Of course I could be wrong because I'm just going by averages, but I am literally betting money that end of July to beginning of August time frame will be the best time to invest. If I'm wrong and it recovers before then, then at least my current investments are up.
