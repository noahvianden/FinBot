The extreme reds in the heatmap are limit supply sells or limit cash buys. The longer it stays, the more red it is. It can take days or weeks or months to move from one extreme to another. If someone has to 1 billion liquid cash buy limit at a lower price, the price will move up to find a seller with large supply at a higher price, then move down towards the buyer to fill his order. That is the longer price action movement that act like magnets.\n\nIn intraday trading, you have buyers and sellers who are constantly fighting each other. Watch the bookmap live session, they do play games. Sellers and buyers do fakeouts to spoof the market. A reversal before supply or demand zone is buyers getting run over by sellers or sellers getting run over by buyers. \nI can also see when the price is going to consolidate or go range bound when you have two pegs trapping price action, it can\u2019t go nowhere except sideways.\n\nThe large limit buys are not moving with the rally, they have a peg under $300 for SPY and have been there forever waiting to get filled.  They\u2019re just patiently waiting for the intraday buyers to push price up towards the supply peg and trigger a booby trap. As you can see, everything has been making newer lows since January. A bear market rally is simply price accumulating supply and moving down towards large buyers. When you see large limit buy orders moving up with the price, then this starts a bull run. But why would they want to trigger a SPY bull run at $400 when they can bring the price down to an extreme level like $100-$200, then start another bull run. Look left, 10 years ago, SPY was at $130. \n\nLike I said, a bull run is when you have the large buyers supporting the intraday buyers.
