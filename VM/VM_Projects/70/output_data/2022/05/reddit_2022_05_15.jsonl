From the time he was a young man my uncle worked as an engineer for gas transmission companies. First Columbia Natural gas then it merged with Northern Natural Gas, then it became Internorth, and then it merged with Houston gas to become Enron. \n\nAt one point my uncle became senior Vice President of Enron. When he retired he had never sold a single share of stock in any of the company, which included his market purchases and stock options and his reinvesting the dividends into more shares. \n\nOne day about six months before Enron D-Day he decided to divest his multimillion share position. Why did he decide that? Because he had friends. \n\nSo millions of shares went into the hands of suckers. They lost everything and my uncle raked it in. This is what happens in Wall Street. It\u2019s quiet behind the scenes, they don\u2019t broadcast it to the world, just their friends. They make a play, run it up the flagpole bail out and bankrupt the suckers.
