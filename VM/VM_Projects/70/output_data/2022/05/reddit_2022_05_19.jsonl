They're shoring up cash, because supply chain crisis is going to get worse when it comes to lithium and common metals involved in the battery production processes. While Tesla is ahead in many ways, certain basic materials are common across the entire auto stack no matter who the company is. This extra cash that's just \"sitting\" in a bank account is a hedge for the inevitable bottleneck that's going to pop up. They'll then use that cash to either become a supplier, assist a supplier, or acquire a supplier to address that bottleneck.\n\nAlso a stock buyback before a *potential* split in 3 months is purpose defeating, as the buyback will cause the stock price to explode upwards. Then even if the split happens, the post split share price will still be a lot higher than intended and the growth curve of that over the next say 5 years will be far steeper rather than gradual as desired. If we take the JP Morgan leaked email at face value, as a thought experiment, for the 20:1 split; then, here's the rub.\n\nCurrent price is \\~713, let's round down to 700 for easy math. A 20:1 split would drop that down to: $35/share, but will increase share volume by 20x. This means RSUs that can then be awarded to new employees at scale is far easier and as Tesla executes on its plans and product lines, that value will grow over time making it worth the employee's commitment to the company. Then a ramp from $35/share to say $350/share over a 3-5 year period (hypothetically) which I believe is the common vesting period for most RSU awards, means that if you got 100 RSUs at joining then by vesting period you'll have: a 10x ROI; 3500 --> 35000, which is fantastic.\n\nConversely, if Tesla announces a stock buy back, that's going to trigger a FOMO squeeze as people are going to (potentially) flood into the market to buy whatever supply is so that they can get a bigger return from Tesla or something. Either way, it'll drive the stock price up to lets say $1k (back to before current crash). Then a 20:1 split of that means Tesla is worth $50/share. That's a 30% difference at entry points, wherein RSU awards then will be lesser for new employees or existing employees (for comp), and equally the growth curve on that starts much higher before returning to $350 (as an example; where instead of getting 100 shares, you get 70 shares).\n\nMuch of this is napkin math and it could be wrong. But overall, I think its a bad idea for a buy back to occur. There's still a great deal of uncertainty in the market and giving up leverage to increase share price to satisfy a shareholder would go against the long term mission of the company ***and*** would make Tesla subscribe to the same philosophy of quarterly ROI behavior that it generally has been critical of the rest of the industry of. They have the moral and technical high ground because they don't resort to this behavior, and that's what sets them apart. The moment they give that up, a lot of criticism that has been shed like water on oil, will start sticking and that's a bad thing.  \n\n\n**In my personal opinion.**", "score": 27, "replies": [{"body": "You had me at *explode upwards*", "score": 10, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.17399102449417114}, {"body": "One possible scenario is that the stock is headed toward way below 500.

I just think retail investors are way more valuable than those big funds.\n\nMany people view things as 0 or 1, no middle ground. In this case, Tesla's cash will approach $30B after all the growth spending by end of next year. Spending a few billion on buyback is not hindering growth or cash reserve.  They could implement the buyback in a way to not push the stock higher, instead only buy when the stock crashes below certain level.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "That's certainly a possibility, perhaps its a trigger clause they'll invoke to prevent the margin call on Elon's collateralized shares. Though with him claiming, essentially that Twitter falsified reporting to the SEC for bot % reported and thereby has put the acquisition on hold, its unclear if the banks would in turn margin call him even if the price fell low enough? I'm not sure how this bit works, too little data--mostly speculation on my part.\n\nIn any case, I would still argue that engaging in a buy back when you are in a position of great strength seems unnecessary. According to the Q1 report: [https://tesla-cdn.thron.com/static/IOSHZZ\\_TSLA\\_Q1\\_2022\\_Update\\_G9MOZE.pdf?xseo=&response-content-disposition=inline%3Bfilename%3D%22TSLA-Q1-2022-Update.pdf%22](https://tesla-cdn.thron.com/static/IOSHZZ_TSLA_Q1_2022_Update_G9MOZE.pdf?xseo=&response-content-disposition=inline%3Bfilename%3D%22TSLA-Q1-2022-Update.pdf%22) | Tesla posted a $3.3Bn profit. They also said this:\n\n>Quarter-end cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities increased sequentially by $0.3B to$18.0B in Q1, driven mainly by free cash flow of $2.2B, partially offset by debt repayments of $2.1B. Our total debtexcluding vehicle and energy product financing fell to less than $0.1B at the end of Q1.\n\nAccording to that same slide deck, their operating expense for Q1 2022 was:\n\n>$1,857M\n\nTheir operating expense for the first three quarters of 2021 have been relatively consistent within a 12.5% range of their Q1 '22 operating expenses. My ability to read a slide deck is amateurish at best, and I could very well be wrong in this next segment; fair warning. With that said, if their operating expenses are \\~$1.8-2.2Bn per quarter going into 2022 and coupled with inflation and supply chain crisis, let's assume that the new range is actually between $2.2-2.5Bn/quarter, then given their cash and cash equivalents on hand, they can continue to operate as bound by their mission charter, for arguably another 7-8 months without making any additional operating revenue. This is obviously an ultra non-ideal scenario, but as a thought experiment, it gives them a great deal of runway to prioritize and determine next steps. *And*, they can do this without needing to incur any new debt to generate capital. Another 7 months (let's pick the lower bound) will put Tesla into basically end of the year timeframes. Q2 '22 will be crushed, but so will most of the market. I imagine things will improve into Q3 and onwards into more positively into Q4. Which will also provide Tesla sufficient time to navigate ongoing supply chain issues and ramp Giga Shanghai, Berlin, and Austin at least into 60-75% levels. Ultimately, all Tesla has to do is outdo its total car sales for Q1 '21 by say 5-10% with a depressed output as a result of Covid issues and supply chain pressures, and they still will win.\n\nQ3 and Q4 '22 will likely provide sufficient capital gain that not only will they have effectively $0 in debts on books, they'll likely have arguably $20-25Bn in cash + cash equivalents on the books. Which puts them into a position of immense strength and market flexibility relative to their peers, which are unlikely to see similar benefits. Let's also not forget that AI Day #2 is on August 19, 2022 this year. Which I believe falls within Q3 '22 and the outcome of that and the assailant lead it will show off then, will factor in quite a bit to Tesla's future market position.\n\nFor example, if they have a working ExaPod system of Dojo and they do a live demo of training a more commonly used model that takes X period of time on Nvidia systems and will now take X-10 period of time on Dojo and then give metrics on the benefits that has on their NN training periods, it will lead to huge upwards pressure on the stock. If they even have a working prototype of a bot that's able to navigate the environment in realtime with a live feed from the bot of the AI day audience, get onto the stage and do some action as basic as picking up a screw driver, picking up a bolt and then screwing that bolt into a dummy plug, that too will have immense upwards pressure on the stock.\n\nWe'll have to wait and see, but I think its too early in Tesla's journey as a company to engage in a buy back. Let's not forget that they're still ramping development of cybertruck, semi, the prototype of the robo-taxi, now bot, dojo, and they have on the horizon: hvac, powerwall 3, solar tiles, VPP, CCS supercharger update across their worldwide network, cathode and anode factories (as per battery day roadmap), lithium clay mining from Nevada clay fields (as per battery day roadmap) and whatever comes out of Master Plan Part Trois (which we are now in a holding pattern for that to drop).

Inflation is ***still*** going up and is now spreading to other sectors (such as services). There are more job openings than job seekers, so workers can bargain for higher wages causing a wage-price inflation spiral. Between these two factors, inflation looks like its going to be baked in\n2. The last time inflation was at current levels was in the 70s and early 80s (btw an infamously shit time for the stock market), at which time interest rates were \\~10%. Now we are at under 2%, so money is still cheap as fuck and the fed is not moving anywhere near fast enough\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[US Inflation](https://preview.redd.it/u89e9jmore091.png?width=709&format=png&auto=webp&s=549b6e76ddab84b7fbcca5324428a7f80ca88f98)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[US Interest rates](https://preview.redd.it/3qtv3ccsre091.png?width=718&format=png&auto=webp&s=540ede8e173134807acc5df3b9be071b03b2a284)\n\n3. To get a grip on inflation the fed is going to have to raise interest rates faster than planned, and the rule of thumb is, when interest rates rise, stock markets fall\n\n4. Since the fed overshot, a sharp rise in interest rates will engineer a recession, which paired with high inflation, means consumers will tighten their belts leading to worse company performance and some people needing to pull out of their savings (sell shares) to make ends meet: market sentiment will fall\n\n5. The market had massive stimulus from QE, stimulus checks and lockdowns where we had nothing to spend our money on, the party is now over and its time for the hangover: market sentiment will fall further\n\n6. Quantitative tightening will reduce market sentiments EVEN further and soon the boomers will start pulling out their money and retire further reducing sentiment and then after that the retards will pull out their money as the final dip is about to come. Market sentiments by this point will be somewhere below the earth's crust - this is when to buy back, and the moment is still a long way off until we get inflation under control and the recession starts\n\nIt takes no balls to hold, as holding means you dont have to do anything, it takes balls to sell - and I've sold retards!\n\nPiping hot regards,\n\n\\- Beargang", "id": "ut0psq", "created_utc": 1652957545.0, "score": 59, "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "num_comments": 72, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|28 seconds ago\n**Total Comments**|0|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|7 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=ut0psq)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=ut0psq)\n    \nHey /u/PurelyMedicated, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "[ok officer](https://imgur.com/a/gzwo4dI)", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2730599641799927}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.39933186769485474}, {"body": "Congratulations!

Borrow fees for UVXY shares have risen 3 days in a row.\n\nThere is tremendous money going into shorting UVXY and I don't think there is a way to stop it. No shares available to sell short, so the only option for us to try and mimic is to buy UVXY puts or sell UVXY calls (with what premium remains).\n\nMoral of the story, UVXY is doomed. This selloff is too controlled, VIX won't spike again, UVXY will crater. Market makers don't want us in on their trade either.\n\nI would just suggest buying UVXY puts right now over going long volatility or even buying stock.
