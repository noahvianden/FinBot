I remember making money on dumb names, that either don't exists or now penny stocks. \n\nHow thing went down, first high PE  shit names got demolished , volatility was high . One day market is up , then it wipes out previous gain and then some. \n\nThen when so.e screamed it's the bottom, real pain came for \nGood tech names , I remember AMZN was at $100 , then it around $36 . I think that's when retards who were still left in the market, where screaming its bottom , that was in 2007 pretty sure.\n\nThen real bottom came in 2008 , when spy got got down from 140 smth, to around 74. I might be off few dollars , but it was around 40% .\n\n\nBy that time , the last standing retards got wiped out . I remember my brokerage,  seized to exist as a company . \n\nWhy I mentioned the retailer I was working for ?\n\nWell, bfr recession in 2007 , I noticed that our sales were up like crazy (even profits where up at first ) , but #of items sold were down significantly from a year bfr. Then productivity started to fall drastically,  then net profit went down like crazy . Aka inflation.... \n\n\nSo past few weeks looking at p&l reports , sales are up 5% ... but # of item sold are down 15% from previous year .  \n\nI was trying to stay positive , and hoping maybe it's just location specific . Well, that went to shit few days ago after company reported earning ...  sales up 9% ,  net earnings are down 55% from same quarter a year ago. They barried net loss under reporting bureaucracy and stock went up . So you really had to read in to the numbers. \n\nI wasn't surprised,  because categories I was making 30% gross profit on, now I making like 1%... but labor cost went up like crazy, I m paying retards with a heart beat $5 more per hour from last year, and they got way less brain power then bfr . \n\nWell, make ur own conclusions from this shit post.
