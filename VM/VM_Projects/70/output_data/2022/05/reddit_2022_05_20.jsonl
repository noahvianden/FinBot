Those people didn't understand Tesla, but as more people started to understand Tesla, the stock experienced tremendous gains.\n\nNow, whenever I see Roku stock get brought up, I see similar kinds of misunderstandings.\n\nMany people misunderstand Roku's business thinking that they are just a hardware seller, but they are much more than that. Roku is selling the shovels to the streaming gold rush. Every streaming service has to give Roku a cut of their subscription revenue just to be on their platform. So, as the overall streaming industry grows bigger which it will, it doesn't matter which individual service is the leader since Roku will be collecting a cut of the revenue from all of them. In addition, Roku has a great ad business, and they collect tons of data about customer preferences across all of the streaming services and that data is very valuable to advertisers. It is also valuable for use internally to help them deliver the content that people want as they grow their own streaming service into yet another source of revenue.\n\nRoku also gets the competition fears with people thinking that Apple, Google, and Amazon are going to hurt Roku. It is like people think that this competition is new. But, in fact; Apple, Google, and Amazon have been competition for Roku for many, many years (Google and Amazon since about 2014, and Apple since 2007 before Roku was even released). Yet Roku continues to beat them in owning the most market share year after year after year with no signs of that changing.\n\nI don't always agree with everything that Cathie buys (I don't believe in her 3rd largest holding for example), but I'm with her on this one.

Dot-com overpriced a new industry that did in fact come to dominate, just indiscriminately and too early. \u201808 had to do with some very complicated financial theory in rather obscure instruments mostly unavailable to retail investors. The Big Short makes it look easy, in reality it takes a lot of complicated math to figure out. So much so that once the bubble was completely dissected it still took months to figure out how to price them.\n\nAnd as an addendum, the money supply and inflation being rampant also mean asset prices aren\u2019t as high as they appear.
