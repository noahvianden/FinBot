Would you put your money in the stock market if it hasn't been going up for the last 100 years straight? Of course not. So the market is falling because the prevailing opinion is that stocks will be cheaper in the future than they are today. In a sense, this is a self-fulfilling prophecy, everyone wants to sell, not so many people buying, you do get that natural reduction in trade price- everybody who sells their stock has to find a buyer willing to buy that stock.\n\nSo more than anything else, the market goes up and down based on what people/algos/MMs/everyone else expects the market to do over the next few months/years. This is more or less why the saying \"be greedy when others are fearful\" works, and why the market ALWAYS rebounds earlier than most people expect it to.\n\nThis \"timing of the bottom\" is virtually impossible and I see people justifying their selling in all sorts of ways.

They see the line go down, and then say, \"look at the business failing!\"\n\nThe fucking S&P is down 20% this year, you dummy.

The company is undeniably undervalued. Buying it *now,* at $10, is a better buy, but that doesn't make someone stupid to have bought at $15. It just means they got unlucky with their entry.
