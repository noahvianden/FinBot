They're currently around 5k/week now and they aim to be around 10k/week sometime next year.

The reason the automotive company has such low multiples is not because there's some kind of hidden rule there.  It's because the industry is pretty much stagnated, and while those companies have sales, they have little to no growth;  and with services like uber and lyft, there's little chance that they will have growth moving forward the way they're operating now.  That's why pretty much all automotive companies are making a shift towards electric.  It's because they saw the demand for the Model 3 and wet themselves.\n\nThen there's debt management, good debt vs bad debt, but that's a whole other thing I don't want to go into right now.

No of course not, all debt is good debt at first it\u2019s only retroactively that it looks bad. Also TSLA debt isn\u2019t good debt if you want to talk about good debt TSLA debt is CCC rated that\u2019s well below investment grade that\u2019s junk bonds.

Then you bring up Uber and Lyft hurting traditional automakers value why don\u2019t you think this would hurt TSLA just as much? Uber\u2019s doing its own platform, Lyfts partnering with all traditional automakers, google making own platform, GM making its own platform never mind other players (Apple, drive.ai etc).
