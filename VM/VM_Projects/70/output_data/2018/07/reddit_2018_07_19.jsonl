Airbus and Boeing can't keep up with the growth alone, and the aircraft manufacturers don't need to worry about decreasing margins on air travel, obviously.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Well the thing is Airbus and Boeing have been a duopoly for 20 years now and they each have designed their planes with similar cockpits which saves time training crew when airlines get new planes. Competitors will not only have to make cost effective aircraft on pricing and efficiency alone but the commonality Boeing and Airbus have implemented as well. Then there's the discounts loyal customers get which no one really knows how much they pay for so that's another barrier for new entries. \n\nFurthermore with the recent deals with Bombardier and Embraer, Airbus and Boeing are now cornering the whole commercial market range from small regional jets to narrow body and wide body mainliners. If China and Russia are going to break Airbus and Boeing their sales prospects will be limited to their countries because their governments own both the companies that manufacture the planes and the airlines that buy them. \n\nEdit:\n\nThe Chinese have a plane called the COMAC C919.\nIts main advantage is its price tag of $50 million which is 30% cheaper than its two competitors the 737 and A320. \n\nHowever that's because it's not made of the same materials as western aircraft, in fact it uses a lot more aluminum and not enough composites which will make the aircraft more costly to operate due to the impact aluminum's heavy weight will have on the plane's range and payload capabilities. \n\nComposites are incredibly expensive and for now only Boeing and Airbus can afford it, allowing them to make multi-market aircraft due to the lightness of the material. Smaller planes can now fly further and larger planes can carry less passengers and still make a profit, which means they can fly to new markets from the usual expensive hubs. Like New York to Xiamen China. You can't do that on aluminum built aircraft because the fuel burn will be so high it will demand the aircraft to be at least 70% full to make a profit, composites can bring that threshold down to a lower number and that allows big planes to be versatile and naturally cost effective. \n\nYou don't need to be a small plane to fly short routes and you don't need a big plane to fly long routes anymore, you can have mid sized jet that can fly to both markets! Composites are the key ingredient and it's only until the Russians and Chinese master it will they be able to be considered a major threat.
