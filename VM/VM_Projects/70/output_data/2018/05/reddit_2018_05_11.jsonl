He was worth about $9.2bln when he finally committed suicide.\n______\nIt looks like we are finally back on track with the perma-bull market. I made some bat-shit crazy trades during these last few months when we experienced about 8 mini-recessions. Overall: I lost more money than if I had just held.\n\nBeen feeling really crappy about it these past couple months and came across this story. Honestly -- I can understand why he jumped in front of that train despite still being a billionaire.
