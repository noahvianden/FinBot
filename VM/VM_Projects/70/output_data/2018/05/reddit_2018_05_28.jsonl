{"title": "Swing trading options - what am I missing here?", "selftext": "I've been a stock trader for awhile now, now I'm learning about options as I want to get into them...please excuse my ignorance here but I'm really trying to learn.\n\nIs it possible to swing trade options like stocks?

If you had bought a bunch of contracts on April 30 at $0.51 and sold now (at the time of writing, $2.53), that's a 400% profit. As opposed to buying and selling the stock, which would only give you about a 30% profit for the same period of time.\n\nThis seems way too easy though, so what am I missing? Is it the lack of liquidity of the option? Open interest is only at 1181 at the time of writing, and if I had bought say, $10,000 worth of AMD calls on April 30 that would be a few thousand contracts. I'm super confused as people seem to do this on subs like /r/wallstreetbets though. \n", "id": "8mpvpj", "created_utc": 1527512433.0, "score": 20, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 71, "comments": [{"body": "It's all about risk.

I\u2019m a reader, I recommend picking up a book (fairly up to date one, at least one that was written post-internet era and is still generally applicable in the way option orders work, as it\u2019s certainly different than what a book in the 80s would have said, if there was one).  Choice is up to you, search the sub for \u201crecommend books\u201d or something similar and you\u2019ll see plenty of suggestions.\n\nIF you\u2019re a reader, I say go for a book, you\u2019ll read when you wouldn\u2019t be looking online.  Also, a good book already sold you, you bought it, and so it pushes no agenda, and the authors is incentivized by sales to have the most informative book, especially in the current retail market where people likely put equal or greater trust in strangers\u2019 Amazon reviews than the vestiges of how it used to be pre-amazon and yelp, ie consumer reports, industry/hobbyist magazines, and word of mouth.  I don\u2019t know who the go to for book reviews was, I\u2019m guessing NYT always ran a book critic column, and perhaps trading mags would have reviewed some.  Big, needless tangent I\u2019m writing here, but what a change.  Anyway, point being, an author should generally just be out to be helpful as good reviews will drive sales.  Free books (or even worse, this \u201cApiary fund\u201d which is really a \u2018school\u2019 built to sap you money.   See below for a note on the subject) are.not to be trusted, the adage there\u2019s no such thing as a free lunch is pretty much always applicable to investing.   Nobody is giving away trade secrets for free.\n\nIf you are tempted by a class of some sort, ideally look for something in your town or city that does community adult education.  Generally it\u2019ll be $10-50 for this sort of thing, depending on the length.  The idea being, community centers and non profits are not trying to squeeze your money, so not only is the lesson  cheap, it\u2019s centered on teaching, not selling.  Many \u201cfree\u201d classes advertised (You\u2019ll see RE investing most commonly, though no doubt people do it for options) are really excuses to get you in a room where you feel trapped and give you the hard sell.  Usually some variation of, here\u2019s a tiny bit of info, now to get the real secrets just pay $5000 for this week course, or something similar.  Avoid these like the plague, they have no wisdom to offer and just want your cash.\n\nSimilar to community adult ed, university related classes also have no hidden agenda, so if you find an options course you could audit or mmmmm or something, you could go for it.  I didn\u2019t go to business school or major in economics or anything so I don\u2019t know if they have whole classes on options, but perhaps at least one that covers the market along with options, maybe even futures.\n\nBut time-wise, you\u2019ll get the info quickest reading online or reading a book, and you\u2019ll learn quickest by doing, no amount of reading will prep you or teach you as trading will.
