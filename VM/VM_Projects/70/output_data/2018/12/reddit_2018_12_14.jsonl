But I've seen enough Faraday Futures and Fisker Karmas (both of which have gone bankrupt) to know that a good cause doesn't necessarily equate to success.

I don't invest in companies or fields that I don't know very well, but for those that I have researched extensively (e.g TSLA) I go aggressively. I've never invested in Cryptos for that reason (which has served me well). I think that's a much better way to be cautious than blindly investing in a bunch of companies at once, with the winners and losers averaging each other out.\n\nI could see investing in a diversified ETF if the market itself is likely to grow exponentially, but it's difficult to know who the industry leader will be (e.g cannabis).
