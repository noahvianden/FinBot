I entered the workforce around 2013, when things were seemingly getting good again after the recession, so I don't have first hand experience with market falls, only horror stories. \n\nAnyway, the last few months make me want to slow down on buying and keep cash. Not because socks are going down and I'm seeing losses (I know that's normal), but because I'm afraid of layoffs and being unemployed for a while if companies go on hiring freezes.\n\nIs the any logic to this or am I missing out and being dumb? Should I continue my monthly investments as usual? I have about 6 lean months of expenses in cash. \n\n**Edit:** \n\nThis thread is an extremely interesting read. I can't believe the range of opinions and amounts for efunds that have been mentioned here. To clarify: I was never going to sell anything or stop investing entirely. I was however debating whether to invest a bit less a month and use the rest to increase my emergency savings a bit.
