{"title": "Enron Musk", "selftext": "Boy those Q3 earnings for Tesla look good ... but they look a little too good, and especially too good to have lost their entire accounting department over earlier in the year.  ... indeed why would an entire department leave over the year (CAO twice this year alone) when the numbers are so perfect and rosy?  Has that ever happened to a company where what was under the surface wasn't more then a little bit rotten?\n\nInteresting note on the technical side, look at the $280 mark.  Notice whenever Tesla gets down approaching the 280 mark for too long Musk will do something insane and unprofessional (though entertaining for those of us on the side-lines) usually involving tweets until the stock starts coming back up again.  Why would 280 be this critical Maginot line for Tesla?  ... oh that is right a tremendous amount of Tesla debt is in convertible bonds, so as long as he can keep the [delusion going strong enough, he can just pay all that off with stock instead of money](https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-stocks-surge-puts-convertible-bonds-in-the-money-1533667505), and the people who will foot the bill are his dumb fan boys who don't understand fundamentals and keep his stock as grossly overvalued as it is.  I won't bet on Tesla stocks (and especially not its bonds), but I'll bet anyone here we will see some new and amazingly entertaining feats of Musk the next time the stock gets down towards the 280 mark for too long any time between now and whenever most of Tesla's conversable debt gets covered \u2013 paid off almost literally by the delusions of those who hang on Musk's words.\n\nYou can call me a dumb autistic fag, but here are some initial analyses by serious analysts that are far less dumb, autistic, and/or faggy then me:\n\n**1.** [What I (Wolf Richter) Think about Tesla's Financials](https://wolfstreet.com/2018/10/24/what-i-think-about-teslas-financials/)\n\n**2.** [Q3 Results Secured](http://adventuresincapitalism.com/2018/10/25/q3-results-secured/?utm_source=AIC&utm_campaign=e78d00bb92-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2018_10_25_12_55&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_cb61762784-e78d00bb92-31426413)\n\n\"I am sorry about your short position [looser].\"  I get this a lot, but full disclosure: I have never bet on or against Tesla; not now and not previously (though I have often joked about doing so).  I avoid it because one does not bet on a meme, as the valuation of a meme is entirely based on mass delusion and not reality \u2013 fundamentals do not apply ... until they absolutely can not be ignored anymore.\n\n  ... but here is the funny thing, you know the expression \"fake it until you make it?\"  It is actually a very true little bit of life wisdom.  Lets say you want to be a day trader, you do something like come to wsb, pretend your hot shit, keep your eyes and ears open, learn from your mistakes while also learning to cover them up better (or whore them proudly for karma), learn the lingo and eventually move onto bigger and better things as you slowly work your illusion into reality.  If you manage to keep at it long enough you typically succeed eventually.\n\nWhat does this have to do with Tesla?  Well Musk has ingeniously built an entire empire of illusion \u2013 the debt necessary to finance this (currently) unsustainable empire is highly convertible so it is based on stock whose valuation is a deranged disillusion and he freely manipulates through more illusion \u2013 its illusion all the way down and he has mastered it.  Eventually if Musk can keep rolling the illusion over and refinancing with more illusion (and he has been doing it successfully for years, so why would he fail now?) Tesla will actually slowly build up and potentially become viable because Musk is slowly building real things in the background and improving them.  Yes, I am suggesting that Musk may literally be succeeding at faking a multi-billion dollar transnational corporation into existence until it does actually, factually, and sustainably exist on its own (as of yet not fully existing) merits.\n\nMusk isn't free and clear yet, he needs to keep rolling and financing illusions with more illusions through at least Q1 2020, and if the wrong (right?) people dig too deeply at things like this quarters earnings reports the whole thing could unravel and disappear.  I certainly am not planning on investing Tesla any time soon, but that said he is doing it and doing it well enough that I am even less planning on shorting Tesla any time soon either.  Indeed I am beginning to think I may have to apologize for calling him \"Enron Musk,\" not because he isn't running a giant shell game of lies, illusion, and delusion, but because unlike Enron he succeeding at it and may actually manage to pull off the magic trick that Enron never could even hope to: flip it into something real and self sustaining without most people noticing it wasn't always that way.  I have come to realize the man is a genius \u2013 just keep him away from my money.\n\n------------------\n**P.S. to mods:** I read the rules before posting, it seems like 95% of the posts on this sub violate those, do you really ban people for that stuff (if so how are there any participants left on this sub) or is it just meta humor?", "id": "9rdgok", "created_utc": 1540495802.0, "score": 21, "upvote_ratio": 0.58, "num_comments": 73, "comments": [{"body": "Hello /u/Old_Bit, welcome back.", "score": 43, "replies": [{"body": "knew that neanderthal would be back. surprised he didn't pick a more obvious username although uglyneckbeard is probably as accurate as it gets.", "score": 9, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.27131572365760803}, {"body": "psssh, oldbit never wrote his own content he only linked articles pasted screenshots of sentences from them", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2463320940732956}, {"body": "When was he banned?", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "When you deleted the account.", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "When was that?", "score": -3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.16140753030776978}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3933440148830414}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2701724171638489}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.15705172717571259}, {"body": "maybe the numbers are legit but they just fucking hated the working environment? \n\neveryone that works with Musk says he's a micromanaging a-hole. i work with one of his former counsels lol.

CAGR and TAM are key factors in estimating valuation multiples.\n\nThe third key factor, however, in estimating an appropriate revenue multiple is profitability, which I discuss in the following section.\n\nProfitability\n\nThis is the primary point of divergence between the TSLA bull and bear camps. While bulls expect Tesla to be sustainably profitable and cash flow positive going forward, per management guidance, bears used to believe that Tesla would never turn profitable, and now having moved the goal post, bears predict that 2H18 profits will not be sustainable. I beg to differ.\n\nThe key variable that will determine whether or not Tesla as a company will be profitable going forward is the Model 3 gross profit margin, which has been deeply negative since July of 2017, primarily due to the straight-line  method that Tesla employs to depreciate most of its fixed assets, which leads to depreciation expense overwhelming any revenue and profits from Model 3 deliveries during the initial stages of production, when high fixed costs are allocated over low production numbers.\n\nThe timing mismatch of revenues and expenses described above was also the case in 2H12 during the Model S production ramp, as well as 1H16 during the Model X production ramp. Both periods of intense fear, uncertainty, and doubt were followed by significant increases in the stock price. I expect this time to be the same, primarily due to the following concept.\n\nContribution Margin vs. Gross Margin\n\nThis distinction is hugely important, especially in Tesla's case. Please note the following formulae for the two accounting terms:\n\nContribution Profit = Price - Variable Cost\n\nGross Profit = Price - Variable Cost - Fixed Cost\n\nIn accounting, margin simply means any profit metric divided into revenue:\n\nGross Margin = Gross Profit divided by Revenue;\n\nOperating Margin = Operating Profit divided by Revenue; and\n\nNet Profit Margin = Net Profit divided by Revenue.\n\nAn Example\n\nFor a Model 3 Long Range that is sold in 2Q18 at an average selling price (\"ASP\") of $55,000 and an estimated variable cost per unit of $35,000, the contribution profit per unit would be $20,000, and the contribution margin would be 36 percent, calculated as $20,000 divided by $55,000.\n\nFor financial reporting purposes, companies allocate fixed costs to periodic revenues generated from various products and services, and across time periods, in accordance with General Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\"). In agreement with their auditors, companies choose from several fixed cost allocation methods.\n\nIn Tesla's case, \"fixed cost\" primarily means the depreciation of the capital expenditures previously spent to build factories, and purchase and install machinery and equipment necessary in building the products; and the depreciation method used for most fixed assets is straight-line method.\n\nFor the purposes of this article, I assume that fixed cost allocation to Model 3 approximated $18,000 per Model 3 delivered in Q2, or slightly more than $300 million. Please note that this is a simplifying assumption for illustration purposes.\n\nUsing assumptions, I estimate that per-unit Model 3 gross profit in Q2 was:\n\n$55,000 - $35,000 - $18,000 = $2,000 per Model 3;\n\nand gross margin was:\n\n$2,000 divided by $55,000 = 3.6 percent.\n\nIn summary, I roughly estimate that:\n\nQ2 Model 3 contribution margin was 36 percent; and\n\nQ2 Model 3 gross margin was 3.6 percent.\n\nAgain, please note that the above calculations are primarily for illustration purposes, and the error bars are wide, but the discussion is still important, as I explain below.\n\nQ3 Application\n\nAssuming that the above estimates are reasonable, and adding the simplifying assumption that Tesla did not incur any incremental fixed cost in Q3, then:\n\n37,400 more Model 3's delivered in Q3; multiplied by,\n\n$20,000 contribution profit per Model 3; equals,\n\nnearly $750 million in incremental contribution profits in Q3.\n\nMore importantly, however, the $330 million in fixed cost is now allocated over 37,400 more units (55,800 in Q3 vs. 18,400 in Q2), which means that the fixed cost allocation per unit drops from $18,000 in Q2 to $6,000 in Q3, and the gross profit per unit then becomes:\n\n$55,000 - $35,000 - $6,000 = $14,000 gross profits per Model 3; and\n\n$14,000 divided by $55,000 = 25 percent gross margin\n\n25 percent gross margin in Q3 is obviously too good to be true, and that's because of our simplifying assumption that Tesla did not incur any incremental fixed costs in Q3, which is likely false.\n\nLet us next flex this assumption.\n\nIt's impossible to know exactly how much in incremental fixed costs Tesla incurred in Q3. I suspect, however, that Tesla did not incur significant amount of incremental fixed costs, since Model 3 weekly production rate was already at ~5,000 at the end of June. Instead, Tesla likely focused on stabilizing production, reducing downtime, and accelerating existing lines.\n\nFor illustration purposes, let's assume that Tesla incurred $290 million in incremental fixed cost for a total of $620 million in Q3; in which case, the gross profit per unit then becomes:\n\n$55,000 - $35,000 - $11,000 = $9,000 in gross profits per Model 3; and\n\n$9,000 divided by $55,000 = 16 percent gross margin\n\nYou can see how sensitive the gross margin is to this specific assumption. We did not even \"sensitize\" the variable cost per unit assumption, which is a whole another article. We can, however, discuss one more variable.\n\nOne More Thing: ASP\n\nIn the above example, we assumed $55,000 ASP in both Q2 and Q3, which we know is false. In fact, the ASP for Model 3 increased from $55,000 to $60,000+ in Q3; in which case, the gross profit per unit then becomes:\n\n$60,000 - $35,000 - $11,000 = $14,000 in gross profits per Model 3; and\n\n$14,000 divided by $60,000 = 23 percent gross margin\n\nBased on survey data, we can reasonably conclude that Model 3 ASP jumped by 10 percent from Q2 to Q3, primarily due to surprising demand for the Dual Motor option, which gives me high confidence that Model 3 gross margin will be closer to 20 percent than the previous management guidance of 15 percent.\n\nThis is important, as the difference between 15 and 20 percent Model 3 gross profit margin in Q3 could add up to as high as $200 million in bottom-line profits, and could be the difference between profitability or not.\n\nBottom Line\n\nEven though we cannot exactly know how much in incremental fixed costs Tesla incurred from Q2 to Q3, we do know that the ASP jumped, and it likely jumped more than management had previously estimated, since demand for Dual Motor was surprising to everyone.\n\nFurther, we can also reasonably conclude that Tesla did not double Model 3 fixed costs from Q2 to Q3, since the production rate did not materially change throughout the quarter.\n\nBoth the fact that the Model 3 ASP jumped, while the fixed costs likely did not increase significantly, bode well for Model 3 gross margin. As a result, I  estimate that Model 3 gross margin will be 17 percent in Q3, but I would not be surprised if it approached 20 percent.\n\nIf this is true, and as a result Tesla turns significantly profitable in Q3, then the current enterprise value to forward revenue multiple of 1.1x is too low, especially given that Tesla's year-over-year revenue growth will accelerate in the coming quarters, and it will do so profitably.\n\nThe key variable will be the Model 3 gross profit margin and by looking at  their report what does that tell you?

Where is he expecting the 3x revenue generation from in one years time?  More importantly why is this analyst using revenue to evaluate a company, profit is what matters for a sustainability \u2013 this is only the third profitable quarter ever (and that is generously assuming this numbers are real) with one of the other only profitable quarters being when they sold a bunch of pollution credits (which is to say they got a massive free handout from California).  A company that makes $50B in revenue, but loose say \u2013$10B once factoring in expenses should have a lower valuation then a company that makes only $10B in revenue, but actually has $2B in profit.  I have to say I fundamentally disagree with how this analyst is evaluating the forward value of companies generally.  Apple may be vastly overvalued, but at least it sustainably makes profits, and bigger ones then Tesla.\n\n> The key variable that will determine whether or not Tesla as a company will be profitable going forward is the Model 3 gross profit margin, which has been deeply negative since July of 2017, primarily due to the straight-line method that Tesla employs to depreciate most of its fixed assets, which leads to depreciation expense overwhelming any revenue and profits from Model 3 deliveries during the initial stages of production, when high fixed costs are allocated over low production numbers.\n\nYes, they changed their accounting procedure for this earnings report (and a bunch of accountants had to quit for this earnings report in its current form to be made possible).

If you give me enough beers, I can dream up a list of one-off reasons that a car may be sold without payment having occurred, but I will struggle to give you $585 million reasons (red).

Sounds logical and all, except Q4/2017 also ended on a Sunday and accounts receivable showed a 15.2% sequential decline. Back then, energy generation, services and other (the things that normally have accounts receivable) were 17.8% of sales, today they are 10.6% of sales.

{"title": "Global Truth && The coming recession DD", "selftext": "TL;DR: I sold my entire retirement almost 4 weeks ago. I started shorting SPY and C two weeks ago. I put all of it into TSLA on monday. If you want to know why, read on:\n\nThis is not the everything bubble. We are in the *misinformation* bubble. As soon as I read about the Khashoggi murder on zerohedge, I put into motion the actions i mention above. Here is why: I actually remembered the Khashoggi name from reading an article last year when Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) locked up a bunch of billionaire saudis for *corruption*, the richest among them was Al Waleed Bin Talal (AWT). Apparently last year AWT gave a phone call to Jamal Khashoggi (the killed journalist), inviting him to Saudi Ariabia to \"help him be a part of Mohammed Bin-Salman's Vision for Saudi Arabia\", *right before everyone was arrested.* Lets look at AWT's assets:\n\n**Al-Waleed Bin Talal Owns:**\n\n- the Saudi State media aparatus, which threatened a 9/11 style attack on canada last month\n\n- the top floors of the mandalay bay hotel, where the las vegas massacre happened by some random millionare who got money from 'gambling', and targeted trump supporters\n\n- citigroup, the bank that hand-picked obama's cabinet\n\n- he may still have a lot of FOX, TWTR, JD, but during the corruption arrest I think he may have given some of these up\n\n\n- >the 65th-largest private yacht in the world, the 85.9-meter (282-ft) Kingdom 5KR (originally built as the Nabila for Saudi arms dealer **Adnan Khashoggi** in 1979). It was sold to **Donald Trump**, who renamed her the Trump Princess. Al-Waleed bought the yacht after Trump experienced financial problems in the late 1980s\n\nSo this guy is some kinda oil barron with a media empire and a bank powerful enough to run the executive branch of the USA, probably a hardcore muslim too. MBS on the other hand is liberalizing Saudi Arabia. He eliminated the power of the religious police, let women drive, and is heavily investing in renewable energy. He also looks stoned as fuck in every picture. \n\nErgodan is doing the opposite in Turkey, where Khashoggi was killed. \n\nI came to the conclusion that AWT was arrested for trying to kill Khashoggi last year. This means that the Turks and AWT are in cahoots to try to make MBS look bad to take his power away by killing the journalist, and to make it harder for trump to sweep the midterms. This belief was reinforced by the fact that the saudi oil minister came out against the killing and tried to pin it on MBS. The entire US news media which is owned by people heavily invested in a oil based economy are trying to pin it on MBS. MBS  is fighting for renewable energy and invested 2 billion into TSLA.\n\nThe King of SA probably loves all his sandshits unconditionally so any investigation will find no wrongdoing from these guys. But if not there is a good chance there will be a war. Good thing musk makes rocket ships. Musk if you're reading this please look at my resume, i'm a better coder than you, and it's even more obvious who satoshi is with all the anime crap :)\n\nInterest rates are going up because the FED has a bunch of democrats on the board that want like 5% interest rates (they totally changed their mind to this in the last meeting). Trade war is happening because trump wants car tarrifs to be 0. With tesla being the most shorted stock in the market, expect the market to crash as tesla moons to 640 in the next year. Invest accordingly and win a the new TSLA roadster.\n\n**I think Trump and MBS already won**\n\nGood luck out there!

Right now it seems energy is controlled by Islamo-fascists, Labor is controlled by Communists, and the Matter aka capital is controlled by the banks. What's missing here that is also missing from Einstein is the value of information. The information of a region of space dictates its gravitational effects. GR doesn't mesh with QM because all matter has a wavefunction, which creates only a region of probabilities of where stuff can be. The harmonics of systems of matter wavefunctions is almost certainly what gives rise to 'dark matter'. It's actually just virtual matter. This is why dark matter has a donut shape around spiral galaxies as well as why electron orbitals have donut shapes around atomic nuclei. Black holes will have dark matter donuts that dictate the rotations of stuff around them. This is why the stars rotate faster than the gas around the central black hole.
