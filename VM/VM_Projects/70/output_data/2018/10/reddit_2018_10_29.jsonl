Though it sounds like while your losses were heavy, it hasn't ruined your current financial situation. For that, be thankful. It could be MUCH worse for your approach.\n\nWith that being said, if you want to earn money in the market you have to give it time for it to work for you. I'd highly recommend firstly buying a S&P index fund. This is a fund you will never have to sell, so you can continue buying it at your own pace. It is a low-risk investment tool that, according to Warren B, is the smartest choice you can make. \n\n\nAfter you feel confident with at least 50-75% of your portfolio being in a S&P fund, (depending on preferences) I would then recommend finding companies with fantastic leadership and gigantic moats. By moat - I mean, their ability to ward off competition. \n\nAfter you ID'd these companies, check to see their financials. Is their EPS growing? IS their revenue growing? IS their debt manageable for their industry? Is their PEG ratio relatively low for their industry?\n\nFrom this type of information, you can gauge in your head what the company is roughly worth. Then, using it's current market cap to stock price ratio, see what price you would purchase it for. If the current price is lower - buy. If it is higher - find out why you think that the market thinks it is more expensive than it is. Usually it is based upon growth, so if you agree that the future hurdles it will come across it can swiftly navigate then buy.\n\n\nHope this helps!
