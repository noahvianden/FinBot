Trump doesn't GAF about bringing back manufacturing. His goal is to lift Chinese protectionist policies that adversely affect American businesses, and to alleviate intellectual property theft. He could have gone to the WTO like Obama, which accomplishes nothing, but instead he delivered his demands through Steve Mnuchin and levied tariffs on Chinese goods during a global bull market. He then simultaneously filed a complaint with the WTO to litigate the issue. But given China's history of violating our trade agreements, the only way theyll abide by any agreement made is if they're forced to. These tariffs have had a devastating effect on the Chinese economy, as you can see. They will either be forced to open their markets or completely overhaul their economic system to mimic the west.  Either of these options are to our benefit. \n\n\nhttps://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=724017066103123094127022026110090022026080077013030029112113029026092024106081083073011056033056027005107124087121031066075014046072056061077090125125093096124109089028058087082107115095090023083082091011101016064027075100098111082010022115090102097093&EXT=pdf", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Love how you got down-voted for posting a substantiated argument.
