{"title": "As Of Today, Market Is Officially In A Correction", "selftext": "Hello fellow autists. Just thought i'd do a quick post briefly comparing February and October to give an idea of where the market is at as well as define a few terms that are often thrown around without knowing the meaning. I know it's fun to scream RECESSION! CORRECTION! DEPRESSION! LONG $ROPE! but it's good to know when to actually use them too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPullback: -5% in major indices (DOW, S&P500, NASDAQ)\n\nCorrection: -10%+\n\nBear Market: -20%+\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**February (1/26 - 2/8)**\n\nDOW: -10.4%\n\nS&P 500: -10.13%\n\nNASDAQ: -9.7%\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Approximately 3 months of gains wiped.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**October (10/3 - TBD)**\n\nDOW: 8.4%\n\nS&P 500: -9.4%\n\nNASDAQ: -12.3%\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Approximately 10 months of gains wiped. Correction not over yet.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's pretty interesting to see that the run ups in the market are getting less steep, corrections more frequent, volatility higher, etc. This is all happening while the business cycle, in my opinion, is absolutely peaking and near the end. These levels of growth in the USA are unsustainable and are very representative of the overheating stage of the economy in the cycle.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe're all absolutely fucked before 2020. But for real, hope learning a few terms and comparing the OCT to FEB was interesting. Notably in history 1 in every 5 corrections ends in a bear market but most of the time they are healthy for the market.\n\nThanks for stopping by to listen to the dumb shit I have to say.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHappy trading fellow autists!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: AMD memes today\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/1kxoxxiy87u11.png", "id": "9r3etm", "created_utc": 1540413040.0, "score": 185, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 68, "comments": [{"body": "This all started because mods banned the prayer stonk gods still upset and need those sacrificial puts from everyone to please them.
