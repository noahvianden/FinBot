Zero. Zilch.\n\nSo every dollar I pay out in purchasing TSLA stock doesn\u2019t benefit Tesla or its vision. All it does is benefit whoever sold me their shares.

The money goes straight to Tesla\u2019s pocketbook, and you get to enjoy the car.\n\nBut if you\u2019re gonna buy the stock, then you have to be willing to say, I\u2019m willing to buy it at x price, and I\u2019m no longer willing to buy it at y price.\n\nI don\u2019t own TSLA stock.
