This can be accomplished through reductions in government spending, tax increases, bond and securities issues, **interest rate increases** and transfer payment reductions. These adjustments to the fiscal conditions within the economy can help restore economic equilibrium. By shifting overall demand for goods, the adjustments control the amount of funds available to consumers. **As the amount of money within an economy decreases, the overall demand for goods and services also declines.** [(source)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inflationary_gap.asp)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\ntl;dr: 2008 caused 2019", "score": 40, "replies": [{"body": "Mmmmm this is the kind of response i was hoping to fish out of the shitposts.
