{"title": "Bots in stock exchange - are they as rampant as some articles claim they are?", "selftext": "I've seen some articles talk about bots and how they are rampant in stock exchange, but are they really? It's not easy to find information on that but I've seen som articles talk about it. One example given in one of those articles was Amazon dropping $40 on June 9, 2017 in four seconds, then bouncing right back. It said \"an algorithm triggered a price switch and deceived other quants to follow suit\". Was this the actual reason or was it something else?\n\nI know that those bots built by others are scams, but could big companies or financial institutions be using bots for trading? What about people personally building their own bot? And this could be for stock exchange or other investment options like forex, CFDs or futures.\n\nEDIT: Wow! I didn't expect so many responses while I went to sleep! Thanks for your help. If anyone can link some reputable articles talking about this it would be great because I'm doing a presentation for college about technical analysis, and I'd like to end it talking a bit about bots/algorithms (I probably should call them algorithms in the presentation).\n\nEDIT2: just to clear some confusion, I wasn't saying bots are scams.
