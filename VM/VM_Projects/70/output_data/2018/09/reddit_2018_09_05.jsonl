SK Hynix announced a delay to the expansion of their new facility a few weeks ago which triggered the initial 5% rally. However a rumour going to press in 6 hours on [Digitimes](https://www.digitimes.com/topic/bits+chips/memory_chips/) is that \"Samsung, SK Hynix reportedly to defer expansion plans\".
