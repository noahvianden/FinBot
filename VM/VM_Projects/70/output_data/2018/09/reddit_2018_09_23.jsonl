{"title": "What and when was your most autistic play?", "selftext": "For me it was putting all my eggs in one basket in SVXY (stocks, not even options) at February. Yeah... Look at that drop baby. Lost $13000 out of my $18000 dollar portfolio. The thing was I was up near $5000 at that time too. \n\nThat was the dip that dipped on dipping (30 min timeframe).\n\nMy options autistic play was investing in MU 50c 9/21 calls and puts as a hedge to have losses on both. Then investing $1000 in MSFT calls, losing 70% and then selling to have it go up nearly 300% the next day (2 months ago) .  I'm just swinging it for now.\n\nToday, my autistics bros, I am only down a very fabulous 34% on my portfolio... we'll make it bois. Recovered from being down 70% on my portfolio (after being up 54%) to 34% through mostly swing trades and options.
