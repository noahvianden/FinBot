Top selling cars in their class doesn't mean a whole lot when their classes are $100K sedans/minivans and the competition for electric vehicles, is still limited. Tesla can't deliver Model 3s at the rate they need to, they've only been able to hit a pace at spurts where their rate matched what would be needed to make 3000 Model 3s a week. Even that is a pretty mild goal. Toyota was able to make 6000 cars a week over a decade ago at the same plant with less automation and the UAW and pre bankruptcy GM as partners. Pre bankruptcy GM, a company that gave us such brilliant products as the Hummer, Pontiac Aztek, and Chevrolet Vega. \n\nTesla is kind of at a catch 22 with the Model 3. They need to build more, and with higher priced options. But the more they deliver the more exposure they get as to what a crap product the Model 3 is. Shoddy built quality, and a terrible UX design. Everything is controlled through through the tablet. Break that and you're fucked. Like the girl who crashed one, hit the screen with her arm and couldn't unlock the glove box to get to her insurance paperwork. It's also your gauge cluster, radio, climate controls, range meter, etc. They cut corners left and right, as seen by mismatched paint, lack of an automotive grade touchscreen, and large panel gaps. \n\nRepairs are super expensive, and only Tesla can make them. I'd be surprised to see many still on the road after 5 years of ownership. The reduced carbon footprint of the electric drivetrain will be offset by the fact that these are going to be throwaway vehicles not built to last. They're approaching automobiles, products people typically use and resell and maintain for 10-20 years the way companies approach consumer electronics. You'd have to be nuts to buy a used one. \n\nApple might charge a premium for their products, but they last a long time, and have never had the QC issues Tesla has. Every Apple product I have still functions. Battery might not hold a charge, but I'm sure any past iPod I have i could power up and use. Might not be blazing fast anymore, but they still work.
