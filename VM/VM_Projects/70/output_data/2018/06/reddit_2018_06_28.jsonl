Most prescriptions for controlled substances are subject to both federal and state regulations. These regulations define how a prescription can be written, how your doctor can communicate it to a pharmacist, and how many times it can be refilled, among other aspects. For example, many controlled substances can only be refilled up to 6 months from the date of the original prescription, and medications with a higher potential for abuse (C2) cannot be refilled at all. All pharmacies, whether retail or home delivery, are subject to these regulations.\n\n**If your plan allows you to send a prescription for a controlled substance to the Express Scripts Pharmacy, you must send it by mail.** Some states have regulations that limit the number of days allowed for a C2 prescription to be received and filled by a pharmacy. To meet the intent of such regulations, the prescription must be postmarked within the specified number of days of the date the prescription was written. Express Scripts will fill prescriptions for controlled substances for up to a 90-day supply, if requested, subject to state regulations (for example, New York state law limits controlled substances to a one-month supply). Please note that certain plans may prohibit home delivery of C2 controlled substances. Even when a plan does allow for this, Express Scripts will not accept prescription requests for C2 controlled substances by phone or, as prohibited by federal law, by fax.\n", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I didn't say all schedule 2 drugs are banned nationwide, all I said was Pillpack doesnt distribute them, so my facts are straight and I'm not throwing shit out there.
