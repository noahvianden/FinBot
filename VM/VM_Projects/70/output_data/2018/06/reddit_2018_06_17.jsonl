These things are socialism. Socialism is antithetical to the free market, the more of the one you have, the less of the other. In the long term all the things I mentioned are objectively terrible compared to the free market versions, but also almost impossible to stop due to peoples' dependency, which is exactly why we shouldn't do them in the first place. There's way too much to get into if I was to prove those statements empirically, but I used to be a socialist and I changed my mind over many years through reading. So I do understand both sides.
