I can speak for my own rationale. \n\nI work in the supercomputer industry. Intel was once the prize-child of the industry. Customers wanted Intel inside; they had the latest and greatest and most stable-est tech. The tables have turned in the past 18-24 months. Intel started missing production deadlines, pushing out roadmaps, and failing to produce quality products (An aside here, supposedly Intel has been cutting corners in QA. There was a r/bestof writeup that was posted around when Spectre came to light of someone who worked in QA for Intel.) \n\nAnyways, when Intel (or any other supplier) misses deadlines, special-cases are triggered in contracts for supercomputers that incur heavy penalties on the contractor (Cray, IBM, HP, etc.). This makes the contractors unhappy. The customers are already unhappy because their $80 million computer will be 12 months late. So the contractors go looking for other suppliers.\n\nJust recently there has been a rising interest in AMD's processor tech as well as the ARM processor family. ARM processors are mainly used in mobile devices due to their high performance-per-watt. Companies that make ARM processors include Cavium, Nvidia, and Broadcomm. 18 months ago, this interest would have equated to sticking your toe in the bathwater. Now, customers and contractors alike are running full speed hand in hand with AMD and ARM and for good reason; these processors are better than Intel in almost every way. They are more performant and above all, they deliver on time and have a discernible roadmap for future products. \n\nBecause supercomputers are essentially just tightly networked personal computers, I use this trend as a very rough stencil for what the future will look like for the broader market. I'm long AMD. I'm long Nvidia. This kind of competition is healthy in a market dominated by Intel's frequently sub-par quality products. \n\nHit me up if you have any questions or concerns.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "When you say Intel is missing deadlines are these for high core count CPUs?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Yes.
