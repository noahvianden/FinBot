{"title": "Wanted: Positions which will profit from privacy/encryption boom", "selftext": "**Which stock titles will profit from the people's increasing need for privacy, encryption and anonymity?**\n\nBackground of my question: I am convinced that privacy and anonymity in the classical sense are currently extremely under-valuated. I expect a situation in the long-term future where consumers and companies will realize the true value of privacy and encryption (similar to the recent Facebook outrage, but on a much larger scale). Which stocks will profit from such a \"privacy boom\" most likely in the long run? I would like to setup a \"privacy portfolio\", and have thought about:\n\n* Symantec (classical AV provider with lots of knowledge about security threats)\n* Apple (have gone into opposition against US authorities despite claims to decrypt their services and devices)\n* Deutsche Telekom (German ISP who is used by Microsoft as a substitute cloud provider to keep the US government off German companies)\n* Providers of on-premise IT services (anti public cloud movement)\n\nThanks for views.\n\nUPDATE: I have created a first version of the portfolio. It is only a first draft, but I think I can use it for a start. I will try to update it once in a while...
