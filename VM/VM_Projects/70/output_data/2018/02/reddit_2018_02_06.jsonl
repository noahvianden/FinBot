I will say from the outset that no one can give you an unbiased picture of the situation; I certainly have my opinions and others have theirs. I'm sorry for the long explanation, but if you want the full story, you need to know all this...\n\nWe need to understand where we are at from a macroeconomic perspective right now. We are at an unprecedented time in human economic history: the Federal Reserve and central banks across the world have never held interest rates this low for this long. To put it in simple terms, making debt and credit cheap induce people to use more credit and debt. The central banks and the Fed used monetary policy (lowering interest rates) to stimulate the economy out of the Great Financial Crisis of 2008. The Fed and central banks around the world also printed $21 trillion in money in order to buy government debt; they printed money through a process called QE -- Quantitative \nEasing to give the government money to spend on bailouts and stimulus. Now, I think it's ultimately kicking the proverbial can down the road, but that's my opinion. \n\nBut, now we've come to a turning point in history. Ever since the stagflation of the 70s (after we let go of the gold-backed dollar), the US has had a 40 year bull market in bonds. [This means that interest rates have slowly been descending to 0%.](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FEDFUNDS) Now, we're pretty much at zero and we can't go lower anymore. The Fed has started to taper, meaning that it plans to get rid of bonds that it owns (this causes pressure on interest rates to go up). We have also seen signs that the economy is seeing increasing inflation. The job of the Fed is to make sure there isn't a lot of inflation. Rapid spikes in prices can have negative effects on the economy. \n\nSo now, we find ourselves at yet another turning point. [US bond yields have started to rise sharply.](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=US10Y) You can see the chart if you zoom out a bit. When government bond interest rates rise, the cost of credit goes up. Now, if you believe that we've been propping this economy up by using debt (and believe me, we've had cheap debt for a while now since 2008), then what will happen when debt becomes more expensive? People will have to shift their money from spending to pay off their debts instead. This leads to less consumption, which leads to less in business profits, which leads to fewer jobs, which leads to less spending etc. (it's a spiral downwards -- watch this good video on [how the economy works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHe0bXAIuk0&t=18s)). The unwinding of the credit cycle leads to recessions. This is why rising interest rates usually predate recessions. [Check out this chart and look at how a rise in the Fed Funds rate has predated the past 2 recessions.](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FEDFUNDS)\n\nBond yields are rising because investors expect inflation. More inflation means that you require a higher rate of return if you're going to give the government your money. But it also means credit costs more. As these yields rose, the stock market was acting like nothing was happening. Then, on Friday we got an economic report saying that wages rose by much more than expected. This was a clear signal for more-than-anticipated inflation. As a result, the stock market had to price in what they believe was the Federal Reserve raising rates faster than anticipated. Couple that with the insanity that has been the stock market (it hasn't fallen substantially since Brexit), and you get a recipe for disaster.\n\nFriday was a nasty sell-off and the general consensus is that we're nearing a recession (they usually happen every 7-10 years historically). Couple that with people looking to take profits from all the money that was made in the past few months/years... You have many more people looking to sell than to buy. [According to the CAPE P/E ratio, you can see where stocks are in terms of historical value.](http://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe/) This is the second most overbought stock market, more than the Great Depression. The only rival market is the DotCom stock market boom of the 90s and into 2000/01. Today was just a continuation of reality sinking in for traders and the stock market in general.\n\nThings to watch going forward are the following:\n\n1) Economic reports suggesting rising inflation. If they do suggest inflation, then yields will rise higher, causing further increases to the cost of credit. This should precipitate more stock selling and downward pressure.\n\n2) The government debt ceiling and a government shutdown in March. This is by far the biggest problem going forwards. If Trump cannot get the Democrats to raise the debt ceiling (or if the Dems use the debt ceiling to force the Republicans for concessions), we may be in for a very wild ride. If for some reason, the US defaults on its debt (it doesn't make payments to its debtors on time), it would precipitate the biggest crisis known to man in modern economic history. The USA would become a more modern-day example of Greece. Yields would skyrocket, the US Dollar would collapse and it'd be a disaster. A true clusterfuck of epic proportions. It would be the collapse of the USA as the world's superpower that we know it to be today.\n\n3) Does the Fed raise rates or keep them where they are? If they don't raise rates, they may let inflation get out of hand (interest rates would explode up like in the late 70s/early 80s) and it would slow down the economy. If they do raise rates, they would slow down the economy anyways. It's a catch 22. As I said earlier, the Fed kicked the can down the road in 2008.
