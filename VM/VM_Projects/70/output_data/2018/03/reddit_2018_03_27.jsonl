Sure, the iPhone was beautiful from a hardware perspective, but what really made it was iOS, and later adding the app store. Only a company good at software could have done it successfully which was not BlackBerry's competitive advantage. When telcos eventually caught up with their data networks, and iOS and Android became more secure, blackberry had nothing left.\n\nThe car companies of yesterday are blackberry, sure they have technology in them, but I believe that software will be such a huge competitive advantage in the future, a company that is really a software company that also sells cars will be in a much better place for electrification, self driving, and IoT.
