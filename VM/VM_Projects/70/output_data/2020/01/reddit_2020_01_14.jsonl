Service disruptions due to bad weather and accidents are understood (if disliked) features of existing transportation systems.\n\nTesla's MaaS vehicles don't have to be level 5 capable, if the vehicle can keep the passengers safe (decrease speed, pull over) in the increasingly rare edge conditions that it doesn't understand how to handle.

Today, many of the worst driving conditions that human drivers subject themselves to are not, in any empirical sense, logical or safe conditions to be driving in.\n\nThick fog, Road Icing, Whiteout snowstorms, zero visibility heavy rain, all these are conditions that human drivers end up in because of a combination of insufficient planning, incomplete understanding of the road conditions along their route, and the natural human tenancy towards over-valuing sunk costs (not wanting to stop or turn around until conditions are already terrible).
