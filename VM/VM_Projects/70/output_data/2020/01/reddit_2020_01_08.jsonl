The aircraft, an Airbus A300, was destroyed and all 290 people on board, including 66 children, were killed. The jet was hit while flying over Iran's territorial waters in the Persian Gulf, along the flight's usual route, shortly after departing Bandar Abbas International Airport, the flight's stopover location. Vincennes had entered Iranian territory after one of its helicopters drew warning fire from Iranian speedboats operating within Iranian territorial limits.The reason for the shootdown has been disputed between the governments of the two countries.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/stocks/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": ["pm"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.08511854708194733}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.08511854708194733}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.09434082359075546}, {"body": "The US took down a passenger jet during the Reagan Administration.
