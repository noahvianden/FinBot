Now, after hours of browsing this subreddit, I've decided which earning stocks will give free tendies next week.\n\n**GOOGLe** is prolly the hardest one to predict. It has been tumbling for a few days now and monday it'll probably fall even harder so it's a cheap buy. Even if the earnings fall flat it'll quickly recover anyways because it's fuckin' google.\n\n**DISney** has also been tumbling a bit and will MOON with earnings. They had lots of great Star Wars shit (Mandalorian, themepark...) and disney + will do great cuz it just will. Don't bet against the mouse.\n\n**ATVIsion Blizzard** will MOON the hardest of 'em all. They're cheap right now and last year was gr8. They keep selling shit and Classic is a thing. They had lots of shit like Hong Kong and now with their newest game being a huge flop which drives the stock down but guess what? Earnings don't give a shit about that! Everyone's busy jerking off because Blizzard made another 69 billion from their cash shop.\n\nSource: am 140 IQ autist", "id": "exmmn3", "created_utc": 1580639476.0, "score": 165, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 76, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 106, "replies": [{"body": "All in calls.", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "For real \n\nThey just [finished the hospital](https://twitter.com/HuXijin_GT/status/1223946791059513347) \n\nWinnie plans to do a massive [not-QE](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-01/china-vows-financial-stability-as-markets-prepare-for-selloff)\n\nThe inflection point in infected cases should come the next week given the 14 day incubation period and quarantine measures worldwide.\n\nNo new shocking news have came out recently, all is priced in.\n\nEDIT:\n\nI almost forgot: WSB predicts a market crash\n\nEDIT2:\n\n[Told ya](https://i.redd.it/9s2yqfjuuuf41.png)", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "Holy shit, they built a hospital in 10 days?!
