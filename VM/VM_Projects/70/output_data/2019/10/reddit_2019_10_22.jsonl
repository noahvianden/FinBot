{"title": "Macro strategies: It\u2019s not corruption if they tell you, aka short CLOs, long US housing", "selftext": "Listen up you lazy bastards, I\u2019m here to listen to long boring conversations about financial markets that none of you are willing to suffer through so that you can bring home valuable tendies.\n\nVideo is here, 42 views at the time of posting, fresh off the press: https://youtu.be/iZd66xTHOTk\n\nThe one you want to pay attention to is the blond one, she\u2019s outlining how she helped create ~0.5% of all outstanding CLOs. What are CLOs? She explains it in the video, except she really doesn\u2019t. She\u2019s afraid of calling them by their name, collateralized loan obligations, because she\u2019s afraid of being accused of creating CDOs (collateralized debt obligations, the debt vehicles that powered the 08 crisis).\n\nNow why am I telling you all this? This lady has worked in Goldman\u2019s risky loan business for basically 30 years, and she\u2019s just helped create part of the environment that will fuel the next recession by signing off on all of those CLOs. She admits just a few weeks ago that she changed jobs and is now working with a company that is leveraging her abilities to help finance purchasing 33 houses *a day.* The are expecting other financial institutions (internationally) to get into the US house renting business on their quest for yield. However that\u2019s not the only reason it\u2019s a good investment.\n\nThey say that the majority of BBB rated bond companies are \u201cself inflicted\u201d meaning that \u201coh those companies aren\u2019t *actually* risky, they just want to *look* risky.\u201d These companies are taking on massive amounts of debt for M&As (acquisitions) in order to increase revenue expectations to increase stock prices so management at the top can cash out.\n\nThis woman clearly outlines how not only has she helped create the issues that will cause stock prices to tank, they are also expecting the government to bail out these companies, increasing inflation. So what better time for her to get into a business that spends all of their leverage on a hedge against inflation after you\u2019ve helped create the scenario that will trigger vast inflation?\n\nTLDR: woman in video creates as many CLOs as possible to create corporations that are \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d with the expectation that they will be bailed out by the US govt at the expense of increased inflation, then joins hedge fund that intends to buy 33 houses a day as a hedge against inflation that she helped create.", "id": "dlbqui", "created_utc": 1571713645.0, "score": 77, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 73, "comments": [{"body": "Just tell me what tickers and strikes please.

First, CLOs do not hold bonds; it\u2019s only loans. This is a definitive statement. If a CLO held a bond then a bank could not buy a CLO because of the Volcker rule.  Next, the underlying loans in a CLO are B/Ba. The average WARF is around 2900.  To be clear, I was talking about the credit risk of the underlying not the ratings of the individual tranches. \n\n\nFinally and a big WTF, B/Ba is speculative grade dude.
