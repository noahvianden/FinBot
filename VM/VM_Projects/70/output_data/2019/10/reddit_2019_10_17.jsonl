{"title": "The case for Dividend Growth Investing", "selftext": "Hello everyone, \n\nI am a dividend growth investor, and I wanted to offer my perspective on dividend growth stocks and dividend (growth) investing as a strategy. \n\nI know many of you will have seen contrasting videos from Ben Felix and PPCIan on youtube on this topic. My purpose for posting is that I want to spark a broad discussion of the strategy and on dividends in general. \n\nIn my view, it\u2019s a truly incredible strategy. \n\nFor some context, I began trading awhile back, just about breaking even overall. When I started to invest in blue chip dividends stocks geared towards strong free cash flow and dividend growth, I started to see some growth in my portfolio, and that growth will continue whether the market dips or rises. \n \nIf the market rises, obviously share price will increase and I\u2019m still collecting dividends. With DRIP (dividend reinvestment plan), I gain fractional shares and eventually full shares of the companies I own. By investing for ownership of the company (very long term) your wealth will snowball over time. \n\nIf the market falls, you\u2019ll appear to lose money on the share price, but it\u2019s actually a blessing in disguise. When the market falls, most blue chip stocks go on sale and trade at more favorable valuations. Additionally, since the market price is cheaper, you\u2019ll accumulate shares quicker using dividend reinvestment. It\u2019s automated dollar cost averaging. When the market becomes more bullish, the value of your shares will increase rapidly on top of the dividend income you\u2019re receiving steadily. \n\nThe only situation where you\u2019re selling is when a company you own cuts it\u2019s dividend or eliminates it entirely. If you keep holding for decades, your wealth will compound at a rapid rate. The more time you are invested, the more wealth you will create. \n\nBy investing in companies with strong balance sheets, free cash flow and dividend growth, you can create enormous wealth. By doing solid dd and fundamental analysis, you\u2019ll be investing in great companies at favorable valuations. Additionally, dividend increases signal that management is confident in the business and confident that they\u2019ll be able to maintain a higher payout. \n\nSome things you should avoid are companies with yield traps (companies with high dividend yields to keep investors roped in), companies with high payout ratios (I personally like to avoid companies with over 75% payout ratio) and companies that take on a lot of debt (hurts free cash flow). \n\nThe best part is that you never have to sell the shares that you own. You can live off your dividends in retirement AND pass ownership onto your kids. \n\nThe passive income generated by dividends is life changing. The process requires discipline and it\u2019s not sexy \u2014 time matters and it\u2019s a key component.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in learning more about this strategy, please head over to r/dividends or r/dividend_investing to learn more and check out PPCIan on YouTube.
