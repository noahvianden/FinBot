In general I always try my best to manage against downside risk and don\u2019t mind actively trading and even holding cash when I think it makes sense. In Sept, I was feeling bearish based on exploding debt everywhere among other things I was hearing/reading so once I lost about 10% from where I was at in early Oct and the market seemed to be red way more than green. I decided to pull out and wait to see what happened. After Powell\u2019s pivot in Jan, I thought it was a good time to jump back in. Bought again on Jan 3. Invested a lot in $AAPL among other individual stocks/etfs I liked and that I thought were undervalued. In April, I had gained about 35%+ and wanted a way to lock in those gains as more data points started pointing to an approaching decline and rate cut talks started coming. I knew gold had been suppressed since 2011 and was trading basically sideways. I figured now is the time to enter PMs and bought $GOLD, $GLD and $SLV. Figuring the worst that would happen is staying roughly even as I didn\u2019t see a probable way that it would erase my gains. By mid may, I realized that my call was right and I started to buy call options and I\u2019ve been buying calls about a month or two out since then.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "JNUG bro.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1393461674451828}, {"body": "I see, my mistake there was fear.

And remember the market tends to be bullish way more than bearish. However, this might be the time where bears are right. Also, it\u2019s incredibly difficult but try not to make emotional decisions.
