{"title": "I'm that guy that tracked his progress selling/writing options", "selftext": "Some of you might remember this post haha: https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/c1yqct/i_track_my_progress_sellingwriting_options/\n\n\nwww.thetagang.com\n\nTheta Gang podcast on SPOTIFY: https://open.spotify.com/show/5bWW20PmxgOT95zR1UMZ11?si=2PfoKs4PSqCl_Cbltb1OXg\n\nTheta Gang on APPLE PODCASTS: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/theta-gang/id1474557787?mt=2&app=itunes\n\nPodcast Layout\n\n1. Intro\n\n2. Weekly Picks\n\n3. Website updates\n\n4. Today's Topic (next one is on interest rates recording today!)\n\n5. Funny stuff (yolo options bets, etc.)\n\n6. Outro\n\nSo here is a small progress update on everything that I've learned and so forth:\n\n1.  Selling/Writing options is helluva less stressful and easier to manage when you're at work\n\n2. If you get your mindset off of making income, but rather trading for fun it's takes a lot of the emotional side of trading out\n\n3.  Podcasts are fun, and there aren't a lot of people starting them for finance, probably because people are afraid of making bad predictions, but fuck it let me be the scapegoat haha\n\n4.  Podcasts are also a lot of hard work LOL.\n\n5.  There's a lack of transparency of these elite traders making tons of money, which I guess I mean that's also why some people charge money to be in the groups.  Although I'm not elite, my trades are free to view; even my open ones!\n\n6.  Selling spreads instead of naked options has saved me thousands of dollars;  I am not a huge fan of selling naked if you're not okay with losing the money you're playing with.  I had to be real with myself and yeah I guess kinda do care if I lost most of my trading portfolio\n\n7.  Feedback is super important!  I listen to all my feedback and even have a segment on my show where I implement features directly from feedback and shout one of my users out\n\n8. Consistency is key!  On both developing and trading.  I make it a mission for myself to work on the website every night every week as well as trade as frequently as I can.  Having the sense of community helps me be a better software engineer and a better trader.  So thank you for everyone for that\n\n9.  MOST IMPORTANT: having fun.  i'm doing this all for fun which I think helps me be consistent and motivated.  I don't have a big corporation telling me what to do, I don't have investors to impress, and I sure as hell don't care about people watching me lose/gain money.\n\nThank you from the bottom of my heart for reading; if you have any questions, just like last time, I'll answer any of them\n\nHappy Sunday,\nJoonie", "id": "cp2uge", "created_utc": 1565559719.0, "score": 165, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 70, "comments": [{"body": "If you're trading spreads, the golden rule is credit spreads when IV is high, debit when low.
