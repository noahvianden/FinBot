Mass production was supposed to bring efficiencies allowing them to profit. If you are just chasing market share, that\u2019s a fools errand.\n\nAmazon's IPO was in May 1997.  Amazon was not consistently profitable until Q2 of 2015, roughly 18 years later: [https://www.vox.com/2018/2/1/16961598/amazon-jeff-bezos-record-profit-11-quarter-q4-2017-earnings](https://www.vox.com/2018/2/1/16961598/amazon-jeff-bezos-record-profit-11-quarter-q4-2017-earnings).\n\nDuring that two decades, many people scoffed at Amazon, saying the company would never succeed, because they were in a low-margin business (retail) and would surely be crushed by established retail players who already had sophisticated logistics networks, profits to plough into building online sales, and marketshare power to drive prices so low that no one else could compete (Walmart).  Largely ignored was Amazon's R&D into logistics infrastructure: the systems that would ultimately power its business and be sold to others.  How many people could have seen in 2002 or even 2006 what AWS would become?  Very few.  Many more people continued to harp on the \"low margin\" \"no profit\" and \"competition will crush them\" fallbacks.  **Many of my own friends and  relatives dismissed Amazon as a scam and a fraud upon the world.**\n\nThe focus that some people place on profits, profits, profits, may cause them to lose sight of the bigger long-term picture.  This was true of Amazon.  It could be true of Tesla as well.  \n\n\n>When does the cycle break?\n\nNobody knows.  If anyone actually knew, TSLA would likely be trading much higher, or much lower, than it is today.  Many Redditors like to think they know, or can divine the outcome, but that's just not possible.\n\nI've reached the conclusion that most debate around TSLA at the retail level is pointless.\n\nPeople whose personalities predispose them to need *certainty*, will continue to harp on Tesla's lack of current profits and uncertain prospect of any near-term profits.  Nothing will convince them that Tesla could eventually be profitable, at some undetermined point in the future, and on a scale different from traditional auto manufacturers.  The tired refrain over the past 9 years has been \"But what if XYZ bad thing happens and JKL never happens? \"\n\nPeople whose personalities predispose them to risk taking and entrepreneurship will continue to harp on Tesla's possibilities, and will continue to *hope* that vertical integration of supply chain, manufacturing, and technology will give the company a long-term chance at upending the conventional wisdom that cars are a static, low-margin business.  They will continue to hope that the infrastructure Tesla is building now, will pay dividends in future.\n\nTSLA is essentially a proxy battle between personalities who need certainty and personalities who embrace risk.  It's really that simple.", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "Since (and including) 2003, Amazon made money in all but 2 years. That\u2019s a profit in 14 out of 16 years.

In other words, the annual losses were small compared to the profits in years in which it was profitable. It lost all of $39 million in 2012 and $241 million in 2014.

On a quarterly basis, it has recorded exactly four quarterly profits, with the rest of them being losses. \n\nAnyone who bothers to spend 5 minutes researching the P/L of Amazon and Tesla over the last ~two decades will see that the whole premise of your post (Amazon having inconsistent profitability) is completely and utterly incorrect.\n\nEdit: this revisionist financial history drives me absolutely insane. The question for amazon wasn\u2019t whether it could make a profit (it was making a profit in more years than it wasn\u2019t), but rather whether that profit was or could be large enough to justify its valuation. \n\nAfter looking at the income statements for Amazon and Tesla, I\u2019d also recommend going to the cash flow statement and looking at cash flow from financing. You\u2019ll notice some differences between Amazon and Tesla, namely that over the last 16ish years, Amazon has grown to where it is today without excessive debt and equity issuance. That is not true of Tesla.", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": ">Anyone who bothers to spend 5 minutes researching the P/L of Amazon and Tesla over the last \\~two decades will see that the whole premise of your post (Amazon having inconsistent profitability) is completely and utterly incorrect.\n\nI have not watched Amazon or AMZN stock much at all over the past 20 years.  I am actually not very interested in tech stocks at all, with TSLA being somewhat of an aberration (I started following Tesla about 10 years ago because of the automotive aspect, not the FSD/Energy business).  \n\nI looked at a chart with more data than the one Vox provided: [https://qz.com/1196256/it-took-amazon-amzn-14-years-to-make-as-much-net-profit-as-it-did-in-the-fourth-quarter-of-2017/](https://qz.com/1196256/it-took-amazon-amzn-14-years-to-make-as-much-net-profit-as-it-did-in-the-fourth-quarter-of-2017/).   It is a fair point that Amazon had yearly profits, but  Amazon's quarterly net profits never exceeded 0.5B $US from 1997 until 2015, and it looks like most of the quarterly profits were under 250M/quarter.   In the context of revenue growth, this was so low as to appear almost nonexistent.  \n\nThis was as Amazon's revenue grew from essentially nill in 1997 to 110 Billion in 2015, while profits remained essentially flat and close to 0.  [https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-revenue-vs-profit-2016-1](https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-revenue-vs-profit-2016-1).  From a general big picture perspective, it \"appears\" that Amazon could not grow profits, and that its miniscule profits as % of revenue kept shrinking and shrinking (heading towards zero % practically) as revenues grew higher and higher and profits did not increase through 2015.  To anyone not aware of what Amazon was building in terms of AWS, technology, and other infrastructure, this looks really, really bad.  This appears to be part of the reason everyone from my relatives to Paulos Santos was saying that Amazon was some kind of bubble (in Santos' case) or scam (many of my relatives genuinely believed that Bezos is/was a fraud and were open about their negative opinion of his business).\n\nI also don't think any of this changes any of what I'm saying about the psychology of people who are Bullish vs. Bearish on TSLA. \n\nAlmost to a fault, among people I know in real life, people who are pro-Tesla are entrepreneurial, early adopters, and risk takers.  They hope that somehow, Elon Musk and his team will make things work, despite the high capital costs of manufacturing and the amount of debt on Tesla's books.   Yes, this is a leap of faith.  A big leap of faith.\n\nPeople I know in real life who are anti-Tesla generally work in steady jobs, often numbers-based occupations like accounting, and usually avoid risk.  They nitpick every little thing that does or could go wrong with Tesla, ranging from concern about demand, to quality, to service, to competitors, government regulations on FSD, dilution, debt., etc. etc. etc.  \n\nI get why many of the anti-Tesla people can't stand the fans for whom Elon can do no wrong.  The Steve Jobs groupies annoyed the hell out of me in the 90's and 00's.  But the anti-Tesla crowd should know that the totality of all their incessant complaining about Tesla being overvalued and having no chance of success starts to sound like whining, or worse, shrill nagging.
