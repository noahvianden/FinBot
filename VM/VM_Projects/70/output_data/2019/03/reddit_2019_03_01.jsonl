He belatedly realized the political landscape had changed, and decided he was unwilling to engage further. He did not want to deal with it or be embarrassed. Full stop.\n\nHe still accredits it to the changing political landscape rather than anything else.  AoC is a result of that change, but not the cause.  I guess it was technically Crony Capitalism, because they were unfairly given a tax cut that did not affect everyone equally.  However, crony capitalism is always present in our world, it just has to be limited to having benefits that pay for the cost.  \n\nAn example is the older tax deduction for the purchase of solar panels.  The solar section in the market was unequally favored by a tax deduction that wasn't applied across the entire energy sector.  This allowed solar companies to fare better than other energy production companies, because they were forced to be competitive with the market via political means.  However, it was justified, because we saw a large uptick in solar power production and that enabled less carbon output and could help curb the human factor (whatever that may be) from affecting our climate.\n\nThe Amazon tax credit did benefit the company while also taking away potential revenue from the city and the public.  However, what's the cost of not doing it?  While I'm sure NYC will be fine without Amazon, 25,000 jobs at average $150k a piece is a ton of money.  It also brings gentrification into that area which, from studies by the Philadelphia Treasury Department, benefits every resident without causing them to be displaced.  They lost tax revenue, because of this.  \n\nYes, it gave them an unfair advantage, but that's business.  You do business deals to mutually benefit both sides.  Just because concessions are made, doesn't mean that it's a bad deal.  I saw this happen with a small ski hill in NJ.  Mountain Creek was wayyy behind on their water bill.  The made a deal with the city to use their public water for snowmaking purposes.  Snowmaking uses a TON of water.  Because they gave the city most of it's tax revenue, they made concessions to wipe the water bill and keep operating.  The ski hill still runs, the city still collects tax, the local residents property value remains high, and people keep their jobs.  NYC is a huge hub that doesn't rely on a single company to make their tax revenue, but the same logic applies.  They would have massively benefited from Amazon being there.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "I think in your first argument with the tax deduction for solar panels, the fact that it benefits a whole *industry* and not a single company is a crucial point.\n\nBut regardless I don't necessarily disagree with any of your points, my only view on it as a NYC resident was that I feel our transportation systems were already stretched too thin.\n ", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.48513275384902954}], "tickers": ["amzn"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.13510781526565552}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.15070141851902008}, {"body": "I would love to put my penis in her anus she prob loves that shit ", "score": -9, "replies": [{"body": "Dude", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "What she is a grown ass woman wtf like I put my penis in woman and men anus holes I'm a power bisexual top ", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Ya, see these are not normal things that people say.
