They have not mastered highway driving, that's absurd, it's the vast majority of what Tesla spends their energy on, they're miles ahead of Waymo/Cruise and they haven't mastered it either.\nWaymo/Cruise have made incredibly detailed maps of the city streets (HD Maps).

If/when waymo/cruise truly go live they have pigeon holed themselves into a specific market (albeit a large one) through their expensive (lidar) approach, and focus on inner city taxi service. Tesla has taken a vastly more difficult route, using much cheaper sensors. This has allowed them to currently offer a very compelling very high margin product to current consumers (autopilot), but also set themselves up to be the only company with fully autonomous cars that work everywhere. No one else is really even trying. They're all purposefully geofencing themselves and using very expensive lidar to try and get to the finish line faster. I don't think it's likely to work out well for them because lidar has too many limitations wrt weather. So I don't see how they can get market penetration when the cars only work when it's nice and sunny - but maybe I'm underestimating them.
