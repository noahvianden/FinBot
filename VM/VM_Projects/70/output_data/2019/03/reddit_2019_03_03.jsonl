This man is running a company that lands rockets backwards and just successfully launched another spacecraft in partnership with NASA. He was also able to drum up 400k reservations for a vehicle that people haven't even seen in person with no advertising. He's accomplished 20% margins on a battery powered cars despite being told it was impossible. Tell me, is this a man you would like to bet against with the downside loss being unlimited? This is what I'll never understand about short sellers and TSLA.Q. There's literally thousands of other positions that are far more profitable than being short Tesla.\n\nI fail to see what any of this has to do with Tesla Model 3 sales.\n\nAnd yes, I would like to bet against a known liar whose company's US car sales just dropped 80%. A lot of people made a lot of money betting on Elon Musk's big announcement being negative for the stock on friday. From now until the end of year I'm going to scale into longer term puts every time Tesla pops.\n\nIt's also pretty funny how you've bought into the Tesla hype hook line and sinker. No advertising? Then what the fuck is that marketing budget? 500k reservations? How many actual sales did that translate into?
