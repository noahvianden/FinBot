{"title": "A Detailed Breakdown of Warren Buffet's Portfolio for 2020", "selftext": "I made this video looking at the top holdings in Warren Buffett's portfolio, analyzing why he invested in them and if they have been a good investment so far. I don't want to force anyone to watch it so I will give a summary for each stock. If you do choose to watch the video and want to give feedback, it would be appreciated!  \n\n\n[https://youtu.be/JM5zwSBi790](https://youtu.be/JM5zwSBi790)  \n\n\n **Apple - 25.96% ($55,732,400,000)** \n\n>He claims that his main reasons for investing are because of their amazing products, brand, and most important brand loyalty. Warren recognizes the strength of this brand and people\u2019s willingness to pay more for Apple products. In addition to loving the company, warren has also gotten a very good price for the company. With regard to other tech companies, Apple is considered much safer and has shown consistent returns. \n\n**Bank of America - 12.60% ($27,047,843,000)** \n\n> In the wake of the financial crisis of 2008 the banks weren\u2019t in great shape. Ever since, Warren has been purchasing shares of BAC and other companies in the financial sector. His main reasons for doing so have been their relatively low price tags, low P/E ratios, and fair dividends. In 2019 alone, Buffett added almost 1 billion shares to his position in Q2 of 2019, showing that he still thinks the stock is trading below what he believes the company is worth. \n\n **Coca-Cola - 10.14% ($21,776,000,000)** \n\n>Coca-Cola is a company that needs no explanation. It is arguably one of Warren Buffett's greatest investments, being so fond of the stock he has even said that he never has and never will sell a share of Coca-Cola. His reasons for investing in Coca-Cola are very similar to his reasoning for investing in Apple, knowing that customers are willing to pay more because of just how strong the brand loyalty is. He started investing in Coca-Cola soon after the stock market crash of 1987, buying it for about the same price as it pays out in dividends each year now. Berkshire is currently Coca-Cola\u2019s largest shareholder with 9.4% of its outstanding shares, worth close to $22 billion and making up 10.14% of Warren\u2019s Portfolio \n\n **Wells Fargo - 8.89% ($ 19,084,935,000)** \n\n> Wells Fargo is a banking, investing, credit, and financial services company. His reasoning for owning this stock is very similar to why he owns Bank of America stock. Despite the bank being involved in a series of scandals since 2016, Buffett doesn\u2019t seem to mind. His main focus is that Wells Fargo was involved in all these problems, but despite this, they aren\u2019t losing any customers to speak of. This customer loyalty is one of the reasons why Buffett currently has $19 billion dollars invested in Wells Fargo, making up 8.89% of his portfolio. \n\n **American Express - 8.35% ($17,932,512,000)** \n\n> American Express is a credit card and charge company and has always been a target for Warren whenever the markets take a dip and everyone else is fearful. That\u2019s why he gets such great entry prices on his investments. Since picking up his initial stake in 1963, he has since grown his position to close to $18 billion, making up 8.35% of his portfolio. When you consider that American Express has seen a 12.5% average annual return over the past quarter-century, it\u2019s no wonder he is such a big fan of this company. \n\n **Kraft Heinz - 4.24% ($9,096,609,000)** \n\n> If there is any investment that Warren Buffett regrets, it\u2019s Kraft Heinz, his sixth largest investment. In 2018, Berkshire Hathaway recorded a $3 billion non-cash loss, that Buffett said arised \u201calmost entirely from their equity interest in Kraft Heinz\u201d. Kraft's shares have lost 14.7% on an annualized total return basis since Sept. 30, 2015. That includes a 23% plunge in 2019. \n\n **US Bank Corp, JP Morgan Chase, Moody's, Goldman Sachs, and the Bank of New York Mellon** All you really need to know is that he has been buying shares every time the prices crash and since 2008 he has been increasing his position in almost every financial stock. \n\n **Delta Air Lines - 1.90% ($4,084,442,000)** \n\n> Buffett first picked up shares of Delta Air Lines in the third quarter of 2016. Recently raising his stake in Delta by 8% in Q1 of 2019, making Berkshire Hathaway the largest Delta shareholder, owning 10.9% of outstanding shares. \n\n**Southwest Airlines - 1.35% ($2,897,595,000)** \n\n>Like Delta, this is another airline that Buffett picked up in late 2016.The discount carrier is beloved by its customers and employees alike, typically finding itself near the top of \"Best Airline\" and \"Best Places to Work For\" lists. So it has a safe reputation and as an investment, it has performed decently within the Berkshire fold, generating an annualized total return of 16.1% since Aug. 31, 2016.", "id": "e9gwkg", "created_utc": 1576115310.0, "score": 337, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 67, "comments": [{"body": "I've been pretty disappointed with BRK.B this year.  \n\nHope 2020 is a better year for the Oracle.", "score": 59, "replies": [{"body": "Just have to hold the line and wait, Berkshire Hathaway is constructed to be a bulletproof and strong company for the foreseeable future, as long as you're willing to buy into their investment philosophy you'll be fine", "score": 13, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.24662494659423828}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 44, "replies": [{"body": "He is waiting for the crash when cash becomes oxygen", "score": 18, "replies": [{"body": "He recently tried to take over a big data company, but failed.

This is a huge increase from the $23 billion in cash Berkshire was holding on to in 2009. Now because of some insurance companies that Berkshire owns, they are required to keep a certain amount of cash on hand, but the amount that Berkshire has been putting away has led a lot of people to speculate that he is expecting a crash or that he is no longer the same great investor he always was.\n\n**General Motors - 1.26% ($2,708,669,000)**\n\n>Warren Buffett first took a stake in **General Motors**, the world's fourth-largest auto manufacturer by production, in early 2012. He most recently upped Berkshire Hathaway's holdings in the fourth quarter of 2018, when he increased his position by 37%. However, like Kraft Heinz, this is also one of the more disappointing investments for Warren and Berkshire Hathaway. Including dividends, General Motors has returned a disappointing 81% since March 2012 - roughly half the market\u2019s total return in that time.\n\n**Others - 12.82% ($27,522,702,000)**\n\n>About 12.82% of Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s portfolio is invested in small positions in a wide variety of companies.
