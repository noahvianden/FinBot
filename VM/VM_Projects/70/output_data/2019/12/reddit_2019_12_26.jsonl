Let\u2019s assume that all 5 million of those customers end up being paid Prime members \u2014 that\u2019s $595 million in annual run rate recurring sales assuming the service\u2019s $119 annual fee. Not too shabby of a recurring revenue stream, which could go onto be higher as Prime members spend throughout the Amazon ecosystem. It could also help Amazon easily fund its ambitious new investments in same-day delivery and dare we day, electric autos (see recent Rivian investment).", "id": "efvw7l", "created_utc": 1577369817.0, "score": 264, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 64, "comments": [{"body": "work intelligent mighty plate entertain ten lavish square materialistic elastic\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)*", "score": 224, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 84, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah that is probably likely for a lot of them.

Now I have a brand new a7 sony camera; next I order an a7iii when it arrives I replace it with the new a7. Old women who have to process 45 items an hour cant tell the difference between an a7 and an a7iii. Boom Amazon lost 2.5k. Someone buys a nvidia graphics card and replaces it with an old model boom amazon is out 2k.  Someone buys a gaming computer opens it up and removes the graphics card boom amazon is out 1k. This happens all day long everyday. THen you have just dirty ass ppl who will buy 5 bikinis for their vacation, wear all 5 return all 5 dirty bikinis with sand and stains and get full refunds. Items under 20 bucks if you call and say it came damaged they will send a new one without even wanting to check if the first one was damaged. Boom send 1 back and you got it for free. As long as at least 70 percent if the item is returned they get a full refund. guess what? I buy an surface pro, I keep the pen and keyboard and sell it on ebay I return the tab and get a full refund. It is literally that easy and it happens all day long every day. We process 20k return items a day for Canada and we have a parking lot full of returns. I know people who actually work with me and just keep trading up. We do not even allow associates to process airpods anymore because ppl were buying the knock offs and returning fake ones in the apple packaging this went on for months. We get 1k undelivered every day. We send it; it comes back. All amazon brand is destroyed, and all edibles are automatically destroyed the rest if goes back. I could go on for days man.

I finally received a fully functional one on the fourth go, by when one of the parcels that had been lost was finally delivered too.

No difference.  Only the groups of fraudsters are investigated. Even then we are months behind. I do not care anymore it makes no difference.
