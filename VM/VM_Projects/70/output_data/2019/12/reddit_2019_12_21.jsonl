{"title": "Battery Day Speculation", "selftext": "My guess: Tesla is ready to deploy a new battery production process based on the maxwell DBE tech and achieve both a 20% energy density improvement along with a \\~25% battery cost improvement. They will make good on their previous promise to demonstrate production at around $90 per kwh at the pack level (\\~$70 at the cell level). This will be in keeping with several updates to the S/X line (120kwh ultra-LR trim) as well as model 3 (100kwh trim).\n\nAs in investor, this will be a huge boon as both demand and margins will increase substantially. This is because the perceived value of added range is about 5X higher than the cost of the cells to provide it. For example, a 20kwh upgrade will only cost $1400 in additional cells with the new production process, but will likely be able to command a \\~$7000 premium (as evidenced by the cost gap between SR and LR trims for the same difference in battery capacity). This also gives Tesla the flexibility to reduce prices slightly on certain models to increase demand, while still gradually lifting gross margins across the portfolio. In short, cheaper batteries is good for customers, good for demand, and good for margins. Given the range deficit already demonstrated by competing automakers, this will really hit that point even harder. Think about this; With a 120kwh option at only slighter higher ASP than today's model S (\\~$85k), the model S 120D will have more than DOUBLE the range of the Taycan, while costing 20% less.\n\nMy guess on future trims, ranges, and MSRPs:\n\nModel S:\n\n100D - 380mi - $75K (margin roughly at parity with today's S100D despite a $5k discount to the consumer)\n\n120D - 450mi - $85K (+$8k margin over the 100D)\n\n120D(P) - software upgraded 120D with sportier acceleration, track mode? (likely a $5k OTA option)\n\nP120D - 425mi - $100K (with plaid powertrain. 0-60 around 2.2s)\n\nModel X:\n\n100D - 335mi - $80K (margin roughly at parity with today's X100D despite a $5k discount to the consumer)\n\n120D - 400mi - $90K (+$8k margin over the 100D)\n\nP120D - 375mi - $100K\n\nModel 3:\n\nBase (62kwh) - 290mi - $37,500  (margin roughly at parity with today's SR+ despite a $2.5k discount to the consumer)\n\nAWD (74kwh) - 320mi - $47,500 (margin improved by \\~$1000 compared to today's AWD, despite $1500 discount)\n\nAWD(P) - software upgraded AWD with sportier acceleration, track mode? (likely a $2.5k OTA option)\n\nPerformance (100kwh) - 420mi - $59,000 (0-60 in the 2.8s range, margin improved by $2-$3k compared to today's performance model 3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnalysis leading me to this conclusion:\n\nRecent [rumors](https://twitter.com/greentheonly/status/1208160375461556224?s=21) point to a 100kwh model 3 trim becoming available soon. To fit 100kwh of batteries in the same footprint as the current 78kwh battery, the density would need to improve by about 20%.\n\nModel 3 2170 cells are currently at 250wh/kg. Maxwell was touting a proven density of 300wh/kg, exactly a 20% improvement over current-gen 2170 cells.\n\nEnergy density improvements are likely to map about 1:1 with cost improvements because the cost of the raw materials decreases as density increases. i.e., you get the same battery capacity with fewer cells, so cost and density are highly correlated. However, cost savings are likely even higher due to manufacturing improvements specific to the DBE process itself (improved yield rates, faster cycle times, tighter tolerances). This is why I estimate 25% cost improvement on cells; 20% due to the density improvement and cost of raw materials, and an additional 5% due to the manufacturing process improvements. This may prove to be fairly conservative; at one point panasonic's giga1 yield rates were rumored to be as low as 85%. Even if above 90% now, improving this to 98% or 99% via DBE would allow an 8-9% cost improvement on its own. In reality, the improvement can be roughly modeled as:\n\nCell improvements {0.75\\*\\[(cell density improvement)+(margin recovery due to vertical integration)+(yield rate improvement)+(manufacturing cost avoidance)\\]} + Pack improvements{0.25\\*\\[(learning rate)+(density improvements)\\]} =\n\n{0.75\\*\\[(15-25%)+(5-10%)+(4-8%)+(2-5%)\\]} + {0.25\\*\\[(8-15%)+(4-10%)\\]} = {0.75\\*\\[26-48%\\]} + {0.25\\*\\[12-25%\\]} = **22.5%-42% expected cost reduction at pack level. This shows over a 20% likely cost reduction at the very least, with the average expected improvement likely closer to 30%.**\n\nAchieving this battery cost target aligns with [comments made](https://cleantechnica.com/2018/06/09/100-kwh-tesla-battery-cells-this-year-100-kwh-tesla-battery-packs-in-2020/) by JB and Elon in several forums (i.e. below $100 per kwh at pack level by 2020)\n\nElon [confirmed](https://ww.electrek.co/2019/11/06/tesla-increase-model-s-x-battery-pack-capacity-plaid-mode-elon-musk/) a larger battery pack would be present in the Plaid config of the model S.\n\nIf you achieve that goal, that will either manifest as lower advertised prices, higher range trims, and increased margins.", "id": "ednejw", "created_utc": 1576915969.0, "score": 108, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "num_comments": 74, "comments": [{"body": "I think it's a safe bet that when they announce it they will announce it at the same time as they are going to implement it, because they don't want people to hold off buying until the technology is released", "score": 50, "replies": [{"body": "I agree.

Scalability, Tesla's batteries are *good enough* these days, they don't really need to become better to make their cars viable. Cost is a bit limiting, but if raw materials is say 80% of manufacturing costs then just developing a way to faster scale battery production is huge. Instead of having Gigafactory 1 producing 30 GWh, having a factory of that size being able to produce 120 GWh for the same cost per kWh would be huge. Reducing cost is nice, but Tesla today mainly just needs more batteries.\n2. Longevity, we kinda already know this one is coming because that is what they mainly focused on in the maxwell dry battery electrode paper. Elon also said their next battery pack starting production in 2020 will be able to power a car for 1 million miles compared to the current battery packs which are designed to last 500,000 miles. Longevity is a huge selling point for EVs and especially with autonomy, if the car is literally driving 24/7 then 500,000 miles will go by fast. An autonomous Semi being able to drive 1 million miles compared to 500,000 will essential be able to make double the profits.\n\nThese two kinda go hand in hand cost, density.
