More importantly, watch which companies are rolling debt so they can make interest payments on what they owe.  There's this little measurement called \"DSCR\" (debt service coverage ratio) that's going to become one of the buzz words on the next market crash.\n\nThere's so much corporate debt riding the line with a triple B rating that when the worm turns, it's going to turn hard.  Literally, the rock and a hard place will be the Fed. legally prohibited from buying corporate debt to sequester on its balance sheet and institutional funds' corporate charter and holdings board rules legally requiring divestment from corporates whose debt falls below the BBB line in the sand.\n\nThere are only two, possibly three things maintaining the Wile E.

I dont know... maybe preventing the next disastrous economic crash is as simple as preventing BBB debt from going down one notch.  It's annoyingly simple minded, but that could be what's going on.\n\n2 - ratings agencies; pulling the same shit they've always pulled:  pay for play... as aided and abetted by \"covlite\".  This is really the trigger that will kick the next crash off in a style not dissimilar from the GFC.  Everyone likes to think we've \"defused the interconnectedness bomb\".  The reality is that the interconnectedness has just shifted and it's shifted because of negative interest rates in at least two of the world's largest economies (maybe three depending on how you answer the question \"if the risk free rate of return is below inflation, is the interest rate effectively negative?\").  The consequence of the \"new interconnectedness\" is that the world has flocked to the US equities market without any sort of hedging.  What happens when all the world's hot money blows up?

Market is sitting just above affordability levels for median income level families in large metros. FOMO investors are done. Recent tax changes make real estate not so great on paper for your average upper middle income families.\n\nIf you ask me there\u2019s a lot of cash that\u2019s sideline right now. Speculative buyers don\u2019t wanna move funds. Builders and Developers don\u2019t want to sell because money is cheap right now (for those qualifying, why sell when the rental market is hot and I\u2019m borrowing for pennies?) The people forced to buy and sell are people who actually need to sell or need to buy.

Just not in the immediate future. The reason why I say hard money borrowers are the ones getting squeezed is that you might not see the rate of price increase to match your interest of 8-12% or even 15%. \n\nThere's nothing to indicate that the housing market is in a bubble because the rate of homes being sold at a fairly normal rate and price is within affordability for median income and above households, especially in large metros. The actual problem is the quality of inventory (mean those that have reasonable return via rental or high turnover with little downtime, and consistent returns). Like I said quality properties aren't being sold because if you're an investor there's nothing out there for you to exchange for. So why take the tax hit? Especially if you're a qualified borrower. For example, I have an offer from First Republic for a 15 year @ 2.8%. If the right thing comes along you better believe I'll take the offer. The problem is I haven't found anything worth wild and I'm not the only person here in the same boat or with the same offer. The market has slowed a little bit because there's a group of speculative buyers that rely on hard money loans that are out of the race. Then you tack on recent tax changes regarding property tax and interest write off, real estate isn't that appealing for those who are just barely bordering in the market for a 2nd home (basically the high-income earners, with little experience in real estate, who can afford that 2nd mortgage, but are too afraid of dealing with rentals or barely have the experience with owning 1 home let alone 2) \n\n**To summarize,** money is cheap to borrow so most investors don't want to sell unless they have to sell, it's more lucrative to refinance to a better deal if you're able. Speculative buyers are missing the aggressive hard money buyers. People that need to buy and need to sell for relocation purposes are the primary market makers at the moment. So it's not like the market is being flooded with inventory. It's that sellers are slowing at a quicker or similar pace as buyers.\n\nIt's a holders market right now. If money was expensive, and holders are getting squeezed like in 2008...yeah that's an indicator that there's an incoming crisis, not to mention people were borrowing up to 125% of home's appraised value.

Honestly, I'm on the sidelines. As soon as I saw the market react, I totally expect this to be a buying op. The virus itself has a lot of similarities to the flu, and it seems very isolated in China right now even though there have been cases outside of China. If the traits are similar, I think the virus will have a tough time spreading in warmer climates and warmer weather. I think the virus is very sensationalized, but not necessarily blown out of proportions. I would use warming temps as a buying opportunity as the sensationalism dies down. \n\nNot to sound like I'm promoting a bad situation as an opportunity to make money\n\nAs for real estate, I don't think real estate will be impacted much though. It's not a buyers market in a lot of metros. There's a clear lack of quality homes and investment properties available. It's a holders markets. What you've bought before is not worth selling because it's not easily replaced. What you've bought now has plateaued and you're unlikely to reap immediate returns. Homes and real estate is valued on a case by case basis. It's not like a stock, so the value doesn't trend up or down rapidly and it's not as liquid. For investment properties, it's not like you buy it for a few months and sell it. Usually, you're looking at a multi-year/5-10 year outlook, if not even longer. So short term news that rattles the equity markets have very little impact on long term investing, particularly in real estate.
