{"title": "A Derivative Trading Method for Consistent Long Term Returns", "selftext": "I [maintain ](https://medium.com/@tylerjewell/a-derivative-trading-method-for-long-term-consistent-market-beating-returns-d0d17aceb9ca)a paper that overviews my trading technique which has yielded 18.1% CAGR over 9 years, and was  >20% prior to making a silly mistake in 2017. The development of the system was done out of necessity in 2010 when I had become ill, but over time has turned into a hobby. As such, as with all hobbyists, it's great to share your efforts for discussion and growth.\n\nI periodically update the paper and publish it for feedback. Over the years, gathering community feedback has helped refine the many techniques within the paper and to also hunt out potential wipe out risk scenarios, especially vega risk, which is not talked about nearly enough! \n\nI don't mind sharing these techniques - I am an open source software advocate, which experiences have ingrained a pay-it-forward sensibility. The intangible benefits of helping others outweighs the risk to any alpha such a strategy may have. \n\nThis is not the first time that this has been shared. Over the years, have discussed the concepts extensively in various options trading forums and with experts, to help de-risk certain concepts. It's been fun to help educate others on how the system works and to see some also learn a new way to generate income. Some of my friends trade this approach.\n\nHappy to address questions. If there are areas of coverage that should be added, I will keep a running list for sections to be drafted for the next time I do a refresh, such as what happened yesterday where I found myself with 3 hours, a great cup of tea, and working through EOY organizing of the trading accounts.", "id": "efi46d", "created_utc": 1577289853.0, "score": 177, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 79, "comments": [{"body": "I work at a hf professionally and I\u2019ll give you a few quick thoughts.

Weekends where there could be so much movement and an inability to make any compensating trades were agonizing in the first year. A few things happened that have lessened the sensitivity to these concerns:\n\n1) Realizing that you can always adjust the risk profile by lessening the number of contracts opened. As the years have gone on and the SPX has risen to significant heights, I have increased my risk tolerance to only opening enough puts so as to be able to absorb a near 60% drop in the SPX before I make my first adjustment to absorb any total wipe out.  Might take some serious losses along the way, but a single day 60% drop would be unheard of in the modern era, especially with the circuit breakers that are in place that were not in place previously.  \n\n\n2) I did have losing positions from being too aggressive in both calls and puts. Having some of those positions go ITM, seeing near term net liquidation value losses of up to 15%, and then learning how to trade out of those situations created a sense of battle hardening ... in other words, actually experiencing a significant move upward, seeing real losses (thought not wipeouts), realizing that the experience was a once in a couple years phenomenon, and then gaining the confidence to trade through it to profitability using the same techniques is an amazing confidence builder.  I tell people all the time that if they are worried about the concept of infinite loss, what they are really saying is that they are worried about what happens when a sold option goes ITM.  So, the best way to deal with that fear is to actively trade it. Start by putting a couple positions directly ATM, let it go ITM and take a loss. Then trade out of it.  There is nearly infinite time and strikes on SPX, and through the use of moving out and away, combined with offsetting income-generating positions, you'll see how you can dig out of any hole over 3-6 months.  Once I learned how to do this, then really maximizing my leverage on selling far OTM calls was ramped up.

It's now at [www.fullyinformed.com](https://www.fullyinformed.com), and she's professionalized it, added a number of different strategies, and is still writing 4-6 blog posts a day. Her basic strategy is quite simple - pick the top 20 stocks on the planet that pay dividends where she has a very high confidence in the stock increasing in value over time, and then she sells cash secured puts against that stock, choosing entry prices using technical analysis so that she gets a very high likely entry. She was also perfectly ok with getting assigned the stock if she ever went ITM, treating the cumulative income from all the puts she sold as a form of \"discount\" to acquiring a high quality, dividend-paying stock.\n\nHer readings were phenomenal and it taught me the reality about rolling and adjustments, and how she thought about risk mgmt. I was able to leverage that knowledge into the insights that I have had where I was able to use maximum leverage in a way to get higher overall returns.

So stupid is as stupid does. Or, perhaps... [The Two Kinds of Moderate](http://paulgraham.com/mod.html) where Paul says, \" In the 20th century, a lot of very smart people were Marxists \u2014 just no one who was smart about the subjects Marxism involves.\"\n\nI've read the books on delta hedging, gamma scalping, tail hedging, seen the TastyTrade videos, power-researched the configurations in my IB, TOS, and eTrade tools to report on these statistics .... but for the same reasons that I stopped tracking Sortino / Sharpe statistics weekly I didn't follow through with minding the greeks - it was more effort than necessary and created a language of discussion that - in many ways - masks the true risk of trading.\n\nThere are quite a few - very good - professional options traders out there who manage entirely by the greeks. These threads are being read by both professionals and amateurs, a lot of my motivation for publishing such an approach is to motivate the amateurs to delve deeper by using language that an average investor can understand and meaningfully reason.\n\nI tried managing the algo by the greeks, which for most pro traders is really the only way to go, but ultimately I abandoned following it closely:\n\n1. There was a lot of extra work that goes into managing this way, and this algo is something that I look at briefly a couple times a day - I wouldn't call it actively being managed, and once you go down the greek path, you really do need to be in the more active mgmt column.\n2. For every type of greek risk, there is a potential hedge that you can layer on. That layering usually requires the addition of options, creating a type of [multi-faceted frankenstein](https://www.elitetrader.com/et/threads/portfolio-insurance-and-1987-crash.180405/). This consequently takes something that has a lot of risk or perhaps current losses, and turns it into something that is buffered by further price action, and probably gives a strong potential to recover losses. But, the down side is that collectively, the entire position stack can no longer be reasoned as a collective whole unless you only summarize it collectively by its summation greek position.  The trader is then bound to managing by the greeks, and so each trade is a subsequent exercise in maximizing theta followed by addressed vega, gamma, and delta risk as price action moves over time and space.\n3. Managing by the Greeks loses site of the algorithm's purpose - which is to capitalize upon markets that never crash upward, and that time is infinite. And so, describing the potential for leverage to accommodate these scenarios, and then staying largely true to the purpose is key to describing the goals of the trading format. As such, people should obsess about what can cause dramatic loss to the account - and this is ultimately price action spikes to one direction or another, which is kind of obvious since this is a price neutral strategy.\n4. Fundamentally, when people start playing around with options, they are using leverage, so the most important considerations that people have to make is what happens when options go ITM and then what should you do to either a) prevent that from happening, or b) if it does happen (like all of my calls are right now given the unsustainable melt up we are experiencing), what they would do about it. So, I like people thinking about - \"oh, I have 6 puts on at $3200 for $1M portfolio - what will happen and how will I feel if the market drops to $3100, $3000, $2500?\". This sort of reasoning then allows people to make some decisions to address that - do they want to buy a [tail hedge](https://thefelderreport.com/2016/08/15/worried-about-a-stock-market-crash-heres-how-you-can-tail-hedge-your-portfolio/), do they want to explore delta hedging, do they just want to avoid the risk by trading smaller starting position sizes?  For myself, when I was practicing with various hedging by the greeks, what I found was that while I could created complex positions that embodied less risk, I was giving a lot more to my broker because the number of options I had to buy dramatically increased. It was a lot to give up to smooth out the risk profile ... so it was better for me to just trade strangles, minimize the number of contracts I need to sell for maximum cash generation, and then address big market moves when they happen. In my case, this morning, I'll be having to push out a batch of calls maybe 45 days to keep it ATM and to generate enough cash to reduce some of those calls, while holding the puts slightly OTM, and also reducing their total as well, as I expect that in early January we will see some corrective actions to this price action.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Huh?

I just choose to think about the price that SPX would need to hit for me to encounter a wipe out scenario, and then making adjustments to make that more favorable in situations where markets are behaving in once-a-year or (gulp) black swan scenarios.\n\nMy risk calculations go something like this:\n\n1) When starting a new position, start with position sizing to accommodate a maximum draw down, which is these days a 50% drop in SPX (without absorbing a margin call), and a 15% rise in SPX (without absorbing a margin call). I think both IB and TDA require minimum $100K NLV in your accounts to maintain PM privileges, so I use $100K a the max loss absorption. \n\n2) Generally, the total cash collected is roughly 50% across all of the puts and 50% across all of the calls. Though if a trader has a market bias of direction, you might move this around a bit. This affects the strike selection. You can trade this with near term expirations, or further away. The amount of cash to collect and the ultimate strike selection is a starting point based upon a targeted weekly return rate. For simple measures, I tend to start with a 1% rate of return for a month and then when things are going favorably, there are many ways to keep adjusting / tightening without increasing risk to collect more cash, and that is where returns creep up to 2.5% / month.  If you look at the delta for this starting position, the delta should be almost flat, maybe a little bit negative - it varies over time.\n\n3) Starting positions are easy to reason. It's maybe 1/2 the time that you don't need to adjust the position as the market isn't moving really in a way that affects a side. But when you need to adjust, the delta has decidedly gone more negative or more positive depending upon the direction of the move. Given the aggressive up moves, my calls are ATM or ITM in spite of adjustments and my delta is significantly negative, while gamma has also gone negative.  So adjustments are made not by increasing position sizing, by my rolling calls to a position that generates cash, allows to remove calls, moves them further out of the money ... and then adjusting puts to doing similar things - closer to ATM, generating cash, and keeping the full position sizing in place.  These things - of course - affect the various greek ratios, but I don't follow them. I reason the resulting after-adjustment move risk profile in the following ways:\n\na) Reevaluate what is the SPX price where I now would hit my margin call scenario. The before / after picture should be some sort of dramatic improvement.\n\nb) Reevaluate this for both sides of the equation - both the threatened size, and then the unthreatened side.\n\nc) Use these inputs to then ask myself what is likely the overall position to look like if the market stays flat, keeps moving up, or reverses and moves down. Am I ok with subtle moves vs. a significant move. I think think about the rolls / adjustments that would be made to accommodate those situations.\n\nd) Each move should be reducing risk on a side that is threatened until that side is no longer threatened, and then I return it to maximum position sizing.\n\ne) If the market had a once-in-a-year move - say down >7% in a single day, or >3% up in a single day, it comes down to asking whether you want to short circuit out of the entire position to just cut any losses and run, or recognizing that you have significant leverage ITM at that point, and that you have to get extremely aggressive to compensate from further losses: pushing positions to far dated expirations, buy offsetting futures to just \"freeze\" all action, or potentially doing nothing if the thinking is that the price action may eventually recover.\n\nf) Because I am generally ok to not have any desire to touch the capital in my trading accounts for >3-5 years, I tend to view my time horizon as infinite. So as long as I never lose all of the capital, then even significant losses from deep ITM puts (say from a 30% drop in a single day of SPX) are things that I should be able to recover fully within that time frame. If the market were to drop 10% today, while it's a bit hard to model, the puts that I have expiring today would have a $330 loss (for me about a 18% NLV drop), and if you wanted to sell the same priced LEAPS three years out, you'd probably be able to get those right around $2600-$2800 strike depending up on a number of factors. Higher strikes if you wanted to take some options off of the table ... and the risk profile has significantly changed as there will be fewer puts, they will hopefully be ATM or OTM which improves the total downside window to a margin call, and along the way would have been selling maximum position calls which are offsetting the losses ... being careful to not get too close so as not to face catastrophe if the market rebounded for the full 10% immediately thereafter.  So what started out as a total wipe out scenario occurring around SPX $1600 when the trade was opened, post adjustments the wipe out scenario would be closer to $1200-$1400, and this improves further as further adjustments are made.\n\ng) One issue is vega risk with having so many naked calls. In the flash crashes, even short calls that are 10% OTM have exploding value ... which affects NLV. For this reason, I moved away from IB as TDA will give you time to make adjustments to deal with any immediate fluctuations. You can just buy some $.05 calls or let the TDA systems get back to harmony. I had IB liquidate a big position many years ago in a flash crash because my very profitable call position had exploded due to vega.\n\nWhile there are greek calculations for all of these scenarios, I just haven't chosen to monitor, nor track them.

When one needs to, aggressively defend, not every broker may recognize e.g. SPY as an offsetting position.

But sometimes if the market has moved down quite a bit and I believe a rebound is coming, then I might want 70% of income from puts and 30% from calls.  So if I am trading a $3M account, then I want to generate $7,500 for the week. If it's 50% / 50%, then I need $3,750 for calls, another $3,750 for puts.  I separately already determined how many puts / calls contracts that I will open based upon risk tolerances. So in this case it would be 18 puts for $3M and probably around 75 calls.  So I would be looking for the strike that gets me $2.10 for the puts and $.50 for the calls.

The same principle would apply with calls on the upside.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "The call side is easier to address than the put side. Doing long dated calls to convert them into call spreads eats away significantly at profits. I'm usually opening naked calls at $.5-$.3 / call for credit. So buying $.05 calls to create spreads eats away at profits signifcantly and doesn't really buy much. It's fairly easy to roll calls out and up on an nearly indefinite basis. So taking huge losses from calls that endlessly are under pressure is almost an impossibility. Markets don't tend to keep bouncing up causing bigger and bigger losses - so I can just keep reducing call leverage and moving out / up for additional credit.\n\nI once - around 2015 or so, when QE3 or something similar was announced, had 200 naked calls that got caught ITM. It was the first time where I had that much leverage. It took nearly 9 months, but I pushed them so far out and up, and then in the following 6 months the market eventually stabilized. The theta worked itself out and had puts aggressively slightly OTM. What turned one year to be a negative return year caused the following year to be nearly 60% - smoothing out the returns overall.\n\nThe bigger challenge is the puts side. Terri from fullyinformed only trades put spreads for the reason that you cite. But she looks out a month or so. I'll give some examples of what she does. \n\nI've had a hard time reasoning about spreads:\n1) First, I expect 5-7% movements of the price action to be normal. So if I am selling puts 2-4% OTM over the first week, then it's perfectly reasonable to use normal adjustment techniques when the market is correcting in a bull market. Opening up log puts that are at $2880 in your scenario (and especially when VIX is low) are just throwing away money as the circumstances where the market would shed 10% right now would require 2-4 weeks to play out, not over a single week.  So the short term nature of doing put spreads doesn't create the protection that you would want it to, unless you made it tight - like a 10 pt spread ... which would create different issues.\n\n2) So, doing spreads where you can guarantee the downside makes a lot more sense if your naked portion is at least 5-7% OTM, and the market is giving you indications of that there is strong movement that was building up over a couple days, and then turns into an avalanche.  I mentioned Terri's approach - she looks to make 2-4% return / month by opening 50 pt put spreads roughly 8-9% OTM with a month to expiration. She says she is getting about $3 / spread right now, but it's closer to $1.70 when I checked this am. Let's call it $2 / spread.  This would require 100 spreads to get 2% cash generation for $1M, or $500K at total risk. 200 spreads if you were going to get 4%. 90% of the time you are going to make a killing doing this. But when the strikes are pressured or the market has that big drop, then you are going to need to roll a spread. Now many people will say that you can roll a spread and generate a credit - that may be true if you are able to do it 2-3% OTM, but if that spread goes ITM either partially, then you might be able to get a credit. But if it's fully ITM where both legs have gone down, it will be impossible to adjust and get a credit - all rolls at that point are costing you money.  The other thing is that your saving adjustments are limited here - because you have levered up so much, you cannot sell the long puts and leave the short puts. You've used up too much margin and have to maintain the credit spreads to protect yourself.  The only flexibility that you have is hopefully selling a ton of calls OR making the long-dated puts $100 point spreads after the roll, which is then putting 100% of your capital at risk.\n\nWhen you look at this type of spread model, the further out in time you look to get further OTM, the more spreads you have to open and your risk profile increases. It just gets worse over time. \n\n3) So no matter how I've sliced it, it seems that as long as your calls are not threatened, and if you believe that a market crash wouldn't just happen unless there is first some downward pressure of at least 5-7%, then the way that seems pretty comfortable is to open up puts about 1 month out, roughly 7% OTM and get roughly .5%, recognizing that you will be able to get a lot more credit through rolls and adjustments if the market is behaving normally, and if it's dropping fast, you can roll / adjust more quickly ... and if there is a once in a life time event where the market is truly going to crash on you, just take your lumps, ignore the net liquidation value, and adjust out of it using extra ordinary techniques.\n\n5) I've even reasoned about just buying long dated puts for roughly .1% of the portfolio value every month, but this almost never pays out. If you had $1M account, let's say that you bought $1K worth of $1 puts that are three months out every month. Right now this would be $2025. After three months of this, you would have obtained 30 puts vs. the 6 naked puts that you are moving to some appropriate location for best income gain.  If you model things out, this sort of portfolio - if you had it on today - would have a max loss of 28% if the market went straight down today, but your break even point would occur at SPX $1900 before the increasing value of the long puts over took the decreasing value of the short puts.  That would be a 40% crash.  but the issue with this is that VIX is low right now - that sort of crash would only occur unexpected if there was a total disaster, such a nuclear bomb occurring on Wall Street (and heaven help us all if that sort of catastrophe took place). The more likely situation is an erosion of public trust, a reduction of earnings, and the market becoming more volatile leading up to a crash. And the issue there is that everything is becoming more expensive, so that $1000 you used to buy long puts ends up forcing you to buy those puts so far OTM that they aren't effectively offering protection.\n\nThis all comes down to a choice of the trader. If opening spreads, increasing the leverage creates a sense of disaster protection, then it's definitely not a bad thing to do.  But there will eventually be consequences when you do have to adjust. I've just always reasoned it out that trading smaller, expecting to be frequently ITM, and then having a large number of tools in the tool kit to trade out of it within a max of 3-5 years if disaster strikes was comfortable.

Your point about being leveraged hurting you when rolling because of having to roll both sides of the spread I hadn't thought of. \n\nAdditional thanks for the recommendation of Fully Informed, I have been perusing her material quite a bit over the past 48 hours. My knowledge has been much more technical and her material has a much more practical focus that is very beneficial. What caused your to prefer a strategy of weekly calls & puts over her strategy focusing more on just puts with slightly farther out expirations? Is it wanting to avoid making a directional prediction for the underlying and being able to roll easier with shorter starting expirations?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "The original strategy of Terri required timing the market to sell cash secured puts when the price of the underlying was at a lower technical band. I had issues because I wanted a strategy where I had all of my cash leveraged all the time - within safe parameters.  My thinking was that I should be able to put a lot less effort into the work because it was mechanical and didn\u2019t involve any timing analysis.\n\nI know she has changed things significantly since a decade ago and so maybe she is doing something different that uses leverage safely.  But be aware that what I do represents all of my spare cash.  She is running a bunch of different systems so she has a form of diversification which make her more risk taking on strategies that can fall out from underneath because her other ones have a safer floor.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Interesting.\n\nI have been messing around with back testing your program for myself and it has given rise to yet another question if you would. Because of the smaller quantity of puts relative to calls you sell in order to be able to absorb a 50% decline in the underlying I am finding many weeks where, in order to still receive 50% of your premium from your puts, the strike price's difference from the underlying at the time of selling is actually less for the puts than that of the calls. Yet in your article you seem to say the puts' percent off the underlying price should be 1-3% greater than that of the calls.\n\n>With a VIX at 23, this gives 2\u20133% protection on the upside and 3\u20136% downside protection, depending upon the strike selected. With a VIX at 13, you get about 1% protection on the upside and 2% on the downside.\n\nSo in these situations do you change your premium ratio, instead obtaining say 60% of your premium from calls in order to keep your puts farther off the strike price?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "That is a solid - it depends. Generally, I consider myself really bad at picking price direction. So if I am ignorant, I will find the strikes that give me 50 percent of income from puts and calls.\n\nIf I feel that the puts are too close to ATM because of a low VIX grind up - and there could be a reversal, then I would be inclined to think about opening the positions 2, 3, or 4 weeks away so that I can get a sufficient buffer to del with any sudden spikes in volatility or allowing price action to move with more freedom before I need to step in for an adjustment.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["vix"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["vix"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5955783724784851}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.7038002610206604}], "tickers": ["crash", "vix"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["crash"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Thanks for sharing Tyler.
