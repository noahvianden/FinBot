{"title": "GOOGL insider info", "selftext": "Ok, I work in Silicon Valley and am close with a guy who works on Google\u2019s deepmind project. I was actually able to watch the recent Starcraft 2 replays before the news got out due to him, cool guy. Anyway, for years he\u2019s been going on about how trading as we know it is finished as soon as deepmind is unleashed into the financial world. We recently got drinks together and he got a bit too tipsy and tearfully confided in me that he\u2019s actually chief lead of the project and that things aren\u2019t going well. Apparently, across all the simulations deepmind is making a ton of money for months and months (like up thousands and thousands of percent) but then somehow, as the algorithm is sorting through recourses online, it eventually finds WSB and then he said the next trading day it usually all-in\u2019s FDs on shitty companies like MU, JD, or NBEV and then it\u2019s all over. Dude was pretty broken up about it, said they can\u2019t find a way around it. Anyway, there\u2019s my insider information, maybe short $GOOGL. Deepmind is here, do what you will with that information.
