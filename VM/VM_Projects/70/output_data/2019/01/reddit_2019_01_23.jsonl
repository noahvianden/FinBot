I've had triple digit years, but also those -50% ones.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI personally vote for: SPY, VTI, etc.; nice diversified ETFs. They're a bit slower, but odds of losing tons of money permanently are low. Temporarily, sure - but over time the economy chugs on and these ETFs rise as years/decades progress. And they rise much more than money in the bank, so if you can stomach volatility, you profit with time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have been studying shipping stocks and Canadian oil stocks. Lots of them are trading at levels as low as 3x cashflow, but the dividends are usually sub-10% and most cashflow is going towards deleveraging. The market doesn't seem to like that. For some good examples, check out TGP, NMM, [CVE.TO](https://CVE.TO), etc.; deep discounts, stocks are in the toilet, market yawns.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nProbably the safest way to get a guaranteed 20% is to wait patiently in cash for volatile periods like December 2018, track preferred shares and preferred share CEFs (Closed End Funds - JPC, JPS, FFC, FLC, etc.) which are often as volatile as common shares, but tend to snap back afterwards. You want the CEFs, not the ETFs, because ETFs perfectly track their holdings. The CEFs can disconnect based on supply and demand, and they post the NAV (Net Asset Value) for you on their website, so you always know the exact discount. During December this supply/demand imbalance of shares led to 20% discounts, where you could buy a fund with $9.xx of preferred shares for $7.40. As it snaps back to NAV, you profit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStocks like TGP also have their own preferred shares available, and when the market gets skittish, they depart from $25 par value, present a buying opportunity, and then later return to par. Very easy capital gains, usually happening every 1-2 years. I have played SSW (Seaspan) preferred shares a few times, getting them at $20 each time and selling not long after, back at $25.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat said, I'd probably just do the ETFs.
