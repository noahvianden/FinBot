To me it looks like, even assuming high growth, netflix is still overvalued from a PE perspective. What are your thoughts on that?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Again, PE is just kind of a poor metric in most cases and particularly poor on something like NFLX.  With NFLX you can get an enormous amount of scale from the business.  For the most part, new subscriptions are kind of icing on the cake.  So things like SG&A expenses are not going to be linear to subscriber growth.  In fact, it wouldn't necessarily have to grow at all (although I'm sure it is growing some each year with NFLX, maybe even considerably in the near term but that should level off).  So expenses like payrol, HR, accounts pay/rec, headquarters occupancy expense et al, none of those departments would need to expand in anyway for \"one more subscription\".  Think of it like the last dollar spent at a Wal-Mart.  You get a lot of leverage on the sales at the back end as all of the fixed expenses are covered.   \n\nAlso they spend a ton of money on content and their own original content.  I'm no NFLX expert, so I don't know exactly how those streaming agreements work.  But for their original content it is pretty simple.  Additional subscribers are just going to allow for amortization of the original content expense over more accounts.  And there is just some level of \"good ideas\" limit per year.  I don't know what the number is, but lets just say 12B of content spending per year is kind of the upper limit of \"good ideas\".  Maybe even say 15B ( I think currently they are at about 9B).    \n\nSo now look at 5 years out and say subs have gone from 150m to 300m with 6% average yearly price increases (use $10 for year 1). So after 5 years you have 300m subs @ $13.38/month x 12 months.  So now you are looking at top line revenue ~48B compared to about 15B this year.  And remember a lot of those expenses aren't going to increase at the pace of revenue.    \n\nThese are all hypothetical numbers.  And again, I am no NFLX expert and am not long or short the name.  My only point in the original comment above is you can't just look at NFLX (or AMZN for example) and see a high PE ratio and think it is automatically wildly expensive.  It could be expensive, and if the subscriber story with NFLX doesn't work out it will be proven to be expensive, but the point is there is just way more to the argument than headline PE.  \n\nI hope this is helpful.

", "score": -1, "replies": [{"body": "It doesn't matter what show they have that YOU will be willing to pay to watch. For all we know, you could have very picky taste or not be that into movies and television. For most people though, they have a huge array of movies, TV shows, comedy specials, kids programming, and original content that they are more than happy to pay for and it's not going to change anytime soon. They currently have the biggest and most talked about movie of the winter in Bird Box and if you think the success of that movie is a fluke for Netflix, then you're just being naive.

I agree, I think Reed Hastings has great vision and that the company has always been ahead of the curve.
