Right now that would cost him $40,000 to buy about $30,500 worth of stock.  That is offset by the $9,800 he made on writing the option though, so honestly not completely horrible.

The breakeven is $236.70/share.\n\nThe thing to understand is when you are short an option contract playing by USA market rules, you can get assigned during market hours at any time.  Therefore if you\u2019re selling covered puts, then at any time you can be forced to honor the strike price whenever the put contract holder decides it\u2019s go time regardless if the put is wildly out of the money (very rare), at the money (rare unless near expiration), or deeply in the money (not rare at all but this far out my guess is most put holders will let it ride a bit closer to expiration).\n\nLet\u2019s say you have $30k in your account and you write 1 Jan 2020 TSLA $300p.  If it\u2019s a covered put, your broker will basically put a hold on that $30k as collateral in case you get assigned (option holder exercised).  So if TSLA dips down to $250 near expiration and the $300p is exercised, you would have to buy 100 shares for each contract you wrote at $300/share, or $30k, but each contract you sold gave you $6,330, so with TSLA at $250, your account would be worth $31,330, so even though you were fairly deep ITM your account still comes out ahead.  Obviously riding the option to expiration would take you from $30,000 to $36,330, a much better deal.\n\nThis is all very different if you\u2019re selling naked options.

Basically you buy a put for X date, and then you sell a put for the same date, buy/write.  The put you buy will be for $Y strike, the put you sell will be $Y \u2013 C, with C being the width of your spread.  Your max profit will be if the stock goes under the $Y-C value and stays there on/near the expiration date (X) for your contracts.
