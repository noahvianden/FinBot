{"title": "I was on the hook for a couple mil in a box spread one time", "selftext": "https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/877qhi/a_viable_options_strategy/?st=JR1R28UQ&sh=6d6f663a\n\nA while ago I was messing around with option strategies and I came across what I honestly thought was arbitrage. I never found a name for the strategy exactly but it\u2019s very much like a box spread just with a broken top or bottom. As you can see I was able to execute huge ranges on AMZN for next to no collateral. I thought it was free money so I went balls to the wall that day. I had about 10-15 of these on AMZN and 92 on SPY. Keep in mind 92x100=9200 shares of spy. \n\nObviously I think I had a nice 10 bagger that day no prob, assignment won\u2019t happen and if it does , I\u2019m covered. Go to sleep, wake up the next morning to Tastyworks risk management calling me. Fuck. So I answer , open my laptop. Turned out I got assigned all 92 short puts of SPY and maybe 5 AMZN. It was close to $2.5 mil passed my allotted margin. Needless to say they weren\u2019t cool with me in the position. \n\nSo I\u2019m on the phone, markets about to open in ten minutes , I\u2019m freaking out thinking I\u2019m u/1ronyman .  Luckily for me, market opens much higher that day. *But* you can only imagine how hard it is to close a trade like that. The dude from TW is just pseudo using my account as I watch him try to close this trade hoping market doesn\u2019t reverse early morning. I was watching my account fluctuate by thousands how it normally does dollars. I was fortunate enough to have been exited out of that position at a profit of about a thousand or so, I never really calculated everything. Then also I paid $400 for the day of $2,500,000 margin lmao. I figured out this trade is only arbitrage if you have that $2.5 or so to take assignments with and hold stock till the other options expire for profit. & also at that point the return isn\u2019t worth the investment. \n\nTL;DR, Box spreads are fucking stupid. Use a broker that will assist you in exiting a trade to everyone\u2019s best financial interests.
