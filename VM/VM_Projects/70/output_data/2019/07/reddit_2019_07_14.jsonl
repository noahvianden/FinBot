The ATM put/call with a strike of $100 are trading at let\u2019s say $2.50. Selling both will credit your account $500. The $105 call and $95 put might be trading at $0.75, so if you buy these as a hedge you are credited for a net $3.50. The further out you buy the long options the more risk you\u2019re technically allowing, but the higher the probability of succeeding due to collecting more credit. I typically run Iron flies on high IV stocks (usually 75-150% of normal IV) to capture the crush. Last season I returned 20% on total account value selling iron flies.
