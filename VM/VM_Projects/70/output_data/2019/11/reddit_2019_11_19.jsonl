Battery industry will be booming in the next 10 years (due to EVs and in general widespread use of electronics) \u2014> cobalt, lithium and nickel prices will definitely go up significantly. Respective metals producer can benefit from this, e.g. Norilsk Nickel. Can also think of the large battery producers, but these companies are usually diversified (e.g., Panasonic), and as a result you can a lot of noise in this exposure. Also, you can imagine new producers entering the field\n\n2. AI is the next big thing in technology - you will see widespread use of these type of algorithms everywhere in the next 10 years \u2014> the issue here is that we may not yet know the new players in the field. One can argue that Microsoft and Alphabet are the obvious candidates to win the game, but remember internet in 90s - none of the leaders from that time are relevant now, same can happen in AI. So would rather carefully watch for new emerging players here... especially if you look at the current multiples of Microsoft and Alphabet...\n\n3. A bit riskier bet would be China consumer market. Even though the GDP growth is slowing down it is still a very \u201cpoor\u201d country in terms of GDP per capita. Thus, I would expect China to continue to grow. In this case you can think of Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu as the companies still with significant potential. \n\n4. Environment.
