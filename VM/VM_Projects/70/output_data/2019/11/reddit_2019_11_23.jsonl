{"title": "66K Gains in a Month", "selftext": "Update on my last post. Closed out most of my AMD long calls at around ~$38-40. Started stepping into puts at 39+ each day AMD went higher. Sold 2/3 of them during the dip this morning. \n\n\nUp about 20k since my last post a week ago. \n\n\nGot into options around the end of May, used to be only stocks. Biggest draw down was about $55,000, 110k to 55k. All of my plays have been buying Calls on AMD, and recently Puts.\n\n\n\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/tYX6juC\n\n\nGoing back long soonish, Monday is the Threadripper/3950x launch but then there is a dead patch till CES.
