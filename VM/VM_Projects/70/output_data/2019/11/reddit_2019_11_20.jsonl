{"title": "Long PTON (BYND part deux)", "selftext": "Disclaimer: I am not making a recommendation to do anything. I am just writing about a potential short squeeze I see in the market and how I am currently positioned to take advantage IF that unlikely squeeze ever occurs. Do NOT follow me in this trade. I am not an analyst and I have no clue what I am doing. \n\nI recently bought Jan $35 calls in Peloton. To me, it has many of the same SHARE fundamentals that BYND had after this IPO. (Obviously not business similarities)\n\n1. Relatively low float compared to shares outstanding (40m share float vs 280m total shares locked up until March.\n\n2. Passionate user base that hypes the everloving shit out of the product and preaches how no other competitor is the same as them\n\n3. Due to point 2, a \u201cdumb money\u201d retail base of investors that buy the stock because they like the product, ignoring valuations\n\n4. On trend (subscription based, healthy, the \u201cnew\u201d it product, etc)\n\n5. Insanely overvalued- this is actually a positive because it has led to point 6\n\n6. CRAZY high short interest as a percentage of the float. As of this morning it was 84%. Every \u201csmart money\u201d investor and trader is looking at this and saying \u201cthis POS is a fad and totally overvalued. I\u2019m going to short it!\u201d Just like BYND was at $80 when I first bought calls. It definitely WILL crash and burn and come back to earth at some point- but not before wiping out the shorts and causing a squeeze to a valuation deemed \u201cludicrous\u201d \n\nI bought my calls on Monday for between $0.35-$1.00 I believe. \n\nI definitely might be wrong.
