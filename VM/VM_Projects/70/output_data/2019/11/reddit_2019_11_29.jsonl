It's about the iPhone instantly obsoleting the iPod.\n\nThe difference between Apple and Tesla, of course, is that Apple contracts out their manufacturing. Apple, should they need to do a 180 (because everyone who wanted an iPod now wants an iPhone) can simply do that. Tesla cannot: they have too much investment in CapEx that they need to recoup.

This is a 19-20 foot long vehicle.  For reference, a Model S or X is about 16-16.5 feet long.   A Model 3 just a bit over 15 feet long.  In many Asian and European countries, Cybertruck is impractical to park due to its size.  In many European locations, Cybertruck cannot easily navigate narrow streets.  Overseas customers are not going to stop ordering Model S, X, and 3 in favor of the Cybertruck.    \n\nThe size is also problematic for some American garages.  Honda shrank the dimensions of the North American 9th Generation (2013-2017) Accord sedan, in part due to the 8th Generation (2008-2012) being too big.  A Honda engineer living in Ohio had problems parking the 195\" long Accord in their modest suburban garage.  For many Americans, similarly sized Model S and X are already too big.  They are not likely to buy Cybertrucks.  They will be buying Model 3 and Model Y.  \n\nYour argument hinges on an unrealistic assessment of the consumer market.  You can hope that Cybertruck will cause the Models (S, X, 3, and Y) to plummet in sales, but the most likely outcome is that your hope will be in vain.  Cybertruck on net expands Tesla's market.  It won't affect existing market to a significant degree. \n\nSoccer moms won't be buying Cybertrucks any more than they are choosing F-150s over Honda CR-Vs and Lexus RXs.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["aapl", "tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["aapl", "tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.25121989846229553}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4453960359096527}, {"body": "Why?

{"title": "My (short term) predictions", "selftext": "Here are my short term predictions on $TSLA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2019 Q4**\n\nTo reach the lower end of the target (360k) they need to deliver 104.5k vehicles this quarter (vs 97k in Q3). A consistent production of at least 8k per week is needed to hit this target and without any deliveries in China this quarter it will be hard. For reference, Q3 was 7.5k per week. Therefore, I expect a very close miss, with max 2k or 3k fewer.\n\nWall street will react slightly negative to this, but soon realise that this is an amazing achievement and that the profitability and cashflow are way more important. And there I expect very good news, equal to Q3. Q3 EPS was 1.86 vs -0.42. I expect Q4 to be more or less the same, again beating the estimate (1.29).\n\nElon will make a remark that the (US) demand is very strong, strengthened by the Cybertruck media storm. No matter what you think of that truck, it definitely raised brand awareness. Some people in my surroundings think EVs have a range of 50 - 100 km because that's what they hear about hybrids... A truck with 800 km range should raise some interest.\n\nTesla ends the year with a 'yearly rate' of more than 400k units, without GF3 and model Y. Let's pause for a minute and realise that Adam Jonas predicted in 2014 that Tesla will not deliver the forecasted 500k units by the *end of the decade* but only 297k. He's already proven wrong in 2019.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2020 Q1**\n\nQ1 is the weakest in this industry. In 2019 this was even worse because of the US demand that was pulled into 2018 Q4. The same is happening now, US demand is slightly pulled in the current quarter because of the same reasons. That is why deliveries stopped in the EU (\"sold out\"), to focus on US. And there lies the difference with last year: EU is up and running. There will be a backlog of EU demand going into Q1. This will make Q1 somewhat better in terms of deliveries. Also the deliveries from GF3 in China will start in this quarter. I also expect Tesla to realise deferred FSD revenue mostly in this quarter, and some other help from credits and FCA will help to make this quarter better. The quarter might even be profitable. *(Did anybody say S&P 500?)*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Other predictions**\n\n* Q2 2020: Deliveries of model Y will start, the \"battery day\" will get us excited, model S Plaid update (?), ...\n* Near the end of the year 2020, the Roadster will get back into the spotlight, which is very good for the brand.\n* The margin on the Model 3s produced in GF3 will be way better than expected.\n* By 2022, I think it's possible that Tesla will reach 1 million S3XY units sold. 700k produced in the US, 175k in GF3 and the rest in GF4. With an average SP of 60k that gives us 60B in revenue. This average SP seems feasible with FSD features, slightly more expensive model Y and model S Plaid success. That's without the semi-truck, Cybertruck, Roadster, FSD and the energy products. I mostly expect heavy revenues from the energy products. This will be the division with the most potential growth by then.\n* With 60-70B in revenue, a market cap of at least 150B is to be expected. That would translate into a stock price of +- 800 USD.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThese are some thoughts to raise discussion and I think it will be fun for myself to look back and see what's right and wrong. There are a lot of risks involved too.

I was wondering if you can comment about whether you felt that Q2 benefited from consumers in the U.S. sort of rushing out to buy Model 3 in advance of the declining federal tax credit, a phenomenon that you sort of saw in Q4. And part of the reason I ask is, at least by my analysis it looks like maybe 70% of the Model 3 sold in the quarter were in the U.S., which is sort of higher than your normalized percentage of U. S. sales. And so, do you feel that that phenomena may have occurred in Q2? And are you still confident that Q3 **deliveries can improve sequentially**? And beyond the data point that you provided on the call that the orders quarter data are better than last quarter, is there anything else you can point to that provides that confidence?\"\n>\n> **Elon Musk:**\n>\n> \"Yeah, I think we'll -- demand in Q3 will exceed Q2. It has thus far, and I think we'll see some acceleration of that. So -- and then, I think Q4 will be, I think very strong. **So, we expect that quarter-over-quarter improvements. I think Q1 next year will be tough.** I think Q3 or Q4 will be good, Q1 will be tough. Q2 will be not as bad, but still tough. And then I see like Q3 and Q4 next year will be incredible.\"\n\nIf Q4 is going to be a record quarter with the usual end of year rush and 105,000 deliveries then Q1 will likely not be able to increase deliveries quarter over quarter - but could still be profitable.\n\nElon's answer was strictly in terms of quarter-over-quarter sequential demand improvements, it says nothing about profitability - for example if Tesla \"only\" delivers Q3 number of cars in Q1 it can still be comfortably profitable.\n\nThere's also these profitability upsides in Q1'20, which neither Q3'19 nor Q4'19 benefited from:\n\n- Large amounts of FSD revenue dependent on Tesla's FSD software reaching \"feature complete\" status is not recognized yet, which will be converted into GAAP profits at a rate of well over 90%. That's a piggy bank Tesla could use in a weak quarter. In the Q3 report Tesla guided for $500m of deferred revenue recognition over the next 12 months (i.e. until Q3'2020), which is probably front-loaded, i.e. a good chunk of it could be recognized in Q1.\n- The EU ZEV pooling agreement with FCA starts in Q1 2020, which could bring in about $10,000 per Tesla delivered in Europe in Q1: at 30,000 EU deliveries that's a cool +$300m of pure revenue and 100% margin profits with no cost of goods ... There's very little known about the details of the agreement though, the dollar figures are guesses based on the penalties that FCA faces.\n- The GF3 order backlog is likely significant (tens of thousands of units), and if they can produce say 2k/week at GF3 in Q1 on average, delivering ~25k units at $50k ASP, that's another +$1.25b of revenue with significantly higher margins than U.S. made cars.\n\nBut I share your caution, and it's true that Q1 profitability is not in the bag, and the bad Q1'2019 results should make us cautious about all of this.
