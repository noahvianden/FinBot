Idk if older people have never been exposed to edgy content but literally just having tiddies in a scene makes them think a show is groundbreaking or pushing a new boundry. I don't think I've watched a single good original Netflix show besides American Vandal, but every month there is some new show everyone over the age of 30 is obsessed with that they put out. They also have a decent hold on stand up comedy specials which isn't huge but stand-up comedy seems to be on the rise lately so if they can stick with that who knows they could catch the lightning in a bottle comedy Central did in the 90's.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "> Netflix originals will save Netflix.\n\nWe'll see next month when *The Witcher* releases.", "score": 5, "replies": [], "tickers": ["nflx"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Do you really think Netflix continuously adding 2.5 billion of debt to there OC budget EVERY fuckin year is sustainable?

I don't feel like reciting the IB101 guide to you but, Net asset value is when you value the companies assets, assume they are sold to repay liabilities and whatever remains goes to equity. Doing EV/EBITDA or dumb ass liquidation models for companies that are heavily leveraged will never help you arrive a fair value multiple. Simply what you are stating is correct but A) to real estate, oil & gas and Insurance industry and and B) not to a company where its business plan is to increase its margins by creating more original content but the reason its margins are shrinking is because they are constantly creating new original content. I am curious as to why you see that being relevant?\n\nEDIT: in the most basic math of what I am saying: 5 billion divided by 438.25 Million shares outstanding?
