I think Gene Munster had it right - there is a lot to be optimistic about, but Tesla is going to go through at least 2Q (if not a few more) of pain.   \n\n\nThat being said, I think Wall Street is totally missing the boat on what Tesla presented at Autonomy Day. On the technical side what they showed was extremely exciting. What they basically painted was a reasonable technical roadmap for:  \n1) Cheaper, energy efficient chips, hyper optimized for the calcs they need for their neural net. On top of it they've already built the chip, they've shown they have the technical headroom for significant growth in compute/data processing, and they're already working on the next iteration. \n\n2) Neural net and using non-simulated data to grow at scale. I feel like what was lost a little bit was that they only rolled out this hardware and scaling this year. If in 3 months with a limited fleet they improved that much, how much better will they get by the end of the year? Elon is still guessing around how the exponential curve will ramp, but if you're betting on Waymo/other self driving cars, this doesn't seem unreasonable.  \n\n\nOn the business side, everyone seems to think we have to wait until the Robotaxis and regulation are through to see value. If you have a car that actually is orders of magnitude better for self driving (even if its not regulation approved) why \\_wouldn't\\_ you buy it? Even if regulation doesn't come through it feels like sales will come rushing through when people see that this is not just vaporware.   \n\n\nI don't think Elon outright stated it, but I think this is why he's so convinced that demand will just explode. The cars even semi-close to Tesla's price point will just be irrational if FSD is good. With this lens it makes sense why he said this is what the whole company is orienting around.", "score": 6, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "How is S and X sales being cut in half domestically a short term blip?\n\nOr not being able to be CLOSE to profitable because margins on the Model 3 are not there?\n\nWhere do they pick up $700M in margin going forward?", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "TBF they really only need to pick up $502M in margin in order to hit breakeven.", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5825164914131165}, {"body": "> How is S and X sales being cut in half domestically a short term blip? \n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Timing: It's Q1, which is traditionally weaker for every car company. They're still up over Q1 '18.\n2. Design Age: It's an older design with potential changes incoming. See the BMW 5-series lackluster sales prior to the new design release. All models start strong then usually decline YoY until you refresh them.\n3. Internal Competition: The Model 3, value-wise, is tough internal competition when heavily equipped. See Porsche Cayman vs. 911 sales figures. As the Cayman gets better and better it steals *some* audience away from the 911. This has been aggravated by having some Model 3 models with more range than the Model S. New EV owners tend to have range anxiety and often buy as much range as they can afford, but 310 miles vs 335 wasn't that compelling when the price difference is so high. The longer-range Model S will help differentiate that.\n4.  Market Limitation: There's only so many people shopping in this price range and many Model S buyers are simply driving around in their Model S right now and don't need a new car. You can't convert someone who cannot afford your product.\n5. Model X Weakness:  The Model X is, to date, Tesla's weakest design. It costs a lot to build and it's not a great seller. Most people agree the S is attractive and many people like the look of the 3, but the X is more polarizing. An exterior refresh of the Model X would benefit its sales more than most cars from Tesla or anyone else, in my opinion.", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Sounds to me like sales fell because of the S and X lower production rates (for retooling) and the elimination of the base models (to drive people to highest margin model 3s from lowest margin Model S and Xs.

When they release the Y, and the pickup truck, I don't expect they will have any issues adapting to the new vehicle size.\n\nIf you think different vehicle dimensions are going to be an issue, it will probably be an issue for Tesla as well every time they release a new vehicle.

Big pickup trucks would require a little extra work for taking corners and such, but overall it shouldn't be a big deal.\n\nI think most manufacturers plan to sell news cars with full self driving to customers, the guy in the Nissan video I linked says they want to have that system in consumer cars.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "You're probably right.

It would be easier for tesla to not have to deliver cars to consumers because of their batch logistics issues they outlined yesterday in the conference call. and i saw somewhere they think that every car could represent $400k in revenue if they handle the tesla network itself. are current tesla car buyers really more like tesla's bank/ seed round funding for a company that would be more massive than amazon and would be an end to end autonomous transportation network, even obsoleting short flight airlines if they couple this with the boring company network?", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["amzn", "tsla"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Tesla for me has addressed every single concern I may have had about the business and about FSD. I understood maybe 25% of the autonomy presentation, and I have a CS degree, but it was enough for me to see how and why their FSD system works and will reach a maturity within the next couple years. From the business side they explained everything in the earnings call, basically addressed most or all of detractors' talking points. They even admitted they need to do better with PR, which seems to me a big part of why they did an Autonomy Day. Tesla as a business has become really mature and agile and cost efficient, and they never stop pushing to be better.", "score": 0, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.14662909507751465}, {"body": "Why are they saying Q2 will not be profitable ? \nQ1 makes sense coz of cars in Transit", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.06158443167805672}, {"body": "After I saw earnings results I was little bit terrified - loss is somewhat big and revenue low, I think most of us was expecting 100-200 mln. $ less loss and 200-300 mln. $ more revenue.\n\nBut after hearing that call there is high probability that S and X is one time inventory rise and actually production constrain for retooling. If it will go back at least to S + X 20 000pcs per quarter and with additional efficiencies on M3 production lines and better logistics to deliver more M3 -> that should be enough to at least be in black for Q2 which is what Tesla guide. Q3 and Q4 being seasonally strong (but another halving -> so maybe interior refresh leverage again?) looks like really back to profitability.\n\nThe only unknown is FSD. I was always huge bull on Tesla's EVs but FSD stopped convincing me after I realise how much time AP2 needed to get parity with AP1. Also 2016 FSD DEMO didn't help as in reality AP2 was poor implemented and it get significantly better in just say - for the last 6-9 months.\n\nAlthough after Autonomous Day I'm more confident, I get it that analysts and market are not conviced - seeing Waymo and Cruise gets such funcionality few years ago is disturbing. But I think Tesla has the right approach going without LIDAR. Waymo will get some market share but it will be geologically bound to only some few big cities in NA and it will be very slow to scale it to another parts of the globe. Some says they get also vision and will get rid of LIDAR, but I don't think it will also be that fast process. If they could to that - Kudos to them, as it will be actually smart - get LIDAR to start with something, impress everybody and then took Tesla approach in the background. But I don't think so, I think Tesla will get some time window (2-3-4 years maybe) when they will be very well positioned to satisfy over 50% of demand on FSD (but will be still constrained as it will be a hot cake in the market).\n\nAlso I thought competition with Uber/Lyft and Tesla Network was just smoke and mirrors 2-3 years ago. But Musk has reassured everybody now it is still what they are aiming for, and it's true master plan for FSD. I can see that valuation of that company now will be in limbo as going towards EV paradigim is not questioned anymore, now it is FSD actually. But if FSD is going to work you need a fleet, so that still needs to be paired at least with 1 mln cars per year. I have a feeling that Tesla will be in range 250-350$ (maybe just slightly > 400 if Shanghai GF3 execution is impressive) until FSD is not solved by them, but after that really interesting things can happen. By that alone I think the stock is more risky now, but there is much more at stake and potential reward for investors.\n\nEDIT: for all of the above, predictions of ARK Investment seems to me really less ridiculous than it seemed even one month ago, as 2016 FSD DEMO I've mentioned is really now something true and doable in same conditions (give or take, but @[galileorussell](https://www.reddit.com/user/galileorussell) can speak more about that as I believe he experienced it).\n\nTo be honest I didn't like Tesla Network in the first place, I like to drive my car. But that doesn't mean we will get rid of wheel anytime soon -> Musk is in the position where he thinks that regulators and customers will want to ban steering wheel as he bets on FSD as hell.
