For the people in the back, the model 3 has leather interior with incredibly spacious headroom and all glass roof for that spaceship feel. \n\nLeather seats? Wow such an amazing luxury features, why doesn't anyone else do that?\n\n>\tI guess I\u2019ll just post my source again.\n\n[Here's](https://chinapower.csis.org/china-middle-class/) another source. Clearly, with an average gross income of $14k per year the Model 3 is in the perfect price range for the Chinese, who are obviously just lining up at the chance of spending several years worth of income on a car.\n\n>\tSeeing how you have demonstrated that you know basically nothing about the market I\u2019d probably want to take you up on it if we get a bit more specific. I don\u2019t think \u201cHot Cakes\u201d is a great literal metric. It\u2019s also hard to predict where Tesla will chose to allocate it\u2019s production each quarter.

Some more key points I want to hit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou seem to have admitted that you pulled the \"Nonexistent Middle Class\" line completely out of thin air. \n\nBut the same is true for the rest of your arguments. Your key points are all completely made up with nothing to back it at all. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe bulk of your theory as to why they wont sell in china relies on only two things. No middle class (and then you back peddled to say relatively small middle class) and the people who can afford to buy one don't own their own cars.  \n\nThe first I've already proven is 100% false. There absolutely is a middle class and its the largest middle class in the world and the largest class in China. FYI, that source you posted only shows percentage data for 2015, the middle class has swelled dramatically since then as my more up to date post shows from 2018 data. Weird since they do post a lot of other facts from 2017 like the fact that Passenger car sales in China were \\*28.9 Million\\* compared to the US sales of only \\*17.5\\*. Not really a breakdown of market segments at all, but revealing none the less. The middle class and upper middle class are both enormous. Especially when you look at them as absolute numbers instead of percentages. China's population is staggering. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe second point you made is equally as baseless. There are virtually no services like the one you are describing. The market for personal drivers in China is not unlike that of Uber in the sates. The passenger essentially never owns the car. Either the limo company supplies the driver with a car or the driver uses their own car which is quickly [becoming a more popular option](https://www.scmp.com/tech/apps-gaming/article/1844341/didi-kuaidi-chinas-top-taxi-hailing-app-launches-personal-chauffeur) after failing to gain traction in the past. Ride sharing used to be taboo, but opinions are shifting. You made up your claim that most people with personal driver own the car they are getting driven in. I challenge you to provide any evidence to support that at all. Frankly I'd be impressed if you could even provide the name of a service that offers it in China. Those drivers want autopilot. Which is and option (increasing the available market size) and also included on all cars. Because they know almost everyone ends up getting it eventually. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBasically you've pulled this entire argument out of your butt. Impressive. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou're saying model 3 sales in china will be a disaster. What would you consider good premium car sales? Unlike other manufacturers, Tesla currently only has one factory servicing the globe so the number of cars they can deliver there are capped heavily.\n\n&#x200B;", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1536189168691635}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.0030353416223078966}], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["nflx", "tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.8611610531806946}], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.8278149366378784}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.8061791062355042}], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3513665795326233}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.42222297191619873}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4571765661239624}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5299545526504517}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6011040210723877}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.7318716049194336}, {"body": "Ok, so what is your prediction about Model 3 sales in China?
