This seems to be the crux of Elon's point -- that IF radar-like capabilities are needed (and I understand the nomenclature here that radar implies radiowaves, but I mean the term more generally), there are better frequencies to use than those used by LIDAR.\n\n2) Do you think it's a reasonable assessment that LIDAR may not even be needed with a sufficiently developed neural-network? The point made at the investor meeting is that if a human being can drive through snow/fog using only visual data to influence their actions, a neural network can be trained to do the same thing given enough unique situations for the network to learn from.\n\n3) Piggybacking off question 2, if you were using camera systems in your university, how developed were your neural networks in being trained for snow/fog?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "No problem.
