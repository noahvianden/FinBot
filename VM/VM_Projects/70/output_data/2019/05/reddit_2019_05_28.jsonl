You do know this is a ridiculous statement to make, right?\n\nNot at all.  Setting up a streaming service is peanuts for $DIS and others, and there are now many other content creators busy finishing up theirs now that concept has been demonstrated \u2013 they are avidly doing so and are cash-positive while doing so unlike Netflix.  The only thing Netflix has that is keeping people on their streaming services is content, and while I personally like much of the original content that Netflix has made, the fact is the vast majority of the watches on Netlfix are for content they license.  Content from companies like $DIS and NBC, all of whom will be taking their content away from Netflix after their streaming services are on line in a year or two. At that point Netflix will have mostly nothing but its own content, and the fact is the masses just don't seem to like Netflix's original content, they prefer the content of other content creators currently made available through Netflix \u2013 but which will not in the not-so-distant future.  Being in the content business with only the least popular content results in the demise of a business.\n\n>  Let me guess: You believe every poll that says '80% of netflix users would cancel if they removed The Office and Friends' or one of the historically-inaccurate \"60% of Netflix users say they'll cancel if Netflix raises price to $1\"\n\nI actually haven't seen those polls, but while their % seems a bit high and exaggerated, the trend and sentiment they indicate when Netflix looses their license not just for \"The Office\" but basically everything responsible for most of their re-watches seems true by all measurable indications.  Why would you expect people to keep their Netflix subscription if it gains adds, starts costing more, and all the content that most of them want to watch becomes only available on other streaming services?\n\n> You might as well just told me Walmart bought Jet.com and now they're gonna put Amazon outta business.\n\nThat isn't a reasonable metaphor at all.  To be an appropriate metaphor it would have to be like all the major brands and retailers responsible for all of Amazon's sails were busy finishing redundant supply chains to Amazon while being more profitable than Amazon while doing so, and all of them are about to never allow Amazon to sell any of these products again leaving Amazon with nothing to sell that anyone wanted.  Even that is quite as bad a situation as Netflix is in.\n\n> Netflix is basically the new International Hollywood\n\nExcept most people don't like their products as much as they still like old Hollywood's products (which is perfectly international already), and $DIS didn't just buy up the collective tokens of Original Hollywood, they did that but they are also finishing building out the streaming infrastructure to render Netflix to zero advantage like many other content creators are busy doing at the moment.\n\n> I don't know where to start with your TSLA conjecture. You didn't really present any facts,\n\nOkay, facts: Tesla just raised 2.4 billion in May with New bond issuance.  Musk himself has said this will only buy roughly 10 months continued operation runway for the company.  Until the company is profitable if it continues growing at its current rate relative to sales then it will continue to need this much money every 10 months from investors until it becomes profitable.  None of that is speculative or that out there, this is basically an Elon Admission.  Thus it simply follows that Tesla will need to be able to raise a new 2 billion to burn from investors every ten months until it becomes profitable or else it will either need to be acquired by a sustainable company or it will go bankrupt.  None of this is crazy, this is simply business 101.  Now as for when Tesla will become profitable **THAT** is a guess that I totally admit is a guess as I have no idea.  Maybe it will be next year, but I can't see how that is possible and there aren't any signs of that being the case.
