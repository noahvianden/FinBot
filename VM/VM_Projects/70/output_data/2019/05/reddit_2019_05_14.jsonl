A high short float is only good for those long a stock when there is a high probability of there being a news event revealing something that will, in the short-term, lead to material changes to a business\u2019s core financial metrics; a short squeeze only happens when shorts \u201cfold\u201d and cover their positions. This is unlikely to happen in the case of Tesla; I can assure you that Tesla is not being shorted by firms with weak hands, and there is, as of yet, no indication whatsoever that Tesla\u2019s claim of future profitability is anything but a mirage, even though they already seem to have scaled up production to levels sufficient to meet virtually all current demand and have already achieved many things they claimed would lead to an avalanche of demand (i.e. $30,000 model 3), which of course never materialized. Full self-driving capability (for any automaker) is likely decades away, and experts in the industry are almost unanimous in their agreement that FSD is unlikely to even be possible with current Tesla hardware, due to the absence of LIDAR. In any case, it\u2019s pretty widely accepted that Tesla\u2019s autonomous driving capabilities are not even close to being the most advanced in the industry; both Waymo and GM are believed to have a significant edge on Tesla in that arena. Their build quality is decidedly inferior when compared to other big automakers; look at the number of Teslas that are rejected upon delivery for paint damage, panel gapping, etc.  and then compare those numbers to those from an automaker like Honda. Additionally, the interior quality is inferior, in my experience, to that of other luxury brands like BMW and Mercedes, which have the same target market. Tesla\u2019s biggest hurdle, however, is that it has no enduring competitive moat in the EV or AV space, and will come under significant pressure in the next year or two when luxury automakers like Audi and BMW begin releasing mass-market luxury EVs. Overall, the kool-aid is believing that execution has been flawless, when it\u2019s been anything but; look over their 10Ks if you sincerely doubt that. And last quarter wasn\u2019t just \u201cbad,\u201d it was disastrous, especially given that Tesla was supposed to be turning a profit quarter after quarter beginning last year. I don\u2019t hate Tesla or hope that it goes under, and don\u2019t have any position in it.

Why would they be correct now?  They just keep moving the goal posts but at some point the numbers (growth, revenue, profit) will come to a head and they will have to scramble to cover.  All these dumbasses look for is quarter over quarter performance and can't even spot the technology trend and disruption.  Even worse they are \"investing\" on emotion now and claim fraud when their thesis gets busted.  With the type of technological sophistication these products have and the market disruption they are creating, this 40b valuation is a joke, especially when you look at revenues/revenue growth.  The fact is, this stock is being depressed and manipulated by wall st and hedge funds which makes this a fantastic opportunity for retailers that aren't emotional and can understand the game.  \n\nBut, let's just entertain that for the first time in their history, these TSLA bears are right.  Do you think there's no way that Elon finds another company that will buy them out?  Do you think he wouldn't pull from his vast resources and networks of friends and just let Tesla die?  Apple,with 200b cash and their own failing auto division, wouldn't buy them out?  Google, who tried once already, wouldn't try and buy their closest competitor in the self driving sector?  That's what I really don't understand.  I know these guys are short selling on emotion now but really, what is the actual upside here?  There is a huge list of companies willing to backstop TSLA for their tech and their brand and Elon is a magician at raising money.  So what is the end game here?

It is very common now to see 3 or 4 Teslas on any given drive if you're living on the coast (many more if in California).  Automakers are now tripping over themselves to catch up in the EV space.  Autopilot has changed the way people drive and those half a million cars (and growing) are training that software to be fully autonomous in the future.
