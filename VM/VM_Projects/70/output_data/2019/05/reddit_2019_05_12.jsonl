I believe most of their stock compensation is in the form of restricted stock units (RSU) which means  they are giving out a # of shares of amazon stock over a period of time for each employee. As the stock goes higher, the multiple becomes bigger and there are less options the individuals providing the compensation within the company. For example if AMZN is around $2000, then they are basically giving out stock compensation in multiples of $2000 which is fine, but what happens if it gets to $10000? In this case they would have to give each worker a minimum of $10,000 multiples per year.\n\nThey can provide the compensation in other forms but each form of compensation has different benefits and RSUs are very good.\n\nEDIT: I would also like to add that since a high percentage of an employee's compensation is in the form of stock compensation. They usually think they are getting X when they sign on, but as years pass this X becomes 2x and so on, which makes it impossible for them to leave amazon because they are getting paid so much more each year as the stock price appreciates. Due to this Bezos even when he splits, he will not split it to something like to $100 value. This is because he is interested in keeping the stock price not too volatile which would happen if the stock is priced in lower denominations. Too high of volatility would make it hard for him to keep his employees happy.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "That's true, but couldn't they always do what Google and BRK do and create a new stock at a lesser value, and use that as compensation or just entirely eliminate that program.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "GOOG and GOOGL are around the same price.

Even more so, during their reorganization, there is actually another class of shares that have 10x the voting power of one of the google shares that is not traded in the public market. I dont remember all the details so basically they did all of this to retain voting power instead of a regular split. \n\nThey would never eliminate the stock compensation program due to it is basically the biggest reason why Amazon is able to retain some of the best minds in the world.
