If Tesla is where they are today in two years with their autonomy, they probably wont make it but that will all be on their shoulders. Competition from European automakers won\u2019t be the reason Tesla fails and it doesn\u2019t worry me because, so far, it\u2019s clear they can\u2019t (or simply won\u2019t by choice) design an electric car properly. Example: e-tron with a 200 mile range. The largest automaker in the world couldn\u2019t do better than that with a 90kwh battery? What a fucking joke. As a past Audi driver, I\u2019m offended for them. Maybe range isn\u2019t everything for some people and that\u2019s fine but at a certain point it matters when the Model X has 60% more range.

Let\u2019s say 5 years after release they have 50k on the road worldwide. Is Porsche really going to build 5x 800v charger every 150 miles in every direction across Europe, China and North America? Maybe, but I\u2019d guess no seeing as how slow the Electrify America rollout has been and the fact that only one model of car will be able to use that speed for the first few years. What incentive does Porsche have to quickly build out the ultra-fast charging network? Maybe they\u2019ll only build them at Porsche dealerships which will work great for people who live nearby but won\u2019t work as well for long-distance travel. That will require a second car for any distance driving. Maybe they should look into Teslas.\n\nQuickly returning to the current status of AP: last week my car drove me 80 miles over an 1.5 hours (minus one toll booth because the traffic was crazy and I didn\u2019t want to test it) and then drove through an entire city in rush hour and I only took over when I had to make a turn off to my apartment.
