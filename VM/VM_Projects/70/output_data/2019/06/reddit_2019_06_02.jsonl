It was a small drink and he was a terrible customer to begin with, but his shirt looked like a normal $30 outlet polo. Maybe he really did _pay_ ten times that much, but does that mean it\u2019s worth that much? Well, a lot of people think things are worth what people are willing to pay, and while that\u2019s true, that\u2019s doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s always be worth that. If the dollar value is overinflated and housing is priced more than it\u2019d realistically be worth, all youd be doing is spending too much on a house. If the market bottom drops out, that house is going to tank in value but your loan/mortgage generally doesn\u2019t. Suddenly you\u2019re on the hook for a lot more than something is worth. What are you going to do, turnaround and sell it for what you bought it for? Not in a down market. Your house is suddenly worth $50,000 less. Taking out a mortgage is a very expensive and very long proposition. Considering incomes tend to drop in a recession/depression, a lot of people who maybe could just _barely_ pay their mortgage will now suddenly be unable to.

So China yuan downing (or devaluation of China currency to America currency, now about 4% down) affects more than $500 billions goods exported to USA, but new tariffs expected only affects $200 billions goods exported to USA.
