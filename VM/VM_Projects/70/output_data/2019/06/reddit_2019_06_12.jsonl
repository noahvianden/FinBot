If you pick somewhat decent strikes and are okay with the chances of your 100shares/contract getting eventually called away, then yes you can very easily make 2400/mo on credit premiums. Normally what I do is close the calls once I get around 50% or so profit, but that's just me.\n\nCovered calls are pretty much a win-win trade if you are okay with potentially selling your MSFT stocks. You keep the credit should the calls expire worthless and sell the stocks at whatever strike you pick should it expire in the money.\n\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/coveredcall.asp", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks! The only downside of covered calls is that if the stock shoots up way past your strike price, then you miss out on the potential gains and your gains are capped at your strike price right?\n\nIf you dont mind me asking, how far out do you usually set the strike price for 30days out? 5% more than current price?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Yes exactly. You miss out on potential gains, but if you were okay at selling MSFT at $135, then it's not that bad as you also received some credit to give you some additional gains. Say you received $2 per contract (options are 100 shares per contract, so $2*100=$200 credit). If MSFT falls below $135 at expiration, you keep the $200/contract and do it again. If MSFT expires ITM, by being $135.01 and above, at expiration, then you sell 100 shares of the stock per contract as well as keep the additional $200 per contract, making your theoretical break even point $137. If MSFT goes above 137.01, you theoretically could've made more money just holding the stock.\n\n\nAs for the strikes, 5% is a pretty good distance away OTM on the stock. It all depends on what you're comfortable potentially selling the stock at. MSFT moves pretty slowly, so if you do 5% OTM, then you may end up expiring worthless on the contracts and allowing you to keep the entire credit. I normally sell at 50% profit and roll up some more calls depending on the market sentiment. If I believe that MSFT is going to gain more, I'll hold off on selling covered calls and let the stock go up on its own. I'm pretty active with managing my positions, but you may be different and can come up with a different strategy depending on your views of the market.\n\nYou can also check out cash secured puts if you want to get into trading options for income like that. It's kinda similar but works backwards, so if you want to buy a stock, you can sell a put to receive credit. If the put expires worthless then you just keep the credit. If the contract goes ITM at expiration, you get assigned 100 shares/contract. It's a way to pick up shares at your preferred strike price while also receiving money while waiting to buy the stock at your preferred price. Obviously this ties up some money as you need money to buy the stocks should it be assigned, but it's a pretty good way to make a \"dividend\" while waiting to buy shares of Microsoft or whatever.\n\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/trading/introduction-to-put-writing/", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["msft", "msft"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6395430564880371}], "tickers": ["msft"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["msft"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["msft", "tsla", "nvda"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["msft"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Can\u2019t argue with that.
