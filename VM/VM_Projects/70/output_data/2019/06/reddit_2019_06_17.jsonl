However, some stocks are safer than others.\n\nCRM is one of the safest because it has yet to recover to even close to its post earnings level, which was a great earnings report. The double whammy of unrelated antitrust news (which arguably affects FB more than anyone and look at them) and the DATA acquisition pushed the stock down. It has been consolidating for a week, being accumulated, and it's nearly ready to take off to near its old levels in the 160s.\n\nA more conservative estimate is mid 150s, which I think could be the extent of its short term recovery, but am leaning more towards high 150s low 160s recovery over the next week.

We've heard the \"90% done with trade deal\" line before and last time after the meeting there was a massive selloff because tensions escalated (I lost big that time believing a deal would be made). Same thing could happen again, China too proud and stubborn. Trump won't bend ever. China can wait it all out and maybe Trump loses election. Lots can happen. That's why I've been out of the market this week except a few small plays. \n\nOnce more is known it'll be a lot easier to find plays, so I'm waiting for that, knowing that there is a possibility of a deal, in which case I'll miss out on the first day of the rally that will result, but I'd rather that than be majorly negative from holding too much. And if everything drops after meeting, there will be plenty of opportunities.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5989577174186707}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6136597990989685}], "tickers": ["crm"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.7028255462646484}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5870472192764282}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2771267890930176}, {"body": "[New to options so thanks for the tip!](https://imgur.com/IdntTN6)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "You're welcome", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3012276291847229}, {"body": "bro what's it look like now hah", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "[Bro I sold early lol](https://imgur.com/EOdvNJQ)", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "No shame in those gains!
