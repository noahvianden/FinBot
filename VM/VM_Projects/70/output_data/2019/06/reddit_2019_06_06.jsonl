It is bullish if they are doing it because all the sales are done, and it is now just a delivery exercise. They save money and there is a great quarter ahead.\n\n2. it is bearish if they are doing it because they are short on cash and they hope that sales can come in online.  Now, if one believes sales people are barnacles and not needed, it may still be bullish to them. But if one believes that sales people are needed to close the gap in sales and get people over the edge, one would view it as bearish.\n\nSecondly, an event can be bullish but also be bearish depending on the \"why\" .  For instance, I think it is generally good to pay salespeople to push product, so doing that is a bullish thing since it should help sales. However, if you are providing a new incentive with double bonuses because sales are awful and conversion rates are a lot lower, then that is a bearish sign about sales.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "So if you assume the worst interpretation of why they are doing everything without any proof of it being so, than it is always bearish, no matter what they're doing.
