At the age of 19 years old he assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria and his wife, Sophie, in Sarajevo on 28 June 1914, initiating a chain of events that would lead to the outbreak of World War I. Princip and his accomplices were arrested and implicated the Serbian nationalist secret society known as the Black Hand, leading Austria-Hungary to issue a d\u00e9marche to Serbia known as the July Ultimatum.Princip said the archduke was targeted because \"as future Sovereign he would have prevented our union by carrying through certain reforms\", an allusion to the archduke's reputed support for structural reforms of the monarchy that would assign more autonomy to the Slavic lands. This was a threat to the Serbian irredentist project. \n\nPrincip was a Yugoslav nationalist associated with the movement Mlada Bosna (Young Bosnia) which predominantly consisted of Serbs, but also Bosniaks and Croats.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": ["pm"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Pretty sure his name is common knowledge though.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah that guy was basically quoting Dan Carlin when plenty of people know about him", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4595333933830261}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.48510631918907166}, {"body": "Desktop link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavrilo_Princip\n***\n ^^/r/HelperBot_ ^^Downvote ^^to ^^remove. ^^Counter: ^^264618.
