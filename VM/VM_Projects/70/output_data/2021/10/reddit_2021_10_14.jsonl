They claim they are targeting to pay market value, charging a 5-6% fee + repairs. If it costs them 4% in transfer fees and selling fees, they make 1-2% delta.

You don\u2019t have to deal with Reno, updates, staging, people walking through your home, etc. This is appealing to many sellers. As a Realtor myself, I still think the current Realtor method is better and will net more unless they are taking losses. There will likely be price compression on commissions and less agents doing more volume to compete with Z. Eventually if margin gets squeezed, iBuyers won\u2019t have much success as they are running on such thin margins to start with and the cost to buy and sell is expensive with taxes having to be paid on both sides. \n\nThere is also accusations that they are trying to buy homes in an area, then buy a few at higher prices to jack up comps in the area to make a profit.
