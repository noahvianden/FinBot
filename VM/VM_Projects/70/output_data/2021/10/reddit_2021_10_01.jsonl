{"title": "Small Account (scalping trader) *Update (4)* - I BLEW UP", "selftext": "This is a follow-up on my small account challenge I started to share with the public on 8/24/21 (initial reddit post available [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/ph6gjf/is_this_scalping_style_sustainable_in_the/). Update 2 post is available [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/pln76c/small_account_scalping_trader_weekly_update_2/). Update 3 post available [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/pq3qvu/small_account_scalping_trader_weekly_update_3/).\n\n**Before I start the actual post: A VERY BIG TIP to anyone who is just now reading this, please take the time to go over the previous posts by reading the actual post along with all comments if possible. Most questions you may have will most likely have been answered already in some kind of form.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6q5g5wb9ivq71.png?width=766&format=png&auto=webp&s=673cf9abb57424f7b312b3f8265a3a5c3e303227\n\nI want to focus more on this post by sharing **my own trading rules**, and give a little more guidance on how to approach trading (or at least the way I personally like to scalp trade).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDown to the formalities first: As you can see, I took a few trades since my last update.\n\nAnother [proof](https://i.imgur.com/7L55cdt.png) for those who aren't as strong and need \"validation\" for their own trading performance. You can always blame other people or other factors in your life, but UNTIL THE MOMENT YOU REALIZE and UNDERSTAND/ACCEPT that it's all on you, you won't make it far in what we all like to call \"trading\".\n\nI intentionally used \"BLEW UP\" in the post title. Hehe. I mean, I did literally blow up the account, on a positive note :) . I just gotta have some fun with trading or making these types of reddit posts online sometimes. I also did take a few losing trades and some days even ended in the red. Small red days do not personally bother me. I view trading as a game that has no actual end goal. The ultimate reason or motivation is to be in this game forever, growing your profits AND experience over time.\n\nYes, I admit it would have been nice to boast with a 90+ win rate accuracy for a little bit longer, but on a grand scheme of things, the important part is to be able to illustrate consistency and to be overall profitable over a long time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm up approx. $3,121 on my (rounded up) $2,500 account. That means I'm up 124.8% on the account 6 weeks into this publicly shared journey. On average you can say I basically made somewhere around $520 per week from scalp trading. I've provided plenty of screenshots (Tradersync - journaling system) to give you a better idea of my personal trading style.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWill this continue? I don't know the answer to that.\n\nWhat I do know is that I love this style of trading. I also know that I don't have a problem taking losing trades, let alone stop trading after a small losing trade only to \"close\" the day in the red.\n\nEgo, overconfidence and most importantly wrong mindset can and will cause you to lose in this game. Any trader, who can understand that, can be in this game forever. I view this as part of having a trading edge.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe reaction I received from the community, especially after POST 3, was very overwhelming. I have tried my best to keep up with questions, answering, and spending some additional extra time on reddit chat requests where possible. Some asked about my OWN trading rules, so I thought I'd take the time with this update to share them and hope that you can make all, some or none part of your own or refine based on your own needs. I repeat these rules to myself every day, especially before entering my first trade of the day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**- Trade small and accumulate experience/profits over time**\n\n**- Pay yourself frequently**\n\n**- When realizing losing trade, ask yourself if you truly want to continue trading for the day**\n\n**- If you feel the need to continue trading, scale back to 1-lot trades (see rule #1 if you will)**\n\n**- Trade what you see, not what can or will be**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat's it. Simple right? Just like trading should be. Takes very little time to go over these rules each day in the morning. They keep me sharp with having a proper mindset. They make me not enter the market with a directional bias. I don't know if these rules will help you in any way. I just know they help me. Each and every day pretty much. The rest comes from trading experience and having a large number of completed trades in your reservoir.\n\nIf you have traded the past 6 weeks, you probably know how easy or difficult it was. Trading in itself is actually easy, the mechanics that is. The difficult part is to follow your trading plan. If you cannot follow it you may as well take time working on those things while trading small to continue your learning curve/experience. That learning curve that you start to acquire by having plenty of screen time, should mirror the consistency and profitability over time. It should steadily be in an up-trend. There is nothing wrong with taking your time. I mean it. You don't need to rush or aim for home-run trades. They will happen every so often. You need to focus on sticking to that plan (accept losing trades when they do occur) and live to trade another day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am including some screenshots of my [NFLX](https://i.imgur.com/I7nfyI3.png), [NVDA](https://i.imgur.com/FQYhv4p.png) and as a [bonus AAPL](https://i.imgur.com/X6DmcfQ.png) chart. Look at all three of them and honestly ask yourself what you see (these same thoughts I do have when I glance at each of these charts for a split second before deciding if there is a trading opportunity or not). I added AAPL to the list even though I didn't trade it today because I feel I missed out on it. It's no big deal, I still made plenty off NFLX and NVDA for the time spent in my trades, but I thought it might serve you greatly as another example.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIs it up trending?\n\nIs it down trending?\n\nHow small or large are the candles?\n\nIf a strong candle is taken out on the next candle (learn engulfing candles if you want), do I want to be part of a potential trading opportunity? If so, how large of a position/risk do I want to enter on this trade?\n\nCan I be wrong?\n\nHow can I be wrong? Candle immediately canceling each other out would be confirmation for you to BAIL on the trade for instance. There is no need to hold and pray for reversal. You have the power to enter a trade, and you have the power to exit a trade. This is what's great for retail traders. Large institutions have a little bit more trouble moving large amounts of capital around on their positions. You just, as a retail trader, simply want to be part of a larger move and be on the right side. BUT remember, if price action tells you you're wrong, you follow your trading plan and exit and wait for another opportunity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis week alone confirmed my trading style again to me on a personal level. I can have losing trades as long as I accept them in a proper way. I can still end up profitable for the week which is my ultimate goal. Looking back at all the trades in the past 6 weeks on this account, the losing trades DO not matter or bother me. You need to view trading as a long-term game. You want to boost your trading confidence by gaining that trading experience (both winning trades AND losing trades alike) so you can look forward to the next months and years of trading.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nu5b858civq71.png?width=763&format=png&auto=webp&s=39720b3b52db73d42036abebc4410f9579870e92\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/csxl570divq71.png?width=1145&format=png&auto=webp&s=a5b327cd06201fc204c54ddc689939a71f2c7846\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nvhxvtudivq71.png?width=918&format=png&auto=webp&s=eac522ef2b6c937e7acc3123416883dd8f5dab96", "id": "pzcsf2", "created_utc": 1633109203.0, "score": 191, "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "num_comments": 75, "comments": [{"body": "We\u2019re all very impressed you made some money over a six week period.", "score": 98, "replies": [{"body": "lol.

They are. They can't have margin, so they are cash accounts. \n  \nI think you're getting Pattern Day Trading rules confused with free-riding prohibitions. In a cash account, you can't buy and then sell with **unsettled cash**. You have to wait T+2 days for equities and T+1 for options to \"settle\".

You do 10 $100 stock trades and turn that into $1100 in one day. You buy $1,100 of SPY that day. You have to wait 2 more days before you can sell the SPY. \n  \nOr if you do 10 $100 option trades and turn that into $1100. You buy $1,100 of SPY.

{"title": "How Zillow, Redfin and Opendoor manipulate the single family residential/house market", "selftext": "TLDR: They are damn smart, will cause house prices to rise, but I'm not Michael Burry autismo yet to bet against any of them.\n\nTLDR2: They buy a few key houses, artificially inflate the price, borrow against that asset, use that collateral as more cash, and buy more houses in strategic areas. It's like fractional reserve banking but with houses.\n\nI trade mortgage backed securities. Actually nah, I'm just a real estate agent and I'm salty. Actually I am a teller at a money center bank and I say I'm an investment banker on Tinder. But actually I just give BJs behind your local Wendy's. You can trust me.\n\nZillow, Redfin and Opendoor has been involved in buying single family homes for the past 2 years now. Buying a house for 200k and then flipping for 250k, believe it or not, is not the main way their single family house business makes money. Of course they want prices to go up, but they do it in a much more strategic way.\n\nWhen Zillow (this is the prime example I will use going forward) wants to develop a market, they will go out and offer higher bids. You can almost preview which markets they want to get into by comparing their Zestimate with either the local tax appraisal amount (for areas where appraisals are annual like TX) or recently sold records (like CA). They will bid around 20% higher for around a portfolio of 5-10 strategic houses.\n\nAfter they buy the initial portfolio of 5-10 strategic houses, they will place maybe 1 or 2 for sale. Fixing it up is optional. These houses will be near or higher than the local average, because they are playing with data. In Austin, where hot houses near market price sell within 5 days, Zillow houses often are on the market for 2-4 weeks. They don't need to sell it, and often don't want to because they are creating a data point.\n\nSo what happens with that 50% marked up house? A withdrawn listing is not good for both the house in the future (people may wonder if there are structural or physical problems) and not good for the area (no bids). They simply buy it back using one of their smaller funded vehicles. Because they have their own realtors, the transaction cost is minimal and much less than what happens next for them to make money. Great, now that previous house which cost $1 million has sold for $1.5 million. Everyone sees that because it's public record.\n\nWith that freshly minted $1.5 million record, they are able to raise the estimates of the other houses of the 5-10 initial purchases by around 50%. Do they sell those houses? Well no, because as we've seen, there are no bids at that inflated price. They take that appraisal record, and go ask for a loan from whoever wants to invest in their real estate-backed vehicle (mostly Blackrock and by extension a bunch of pension funds).\n\nSo that house they originally bought for $1 million, now has a public and documented value of $1.5 million. For Zillow, they can get around 80% LTV, so $1.5\\*80% = $1.2 million in new cash. What do they do? They take the cash to a new area, buy up new houses and the cycle continues.\n\nIs there a problem with this? I ain't no commie and I already have my own shack so I don't have any complaints. Will there be a problem? Well, what if values start to decrease? Well, apart from the 2008 blip, real estate prices in the US have always gone up. That's what everyone said until they were punched in the face. If there is going to be a decrease in demand (more rentals, or as old people start dying off and leaving houses to their kids) or supply or everyone deciding to move out of the shithole that is San Francisco and Los Angeles, you'd expect houses to go down. If the house price decreases to maybe around 50% LTV, there may be margin calls.\n\nSo essentially, it might be a repeat of 2008. This time, Fannie/Freddie/Ginnie have been replaced by Blackrock and a bunch of private funds (post 2008, a large part of the foreclosed houses were owned by Fannie/Freddie and sold off one by one). The average American borrower has been replaced by Zillow/Redfin/Opendoor. The only difference this time is that the numbers are bigger, and Zillow/Redfin/Opendoor for how has a magic money machine called local price manipulation.", "id": "pzat03", "created_utc": 1633103429.0, "score": 137, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 79, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|255|**First Seen In WSB**|3 years ago\n**Total Comments**|233|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f94hy6/the_case_for_ccl_puts/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fi7g5p/did_your_calls_and_puts_decay_today_the_case_for/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fvj571/zoom_communications_and_the_chinese_government/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fwl0kt/5000_on_essentially_a_zm_yolo_70p_821/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mavkie/treasury_issuance_calendar_for_the_next_week_and/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f5epon/csco_dd/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f8t24f/my_last_play_ccl_puts/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwln2x/vale_iron_ore_infrastructure_inflation_and_brazil/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n8urkv/corn_gang_good_weather_is_coming_farmers_are/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dyu02b/deck_decker_outdoors_is_the_holy_grail_in_becky/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4nyn3/dissecting_why_gme_went_up_so_bigly_and_is_the/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n48yea/corn_ethanol_demand_lack_of_supply_odd_weather/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4sb4t/dissecting_why_gme_went_up_so_bigly_and_is_the/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lwlrvj/dis_the_ultimate_postpandemic_play/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fd9lss/the_end_of_globalization_and_rise_of_teleworking/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fdnlp8/the_case_for_selling_puts_msft_150p_june/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mrj8si/cattle_futures_buy_the_dip/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mid1ih/nfps_tomorrow_and_the_treasuries_market_tlt_govt/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lchkzz/ford_its_a_data_company_now/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pzat03/how_zillow_redfin_and_opendoor_manipulate_the/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m5p2r2/disney_the_all_in_one_stop_recovery_stock/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/csk2vz/buy_spyqqq_sell_ea/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lig3lx/bmbl_i_hate_the_stock/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e4xvg5/costco_china_dd/) \n**Account Age**|4 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=pzat03)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=pzat03)\n    \nHey /u/1poundbookingfee, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I just have 1 FD for QQQ 359 that I'm 50% down on. \n\nhttps://imgur.com/NZVkMnc", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3088693618774414}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4362543523311615}, {"body": "I'm in real estate but also give BJ's behind the Wendy's too.
