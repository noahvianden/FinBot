(All well known facts)\n\nBut here is why you should look past all that, and adding more AMZN to your portfolio will payoff big time. If you look closely in their earnings report, they are spending like crazy in their logistic business this also includes last mile delivery and EV investment.\n\nThis is a company that generates revenue of over $400B a year, as soon as they make their operation more efficient and spending drops. Its going to generate amazing profit. \n\nOn top of this their selfdriving division Zoox is now running Level 3 autonomous in seattle and announcing project kuiper partnership with verizon. And ofc AWS is still growing over 30% which is nuts since they are already a market leader. \n\nBottomline is AMZN has lot of things going for at the moment and lot of catalyst can send this stock to moon.
