{"title": "The Greeks 101: Delta and Gamma", "selftext": "# The Greeks\n\nThe \u201cGreeks\u201d are a series of factors that help options traders understand and predict what will happen to the price of an option. It\u2019s worth understanding what factors impact price movements. As usual, I\u2019ll try to breakdown the basics. This post is meant for beginners, not experienced options traders.\n\n# Delta\n\n**Delta** \u2013 Measures the rate of change of an options premium based on the directional movement of the underlying asset.\n\n>When the price of the underlying asset increases, the options price does too.\n\nThe Delta of an option helps traders predict and understand by how many points the option premium will change for every 1-point change in price of the underlying asset.\n\nDelta can be either positive or negative depending on the option type. Delta can also be used as an approximation of probability that an option will end up at least $0.01 in-the-money (profitable) at expiration.\n\n* **Call Options have a positive delta**, between 0 and 1 (or 0 to 100).\n* **Put Options have a negative delta**, between 0 and -1. (-100 to 0).\n\n# Gamma:\n\nAs we learned, the Delta of an option is a **variable**. It changes each time the **premium** or **price** of an underlying asset **moves**. The Gamma of an option **measures the rate of change of the options delta.**\n\nGamma is the **change in delta** caused by **every 1-point change in price of the underlying asset.** Much like delta, gamma is a variable, effected by even the smallest movements.\n\nThe gamma\u2019s range depends on how \u201cin the money\u201d an option is.\n\n* The more **in the money**, or **out of the money** the option is, the **lower** the gamma.\n* The closer the option is to being **at the money**, **the** higher the gamma.\n\n# Calculating New Options Price\n\nThanks to /u/MichaelBurryScott I know have a better understanding of the methodology behind calculating new option price using delta and gamma.\n\nSince delta is a derivative of an option and it changes through gamma you can only use it to estimate options pricing with small price moves in the underlying asset, a few points at most.\n\nTo calculate larger moves, you need to combine the delta and gamma effect.\n\nYou can use the equations of motion with constant acceleration where delta is your speed, gamma is your acceleration, the options price is your distance and time being the underlying assets price.\n\n>New Option Price = Old Option Price + Delta \\* Underlying Asset Change + 0.5 \\* Gamma \\* (Underlying Asset Change)**^(2)**\n\n# Call Options:\n\nThe delta of call options is positive and ranges from 1 to 0 (100 to 0). **When the price of the underlying asset increases, the option price increases.**\n\n**Example 1:** AMD\u2019s current share price is $80. You look at a call option with a:\n\n* $95 strike price\n* $10 premium\n* Delta = 0.3\n* Gamma = 0.0025\n* The price of the underlying asset increases to $120, resulting in a 40-point change.\n\n>New Options Price = 10 + 0.3 \\* 40 + 0.5 \\* 0.0025 \\* (40)**^(2)**  **= $24**\n\n**Example 2:** AMD\u2019s current share price is $85. You look at a call option with a:\n\n* $95 strike price\n* $10 premium\n* Delta = 0.3\n* Gamma = 0.0025\n* The price of the underlying asset decreases to $65, resulting in a -20-point change.\n\n>New Options Price = 10 + 0.3 \\* -20 + 0.5 \\* 0.0025 \\* (-20)**^(2)**  **= $4.5**\n\n# Put Options:\n\nThe delta of put options is negative and ranges from -1 to 0 (-100 to 0). When the **price of the underlying asset increases, the option price decreases.**\n\n**Example 1:** AMD\u2019s current share price is $85. You look at a put option with a:\n\n* $95 strike price\n* $10 premium\n* Delta = -0.3\n* Gamma = 0.0025\n* The price of the underlying asset decreases to $60, resulting in a -25-point change.\n\n>New Options Price = 10 + -0.3 \\* -25 + 0.5 \\* 0.0025 \\* (-25)**^(2)**  **= $18.28**\n\n**Example 2:** AMD\u2019s current share price is $85.

{"title": "BBBY gain porn and DD", "selftext": " \n\nOk apes, chimps, gorillas, primates of all stripes... I'm going to level with you. I am posting this mainly because I want to throw one of my best ideas into the ring. But that's not the only reason I am writing this. I also want to inspire those of you who are just getting started in this game. For those who say that retail investors can't consistently make money in markets, I present you with some recent gain porn for your viewing pleasure. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gyvyzp0yln371.png?width=1355&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf56089ae7e9cff017cacdc546e9aa3c9e55f329\n\nLook, I won't lie, making money investing is not easy -- lots of smart people are trying to do the same thing. But the real challenge is having the emotional resilience to stick with your thesis, and while not easy, if you stick to basic math and only invest in what you know, it is simple. \n\nAs retail investors, we have a huge advantage over the big guys on Wall Street who need to hug the benchmarks, satisfy investor demands for quarterly results and invest only where they can expect to generate acceptable \"risk-adjusted\" returns where risk is bizarrely defined as \"volatility\", instead of permanent impairment of capital, which is how I see it. \n\nWe can arbitrage these structural weaknesses in institutional portfolio management by making contrarian bets on stocks that are currently out of favor with the big guys, provided we've done our homework on the business and believe that it is undervalued. Eventually, if we are right about the trajectory of the business, they will eventually be forced to buy us out at a huge premium when the results prove out and herd mentality kicks back in the other way. \n\nI've made a nice chunk of coin on several positions over the last few years, which has enabled me to make bigger investments, and I am currently up materially on my latest portfolio positions. These are positions I have held for long time periods, with Bed Bath and Beyond being the largest position, the longest held and highest percentage gains. In my view, it also has the most upside, so I want to share a bit more with you about my thesis.\n\n**Nothing I've said or am about to say should be construed in any way as investment advice.** **This is just me sharing my YOLO, with an explanation for my thesis.** \n\nBed Bath and Beyond was a successful business when it first arrived on the scene, practically creating and defining the concept of Big Box Retail. As so often happens in life, their huge initial success bred complacency, and the co-founders (Warren Eisenberg and Leonard Feinstein) who continued presiding over the Board basically ran the company like it was their private piggy bank, without regard for small (or even large) shareholders. \n\nUnder the leadership of Steven Temares, the CEO they handpicked, the business failed to innovate and keep up with basic changes taking place in retail -- such as the rise of e-commerce. BBBY began to see online giants like Amazon and even brick & mortar mass merchants like Target and Lowes begin to eat their lunch. Steven Temares, along with the rest of the c-suite, continued to receive huge salaries and bonuses, while the two co-founders received generous perks like personal black-car chauffer services, all paid for by the company -- and therefore, shareholders. \n\nThey also refused to answer basic questions posited by Wall Street research analysts on earnings calls, seeing the investment community essentially as a nuisance to be tolerated but not proxies for the true owners of the business -- public investors. \n\nWell, the situation got so bad that finally, circa mid-2019 in the year of our chimp lord, a trifecta of activist investors led by Legion Partners (founder was trained by legendary activist Nelson Peltz) and John Duskin at Macellum Capital decided to wage war, buying up \\~6% of the stock and filing a 170 white paper detailing all of the problems with how the company was being run and proposing to replace the entire Board of Directors and management team with its own slate of nominees. The presentation, which is phenomenal, is posted here:\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/886158/000092189519001180/ex1dfan14a09050028_04262019.pdf\n\nThey went so far as to create a website for their campaign, [restorebedbath.com](https://restorebedbath.com/), which they eventually dismantled after reaching a cooperation and settlement agreement with the Board of Directors. This agreement effectively ceded control to the activists, who proceeded to replace everyone. It was a real Red Wedding style bloodbath... I mean total scorched earth policy... no respect for life. While it's never pleasant seeing people get canned, these people deserved it. After years and years of unaccountable shareholder abuse, someone finally came along and pulled out the game cartridge, blew on it and hit \"reset\" on the console. And they saw that it was good. \n\nIn November 2019 they announced Mark Tritton, legendary Chief Merchandising Officer from Target who was the main person responsible for their massive success in developing private label / owned brand programs, would be taking the helm as CEO. Since taking charge, Mark has consistently been executing on the playbook laid out by the activists in their white paper, which basically calls for making low risk / high return changes to bring Bed Bath and Beyond up to modern retailing standards using well established best practices. \n\nWhile some would argue that a turnaround of this magnitude carries high execution risk, I would disagree at this time for several reasons: (1) The changes they have been making are actually quite well established strategies for modern retailing, with loads of case studies to pull from (Best Buy, Target, Lowes, etc); (2) they have the best team you could ask for implementing these changes (i.e., Mark Tritton and John Hartmann, who became COO of BBBY after a highly successful run as CEO of True Value hardware chains); (3) their compensation is heavily geared towards stock compensation, so **they only win if we all win;** and (4) most of the highest risk action plans, like divesting of non-core assets, culling unproductive / unprofitable stores, reducing bloated headcount and liquidating stale inventories at reasonable valuations, are all in the rear-view mirror. \n\nAs of June 2021, Bed Bath and Beyond is at an inflection point with a strong focus on driving profitable growth from its core business lines. This comes down to a few very important strategies: (1) focusing on digital first, omni-always capabilities (leading with the website and mobile app but making sure they are able to serve customers however, whenever and wherever they want to shop -- think curbside pick-up, same-day delivery and buy-online pick-up in store aka BOPIS); (2) focusing on key destination categories where the company is seen as an authority in the home, driving preference for BBBY over other chains and even national brands by defining its key categories using data and developing owned brands to fill out their assortment in those areas (they have launched 6 so far this year, with another 4 expected by end of year -- ultimately they expect 30% of their sales to come from the brands they have created). This will help help them in multiple ways. First, the products are only going to be available at BBBY, so they are re-establishing their authority in the home and preference for BBBY as a brand and not just a venue to shop other manufacturers' products (this also means these items can't be bought online except for thru BBBY, so it is Amazon defense playbook 101). Second, these products have been strategically developed in areas where they had gaps in their assortment relative to the competitors they were losing share to. As mentioned above, development of these brands was informed by **data**, including detailed line reviews and purchasing data. Third, and final, these products are designed to cost and have very healthy margins that should improve the overall margin profile of the business as they are rolled out. This fireside chat with Mark Tritton from January 2021 explains it all far better than I can, and is well worth watching for curious apes: \n\n[https://www.npd.com/wps/portal/npd/us/news/videos/a-fireside-chat-with-mark-tritton-president-and-ceo-of-bed-bath-and-beyond/](https://www.npd.com/wps/portal/npd/us/news/videos/a-fireside-chat-with-mark-tritton-president-and-ceo-of-bed-bath-and-beyond/)\n\n**So where does this all leave us today?**\n\nThe company has successfully implemented its digital first, omni-always capabilities, rolling out BOPIS, curbside pickup and same-day delivery (just signed up deals with Instacart & Doordash). Digital sales were up 86% in the most recent quarter and 99% in the Bed Bath banner (they also own Buy Buy Baby, which is the largest national baby retail chain in the US with the bankruptcy of Babies R US -- this alone makes BBBY an interesting investment with tons of hidden value).\n\nFor the first time in **years**, the company began posting positive same-store sales for the last 3 quarters under Mark Tritton (consistently comping up in the mid-single digits). This is a very positive sign of the changes taking place already. Same-store sales metrics are probably the most important data point for retailers, as it basically tells you if consumers think they have a good reason to exist. Quite frankly, it is an extraordinary achievement by Mark and his team that after years of declining same-store sales they are now positive for 3 consecutive quarters, and I don't think this has gotten enough attention.\n\nThey have also begun launching their new owned brands, with 6 already launched and another 4 or so on the way this year. These brands have a strong focus on their top 5 destination categories (bedding, bath, kitchen & food prep, indoor decor, and organization) -- I've personally purchased and used these products, and they are excellent quality at reasonable price points. I think they will do great.\n\nThey are repurchasing $1bn of their own stock (at least $375mm completed so far at an average price of \\~$23 per share, reducing their share count from \\~126mm to \\~109mm.\n\nNormalizing their revenues for divested brands and culling of unprofitable / lowest productivity stores in their footprint, management has guided to \\~$8.2bn of sales and $525mm of EBITDA **this year,** with sales comping up in the low- to mid-single digits range for the next several years and EBITDA margins improving to high single digits / low double digits resulting in EBITDA of $850mm-$1bn by YE 2023.\n\nApplying simple mathematics and established standards of value, I believe the evidence shows that businesses in this industry (big box and specialty retail) would typically be valued at \\~8-12x EBITDA which would imply an enterprise value (value of the whole business, not just the equity) of \\~$9bn at the midpoint, which seems eminently reasonable for an iconic retailer under solid leadership with about 1000 stores and authority in key growing segments of the US economy.\n\nSince they have virtually the same amount of cash as debt, the enterprise value should be about the same as the equity value, so \\~$9bn at the midpoint above. With \\~109mm shares outstanding today, that puts implied equity value per share at \\~$82, but where it gets even more interesting is if you factor in the share buybacks. They've still got $625mm of remaining authorized share repurchases under their existing program, and depending on how cheap they are able to buy those shares they could materially reduce the share count further.\n\n**So why are the big institutional investors continuing to ignore this stock? Why does everyone continue to ignore the insanely cheap valuation and upside potential under the extraordinary new leadership of Mark Tritton, John Hartmann and the rest of the new team?** \n\nI can think of several possibilities, but probably the main one is a backward looking bias, because the memory of the old management team and their awful performance dies hard. Their prolonged period of value destruction also gave rise to a narrative, parroted widely by thematic investors and talking heads on CNBC, basically a nonsense theory that all brick & mortar would die and the consumer would only ever want to shop at Amazon (somehow ignoring blatantly contradictory evidence provided by Target, Lowes, Walmart, etc). \n\nIn this excellent interview with burgeoning hedge fund manager Dan McMurtrie (aka Supermugatu), he discusses the reality of how Amazon is killing bad retail, not all retail, and how certain investors / the media have taken the the idea way too far as they so often love to do. **I cannot recommend this highly enough -- well worth watching beginning at 39:45.**\n\n[https://www.realvision.com/unmasking-supermugatu-how-the-pros-find-edge](https://www.realvision.com/unmasking-supermugatu-how-the-pros-find-edge)\n\nIt might take some time for BBBY to shake off the worries created during the former management team's tenure. Most of the time, the stock market is forward looking, but in this case investors have adopted a thesis that has them psychologically stuck in the past due to PTSD, and the distractions in rear-view mirror are blinding them to what is likely to happen in the next 6, 12, 18 months. \n\nEventually, I personally expect BBBY to shock the market with positive results one of these quarters, forcing a rapid, seemingly unexpected valuation revision in the stock. They have already begun to put up excellent numbers, if you look at the underlying same-store sales, digital growth, growth in top 5 destination categories, for example. However, there has still been a lot of noise in the numbers from divestitures, culling of store footprint, COVID impact in 2020, etc., and it appears that perception has not caught up yet with the new reality.\n\nWhile I haven't focused on it much here, the company also has an excellent balance sheet with over $1bn of cash, no meaningful near-term debt maturities, solidly positive free cash flow generation & very high short interest.\n\nEven with all of the prevailing negative sentiment, this has been a profitable investment for me so far (I purchased heavily in periods where others abandoned hope over the last few years). In my opinion, the company is probably worth about $80 / share as of today, however with continued solid execution and more enthusiasm coming back into the name, I could see this valued well into the triple digits. \n\nSo, even with my sizeable gains I haven't sold one share and don't plan to anytime soon.
