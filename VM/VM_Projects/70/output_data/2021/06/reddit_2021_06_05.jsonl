{"title": "Work Horse DD", "selftext": "**With the growing talk about a potential Work Horse short squeeze I looked into the company and here's what I think about it, and why I bought: TLDR at bottom**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere is a TLDR after each section for more in depth details. Or a very broad TLDR at end.\n\n# The Drone (CON)\n\n1. \"Horse Fly\" is Work Horses last mile delivery drone launched from their delivery vehicle. Sounds great in theory and this is exactly what we expected the future to hold, right? Sure. As a consumer though do you really want your package to be dropped in your [front yard](https://youtu.be/05BaPqBXNT0?t=207) and have to walk to pick up your package or have a person put in literally in front of your door? A loud drone is also a huge \"HEY COME STEAL MY PACKAGE\" alarm.\n   1. \"Horse Fly\" Me, the OP, being a student Pilot, I knew about airspaces and can Horse Fly even fly in the majority of US Airspace? Turns out they actually can, they claim on their website they have worked with the FAA to obtain permission which is a major PRO. As stated on their website: **\"The HorseFly system is designed to conform to the FAA guidelines for UAV operation in the U.S. \"**\n      1. However, you cannot really use this system in any densely populated area (like new york) for the simple fact you don't want drones flying around 10lb packages above thousands of humans heads all day. That's a lawsuit begging to happen.\n2. The drone is limited to a 10lb payload, this even further reduces the actual amount of packagesit will be able to deliver. Ultimately this drone is pretty fucking useless as it's only use is in very sparsely populated areas or small suburban areas.\n\n(1) **Tl;dr:**\n\nThe drones cannot be utilized everywhere in the USA, which greatly restricts their abilities considering the [majority of the US population lives in just a few different locations](http://ecpmlangues.u-strasbg.fr/civilization/geography/maps/US%20Population%20density,%202010.png) anywhere dark red would likely be unable for this drone. Drones are maintenance heavy and seem to still require human intervention. I just cant see the ultimate viability of drones compared to a human. Would be loud and attract thieves, and annoy customers.\n\n# Continued Revenue (CON)\n\n2.How will Work Horse continue to make money after i.e UPS buys all the trucks they want? Obviously UPS is not interested in buying the newest model every year, which means no new revenue for Work Horse. So what about maintenance? It appears as though Work Horse contracts out maintenance through Ryder Systems. [https://ryder.com/locations](https://ryder.com/locations). This would imply Work Horse will not be making money from maintenance.\n\n1. Drone Maintenance? I haven't found anything on their website about this, but would it really be worth it for UPS to have to be constantly shipping these drones back to Work Horse for repairs and needing to keep extra drones on hand and constantly accessible? Or just pay a driver who is significantly more reliable?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(2) **Tl;dr:**\n\nTheres **no real potential for continued revenue** after workhorse sells a company their initial fleet, workhorse wont be the ones doing maintenance and the customer company wont be interested in a new fleet of the newest model each year.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Charging Costs (CON)\n\n[reuters.com](https://reuters.com) Did an article about workhorse charging costs. **\"Developing the battery plants and charging infrastructure to fund an electrified global vehicle fleet could require an investment of $2.7 trillion by manufacturers and governments \".**  Workhorse does not have anywhere near the required capital to build charging stations, which would likely leave the cost for UPS to cover. Not to mention EV doesn't change a god damn thing, we will create the electricity for the EV's by burning coal LOL [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ups-workhorse-group-electric-vehicles/ups-workhorse-electric-van-deal-shows-progress-on-charging-costs-idUSKCN1G61RZ](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ups-workhorse-group-electric-vehicles/ups-workhorse-electric-van-deal-shows-progress-on-charging-costs-idUSKCN1G61RZ)\n\n(3) T**l;dr** Infrastructure required will likely be so significantly expensive that the cost would never be recouped over any realistic time frame from the money being saved between electricity and petroleum costs by a customer company (like UPS). Besides, electricity on this size scale will be significantly more expensive than petroleum which just means you're consistently losing money by switching to an EV fleet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Why Q4 FY 2020 Was so high (CON)\n\n\" **Sales for the fourth quarter of 2020 were recorded at $652,000 compared to $3,000 in the fourth quarter of 2019. The increase in sales was due to a higher volume of trucks produced and delivered.** \" [https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/03/01/2184359/0/en/Workhorse-Group-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2020-Results.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/03/01/2184359/0/en/Workhorse-Group-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2020-Results.html). The majority of this large increase was actually due to an investment workhorse made in $RIDE. The only quarters that will generate a profit is those that WKHS made a good investment or sold vehicles, they have no recurring or stable revenue source.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# The MOASS (MAJOR PRO)\n\nThis stock has a huge potential for the Mother of All Short Squeezes. From [marketbeat.com](https://marketbeat.com) they claim 38.5% of workhorses shares are shorted. This is massive, and literally we just caught the shorts with their [pants down](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ns4bqz/amc_ceo_shows_us_he_isnt_wearing_pants/).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# So why the fuck did you buy it then?\n\nI bought it for the squeeze. WKHS Can gain a lot of potential with a larger capital if a squeeze were to occur.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Overall TL;DR:\n\nWorkhorse is a shit company in the long term and will never be able to scale appropriately given their current capital, but the short-term short squeeze could provide capital to allow for workhorse to build their own maintenance shops, charging stations, and dealerships around the US which will provide a stable revenue source. Currently they don't stand a chance against Amazon.\n\n**TL;DR OF THE TL;DR:**\n\nCompany shit, short squeeze good.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**DISCLAIMER**\n\nDon't sue me because of your own personal decisions on the free-market this isn't financial advice, and **I don't guarantee anything in the post to be true or accurate.** I don't intend to influence any decision, this is simply information I collected to share with my fellow apes.", "id": "nt6478", "created_utc": 1622929147.0, "score": 201, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "num_comments": 75, "comments": [{"body": "I\u2019m just in for the squeeze potential \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffb", "score": 45, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.09799432754516602}, {"body": "So the company is garbage but the squeeze is possible.
