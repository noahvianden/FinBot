We're talking about a whole different animal here; a business with mega earnings beats and real sales. Academy is located mainly in the Southern United States and operates 250+ stores. In the year 2000 (ancient history for some of you autistic fucks) they had 35 stores. They're growing like that weird thing on your aunts face that you're \"not supposed to talk about.\"\n\nASO went public via IPO in October of 2020 at a price of $12 or some shit. Let's take a look at what it's done since then, starting with the first 6 months of it's life:\n\n**^(WARNING: This next section contains some really retarded Travelcenters of America type of shit. Look at these extremely simplified charts may cause wrinkles, but is more likely to further smooth your brain; you're welcome.)**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hvjy089dbj571.png?width=1945&format=png&auto=webp&s=482cedd1b2b8b0aa64899b0b9f5af7f212eebe8b\n\nAs you can see (or maybe you can't because it's so fucking small) ASO doubled \ud83d\ude80 in its first 6 months on the market. For you really smooth brains, that's about $12 or 100% of upward movement. Now let's take a look at the 2 months or so since then...\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/484xbzuhbj571.png?width=1470&format=png&auto=webp&s=c793e2a46d80c974b306b889ed410cbf94fcc995\n\nThe earnings call in late March/early April was the kick in the ASO this thing needed. People started to realize this thing was undervalued and making fuck tons of money.\n\n**Just for reference - they absolutely murdered their most recent earnings too (last week):**\n\n* Adjusted income of $182.5 million vs Q1 2020 $400,000 income **(profitability)**\n* EPS of $1.89 (estimate was $0.90, 100%+ beat) vs Q1 2020 $0.01 **(shareholder value)**\n* Revenues up 40% year over year to $1.6 billion vs already optimistic estimate of $1.5 billion **(sales)**\n* Upped their 2021 guidance to $4.50 EPS (I think it was $3.90 or $4 or something who cares)\n\n**ASO is currently trading at a P/E ratio of about 7. The US industry average for specialty retail is about 15, representing a 100% upside based on P/E alone** and not considering the fact that it's banging harder than a group of soccer moms out late after a PTO meeting.\n\n# \"I see the lines and all the dildos, but what do I do?\" A fair question, fellow retard. I have no fucking clue...\n\nI'm not so great at drawing with crayons, just eating them. If you draw that blue line that touches the bottom of the low candles and insert a moving average (hey how are ya babe) - the moving average is as close to that line today as it's been in months. These red days thanks to inflation fears and the fed have opened the door for more retards to climb on board to tendyville. I believe this to be a great entry point. I like saying entry point.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**One last little nugget for you....** There's a bunch of words that auto mod picks up and deletes posts for, so I'm not going to say them, but take a look at this setup for ASO. *Appears to be some sort of primitive lift off ramp......*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rzmswu9vdj571.png?width=909&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d72ff918fe1c6a812f0d00f4ce3d629d6d1760b\n\nSee you on the moon.\n\nCheers", "id": "o0udtf", "created_utc": 1623809714.0, "score": 175, "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "num_comments": 68, "comments": [{"body": "500 shares, 70x 6/18 $35C, 20x 7/16 $35C\n\nbasically all-in.
