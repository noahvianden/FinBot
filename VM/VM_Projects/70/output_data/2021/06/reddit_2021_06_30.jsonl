Inflation eats up those 100% paper gains, and the government will be collecting tax on those gains even though you are no better off.\n\nIn addition hyperinflation is damaging to companies. Uncertainty, difficulty financing, needs for greater working capital, among other things does real economic damage to companies so not only are you paying taxes on a 100% gain that isn\u2019t really a gain at all, the companies you own are also worth less.\n\nIt\u2019s just an ugly situation nobody wants.

This much production goes here that much production goes there. The countries in USSR ( Soviet Union or how ever u call it) is like a brick wall. And in one moment u start taking out bricks from that wall and in one moment the system collapse. I ain\u2019t a pro Soviet Union. Don\u2019t get me wrong. My parrents were ok. They were the ppl who got green cards straight after the collapse of the Soviet Union so we were kinda ok. But all the rest were boom nothing. Imagine a factory that produces tomatoes. This factory sells to 5 countries tomatoes. The factory has 1000 employees. There is no private sector. Everything is government sector. In one moment a union collapse and every country is for itself. You can\u2019t find investors. You can\u2019t pay salaries because u don\u2019t sell the products because no one works for free. The country starts printing more and more money and etc. And from there u get the inflation. After that is hyperinflation. Then there is bankruptcy. I remember just gonna give u the example of bulgarian currency fliped in us dollars. Today the bread costs $0.45 tomorrow becomes $1 after 5 days $10 after thar they change the banknotes from 1 5 10 20 50 100 to 1000 5000 100000 20000 100 k. And one bread becomes 1000. Prices continue growing( now its private sector) money continue getting zeros on the back in one moment. The country decides to take a huge loan for 30 yrs. sell all government properties ( factories) to private foreign investors who actually bankrupts them for loans. From there you get the unemployment cause there is no where to work and then the loan which the country took makes to cover the major sectors. At this time 1 years passed. The government already agrees on deals to open borders with other countries. Usa comes gives a shit plan which will not work but same time gives green cards like french fries and gets the ppl they need for projects they didn\u2019t knew ( don\u2019t get me wrong things which the west didn\u2019t knew the east knew and the opposite). Ppl start going abroad sending money to their parrents. Usa Canada and etc were in the fastest economical growth( 90s). Salaries were huge for those ppl. $1 was equal to 5 bglev. ( now $1 is equal to 1.50 bglev) u get the country joining EU. nato. U don\u2019t need to feed 180 k army of ppl cause u are in NATO and EU so u reduce it to i think 10 k now. Most of barracks are shut. No government production. Everything is privatised. So businesses starts moving. That\u2019s the experience of hyperinflation. In American way is never gonna happen. Similiar like ours was the british economy crash i think in the 70s when two ppl split a job per week or something. My history memories about their crash is blurry. I studied but wasn\u2019t the same. U see u have one thing called federal bank. Guys your currency is leading currency ( at least another 20-30 yrs). U say ( your government\u2019s ) say INFLATION HYPERINFLATION... and in the end they print more money stability for5-10 yrs and yet another crash and another debt and another printing... etc etc. Usa had hyperinflation but non of us were born. The population was way smaller. Organise crime was bigger.. so listen when USA says hyperinflation i just smile \ud83d\ude00 and say... yeah... 4% hyperinflation. Google hyperinflation eastern europe and u will understand. Also forgot to mention PRIVATE BANKS was the buggest issue because the central bank of Bulgaria guarantee those loans from the private banks that took the money from european banks and world bank and they just withdrew the banks and bankrupted... i remember the number till today first 500 and later 2000 PERCENT\nNow we are still the poorest EU member ( if North Macedonia joins EU they will be the poorest \ud83d\ude00) but we are one of the biggest outsourcing countries in IT and Finances after Check Republic for Europe.
