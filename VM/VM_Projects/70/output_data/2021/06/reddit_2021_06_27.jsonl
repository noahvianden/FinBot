SPY, QQQ, Meme Stocks, Earnings", "selftext": "### The Broader Markets\n\n**Last Week \u2013** **SPY** finished the week well beyond its expected move, up 3% vs the 1.6% move options were pricing and making new all time highs. The VIX was lower as stocks moved higher, closing below 16 after beginning the week above 20.\n\n**This Week \u2013 SPY** options are pricing about a **1%** move (in either direction) for the upcoming week. That corresponds to about **$423** as a *bearish consensus* and **$430** as a *bullish consensus*.\n\n**Expected Moves for This Week** via Options AI:\n\n* SPY **0.8%** (0.6% less than last week)\n* QQQ **1.3%** (0.5% less than last week)\n* IWM **1.2%** (1.3% less than last week)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n### In the News\n\nAs markets made new highs meme stocks were once again some of the most actively traded names.

The decrease in commodity prices seems to support the fact that purchasers are canceling raw material orders which would mean the next few periods of inflation will be much lower and support the transitory theory. Of course time will tell but the commodity prices don\u2019t lie and they seem to be saying exactly what the Fed has this entire time. I didn\u2019t formulate these opinions by myself, I obviously watched a bunch of smart people talk about their predictions of the near future and these are the ones that I happen to agree with.\n\nThere is no doubt going to be a large shock when the Fed announces it is not buying bonds at its current rate anymore, but the sector rotation last week back into tech shows that most smart money is seeing the same.\n\nIn any case, there are a lot of other variables out there that I think are a bigger concern over margin debt. Specifically the amount of bonds being purchased by the Fed every month\u2026 And purchasers and commodities coming to some sort of equilibrium so we can get a true idea of what the actual supply chain restrictions are after a fully opened economy worldwide.\n\nMargin debt being high before a crash and lower afterwards I really do not think is an indicator.

If that\u2019s the case the affect on inflation would not be as big. \n\nTake stimulus for example, you give $1 in stimulus, The person you give it to saves a portion and spends the rest let\u2019s say they spend $.80. Whoever they spend that $.80 with saves a portion and spends the rest let\u2019s say they sped $.60 this repeats down the line until one dollar stimulus has basically a two or three dollar affect on the overall economy. This is the basis for new monetary theory with stimulus.\n\nNow take purchasers for a business. Everyone sold out of inventory they could not get their stock or supply or whatever it was to do business. Demand went through the roof. Purchasers make purchases plus a certain amount in anticipation of meeting future demand extrapolating future demand based on current demand\u2026 Which was unnaturally high. This happens the same way as a stimulus dollar, the store orders more from supplier, the supplier orders more plus future anticipated increase from their supplier, on down the line until the demand is multiplied the same.\n\nSo now you have all this demand for raw materials, price goes up, inflation. The feds theory (and also some fund people like Cathy wood) is this demand is not real. Once consumer spending goes back into services/experiences this material demand will fall off and normalize. So will prices. And thus the transitory inflation.

If you would have caught the bottom in Mid-may, you'd be up over 58%.\n\nHere's the same DD, with updated information.\n\nThink you missed it? No. I think this stock has room to run further. Here's why:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNano Dimension $NNDM\n\nCompany Description (From their website)\n\nNano Dimension Ltd. engages in the provision of intelligent machines for the fabrication of additively manufactured electronics. Its products and services include DragonFly Pro System, conductive and insulating inks for printed electronics, and optimized multi-material design of complex electronics.\n\n**Where They Can Sell**\n\nIn several investor phone calls the past few months by CEO Yoav Stern, he has stated SEVERAL times that the companies deals with companies in the Defense sector. What they produce with these machines (3d printed ELECTRONIC devices) can be used in many various sectors, like defense, medical, aerospace, etc. \n\nIn March, a RF circuit board printed by them was sent to the International Space Station. \n\nIn May, the company sold one of their machines to the University of Quebec.\n\n**Customers**\n\nNano Dimension recently posted their June 2021 Investors Presentation.\n\nLink: [https://www.nano-di.com/hubfs/2021-06-09-NNDM%20Corporate%20Presentation-final.pdf](https://www.nano-di.com/hubfs/2021-06-09-NNDM%20Corporate%20Presentation-final.pdf)\n\nSamsung, Nvidia, Elon Musk's Neuralink to name a few of their customers.\n\n[Nano Dimension $NNDM Customers](https://preview.redd.it/0l93gi20ov771.png?width=2822&format=png&auto=webp&s=f10c9f024fcad7cfd643e197c628d045899bb317)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Cathie Wood**\n\nShe is obsessed with Nano Dimension. Nano Dimension is in FOUR Ark ETFS. (\\* as of 6/27/21) Over 16 million shares she owns.\n\nARKQ (7,644,621 Shares)\n\nARKW (7,630,616 Shares)\n\nIZRL (733,585 Shares)\n\nPRNT (198,291 Shares)\n\n**Revenue**\n\nIt's a speculative stock as of now, so the numbers are not very pleasing.\n\nIn 2020, their total revenue was just $3.4 million, with $48.49 million in losses.\n\nIn pre-covid times, 2019, their revenue was $7 million. Flash forward two years, with a bunch of cash on hand (explained below) and hopefully as COVID subsides, I'm expecting to see higher revenues and hopefully in a few years positive earnings.\n\nMost recently, they released Q1 2021 Earnings. They reported revenue of $811,000 in the first quarter and a net loss of $9,314,000. \n\n*\"Wow they are losing a lot of money!\"*\n\n***-->  The Company ended the quarter with a cash and deposits balance of $1,471,014,000 (including short and long-term unrestricted bank deposits) <--***\n\n\\*As stated on their most recent earnings call, no guidance was given\\*\n\n**Cash on hand**\n\nEvery time the stock spiked, they did an offering. Their most recent offering, on February 16th was for $12.80. And it raised $500 MILLION. As of two weeks ago, they had just about $1.5 BILLION cash on hand. After two acquisitions already (explained below), they have just under $1.4 BILLION\n\n(Yes, that means a bunch of people bought shares at high prices and you can buy it now cheaper then they did)\n\nYes, stock offerings are not good but Yoav Stern (CEO) made it very clear on the investors phone call they hosted last week that they have enough cash on hand to do what they envision, and no more share offerings will happen.\n\nTo put this into perspective, they have $1.4 billion in cash. their market cap as of today is just under 2 billion. Roughly, their current cash values them alone at around $6 a share. This doesn't include patents they own, the newly acquired companies, their technology, and just the valuation itself.\n\n**Acquisitions**\n\nThe company plans to use its money on acquiring companies (No, $NNDM is NOT a SPAC)\n\nSo far, they've acquired two companies this year (and these are very tiny acquisitions, bigger ones are expected)\n\nDeepCube (AI Company - their technology will be used in the currently DragonFly Machine) ($70 Million TOTAL - 40 Million Cash / 30 Million Shares)\n\nNanoFabrica (3D Printing - \\*the company had a investment lead by Microsoft) (\\~$59 Million TOTAL - \\~$27 Million Cash / 32 Million Shares) \\*The final numbers are not confirmed\\*\n\nSo they've only burned through roughly $70 million. They still have around $1.4 Billion.\n\nTheir plan is to acquire companies listed as Type A, Type B, and Type C.\n\nType A - Existing companies in PCB business. Companies with revenue between 40-150 million!\n\nType B - Technologies they think their machines need\n\nType C - Companies that have machines that cater to the same customers that Nano Dimension does. Literally buying their competition and expanding their customer base.\n\n**Unusual Option Activity**\n\nSpecifically, for short term options, there is high open interest on 3 strike call prices.\n\nJuly 16th Options (\\*As of 6/27/21) \\*This stock has had HEAVY volume on $10 July 16th calls almost the entire week of June 21st-25th trading week.\n\n$7.50 - 11,820 Open Interest\n\n$10.00 - 39,978 Open Interest\n\n$12.50 - 18,114 Open Interest\n\nShould also be mentioned the activity on the Puts.\n\n$7.50 PUT - 6,732 Open Interest\n\n**Stock Activity**\n\nThis stock, as well as other growth stocks, seem to be gaining steam again, and momentum looks to be back. Do with that as you please.\n\n**Upcoming Catalysts**\n\n* News related to new customers/partnerships/sales, including with their 2 new recently acquired companies, NanoFabrica & DeepCube\n* According to the CEO, they have a NEW DragonFly they are expecting to release in the near-future\n* Any further acquisitions (Already had 2 this year - The CEO on their May earnings call said starting in June they can tour facilities - they couldn't before because of COVID)\n\n**Video With More Information**\n\nQuick 15 minute video with the CEO, Yoav Stern.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdE6DoqmeqY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdE6DoqmeqY)\n\n**The Negatives**\n\n* The company has a rather high short interest (many websites are giving different numbers, but according to FinViz it is around 38%)\n* The company isn't producing high revenues, and its burning cash\n\nTL;DR - This company has a bunch of cash (1.4 billion), has some futuristic technology, and can literally buy out their competition or buy companies that'll help them (which they are doing)\n\nPosition:\n\n820 Shares\n\n*Not a financial advisor*", "id": "o96e9n", "created_utc": 1624830396.0, "score": 254, "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "num_comments": 77, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|2|**First Seen In WSB**|1 month ago\n**Total Comments**|22|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n2ip93/nndm_may_literally_3d_print_solid_returns/) \n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3420594334602356}, {"body": "You had me at Cathie Wood.
