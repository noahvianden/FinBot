{"title": "Amazon details new warehouse robots, \u2018Ernie\u2019 and \u2018Bert\u2019.", "selftext": "Amazon warehouse workers could soon be joined by a couple new co-workers: Ernie and Bert.\n\nThose are the names of the new robots Amazon is testing with the goal of reducing strenuous movements for workers.\n\nWhile the introduction of robots to the workplace often raises questions about whether human jobs will be replaced, Amazon argues they simply allow workers to focus on tasks that most need their attention while minimizing their potential for injury. Amazon said it\u2019s added over a million jobs around the world since it began using robotics in its facilities in 2012.\n\nIn May, Amazon announced a goal of reducing recordable incident rates by 50% by 2025. It plans to invest over $300 million into safety projects this year.\n\nAmazon described in a blog post Sunday four robots it\u2019s testing to move items across its fulfillment centers and closer to workers.\n\nErnie helps remove items from a robotic shelf so employees don\u2019t have to. The process doesn\u2019t save time, Amazon said in the post, but testing has so far indicated it could make work safer for employees.\n\nBert is one of Amazon\u2019s first Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs), made to navigate facilities independently, even while workers are moving around. Unlike other robots, Bert would not need to remain in a restricted space, meaning workers could ask it to take items across a facility. Amazon said Bert could eventually move heavier items.\n\nSource article with videos of the robots:  https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/13/amazon-details-new-warehouse-robots-ernie-and-bert.html", "id": "nzcoln", "created_utc": 1623638568.0, "score": 87, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 69, "comments": [{"body": "South Park was right", "score": 43, "replies": [{"body": "We will all become bio Alexas for the wealthy?", "score": 5, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.09420283138751984}, {"body": "They took our jobs!!!", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "Dey took err juuub!", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "TURK A DURRR", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "DE DURK A JEEEEERRB!!!!", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": ["de"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.37406352162361145}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3121682405471802}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.08908699452877045}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.10160144418478012}, {"body": "There can't be any employee safety issues if there aren't any humans working in the warehouse.", "score": 44, "replies": [{"body": "I mean, this is a good thing though.
