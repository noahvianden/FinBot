Reddit was not the reason I was watching.\n\nReasons:\n\nThere was no Corsair specific news yesterday, but E3 was going on that same weekend. I expected Microsoft to have an amazing show, after buying several of my all time favorite mid-budget independent game developers a few years ago with no new game announcements from them yet. \n\nI also knew that Sony, their main competitor for AAA game presentations at E3, was not showing at E3. Microsoft would win the show by default, and almost all of their \"exclusives\" are also on PC at launch, and available through Game Pass.\n\nPeople are still sitting on 970 and 1080 cards after many many years, wanting to upgrade but never feeling like it's the right time. The 970 and 1080 cards were extremely popular, but the next generation was a minimal upgrade, and the next after that was way overpriced. People have just been waiting way too damn long to build a PC until prices fall. A major reason they haven't is crypto mining. Crypto hype seems to have peaked a month ago, and now there's major pullback. Not something I pay much attention to, but if the bubble can burst, video card sales will be driven by games again, and that means Corsair cooling options will be desirable for new gaming rigs, as well as Corsair RAM and Corsair Cherry Red mechanical keyboards.\n\nAs for stocks that play into that prediction, NVDA and MSFT prices move on matters way bigger than gaming, matters I know nothing about, and LOGI seems to be a company aiming higher than my interest as well, but I avoid that simply due to 3 gaming mice breaking on me in 6 years. They're all pretty expensive. As for the non-MSFT games I'm excited about, those companies aren't publicly traded.\n\nJust in general, I see the games market moving away from consoles and towards PCs. Many disagree with me on that, but I've been saying that since PS4, and PS5 has been extremely hard to get. I think people are losing patience on getting a PS5 and looking instead to XBox Game Pass, which supports not just XBox, but also PC. \n\nWith the economy re-opening, those who returned to work have buying power on Amazon Prime Day, in one week, to buy PC parts. Those who are bearish on Corsair like to point to Logitech as the better company, which may be true, but to me it feels like they're doing different things. \n\nAs for yesterday? \n\nI was warned pre-market that there were a ton of Corsair bagholders out there who spent the last few months watching it fall from mid-40s to mid-30s. The pre-market surge would result in a massive amount of people waking up that morning and seeing a good opportunity to finally get out of the stock they've been holding since February. They did. The stock dropped hard. The people who planned to buy it that day, either because of Reddit or because of E3, saw an opportunity to ride the dip back up again, and it simply did not stagger significantly at any point on the way up. The stock was almost to the same level it had been pre-market with just an hour to go on the day, so when it failed to go any higher, bagholders who missed that morning opportunity to bail out and day traders riding the charts dropped it at the same time, causing a plunge so fast and hard it was felt in the following trading day.\n\nMost people trade stocks based on numbers and charts. I just go by how the wind feels. I see Corsair sailing on it, not as a WSB stock, because I think that moment has passed, but as a stock that should be able to rise on its own merits.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["msft", "msft", "bubble", "amzn", "nvda"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["pm"]}
