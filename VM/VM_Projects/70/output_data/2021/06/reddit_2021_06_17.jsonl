{"title": "Tencent Deep Dive Analysis - Amazing Company to Keep an Eye On", "selftext": "Hey all, please see below my deep dive analysis on Tencent ($TCEHY). I know Chinese stocks are highly controversial, so it\u2019d be great to hear opinions from both sides.\n\n**What Does Tencent Do?**\n\n* Tencent is the largest company in China and has just way too many businesses and so in this section, I will be focusing on the three you need to know as an investor, which include QQ and WeChat, gaming, and Tencent\u2019s investment portfolio\n* **QQ and WeChat**\n   * Just as a bit of history, Tencent was founded in 1998 by current CEO Pony Ma and 4 other founders who were college friends\n   * Their first product was OICQ which was later renamed to **QQ** and was a messaging application that still exists today and boasts [**more than 606 million monthly active users**](https://www.tencent.com/attachments/1Q21ProductListofTencent.pdf)\n   * But the jewel in the crown is **WeChat** which is known as Weixin in China which was launched in 2011 and now serves over [**1.2 billion users**](https://www.tencent.com/attachments/1Q21ProductListofTencent.pdf)\n   * These two applications are at the core of Tencent\u2019s business model and drive the entire ecosystem by enabling Tencent to launch a suite of other products like such as games, music, payment transactions, and more. Basically, you can think of WeChat as a\u00a0super app that combines Facebook, Shopify, Uber, GoogleMaps,\u00a0WhatsApp, TikTok and a whole lot more.\n   * **It\u2019s really hard to overstate the power of WeChat.** I\u2019ve read in my research that even homeless people in China use WeChat to receive money and when I was doing business with suppliers in China for my old business, I only used WeChat to communicate\n   * Because of this, **there are just an endless number of ways for Tencent to continue building out its ecosystem** because they can always add new functionalities to WeChat like the TikTok feature they added when they saw TikTok dominating or TenPay to take on Alipay\n* **Gaming**\n   * Though WeChat is the engine that drives Tencent\u2019s business, **gaming is actually the** [**real money maker and profit driver**](https://www.tencent.com/attachments/1Q21ResultsPresentation.pdf) **for the company**\n   * Tencent has been involved in the gaming industry since 2004 and since then has become the **second largest player** **in the world** after Sony with $13.9 billion in revenue\n      * The company holds a dominant **43% market share in China** and owns the **top 3 PC games and top 2 mobile games published in 2020**\n      * Another important thing to note is\u00a0that given the PC and console markets have been stalling, **Tencent has been focusing a lot of its attention to mobile gaming,** which now owns\u00a0roughly **70% market share**\u00a0of the gaming market\n   * **Tencent obviously has a natural advantage with WeChat** given\u00a0that it\u2019s a mobile app that can be used to market to 1.2 billion users, but another one of Tencent's advantages is **Yingyong Bao** which is also known as Tencent My App and is China\u2019s leading Android app store with [**26% market share**](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1058612/china-android-app-store-market-share/)\n      * So basically, if you\u2019re a game creator, not only do you have to create a game that competes against the resources and teams Tencent has, but whenever Tencent releases a game, it can automatically market it through WeChat users and feature the app on Tencent My App\n      * All of this would result in the game being downloaded more and becoming the number one most downloaded gaming app even though it may not standalone be the best game\n   * As a result, it may come as no surprise that Tencent owns a dominant [**52% of China\u2019s mobile gaming market**](https://console.kr-asia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/mobile-games2-1.jpg)\n   * **Believe it or not, this is not where the dominance ends.** Just take a look at all the [**investments**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tencent) Tencent has made in some of the world\u2019s top gaming companies including Riot Games, Supercell, Epic Games, and Activision Blizzard\n* **Tencent\u2019s investment portfolio**\n   * First of all, it\u2019s important to note that while Tencent does own a majority stake in many businesses, **the company\u2019s investment philosophy is well known to be hands-off** meaning that after they invest, they just let the company do its thing\n   * Tencent owns a very impressive portfolio of 800+ companies including 20% of Meituan, 100% of Riot Games, 25.6% of Sea, and even 5% of Tesla\n      * Based on the last calculated market value of these companies, Tencent\u2019s ownership from its portfolio is estimated **$331 billion (couldn't provide source link due to subreddit rules)**\n      * A large part of Tencent\u2019s growth strategy is inorganic and the company has shown no signs of slowing down\n\n**The Bull Case**\n\n* **Reason #1 - WeChat which is a nearly impenetrable moat that Tencent will enjoy for at least another decade or two**\n   * WeChat users spent **$115 billion** **through mini programs in 2019** and exact figures weren\u2019t disclosed in Tencent\u2019s 2020 annual report but I did find that in their report that annual transaction volume from Mini programs doubled in 2020\n   * All of this is important because while WeChat is a dominant force, user growth has been slowing given that it already penetrates nearly all of China and so it\u2019ll be important for Tencent to continue monetizing on its users to propel further growth\n* In order to not be too repetitive, I won\u2019t touch upon gaming and Tencent\u2019s investment portfolio\n* **Reason #2 - Livestreaming**\n   * Tencent owns a dominant **37% and 38% stake in China\u2019s largest gaming streaming sites named Huya and Douyu** and has been pushing for the two companies to merge\n   * This would remove a lot of the competition between the two platforms which control **90% of the streaming market** but the deal is uncertain to pass due to the heightened antitrust environment\n   * But either way, Tencent still owns a commanding share of the two companies and live streaming is a fast growing industry that serves as a **great complement to Tencent\u2019s gaming business**\n* **Reason #3 - Tencent's fintech and business services**\n   * This is the **fastest growing segment of Tencent\u2019s business** and it grew by 47% year over year in the first quarter of 2021\n   * Regarding fintech, Tencent has been able to take considerable share away from Alipay through Tenpay which currently accounts for about **39% of transactions,** which is up from about 10% in 2014\n      * **Tenpay is basically like Venmo or Paypal on steroids** and it allows for cashless transactions amongst peers and merchants, while also providing services like loans that are approved within 3 minutes and a whole lot more\n      * **Regarding the cloud, Tencent holds the 3rd place spot** in terms of market share and given that the overall industry grew by 62% in Q4 2020, I\u2019m sure Tencent will be putting a lot of efforts into this business segment\n\n**The Bear Case**\n\n* **Reason #1 - Regulatory risk by the Chinese Communist Party or CCP**\n   * Unlike Jack Ma who notoriously spoke out against the party and caused many issues for Alibaba, **Tencent is known to have a very strong relationship with the government**\n   * Even still, the CCP can at any time change its policies that can hurt Tencent\u2019s business with one such example being in **2018 when the CCP stopped approving gaming licenses for 9 months**\n   * There have also been a lot of **antitrust news** and Tencent is expected to pay a fine of around **$1.5 billion for anticompetitive practices** and the CCP can do things like this out of thin air\n* **Reason #2 - Political unrest between China and the rest of the world**\n   * While President, Trump issued an order to ban WeChat transactions which never actually took effect and was recently **revoked by the Biden administration**\n   * Still, the risk remains especially in the case that China grows way too powerful that **countries will work to limit its power,** such as making Tencent sell off its US holdings if an anti-China US president came to power\n   * What should be noted though is that **Tencent\u2019s business mostly resides in China (97%),** so there would be notable but minimal impact\n* **Reason #3 - WeChat is dominant but slowing in growth**\n   * One of the newest and fiercest competitors is **ByteDance** which is the company behind Douyin / Tiktok\n   * [**TikTok has over 689 million monthly active users while Douyin has over 600 million,**](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/tik-tok-statistics/) and as we\u2019ve seen with WeChat, once you have the users, your opportunities to create additional businesses are endless\n   * In a sign of what may be to come, **ByteDance created a hit game** and may be starting to encroach upon Tencent\u2019s gaming dominance\n   * That said, Bytedance has a long way to go, having earned just $42 million with its top game vs. hundreds of millions for Tencent and **previous game launches have been unsuccessful**\n* **Reason #4 - Tencent trades in the US as a Level 1 ADR**\n   * [**Level 1 ADRs trade on OTC markets**](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/041015/what-are-differences-between-levels-i-ii-and-iii-american-depository-receipts-adrs.asp) and don\u2019t need to abide by GAAP accounting which result in less reliability and transparency\n   * I don\u2019t think that Tencent would commit accounting fraud given that the company is so large now but they are operating with some looser standards and this is something to keep in mind\n   * There was also some talk about the US delisting Chinese ADRs so again, this is another risk\n\n**Financials & Valuation**\n\n* Starting off with the [financials](https://www.tencent.com/attachments/1Q21CorporateOverview.pdf)\u00a0(refer to this link for the datapoints I reference below), Tencent is a highly profitable business with an adjusted EBITDA margin that has hovered around 40% for the past few years which is extremely solid\n   * The company has just about as much cash as debt and normally you might want to see a larger cash position, but Tencent is generating so much in free cash flow that it really doesn\u2019t matter\n   * For instance, the company\u2019s debt to adjusted EBITDA is around 1.3x and for this ratio, about 6.0x is where you would get really worried about being\u00a0over leveraged and so Tencent is way below that\n* Regarding valuation, I\u2019ll be referring to this [table](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E4FkTDhVoAAluTO?format=jpg&name=large)\u00a0and comparing Tencent to its peers (trading comps)\n   * Amongst the\u00a0Chinese peers, we can see that **Tencent\u2019s revenue growth is in the\u00a0middle of the pack** but its **profitability numbers** aka its EBITDA margin, profit margin, and free cash flow yield **lead the pack**\n   * This along with Tencent\u2019s competitive moat and impressive investment portfolio is probably why **Tencent is trading at a premium versus its Chinese peers**\n   * **Amongst the U.S. peers,** we see that **Tencent is growing the fastest in revenue while is more in the middle of the pack for profitability**\n   * You can also see that Tencent is in the middle of the pack when it comes to multiples vs. its U.S. peers meaning that **Tencent is not cheap vs. its U.S. peers either**\n* Based on all this I think Tencent is an amazing business with a nearly impenetrable moat in various industries, but there are a lot of risks investing in Chinese companies, so I\u2019d want to invest in companies that are a bit more discounted so I can have a higher margin of safety\n* **Tencent is not the cheapest company vs. its Chinese peers nor its U.S. peers** and so for me, I would want to see Tencent trading at much lower multiples before I invest, probably somewhere around 15x 2022 EBITDA (loosely speaking)\n   * This is because I could simply invest in U.S. companies at a better valuation while not taking on the risks that come with investing in Chinese companies\n   * That said, if you believe that China will vastly outgrow U.S. companies and are not as sensitive to the risks with Chinese stocks, Tencent\u2019s moat may be enough to warrant an investment with a long-term time horizon\n\n**TLDR:** Tencent with WeChat, its gaming business, and investment portfolio has an incredible moat. That said, the company is not trading cheaply and so personally I would wait for the price to come down a bit before investing. That said, I welcome all counter points and it\u2019d be great to hear your thoughts.", "id": "o1y13c", "created_utc": 1623938654.0, "score": 17, "upvote_ratio": 0.64, "num_comments": 70, "comments": [{"body": "You get the same kneejerk comments on every DD of Chinese stocks, so IDK why people bother writing them anymore.

Dividend growth has been extremely sluggish for more than 5 years, rising only about 17.5% in that time frame. Share price has also barely moved $4 up in 5 years for a flaccid 1% gain per year.

Do not make the mistake of thinking that rising property prices help REITs however. Thats a mistake. Though equity gains are always good for many reasons such as allowing said REIT to leverage more, you cant just sell their properties to realize a gain. In general, REITs are valued based on operating sector and cap rates. So what you want is rents to go up. \n\nThough it might make sense for rent to go up when property value goes up, this isnt always the case. Rent is actually tied to household income growth for residential and business growth for everything else. If you go to other countries, for example, where land is scarcer but incomes are lower, you will find property values are sky high but cap rates are super low and thats just normal in most of the world.\n\nNot advising to buy or sell.

This is fine if you are a retiree since your intent is to spend the money, not build wealth. \n\nBut if you are talking investment inflation then the answer is no. Investment indices have far outperformed 4% thus you are actually losing buying power over time if your intent is to dump the money into investments.

{"title": "Lion Electric (LEV) deal with Amazon and why it's the biggest sleeper EV stock out there", "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\n[Lion Electric Amazon truck](https://preview.redd.it/qcaahv97bu571.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0d0414275d3e823b158ba4351de7d5c70395d05c)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI try not to fall in love with a stock but Lion Electric (LEV) is one that I think is such a solid stock right now, especially at this price. I post pretty regularly in the daily about it but usually get shot down instantly as a bot or spammer which I think is really weird. I just think it\u2019s a great play and has no many catalysts and upside for both long hold and options. I\u2019m not going to pump and dump, I\u2019m in it for the long haul but will play some call options along the way. I currently have 1050 shares which include regular shares and warrants. The warrants can be converted one to one for shares by 2026 at a set price of $11.50. I also have Oct. calls at $30, and will be adding more shares and options on dips. Here is my Schwab account but I also have a TD Ameritrade account with 250 shares and the Oct options.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Part of my LEV position](https://preview.redd.it/xn55enbebu571.jpg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e8eef614d306afd591ca420b14661ba229437293)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe stock has been a sleeper here in WSB, guess it\u2019s not a short squeeze or high volatility but the upside is tremendous and opportunity to moon is high.  The 5 analysts offering 12-month price forecasts for Lion Electric Co have a median target of 22.00, with a high estimate of 26.00 and a low estimate of 20.00. The median estimate represents a +20.02% increase from the last price of 18.33.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey currently have manufacturing facilities in Montreal, Canada and Sacramento, California and building another major plant, biggest commercial EV plant in the U.S. in Joliet Illinois. Also just broke ground on a battery manufacturing facility also near Montreal. Both will be producing mid to late 2022. Below is their school bus and at the top of the post their Lion6 Amazon truck.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Lion Electric School Bus](https://preview.redd.it/ja068r6mbu571.png?width=794&format=png&auto=webp&s=06fcea81a85e37db48cb26dc2137f3d042725fff)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome highlights of the past few months.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Vehicle order book of      817 all-electric medium- and heavy-duty urban vehicles as of May 14th,      2021, consisting of 209 trucks and 608 buses, representing a combined      total order value of over $225 million.\n* Lion Energy order book of      76 charging stations as of May 14th, 2021, representing a combined total      order value of over $800,000.\n* Secured an order of 260      school buses from First Student, a leading school bus operator on May 14,      2021, with deliveries expected to take place from the second half of 2021      to the first half of 2023.\n* Obtained initial truck      orders from sizable fleet owners, such as Pride Group, Ikea's logistics      partners (Second Closet and Metro Supply Chain Group), Sobeys, ConEdison      and Heritage during and after the end of the quarter.\n* Delivery of the first 10      Lion6 trucks to Amazon completed shortly after the end of the quarter.\n* Significant progress in      recruitment, with total company headcount exceeding 650 employees as of      the date hereof, along with key strategic hires, as we look to accelerate      and support long-term growth.\n* Significant progress on      long-term strategy, including formal announcement of the site selection      for the U.S. manufacturing facility and launch of the battery plant and      innovation center construction, including C$100 million funding support      towards construction costs.\n* Successful debut as a      publicly-traded company on both the NYSE and the TSX, with net transaction      proceeds resulting from the related business combination transaction of      approximately $490 million.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Lion Electric Big Rig](https://preview.redd.it/1ebsvfarbu571.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=85a5cada40bceb50cc5fc6b69bd97ded32b0642d)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nParts from an article on the company from montrealintechnology\n\nLion Electric will produce a giant order for Amazon for up to 2,500 all-electric Lion 6 and Lion 8 trucks by 2025. Amazon has the option to purchase upwards of 19.98 percent of the company through shares and warrants, if they purchase $1.1 billion worth of products.\n\nLion Electric will also provide maintenance and training for Amazon.\n\nLion Electric is required to reserve a portion of its manufacturing capacity for up to 500 trucks per year from 2021 to 2025. The deal calls for Lion Electric to provide the greater of 500 trucks per year of 10 percent of manufacturing capacity from 2026 to 2030, notes [Yahoo! Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/northern-genesis-spac-rallies-lion-162015419.html).\n\nThe framework agreement with Amazon wrapped up in July 2020,  but was hidden in a long stock exchange notice. Amazon Logistics is listed as the specified customer in the SEC filing.\n\nIn the filing, the company revealed that it had 300 purchase orders for up to 6,000 vehicles at the time of its SPAC merger announcement. The company predicts 2021 revenue hitting $204 million from 650 units sold. **In 2023, revenue is expected to jump to $1.67 billion from 7,580 units sold.**\n\n**How did Lion Electric meet Amazon?**\n\nBedard, the company\u2019s CEO, was a guest speaker at an event in the trucking industry. There he met the folks at Amazon, which started a relationship that lead us to today. After the event, Bedard invited Amazon to come to Quebec to see Lion\u2019s trucks.\n\n\u201cThey tested and audited the truck, I imagine they liked it, they made a master agreement with us and we\u2019re all really excited about this.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m excited too, feels like a \u201ccan\u2019t go tits up\u201d kinda stock but do your own DD and come to your own conclusions. I plan to keep adding and feel pretty secure doing so. If it moons great, if it goes steadily up and doubles in price, that\u2019s cool, if Amazon goes all in and it frickin rockets out of the atmosphere\u2026then yeah, I will say I told ya so.\n\nWhat do you all think about LEV?
