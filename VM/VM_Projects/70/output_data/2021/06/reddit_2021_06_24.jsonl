In this case he bought 20 contracts which allows him to buy 20\\*100=2000 shares if he decides to exercise his contracts.\n\n7/16 exp = Date the contract will expire. In this case, 16th July.\n\n$80.60 = The money you receive per share if you were to sell the contract. So take this number, times the number of shares to get the amount of money he earns. In this case, 80.60\\*2000 = $161,200\n\nHe could also exercise his contract which means he can buy 2000 TSLA shares at $575 each. Since TSLA shares are $646.23 right now, he earns 2000(646.23-575) = $142,460.\n\nBut he will need about $1.15M capital in order to exercise his contracts and yet it will net him less gains as compared to selling the contracts itself.\n\nHope it helps!\n\nPs; thank you u/st1llet01 for explaining this to me 2 weeks ago.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Spread the love baby", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.006373804993927479}], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "https://www.ig.com/uk/options-trading/what-are-options-how-do-you-trade-them", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.10309341549873352}, {"body": "Bump", "score": 0, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.08460481464862823}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.027096005156636238}, {"body": "Debit spreads eh", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah went in at 605 then it keep dropping and I keep buying.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2927016615867615}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1925465613603592}, {"body": "Got out of my weekly 650c today for around 300% gains. \n\nTesla summer party is going to get started.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Sweet \ud83d\ude0e.
