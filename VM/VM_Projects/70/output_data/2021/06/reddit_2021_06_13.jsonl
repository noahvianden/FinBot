I\u2019ve not have great success with my car seeing the spot that I want to park in, I end up doing it manually (maybe I\u2019m doing something wrong?).\n- Summon feels like a party trick, it\u2019s too slow in my opinion right now, maybe that will get improved with v9.\n- FSD computer is.

The FSD computer only matters for cars sold pre-HW3.0 as all new cars are HW3.0. I'm really not sure how they will handle the computer upgrade thing as you won't be able to use v9 unless you have HW3.0. I think either they charge for a replacement, i.e. $1-2k, or allow people to sign a fixed-term contract, i.e. 3 years minimum, and they get the computer for free. The second option also means they lock in the price, which isn't what Tesla wants. I think the fixed upgrade charge makes more sense. \n\nThere is zero chance they price it at $50 per month. Tesla has said it will make more financial sense to buy it outright so that kind of places a floor on the price of FSD. At the current price of $10k, a subscription of $50 would be 200 months which is 16.7 years. This is longer than the useful life of the average vehicle. \n\n$200 per month is $6.67 per day. That isn't even unreasonable for a car with the current features if you drive a lot. Once V9 is out and the car can basically handle all the driving, but you still need to pay attention, that is a steal. Especially for commuters. \n\nOnce you can let the car drive without attention on a specific area, i.e. highway, the price should go up even further. If you are able to write emails/do research on the road it should be worth like $5-10 per hour. There is no competition for it and the incremental value the user gets is the value of their wage. Tesla taking 20-30% of that is reasonable. $10 per hour and assuming 1 hour per day of highway commute, is \\~$200 per month. Add to this the additional value to the user of all other driving, i.e. weekend/non-highway. and you can easily get to \\~$300 per user per month. \n\nThis also doesn't take into account high mileage users, some people drive 3-4 hours per day, and an FSD Tesla would be worth a lot to these people. Tesla might want to focus on capturing higher mileage customers at the beginning as they have larger value to be unlocked.

I have updated it with the current one. Nothing has changed. Only year 2024 is now projecting net profit instead of net loss.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*EDIT NOTE\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nHello everyone, it\u2019s me again, Ragnaros. My last DCF got a ton of feedback and I wanted to incorporate most of it in my next one. So here is my DCF 2.0, an improved version of my last DCF. Before I start posting my pictures of my DCF, I want to explain a few things.\n\nFirst of all, I want to clear out that with lack of financial data and given it\u2019s a growth company at its early stages, it was hard to do any kind of DCF; therefore, there were many educated and conservative assumptions made.\n\nThis time, I performed 3 different DCFs for three difference scenarios i.e., Bear, Base and Bull scenarios. For simplicity, the probability of each happening was assigned 25%/50%/25% respectively. Moreover, for each case above, I have also done a sensitivity analysis based of different weighted average cost of capital (WACC), terminal value and also expected future dilution of shares. More details on the sensitivities later.\n\n***Note:*** I feel like I\u2019ve been somewhat conservative with my assumptions compared to what another analysts/websites have been projecting for BNGO. Oh, and also, Nanonozzle revenue hasn\u2019t been projected in this DCF. Adding that would only affect the share price positively.\n\nSo here we go\u2026.\n\n***BASE:***\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/is69p6rmz4571.png?width=2814&format=png&auto=webp&s=e713fdcbe55f15eb64559513a23200ec235bf4ad\n\n***BULL:***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b54vrnl174571.png?width=2812&format=png&auto=webp&s=0743fc0c652afba4d3b678adb2e9481f07c7c73c\n\n***BEAR:***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r7g6rlc274571.png?width=2782&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0cd9c80cfdb20dba515a52345f6aac5b9ae5884\n\nI know I know. First thing everybody is gonna come and explode about the unachievable 65%-75% CAGR on \u201cSaphyrs Installed\u201d and \u201cGross Revenue.\u201d Hear me out! Its not just me, below are some analysts/websites who believe the same.\n\n***An analyst from Seeking Alpha:***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4d8yijy374571.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ecd8105a2c49a6c95950179356b19a6acdc7511\n\nLook at his \u201cUnits\u201d and \u201cTotal\u201d CAGR for the next 5 years. For me, I\u2019m projecting about 65%-75% for the next 10 years. Seems in line to him.\n\n***Next is this:***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/14p59sq474571.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=b97b1b8976d930b9eeceb0e41693fda505b56325\n\nAnother analyst, who projected for the next 8 years. His CAGR for \u201cGross Profit\u201d is ((586M/12M)\\^(1/7))-1 = 75%. This analyst is expecting about 500M in net profit by 2028. In my base case, I\u2019m expecting 300M net profit by 2028.\n\n***ChartMill*** website predicts revenue to grow at an exploding rate of 90% CAGR for the 5 years (isn\u2019t this insane?) and people were calling me crazy for 70% CAGR in my last DCF.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nrm17am574571.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=35d75ccdb37369fcb146db47972a1edfbb6ecbab\n\nAnd last piece to support my assumption is from ARK Invest\u2019s Big Ideas for 2021 presentation:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qurnlnc674571.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=27fd5c2ef83644849fa13a1a6098ef557f4acc87\n\nWell isn\u2019t ARK is \u201cto know all about genomics\u201d? Well they say this market is expected to grow 82% CAGR for the next 5 years.\n\nI hope these all pieces are enough to support my claim.\n\nNext up, how am I differentiating between Bear/Base/Bull scenarios. Well basically the differentiating factor in all cases is the re-occuring revenue. As per the CEO in Q4 2020 earnings transcript (picture below), he expects every Saphyr to produce 60K \u2013 150K every year. I also believe he is not including Saphyr 2.0 revenues in it. Well then it was easy for me to assign approx. 80K in Bear case, 110k to Base case and 140k to Bull case. Hence, my row in DCF called \u201cRe-Occuring Revenue per Saphyr.\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/79j1kxr774571.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=e93322e03fba92d74c25c9ee3df5a7bfbd8d656c\n\nIn my last DCF, I didn\u2019t do a great job in assuming expenses, so I tried to be more specific in this one. The Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) or the Gross Margin assumption is set to be more realistic. I have increased it about 2.5% CAGR. Only in Bull case, I think they would increase it by 3.5% CAGR. Operating expenses will be the biggest cost to Bionano for the next few years as they will be spending a lot for exponential growth. And also as per the CFO he said to expect about 20% - 40% OPEX for the next couple of years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iky1plc874571.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=b261e4fd64dba35078b8dc3945f5028b7739576b\n\nAnother thing I would like to bring your attention to is the market opportunity the CEO thinks when we sell/install 10k Saphyrs:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h3g4sq1974571.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=b30379f782ab2eea754ed1b9ed4cd302d8b3fffd\n\nWhen we hit the 10k Saphyrs \u201cinstalled\u201d, not \u201csold\u201d mark, you can see the Consumables Revenue is about 1.8B and total revenue collected from Saphyrs sold (2021 \u2013 2030) is about 1.2B. This all adds up to about 3B revenue which about right in between in what the CEO thinks; hence, my base case.\n\nIn my last DCF, I also didn\u2019t include taxes. Although taxes are 23% in the state of California, not every company pays that amount. They report expenses to get tax credits and as per my research, they pay around 16%-20% taxes. For my DCF, I have assumed 19% taxes in all scenarios. Another thing I want to point out is if you read the analysis of the analyst in the SeekingAlpha link above, he used a tax rate of 16%. Overall, taxes don\u2019t have a significant impact of DCF.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Now to the juicy part, the SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS:***\n\n***1)  WACC:***\n\nI chose WACC between 10% - 17% is to incorporate all cases that includes industry average, future inflation fears that is going on, Bionano\u2019s cost of equity or debt increases etc etc.\n\n***2)  Terminal Value:***\n\nWell, this one has a significant impact on BNGO\u2019s current price target because this assumption takes care of forever growth of BNGO. I do believe that even after 2030 the company will grow at a higher rate till 2050-2060. However, for this study, I chose 2%-4% because 2% is to keep up with average inflation rate and 4% is because average GDP growth rate is 3% - 4%. Therefore, it made sense to make a range out of it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m73asty974571.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa0ae925722265531ebf86c079adf28a8ba951f4\n\nI have done a sensitivity analysis for all dilution cases i.e.;\n\n***1)  No dilution:***\n\nThis means the company will not dilute its share for the next 10 years or even more than that. I think this case is highly likely because company has enough cash to last for the next several years. I know they have already opened a contract for more offerings up to 350M, but I don\u2019t think they will be doing it anytime soon. So I guess that will be done when price is 10+ or even 20+. As a result, about 17M \u2013 30M extra shares will be added to current outstanding, which will not have a significant impact in share price.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2dja53ya74571.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=11320269f0cc7581688806c993a09530b1bbf51b\n\n***2)  25% dilution:***\n\nThis means the in the next several years, company will dilute 25% of its current outstanding shares i.e., 279M\\*1.25 = 349M new outstanding shares. This means that about extra 80M shares will be added. This will equal to about 800M \u2013 1.5B (assuming offering at share price $10 - $20) worth of offering. I believe this is unlikely because Bionano will most likely be net profit positive by 2024 and will be self-sufficient. The only case why I think BNGO will do this kind of offering is to acquire some other small business for growth purposes. Other than that, I don\u2019t see them doing such a big offering.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qila36lb74571.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=d7c75fcc4f87f082d7ed7e2627d6c9ac44097336\n\n***3)  50% dilution:***\n\nSimilar to the point above, this would translate to an addition of about 130M shares which equals to about 1.3B \u2013 2B (assuming offering at share price $10 - $20) worth of offering. This scenario is very unlikely to happen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xbftkwec74571.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=dbcaf7cc470a8546c3b782f5c9e7fe0b5d3478c7\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/owhuyk9d74571.png?width=418&format=png&auto=webp&s=d8fef82b1e15c5172ccc58d161f61bdbcfc76f1a\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7lo9hdvd74571.png?width=324&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e619f5cbbdc6e73be96fd469ae662f467f68396\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWithout dilution, my average price comes to $17. With 25% dilution, my average price comes to $14. With 50% dilution, my average price comes to $12. This is all assuming that chances of all WACC and TV are equally likely to happen. With three different prices and assuming 40%/40%/20% for all dilution cases I finally come to a conclusion of a current price target of $15. Obviously, I\u2019m not saying price should be exactly $15, but somewhere in the ballpark. I would say anything below $10 is a steal and a \u201cbuy\u201d, and current price should be anywhere between $12 - $16. Furthermore, to support my price target, here are the analysts\u2019 ratings from tip ranks below. My price target is close to their 12 month\u2019s price target.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***I\u2019m no financial advisor or a financial analyst. This is only for educational and entertainment purposes. At this moment, I\u2019m currently YOLO long position on BNGO stock.***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pdqwax0f74571.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=01dbb54c8f428d75d3c4aa487d8b05bcb6953ab2\n\n***Hope you enjoy the read!
