As if there isn't 8000 other things going on that is accomplishing that just fine. **/disclaimer**\n\nLet's start with the SIPC's statement on hacks and how they affect what they insure: https://i.imgur.com/hKGC2Pg.png\n\nIf I'm reading that correctly, they don't? I've reached out for clarification in the event of a wide-spread hack/cyberattack but haven't heard back at the time of this post.\n\nSo.. with cyberattacks being a hot topic lately in the news I was thinking after close today; hypothetically, what if next week the market was halted? Say for an entire week. What would happen on the following Monday at market open?\n\nWould all derivatives that expired during the halt be worthless? Would the ensuing panic possibly get some very shady financial institutions out of some *very* big holes?\n\nWhat if brokerage's records become corrupted? Would Cede have the paper/digital records of who owned what and reimburse lost shares? Lost options? What happens to ITM strikes? \n\nThe World Economic Forum is holding their annual exercise to address and implement some actions in the event of such attacks on July 9th. It's called \"Cyber Polygon.\" Maybe someone more familiar with their event knows how well protected our securities are?\n\nhttps://www.weforum.org/projects/cyber-polygon\n\nIt's a huge what-if scenario that I'm sure is practiced against daily.. but it is a big damn \"what if?\"\n\nI'll list some articles below that caught my eye with regards to such a thing happening. If pipelines can be halted, and meat production facilities can be halted, and other country's exchanges can be halted in the name of \"cyber attacks,\" where do we stand as retail investors on the NYSE?\n\nHopefully WSB has some expertise in the matter.\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-04/how-a-dated-cyber-attack-brought-a-stock-exchange-to-its-knees\n\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/news/are-your-stocks-danger-getting-hacked/\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2021/04/14/could-the-next-stock-market-crash-be-potentially-caused-by-a-cyberattack/", "id": "o36gwp", "created_utc": 1624070955.0, "score": 16, "upvote_ratio": 0.62, "num_comments": 70, "comments": [{"body": "This is why I have money buried in coffee cans behind my house.", "score": 32, "replies": [{"body": "Safe place lol \n\n\nAt least safer than my money was in stocks this week.", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "Hi i am the prince from nigeria and would like to buy your house.

Since most of the financial business is based on ones and zeroes getting transferred around, let's assume they have a good one. That includes disaster recovery, which is hot sites, warm sites, and cold sites, where backups are stored and can roll back any data corruption or malware that may have taken place. When they're well prepared, these places are geographically separated and the cold sites are disconnected from any network. They're hardened against bombs and physical intrusion. They might lose recent data in the process of restoring it, but there's a lot of other mitigations that prevent a total loss of availability, such as having failover routes in case of network outages, multiple redundant servers that are geographically and virtually separated, creating accounts with the principal of least privilege and delegation of duties to remove the possibility that a single compromised account can do as much damage.\n\n\nBasically, if they have a good cybersecurity policy in place and pay those people well, any attack that will cause the kind of damage you're talking about would require multiple acts of war to accomplish. They lose more money (by the minute) by not having these protections if an attack would happen (because they make money by keeping the market open) than they would save by cutting corners. Class action lawsuits aside, the bigger players would each sue, individually,  for billions if they didn't have the necessary precautions in place and lost them big bucks.  One of the assurances you have about security in the stock market is that a lot of the unthinkably rich motherfuckers all have guns to each others' heads.
