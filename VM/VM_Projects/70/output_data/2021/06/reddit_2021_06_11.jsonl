{"title": "AAPL Jun 2023 $120.00 call x 20 contracts", "selftext": "Cost per contract:\n$23.40\n\nStock price at time of purchase (June 11, 2021):\n$127.15\n\nWhy:\nApple has remained flat for most of the past year. It first reached its current price in August 2020. Since then, much new hardware and software has been released, and the stock market has not yet responded favorably. \n\nBased on the latest swaths of advances unveiled at WWDC, I believe that this trend will end soon. Companies that take advantage of users\u2019 trust will look less appealing to investors. Meanwhile, more companies will become part of the Apple ecosystem when iOS 15 is rolled out to the general public, which will allow third-party cross platform use of Apple technology, like FaceTime, Apple TV, and Apple Music through newly announced SharePlay.\n\nI expect that people who sold AAPL last year and earned profits elsewhere in tech like GOOG, MSFT, AMZN, and FB will begin investing back into Apple. The outcomes of anti-trust trials and other lawsuits are unlikely to affect Apple severely in the next two years. However, investors might fear that competitors will become less profitable. \n\nAll of this, along with the consumer privacy awakening, stable quarterly revenue, growth of services like fitness+ and tv+, rumors of revolutionary products (and their anticipated future announcements), plus philanthropic investments in property (Bay Area housing), will make Apple look like a smart investing opportunity for the next 5 years.\n\nWhile some people may be bearish on this stock, it\u2019s important to remember we are only months away from an iOS 15 release, macOS Monterrey release, and the traditional September hardware release.\n\nExit strategy:\n- Sell or exercise 10 contracts at $53.45. Then exercise the remainder in two years.\n- Sell all immediately if at any point the value of contract decreases to $17.55.\n\nProof: https://imgur.com/gallery/CqarM1R", "id": "nxt9u1", "created_utc": 1623454459.0, "score": 35, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "num_comments": 97, "comments": [{"body": "Does it make sense to exercise leaps so early?
