To put this in perspective, Shopify did 2.9 billion in revenue with a 180 billion market cap. On top of that, Wish has 1.6 Billion in cash and no debt.

At $6, Wish is massively undervalued, and current prices are likely driven by a market overreaction to the Q2 earnings report and bearish all around short term market sentiment.
