Why aren't American investors taking any interest in the UK markets? Is the uncertainty around Brexit and the Union scaring people off? Or is it just that retail investors have never been interested in international stocks due to a lack of awareness/knowledge? Are there tax implications that make it cumbersome to invest internationally?

So the big money will be more reluctant to use this exchange.\n\nBrexit is definitely still a big factor, London used to essentially be the central financial hub for the whole EU but now that's being more spread out across the mainland. Plus there's still a lot of uncertainty on how it's going to affect trade and supply chains long term (not looking too good atm).\n\nThe strength of the \u00a3 vs the $ will have an affect.

Since the 08 crash with low interest rates and the banks being bailed out conditions have favoured the tech/growth companies much more. The FTSE 100 only grew past 08 prices recently (however as dividend yield is \\~double S&P it's not terrible).\n\nThe UK growth companies are generally found in the FTSE 250 which has performed similarly to the S&P since 08.\n\nOverall if interest rates stay low/conditions stay favourable for growth companies then US companies will almost certainly continue to outperform the UK/Europe.
