You've touched on a lot of problems, but for me Bob Chapek is a walking disaster that seems to fuck up everything he touches.\n\nNote that he took control at the end of last year if I remember correctly, and I don't think it's any coincidence that they're down 18% since then.\n\nHe's actively pissing off his creators (including Kevin Feige, the golden goose of Disney right now) and Bob Iger which are the people that made the brand what it is today. He's reported by insiders to be nickel and diming every single issue, which shows when you look at what happened with the ScarJo situation. There was no need for that to be as public as it was and it was handled disastrously. It's simply a situation that wouldn't have happened under Iger. He's actively taking away the control of the likes of Alan Horne and Feige and giving it to middle managers who don't know the industry because their experience is in banking, not entertainment. This has led to stupid decisions regarding Dinsey+ Premier access movies which have harmed industry relations as well.\n\nMore on the PR side, he was supposed to turn up at D23 (an event that was booked months in advance), however he bailed at the last minute because of \"scheduling conflicts\". What scheduling conflict comes up at the last minutes that prevents you from attending what is one of the most important dates in the Disney diary? Well, according to insiders, he was afraid of being booed off stage, because of how deeply unpopular he is.\n\nThen there's slightly more minor things which are indicative of the type of leader he is compared to Chapek. Such as the fact that he hasn't turned up to a single movie Premier since he has been CEO. Chapek went to every single one because he led from the front and wanted to support his creators. You can find pictures of him beaming with smiles along with them at practically every Premier. Chapek? He has \"scheduling conflicts\".\n\nWith regards to Shang Chi, when asked about the movie, all he said was \"it's an interesting experiment\" because of the fact they were releasing it with the 45 day theatrical window. That's literally all he had to say about the single biggest event film that had come out that year so far. One that had the potential to be another Black Panther level success (both commercially and culturally) if it weren't for COVID.\n\nThere's a whole host of other things I could go into (like why on Earth they continue to employ Kathleen Kennedy as Head of Star Wars), however it's easier if you just look at how the Disney Parks fans view the guy (seriously look it up). He managed the parks for years and those guys absolutely *loathe* him, and for good reason apparently.\n\nFull disclosure as well btw, I was fully bullish on Disney earlier this year.
