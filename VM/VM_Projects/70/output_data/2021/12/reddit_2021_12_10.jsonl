{"title": "Will inflation beat forecast , and will inflation become transitory again? I think so\u2026", "selftext": "Just a dumb ape\u2026 don\u2019t listen to me. Just buy some SPY calls\u2026\n\nHere\u2019s why. The DRY or Baltic Dry Index. The DRY basically tracks the shipping cost of dry goods or freight. It can be an indicator of inflation. The type of inflation we\u2019re experiencing is due to several things, surge in demand, lack of labor, and the ongoing supply chain issues, including shipping of goods. We all remember the story of all those ships waiting outside of San Francisco. We\u2019ll, ships waiting are down 30% (and I don\u2019t care about their new counting model, what matters is the amount of ships anchored within 40 miles because that\u2019s how it was counted in September and October\u2026).\n\nWith the assumption that this inflationary period is in-part caused by the supply chain, we can deduce that part of the inflation rate should be subject to the supply chain constraints. We\u2019ll, shipping has been by far one of the biggest supply chain hurdles for this pandemic rebound. \n\nDon\u2019t just take my word for it. Read this https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.wsj.com/amp/articles/inflation-definition-cause-stock-market-11637623703\n\nAnd this https://www.wsj.com/articles/supply-chain-problems-show-signs-of-easing-11637496002?st=uw2xw7xi63b9w14&reflink=article_copyURL_share\n\nSo where is this going? Let\u2019s compare inflation rates this year to the DRY. \n\nThis chart is inflation and we can see that it really took off around April.\n\n[Inflation Rate](https://d3fy651gv2fhd3.cloudfront.net/charts/united-states-inflation-cpi.png?s=cpi+yoy&v=202111101347V20200908&ismobile=1&w=400&h=250&lbl=0&d1=20201210)\n\nThen take a look at chart at the DRY. \n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.Dry\n\nThe Dry started to take off in April. So, did inflation. The DRY peaked in October. We\u2019ll, inflation was the highest since the early 1990\u2019s. I think this is a leading indicator that inflation has peaked. If this is true, then CPI can actually be lower in tomorrows November report, and certainly in Decembers report. Depending on how much lower it is, say it\u2019s back to 5.5 ish, I think JPOW will reintroduce the obligatory \u201cinflation is transitory\u201d phrase that has kept rising interest rates away and the Christmas rally continues.\n\nMoral to this story is that there may be some good news tomorrow.

{"title": "Electric Vehicles: A Bubble to be Burst?", "selftext": "https://www.theancienteconomist.com/post/electric-vehicles-a-bubble-to-be-burst\n\nElectric vehicles represent more than just a break from gasoline-powered modes of transportations; they illustrate the extremely high demand from consumers for further innovation. The electric vehicle industry, which now has a total market cap of nearly $1.3 trillion, has boomed with investments, in part due to Tesla's major success under the leadership of Elon Musk. However, this everlasting supply of interest seems to indicate that the industry as a whole may be in a bubble. We will look at recent news with regards to other EV companies as well as macroeconomic trends to give a proper diagnosis. \n\n\tRivian is an American electric vehicle maker that was founded in 2009 and went public through an IPO on November 10th at $100 per share. This has led Rivian stock ($RIVN) to reach a market cap of $116 billion, which is absurd considered the company has not earned any revenue yet. This large valuation is due in part to the success of Tesla, which has effectively skyrocketed to a global brand; investors ultimately are banking on Rivian's buz within the EV space. Their  growth projections are carrying the stock price to new heights, which leaves room for a sizeable correction if they do not meet their future plans.\n\n\tRivian has a variety of future objectives on their agenda that correspond with this seemingly overvalued price, such asproducing 25,000 vans per year by 2025 and building a manufacturing plant in Europe to start building vehicles by 2024. If they are unable to complete these goals that are the basis for investors piling cash into the company, then the company will subsequently see a major correction. The situation with Rivian is very reminiscient of the early 2000s bubble, where firms where being propped up on the market not on the basis of financial analysis or profits, but on hype. \n\n\n\tAlthough the fad of electric vehicles is not going anywhere anytime soon, the vast majority of the solely EV firms may eventually gain new competitors in the form of industry giants. GM has invested $35 billion in EV product development for new vehicles, while other manufacturers such as Mercedes Benz have announced brand new lineups for electric vehicles for 2022. Only time will tell whether secondary EV companies such as Rivian, Lucid Motors, and Nio will be able to scale as far as Tesla in regards to revenue and valuation.", "id": "rdk347", "created_utc": 1639174264.0, "score": 11, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "num_comments": 74, "comments": [{"body": "RIVN earnings next Thursday", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "Everyone holding RIVN already knows they have no revenue.
