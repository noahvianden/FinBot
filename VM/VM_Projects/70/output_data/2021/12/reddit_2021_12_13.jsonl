Think about it in terms of the debt payments. The reality is that the existing principal balances get rolled over continuously\u2026.so what is being repaid? Interest.\n\nThe US government makes interest payments on all the debt. Now there are a few factors to consider here. First is that the debt level continues to increase. So even if rates don\u2019t increase, the amount of interest that needs to be paid increases as well. Second, if interest rates DO increase on US debt then any new debt or existing debt that gets rolled over, costs more in interest Per dollar borrowed. \n\nSo you have a situation where every day the amount borrowed increases which increases interest payment obligations. Then if you increase interest rates, those interest payments end up increasing due to new debt issued at higher rates and existing, lower interest debt, rolling over at higher rates.\n\nThe reason I\u2019m ignoring principal in this response is that interest repayment is what is actually being paid out of the federal budget each year. \n\nIf the interest requirement DOUBLES next year and we refuse to default on the debt that means that the money will need to be taken from other places in the budget. This could cause services to be cut. \n\nThey could increase the budget, but to do that they either need to increase taxes materially or they need to borrow more debt. \n\nBut we just said that taking on more interest payments was what caused the budget problems, so at that point it doesn\u2019t really work as an option.\n\nSo massive tax increases.

{"title": "Puts on $LWLG: hedge fund managed share selling scam on a do-nothing company", "selftext": "Hello fuckers,\n\nToday I want to introduce you to another shitco on which luckily you can buy shitputs.\n\nBrief intro about myself: I'm a retard like you all, but when I don't waste hours [making video memes](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r8eboq/brief_recap_of_todays_market_action/), I sometimes write [killer DD on shitcos](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q7i6ot/hudson_bay_capital_hedge_fund_pulling_off_a_scam/), with extra focus on hedge fund managed scams. If you were smart enough to figure out the company (couldn't post the name of the company due to the 1.5B$ market cap rule - solution in the comments), you could have shorted or bought put at virtually any strike/expiration and made some honest money.\n\nFor the next one, fortunately, the ticker has been pumped enough to cross the WSB threshold! As I write this, the company is trading at a market cap north of 2B$. In case you missed the title, today's shitco is:\n\n# $LWLG\n\nThe company has been around since 1991, public since 2006, and named Lightwave Logic since 2008. For what they claim, the company focuses on the \"development of photonic devices\" or whatever else. But let's dig a little bit deeper into their business.\n\nThroughout this DD, I'll include info I found myself, as well as some from the SA report of:\n\n\\- Gold Panda (GP): Lightwave Logic Looks Overvalued Based On Fundamentals\n\n\\- White Diamond Research (WDR): Lightwave Logic Is A Tiny, Glorified Science Lab, Recent 500%+ Runup Is Without Substance\n\nI can't link them due to Reddit rules, but I recommend you have a look especially at WDR, excellent work on what a trash company this is.\n\n**So, you may ask, what does this company sell?**\n\nTheir revenue is consistently zero. This has been the case for at least 10 years (thanks WDR). If anyone has the patience, you're welcome to look for more zeroes in the past. 11 years ago, someone posted a junk article on SA, claiming:\n\n>For the last 7 years or so a small company named Lightwave Logic (LWLG) has been developing a new electro optical polymer material (EO polymer) that promises increased life for Moore\u2019s Law.\n\nSo, they started developing this stuff 18 years ago, and still have to sell anything. This is getting comical, to the point that of their 70+ patents and applications, some are [so old they'll soon expire](https://patents.google.com/?assignee=lightwave+logic&oq=lightwave+logic&sort=old).\n\n[Cumulative sales of LWLG's core product](https://preview.redd.it/uplh6n88wc581.png?width=1830&format=png&auto=webp&s=32f56b2520869d69792dcb0fc1d4bf2acd5bb1cb)\n\nTheir main product are shares. They [sell millions of them every year](https://ycharts.com/companies/LWLG/shares_outstanding) to their customers/bagholders, who are in turn rewarded with a [constant flow of PRs](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LWLG?p=LWLG) talking about the next investor conferences, their latest \"breakthrough\" or some award at random events they are attending.\n\n**Ok, but how did they do a +2,000% YTD?**\n\nThere must be something behind such a rally, right? Not really, except stock promotion. This appears to be happening with the blessing of $LWLG itself, as it all started with them [casually showing logos of companies](https://youtu.be/rcY5vhsWHKo?t=381) to which they \"planned to sell components\" mid-this year. These included the likes of $CSCO, Huawei, $NOK, and why not let's also throw in the logos of $AMZN, $GOOG and $VZ.\n\n[A few companies that have no interest in LWLG's products](https://preview.redd.it/vanascdbwc581.png?width=945&format=png&auto=webp&s=03c8797288e4b261c19fff59d8c123d24e3f1b07)\n\nYou can probably tell from $LWLG revenue how much interest there is from these companies to buy their products.\n\nFun stuff, looking at the YouTube account that posted this (likely an employee), I found [this gem in a March 2017 presentation](https://youtu.be/U60ijsAC70s?t=662).\n\n>The market is ready for our solution: it's scalable...and we have great timing  \n>  \n>Our technology platform is exactly what customers are looking for...\n\nThis was happening 4 and a half years ago. Great timing.\n\nThe stock has undergone a promotion campaign by [https://insiderfinancial.com/](https://insiderfinancial.com/) (through its website, twitter and youtube), which is famous for promoting OTC stock scams. A penny stock boiler room basically.\n\n**What's the thing with the hedge fund?**\n\nThere's this hedge fund called [Lincoln Park Capital](https://www.lpcfunds.com/). According to them, they are a:\n\n>Chicago-based *Investment* Group and Asset Management Firm focused on opportunistic investing in public and private companies\n\nNot so surprisingly, one of the first suggestions when typing it on google is \"Lincoln Park Capital pump and dump\". Their main business is signing agreements to purchase shares from shitcos, and then dumping them on retail bagholders. [Utopia Capital Research](https://utopiacap.com/lincoln-park-capital/?amp) took some time to go through a series of their pump and dumps, pointing out that such stocks have horrific yearly returns of -42%.\n\n(side note: considering going short the whole LPC scam portfolio)\n\nFortunately, we don't need to worry about $LWLG finances:\n\n[The intern preparing these slides forgot they shouldn't mention it](https://preview.redd.it/p1kkqrffwc581.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=d2bafd6485f127362c620cc785be839ce2bc4b61)\n\nTheir [previous pump and dump agreement](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2019/01/22/1703512/0/en/Lightwave-Logic-Inc-Secures-25MM-Common-Stock-Purchase-Agreement-with-Longstanding-Investor-Lincoln-Park-Capital-Fund-LLC.html) was for 25M$. [The latest one](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lightwave-logic-announces-33-0-million-financing-agreement-with-lincoln-park-capital-fund-301395039.html) came in on Oct. 7th. Following a few weeks of nothing, the stock price has suddenly started flying on no news. This is somewhat unusual, as LPC has the right to purchase shares at $9.16 (we are north of $18 now). Such agreements are typically very bearish, since they put the market buyer in a position of disadvantage. Wash sales? Stock promotion? I don't know.\n\nBut who knows, maybe LPC is genuinely investing in $LWLG, holding shares for the long run? That would fit well with their mission, as stated in their website:\n\n>long-term, win-win relationships where Lincoln Park incentives are aligned with the best interests of common shareholders\n\nWell, as you may have guessed, no chance on earth. A look at the [ownership structure as of Sep. 29th](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LWLG/holders?p=LWLG) reveals as much as 1.45% of the shares are held by institutions. LPC doesn't appear to be in the top 10, meaning they own less than 37k shares. I can see your shocked face expression.\n\nIt's also interesting to note that insiders appear to own 0.74% of the shares outstanding. Talk about having skin in the game.\n\nCan it get worse? Of course! $LWLG recently got into bed with H.C. Wainwright. This is another shit company that pumps junk stocks and then hits them with a share offering. Also, they're a larger player than LPC, and when they dump shares, they dump like there's no fucking tomorrow. I've previously fallen for some recommended by their analysts (Azurx biopharma and Eyegate pharmaceuticals, both renamed into other shit this year), which promptly turned out to be trash and were hit with an offering. In this case as well, a google search can help confirming HCW's great reputation for scams.\n\n[$LWLG recently went to one of their scam conferences](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lightwave-logic-present-h-c-014800849.html). Wouldn't be surprised if an offering is coming in the next few months.\n\n**Sounds like a solid investment so far, anything else?**\n\nThe management is either retarded or lying to shareholders. They state in their [most recent corporate update](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lightwave-logic-provides-third-quarter-133100829.html):\n\n>As of November 15, 2021, the Company's cash and cash equivalents are approximately $15 million, enabling it to finance operations through March 2023.\n\nFor the last two quarters, cash burn was north of 4M$. At the current rate, their reserves should run to zero some time between June and September 2022.\n\n**Why should I buy puts now?**\n\nThere's an event hosted by Oppenheimer tomorrow, at which [$LWLG will give a presentation starting at 10:45](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lightwave-logic-present-december-investor-133100984.html). Some dumbfucks on Twitter/stocktwits ([here just an example](https://twitter.com/atlsutiger/status/1468931900630880257)) believe they will announce a foundry partnership. It would sound somewhat improbable to me, considering they have participated in hundreds of these conferences, and consistently announced zero such things.\n\nIf the run-up is caused by retail investors interest, this may come crashing once the presentation turns out to be the usual nothing burger. If it's just wash sales, LPC could rugpull.\n\nIf you feel adventurous enough to bet on the presentation, based on all the shit you've read so far, there's puts for Dec. 17th (this Friday), which should well satisfy your gambling desires. If you typically hang out on r/investing, but somehow ended up today here on WSB, there's some for June 17th, 2022. By then, they would likely have started dumping shares.\n\n**IMPORTANT UPDATE: HUGE VOLUME IN DEC 17 17.5-20 PUTS**\n\nHad the brilliant idea of checking out the options volume for basically all the puts in existence. Turns out on Dec. 8th somebody purchased in a single order [\\~500x 17.5 puts](https://finance.yahoo.com/chart/LWLG211217P00017500#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) (premium: 1.1-1.3), and [\\~900x 20.0 puts](https://finance.yahoo.com/chart/LWLG211217P00020000#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) (premium: 2.45).

All these elaborate hypotheses could be invalidated if $LWLG announces a revenue-generating partnership, LPC decides starting tomorrow they'll hold all the shares they're buying, or whatever else.\n\nNot financial advice and all the usual crap.

In a way, you can think of the pluggable transceiver as a high-end analog of the adapters that plug into laptops to convert from USB to USB-C or HDMI, etc. Ciena makes transport systems that similarly have ports that our optics would plug into.", "score": 10, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.37750300765037537}, {"body": "Are you going to get some puts on this position as well?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "IDK seems really hard to determine anything.
