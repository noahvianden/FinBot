Pulling some math out of my ass, but lets say your 935C are 55 delta and your 1000C are 40 delta. This is a net of -90 delta. This then creates huge gamma risk because if TSLA rips to 1050, your 1000 calls are going to create a mass of losses.\n\nFor example:\n\n[https://optionstrat.com/build/custom/TSLA/220121C935x2,220121C1000x-5](https://optionstrat.com/build/custom/TSLA/220121C935x2,220121C1000x-5)\n\nThe risk with ratio spreads is that they are very solid when you are not getting blasted on the short side.

This is the reason why I only sell short dated ratio spreads (<10 days) and have a certain threshold at which I start to cover. Usually this is if I see the underlying breaching my long strike. \n\nThe caveat with this is that there aren\u2019t many tickers that are profitable in that timeframe (either that or the credit is too measly) so you\u2019d have to have a decent screening criteria set up. \n\nA good example of this was when LCID was trading in the 50s. I could sell the weekly 55/60 short call ratio 7 days out and sell to close it 2 days before expiry for more profit. I was lucky that the stock was so badly overbought/memed that call prices were crazy enough to drive up my profits and there was massive resistance at the 57 level. \n\nAnother trade that did not go so well for me was ADBE. sold 560/580 short put ratio spread prior to earnings. I knew I could have nailed this and maxed profited from it but I paper handed and closed out my trade when ADBE bottomed at 538 yesterday. I still profited but damn it hurts to know I left like 1k on the table. These get very difficult to manage when the underlying likes to make big swings in either direction and it throws your delta all over the place. \n\nCurrently I have a BB 1:3 short call spread 10/11 strike set up. I almost trade ratio spreads exclusively these days because their win rates are some of the highest I\u2019ve seen (above 90% usually).
