If AMD doubles in value they'll have a PE ratio around 20 which is \"normal\" for the semi conductor market, and they are expected to grow . This market is always growing, that's why high PE ratios are expected. While the sector has grown throughout the pandemic Intel's revenue has remained flat. Remaining flat in this environment is the same as going down. The only reason they are flat and not going down is because AMD can't produce enough product to take market share. AMD is projected to grow 30% next year, I believe they'll likely surpass that. You could say 30% growth is practically set in stone considering the major deals they've already announced. The reality is that their server product is light years ahead of Intel and what Amazon is trying to make.\n\nIntel has historically way outspent AMD in R+D and they still managed to fall behind, so I wouldn't say money alone can get them out of this. There is a reason they are trading at a 10 PE, everyone expects their revenue to go down. \n\nIf you truly believe in Intel (I don't, but there's a case to be made). Wait a year or two until they actually start losing the revenue that they are already predicted to lose, the market will likely overreact, and then buy LEAPs.
