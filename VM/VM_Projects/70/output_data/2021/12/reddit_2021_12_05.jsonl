And I almost always enjoy ingesting another well thought out opinion as well as a chance to respond. So here goes...\n\nSubsidies.\n\nTesla ran through it's federal tax credit in 2019. No Teslas sold in the US since then have seen any of that money. Ford however still has $7500 per vehicle. Tesla continues to ramp and sell Model Y like hotcakes and MachE has done something like 60k globally in 2021. Either everyone will eventually run out like Tesla and GM or everyone will get them back in the new BBB plan. I think the EV credits will come back and I don't think the UAW carve out will survive. Hopefully it goes away and grows the credit for made-in-America line item. It'll help the bottom line for sure and help the consumer, but it won't drive Teslas sales any faster. They're already running at capacity. Growing capacity is the issue.\n\nCapacity.\n\nThis is where everyone is feeling the pain. Battery cells are as good as gold. Tesla has the largest production volume and can negotiate the best prices from companies like LG, CATL, and Panasonic. VW, world renowned manufacturer is doing 1 BEV per 30 hours per assembly line in the newest highest tech factory. Tesla will be doing 1 per 10 hours in Berlin. Austin is going to come online and eventually triple or quadruple North American production. Shanghai is continuing to expand and will be at +1M installed capacity before 2H 2022. Berlin will handle domestic EU Model Y production which will lower shipping and tariff costs.\n\nNot to mention that Tesla is now producing their own in-house high performance cells which are going to be used in the Model Y's from Austin (which will likely be only Performance models for the time being) and the upcoming Cybertruck. These cells are not only advanced in their performance but also they're going to lower production costs even further.  \n\n\nEfficiency.\n\nWhen efficiency is king, Tesla wears the crown. And it matters because of range anxiety. People want longer ranges. And I'll lay it out why it matter SO DAMN MUCH when it comes to manufacturing. (I'm going to use very round figures for simplicity's sake) Say that you need to make a car with a 300 mile range and you have 1GWh of battery capacity to do it with. The more efficient car will use a 100kwh pack to get it done and you can make 10,000 vehicles. The less efficient vehicle will need 110kwh of cells and therefor you can only make 9,090 vehicles.\n\nThe company that makes fewer vehicles will also have a higher cost of goods sold and either a higher price or a lower profit margin. Their vehicle will be heavier, so it performs less well with all other things being equal. I've just laid out the Model Y/3 vs the MachE or ID3/4 or even the Plaid S vs Taycan.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut so much of all that is on the back end, the financials, the stock, etc. What's the consumer going to see in the next few years? They'll see some sedans, CSUVs, mid-size SUVs, pickups, etc coming from all the major players. Sure, no doubt. But they're going to see them in limited numbers. With insane dealership markups. They're going to see them online being compared to whatever Tesla has in the same market segment and they're going to compare specs and price. And that's why Tesla is winning now. And it's why they're going to keep winning. Because even if Tesla didn't have a head start, which they do - they're moving and innovating and improving so damn fast that no one is going to catch up.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Tesla has its margin and time advantage mostly because of minimalism. Yes you can produce a car faster but also you discourage buyers who want some uniqueness to their car. Tesla can\u2019t satisfy those consumers.

But that's not enough to get them where they are.\n\nTheir margins mostly are due to batteries and manufacturing. Using giga-castings is a huge part of that and lowers their cost to build factories by a large amount. No one else is able to use the cheaper and lower energy density LFP cells as effectively as Tesla. That means they can use lower cost batteries to get the same range as someone with using more kwh of more expensive cells.

They are just incompetent. GM has been selling the Bolt since 2017 and they had to recall every single one of them because the battery can spontaneously catch fire. Not only that, but GM has ceased production of the Bolt until February 2022. And Ford has delayed the F-150 Lightning until September 2022. I am confident that once those dates roll around that they will delay production even further. \n\nHow long can they last will the tens of billions of debt on their balance sheets?
