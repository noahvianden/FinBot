{"title": "New leaks/rumors regarding Teslas Giga Berlin factory (from Sawyer Merritt)", "selftext": "[Full text of the Twitter thread:](https://twitter.com/SawyerMerritt/status/1473045358783647746) \n\n* A source has informed me of the following regarding Teslas Giga Berlin factory:  Giga Berlin has built about 240 Model Y\u2019s so far, with another 25 or so planned to be built this week.\n* Some of the cars are for crash tests, weather toughness and watertightness stuff (for example in Norway) and some are for testing the recycling processes in the factory. Some of those already built are being used for internal transportation inside the factory.\n* Giga Berlin's working on launching 3 new paint colors, the names of which i have now independently confirmed, and they are Deep Crimson Multi-coat, Abyss Blue Multi-coat and Mercury Silver Metallic. I've seen several images up close of the Deep Crimson & it's gorgeous.\n* Giga Berlin will only ship Performance Model Y in black and white for now, and if paint goes well then other colors will follow.\n* Tesla hopes to deliver its first Giga Berlin made cars to customers around mid January, but this depends on whether Germany gives them the necessary approvals in time, which is a big if.\n* Going back to paint, The 3 new colors will have 8 total layers I\u2019m told. The current higher end Tesla paints I believe are 5 or 6 layers total so the new colors will be getting up to a few additional coats, which will really make the colors pop and give them some great depth.\n* Giga Berlin Model Y\u2019s currently have a mix of 16v and 12v batteries so i\u2019m not sure if they\u2019ll launch with a mix or just 16v.\n* Berlin will build 2170 packs in the beginning with structural version launching later in 2022. \u2022 Model Y will launch with front & rear castings.\n* Finally, Giga Berlin is pretty much ready to rock, but is waiting for final approval. Once they do receive that final approval, I'm told Tesla could start pumping out cars in as little as 2 weeks. Everything I've seen, Giga Berlin is truly a next-gen factory.
