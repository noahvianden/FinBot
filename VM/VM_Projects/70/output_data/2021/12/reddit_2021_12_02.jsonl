She loves math and company financials was right up her alley. The biggest thing I learned was how to identify demand. And at the time everyone around me wanted iPhones and played call of duty or fifa games religiously.

It\u2019s very profitable but it\u2019s very distracting and it was causing me to miss living in the present day sometimes. At times I was absolutely to stingy and it probably cost me friendships with good people. \n\nMy financial advice to you is stick most of it in index funds and the rest in long term plays. Then focus on what you want to do with your life long term. Focus on finding something you love doing and chase it. \n\nCreate a monthly budget of your expenses and goals. Once you\u2019re hitting those goals you\u2019ll see how much you have available to spend for yourself and actually going out and living. I\u2019m not talking about burning $200 on a night out at a shitty college club.

And trust me, I was making that mistake a lot. \n\nLife advice, don\u2019t be afraid to be yourself. Start by finding people who you enjoy being around and genuinely like being around you. It\u2019ll be a struggle at first but eventually you\u2019ll find your crew. In college I was constantly hanging around people going out meeting friends.
