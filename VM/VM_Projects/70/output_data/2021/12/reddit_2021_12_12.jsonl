{"title": "FedEx heading into the shits? Discussion with some DD", "selftext": "**TL;DR**\n\nI think FedEx\u2019s earnings are going to tank because of their inability to control costs related to the labor shortages compared to their competition and that you can make tendies on puts or shorts, but this probably won\u2019t be the next DOCU play\n\n**Preface:**\n\nAll over the world logistics companies are facing labor shortages and increased shipping loads, on top of the ports being backed up especially a bad thing for courier companies for this quarter since Christmas shopping is in full swing and shopping for tendies online is at an all-time high thanks to covid.\n\n**FedEx\u2019s shipping rate hikes but why I think they mean nothing:**\n\nLast earnings, FedEx announced an increase in rates but it would only take effect on Jan. 3, 2022, these will apply to all US domestic, US export and US import services. FedEx Ground, which delivers to businesses, and FedEx home delivery will increase by an average of 5.9%. FedEx Freight customers could see an increase of up to 7.9%.\n\nEarlier this month starting Nov.1, FedEx also announced that a fuel surcharge will be added to certain FedEx shipments, including FedEx Express, FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight shipments. Effective Nov. 15, 2021, Item 525 Over Length and Item 530 Extreme Length surcharges will also increase.\n\nThis rise in rates are always expected due to the build-up of the end of year shipping rush, but I think these rate hikes have come too late as it will only partially offset their fuel costs.\n\n**Labour shortages and increased hiring cost problems:**\n\nTaking data from this news report from Convey a few weeks back:\n\n[https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/convey-project44-fedex-ups-postal-service-delivery-on-time/610456/](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/convey-project44-fedex-ups-postal-service-delivery-on-time/610456/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ On-time performance for retail final-mile deliveries ](https://preview.redd.it/dqth65drk2581.png?width=687&format=png&auto=webp&s=42097386582e6c8e22f27cecb536ee1ef28889a9)\n\nWe can see that FedEx has all along been pretty fucked in terms of their labor problems as this has making them consistently fail in their on-time deliveries. I will explain more on why I think this is relevant below.\n\nBesides the chaos, we still have headlines of FedEx employees dumping packages probably thanks to the insane pile up of packages at this time of the year.\n\n[https://www.al.com/news/2021/11/hundreds-of-fedex-packages-found-in-blount-county-ravine.html](https://www.al.com/news/2021/11/hundreds-of-fedex-packages-found-in-blount-county-ravine.html)\n\n[https://www.newsweek.com/fedex-investigates-after-hundreds-packages-found-alabama-ravine-1653209](https://www.newsweek.com/fedex-investigates-after-hundreds-packages-found-alabama-ravine-1653209)\n\n**Flip-side argument from Shipmatrix but why its bullshit**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Boomer ShipMatrix reports Fedex being on time](https://preview.redd.it/x1xv2viel2581.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0d04a810f359c95c0901d5e5b462a4a83c016837)\n\nSource:\n\n[https://about.ups.com/be/en/our-stories/customer-first/ups-leading-the-industry-in-on-time-performance.html](https://about.ups.com/be/en/our-stories/customer-first/ups-leading-the-industry-in-on-time-performance.html)\n\nBoomer shipmatrix.com disagrees with Convey\u2019s reporting matrix and is instead reporting much better on-time deliveries because they use the total time in transit rather than accounting for when each individual courier receives, processes and then delivers each package.\n\nI wont be going into the specifics here but I personally think ShipMatrix is more retarded than the average WSB autist here.\n\nI don\u2019t know anyone who can even agree with these bullshit numbers that they are pulling out of their ass.\n\nA quick sub-reddit research seems that there\u2019s more chaos over in /r/Fedexers/ vs that of UPS /r/UPSers\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Fedexers/comments/rdrr87/nice/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fedexers/comments/rdrr87/nice/)\n\n[FedEx - December 2021](https://preview.redd.it/yph45uv2l2581.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5259fd887d490072dfc860cfdeae9fcaceb36d4c)\n\n**Why do any of these numbers matter?**\n\nNot being able to deliver on time had already led to them losing contracts with time sensitive meal-kit businesses, as noted during its last earnings it lost customers such as Clean Eatz Kitchen Inc. due to delays that cost the company thousands of dollars\u2019 worth of shipments of ready-to-eat frozen meals that ended up spoiled in transit.\n\nNext up on some meal-kit business that will lose or have already lost their contract with Fedex:\n\n1. Home Chef - Users grumbling on facebook & reddit\n2. Sun Basket \u2013 users are reporting that they have already switched away from Fedex to Courier Express (not a listed company so who cares)\n\nA quick look into any of the meal kit subreddits or a quick google has angry customers complaining about long delays of even up to a week in receiving their meal kits. Can you imagine what happens if you let fresh foodstuff sit in a warehouse with no temperature controls for 3 days, what happens after 5? What happens if that week\u2019s kit has seafood?\n\nTake a look here and you can see nothing but disdain for FedEx in relation to meal kit deliveries.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/mealkits/comments/qgskut/dinnerly\\_ship\\_late\\_for\\_anyone\\_else/](https://www.reddit.com/r/mealkits/comments/qgskut/dinnerly_ship_late_for_anyone_else/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/mealkits/comments/q27btx/latecancelled\\_deliveries\\_venting/](https://www.reddit.com/r/mealkits/comments/q27btx/latecancelled_deliveries_venting/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/bullcity/comments/r8rfgn/any\\_meal\\_delivery\\_companies\\_that\\_dont\\_use\\_fedex/](https://www.reddit.com/r/bullcity/comments/r8rfgn/any_meal_delivery_companies_that_dont_use_fedex/)\n\nHow many of you personally ordered tendies but they came in late because of FedEx?\n\n**Non food related delivery problems also extend into delays of delivery of sensitive documents**\n\n[https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/hundreds-hit-passport-delays-even-25551792](https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/hundreds-hit-passport-delays-even-25551792)\n\nOver at the UK side, FedEx is also fucking up on passport deliveries.\n\n**Possibly higher Labor costs vs their peers:**\n\nI remember reading FedEx is also paying more for labor acquisitions than their peers at DHL/UPS/USPS etc but I haven't gone and dug up more about it beyond this news report.\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-04/labor-shortage-ups-union-drivers-give-delivery-service-edge-over-fedex-fdx](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-04/labor-shortage-ups-union-drivers-give-delivery-service-edge-over-fedex-fdx)\n\n**Summary**\n\nFedEx is reporting that they expect higher shipment volume but the increase in revenues wont be high enough to cover their rising costs since they can't even handle the current volume with the current labor shortage. They have also been lagging behind their peers in managing costs possibly leading into an earning's miss and tanking the share price further.\n\nI will likely be picking up puts come market open after I get more allowance from cashing in my good boy points with Mommy.\n\n\\*edit\\*\n\nFedex's share price when put against its peers UPS, DHL and Maersk also seems correlated to its poor ability to deliver.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6dbnf73ee3581.png?width=1551&format=png&auto=webp&s=369f55657abc84a6a8030f8b96e783dd963d6e8d\n\n**The Play**\n\nPuts or shorts for potential earnings miss.\n\n\\*edit\\*\n\nIV pretty low currently so we won't be fucked on option plays\n\n**Risk**\n\n\u2013 Share price has already tumbled from its ATH levels of $314 earlier this year.
