{"title": "Blue Apron: Hero or Zero", "selftext": "This isn\u2019t what you think. I\u2019m not going to pitch a shit short interest play or prattle on about some pipe dream. No. I\u2019m going to introduce you to an ultra-high-risk micro-cap play that, very well might be on the precipice of greatness.\n\n\nWhat is Blue Apron?\n\n\nBlue Apron (NYSE: APRN) was the forgotten step child, bad luck Brian, IPO of summer 2017 that priced below range and had the misfortune of debuting after Amazon bought Whole Foods. Since it\u2019s debut, the stock has suffered dropping from nearly $150 per share (adjusted for a 2019 reverse-split necessitated to stay listed) to as low as approximately $2.00!\n\n\nWhy the Drop?\n\n\nManagement. Fucking. Sucked. The prior executive team essentially handed Chad Hello Fresh the keys to the kingdom, when they made the fatal error of betting that the \u201chigh affinity core users\u201d would be enough to sustain the business. For this reason, they cut marketing to nearly nothing and attempted to realize operating leverage by shrinking the customer base only to its most prolific buyers.\n\nThis was stupid. HelloFresh did the opposite, essentially giving away meals, and they used it to stockpile market share. Put a chart up of HelloFresh customers against Blue Apron. You\u2019ll see the two lines converge and a clear indication that HelloFresh stole most of their business. HelloFresh was one of the best trades of the past 5 years. Look at the chart, look at the sales, and look at the margins. They have managed to achieve operating leverage by employing affordable pricing and emphasizing retention.\n\n\nBlue Apron Might Go Under....\n\n\nToday the company is in a dire place. Languishing away in Micro Cap hell at an $80M market cap, no one on Wall Street wants to cover these guys. Only their bankers, CG and MS, write them research and neither are overly optimistic. They\u2019re in a shit spot with a credit line that mandates they keep $15M cash at all times, and they keep their customer base above 300K (thus far, they\u2019ve struggled). They\u2019re sitting on $29M and burn enough cash per Q that they might go below that $15M level (wouldn\u2019t be a first). All signs are negative...\n\n\nBut I Think They Might Win\n\n\nBlue Apron is under new management. Linda Kozlowski, is the former COO of ETSY and an ex-strategist at Alibaba. She believes HelloFresh did things right and she wants to right the ship. Her ballsy-ass plan is to ride the line on cash and go all in on customer growth. She realizes those customers are worth a lot more than income on the P&L, and that she needs to make the pot as big as she can. Thus far, it\u2019s worked. Customers are up over 20% in the past two periods and retention rates are rising. We are seeing signs of operating leverage, and it opens a big possibility.\n\n\nMy Prediction\n\nManagement is buying shares. They know the company is not healthy. The only logic is that they have a plan that\u2019s working. You can\u2019t sell a dying business with a shrinking share, but you can certainly sell a growing community, that could be an accretive asset to a better capitalized entity. I think Linda is going either get the business in a position where it can refinance for better terms, or where it can be sold to create shareholder value via a strategic alternative.\n\nIf that happen, given this is priced for bankruptcy and ignored by the Street, the returns could easily reach the triple digits. I\u2019m long and I plan to add on additional weakness.\n\nDisclosure- I\u2019m buying a stock that might go under. This is not advice!

I also need to read the 8K about their new debt covenant, and one or two other things. I did notice one or two things I liked, however. \n\nWith the market cap of this company as small as it is, any meaningful shareholder appreciation in a very quick manner will lead to new share issuances, diluting existing shareholders, for one. They need the cash, and they need it badly. \n\nAnother thing i noticed, is that they are all about being positive EBITDA wise, but that doesn't help when we're talking about net income. And I don't see even how they become Cash Flow Positive on an EBITDA basis anyways.\n\nWith that said, they have a lot of money in inventory, and in pre-paid expenses, so they have a bit of runway still.\n\nI'll update with my observations tomorrow, probably.", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "I\u2019ve read all of their 8Ks, listened to their past several earnings calls, and I keep a model. I typed this on my phone so unfortunately so I didn\u2019t get to be as detailed as I wanted.\n\nThey previously had EBITDA covenants which they breached. I believe they refinanced last year for this very reason. In fact, they\u2019ve already breached their current covenants by going under $20M during 1Q. That\u2019s why it\u2019s been revised down to $15M.\n\nThe company enjoyed a pretty strong pull-forward in demand last year, but it wasn\u2019t positioned to capitalized on it. They were already in a state of making the business lean and they didn\u2019t have the resources to drive improvements in retention, rates. They were also hit by labor shortages, which caused increases in opex and further prevented the realization of operating leverage.\n\nI don\u2019t view dilution here as a major negative. When you bet on micro caps, you\u2019re essentially betting a person is going to drive a turnaround in a broken business, and that\u2019s what this is. We need flexibility to be able to focus on the growth initiative without being saddled by that debt. Oh, and before you waste time on the 8K, it\u2019s $15M at all times and over 320K customers. There are also a bunch of warrants associated with the offering (dilutive), at $0.01 per share. Again, bad signs.\n\nLook at HelloFresh. It started smaller than Blue Apron and it\u2019s now a $15B company with high top-line growth rates. The negative risk factors for blue apron, low competitive moat, low switching cost, etc extend to them, so a campaign focused on low margin customer acquisition would be effective.\n\nRegarding timing, I\u2019ll save you some extra effort, as it\u2019ll also have to be soon. They\u2019re within the danger zone assuming their current cash burn remains constant. They\u2019ve resolved many of their labor cost issues that drove expenses last year, so they estimate $2M at least will drop off the burn, but we\u2019ll see what actual impact it had in August. Anyway, they\u2019re coming up on headwinds from reopening reducing demand with more people wanting to travel and they\u2019re also facing the worst seasonality for margins given the challenges of shipping perishable goods across the nation during the warmest months of the year.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a \u201cwait and see what happens\u201d deal, it\u2019s a near-term event where it\u2019s either going under, or they\u2019re going to find a way to continue on. I think it\u2019s likely that, if they can continue to grow the customer base, they\u2019re able to successfully execute on a strategic alternative. The fact is, I don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to be able to refi the debt or issue enough equity as the current conditions stand. Maybe they can find someone to do a PIPE offering, or ATM, but I think they\u2019re going to be in a position where they sell to a better capitalized business. A big reason I believe this is that they\u2019re so close to that cash covenant (again), but they\u2019re still full throttle on growth. Usually a company in this stage would be aggressively trimming costs down to the bone, unless there was a reason not to be concerned. If you see any off-cycle sell-side research from Maria or Brian (or better yet a new analyst) that\u2019s also a good clue that banking activity is up.\n\nIMO- you can\u2019t use traditional fundamentals to judge a micro cap stock. That\u2019s how it got here. At this point it\u2019s more prudent to use mosaic theory and anecdotal evidence as to how it can come back and what form that would take. The fundamentals totally point to bankruptcy, you\u2019re right, but look at their announcement in Feb 2020 and compare it to their actions today.
