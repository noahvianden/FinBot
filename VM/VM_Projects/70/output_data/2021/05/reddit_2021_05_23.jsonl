{"title": "I built a program that tracks mentions and sentiment of stocks across Reddit and Twitter! This week's most discussed and top growing stocks!", "selftext": "This post is in continuation of a series of posts I made in the previous weeks. You can find the last week's post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nds2vh/i_built_a_program_that_tracks_mentions_and/). The response I received was amazing and a lot of you were asking for continued weekly updates. So here goes!\n\n**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rc961bm4hv071.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=4701a99fd4471a560552f895ebcc817e72e334d3\n\nGME continues to retain its number 1 position as the most discussed stocks. AMC has made huge strides in conversation volume over the past two weeks going from 7th position to 2nd position. Investor sentiment in Tesla is muted given the continuous drop the stock has faced over the last month and its controversial decision of dropping \\[Redacted\\] as a payment option.\n\nNewcomers to the top 10 list are Lordstown Motors and Ford. Ford was trending due to the unveiling of their new electric truck, F-150 Lightning whereas RIDE seems to be making a comeback after the drastic decline due to the short-seller report (the stock had dropped from $30 to $7 within 3 months)\n\n**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k4xmo4x0hv071.png?width=1106&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce0062bb7d45593b31f4660f4e328b1265bebf56\n\nAbove is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media.\u00a0We definitely have some interesting stocks on the list.\n\n**Western Digital($WDC) and Seagate Technology($STX)** were both trending due to reports of skyrocketing demands for high-capacity drives used to create \\[redacted\\], a new \\[redacted\\] started by Bram Cohen. While the full-scale impact of this is still not visible, investors are expecting an increase in demand for storage devices. The obvious downside to this play is that the newly issued currency can be overpriced and can completely die out making this sudden increase in demand just a momentary spike.\n\n**Fisker($FSR)** has made numerous headlines in recent days. The stock is up almost 20% in the last week. Fisker\u2019s Ocean electric SUV is attractively priced at $30K making it an electric SUV for the masses (though it\u2019s slated for production in late 2022). The company has generated more than 11,000 pre-orders for its product and is also set to make the first all-electric papal transport for the Pope.\n\n**Ford($F)** was trending as the company introduced their new electric F-150 Lightning pickup. Ford\u2019s CEO Jim Farley has said that the truck would be a test as to whether mainstream Americans truly want electric vehicles. The Truck has got more than 44K reservations in less than 48 hours which pushed the stock price even further. One major aspect driving the interest is price, with the base model costing just $40K before any federal tax credits.\n\nSOME FAQ\u2019s:\n\nHow does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about in the stock is positive or negative).\n\nWhat is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively.  The numbers you are seeing here are the average across all the comments.\n\nThank you for reading!\n\n*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor.*", "id": "nj7tco", "created_utc": 1621776679.0, "score": 288, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 79, "comments": [{"body": "Cool OP, make a inverse WSB sentiment", "score": 51, "replies": [{"body": "I\u2019d also love an inverse Cramer and inverse Cathie", "score": 21, "replies": [{"body": "Basically inverse CNBC, get on it OP", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "I actually use CNBC as a counter indicator.
