(Brazilian variant) in preclinical models. These results demonstrate the potential of INOVIO's Pan-COVID-19 vaccine to induce cross-reactive immune responses against current and emerging viral variants as either a first-line vaccine, or potentially as a boost for individuals previously immunized with various Wuhan-matched vaccines.  \n\n\nDr. Laurent M. Humeau, INOVIO's Chief Scientific Officer, said, \"INOVIO is taking a dual-track approach in developing a COVID-19 vaccine because we recognize the need to support both pandemic and endemic considerations. In addition to our work on INO-4800, which we expect to enter a global Phase 3 trial this summer, we are also developing our next-generation Pan-COVID-19 variant vaccine, INO-4802, which is designed to protect against current and potentially future variants of concern. The study data we report today confirms our two-tiered development path is the best strategy for the short- and long-term fight against this virus.\"  \n\n\nFirst-generation COVID-19 vaccines were matched against the original Wuhan strain. These vaccines may have reduced efficacy against emerging COVID variants. In response, many of the next-generation vaccines under development are matched to a single variant currently circulating. INOVIO's Pan-COVID-19 vaccine approach is designed to provide cross-strain protection, immune coverage, reduced susceptibility to escape mutants, and non-restricted geographical use against both known and potentially unknown variants. Preclinical data with INO-4802 in multiple models revealed both broader and increased levels of neutralizing antibodies against a panel of variants than strain-matched vaccines. Building on this initial work, INOVIO plans to conduct Phase 1/2 clinical trials this year with INO-4802.  \n\n\nTo create INOVIO's Pan-COVID-19 vaccine candidate, variant sequences were identified over a four-month period starting in October 2020 from multiple geographic regions (Brazil, Canada, India, Italy, Japan, Nigeria, South Africa, United Kingdom, and the United States). Mutations in the spike sequences were aggregated for each region. The sequence results from these regions were then further engineered to determine a common set of overlapping mutations from emerging variations in the COVID spike protein sequences to generate INO-4802.  \n\n\nMore information from this pre-clinical study can be found in the paper entitled: \"Design and immunogenicity of a Pan-SARS-CoV-2 synthetic DNA vaccine,\" which has been published as a preprint in BioRxiv prior to peer review.", "id": "naprqd", "created_utc": 1620829106.0, "score": 75, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 76, "comments": [{"body": "My 2 cents: from what I've seen with J&J, Pfizer, and Moderna, vaccine development is priced in when its still rumor.

That's a unknown unknown that can happen at any time during any downturn. Does that mean we would jump to this conclusion at any time the markets go down?

How is it predictive? Squiggles = squiggles obviously mind your business (or send me a message and we can talk about option nerd shit).\n\nIn any case as it is now, the stock price is being dominant by options' gamma. This is particularly concerning given its current state, more on that below.\n\nLooking at the expected moves recently:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8ukyrc0sxky61.jpg?width=1100&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0290c477d1d9bcd21fa8450d4c4e0e266d44826a\n\nHere we see its been doing any and everything possible via hedging to just break even at the bottom band that is associated with expected daily market moves by the option's dealers. Go below that band and things get c R a Z Y .  Its been dipping below that band huh?\n\nBut that isn't even the fun part about this stock - no. Not in the least. But baby steps. Then we look at the options landscape:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mpf2j2b1yky61.jpg?width=1128&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9a044161fc0b38dd28adf258daa47e67d6267538\n\nWhat a weird activity it must be for some, buying or selling 250,000 1$ puts on a $600 stock. \n\nTSLA has never really been a shorted stock recently so no use looking at that data its pretty benign. \n\nBut let's tie it all together with this statistic: APPROXIMATELY 10% OF ALL OTM CALLS ARE DEALER LONG. What does that mean? It means APPROXIMATELY 90% OF ALL OTM CALLS ARE DEALER SHORT. \n\nWhy is that an issue?\n\nYa'll love gamma squeezes. Currently TSLA has arppox. the following:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t53whiyiyky61.jpg?width=1011&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2c84a5a079337ff0b53605b9b2e755f97e53fc36\n\nThis equates to: for every 1 point decrease in price, 1.5 Million shares have to be sold. I'll repeat that so you slow fucking dunces can get it in your heads. Y'ALL BOUGHT SO MANY CALLS THAT IT IS NOW NEGATIVE GAMMA EXPOSED TO THE ORDER OF 1.5 MILLION SHARES PER POINT. \n\nThe issue being that with positive price days (like today) there had to be 27million shares purchased to hedge the options - but the liquidity isn't, and has never really, been there for this.(Also - if 27million shares had to be purchased just from gamma, how much of today was *really* investor confidence?). This caused volatility to rise. What happens when volatility rises? Oh the options have to be hedged again with 3.5million shares of selling. Thus any upside is hindered, and downside propagated.\n\nThat might explain why volatility has recently sky-rocketed (it is not normal to have \\~+10% vol in 3days, kids). Has it entered the doom-spiral? Hard to say. The only benefit is with decreases in volatility, approximately 3.5million options have to be hedged via  purchasing; this occurs lately when the price drops. This does provide a bit of cushion for the stock. \n\nBut right now TSLA is in a precarious position. \n\nTL;DR: THE DIP AINT HERE YET AMIGOS", "id": "nabs68", "created_utc": 1620778516.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.37, "num_comments": 75, "comments": [{"body": "all this dd n ur still gey", "score": 24, "replies": [{"body": "Bb don\u2019t judge just come over and sit on my lap.", "score": 7, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.28280606865882874}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1682920753955841}, {"body": "Loaded with shares and LEAPS.", "score": 17, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.11964724957942963}, {"body": "There is nothing about TSLA stock that makes sense.

It is computationally quite expensive but worth it as the raw data is expensive (tens of thousands a month) and bulky. And that is just the foundation of the process: once you've established the ratios that most closely match (I only accept values that are <10 %-different, with the mean around 3% with my current methodology - but this can be improved upon if you want to spend more computing time) you can start having a lot of fun.", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": ["mmm", "aapl"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1749710738658905}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.09839459508657455}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.38236159086227417}, {"body": "\ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08\ud83e\uddf8", "score": 5, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1797221451997757}, {"body": "STONKSSSSSSSSSSSS", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.19398978352546692}, {"body": "They say don\u2019t time the market but damn if I didn\u2019t luck into doing so damn near perfect.

{"title": "Cleveland Cliffs CLF commodity super cycle play.", "selftext": "Hello boys and girls since my last post CLF has raised it's price tag by a large margin. To those who bought in on my previous post congratulations! For those of you who have yet to buy in let me give you some more Information as to why you should. My position is 237 shares and 20 call options spread throughout the year.\n\nIll point you to the same chart I did last time [https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/steel](https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/steel) as you can see it still shows 0 sign of slowing down anytime soon. But aside from this chart lets talk about some recent events to prove why this chart is true.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Berkshire hathaway share holder meeting**\n\nWarren Buffet himself talked about how they keep seeing raising commodity prices. He talked about how steel prices kept going up everyday. He used the example that general motors has to keep paying more for steel everyday. He said the economy is red hot!\n\n**China steel rebate officially drops to 0%**\n\n[https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/metals/042821-china-removes-vat-rebate](https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/metals/042821-china-removes-vat-rebate-on-steel-exports-cuts-tax-on-raw-material-imports-to-zero) previously I spoke about how China was just talking about this being a possibility of this happening. However this has now happened. It being so recent it has yet to really have a massive effect on steel trade. However as the last of many companies steel reserves go empty they are going to have to eventually purchase more from China. This will not only increase China's export profitability since many countries were trying to compete with China's steel prices they will no longer have to and be able to keep marking prices up as the super cycle continues through the year. No more price competition on steel will simply drive prices further through the roof since \"cheap steel\" no longer exists.\n\n**Steel demand continually on the rise while supply cannot keep up with demand.**\n\n[https://www.hellenicshippingnews.com/worldsteel-raises-2021-steel-demand](https://www.hellenicshippingnews.com/worldsteel-raises-2021-steel-demand-growth-forecast-to-5-8/) Another very recent article talking about how steel demand is affecting multiple sectors in the industry. Covid-19 put a large halt on steel demand now that the great reopening is happening across many countries demand is revving up as steel mills have to ramp up production to the nines because they did not produce as heavily in a low demand market.\n\n**Summer construction season.**\n\nMany roads and bridges as we all know are worked on exclusively in the summer months. Not many companies have large reserves of rebar just lying around. As time goes on the prices are only going to go higher. These companies will have no choice other than to pay these ridiculous prices. Creating stronger demand as we go into these summer months.\n\n**CLF beat Q1 earnings expectations**\n\nJust a little icing on the cake [https://www.bizjournals.com/cleveland](https://www.bizjournals.com/cleveland/news/2021/04/22/cleveland-cliffs.html) they beat expected earnings by 2 cents EPS.
