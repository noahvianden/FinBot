By using Amazon Prime to corral an ever-larger share of online shoppers, Amazon has left rival retailers and manufacturers with little choice but to become third- party sellers on its platform; in addition, half of all online searches begin with Amazon. In effect, Amazon is supplanting an open market with a privately controlled one, giving it the power to dictate the terms by which its competitors can operate, and to effectively levy a kind of tax on their revenue.\nAmazon leverages the interplay between the direct retail and platform sides of its business to maximize its dominance over suppliers. As Amazon extracts more fees from suppliers, it reduces their ability to invent and develop new products. Meanwhile, Amazon is rapidly expanding its own product lines, using the trove of data it gathers from its platform to understand its suppliers\u2019 industries and compete directly against them. Many of these Amazon products appear at the top of its search listings.\nIncreasing prices once the consumer is hooked. Already there\u2019s evidence that Amazon is using its huge trove of data about customers\u2019 buying habits to raise prices.

I\u2019ve ordered from them before and all but one time did I receive the wrong item.

IMHO Wish\u2019s true value is its marketing algorithms and use of data & relevancy, and I think it\u2019s really misunderstood because everyone associated it with Chinese crap. I mean who doesn\u2019t own something from China?? But imagine how they\u2019re able to achieve such revenue and GMV numbers, especially if they\u2019re selling cheap crap from China which I can probably assume has a low transaction value on average. That means to make $2-3bn in revenue, imagine the level of volume of transactions on their platform and number of packages being shipped daily. This company\u2019s technology can literally sell you shit from China over and over again and make billions in revenue with decent growth year over year. That, IMO, isn\u2019t fuken easy. It\u2019s not perfect since I know s&m cost needs to be contained, but it\u2019s part of maturing their tech/business. But they prove their tech can sell \u201cjunk\u201d, it can find the right buyers in the right country with the right pocket cash to spend on something from china. I know it sounds ridiculous but I mean if you can make billions by getting people to repeatedly buy crap straight from China, imagine what else they can do down the road. \n\nTLDR; IMO I think Wish has growing pains but they got cash and tech to improve. I think their technology is the real value here and e-commerce is just medium to show off how powerful their marketing tech is, which will open doors to more opportunities down the road.", "score": 7, "replies": [], "tickers": ["amzn"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Wish - omg.

(WISH) investors with significant losses to submit your losses now. A securities class action is pending and certain investors who purchased shares in the company\u2019s December 2020 IPO or on the open market may have valuable claims.\n\nClass Period: Dec. 13, 2020 \u2013 May 12, 2021\nLead Plaintiff Deadline: July 16, 2021\nVisit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/WISH\nContact An Attorney Now: \tWISH@hbsslaw.com\n \t844-916-0895\nContextLogic Inc. (WISH) Securities Class Action:\n\nThe complaint alleges that ContextLogic\u2019s IPO registration documents materially overstated the company\u2019s business metrics and financial prospects. Specifically, the IPO registration documents touted ContextLogic\u2019s exponential monthly active user (MAUs) growth, claiming its then108 million MAUs was a key driver of revenue growth.\n\nIn reality, by the time of its December 2020 IPO, ContextLogic\u2019s MAUs had declined materially and the IPO registration documents failed to disclose this known trend reasonably likely to materially impact ContextLogic\u2019s profitability.\n\nOn Mar. 8, 2021, Context reported disappointing 4Q 2020 and full year 2020 results, disclosing its MAUs had already \u201cdeclined 10% YoY during Q4 to 104 million.\u201d\n\nThen, on May 12, 2021, ContextLogic (WISH) announced poor Q1 2021 results, including another 7% drop in MAUs to just 101 million, and the company slashed sales guidance for Q2 2021.\n\nThese disclosures caused the price of WISH shares to decline sharply.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re focused on investors\u2019 losses and proving ContextLogic (WISH) overstated MAUs and concealed known trends,\u201d said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation.\n\nIf you are a ContextLogic (WISH) investor and have significant losses, or have knowledge that may assist the firm\u2019s investigation, click here to discuss your legal rights with Hagens Berman.\n\nWhistleblowers: Persons with non-public information regarding ContextLogic (WISH) should consider their options to help in the investigation or take advantage of the SEC Whistleblower program.
