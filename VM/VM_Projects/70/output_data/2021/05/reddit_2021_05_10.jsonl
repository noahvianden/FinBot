Whether or not you believe the bubble exists, doesn't mean it doesn't. OP should not find any solace in this comment; I would hope he is still as clueless as the rest of us. One thing I would say, is that whatever has happened over the past 5+ years, we are staring down the barrel of runaway inflation. Continued inflation would see the market continue to rise. Ideally, the fed would like to curtail inflation but the only way to do so is by raising rates. The fed cannot raise rates due to the amount of unaffordable debt this would create for themselves. Therefore, inflation keeps on running hot. Until the day they do raise rates, I can't see a significant crash. Maybe some blips and recoveries but nothing like a true market crash can come until they raise rates. I for one am long gold and uranium watching this thing heat up, ready to jump ship once it crashes. The good thing about gold is I have time to exit my position and not watch it crash 40% in a day. The good thing about uranium is that the structural deficit in the market leads me to believe it will largely unaffected by other market forces until we see that $60 uranium spot price.", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "\"runaway inflation\".
