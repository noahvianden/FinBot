{"title": "Expected moves this week. SPY, HD, TGT, AMAT, TSLA, RIOT", "selftext": "**The Broader Markets**\n\nLast Week \u2013 SPY was down by about 4% at one point during the week but closed the week lower by only about 1.5% vs the 1% move options were pricing. The VIX closed at 18.80, but was high as 28 during the week\n\n**This Week \u2013 SPY** options are pricing a **1.5%** move (in either direction) for the upcoming week. That corresponds to about **$411** as a *bearish consensus* and **$423** as a *bullish consensus*.\n\n**Expected Moves for This Week** (via Options AI)\n\n* SPY **1.5%**\n* QQQ **1.9%**\n* IWM **2.5%**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**In the News**\n\nCryptos... Here's a look at Coinbase, Riot Blockhcain and Marathon Digital expected moves\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ttf54gxojoz61.png?width=628&format=png&auto=webp&s=c84ded3bdf4bbadec2915e918be204638340f67f\n\nThe merging of the crypto and stock headlines (via Elon) feels like a thing that's been building up for a while. I'll be fascinated to see how it plays out. TSLA stock has benefitted more than any other big cap stock by merging those two audiences. But now that Elon is picking sides in crypto one would think it changes the dynamic of his cult. (I don't mean literal cult, but it's certainly a cult stock)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Earnings This Week**\n\nEarnings season continues with reports from box store retailers Walmart, Target and Home Depot, China stocks Baidu and JD as well as tech names Cisco and Applied Materials.
