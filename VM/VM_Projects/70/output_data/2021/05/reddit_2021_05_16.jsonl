{"title": "Weekend IV Report - Stocks with high IV and more expensive premiums", "selftext": "What's up fellas at Theta Gang. I made a tool called [FD Ranker](https://www.swaggystocks.com/dashboard/stocklabs/fd-ranker) that logs the average IV of some popular stocks.\n\n**What is this tool good for**\n\nI often use the theta gang wheel strategy by selling cash secured puts close to at-the-money and I like to see where I can get some bang for my buck. A quick scan of the list will tell me what IV is looking like for certain stocks and when earnings is coming up and whether or not I want to do a weekly theta YOLO for earnings. You can sort by IV, stock price, or Earnings and filter by ticker.\n\nHere's some of the top tickers from this weekend. Instead of making a full list of tickers ranked by IV, I'll share some of the more common tickers mentioned.\n\n# High IV Tickers List\n\n\\*Some of the market cap and earnings date data is off, so always double check before entering any plays!\n\n|Ticker|Market Cap|Stock Price|IV (%)|Next Earnings Date|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|AMC -
