{"title": "Stocks Crashing DD - Due to Final Tax Week", "selftext": "It's the last week before taxes are due. 2020 was a substantial bull market where huge gains were made, and many new users in platforms like Robinhood made money off of short term trades without realizing the tax repercussions. The current price of Tesla is a clear example of that. I personally owed 40% tax on my gains from last year and had to sell a substantial portion of my stock portfolio due to this.\n\nMost Robinhood users I've talked to don't understand that you're taxed on the gain from each trade rather than your overall gains for last year. On top of that, you can only write-off $3k of losses.\n\nIf you look at the stock market crash of 2000, similar activity drove a crash.\n\nMay 18th will be the day to buy most stocks. May 17th is the last day taxes are due.\n\nFinally if you're investing short term and buying and selling dips, make sure to appropriately factor taxes.", "id": "nb8c3b", "created_utc": 1620879920.0, "score": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.51, "num_comments": 77, "comments": [{"body": "Taxes are paid on overall net yearly capital gains income, not on individual sells.
