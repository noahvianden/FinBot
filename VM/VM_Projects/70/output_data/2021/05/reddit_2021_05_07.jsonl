{"title": "CD Project and the CyberDunk 2020 - and the rebound", "selftext": "Put your bananas aside, I have something for your handful of brain cells.\n\nLet's quickly recap the Cyberdunk 2077 release:\n\n* Awesome teaser trailer 8 years ago.\n* Insane hype train accelerating over the years:\n   * I mean just look at videos like this from 2019: [WhatAPromoVidSoCoolDisGame](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2KozvzdKr4)\n   * Keanu Reeves\n* Stock hits $128\n* Release postponed to December\n* Stock drops to $88, rises again to $119\n* Release:\n   * Bugs bugs bugs\n   * Bad graphics on old consoles\n   * Big shitstorm\n* Stock dips and dips and dips and dips\u2026 Now around $42\n\n**Ok just sounds like they totally botched it. But did they?**\n\n1. Bugs everywhere..  \nDoes anyone remember the Witcher 3 release though? It was also pretty buggy. Ok, maybe not AS much. But still, CD Project has a history of releasing buggy games and fixing the issues later on. Witcher 3 is now one if not the most iconic RPG games. Search [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/36ewbt/official_bug_thread/?sort=confidence), browse [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpAGtIdANK4) or whatever to get an impression of the bugs.  \nFor Cyberpunk they have [plans for fixing and free DLCs already released](https://en.cdprojektred.com/news/cyberpunk-2077-our-commitment-to-quality/). Given their history, I trust CD Project to fix the game and make it one of the best.\n2. [13.7 mio. copies sold in 2020](https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2021/04/management-board-report-on-the-activities-of-the-cd-projekt-group-and-cdc-projekt-sa-in-2020.pdf) (65)  \nThis is the number of copies sold in 20 days. To put this into some relation, CD Project sold [20 mio. of Witcher 1, 2 and 3 together](https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2016/03/FY_2015_results_presentation.pdf) (4) in the whole year of 2015, the release year of Witcher 3 (which was released in may, so 8 months of selling).  \nAlso worth mentioning: [Only with the pre-orders](https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2020/12/current-report-no-652020.pdf)  of digital distribution channels (\\~8 mio.) CD Project covered all  development cost of Cyberpunk 2077 as well as all marketing and  promotional cost until the end of 2020. So the revenue on more than 5  mio. is solely going into the pockets.  \nSo overall some damn good  numbers. And there is still potential. Consider that some degenerates  like myself didn't buy the game yet but probably will, when most bugs  are fixed.  \nCD Project also wants to massively extend the Cyberpunk universe.\n3. The refunding campaign  \nFollowing up to the disastrous release, CD Project started a refund campaign for Cyberpunk 2077.  \nI couldn't find the number in official documents, but [some sources](https://www.ign.com/articles/cdpr-issued-some-30000-refunds-for-cyberpunk-2077) say 30 000 copies were refunded.  \nThis is 0.2% of the sold copies!! Doesn't look like a bad game to me. I wouldn't be worried if the refund numbers would exceed 1% or more, and even that is so far from where we are. Sounds a lot for shitstorm and media cryout. \n4. The hack  \n[CD Project got hacked](https://twitter.com/CDPROJEKTRED/status/1359048125403590660)! And the attackers stole the source code from Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk!  \nOk, cool down. Pick up your banana again. CD Project gives a shit about  copy protection. None of their games have any, because they believe that  people who love the games will pay for them. Their Backups weren't compromised. So again just negative media coverage.\n5. The Witcher  \nIs not suddenly gone. The games sell and there is more in the pipeline. A  next gen version of Witcher 3 and an AR mobile game (hunting monsters in  the real world instead of throwing Pokeballs at them) are announced  this year.  \nYou probably also watched the Netflix series in your  basement, missing some action of your wife and her boyfriend upstairs.  It was the most successful series on Netflix until then. CD Project has  all rights on Witcher. So guess what's gonna happen when the second  series is released in August.\n6. The financials  \nI don't want to overload your brain cells. Just let me tell you the company is rock solid. Liabilities could be paid right away. Net margin of >30% since 2015.  \nIf you think you can handle more numbers, check the [report](https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2021/04/consolidated-financial-statement-of-the-cd-projekt-group-for-2020.pdf).\n7. Conclusion  \nIt seems to me that the sky high anticipation paired with the disappointment was the best food for the media, journalists, click baiters and everyone who could profit from a dramatic coverage. And boy they did. If it was such a  bad game, more people would have used the refund campaign, so it was probably trashtalked it into oblivion.  \nThat's why the numbers speak a different language. Cyberpunk seems to be a success and the Witcher was always gonna continue.  \nSo looking at the whole picture, what has happened, what is going on and what is coming, I can only see this stock going upward.\n8. Positions  \nHolding 30 @ $87.08, 30 @ 74.49, and now bought another 30 @ $47.27\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n* Cyberpunk was financially a huge success, despite the bad media coverage.\n* The Witcher will fuel the rockets with a Witcher 3 overhaul, a mobile AR game release and the second season on Netflix.\n* Solid financials.\n* Ticker is OTGLF\n* \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nIf you find anything about the short interest, that would be something interesting to look at, too.
