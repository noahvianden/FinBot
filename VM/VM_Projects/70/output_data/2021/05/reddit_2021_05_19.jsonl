Now you may not believe aliens are real and that\u2019s fine that you\u2019re that ignorant. We don\u2019t judge. However, the US has been conducting recon missions observing these aerial phenomenons. They know they exist. They know they are here. They do not know their intentions or capabilities. Which is scary to think. \n\nSo how does this relate to stonks? How do you deal with a possible threat that has way better technology than you?
