I find it incredibly annoying and sheepish. \n\nThese are my picks, that I've researched obsessively and believe will result in substantial wealth building over time.\n\n# SUPER HIGH CONVICTION\n\nThese are companies that I believe have unmatched economic consequences and their existence fundamentally challenges their competitors to improve.\n\n1.PINTEREST (Search) **- The Idea Search Engine**\n\n2.
