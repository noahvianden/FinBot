{"title": "PUBM DD #1", "selftext": " \n\nA little bit about myself for context:\n\n1. I work in enterprise mergers and acquisitions.\n2. I've been an armature securities analyst for about 6-7 years now.\n3. I'm careful about where I put my money. Pubmatic is a compelling investment, so lets get into it.\n\nWhat is Pubmatic?\n\n* Pubmatic was founded in 2006 and operates in programmatic digital advertising market. They are generally considered an old school adtech company by much of the adtech community. In a nutshell, their platform-as-a-service provides tools to help connect publishers to advertisers so that they can sell ads. Pubmatic is known as an \"SSP\" or supply-side-platform. Supply being ad inventory on a publisher's website. Advertisers looking to purchase ad inventory will work with their own demand-side-platform or \"DSP\" and the whole transaction happens automatically. This has advantages over simply calling up a publisher and purchasing the ads in person. Namely speed and data analytics that these platforms have. Keep in mind that I am no expert in adtech whatsoever. Here is a high level info graphic:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/555339dhob071.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=42585b1cfe4cf1c85eab62b0cc01791f5321f1e2\n\n* I would encourage you to look into this further, as it is quite interesting and fun to learn about.\n\nThe SSP Market:\n\n* Unlike the DSP side of the equation, the SSP market is highly saturated and commoditized. I've found dozens and dozens of SSP competitors and they generally sell the same ad inventory. Publishers often times will work with many different SSPs to sell their inventory in an effort to capture as much revenue as possible. This has led to the saturation of the market and you see publishers sometimes working with 10-20 SSPs at a time. So how does an SSP compete?\n\nThe competition:\n\n* There are a few different ways SSPs can compete with one another. Technology and scale are the two that come to mind. If an SSP has sophisticated analytics or advanced features, it's an easier sell to publishers. Additionally, if an SSP can operate at a large scale, they can get a higher percentage of the ad dollars flowing to the publishers, and can provide better fees. Pubmatic is the 3rd largest SSP behind Google and Magnite\\* (**fact check needed**).\n* The biggest players in this market are Google, Facebook, and Amazon. These are obviously some heavy hitters and they control a majority of the internet. They are often called \"walled gardens.\" Think about youtube ads for example. Google simply sells their own youtube ads using their own adtech installations, no need for Pubmatic. They can also buy ads from themselves and put Google ads on youtube. So they play both sides of the market. It is extraordinarily difficult to compete with them since they are basically the government of the internet and control a mind-blowing amount of personal data on each and every one of us. However, the \"open internet\" is still very much alive and growing, and this is where Pubmatic competes.\n\nHistory lesson section: I'll need to do some more research on the history of the programmatic ad market and I'll post it in the next DD. Historical context is important to the story. Basically though, the digital advertising market is constantly going through dramatic shifts. If you look back, Pubmatic has grown resilient based on the fact that they've needed to reinvent their products a few times over. Some examples are the rise of header bidding, and most recently the sunset of the 3rd party cookie in Chrome. This is why Pubmatic doesn't hold any debt. Their revenue stream is sensitive to market shifts.\n\nPubmatic's Moat:\n\n1. I don't have much insight into the competitive advantages of Pubmatic over other SSPs, but I can definitely say that there is some kind of moat.  \n\n   1. First:  \n\n      1. Pubmatic's net dollar based retention rate is 130%, up from 121% last year. That tells me that for one reason or another, more ad dollars are flowing through their platform. This is probably due to the SPO deals that they've been cutting, or \"supply path optimization.\" These deals cut out a number of the existing SSPs that a publisher works with, and drives up market share for Pubmatic. They've been making these deals for a while now and it's a big growth driver. Smaller SSPs are going to suffer, but Pubmatic is big and a beneficiary of this phenomenon.\n   2. Second:  \n\n      1. Management describes their competitive advantage as being an \"infrastructure first\" company. This is unique - they own their own infrastructure rather than operating on something like AWS. I'll get into their financials later, but I like this part of their business. Magnite and many other SSPs operate on AWS, so they're giving a portion of their revenue to Amazon, who also competes with them. So you can see how that's a problem. Also, by owning their own infrastructure, Pubmatic can engineer their way to better outcomes for the publishers and advertisers. They are still working on this, but theoretically, they could offer lower prices and faster speeds. They aren't there yet, however. Take a look at their cost per ad impression:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kffnxp4gob071.png?width=961&format=png&auto=webp&s=db940e67eaabd3471afac9b2d50c7765744964ed\n\nA nice downtrend on the costs. This is the benefit of the infrastructure first approach.\n\nAnd yes, the T on the left is TRILLION. They deliver trillions and trillions of ad impressions every month.\n\n1. One final note on the moat: creating a moat in the SSP market is notoriously difficult, but somehow Pubmatic seems to have found one. I would love to hear more from someone experienced in this space to help me understand better. A lot of the adtech community describes Pubmatic as \"generic\" or \"not interesting,\" but the numbers tell a much different story. Lets get into that next.\n\nPubmatic product and revenue mix - This will be in the next post.\n\n1. High level:  \n\n   1. Mostly mobile ad sales\n   2. omnichannel - meaning they can sell inventory across multiple channels (desktop, CTV, mobile, etc)\n   3. One note about CTV  \n\n      1. Linear TV (boomer style cable television) is going by the way side in favor of connected tv, or CTV. CTV is compelling because there are no walled gardens controlling the market, so it is all up for grabs. Competition is quickly heating up between the likes of Disney, Roku, Fubo, Magnite (through Spotx M&A), and others. Pubmatic has a CTV implementation, but they were late to the party. That said, they already have the necessary tech to compete in CTV, so now it's just a matter of selling it. They'll need to work harder though to steal market share from competitors.\n\nFinancial condition:\n\n1. This is the part that gets *very* interesting. Pubmatic's financial condition is really something special:  \n\n   1. 18.5% GAAP net profit margin for 2020\n   2. 32% EBITDA margin\n   3. Zero debt\n   4. 73% Gross profit margin\n   5. 7+ years of positive free cash flow\n\nThese type of numbers clearly say that there is something here. Nothing about these numbers is \"generic.\" If Magnite's products are so much better and if Magnite is a \"market leader\", why are they losing market share and not growing organically? Why are their margins worse even though they have a larger scale? Why haven't they been able to achieve high profitability? Seems to me that Pubmatic isn't so \"generic\" after all. But again, **I am not an expert in adtech**, so please please fill me in if you know more.\n\nRevenue and margins have been increasing nicely over the last 3 years, even with the COVID headwinds. Management has indicated a long term revenue growth rate of 20%. I'll make another post later with a more detailed financial analysis and valuation (hint: it's higher than 1.6 billion).\n\nI want to stress how unusual it is for a growth stock IPO to have such a high level of profitability. Often times with IPOs, the company has to go out and prove that they can make it, or that they can grow into profitability. Pubmatic is already in a more mature state and path the higher risk phase of posting losses (Magnite is still 1-2 years away from profitability, that makes it more speculative)\n\n\"The next Trade Desk\" - I've heard this before. Bottom line: the SSP and DSP markets are different. There is no \"next trade desk\" The trade desk is leading the charge against the walled gardens, and no SSP will take that place simply because they aren't right in front of the advertisers. Advertisers pay for the internet, not publishers. That said, Pubmatic has high profit margins and growth rates, very similar to TTD.\n\nShort interest:\n\n1. Most people seem to be the most interested in this part, which is understandable. I find the above more compelling myself, but lets get into it :)  \n\n   1. Public float:  \n\n      1. \\~7 million shares\n      2. Yes you heard that right, just 7 million shares are available for purchase. It's not a mistake.\n   2. Institutional ownership  \n\n      1. North of 90%\n      2. This is what makes the public float so small\n   3. Short percentage  \n\n      1. North of 50%\n      2. This is not a mistake, it really is that high\n      3. What's more, it seems like there is **just one fund shorting this stock**. Northern Lights Trust Fund II (**fact check needed**, I looked into their SEC filings, but I couldn't find where the short sales were shown)\n   4. Speculation time:  \n\n      1. **Tin foil hat activated**: Magnite is the primary competitor to Pubmatic. By almost every measure, Pubmatic is a better company. Wouldn't it make sense to coordinate with a fund to drive down the price of Pubmatic? If they didn't short to such a high degree, my guess is that Pubmatic would have an equal or higher market cap than Magnite even with less revenue. That would be very embarrassing for Magnite, so they need Pubmatic's price to struggle. And why not? With such a low float and low volume, it wouldn't be hard for a short seller to be in control of the price. I have half a mind to message management and find out what they plan to do about this. Why would a short seller short Pubmatic to such an intense degree? How could a smaller company (pubmatic) with better profitability, better margins, and better organic growth rates trade at a LOWER multiple than Magnite? Is SpotX really that good? What if the Disney contract falls through? Magnite is a good company, but I see red flags all over. Doesn't make much sense. **Tin foil hat deactivated**\n\nRisks:\n\n1. The adtech industry is constantly shifting and management will need to be nimble enough to roll with the changes or some other company is going to eat their lunch.  \n\n   1. Rebuttal:  \n\n      1. Pubmatic operates with a high level of efficiency and doesn't hold any debt. Their engineering team in India is crazy efficient. I have worked with similar teams in the past.\n      2. Again, Pubmatic has been growing their revenue and profit margins for a long time. I think they understand that it is important to maintain a certain level of nimbleness.\n2. The oligopolistic internet super powers (I.e. Google) figure out a way to crush them  \n\n   1. Rebuttal  \n\n      1. This is a risk, but they haven't been successful in crushing Pubmatic so far. In order to do this, these walled gardens would need to own the whole advertising market on the internet. This is a very low risk. The open internet isn't going anywhere.\n3. Ad dollars drying up  \n\n   1. Pubmatic is totally and completely at the mercy of advertisers spending money on their platform. If they stopped spending due to some unforeseen issue (global economic meltdown), they lose reveune  \n\n      1. Rebuttal:\n      2. We saw a huge drop off in ad dollars in Q2 2020 during the initial stages of the pandemic. Nevertheless, Pubmatic grew their revenue, so they've shown they can still compete even with this type of headwind.\n4. Transparency  \n\n   1. This is a weak point for Pubmatic. Transparency is becoming a hot ticket item. Advertisers are becoming more and more sensitive to where their ads get placed. For example: a family theme park isn't going to want their ads displayed on a porn site because it can damage their brand. They also want to defend against ad fraud, or when a bot clicks on an ad but obviously doesn't buy anything. Why would an advertiser want to pay good money for an ad if a bot is going to click it?  \n\n      1. Rebuttal:\n      2. Pubmatic needs to work on this. They have a fraud program that is available on all of their products, where they provide a refund if fraud is detected. So that is good, but I think they can do more. Pubmatic is incentivized to sell as many ads as possible, even to bots. I'm not sure what else they could do, but I think this could be a good selling point. I know that they've been giving more visibility into the data to publishers and advertisers, so that is good. Again, I think they could do more on this. That said, they aren't having any trouble selling their products, so maybe this isn't too big of an issue. At the very least, management mentions it all the time so they are aware of the concerns from advertisers.\n\nThat's it for now. **Please feel free to poke holes in the DD so far**.
