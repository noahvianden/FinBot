Assuming that AP and FSD are completely separate software projects, does it make sense to put much effort into AP? Yeah, it would be great to keep radar in the vehicles until FSD is ready, but Tesla probably run the numbers through a calculator and figured out that it's cheaper to put their learnings from FSD into the standard AP and save few hundred bucks on the radar, especially if parts shortage stopped deliveries (then the actual costs of getting radar into the cars is much greater).\n\nAlso, the FSD being delayed only proves how hard of a task it is.
