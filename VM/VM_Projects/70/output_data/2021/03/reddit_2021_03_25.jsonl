{"title": "UWMC Follow Through - The Mad Money Interview, Mortgage Servicing Rights, and Bank to Be Made Today :)", "selftext": "So here was my initial DD. [https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m9frpz/enough\\_with\\_the\\_techno\\_mumbo\\_jumbo\\_a/](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m9frpz/enough_with_the_techno_mumbo_jumbo_a/)\n\nAnd here was my YOLO:  [Follow Through on my UWMC DD : wallstreetbets (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mcdlwg/follow_through_on_my_uwmc_dd/) \n\nI obviously wished to give a status update after the Jim Cramer interview yesterday night, and talk about the rapid price decline (Everything opened down), since it went to 7.73.\n\nSo, first of all. The Jim Cramer interview. I liked that the CEO\n\n* Seemed hungry. Aggressive (in a good way). He's a competitor. He's fierce. He wants to be #1, and he wants to make money hand over fist. \n* Re-affirmed guidance even with rising interest rates and with his ultimatum(This is a material statement, so I'm not inclined to believe he's lying) My memory is slightly foggy. But I actually think he said that they were going to have even better quarters ahead. \n* He stated that out of 12,000 Brokers, not even 500, chose to partner with Quickens. This is a -bit- misleading, as only around 4000-4500 were sending business to both. Regardless, it's a wonderful figure.\n* Stated that Rocket is mostly Refi's (93% is the figure he gave), whereas UWM thrives on home purchases. He's stated they do BETTER in a high interest rate scenario (especially compared to other mortgage brokers). \n\nOverall, there were other points, but their hazy and I will need to re-watch the interview. However, this is not just regurgitation, or I wouldn't post this. I want to talk about Mortgage Servicing Rights as an asset, which the CEO has been accumulating more and more of. \n\nDefinition: Mortgage Servicing Rights are the rights to collect monthly payments, allocate principal and interest to each payment, manage insurance fees, and managing property tax payments. A mortgage lender may outsource the tasks to a third party in exchange for a fee (Aforementioned mortgage servicing rights). The payments must still be sent back to the original mortgage lender, of course, but without the fee negotiated. \n\nHedge Against Inflation: Mortgage servicing rights represents a significant revenue source for many independent mortgage banking companies, and community banks. Given the dynamic interest rate environments, mortgage servicing rights create a natural hedge or protection on the supply side of the mortgage lending business. When interest rates rise, there are fewer prepayments, and the value  of mortgage servicing rights increases. However, when interest rates are low, the prepayment speed increases, and the value of mortgage servicing rights decrease. Ishbia had been, and is still accumulating, mortgage servicing rights. The value of which will rise as interest rates increase. This is one of many reasons why he's poised to do well in a rising rate environment, especially relative to peers. \n\nI do not think these mortgage servicing rights have soured, as the majority, if not almost all, of the purchases of homes recently have been by white collar buyers wo have not been affected by Covid and have seen their Net Worth increase due to the pandemic. \n\n\\-----\n\nHomebuilding and Furnishing strength:\n\nI'd also like to look at homebuilders, and furniture makers as KH popped. based off earnings, and yet another homebuilder did well on earnings. (Can't remember the name, as I was watching CNBC for an hour prior to Jim Cramer's interview) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Buy, Buy, Buy. Strong fundamentals. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSources:\n\n [Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSR) - Overview, Example, Importance (corporatefinanceinstitute.com)](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/trading-investing/mortgage-servicing-rights-msr/) \n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/24/uwm-ceo-says-fight-with-quicken-loans-is-paying-off.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/24/uwm-ceo-says-fight-with-quicken-loans-is-paying-off.html)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI ended up buying a tiny amount of extra shares at around 7.97. Unfortunately, I was busy on the phone at 7.73 talking about the stock, as well as determining how to move around some capital I had to take advantage of this, and didn't realize i still had 95 shares of GE lying about and i knew the market would correct on the stock quickly since the market is a rational force over a longer period of time. By the time i realized it had already went back up to 8.11 :(. Regardless, I've bought more shares. My cost basis has been lowered, and i expect when I'm approved to sell covered calls on my Merril Account, I'll purchase even more shares.

I don't think it's necessarily a bad call option, even if that premium you bought in was pretty high. To break even, you need a 25 percent raise in the price of the stock. However delta is .51, (Though Gamma is trash at .09). If it raised a dollar, you'd be roughly even. Especially with Theta being low. \n\nYou've given yourself over 5 months to get it to that price point. So, you need an average of 5% returns per month to break even. Summer is typically the best quarter for mortgage companies.\n\nWith that said, UWM reports earnings on May 5th. 7.5 May 21 is the call option I have. Current premium is roughly the same as what your August ones are worth (1.30).  However, delta is .61 and Gamma is %14.1 while Theta is .008% per day. (A feature of being ITM). The breakeven price is therefore $8.81 for a roughly 7.8 percent breakeven, or a 3.9 percent monthly return to break even at the option expiry. Furthermore, exercise assignment is better since you're getting it at that sweet sweet threshold. \n\nHell even buying August 7.5 calls are better as you're buying at 9.35 breakeven, but delta is higher at .658 per dollar, and gamma is roughly the same. \n\nMay 21 7.5, or August 20 7.5's would be prices i'd be okay exercising at which is why I recommend them. \n\nI would honestly roll your options into May 21 7.5 Options, or roll them to August 20 7.5 Options.
