Morgan Securities LLC, as representatives of the underwriters, agreed that **the restricted\nperiod will end with respect to 40% of the Shares subject to each lock-up agreement** (or 20% of the Shares if the stockholder is a member of the\nCompany\u2019s board of directors (excluding affiliated funds) or management team) and become eligible for sale in the public market at the opening of\ntrading on March 9, 2021 (subject to trading limitations on Shares held by affiliates of the Company, continued vesting of any unvested equity\nawards as of such date, and the Company\u2019s insider trading policy).\n\n\nSomewhere in between 90 days being March 9th, and requiring 3 additional days, and them announcing in lawyer speak that the lockup ends on March 9th, the truth exists. If you consider legally the \"Early Lock-Up Expiration Determination Date\" to be 3 days before you are allowed to sell, which is the wording here, then the lockup is 3 days after that day, therefor the 12th.\n\nPlease God correct me if I am wrong.\n\nPositions: 140p 3/12 lol.", "id": "m2hbbb", "created_utc": 1615435305.0, "score": 46, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 76, "comments": [{"body": "That's the  confirmation bias I need ( down 90% in my 3/19 put)", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "Down 40% on my 3/26 puts but averaged down by increasing my position 3x today.
