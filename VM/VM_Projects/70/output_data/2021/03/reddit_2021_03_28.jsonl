{"title": "I save my entire income and can't stop losing money", "selftext": "Sorry for my english, it's not my first language. Disclaimer: ECH = IPSA. It's an index, not a company.\n\nSo I'm a very disciplined person and since my first job back when I was 17 y/o i've been saving 100% of my income every single month. I'm a software engineer and since i'm still young, i'm still living with my parents and help the household with secondary sources of income such as freelance work and etcetera.\n\nThe thing is, it's been over 5 years and I'm still in the red. I always read that time in the market beats timing the markets, the story about the world's unluckiest investor in the SP500, but for some reason this doesn't apply to me. Back when I started it was kinda difficult to invest in foreign markets, so most of my portfolio is basically my country's index, $ECH (Chile IPSA index), which has done nothing but go down in the last 5 years from its $55USD high to the current $33.6 where it's sitting right now.\n\nA while ago i discovered a fintech that allows us chileans to invest in the US tech sector (a fund composed of ARKK, ARKW, Tesla, Apple and such), and since a lot of people said 2021 was the \"year of recovery\", I diversified with that... and 3 days later the treasury-yield crash came and that's now in the red too. The saddest thing is, not only did I start investing my monthly salary in the tech sector, but also a payment from a freelance job i had been working in since early 2020, so I lost a bunch of money with the recent crash because I didn't DCA. Now, the reason i didn't DCA is 1) i believed in analysts saying 2021 was the year of recovery and 2) i had a horrible experience with DCA'ing in ECH, as i \"buy the dip\" but it keeps getting lower and lower. It doesn't matter that i bought cheaper the next month: it just keeps going lower and lower.\n\nI honestly don't know why I have such bad luck. I can't withdraw my money even if i wanted to because of the losses (I don't want to do so anyways) and i would've been much better just spending everything instead in a car, a house or something.\n\nHow can I stop losing all of my income? Thanks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EDIT**: I'm adding some context on the chilean market below. I tried to be as concise as possible, I hope it's good enough.\n\nI started investing IPSA in late 2017. Back then (early 2017), the index was looking good because of high expectations in the new president (Sebastian Pi\u00f1era, a right-winging conservative) economic outlook, people thought Chile would skyrocket thanks to his administration.\n\n2018 came and chilean growth was mediocre at best. People started noticing Pi\u00f1era's better times (Tiempos Mejores) weren't a reality, as economy-oriented government reforms were hard to implement because of the left-wing politicans in the chamber of deputies blocking them.\n\nIt's 2019, the year of the commercial war between the US and China. China was the main economic partner of Chile, so the confrontation was very bad for the chilean economy. Some side effects of the trade war, according to analysts, include lower prices in commodities such as copper. There is a very high, known historical correlation between copper and the Chile IPSA index (you can read about it in [this](https://repositoriodigital.bcentral.cl/xmlui/bitstream/handle/20.500.12580/3612/BCCh-rec-v17n3dic2014p056-085.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y) paper, the point being it's been studied). So, low copper prices + trade war = $ECH goes down even more.\n\nOctober 2019 comes and the 30 peso revolution starts. Public protests were an alien thing for us chileans before October 2019, we had a very stable country with low to none social revolts in our recent history. This revolt started because of a subway (Metro) fare price hike 2 days prior. Protesters destroyed the subway, supermarkets, police stations, and so on and so forth, asking for a refundation and a new constitution that replaces the one written by Pinochet's regime 40 years ago. The IPSA crashes.\n\nLate 2019 comes and politicians from all sectors, left and right, conservatives and liberals, reach an agreement for a new constitution, one to be written by 155 electors chosen by popular vote in the same way as deputies. The IPSA goes up 8% in a single day because everything seems to be going good. The protests mostly stop and Chile finds its new peace. Investors are scared at first because of the potential dangers of a new constituion, but since we have a D'Hondt voting system, right-wing politicans are certain to reach the necessary threshold of representatives to keep the political stability that characterizes Chile as a country, especially when compared to its latin american neighbors. Investors stop fearing so much, and it's this point when i said to myself \"it's finally going to pay off. 2020 is going to be a great year for my portfolio!\"\n\nThen 2020 comes and the virus comes. The IPSA crashes to 2008 levels. At this point, it just makes me laugh how unlucky I can be. There is a small-percentage recovery right now from the absolutely low nonsense prices we had in 2020, especially because Chile is the second best country in vaccination speed after Israel, we're expected to reach herd immunity in June 2021 or earlier. Also copper is at all-time high prices, but we lost the copper-to-IPSA correlation after these recent events.\n\nThat's where Chile stands at, 2009 levels right now. In order to recover my losses, the IPSA would need to recover from: a commercial war, a social revolt, the dangers of a new constitution, the coronavirus, and the impact of low copper prices from years prior.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "mf6a9g", "created_utc": 1616954860.0, "score": 52, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 71, "comments": [{"body": "Hang in there.

An outdoor test can't be expected to be the perfect temperature every time; hence they document it and allow the reader to make with it what they will.\n\nAs to factors that mitigate temperature differences.  I think he made an interesting point with vehicle voltage and higher Taycan testing temperature.  A higher voltage system will reduce heat loss and reduce the need for cooling in the electrical system.  Alistair could have also mentioned the heat pump system that the 2021 model 3, Taycan, and e-tron have, that would reduce the amount of energy used to heat/cool the powertrain and cabin at lower/higher temperatures.\n\nAfter getting into a bit of a debate with Rob on his video... it seems a bigger issue for him is his feelings about the buffer not being counted in the official Edmunds range results.   That would really come down to personal opinion.\n\nI personally think it's important for Edmunds to point out what range customers should expect in real world driving situations, and relying on buffer range under 0 miles is nonsense.  Under 0 miles, the customer has no idea how close to the end of the battery they are, and for Tesla, that range varies making the situation even harder to deal with.\n\nTesla may provide that buffer range, but they don't expect it to be used.  Other companies don't give drivers the option, they give a bit of buffer, but make most of it inaccessible.  Their EPA estimates are based mostly around range to 0 miles, and even without the buffer, they're exceeding their EPA range figures in real world driving.  Available buffer is just cherries on top in case of an emergency.\n\nHonestly...

The full charging curve is what matters.\n\n>and how many times do you think they sold this lie in the dealerships so get out of here.\n\nI guess zero!  LUL.  How about you tell me, did you hear any reports of Porsche dealerships lying about the charge rate, or are you just talking out of your backside again?\n\nAs to the 2021 statement about 350 kW; this is the first I'm hearing about it, but then I don't always remember every single quote from articles over 1.5 years old... I imagine you don't either and you just happened to stumble upon this quote while you did an internet search frantically looking for evidence to confirm your bias... failing miserably and then changing the argument to something entirely different.\n\nI haven't heard Porsche talking about 350 kW charging recently.  If they're still trying to hit this, then I imagine it has to do with them developing a silicone anode.  Whether they were successful or not... I guess we'll see in their upcoming vehicles.

Myself and another person have already told you that you're putting words in Porsche's mouth.  As you've just stated, any electric car's battery will degrade more the faster it charges.  Porsche hasn't restricted people from charging at 270 kW.  They've given owners the option to charge at a slower rate and to stop at a specified percentage, for multiple reasons as I noted in my last post.\n\nTesla doesn't allow people to restrict their charge speed to help protect the battery... So I guess I don't understand what your complaint here is...\n\nSpeaking of Tesla though as you believe they're so superior... you do mean the company that would limit a car's ability to supercharge at max speed, without the owner's permission, if the owner supercharged too often?  And this you find to be the superior solution?\n\n>And I'm comparing it to the model S, and once the plaid starts making its round (not even mention plaid+), and of you care about performance, nothing, literally nothing compares.\n\nAh yes... \"once the plaid\"... always \"once the plaid\".  It's been \"once the plaid\" for 1.5 years now.  I'm sure the plaid version will be very fast.  After all, they designed the car to be faster than the Taycan / Lucid.  Not exactly ground breaking stuff here.  Figure out how to make the powertrain faster, and make it faster.  Figure out how to improve aero and improve it.  I'm sure Tesla will have the fastest car in the shed, just as I'm sure other car companies will either decide to match it, beat it, or concentrate their efforts elsewhere because not every customer buying one of these cars only cares about 0-60 time.\n\nIs the model S refined versus other cars?  Eh...not so much.  I asked which categories.  You stated speed as if it's the only category... lol!   What about...\n\n* Body shape / characteristics\n* Fit and finish\n* Interior quality / materials / comfort\n* Suspension characteristics\n* Handling\n* The ability to get 4 wheel steering\n* The ability to get high quality carbon ceramic brakes, or any of the other superior Porsche braking solutions.\n* How about the driver's cluster\n* Seat comfort for both general driving and sporty driving?\n* Customizability\n* Paint colors\n* Wheel options\n* Interior / exterior trim modifications\n\nTesla's cars are certainly more plain jane....  As it turns out, Porsche isn't only known for speed, in fact a lot of their cars aren't always the fastest.  They're known for the details and how their cars handle.  Being detail oriented and getting the little details right, such as suspension feel, is expensive.  Unlike Tesla, Porsche doesn't rely on their customers to do their testing for them, and then only tweak after the customers point out issues.\n\nFurther, Porsche produces smaller volumes which retains more exclusivity, demanding higher prices.  Lower volume cars are always priced higher to pay for the R&D and the production.  I'm sure it's also more expensive for Porsche to do proper QC, unlike Tesla.  Probably because they don't cheap out and understaff their assembly lines.  QC done properly is expensive and adds to the cost of the vehicle... but you get a vehicle that was properly inspected and repaired before it gets to the customer.  It seems more and more, Tesla sends  the car to the customer, who then has to act as the QC department and point out flaws that Tesla needs to come back to fix, or that the customer has to waste time going to the service department to fix.\n\nTesla wants to pump out as many lower quality vehicles as it can and make it up on volume.  They will undercut competitor prices because all they care about is gaining market share while their losses are subsidized by governments and competing OEMs... now that's funked up.  Tesla doesn't care about the small details and adding character to their cars... they just care about the brute force specs, like 0-60 time, so they can claim to be be the best.  It wreaks of narcissism... just like Elon Musk's personality.\n\nLook, I'm sure the Plaid will be very fast.  It'll even drive very long distances.  Will it be as enjoyable to drive and own as a Taycan?  Doubtful.  Will it have the character / beauty of a Taycan?  Doubtful.  Will those with the means to buy either car want to buy the Tesla instead of the Taycan ?  Doubtful.\n\nI mean, don't take my word for it, watch some of the reviews.

Alistair stated multiple times the very reasonable explanation of why he won't do that... because customers should not be expected to drive past 0 miles to increase their range.\n\nIt seems Rob went into this interview with the agenda to frame Edmunds as a biased tester who is out to embarrass Tesla by testing Tesla vehicles in colder temperatures. Rob used biased graphics to attempt to do this.  If you're interested, I'll explain that below....\n\ntldr...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn Rob's first graphic, he showed the top 3 tested range vehicles as a way to show the temperature variance of the tests and how Teslas were tested at colder temps:\n\n* The model 3 tested in 53F. Lowest overall temperature tested\n* The model S tested in 60F.\n* The Taycan tested at 73F. Highest overall temperature tested.\n\nThe temperature gaps between the Teslas and the Taycan absolutely were huge, but not indicative of the majority of the tests as Rob is attempting to infer with this graphic.  When looking at the average overall temperature of all vehicles tested, 64F, the Model S was only 4 degrees below the average, with multiple other vehicles tested at or near the same temperature.  The 53F test was definitely an abnormality, but that doesn't prove testing bias.  It proves that Edmunds got access to test this new car during the winter on a 53F day in CA...\n\nWhat's more interesting in this specific graphic is what Rob didn't show. He didn't show the 4th vehicle or the 5th vehicle in that list, specifically cutting it at the top 3. The 4th was the Kona, tested at 61F that exceeded its EPA range by 21%. The 5th was the Mach-E, tested at 62F that exceeded its EPA range by 12%.  I imagine Rob didn't show these because they would have directly contradicted his narrative that Edmunds is using temperature to bias Tesla's results.   In doing so, he just destroyed any journalistic integrity he has.  What a blatant disregard for the data...\n\nThe other vehicles tested around that 60-63F temperature exceeded their EPA range by 7% - 36%. Rob never brought any attention to those in the conversation as they once again discredited his argument of Edmund's biased test parameters.   Other vehicles were tested in temperatures as cold as the Teslas (excepting the abnormal 53F test) , and those other vehicles exceeded their EPA range where Tesla failed to do so.\n\nAlistair's argument for this temperature disparity was completely fair... they can't always control when they get the vehicles to test. When they get them, they test them. Just like how Tesla Bjorn tests vehicles across the entire spectrum of temperatures.  It's also why Edmunds and Bjorn include the ambient temperature data for transparency.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the second graphic...\n\nRob went further to suggest that when you average all 6 of the Tesla test temperatures (61F) and compare that to the average of the other 11 vehicles tested (66F), the 6 Tesla tests were 5F colder.  Rob often does this grouping of Tesla-vs-everybody else to make his point.  Except he doesn't mention that one Tesla test was of the 2018 model 3 which isn't exactly applicable anymore, and the abnormal 53F Tesla test has a significant hand in pulling down the overall Tesla average in a small 6 vehicle sample set.\n\nRemove the 53F model 3 test and the 2018 test, and the average Tesla test temperatures rise to 63F.\n\nCurious, if the overall average temp is 64F, or 66F for all non-Teslas, then Is Edmunds being biased against Chevy, Ford, or BMW, with their average 60F/62F/62F average testing temperatures respectively?  \n\nOf course not!!!\n\nRob is looking at these tests through Tesla shaped glasses, only concentrating on the one brand he cares about, carefully pulling data points from the full picture to specifically drive his narrative.\n\nHow about the model Y that was tested at 65F, or the model 3 SR+ that was tested at 67F? Rob never explicitly mentions these as a counterpoint as they again disprove his narrative.  That's 2 of the 6 Tesla vehicles tested, and again, one of the other 4 is the 2018, and another is the abnormal 53F test...\n\n\\_\\_\\_\n\nAlistair was solid in all of his responses... He could have been more open to re-doing the 53F test again at a temperature closer to the average.

They didn\u2019t test at the same temps, they didn\u2019t test the same range, and then they splashed the internet with fake news such as \u201cTesla doesn\u2019t meet EPA range\u201d.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I think the buffer in a ev is probably something like 20%. If you drive to 25 % you are fine, to 20 you damage a just a bit, to 15 you damage more.. and likely to be a non-linear function. Even when you drive it until it stops, Tesla shouldn't be letting you get to absolute zero charge. It seems that below zero the speed is reduced and the car is really in damage control mode. The comparison with the buffer in a gas car needs to stop because it's really very different.\n\nThe buffer is an engineering trade-off. For Tesla to offer 8 years warranty om their battery and make longevity claims and keep up the resale value they rely on this buffer. It does not deserve a special treatment, it's economics. Rather than claiming more range, the pro-Tesla discussion should be\n \"Yes, real world range is less than EPA, but it will last longer, and keep that range over many years. How's your Leaf doing? Have you charged your Taycan at 800V much? Why do you have to park your Kona outside?\".\n\nIm quite happy about the Edmonds report. And they did the right thing by then testing the distance to a stop. Still their initial method has value and i am glad to have that info. Of course the second test gives a lot of important perspective on the issue and is important that they did it.

Again the main issue is the testing/headline, not whether people do this on a regular basis.\n\nIf Edmunds had said that Tesla had a lower \u201creal world\u201d range than EPA range then that would be accurate (and also expected by anyone who knows about EVs).

{"title": "Let\u2019s Talk About \u201cMarket Makers\u201d", "selftext": " \n\nLet\u2019s Talk About \u201cMarket Makers\u201d\n\nGetting Straight to the point.\n\nThere are 3 Licenses needed to be a variation of what most retail traders consider a \u201cMarket Maker\u201d.\n\nHowever each license does not make you a market maker.\n\nThere are three different types of license holders:\n\n\\-Designated Market Makers (DMMs),\n\n\\-Floor brokers\n\n\\-Supplemental liquidity providers (SLPs)\n\n1.) The DMMs, formerly known as \u201cspecialists,\u201d act as dealers in particular stocks. Typically, each stock on the NYSE is assigned to a single DMM. As a dealer, a DMM maintains a two-sided market, meaning that the DMM continually posts and updates bid and ask prices. Because of this, the DMM ensures there is always a buyer or seller available, promoting market liquidity.\n\n2.) The job of a floor broker is to execute trades for customers, with a LARGE emphasis on getting the best price possible. Floor brokers are generally employees of large brokerage firms. The interaction between floor brokers and DMMs is the key to this old-school, non-electronic trading on the NYSE.\n\n3.) Now the SLPs are essentially investment firms that agree to be active participants in stocks assigned to them. Their job is to regularly make a one-sided market (i.e., offering to either buy or sell). They trade purely for their own accounts (using their own money), so they do not represent customers. They are given a small rebate on their buys and sells, which encourages them to be more aggressive. The NYSE\u2019s goal is to generate as much liquidity as possible, which makes it easier for ordinary investors to quickly buy and sell at prevailing prices. Unlike DMMs and floor brokers, SLPs do not operate on the floor of the stock exchange.\n\nExample of DMM Role:\n\nOn the floor of the exchange are a number of stations. These stations have multiple counters with numerous terminal screens above and on the sides. These stations have multiple counters with numerous terminal screens above and on the sides. People operate behind and in front of the counters in relatively stationary positions.\n\nEach of the counters is a DMM\u2019s post DMMs normally operate in front of their posts to monitor and manage trading in the stocks assigned to them. Clerical employees working for the DMMs operate behind the counter. Moving from the many workstations lining the walls of the exchange out to the exchange floor and back again are swarms of floor brokers, receiving customer orders, walking out to DMMs\u2019 posts where the orders can be executed, and returning to confirm order executions and receive new customer orders.\n\nImportant: There are two key differences between the NYSE and NASDAQ: (1) NASDAQ is a computer network and has no physical location where trading takes place, and (2) NASDAQ has a multiple market maker system rather than a DMM system. Notice that there is no direct trading in the crowd as there may be on the NYSE.\n\nExample of DMM Role:\n\nYour clerk has just handed you an order to sell 2,000 shares of Walmart for a customer of the brokerage company that employs you. The customer wants to sell the stock at the best possible price as soon as possible. You immediately walk (running violates exchange rules) to the DMM\u2019s post where Walmart stock is traded. As you approach the DMM\u2019s post where Walmart is traded, you check the terminal screen for information on the current market price. The screen reveals that the last executed trade was at $25.63, and that the DMM is bidding $25.50 per share. You could immediately sell to the DMM at $25.50, but that would be too easy. nstead, as the customer\u2019s representative, you are obligated to get the best possible price. It is your job to \u201cwork\u201d the order, and your job depends on providing satisfactory order execution service. So, you look around for another broker who represents a customer who wants to buy Walmart stock. Luckily, you quickly find another broker at the DMM\u2019s post with an order to buy 2,000 shares. Noticing that the dealer is asking $25.76 per share, you both agree to execute your orders with each other at a price of $25.63. This price is halfway between the DMM\u2019s bid and ask prices, and it saves each of your customers $.13 \u00d7 2,000 = $260 as compared to dealing at the posted prices.\n\nFor a very actively traded stock, there may be many buyers and sellers around the DMM\u2019s post, and most of the trading will be done directly between brokers. This is called trading in the \u201ccrowd.\u201d In such cases, the DMM\u2019s responsibility is to maintain order and to make sure that all buyers and sellers receive a fair price. In other words, the DMM essentially functions as a referee. often, however, there will be no crowd at the DMM\u2019s post. Going back to our Walmart example, suppose you are unable to quickly find another broker with an order to buy 2,000 shares. Because you have an order to sell immediately, you may have no choice but to sell to the DMM at the bid price of $25.50. In this case, the need to execute an order quickly takes priority, and the DMM provides the liquidity necessary to allow immediate order execution.", "id": "mf8qv7", "created_utc": 1616961958.0, "score": 594, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 70, "comments": [{"body": "I hear the sound of thousands of wrinkles forming on brains across the globe", "score": 204, "replies": [{"body": "*It's as if a thousand wrinkly apes cried out all at once and decided to buy more GME...*", "score": 88, "replies": [{"body": "*punch it* **Chewy**\ud83d\ude80", "score": 7, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.13191592693328857}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.32679471373558044}, {"body": "Kiddo, i read one word n then went back to masterbaitin'", "score": 14, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.15059590339660645}, {"body": "it hurts, poppa!  give me some GME DD and make it stop!!!", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "Buy GMED, got it", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "I still watch that stonk and think about that user sometimes.
