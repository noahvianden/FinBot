{"title": "Defense and Aerospace stocks are undervalued and are a good opportunity for investment", "selftext": " Since the crash of 2020, many sectors have recovered and are trading at pre-pandemic levels (looking at you Tech). Defense and Aerospace is one of the few sectors that are still trading at a massive discount. Big names such as Raytheon Technologies (RTX), General Electric (GE), and Lockheed Martin (LMT) can be grabbed at a discount.\n\nMy favorite being Lockheed Martin.\n\nLockheed Martin has had a phenomenal decade with revenues and profits growing about an average of 9.5% YoY. its profit and operating margins are sitting at a healthy 10 and 13% respectively. With deep ties to the US government and a steady increase in military budgets (who represent 70% of sales) as well as any hint of potential conflicts directly benefit the company.  \nIts F35 program has had some issues and production delays due to covid but is looking like it is taking off. This will guarantee a further revenue stream for the next decade at least. Its missiles and fire control segment grew a whopping 51% since 2017 with its other sector such as Aeronautics and space segment at about 23% each. Furthermore, LMT is the prime contractor for NASA's Orion Spacecraft and is working actively with them on long-duration human deep space exploration.  \nLMT pays a solid dividend of about 3.1% at current prices that has been increasing steadily over the years and is likely to continue.\n\nOther options to capture the sector exist such as the DFEN ETF (though should be warned it is leverage, hence the very strong price drop) or the more general ITA ETF.\n\nDisclaimer. I own all 3 of the stocks mentioned. Picked up GE and Raytheon in December and recently took up Lockheed. They seem like great value and have provided steady returns and are one of the few sectors left that are still trading at undervalued prices. I believe the weak sectors are bound for a rebound due to the great rate of vaccine uptake that will subsequently lead to a new economic cycle starting. Companies that have a solid business as is in this case will profit even more.\n\nThank you for reading.\n\nMy other top picks include Exxon and BP (Oil and Gas, though they are no longer trading at the same discount but still have some room for growth with essential business and good dividends), Wells Fargo and JP Morgan (Banks and financial services), Kelloggs (undervalued consumer staples, which will benefit from a strong economic recovery) and Simon Property Group and WP Carey (solid dividend-paying REITs which are also undervalued).", "id": "lwsl5d", "created_utc": 1614773942.0, "score": 70, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 76, "comments": [{"body": "Personally if i had to.

The USA has 94 power reactors with an average age of 39 years, and Watts Bar 2 is the ONLY reactor completed since 1996.  France has 56 -- also mostly at end of their planned lifespan and with no real plan to build replacements (the only recent build at Flamanville went ruinously overbudget).  Some of their old reactor units will get license extensions, which buys another decade or two, but many will not.  Canada has another 19 reactors hitting end of life soon -- and for example they couldn't get a competitive bid for adding new units to the Darlington site.  \n\nNuclear power is not economical anymore, due to the high up-front cost and long history of ruinous cost overruns and delays in construction.  Regardless of other factors, nuclear energy is a dying industry in North America and Europe, and modest growth in China and India won't offset that. That is the reality on the ground.  \n\nYou can choose to ignore the facts and hope for something different if you like, but that's where we're at now.  SMRs won't be on the market at scale for at least 20 years (the first pilot project, UAMPS, isn't going online until around 2030).  There is no guarantee SMRs will deliver on their promises (I've watched 20 years of \"exciting new\" reactor designs that never reached the market).  \n\nUranium prices may go up short term due to insufficient mining, but long term the demand is headed downwards.\n\n> how do you phase out coal and natural gas plants without a reliable base load energy source\n\nA quick google will show you that there are a variety of options.
