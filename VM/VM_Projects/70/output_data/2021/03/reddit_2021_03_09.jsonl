Not only three competition still can't compare with the 2018 model 3 in all the metrics that truly matter, i can't wait to see their profit per EV sold. It can be much and it will get worse in the short term, not better. Tela has a bargaining chip (battery manufacturing that they will keep on improving) no other OEM will have this in the short term. This is the situation, originally you had Tesla as the only real mass consumer of these batteries so there was a balance between battery companies lowering costs and Tesla letting these companies compete to get the best prices, Tesla saw the problems that will be created out of the demand for batteries increasing at a much larger pace than the supply. So now imagine the biggest 10 car companies with the ability to ramp up mass production of vehicles way way way faster than you can get a new lithium mine up an running to get the chemistry necessary for the battery (just an example of one component) at this point, battery manufacturers have the advantage since there is low supply and high demand. The cost of batteries will go up short term and only the biggest car companies capable of ride this expensive wave will survive.
