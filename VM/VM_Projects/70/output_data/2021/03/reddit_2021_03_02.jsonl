They were no longer considering salespeople salaries to be operational costs but rather capital expense. Based on the premise that contracts acquired through the sales department were tangible assets. The cost of said contracts were to be amortized over 4 years. The contractual two year length plus an assumed second two-year re-newal. The army of sales people (at last count CRM has 56K employees). It is questionable how many employees salaries would be considered part of the cost to aquire contracts. Does this only apply to the principle sales person or is the expense of the whole department including secretaries and utility bills also included in contract acquisition costs? No doubt considering Salesforce primary expense is their army of salespeople This accounting change dramatically affected the bottom line. \n\nhttps://investor.salesforce.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2018/Salesforce-to-Adopt-New-Accounting-Standards/default.aspx\n\nSales people like executives at Salesforce are recruited and heavily incentivized with stock options. These options are considered an expense in general accepted accounting principles (GAAP) however if you choose to use non-gaap accounting expensive options and the subsequent solution of the stock does not go in the debit column. Apparently their value materializes out of thin air and doling them out to employees is never calculated in the bottom line.

If Salesforce did not use accounting gimmicks such as amortizing contract acquisition expenses, stock options compensation that are not merely bonuses but make up for a huge part of the compensation to the sales people, and repeated acquisitions, CRM would be losing money, lots of it every quarter. Their stock price would be going down, their options would be worthless, their salespeople would leave, and this whole house-of-cards would collapse.\n\nOn December 1st Salesforce announced the acquisition of Slack and the market reacted coldly. The stock price dropped from $260 to $220. Not a crisis There was plenty of time to bring the stock price back up, making options viable, compensating sales people... Indeed over the last 3 months during a choppy market the stock did climb to $250.  On February 26th, Salesforce announced a significant beat in revenue and a strong beat in earnings. That should have brought the stock back into an upward climb. However the rest of the years guidance was a few cents lower than analyst expected and the stock went down from $240 to under $220. \n\nI believe Salesforce is in quite a pickle.

I am offering my opinion that is based solely on my own internet research intuition and prognostication. I have tried to report all facts figures and quotes as correctly as possible, however I may have made an error in representation. All the information conveyed is accurate by intention.\n\nMillennials will have no recollection of WorldCom at least firsthand. It's a company that completely imploded in 2002. It was a very early spawn of telecom deregulation. A nascent player, it was born in 1983 on the eve of the AT&T break up. It grew through acquisition after acquisition to become a telecommunications giant. It acquired 65 telecommunications related companies in it s 19-year history. Culminating in the the monster acquisition (or at least attempt, the DOJ negated the deal) of MCI. The following is a good summation of the Worldcom fiasco analyzed in hindsight. \n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/08/business/for-worldcom-acquisitions-were-behind-its-rise-and-fall.html\n\nBernie Ebbers, The CEO and his cohorts understood what would propel their stock price. They merely needed revenue growth on a regular basis plus consistent profits. The profits did not need to be large just enough to hint that when WorldCom stopped It's growth phase and started focusing on profit it would be a cash cow. Acquiring companies that had good revenue and especially nice profits would bolster their bottom line regardless of price WorldCom paid. It was a Ponzi variant in the sense that as long as the company did larger and larger acquisitions the overspending on previous acquisitions would not come to light.\n\nIt is easy to grow your company if acquisition price is not a factor. And that's exactly what WorldCom realized. Each acquisition added to the bottom line of revenue. Each acquisition contributed to profits but in more ways than the simple additive of one company to another. Thanks to the highly subjective accounting principle of Goodwill, WorldCom was able to appropriate the value of a company to its name while disavowing much of its actual book value. Eventually that book value would reappear and be classified as newly created profit. Profit undeclared and saved for a later quarter to make up for a deficit, are sometimes referred to as 'cookie jar' profit. WorldCom regularly dipped into cookie jar to make sure they're quarterly estimates met or exceeded expectations.\n\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cookiejaraccounting.asp\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cookie_jar_accounting\n\nhttps://smallbusiness.chron.com/example-cookie-jar-accounting-35842.html\n\n\u201cGoodwill \u2026 represents the estimated\u00a0future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired that could not be\u00a0individually identified and separately recognized.\"  In practical terms Goodwill fills the gap between a company's book value and the price paid by its suitor.  A ridiculously convenient accounting principle that legitimizes any price paid for another company. \n\nhttps://www.accountingtoday.com/opinion/the-real-reason-to-amend-goodwill-accounting\n\nBernard Ebbers offered $30 billion dollars for MCI, an $11B premium over the next best offer from British Telecommunications. Clearly money was no object for Worldcom. MCI accepted. Worldcom had little concern about the actual value of MCI. It's sorely needed to continue to increase its revenue and profits. The plan like the dozens of acquisitions before was to inflate the Goodwill value and deflate the actual book value. Goodwill value can be amortized over many years whereas tangible assets are amortized over 4 years. More importantly, tangible assets can be brought back to fill gaps in future earnings.\n\nAs far as the cost of acquiring companies (or we should say inflated cost of acquiring companies), the companies are acquired through stock swaps. Yes, the acquiring company stock is diluted but the price does not fall as it appears they are getting equal value for the amount of share dilution. It's a wash. A company that is built on overpriced acquisitions in essence is a company valued on a tremendous amount of additive 'goodwill'. The Goodwill number is completely arbitrary to the price to company chooses to pay. There is a glaring work-around from accounting rules and the safety auditing is supposed to provide. Further, Wall Street might not even question the valuation as the company consistently shows increased revenue and profit. Even though a company that consistently beats earnings and has a slight profit quarter after quarter is a red flag for cookie jar accounting.\n\nWhen the department of Justice put a halt to the WorldCom acquisition of MCI, Ebbers and his buddies in desperation to continue the ruse resorted to full-blown fraud. The end of WorldCom was punctuated with misrepresentation of data traffic growth and shifts in expenses that were clear violations of accounting principles.\n\nNow let's look at the parallels to Salesforce.com. I'm not referring to both nsmes ending with COM. I'm sure that Jessica coincidence. Nor does it factor in that both have CEOs that are 6'4-6'5.\n\nSalesforce was started in 1999 and has acquired over 60 companies. Acquisitions have gotten larger and larger and much of the cost has been attributed to and accounted for as Goodwill. In 2012 analysts were already questioning if it was healthy that 25% of listed CRM assets were intangibles. This analyst makes a solid argument that the intangible goodwill has never translated into increased profits and yet Said Goodwill of many companies has still not  been written down to market value.\n\nhttps://www.valueplays.net/2012/07/26/when-will-salesforce-write-down-goodwill/\n\nSince then the percentage of its value in intangibles, mainly Goodwill, has dramativally increased. As of October 2020 sales forces intangible assets (30B) made up more than 50% of their reported total assets (59B).\n\nhttps://www.gurufocus.com/term/Intangibles/CRM/Intangible-Assets/Salesforcecom\n\n[https://www.stock-analysis-on.net/NYSE/Company/salesforcecom-inc/Analysis/Goodwill-and-Intangible-Assets](https://www.stock-analysis-on.net/NYSE/Company/salesforcecom-inc/Analysis/Goodwill-and-Intangible-Assets)\n\nDecember 1st was a banner day for Salesforce.com. They announced the acquisition of Slack Technologies (WORK) for 27.7B. It was also the same day that the CFO announced he was leaving the company (More about that later). This was a much higher price than anybody had predicted during the rumor period before the acquisition was official. It represented a 55% premium over the price of Slacks WRK stock. It was confirmed later there was no competitive bid. Note Slack has never made a profit and it's stock was significantly down after missing its own revenue forecast.\n\nMore bemusing, Marc Benioff, the CEO of Salesforce.com had announced that he was not going to make any more acquisitions just 3-months earlier in August. Salesforce had just come off its latest completion of the $15.7B acquisition of Tableau Software in August 2019.  He was now adamant it was a bad environment for mergers and acquisitions. The CEO said Salesforce was going to focus on growth. He then did a complete about face and way-overpaid for Slack Technologies. Is there such a thing as an impulse buy extremely above fair market value?\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/davidjeans/2020/11/30/salesforce-slack-acquisition-marc-benioff/\n\n The street did not welcome the announced acquisition CRM stock dropped from $264 on November 25th when the rumors were reported to $220 December 2nd the day after the official announcement.

They surpassed expectations on both earnings per share and revenue. Further they project 20% growth in revenues over the next year. Increasing from $21 billion to $25 billion in revenue. Paradoxically, the stock dropped 6%. Explanations on this negative reaction by Wall Street are scant. I would like to present my theory of why the Street was disappointed but much more importantly why the stock should not even be a fraction as high.\n\nSalesforce.com is a company that was started 22 years ago and went public in 2004. The Salesforce website provides the following history\n\nhttps://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/the-history-of-salesforce/?bc=OTH&amp\n\nLike many tech startups before and after Salesforce.com was not judged on earnings but rather it's market share and revenue. And boy did it grow. Salesforce acquired company after company, revenue consistently increased and eventually a profit appeared. Salesforce.com represented an exciting innovative even disruptive company. It was a pioneer in putting software in the cloud, refered to as a SaaS company.\n\nLike many game changing and disruptive companies that came before and after such as Amazon, Tesla... The early years showed no profit. However, in those instances once profit appeared even anemic it continued to grow. Wall Street patience comes with a price one that accumulates over years. Stockholders and analysts It's my time maybe okay with waiting years for even a small profit. Eventually they expect to see a big profit one that matches the share price and market cap. That's where Salesforce.com has disappointed. Like usual it beat quarterly earnings estimates as well as quarterly revenue estimates. However, The mistake was releasing guidance that continued to show a 1- 2% PE.\n\n\nhttps://www.investors.com/news/technology/salesforce-stock-crm-salesforce-earnings-q42020/\n\nFor full-year fiscal 2022, Salesforce projected earnings of $3.40 a share, below estimates of $3.46. Salesforce said it expects free cash flow growth in a range of 10% to 11%, missing analyst\u00a0 estimates of 17%.\n\n\nSalesforce told the street that they were expecting to generate 1.5% of profit based on revenue. Yes, it was partially a miss on analyst expectations but more so it was the disappointment that sells for will not have a breakout quarter for another year. This year in particular Wall Street is impatient. The market is universally recognized to be overbought. Those not predicting a full-blown market crash in 2022 generally see a correction coming. Holding a stock now is about taking advantage of the bull run in the market. The government is pouring trillions into the economy and nobody wants to sit on the sidelines while the market dramatically rises. Those stocks that are predicted to have parabolic increases are attractive and stocks that will continue inemic growth, with PE ratios of 70, not so much.\n\nThis is my explanation of how the market reacted to what appeared to be a good earnings report. \n\nStay tuned for part two, when I will lay out my argument for why Salesforce.com may go bust.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Holy shit.

{"title": "Bull markets rest on nothing but inflation", "selftext": "Okay Degenrates, today is my 1 year anniversary joining wsb. Wanted to some thoughts on the historical inflations I have been researching on. Storytime..\n\n**Last week re-cap**\n\nLast week we have seen market shitting it's bed and the main reason has been the rise in yields on the long end of the yield curve. For those of you who do not know what the yield curve means, it represents the interest rate you get when you hold a constant maturity treasury securitiy (U.S. bonds). \n\nAs an example if you hold a treasury security that pays you the face value of $1000 10 years from now, the price you pay would be discounted by 1.45% as per the 10 yr- rate today. You can see that as the rate increases, the price you pay for receiving $1000 decreases. This is the meaning for *\"Bond prices go down when rates go up* \" on WSJ.  \n\nWhen the yields went up last week, the prices of the bonds have come down which means that not many investors are interested to get into bonds in the coming economic environment. When do the bonds become less interesting ? well, when the value of $1000 you receive in the future is not much of a value compared to today. In short **investors are expecting that INFLATION is coming.** In an inflationary environment bonds are not valuable to hold, hence the drop in prices and the rise in yields. \n\n*what should be worried about inflation ? Well, our savior Lord JPoW commander of the printer has a target of 2% inflation and what happens when this target is breached ? The printer goes mute and we won't have our tendies because stonks will go down when it happens.*\n\nHistorically, rise in inflation has been marked by rise in the value of the stock market before the price inflation sets in. This has been the case in both the German Inflation (1914-1923) and the Great American Inflation in 1970's. \n\n**German Inflation (1914-1923)** \n\nGermans had to let their printer on to fund  world war 1 and also to pay for the reparations that have been levied on them after the first world war. The speed of the printer is so high that makes JPoW's eys wide open in shock. The currency depreciated from the time somone started ordering their food at at a restaurant and by the time they paid the bill.\n\nTaming inflation has been hard as unemployement soared, government spending decreased and taxes increased. So they just let the printer on. One must beware of being a creditor whenever the governement is a debtor which means that this is the time to load up on some loans or personal debt as the amount you will be paying in the future would be worth less. Everyone who held cash has been wiped out and people who had capital assets were saved.\n\n***At the height of the boom, stock prices soard 4 times in a span of 9 months while dividends went out of style.*** when the first upturn of price inflation showed up, the stock market crashed on Black Thursday even before any businesses had failed . We have seen a teaser of this last week when stocks across the sectors got crushed. Interestingly, stock prices fell by about 25% for over 6 months while prices of rest of the goods went up. **The inflation was so bad at the end that all the german currency till that point was not enough to buy a loaf of bread the next day**. At the end of it all Germans profited from inflation as their debt got erased. Similarly, when we see inflation in the US in the coming months/years the money that came out of the printer would be less valuable and inflation is a way for some of federal debt to get diluted.\n\n**Fx rate indicator**\n\nFx rate is usually a sensitive indicator of inflation but here multiple factors that are in play at the same time. Currently, USD being the reserve currency and the increase in treasury yields will enable the flow of funds from emerging markets and elsewhere to the safe haven strenghtening the USD.\n\n**American Inflation in the 1960's**\n\nThe story is the same here again. The printer went brrr to fund American wars in korea, vietnam and also the policies of the newly elected Kennedy administration with slogan \"get the country moving again\". Althought, the magnitude of monetary inflation is different the scale is same.  German Money supply increased by 25 times while American supply increased only 3.5 times. Accordingly, price inflation in weimer Germany went up 17 times while American inflation went up 2.5 times.\n\n*Similar to the outages we have seen with the stock brockers, the market back then has been temporarily halted due to huge volumes and turnover which was a result of immense speculation in the stock market.*\n\nOne of the disastrous policy of that era was a tax cut amid the already huge debt that the country had ( guess you can relate to one of the huge tax cuts we had recently). The country enjoyed a great prosperity from 1962-1968 and when the Fed finally sought to stop the inflation, guess what the stock market crashed. \n\nWhen the prices went up multiple times per year, the production workers in U.S numbering around 27 million saw their wages raise around 1.9% year. you might as well relate when this  ends, which part of the economic class have been the most impacted. The inflationary boom always excludes the most numerous class from any share in its spoils. So yes this is time we make tendies.\n\n**Why is there no inflation yet? Human behavior has been the same**\n\nIf you are thinking as the printer went brrr why don't I see a rise in prices of the goods I purchase in the market, then the answer is that there's an asset inflation that's going on and you might have to wait a while for the price inflaiton to show up. \n\nAnytime When the printer goes brr and the monetary inflation increases, prices will initially remain constant. Humans tend to save or either invest in assets/financial assets rather than spend it on their personal consumption. This is the reason we see the stock market at such high levels, rise in house prices, lumber prices, copper, steel and what not. Finally when the Fed realizes inflation is here and raises interest rates, stock market will go down and people will start spending that money elsewhere on real goods. That my friend welcomes you to the world of price inflation.\n\n**Tl;DR**\n\nInflation is buy-now-pay-later. Historically, inflation has been preceeded by stock market boom and asset price inflaiton. With trillions of dollars of stimulus floating around, inflation will be real. Stonks won't always go up and this is the time to make our tendies. \n\nBull markets rest on nothing but inflation.", "id": "lvvmt3", "created_utc": 1614666373.0, "score": 174, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 75, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 85, "replies": [{"body": "Buddy just read a instagram post about inflation and had to vent to reddit.

{"title": "The Truth about RKT...", "selftext": "This is not financial advice and neither do you have to listen to my opinion. I\u2019m just expressing myself...\n\nWith that being said, I honestly don\u2019t think that RKT is a shill tactic. RKT is probably a short squeeze separate to the GME and AMC squeezes. Is it distracting? it sure as hell is. Me personally, I think a squeeze is happening as we speak and so maybe it\u2019s worth investing in, maybe not.\n\nI personally do not have a position in RKT and I won\u2019t go into it because I have my cash invested into GME (as well as my other blue chips). I\u2019m still -45% (it was -82% but I continued to average down) but I very strongly believe that we are gonna see this squeeze come into play some time around 15th March - 19th March. This would be due to: the second GME hearing 17th leading to an increase in media attention, Quadruple Witching day (extreme volume trading) 19th, with GME Q4 reports coming around the 25th. If the squeeze is to happen, mostly likely it will happen around mid to end March. \n\nNow back to RKT, i think that with this volatility that I personally wouldn\u2019t sell my GME shares to free up capital to invest into RKT, why would I lock in losses and then further risk being a bag holder for the RKT squeeze because the moment to invest in would\u2019ve been 2 days ago before we saw the jump and chances are that the squeeze will be finished very soon. If you are going to invest into RKT then I suggest you deposit more cash into you account and use that instead. \n\nAt the end, it\u2019s your choice. I know we all love GME and AMC but we can\u2019t fool ourselves by calling RKT a shill. My only advice I wish you do take from this is to never get too emotional and never let seeing a stock rally make you feel greedy that you think you\u2019ll get lucky and ride that squeeze. There\u2019s no telling when it will end. But when it does it\u2019ll crash back to earth. On the other hand, GME is a squeeze entirely of its own class. One that we cannot comprehend just yet. If the squeeze happens, which I believe it will. It will be historic. One that will be on movies and taught in economics classes for the future generations.\n\nOf course you do not have to listen to me. I don\u2019t even know what I\u2019m saying. But, if we all keep holding our GME shares, then we will inevitably squeeze the greatest of all squeezes. HODL (and GL to all you RKT squeezers I guess, I hope you put some of that profit  into GME or put your losses back into GME and be ready for what I call the \u201cRocket Gamma Short Squeeze\u201d \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nEdit: I do feel very conflicted with this post I made, and I might take it down. Is it a way to directly distract us (I.e, their manipulating RKT stock upwards)?  No. but are they indirectly manipulating the stock (I.e, through all of the media coverage and bots sharing gains on WSB and stuff)? I very much think this can be the case. If you ever see an increase in posts where people are praising RKT and shaming GME then that\u2019s blatant manipulation... \nBut I just cannot stand seeing my fellow apes acting like GME cultists, we mustn\u2019t get too emotional and think everything has got to do with GME. I own some TILRAY stocks long term, and I also hold CCIV stocks long term and continue to dollar cost average down into profits. But when it comes to short term, I\u2019m solely focused on GME and AMC and I own far more GME than any other stock currently because I really believe in this movement, plus my brain would malfunction if I has to look at more than two shares at once\ud83d\ude05", "id": "lwf0md", "created_utc": 1614726152.0, "score": 39, "upvote_ratio": 0.63, "num_comments": 76, "comments": [{"body": "I own all three and I\u2019m prepared to let Jpow suck me dry", "score": 43, "replies": [{"body": "Jpow will be receiving the sucking", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Either way one of us getting fucked", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.19608931243419647}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3664795756340027}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.14387717843055725}, {"body": "For the love of god\n\nITS OK TO BE IN ALL OF THESE PLAYS AT ONCE PEOPLE.
