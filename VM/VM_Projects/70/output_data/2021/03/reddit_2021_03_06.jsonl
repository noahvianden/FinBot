{"title": "Which ETF should I choose for long term? (10-15+ years)", "selftext": "\nSo I have landed a solid job in my career and finally have money to invest in. I\u2019m going to be playing with stocks alittle, but I\u2019m also planning to build a solid nest egg out of a long term index-based fund. After tons of research, I\u2019ve narrowed down my top 3 to be (in order):\n\nVTI (Vanguard Total Market)\n\nIVV (iShares S&P 500)\n\nVOO (Vanguard S&P 500)\n\nMy main criteria were low expense ratios (these are all at 0.03%), stability, and longevity. I like VTI more than VOO because VOO wasn\u2019t started until 2010, so it\u2019s lifetime yield isn\u2019t a good comparison since it missed the 08-09 crash. VTI has slightly better gains than IVV over its lifetime, but IVV has had better short-term growth. IVV and VOO also had better dividend yields.\n\nMy brain is honestly fried going over all the numbers and I just want to know if it really matters all that much which of the three I choose. Is VTI a good investment over the other two? Is there a better long-term fund I haven\u2019t listed? Any advice is welcome, I\u2019m just trying to make the smart move.\n\nEdit: I\u2019ve gotten great advice so far, thank you very much, but people need to stop spamming Ark etfs. You clearly didn\u2019t read the low expense ratio part. No chance am I paying 0.75% for such a volatile etf. 0.10% is the highest I\u2019m willing to go.", "id": "lyu64n", "created_utc": 1615005624.0, "score": 52, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 69, "comments": [{"body": "Welcome to r/stocks!\n\nFor stock recommendations please see our portfolio sticky, sort by hot, it's the first sticky, or see [past portfolio stickies here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+%22Rate+My+Portfolio%22+-+r%2FStocks+Quarterly+Thread&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all)\n\nFor beginner advice, brokerage info, book recommendations, even advanced topics and more, please read our [Wiki here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index)\n\nIf you're wondering **why a stock moved** a certain way, check out [Finviz](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=spy) which aggregates the most news for almost every stock, but also see [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/), and even [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/).\n\nAlso include *some* [due diligence](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/duediligence.asp) to this post or it may be removed if it's low effort.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The value funds will have higher dividends, but the Growth funds will grow at higher values and generally more volatile.\n\nAlso, do not forget mid-caps. Look into the Russell 2000.

What I will say is sometime in your life there will be a recession, the market goes down, and you lose your job. Make sure you have a savings account/bonds that are liquid that you can access to stay afloat for awhile. This is emergency money, disaster money,and things you do not want to take a loss on when you need to access it.\n\nAnother layer of money I want bigger gains in, but I want the risk to be minimal. This is money I would access if I was jobless for a year or 2. I want gains larger than the bond markets, but I will take some losses when the market goes down. Just not deep losses.

All brokerage firms display 'Unrealized gains' fairly well, but not all show 'cumulative investment return.' I use Merrill Edge and they only show cumulative investment return easily with mutual funds. This measure shows me how much I gain I have through dividends being reinvested into the fund.\n\nI mention this, because many people starting out go for high growth and easily forget about the effects of dividends. I have one mutual fund, as an example, that has 78% unrealized gains. It has 190% cumulative investment returns that to dividend investments and their gains.\n\nBecause ETFs trade like stock, their web-browser based platform doesn't show this.

I\u2019m young (20s) and think being more than 30% in a stock like VT is very foolish for me. That being said, I have a lot in QQQM, QQQJ, and then spaced out my remaining 33% into ARKs (F/G/K and soon X), SMH for semiconductors, cloud storage, EV/batteries, e-gaming/gambling, alt energy (ICLN and URNM), marijuana, and some foreign exposure through FDNI and FLKR. I realize this is very tech heavy, but I\u2019m okay with that amount of risk today and imagine in 20-30 years I will thank myself for being a bit more risky at this time. Really that was more of a \u201cinitial investment\u201d for me though and I plan to switch to more safe ETFs with time where I drop most of those speculative industries and just focus on like VTI (40%), QQQM/QQQJ (25% each), and then a dash of FLKR and ARKF, but this will be reevaluated too once I get closer to that age. If I was in my 50s, I\u2019d probably just dump 66% into VT/VTI and the rest split in QQQJ/QQQM. \n\nI guess I should note that this is how I treat my CMA where I am hoping to \u201cearly retire\u201d on it and then retire retire on my Roth IRA and 401K. My investments in those are much less speculative and are more like 66/16/16 spread of VTI/QQQs.

{"title": "Is it really worth staying in stock market as an average non-significant retail trader when the stock market is heavily manipulated?", "selftext": "I was reading [this article today from Morningstar where it compares today's stock market with that of 1990s](https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1028016/4-ways-todays-stock-market-resembles-that-of-the-late-1990s). \n\nThis confirmed the skepticism I have always had with stock market. In the 90s too, small long term investors like me gained very little over the decade, as whatever rises the share prices had made, were usually wiped out by one crisis after another.\n\nIn fact, I, myself have seen only a gain of less than 15% in last 16 months. Since I entered the market first time in December 2019, the market has seen a deep crash, which I was totally unprepared for and then whatever recovery and gain I made has all been almost wiped out in the past couple of weeks. And all this, despite investing very carefully and diligently, analyzing so many parameters using the tools available in many websites like Morningstar, [Etf.com](https://Etf.com), finviz.com etc.\n\nRecent events (GME for example) also suggest that stock market is actually a game between rich big investors or hedge funds. The market is heavily manipulated by them, whenever they like, while we, the tiny insignificant investors are just pawns to them.\n\nHence it makes me think if it's really worth being in the stock market. Investing and risking all your hard earned money, going through all the emotional roller-coaster, only to be manipulated by others and see so little gains.\n\nHence, I'd like to ask experienced ordinary retail traders of /r/stocks, Did these thoughts and observations never come to your mind? What's your perspective on this skepticism I'm going through?", "id": "lz0gjz", "created_utc": 1615033156.0, "score": 20, "upvote_ratio": 0.62, "num_comments": 70, "comments": [{"body": "YES. But here\u2019s the kicker: don\u2019t try to BEAT the market by investing in only individual stocks. Put most of your money in funds that track the market and then set aside a small amount for playing with individual stocks if you want. Look at a graph of the S&P 500 or Dow Jones the last 50 years. It doesn\u2019t matter how much it\u2019s manipulated year by year, the market goes up tremendously over time. It always has, even factoring in scary market crashes. Google \u201ccompound interest calculator\u201d and play around with it. If you put 600 a month into a fund that tracks the market and assume it will return a measly 7% a year, due to compounding and the rising market over time, you will have a million dollars in 35 years even though if you do the math you\u2019ve only put 250k in the market. If you put way more than $600 a month into the market you\u2019ll likely be a multimillionaire by retirement. A person who takes that 660 a month a throws it all at risky stocks or puts it under the mattress (or a bank account that gets like 0.0001 interest) will have way less money than you in the end.

In active investment managers make errors all the time, but not the same ones, so their errors cancel each other out. However index funds buy the same stocks at the same time and sell them at the same time too, which amplifies their movement and makes the market fragile. \n\nAnd actually \"risky growth stocks\" are featured in the SnP 500 now, so buy buying index funds, you are investing in Tesla or Facebook for instance.\n\nI am just saying that now it is the common wisdom that index funds overperform every single investment, but I have some aversion to common wisdoms.
