{"title": "NVIDIA - $NVDA is a great long term investment", "selftext": "I bought NVDA today, adding to a position I\u2019d initiated in 2018 and have continuously added to on most dips. \n\n**The Bull Case**\n\n* A great long term investment as demand for GPU\u2019s will remain high for the next decade\n* User markets such as data center, gaming and auto continue to grow\n* Leader in its market segments \u2013 best in class products\n* Gaming - Huge pricing power because of innovative, high quality product improvements such as ray tracing\n* Strong competitive advantage with its CUDA software stack\n* Mellanox acquisition also gives it a serious competitive advantage in Data Center\n* 15% Rev and 20% earnings growth expected per year in the next 5 years.\n* The ARM deal, if it goes through will be a huge shot in the arm for NVDA as a strategic near monopoly in licensing \n* NVDA has bought a majority of ARM with its own stock at $485 per share. The equity dilution is only 7%.\n\n**The Bear Case**\n\n* Stretched valuation at 40X Jan -22 earnings and 20X Jan-22 sales \n* Data center GPU users such as Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet are investing heavily to build their own chips. \n* Crypto revenue is not sustainable \n* Post covid environment may reduce gaming and therefore GPU demand\n\n**Challenges**\n\nThe ARM deal may not go through\n\nThe chances of several governments, especially the U.K and China passing the deal are low.  Several ARM customers have raised concerns about Nvidia likely misusing/abusing its position as the default licensor, forcing customers to use  its own chips.\n\nWith these concerns there will be heightened governmental and regulatory scrutiny into NVDA.\n\nThere are two interesting articles on the ARM deal. [Here\u2019s the one from Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bethkindig/2021/03/11/why-the-nvidia-arm-acquisition-should-be-approved/?sh=44c39eac45b2)\u2013  the author is hopeful that the deal goes through and why. She believes that governments like the US will push through to gain and maintain its competitive advantage in A.I.\n\nThe second is from Trading Places Research and called Nvidia and ARM: All About Control. It\u2019s from Seeking Alpha and why the ARM acquisition makes sense for NVIDIA. Here\u2019s the gist in the author\u2019s own words.\n\n>\u201cBut in the end, NVIDIA is trying to do what Apple does regularly, and is so very successful with: control the core technologies behind its products. NVIDIA wants to build a data center behemoth built around the CPU-GPU-DPU-AI stack. They control three of the four layers, and the Arm acquisition would give them the fourth, and most important layer in the stack. They can build this Goliath licensing Arm technology, but they would be dependent on someone else\u2019s roadmap. That someone else is mostly in the business of selling smartphone SoC IP, and is most interested in the future of IoT.  \n>  \n>But again, this is precisely what is going to scare Arm\u2019s customers so much. The entire smartphone ecosystem is dependent on the continued development of those cores, and if the company is shifting its attention to the data center, the rest may languish down the road. Those customers may even start looking at RISC-V. They have at least 18 months to mull it over, which is a lifetime in tech.\u201d\n\n**Valuation**\n\nSure, the stock's expensive at 530, but 3 years out NVDA earns about $24 a share, getting the PE down to 22, which is not bad for a 20% grower. \n\nSources: Wall Street Journal, Seeking Alpha, Forbes, Motley Fool.", "id": "m7qyyy", "created_utc": 1616074634.0, "score": 112, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 76, "comments": [{"body": "The problem is if you didn't invest in NVDA before 2018 there are much better options out there, at least for the short-term.\n\nIf you want to go long, why not something like MSFT?", "score": 35, "replies": [{"body": "Buy both!  $NVDA and $MSFT are excellent investments.

For a long time, NVDA was about 5% of my portfolio (I prefer to hold about 20 high conviction, long-term companies in my portfolio at any given time) but recently, NVDA as a position has now fallen to more like 2-3% of my portfolio. I would therefore also like to add more (at least double my position), but I am apprehensive about the valuation (the obvious time to add would have been in March 2020, duh...).\n\nAnyway, I do believe that Nvidia can eventually easily get to $100B+ in annual revenues. I work in a \"niche\" field that's not quite cloud, HPC or gaming but has similar technology requirements and I foresee a version of the future where the ARM-based Nvidia DPUs dominate the generic backend compute that is still dominated by x86 today (Intel and AMD). This is also the reason why I am not nearly as bullish on AMD as I am on Nvidia. Also as a side note, we use Mellanox NICs and they are a great company/team and a technology leader in what they do (I prefer their NICs over e.g. Solarflare).\n\nTo summarize, I am starting to think that I might have been wrong about the valuation with Nvidia and indeed missed some good buying opportunities during the last 6-8 months when it was available for below $500 (even after the post March 2020 recovery). Just to explain myself better, I do consider myself a value investor and typically the earnings multiple is one of the first things I look at. A lot (but not all) of my other 5% holdings are more classic \"value\".\n\nAnd just to clarify something, the thing is, from a purely quantitative POV,  40x forward earnings is not insanity... at 20% annual earnings growth, price-to-earnings multiples up to 40 (or even 50) can be acceptable (see \"Security Analysis\" by Graham et al). It's all about what the risk is with respect to the company being able to maintain its current earnings growth trajectory.\n\nThe $300B EV might be another thing that understandably turns people off, but obviously at some point Nvidia can start accelerating stock buybacks.\n\nFWIW, I am not adding yet at these levels, but I am seriously thinking about it.\n\nP.S. One thing about Nvidia is that it's not a SW company so it doesn't have SW company margins or ROC/ROA. However, part of its moat is the barrier of entry and uniqueness in the competitive space. Like you said, a risk is that the IaaS companies / cloud providers will use their profits to design and build their own chips (in that scenario, ARM is still a major winner though).", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks,\n\nI agree with your point re DPU's, and the PE's.

The other two are STX and WDC. With STX and WDC, you also need to look past the current yield and earnings multiple (especially with WDC as it is also in part a turnaround situation). For our company, data has become \"hazardous waste\" and we spend a huge amount of money each year on HDD storage. In many cases, tape is not a possibility and flash (SSDs) are too expensive, so HDDs are ideal for that. Not to mention what's happening with YouTube, security cameras, self-driving cars, etc. Just recently, some analysts have finally figured out that due to cloud storage requirements, HDDs are here to stay and then some (\"mass capacity, enterprise-grade drives account for 62% of revenues, twice the level of five years ago, as public cloud \"hyperscalers\" store more data on Seagate and Western Digital drives.

I was probably the age of the average reddit user trading today when it happened. FYI it was much harder to get into trading (and expensive) back then... make sure to appreciate the time you are living in! \n\nWhat I remember was that when the fed stepped in and started handing out money everyone was dropping the word \"hyperinflation.\" It was the first time I had heard of it and I had to figure out what it meant.\n\nThey also cut interest rates in half and the theme was \"it is only a matter of time before they came back.\" I bought a house in 2011 and my loan officer was pushing me to hurry before interest rates went higher. \n\nThey started this \"quantitative easing\" for the stock market where the government dumped money in so it would move up \"artificially.\" This is how it was explained to me at the time and why people started talking about the bubble building that was going to \"pop\" in the stock market as it recovered to it's \"pre-crisis\" levels. \n\nWhen I think back to the \"sentiment\" of the financial crisis I see a lot of the same things today but it is all compressed into a much shorter time frame now.
