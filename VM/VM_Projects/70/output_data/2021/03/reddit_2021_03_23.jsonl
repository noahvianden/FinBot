For anyone who wants to know more about Aphria's history, I suggest you guys read those posts first because I won't repeat earlier points I've made.\n\n# Introduction\n\nOkay retards, I lied. I said my previous post would be my last before merger, but with recent developments I could not help but make another post. My last post was also pretty badly timed for anyone looking to hold until merger, price was around $23.7 then. The price did go up to about $32 in the next few days so you could have also made a huge profit if you sold on the way up. But I advised you guys to hold until merger so I might have involuntarily created some bagholders with my last post, for which I'm sorry. To those who are holding through losses, don't despair. Aphria has a bright future ahead with the Tilray merger now in its final stage. That's what I'll be talking about in this post, so anyone interested please read.\n\n# Merger finalizing: arbitrage opportunity largely vanished\n\nFor anyone who doesn't know, on April 14th Aphria will host a shareholder meeting where they'll vote on the merger and on April 16th Tilray will do the same for their shareholders. This was announced about a week ago. Both companies cooperated in making a website for their shareholders on [www.aphriatilraytogether.com](https://www.aphriatilraytogether.com) with all the information you could possibly need. I especially recommend the Investors and FAQ sections. I know you guys are lazy fucks so I will summarize the most important info in bullet points:\n\n* **On April 14th Aphria will host a shareholder meeting at 4 pm EST on** [**www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/APHA2021**](https://www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/APHA2021)**. However, only registered shareholders can ask questions and vote on the merger. We can attend as guests if we fill out an online form.** Only shareholders with a significant position are registered. Most of us retail traders hold shares through an intermediary (brokers) so we can't vote unless the intermediary gives us notice. \n* **Both boards are unanimously in favor of the merger and are encouraging shareholders to vote FOR the merger.** Major shareholders will follow the board's advice. So sit back and relax, this merger thing will go through.\n* **Each holder of Aphria shares will receive 0.8381 of a Tilray Share for each Aphria Share. There will be no fractional Tilray shares.** I'll clarify this with a numerical example. I have 30 shares of Aphria, so I should receive 0.8381\\*30 = 25.14 Tilray shares. But there are no fractional shares, so I round down to the nearest whole number: I will receive 25 Tilray shares on merger date. The transaction should go through without any additional costs or taxes.\n* **Often mergers go through about a month after shareholders voted on it. Following this logic,**   \n**a potential merger date should be sometime in the middle of May.** I should say that this is not all at confirmed by either Aphria and Tilray, but it is just based on common practice. The exact merger date will probably be announced a week beforehand.\n\nIn my previous posts I always underlined that there was a small chance that the merger doesn't go through or that the merger split would be changed. Those two chances have both become 0% since the announcement of the meetings and creation of that website. This is why the arbitrage opportunity that I also highlighted in my last two posts has largely disappeared. \n\nCurrently Aphria is noted at $18.53 and Tilray at $23.56, which makes the split 0.7865 so the difference to the merger split has almost disappeared at a 0.0516 margin. This is probably due to big players on the stock market noticing and closing the gap. You can still buy in right now with a small benefit, but it's no longer a big lucrative play. Anyone still looking to buy in should just do it for the merger and the positive future of the cannabis market globally.\n\n**TLDR:** Last week Aphria and Tilray confirmed their merger with upcoming shareholder meetings and an informative website ([AphriaTilrayTogether](https://www.aphriatilraytogether.com)). Voting on the merger is finalized after the meetings on April 14th and 16th. Shareholders will surely vote in favor of the merger, so the potential merger date should be somewhere in the middle of May (not confirmed). Arbitrage opportunity is now almost fully gone.\n\n**Position:** Nothing changed, my 30 shares @ $8.74 are still standing strong.", "id": "mbest8", "created_utc": 1616506344.0, "score": 158, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 77, "comments": [{"body": "You did all that DD for a stock you have 30 shares of?
