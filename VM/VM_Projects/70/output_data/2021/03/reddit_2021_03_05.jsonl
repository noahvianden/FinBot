This is an enormous overreaction for a company that has reported the highest efficacy to date against the original COVID variant (95.6%) and has several billions of dollars in advanced purchase agreements for 2021. If trading at close to 1X price/sales (anticipated) isn\u2019t enough, NVAX is also the most well positioned vaccine maker to capitalize on the future booster market due to the ability to combine multiple strains in one shot and their excellent safety profile. NVAX is an incredible deal right now at $155/share.*** \n\n\\----------------------------------------\n\nRefer to my previous posts for more background and a more thorough explanation of NVAX\u2019s vaccine, particularly my last post on 1/28.\n\n \n\n**Recap of how we got here**\n\n* On January 28th NVAX reported best in class interim results from their Phase 3 UK trial (95.6% efficacy against original COVID variant) which led to shares massively increasing over the following couple of weeks, peaking at over $300/share. See summary figure from RA Capital below outlining NVAX's vaccine performance against the competition.\n* Since then, several advanced purchased agreements have been confirmed/finalized, and NVAX has secured orders for \\~200M doses, which CEO has indicated will be \\~$20/dose:\n* Additionally, NVAX has confirmed agreements for \\~1.4B doses that will be supplied through exclusive license agreements with Japan, South Korea, and India/COVAX.\n* NVAX completed enrollment for US/Mexico Phase 3 trial on February 22nd and will likely report interim results in March. \n* Earnings on March 1st provided several important updates around manufacturing and development of a new bi-valent COVID vaccine, however the market reacted negatively likely due to expectations around an update for the UK phase 3 trial completion and US EUA.\n* Shares continued to slide over the last 2 days due to broader market conditions closing at $155/share today\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/utbuipynd5l61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=e410d13bcb3bbc2a18b50edd2e616da2fbc423e2\n\n \n\n**NVAX remains well positioned despite being behind PFE, MRNA, and JNJ**\n\nBased on several comments I\u2019ve seen over the past few days, it seems that many people are not aware that there is a massive market for COVID vaccines outside of the US and that NVAX already has an agreement with the US to provide 110M doses. Yes, the US is vaccinating millions of people every week, but we\u2019ve known for months that NVAX was going to be approved after PFE/MRNA/JNJ and nothing has changed on that front. For the first wave of vaccinations, the US market was never going to be the major revenue generator for NVAX. It was always going to be about the ex-US market for 2021/2022. \n\nAs of today, NVAX has advanced purchase agreements with the following countries that will likely pay top tier pricing, which CEO suggested earlier this week will be \\~$20/dose:\n\n* Canada: 52M doses w/ option for additional 24M doses\n* UK: 60M doses\n* Australia: 51M doses w/ option for additional 10M doses\n* New Zealand: 11M doses\n* Switzerland: 6M doses\n\nThis does not include ongoing negotiations with the EU, which have been [reported](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-eu-novavax/eu-close-to-vaccine-supply-deal-with-novavax-sources-idUSKBN2AB10H) to involve supplying 100M doses with an option for another 100M. There will almost certainly be several more countries that come forward with purchases in the coming weeks. \n\nDuring the earnings call on Monday, CEO confirmed that all 8 manufacturing sites are making GMP product, with US and SK performing final fill. This is an important update and it appears that manufacturing will be able to deliver on projected supply of \\~160M doses/month once all sites are fully operational in mid-2021.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**New COVID variants (P.1 & B.1.429) can escape prior immunity to original COVID variants and vaccination with 1st-generation COVID vaccines**\n\nSeveral lines of evidence make it clear that at least two of the COVID variants in circulation are capable of immune escape. This is a big deal because it means that existing vaccines will be less effective (as we\u2019ve already seen) and will need to be updated in the future. It also isn\u2019t hard to imagine that in another 6-12 months, after more of the population has been vaccinated, that selection pressure will generate additional escape mutants that we'll need to think about. \n\nUltimately, this means that we\u2019re very likely going to need updated COVID vaccines with some level of frequency. NVAX and MRNA are already working on bi-valent formulations that will cover at least two variants and there\u2019s very good reason to think there will be more updates in the next few years. Due to the nature of their vaccine platform, NVAX is best positioned to take advantage of updated booster shots in the future. I went through this in more detail in my last post, but to summarize:\n\n* NVAX\u2019s high potency allows them to use a very low dose of protein (5\u00b5g) in their current formulation and they tested up to 25\u00b5g during phase 1 trials with no change in side effects. As a result, they have the \u201cspace\u201d to add coverage against several additional variants and have confirmed that they\u2019re already working on this. \n* PFE/MRNA have much less \u201cspace\u201d to add coverage against additional variants due to dose limiting toxicity as they\u2019re already relatively close to the ceiling of how much mRNA can be delivered in a dose without causing unacceptable levels of toxicity. Safety issues are already a concern with the existing formulation, particularly for MRNA, which was the subject of a recent New England Journal of Medicine paper ([NEJM paper](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2102131?query=featured_home)). Consequently, MRNA\u2019s bi-valent booster is being developed to cover two variants at half of the original dose to keep the total mRNA at 100\u00b5g. Still, safety remains a concern since we see an increase in side effects going from dose 1 to dose 2 due to an unknown mechanism and there are concerns that there will be a similar issue going from dose 2 to dose 3.\n* JNJ and AZN\u2019s platform use adenoviral vector platform to deliver the DNA sequence encoding the antigen. Both suffer from the same problem which is that the immune system recognizes the vector and impairs the efficacy of subsequent vaccinations\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNVAX will be able to leverage their best in class platform against new variants and will be able to take advantage of an expedited pathway to get updated formulations approved in the future based on recent FDA guidance ([link](https://www.fda.gov/media/142749/download)). As a result, future trials will be able to take place much faster, and the speed advantage for mRNA-based platforms will be significantly negated compared to the first round of trials. NVAX is undervalued at $155/share even before considering how massive the revenues for boosters could be. \n\n \n\n**NVAX is insanely cheap at an $11.8B market cap**\n\nI haven\u2019t performed any financial modeling so I\u2019m not going to give a price target beyond saying it\u2019s much higher than $155. Instead, I\u2019ll point you to the only four analysts who\u2019ve provided updated price targets since earnings on March 1st:\n\n* Eric Joseph (JP Morgan): $285/share\n* Kelechi Chikere (Jefferies): $310/share\n* Charles Duncan (Cantor Fitzgerald): $338/share\n* Mayank Mamtani (B. Riley): $397/share\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uf6n0kase5l61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ebff987688510434686220372b41902a08646e2\n\n \n\nFor comparison, two other COVID vaccine makers CVAC and BNTX have market caps of $15.2B and $22.9B, respectively. CVAC has no approved products and a COVID vaccine that appears significantly less effective and is at an earlier phase of development. BNTX is the inventor of PFE\u2019s vaccine and shares revenue with PFE. Yes, both CVAC and BNTX are getting a premium for their pipelines, but NVAX has a pipeline as well, with a Flu vaccine that successfully completed phase 3 prior to the pandemic and an RSV vaccine in clinical development, both of which are candidates to be made into combination vaccines with their COVID vaccine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n \n\n**Positions**\n\nShares\n\n3/19 $200, $220, $240 (bought on the way down; might be a little aggressive right now)\n\n4/16 $250, $300, $350 (a few of these were spreads that I closed the short leg on today during the selloff; spreads are a good option for NVAX bc of the high premium)\n\n7/16 $250/$400 call spreads\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis won't be in the 150s much longer.

It's early, but what we're seeing with the Brazilian variant suggests that escape variants are a big deal. We can talk about in vitro NAb and T cell data, but the bottom line is that we're seeing reinfection on a relatively large scale much sooner than most thought we would. \n\nHowever, after enough exposures (i.e. 4 or 5), I think it's very likely that people with healthy immune systems, and particularly those who can generate a competent T cell response will end up with mild disease upon reinfection with new escape mutants. With enough exposures, you'll end up with a sufficient level cross protection, especially from your T cells, that healthy people will probably be able to shake off an infection without much of a problem, even in the absence of updated vaccinations. \n\nAt first glance, that might seem contradictory to my bullish outlook for boosters, but it's not for a few reasons:\n\n1. High-risk groups (i.e. elderly and immunocompromised) will remain very important to vaccinate due to poorly functional immune systems, particularly with respect to minimal/absent T cell memory responses. I would assume that vaccination/booster rates will remain high in that subset of the population for the foreseeable future. \n2. Although vaccination rates will very likely be lower among lower risk populations, there will still be a strong incentive to be vaccinated with updated boosters to avoid infecting higher risk groups. \n3. I think the booster market will look much different than the first wave of vaccinations, since the premium placed on speed of development that favors mRNA platforms will be greatly diminished. Instead, factors like tolerability/efficacy will much more important and I think that favors NVAX greatly. mRNA vaccines are not pleasant and there are legitimate concerns around the reactogenicity of subsequent booster shots.\n\nI'm back up to an irresponsible percentage of my portfolio in NVAX bc of these factors.

{"title": "If You're Freaking Out, You May Be Too Invested", "selftext": "Before I begin, I want to stress that nothing, ABSOLUTELY NOTHING, is more important than your mental health, and if the market is impeding that, it might be -- and likely is -- time to step aside and focus on your health.\n\nThat said, March has been a metaphorical blood bath, there's no denying it. The pain and frustration that comes with watching your portfolio shrink, and your money disappear is a sobering kick in the ass -- especially for doe-eyed investors just starting out. But this is the reality of investing. Stocks go up, and stocks go down. If you've invested more than you can afford to lose, days like these are going to be hell. I empathize with you, as we've all been there at one point or another. Ego is the arch-nemesis of success, especially when a bull market turns. And our mistakes will always come back to collect.\n\nThat said, March has served as an incredible learning opportunity. If you're freaking out this month, you're probably too invested, or your research was underdeveloped. To that I say, consider reevaluating your process, tinkering with it, figuring out ways to help you manage months like these. Because its not the first, and certainly will not be the last. Play with risk tolerance, accept that mitigating risk might mean settling for smaller gains. Or that high risk speculation, mean just that. HIGH RISK.\n\nPullbacks, when played right, and analyzed correctly, tend to breed better investors. These losses, theoretical or otherwise, are the tuition we pay to learn. I hope that all of you come out on the right side of this month, and that you've learned something in the process.

{"title": "Purple Rated 10/10 strong buy, even after they touched me in my special places. DD inside", "selftext": "Alright- I lubed up and now I am ready to provide my insight into the purple call. First of all, the analysts still love purple.  46% average estimated upside, with the top analyst indicating 70%+ upside. Price movement today is very bullish, since the overall markets are tanking. I believe we will make a quick recovery into the mid to 30's. It might be a minute before we see the 40's, nonetheless I'm still bullish on the company, even though it took my anal flower. Purple was down nearly 15% before the earnings call and it dropped another 33% on the day of the call.\n\n# I HAVE NOT REDUCED MY POSITION\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[tip ranks](https://preview.redd.it/m00nmsbtl8l61.png?width=1294&format=png&auto=webp&s=62ddeb4808a16069df74bdb50dde3c62284fdf89)\n\n# Highlights from the call\n\n* purple is adding 20-25 stores company owned showroom - Previous calls indicated 3-5M in sales expected for the year, per store. This will setup 2022 nicely. 2020 ended with 13 show rooms owned by purple.\n   * &#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lgwcy947v8l61.png?width=608&format=png&auto=webp&s=14106809abe8d4bb9b20bae7997fa4fb5060a8c0\n\n* Guidance was close to my expectation\n   * 840-880M vs my 875M anticipated.\n* Purple is expanding into 1500 more retail stores\n   * &#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dl7v4hr0v8l61.png?width=609&format=png&auto=webp&s=03a5b9ddfde93c7112351557c76f7e99792af570\n\n* Purple's 2nd factory opened in the last week.\n* Purple is still capacity constrained overall and the miss from Q4 is mostly related to them not communicating on the calls and soft demand from wholesale that has since picked up. This seems counter intuitive but it helps explain the inventory build up in Q4.\n* **Purple has 3% of the Mattress Market but 6% of the premium market.**\n* Purple expects 31-36% growth for 2021 and 2021 is their investment year that was delayed from 2020.\n* Gross Margins were 47% for Q4 and they indicated they would likely remain flat in 2022 even with more mix into wholesale.\n* Purple still sees opportunity in cushioning.\n* Purple is launching a new product in early Q2\n* Purple sees tons of runway in DTC through their showrooms and increased efficiency in the online sales.\n* Purple finally is getting capacity constraints out of the way.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4jyfes2ru8l61.png?width=610&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a98eef33412777a097c71825a39a629ce293b01\n\n* Purple has 130M in cash and is self funding 40-50 Million in Capex and still anticipating delivering 90-100M EBITDA\n   * This is the most Bullish thing IMO- investing 50M in capex is bullish AF.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# The BAD\n\nPurple missed revenue in Q4- According to them it was because their communication wasn't clear and analysts over estimated. Purple committed to better communication this year, **thank GOD.**\n\nThe accruals??? wtf- I need help from u/indonesian_activist and u/lurkingsince2006 I don't understand why we didn't have a big fat paper gain.\n\n# The Future\n\n* Purple has beat revenue guidance for the last 2 years by significant amounts, this will become challenging the bigger they get but I expect this year will be no different.\n* Wholesale demand is as strong as ever.\n   * &#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0q8wosxyv8l61.png?width=638&format=png&auto=webp&s=5bc08171eb170ba150799d149abacc0c1e814f40\n\n* There is still ample opportunity for operational leverage\n   * &#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/elj6j0ogw8l61.png?width=633&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b03ee352ad5a340c7e57017a7964793404f31d3\n\nPurple Management sees no sign of slowing and they anticipate they will be a \"big Player\" in the space.
