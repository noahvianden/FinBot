{"title": "Why a Dem Sweep could Spell BIG BIG Trouble for Tech beyond Tax Increases", "selftext": "As of late, Democrats have surged in the Georgia Senate run-offs, which could spell big trouble for tech companies sporting lofty valuations, especially non-profitable ones.\n\nSo why exactly does a Blue Wave spell trouble for tech companies?\n\nA couple reasons: more fiscal spending, higher inflation expectations, higher interest rates, less valuable long-term cashflows, tech trade crowding, and hedge fund leverage. Let me explain.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Fiscal Spending, Inflation, and Interest Rates**\n\nGenerally speaking, Democratic policy favors a large government budget, and with hopes to spend over\u00a0$5T on clean energy/infrastructure, education, and healthcare Biden's team isn't breaking from the mold. A blue wave would make it much easier for the Biden administration to enact these policies. While Biden is planning on increasing taxes by $3.4T to offset his spending, the government still needs to create money to finance these projects, which\u00a0leads to inflation. Moreover, the Fed has taken a newly lax stance on its price stability mandate, and is\u00a0welcoming inflation of more than 2%, so it won't hesitate to let prices run hot to achieve its inflation target. 10 yr bond yields (and interest rates broadly) tend to be highly correlated to measures of inflation, as its a natural way to dampen the acceleration of rising prices.\u00a0\n\nSummary: dem sweep = higher fiscal spending = higher inflation = higher interest rates\n\n**How This Affects Tech Stock Valuation**\n\nFor all the retards who have never taken a finance course or don't understand basic valuation techniques, the essence of stock valuation is projecting future free cash flows and discounting them back at a risk adjusted rate (b/c $1 is worth more today than $1 five yrs from now, and there's not 100% certainty in the CFs the company might produce in the future). Thus, the main determinant of a company's value is its profitability, the rate at which you discount the company's cash flows, and the time horizon you analyze it at (which can be related to the discount rate). For those actually interested, you can read more\u00a0here. With the current fed funds rate pinned between 0% and .25% and the 10yr yield less than 1%, you can practically look out at a time horizon of 10-20 years before discounting back cash flows. Though still a stretch, interest rates at this level might be able to justify some of the 30-50x price/sales multiples we see in certain growthy tech names at the moment (DDOG's, CRWD's, etc).\u00a0\n\nThat said, if interest rates do begin to rise as a result of a blue sweep, and analysts are forced to incorporate risk free rates of 2-3+% into their discount rates at time horizons where these companies generate little profit, tech companies could see their valuation multiples deteriorate by 50+%. Even just pre-Covid valuation multiples for some growthy names would absolutely crush their stock price. I understand Covid brought forward significant demand for tech companies and in many ways permanently altered consumer behavior, but much of the rise of these companies is based on pure multiple expansion on the basis of forward revenues (not even earnings!), assuming low discount rates and near-infinite time horizons.\u00a0\n\n**Crowded Long Tech Trade**\n\nIt's no real surprise, but according to a December BofA survey, the long technology strategy is the most popular/crowded among fund managers. Also, a year-end Morgan Stanley report indicated that hedge fund gross and net exposure was near all-time highs at 100% and 96%ile, respectively.\n\n**A Quick Note on Leverage**\n\nHedge funds use leverage to amplify returns, and when leverage is cheap (see above), they are more keen to do so. If a hedge fund is levered at 2x, it has $100 of capital to support $200 of positions. A 10% drawdown would leave the fund with $80 of capital to support $180 of positions, with a new leverage multiple of 2.25x. If this were to happen, the fund would have to sell roughly 20% of its book to maintain its leverage ratio. In such a crowded trade, selling like this would cause another fund to liquidate a portion of its holdings to not become over levered, and this self-sustaining cycle of selling persists. An example of this price action and positive feedback loop is the \"Quant Quake\" of 2007 though its trade was less crowded and firms were probably more highly levered.\n\n**Conclusion/TLDR**\n\nA blue wave and higher interest rates (or even the fear/expectation thereof) could quickly unravel the long technology trade due to its crowding, leverage, and a newfound preference for shorter duration cash flows, crushing the stock prices of many tech companies, especially those that are unprofitable in the near term.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Apologies for the lack of images. I've been trying to post this with images since Sunday night. My computer is acting screwy and I can't get anything to upload.

{"title": "Shorting Intel (DD)", "selftext": "I'm in tech and I have good news if you like money. Shorting Intel is too obvious. It's like banging an instagram model for free.\n\n**Why Intel is doomed**\n\nIntel have missed their own deadlines for delivering newer manufacturing methods and their CPUs are falling behind AMD in terms of cost and performance for a while. That is not the news. The stock is already hit by AMD performance. Intel is doomed because our industry is moving to Arm. Arm processors are performing way better at a fraction of cost. See [this report](https://www.anandtech.com/show/15578/cloud-clash-amazon-graviton2-arm-against-intel-and-amd/9) if you're not convinced. What I'm seeing in the industry is that a lot of cloud computing customers are finding it super easy to switch to Arm. Developer computers are mostly Macs and the M1 Macs are just the tip of the iceberg on what's going to happen. Once developers can easily develop on Arm machines, they most likely will deploy their code to an Arm cloud server. Amazon's AWS Graviton is performing well enough to switch.\n\n**Microsoft will kill Intel**\n\nApple is doing their part with M1 and Amazon is balls deep with their Arm chips but what makes a huge difference is Microsoft's energy for fucking intel in the ass by making Windows Arm friendly and pulling a fast one on Intel by developing their own chips.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR**\n\nAmazon, Apple and Microsoft are going to gang bang Intel's wife.

{"title": "Why $WISH has the potential to go to the moon and beyond", "selftext": "This post is in no way financial advice. I\u2019m no expert, I\u2019m just here to explain why I have yolo\u2019d my account into Wish.com shares and calls. I encourage everyone to do their own due diligence. \n\nPart 1: The Basics\n\nWish.com went public on December 16th and nosedived from $23 to $17.45 over the course of about 2 weeks. Wish has rallied over the past two trading days despite the market being red overall. I think the stock is way oversold and potentially hit its bottom last Thursday. Let me spit some quick facts about the company:\n\n- Amazon and Alibaba both offered $10 billion to acquire Wish in 2015. This is obviously prior to the boom e-commerce has received from Covid. Wish\u2019s annual revenue was $300 million at this point. \n- Revenue in 2019 was $2.3 billion, about $800 million more than Shopify in 2019 for reference. \n- Founded by former Google and Yahoo programmers and recently appointed a former Square exec to their board of directors\n- Wish had over 90 million monthly users in 2019, and I believe that number has gone up considerably by now. \n- Most downloaded shopping app of all time with over 500 million downloads.\n- Serves over 100 countries with 3 million transactions a day.\n- No debt and over 1-2 billion in cash\n- In spite of further lockdown news today, Wish went up. I believe this stock is now being recognized as a stay-at-home stock, yet should perform well post-covid due to the longevity of the e-commerce industry as a whole. \n- Although Wish is an American company, many of its merchants are Chinese. I believe Wish might gain in the short term in response to uncertainty over Alibaba\u2019s monopoly investigation. \n- If none of the above has gotten your cock hard yet, Palantir Co-Founder, John Lonsdale, owns 59 million shares of Wish.   \n\nPart 2: Data\n\nData is the new oil bitches. Wish has an absolute fuckton of users, and what sticks out to me is that the majority of purchases made on wish are items that weren\u2019t searched for by the buyer.  These are items recommended by Wish\u2019s algorithm. Only about 15%-20% of purchases made on wish are made through the buyer performing a search. Wish is very effectively using the data they collect to recommend the right products to the right people. If you don\u2019t see the value in that, then fuck you.\n\nAnd may I remind you that John Lonsdale, Data God and Palantir Co-Founder, owns 59 million shares of Wish. \n\nPart 3: The Cons\n\nThe biggest criticisms I\u2019ve seen of Wish is that the product quality can be poor and the shipping time can be poor. These are valid points, however I believe the leadership of this company will make strides in improving upon those two problems, especially when you consider that they just raised a billion dollars in their IPO. Additionally, I\u2019ve seen positive reviews regarding their refund policy. This obviously does not excuse poor product quality and shopping time, but the numbers don\u2019t lie. People are buying shit on Wish. There is a market for cheap, low quality shit and Wish is capitalizing on it hard. If you think Wish is a garbage company, just remember that amazon and alibaba both saw massive value prior to all the growth Wish has had in the last 5 years. \n\nOnce the quiet period is over and Wish releases its first earnings report since they\u2019ve gone public, I\u2019m anticipating a huge run. \n\nPositions: Loaded to the fucking gills with shares and some July 16 $25 calls.
