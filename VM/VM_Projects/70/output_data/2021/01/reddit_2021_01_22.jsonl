{"title": "Serious question to BB gang - should we be worried CFO sold 100% of his shares yesterday?", "selftext": "I'm not going to lie, I got a little worried when I saw that 3 people on executive team -- the head of Enterprise Software, the CMO and CFO -- sold large %'s of their stock holdings on Wednesday (the disclosures are filed on a 1 day lag, so we don't know if more people sold on Thursday).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Insider sales reported for 1\\/20\\/21](https://preview.redd.it/xv97r6hxztc61.png?width=1029&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0addeb69528319ebcd8298ef331c6b7e73e4316)\n\nIt wasn't the $ amount that worried me as much as it was how much of their holdings they sold. Like if John Chen sold 5% or even 10% of his stock tomorrow, I wouldn't blame him or think anything of it. He's probably got his whole net worth tied up in the stock, can't blame a brotha for taking some $ off the table to de-risk your life. But the CMO's sold 60% of his shares (at $12.63), and the **CFO literally sold 100% of his shares** (at $13.01).\n\nPublic SEC filing link here: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1070235/000107023521000005/xslF345X03/wf-form4\\_161126457390819.xml](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1070235/000107023521000005/xslF345X03/wf-form4_161126457390819.xml)\n\n[CFO owns 0 shares after his open market sale ](https://preview.redd.it/qz4vql4uztc61.png?width=1571&format=png&auto=webp&s=e53203a0ca81774255f48b94f7f202402d0022ba)\n\nAnd looking at the filing, it doesnt look like this was part of preset sale plan that he just unluckily turned on before the stock went up. I looked at his last stock sale in October, and the footnotes are pretty explicit. So he genuinely just looked at the price on the screen and by his own free will decided to sell every share he owned as soon as the stock hit $13.\n\nIgnore for a moment the fact that he's been CFO for 7 years and owns fewer shares than at least 10% of the autists on here (wtf). **More importantly, if his stake is so low that it's clearly not a big % of his net worth, why sell literally every share he owns instead of riding them to the moon?** You'd think that guy would have been like \"thank god people finally see the value we know is coming, now would be the best time for me to **BUY** shares since I own so few right now, and that'll help this thing moon even faster!\"\n\nAnd since these don't get filed for a day or two, we don't know if other people also sold yesterday. But if it turns out the guy running QNX also sold 1/2 his shares, that's going to be even worse.\n\nAm I just being paranoid and reading too much into this? It's sad to say but unfortunately I can't just walk off losing 20% of my life savings like some of the other autists on here, like that would really suck.  Real talk, does this give anyone else pause for concern?\n\n**EDIT:** some people saying in comments that this was a pre-arranged sale. First, I don't think that's correct. It looks pretty clear that when it is tied to a pre-arranged plan, the filing explicitly says so. (also who does a pre-arranged sale for 100% of their stock in one transaction?)Also, I just googled it, and apparently if it was a pre-arranged plan, it wouldn't have said the note that says the sales were done in multiple transactions at different prices, because if it's pre-arranged, the sale would've happened automatically wherever stock opened that day (hence why the GME example just has one transaction / one price). So the fact that it was multiple transactions means he pulled the trigger himself in the middle of the day.\n\nEasiest to see when you compare to what it looks like for a pre-arranged sale. Look at this example from GME: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1315015/000132638015000218/xslF345X03/wf-form4a\\_144555581244023.xml](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1315015/000132638015000218/xslF345X03/wf-form4a_144555581244023.xml)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/itinu82p9uc61.png?width=1912&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2f64c43c3410983511a61f3d7d7495865c58679\n\nSecond point raised was that that's not 100% of his stock since it doesn't include RSU's or new shares he'd receive in December. But if you look at his earlier sales this year (which were much smaller), the filings says if he has RSU's, as well as if the sale was just related to selling shares that vested. If the last shares vested on 9/30/20, I don't think the next tranche would've vested on Jan 22nd, they would've already vested on 12/31/20.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3n0dcs3t8uc61.png?width=1552&format=png&auto=webp&s=d696c236452d4ebc562e4586ebb25c7a87e991a3\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1070235/000107023520000132/xslF345X03/wf-form4\\_160193042799067.xml](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1070235/000107023520000132/xslF345X03/wf-form4_160193042799067.xml)", "id": "l2ifeh", "created_utc": 1611299376.0, "score": 60, "upvote_ratio": 0.69, "num_comments": 69, "comments": [{"body": "CFO only had $400k?
