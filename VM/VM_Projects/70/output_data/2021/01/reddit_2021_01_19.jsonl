{"title": "Against Value Investing in 2021 \u2013 Why an intrinsic value of a stock does not matter when majority of other investors do not care about intrinsic value.", "selftext": "Disclaimer: Logic outlined below only applies from March 2020 onwards until the eventual stock market crash. After the bear market hits, absolutely please revert back to value investing.\n\n\nValue investing is hard work \u2013 it requires the investor to evaluate the intrinsic value of a stock by careful analysis of the financial statements, researching company\u2019s present and planned future state and looking out for any political factors. You could easily spend 1 week just researching one stock to convince yourself that you are ready to invest say $10,000 into that company.\n\nSo it is understandable that most retail investors do not bother to do their due diligence before investing in a company. It ought be noted that sub 100 word posts on reddit with rocket emojis shilling another meme penny stock does not count as DD by any measure of the word diligence when you look it up on the dictionary \u2013 \u201ccareful and persistent work or effort\u201d. \n\nIf anything, doing your due diligence might harm your gains in this unprecedented bull market. A stock could go up 3 x times in that week it would take you to do your research and you would have missed the boat by then already.\n\nSo, what determines the value of a stock to begin with? Intrinsic value plays a part, however ultimately it is the investment community BELIEF in what the stock is worth. It does not matter if the intrinsic value of a stock calculated after careful research is $10. IF the investor community at large believe and are willing to pay $100 for this stock, the value of the stock will climb to $100.\n\nAn intelligent investor in 2021 should not waste their time doing their due diligence trying to calculate the intrinsic value of a stock, INSTEAD they should spend their time gauging the opinion of the general investor community to evaluate what they BELIEVE the stock could be worth.\n\nConsider the following example. \n\nA value investor in Jan 2021 might ask themselves: should I invest in PLUG as a topical example. The company has never made a profit and is currently is in net debt. However due to their forward-looking technology, a reasonable investor might say a fair value is around $10 to $30.\n\nMeanwhile at the same time, a rookie investor browsing reddit in Jan 2021 might ask themselves, should I invest in PLUG? They do some research on reddit and find the company is already up at $60, however with the company still having significant meme potential and the sustainable energy / EV boom currently ongoing, the reddit investor might say: this bull run will run for a while so there is no reason to say PLUG won\u2019t reach $100 by end of the year. By that logic, investing into PLUG at $60 is very reasonable and intelligent, you could make a near 2 x return in a short time frame.\n\nTo sum up: being ignorant of the intrinsic value of a stock can be profitable just before the end of a bull run being propped up by artificial manipulation of interest rates by the federal reserve. If you want to make any serious profits in 2021, I\u2019d suggest to give up any pre-conceived notions of value investing and ride the wave until it lasts instead of sitting on the side-lines.", "id": "l0gci4", "created_utc": 1611048036.0, "score": 96, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 73, "comments": [{"body": "There\u2019s also the idea of investing in value stocks now so when the rotation into value happens post crash you\u2019re already there.\n\nI\u2019m mostly in value because my non value plays are all insanely risky ( I\u2019m heavily into GME and a few other options only plays).

You'll probably end up selling at a small dip.\n\n2) This has basically never worked. None of the ultra rich investors today made their money off consistently pulling what you're suggesting. There have been dozens of bull/bear markets. Warren Buffett didn't come out and say \"Just ride the bull marker and bounce when it turns bear\". Why has there never ever been someone who could consistently do this? That should be a clue.\n\n3) What data do we have to suggest reddit is actually moving stocks? We can at best say, they might have moved a $2.4B stock today (GME). This is quite insignificant. I don't think people understand how little of the worlds wealth these people represent, or how small $2.4B in market cap is.

Insane.***\n\n# Aurinia: The Underdog\n\n# Context:\n\nFirst off, the voclosporin drug Aurinia's been working on is up for FDA approval on Friday, though it's their only project as of right now, and that's probably why the stock is down for 1y. The government in the U.K. already approved a drug for the same disease (Ticker GSK) a month or so ago, the stock all but stayed the same. Though, it's rumored that Aurinia's could be far better.\n\nAurinia had a massive jump back in Feb. 2017 due to a combination of project news, a lot of institutional buying, hype, etc. though shares came back to reality (-30%ish) after a insider share lockup period ended. Gives me Nikola vibes. Eew.\n\nAlso got cannoned up in late 2019 mainly due to project news.\n\nDisease name is lupus nephritis, if you want to do more research on their drug.\n\n**Financials and Growth:**\n\nNot profitable in the slightest, at least as of right now. 60m in total liabilities, but a surprising 1 million dollars in debt (To banks/institutions) which is far less than expected. Around -.28 EPS as of Q3, but that may soon change, with the ongoing project and it's offshoots. They've been operating at a large loss\n\n**Current and Future Revenue:**\n\nNow, onto the JUICY stuff! Projections and guesswork galore!\n\nWell, as far as current... there is none. The reason why they have so much (55%) institutional shareholders is because of the fact that they haven't had a single million dollars roll through the bank and they need a constant medical bag full of funding from the big boys on Wall Street.\n\nAs far as the future, AUPH's leadership team has put together a plan of ruthless investment into their pharmaceuticals to make themselves a big player in Canada. That's part of the reason why they blew through 100m+ last year.\n\nWith this drug they're making, well... Let me just tell you the details.\n\nGSK, the company from earlier, has it's headquarters in and mainly operates in the U.K. Aurinia, however, operates in both Canada and the U.S.\n\nThe disease is named Lupus Nephritis, or autoimmune disease. It's a worse case of normal lupus, and is far more deadly. There's currently no cure, and doctors around the world almost always only tread the symptoms.\n\nIf their drug is good enough to provide stable treatment of the actual disease itself, then they could be in for billions in revenue as they expand around the world. My current projection is 5.5bn by 2025, and 1bn if something goes wrong along the way.\n\nAurinia as a company is rated as \\~70% undervalued, taken from a total of around 20 stock analysts. They're negative as far as revenue, though if this drug becomes widespread, they could become very revenue positive (Can't say profitable just yet, might not happen 'til 2022 or later)\n\nOther info:\n\n* A whopping 90% of analysts have price targets above APHA's current share price!!! Holy cow!\n* Every line of resistance imaginable points to an rocket in either direction, though they point more upward than downward. There's been a wedge for the past year, and an FDA approval Friday could turn this into either a WeWork or a Tesla. We will see.\n\nI also want to note that the site that I use for DD is rating Aurinia's fair value at $110. So... Value + Growth stock? Fatal disease curing spurred Tesla-like breakout? We'll find out Friday!\n\n***TL,DR: Stock could go up 50%+ on approval, or it could go down -50%+, as this one drug is basically it's entire future. Revenue with FDA approval could be as high as 5bn by 2025.***\n\n*How I'm playing it: (Not financial advice,* *~~don't get me arrested~~*\\*)\\*\n\nI plan on buying a whole bunch of shares, doing a risky call spread with Feb. expiry, then buying a LEAP and/or selling a put or two. Should come out to 3k to 10k, depending on how much money I want to possibly erase off the face of the Earth.\n\nAs of writing this, it's up 4% in premarket already. The news is starting to get around a bit.\n\nAlso, if someone from Canada here can tell me what the prices are early on CSX, that'd be great.\n\n**Sources:**\n\n[https://simplywall.st/stocks/ca/pharmaceuticals-biotech/tsx-aup/aurinia-pharmaceuticals-shares](https://simplywall.st/stocks/ca/pharmaceuticals-biotech/tsx-aup/aurinia-pharmaceuticals-shares)\n\n[https://endpts.com/after-losing-race-for-first-to-market-in-lupus-nephritis-aurinia-taps-otsuka-for-voclosporin-licensing-pact-abroad/](https://endpts.com/after-losing-race-for-first-to-market-in-lupus-nephritis-aurinia-taps-otsuka-for-voclosporin-licensing-pact-abroad/)\n\n(Seeking Alpha link would go here if the damn AutoMod didn't take down my post.)\n\n[https://ir.auriniapharma.com/](https://ir.auriniapharma.com/)\n\n[https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/\\_d5224235ef1d27ef939d1c33666b318d/auriniapharma/db/246/991/pdf/Aurinia\\_Presentation\\_-CorpDeck-FINAL\\_Jan21.pdf](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_d5224235ef1d27ef939d1c33666b318d/auriniapharma/db/246/991/pdf/Aurinia_Presentation_-CorpDeck-FINAL_Jan21.pdf)\n\n[https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/aurinia-stock-to-surge-by-80-this-5-star-analyst-thinks-its-possible-2020-11-13](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/aurinia-stock-to-surge-by-80-this-5-star-analyst-thinks-its-possible-2020-11-13)\n\n**Bearish source, for good balance:**\n\n[https://www.macroaxis.com/invest/market/AUPH--Aurinia-Pharmaceuticals](https://www.macroaxis.com/invest/market/AUPH--Aurinia-Pharmaceuticals)\n\nthanks for coming to my TedTalk.
