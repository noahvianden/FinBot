This came in roughly 18 million shares of common stock, and 18 million warrants. \n\nThen weed stocks pretty much pumped and dumped, then floundered in the low single digits\n\nMay 2020: Constellation [increases stake](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/constellation-brands-raises-stake-in-canopy-growth-to-38.6-percent-2020-05-05) to 38.6% by exercising those 18 million warrants for roughly $10/sh (12.97 CAD), and puts another $**4 billion** into CGC. In total owning 158 million shares, *ANOTHER* 140 million warrants, and like 150 million of senior debt. \\*NOTE\\* the warrants from the 10/17 deal were \\~33% below market value (CGC was $15/sh on 11/1/17 so using that logic the warrants acquired on 5/5/20 should be roughly the same cost basis since CGC was $15/sh on May 5th).\n\nFully diluted, they actually **CONTROL** Canopy Growth: \"Collectively, the common shares now increase Constellation Brand's ownership of Canopy Growth to 38.6 percent of the issued and outstanding common shares. Assuming full exercise of all remaining warrants and full conversion of the notes, Constellation Brands would own a nearly 55.8 percent stake in Canopy Growth.\"\n\nPretty fucking sweet, right?

{"title": "Pot Bubble 2.0 Coming", "selftext": "tl;dr - Pot will be legalized for recreational use, with federal prohibition entirely removed, within the year. Many states are already legal, many more have announced full legalization plans. Local governments around the country are in dire financial straits and this both saves money and generates additional tax revenue. Business goes from \"gray area\" to approved, entering the era of big business and finance getting more involved.  \n\n^(I haven't had the time to research the best valued companies yet so my money is just on MJ calls, $16-20, 2-12 months out, and other ETFs for now...)\n\nIt's been surprising to see the weak price action on pot stocks this week after Democrats took both GA seats, not because of any hope but because it's already been solidified that weed will be nationally legal for recreational use this time next year. It looks like a piece of legislation passed on December 4th went under the markets radar.  \n\nThe Democratic controlled house has *already* [passed the \"MORE\" act](https://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2020-12-04/house-approves-federal-marijuana-decriminalization-in-historic-vote) which removes federal prohibition on Marijuana and leaves it to the states. This is significant for many obvious reasons, most important of which is turning a \"gray\" business for (multi-)national companies (e.g financial institutions) into an approved one, which will add fuel to the sectors growth.  \n\nBiden has *already* been certified as the next president of the United States. Both GA runoffs have *already* resulted in Democratic control of the Senate. There is almost no scenario in which weed isn't legalized within the year on a federal level. As I'm sure many of you know, states around the country not only spend huge amounts of money through courts prosecuting these cases, but are also in dire financial straits due to the pandemic. \n\nNow what can both save money while generating additional tax revenue? Legalization. With federal prohibition removed, many states already allowing recreational use, and many more with plans to, the dominos will start falling. Why would NC give up all this tax revenue to CO, much less when they have multiple connected states with the same options also competing?", "id": "kterwl", "created_utc": 1610148890.0, "score": 46, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 72, "comments": [{"body": "Buy the sell, rumor the news", "score": 66, "replies": [{"body": "I\u2018m always surprised how slow some people can be.

There's already a huge push for federal support to the hardest hit states and budgets being reconsidered, so there will be both fiscal and political pressure for quick legalization.  \n\nFinally, you mention Big Pharma as an opponent, and one with extreme influence obviously.
