This is imperative since it's attrition when buying and a payout when selling.  [https://www.optionseducation.org/advancedconcepts/theta](https://www.optionseducation.org/advancedconcepts/theta)\n* Understand delta in general and how delta changes with ITM and OTM options.\n* Understand all the greeks at a high level, as you get better understand them well.

In general, you want to sell when IV is high and buy when the IV is low.  Increasing  IV is good for held calls/puts.  IV drop or crush is generally good for sellers.\n* Selling options can be quite beneficial.  Once you have a good general understanding, lookup r/thetagang .  Kamikaze Cash has good youtube videos on most theta strategies.  I personally believe selling options (especially cash secured) is much safer and can consistently make you profits.  Theta Gang 4 life.\n* Understand that WSB is gambling and factor in the information accordingly.  That sub is hilarious, but be careful with meme stocks.\n* FOMO and how to avoid chasing a dangerous trend.  DO NOT CHASE FROM FOMO!\n* What intrinsic and extrinsic value are.  Know how they are affected by being exercised/assigned and how theta affects them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Basics / Mechanics**\n\n* Understand the 4 \"main\" option types.  Buying or selling a call and buying or selling a put.  Spreads and more complex option strategies are based off these in some way.\n* You can sell calls with 100 shares of stock of if you own an underlying longer term option; see PMCC later.  Selling calls naked is incredibly risky and requires Level 4 (very advanced) permissions and often a lot of capital.  I will literally never sell calls naked since I don't want to ruin my life.\n* Puts can be sold/written cash covered (cash secured), which means you have the cash in your account to buy 100 shares.  Your broker will put this money on hold until the trade is closed.  Puts can be sold \"naked\" using Margin and Level 3 (with most brokers).  Your broker will hold a percentage of cost of 100 shares (often 30-40%, 100% on meme stocks) allowing you to sell more puts.  This increases your available capital/power as well as risk.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**General Tips (Save these for later):**\n\n* **Don't EVER leave spreads open on expiration day, close them.  (more details below)**\n* Start off trading very small.  Slowly build up over weeks / months.  You need to get accustomed to a fifty dollar swing a day, then a few hundred, then a few thousand.  You need to ensure you don't get emotional (see below).\n* As you build up the amount of money you have invested, keep it separated among several stocks.  Don't go all in on one thing ever\n* Don't trade emotionally.  If you realize you are emotionally trading for vengeance, you should probably exit the trade and cool off for several days with that stock.\n* Have a plan for every trade, ideally with entries / exits that are specific values, ranges, or a set condition.  This helps remove emotions.\n* Use an options profit calculator from your broker or an online one before entering a \"new\" trade, especially a complex multi legged trade: [https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com](https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/)/\n* Consider using stop losses to lock in profits on rides up or sometimes use them to prevent losses.  Note, stops can be easily triggered in volatile options.  Now when I'm up a lot on calls (especially around earnings or large momentum run-ups) I always set stop losses.  I have been burned too many times.  In December I didn't set a SL on several thousand dollars of FDX calls and I \"lost\" \\~$5K of unrealized gains.   If you're up big don't get too greedy.\n* Incrementally enter positions on large rises / falls.  This helps combat FOMO and helps you avoid getting slaughtered.  This will also help you avoid \"chasing a falling knife\".  This also ties into having a plan.  I set alerts at several predetermined prices and I REALLY try not to enter new trades unless I hit my preset points.  It makes me less emotional and usually more effective.\n* Don't throw good money after bad.  Don't gamble on a recovery if your assumption appears to be wrong or the market is flat out tanking.\n* On gains, consider taking profits and \"rolling up\" or incrementally sell your contracts at several different prices (this is why having multiple contracts is nice).\n* A possible strategy if a stock is on a tear and you have multiple options open:  Close some positions (I prefer to do this incrementally if the stock has momentum), but leave 1+ open in case the stock goes on a tear.  Next, set a stop loss with a little buffer below it's current movement / range so it doesn't get hit unless the stock falls hard.  Finally, watch the stock closely and if it keeps rising, keep moving the stop loss up incrementally.  This will let you keep more profits on a hot streak, but give some protection and secure more gains.  It will also help eliminate FOMO if a stock exceeds your expectations.\n* If you have a losing trade, re-evaluate it.  If your initial assumption was incorrect, close it.  Don't stay in losing trades forever and lose the entire value of the option.  If you re-evaluate and you think your assumption was right, hold, potentially consider adding another cheaper option (buy another call / put).\n* Don't try to daytrade, especially with options.  It's incredibly statistically unlikely to be profitable.\n* Try not to over-trade, you'll likely mis-time the market over time.  When I get emotional I over trade, then lose additional money on wash sales.  If you scale your entries into positions it should help alleviate your desire to exit positions when they turn badly against you.  Whenever I buy calls I do it at larger increments after W almost made me loss my hair; luckily it eventually came back.\n* Learn about wash sale rules.  They suck and are very easy to activate with options.  This will eliminate your ability to write off losses.  Over trading can easily cause wash sales.\n* As you gain experience, start monitoring what kind of Delta, OTM, DTE, etc you are most profitable with.  Use it in your future trades.  You'll often see the tasty trade 30-45DTE .3 Delta strategy for selling.\n* NEVER enter a position on a stock you have no idea about, especially when you read about it online or heard about it from some rando.\n* When selling (or buying) look at rough technicals like resistances and supports to consider your strikes and exit points.\n* Once you have a good amount of experience, check out LEAPs and poor man's covered calls, they're cool (see below)\n* At market open options contracts are often volatile and inflated.  Buying during this time can be more expensive.  Options are usually cheaper mid day, I read somewhere 2-3PM is cheapest.\n* Try wheeling on cheaper stocks once you get all fundamentals down.\n* If selling options, it is okay to close early after a large gain with many DTE.  See TT videos / strategy on this.\n* As you start to sell options and get more experience in general you'll start seeing the two sides to every trade.  You will likely start adjusting your strategies or trying new trades out because of this.  Things will click one day and most/all the greeks and overall market dynamics will become almost second nature.\n* If selling, consider rolling (for a credit) to avoid assignment when it makes sense / meets your plan.  Rolling closer to expiration can be valid strategy to get theta on your side.  On the flip side if the stock moons or plummets it could've been better to roll before it got crazy deep ITM.\n* Stagger strikes for safety / diversity (optional).\n* Don't hold options through earnings unless you literally want to gamble.  I do like playing on earnings run up, but that can be risky.\n* When selling, if you hold through earnings, IV crush will happen immediately afterwards devaluing the option.  However, if the news is good and the stock is way above the strike IV crush won't help you.\n* **I repeat this on purpose: Don't EVER leave spreads open on expiration day, close them.  If you don't close, they better be VERY far from the strike on a non-volatile stock.  In after hours a stock can jump/dip below your strike and be exercised without the other leg to protect you.  This can lead to massive, life ruining losses.  This is not an exaggeration, google this and be scared.  It happened to a fair number of people with TSLA.**\n* Spreads are neat because they manipulate how delta and theta act.  It caps your gains and losses, but you can profit with less stock movement.  Try several spreads on a P/L calculator to see for yourself.  I'm Theta Gang, so I like selling credit spreads sometimes since I profit from neutral movement and theta... sweet sweet theta.\n* When selling puts if you are very bullish consider \"doubling down\".  Use the credit from your put sale to buy shares or a cheap call.  This can be roughly inversed with puts, except I wouldn't recommend shorting shares.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-**Intermediate / Advanced Strategies (work in progress)-**\n\n**Iron Condor and Iron Butterflies**\n\n* Iron condor and Iron butterflies.  These strategies profit from neutral or mostly neutral stock movement.  They benefit from theta decay.  If your stock is range bound, these may be a good choice.  The condor can be riskier and skinny with a narrow high profit range or wide for a much greater chance of success with low payout.  These are both 4 \"legged\" trades, so you will have 4 trading fees to enter or exit the trade.  A lower cost or zero cost broker shines here.  Condors and butterflies have \"wings\" which are your purchased puts and calls.  The wider the wing the higher the max profit/risk.\n* The butterfly is similar except instead of a plateau it has a sharp peak.  My personal mental note is a condor looks more like a strangle while a butterfly looks like a straddle.\n\n**LEAPs**\n\n* LEAP Options are options that are long term with many DTE, often over a year until expiration.  LEAP calls are great for long term growth plays (downtrends with LEAP puts) or simply when you really like a company and can't afford 100 shares.  LEAPs (or any \"longer term\" option) enables you to sell a PMCC or PMCP (below)\n\n**PMCC / PMCP**\n\n* PMCC or PMCP are poor man's covered call or poor man's covered puts.  They are diagonal options often used with purchased LEAPs.  You sell a shorter DTE call/put with a further OTM strike than your purchased call/put.  For PMCC/PMCPs it is often recommended to recoup your extrinsic value as soon as possible, some recommend with your first call CC or put sale, to ensure you are positive if the option is assigned early.  These have a lot of moving parts and strategies.  If you buy a barely ITM call/put and sell a nearby strike call/put you run the risk of the purchased option getting \"blown by\" on large stock movement and ending up with a very negative losing trade.  Keeping your purchased LEAP deeper ITM should protect you.  Check your initial PMCC using an options calculation to make sure you don't screw up.\n* I'm currently tinkering with these myself.  So far I like .7-.9 delta call LEAPS with 30-45 DTE calls on my CC.  The goal is to hold the LEAP long term, potentially until expiration, and constantly sell calls/puts on it that expire worthless.  Typically the call/put is rolled up and out or down and out if it's going to be assigned, unless you don't want your LEAP anymore.\n* Some people look at these many sold CC or puts as profits, I look at them as lowering my cost basic until it's zero (or even negative).  I have a page in my notebook I write each CC on my NIO LEAP (I MEME stock sometimes).  I find it satisfying to slowly see the cost of the original option disappear.  When I originally wrote this I had \\~2 years left on it and it's 9-10% paid for; that doesn't even count the actual gains the LEAP has.\n* TT states this is considered an IV play, which I partially agree with.  You want to buy these during low IV times since an IV drop will hurt your LEAP value.  I look at them more like a way to sell calls/puts on a high IV company with a lot of price movement and potential upside/downside.\n\nDisclaimer/bio: I'm just a guy who trades (mainly options) part-time for financial gain and fun.  I've been pretty successful trading options, especially with theta (selling) strategies.  I got heavily involved with options again in September 2020 after a long hiatus.\n\nEdit: my first gold.

Took a no joke 7ish year break and came back late this year.  I then re-read that entire book and hit the internet, reddit, and YouTube hard.\n\nI scaled up slowly in August with contracts worth only several hundred dollars.  I felt like a beginner here.  I increased my account sized to 30-45k and started doing 1k ish options next month, I felt comfortable with basic strategies here.  1 month later I moved in more money and was trading with over 100k because I understood the overall mechanics of options very well at this point and had defined strategies.\n\nI gradually escalated my quantities, option value, and variety / type of trades as I got more comfortable.  I would say in 2 months of constant trading and research.  This was a major hobby.  I spent several hours many days, things clicked and I became comfortable.  I understand some middle tier concepts now like synthetic options and the 2 sides of every trade.\n\nI will now buy 3-4k calls, which I would've pooped my pants for initially.  I'll hold much larger positions more comfortably.  I can shrug off a 1k daily loss (on over 100k account).  A 5k daily loss makes me unhappy, but if it's just one day I can handle it.\n\nI buy calls and puts less because I think it's riskier.  I have lost 75% of a 2k call value being stupid earlier on.  I learned a lot from that.  I entered W calls way too heavily 1-2 months ago and was down very signicantly and revaluating my position.   I was down over 10k unrealized.  I was right and held out so it worked out.  However I got scared and over traded losing at least 2-3k plus wash sales.\n\nI haven't been completely taken off my feet because I try to diversify, act intelligently, and don't sell puts too close to strikes.  That being said I'm hurting today since I got cocky / sloppy with several FDX puts I sold too close together and 3k in calls I bought.  I'm down 3k today and that just sucks.  I don't feel too terrible because I'm still positive in this short 2021 YTD.  I take solace in the fact that I'm up YTD and try to realize I can't win every trade.  If I was down YTD my stress levels would be much higher.\n\nOverall I was way up last year trading with a large account in October to December.  I don't have exact figures because e trade is weird with reporting and I kept adding more money to my account. but I think I did roughly 15-20% in  ~ 3 months.  Again I'm just a guy, not trying to sell you on any strategy or brag, just educate in general.\n\nMost of these things I wrote for the guide were learned through painful trades and losses.  Loss of sleep and stress.  I would start small and get used to the emotional roller coaster stocks can be slowly building your order sizes and amounted invested as you get more knowledgeable.
