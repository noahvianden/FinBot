{"title": "Stocks to Watch 29/01/2021", "selftext": "Good Morning,\n\nMarket conditions still hugely volatile. Yesterday was a controversial day for some with brokers placing restrictions on trading certain stocks. SIEB (Siebert Financial) is our leading gapper at the time of writing, but I'm not including it in today's list as it shows all the signs and characteristics of a 'Pump and Dump' with no fundamental catalyst. Here are the ones I'll be watching today.\n\n1. **$LMFA (LM Funding America) -** The catalyst with LMFA appears to be them announcing the closing of its upsized IPO of 10.35 million units (which included the full exercise of the underwriters\u2019 over-allotment option). This was experiencing a big selloff but is now sitting above the VWAP and climbing. I'll be watching this one at open. Breaking $3.47 will be key; short float at 26.42%.\n2. $**KOSS and $GME -** I really begrudge stocks like these, but can't help buying the dips where I see technical patterns. My advice remains to be careful with these. Short squeezes are still taking place, but these are still wildly overvalued and due another crash. Remember it's Friday and a lot of people will be closing their positions. \n3. **$NVAX (Novavax) -** COVID-19 vaccine proved to be 90% effective. Float here is a little high for me, up at 45.1m, but this is a nice setup for me and one I'll be watching.\n\nI'm going to tread very carefully today, more so than I have been all week. I suspect most activity will once again be with KOSS and GME, with them essentially mirroring each other, but there will be ample safer opportunities to those of us who are more risk-averse \n\nOther stocks I will be watching: AMC, CATB, NAKD, EXPR, PSAC.\n\nAs a reminder, trading is risky, make sure you put stops in place and follow your initial plan regardless.\n\n**Discord** \\- I've made a Discord community a couple of days ago, the join link is pinned to my profile.\n\nThanks all - have a good weekend.\n\n\\-Rep", "id": "l7thfj", "created_utc": 1611929588.0, "score": 71, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 69, "comments": [{"body": "Day trading GME is honestly just a big mistake imo.

Every last call owner until 250 will be massacred today, a good thing if you wrote 275 (covered or naked) calls a few weeks ago instead of buying them.\n\nThen here is the [same story with FB puts](https://ibb.co/8zgsFgs), with nearly 40,000 of them being massacred out in the open. The max pain area for FB for the day will be between 250 and 257, the lower it goes, you should pick up any option expiring next month or later.\n\nThe story is the same for AAPL, AMD, and MSFT where everyone is getting slaughtered regardless of their position's side. For AAPL the max pain area seems to be $130 to $131, AMD's is $87-$88, and anything above $88C or below $87P is well butchered. MSFT's max pain is around $230 to $235, anything above $235C and below $230P is wrecked. Again, puts will be up today, there is no doubt about it given the market bleed, but they are only up relative to yesterday.\n\nI can see us trading for the rest of day within those thresholds, and personally, it's a great time to pick up cheap calls for FEB. I welcome all criticism and thoughts... also, not financial advice.\n\n**Positions:**\n\n1. AAPL 3x $150C FEB 26 @ $1.6\n2.

{"title": "This is a value play and it always has been, regulators pls read", "selftext": "Mods please don't fuck me this took more effort than it should have.\n\n**TL;DR:  the GME shorts made one of the most braindead plays in market history,  and should have seen this coming from miles away. GameStop is a VALUE  play beyond the squeeze and is fairly valued at $200-500+ per share in a  stable market.**\n\n***Full  disclosure: I have an IQ equal to the number of employees at Citron  Research and a diet consisting of mostly Crayola crayons.***\n\nThis is for everyone who is catching up with the story of GameStop.\n\nGME  was removed from the S&P 500 in April of 2016 in the midst of their  slumping performance in a gaming market shifting away from physical  media and retailers. At that time, GME market cap was just over $3b and  steadily shrinking.\n\nThe company\u2019s  bleed continued into late 2019, eventually bottoming out with an  8-figure market cap. Digital competition was rapidly increasing and  GameStop was not able to move quickly enough to adapt its business  model. They were getting bent by Amazon, bent by Microsoft, bent  by Sony. Gay bears were gleefully jerking each other off on the massive  piles of put and short tendies, but something was brewing.\n\nEven though the losses were piling on, GME was able to reserve cash *above*  its own market cap: around $500m in August 2019. This cash, and their  international brand name, were really the only two things the company  had going for it at the time.\n\nEnter Dr. Michael Burry, The Holy King Autismo. **Bull Bomb #1** \\- [Burry wrote a letter](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190819005633/en/)  to the GME Board recommending massive share repurchasing with the  company\u2019s existing cash. Burry\u2019s thesis was that repurchasing would  greatly increase EPS and position the company extremely well ahead of a  future sales boost from the 2020-2021 console cycle \u2013 consoles which  would indeed have disc drives. Buybacks would give GME more capital to  utilize, decrease their dividend burden, and allow a true transition.  Burry was in it to the hilt.\n\nGME  had already begun buying shares back, and they took Burry\u2019s advice to  buy back even more. In 2019, the company repurchased a total of $178.6m  in shares, representing about 34% of the company. Short interest was a  whopping 63% in mid-2019 with bears refusing to believe that any future  was possible for the brand. 9000-grit sandpaper couldn\u2019t make their  brains any smoother.\n\nEnter [u/DeepFuckingValue](https://www.reddit.com/u/DeepFuckingValue/),  helicoptering his throbbing bull cock from the top of Mount Olympus.  Burry\u2019s letter generated some chatter on the sub but the sentiment  around GameStop remained mixed at best.  As far as I can remember DFV  was among the first on WSB to take a long position, and fuck he took a  big one: $53k on calls with various strikes. Almost every single comment  on his original posts was very gay and very bearish. [u/j1187064](https://www.reddit.com/u/j1187064/)  captured it best: \u201cOh, right, I forgot shit companies that are barely  clinging to life always come roaring back from terrible earnings.\u201d\n\nGameStop\u2019s  most critical moves came in 2020. The board got a big shake up in early  2020 with a focus on pivoting the business model to something slightly  less retarded. COVID fucked their retail sales squarely in the ass but  accelerated what was a much-needed expansion of their e-commerce arm.  **Bull Bomb #2** \\- digital sales jumped over 500% YoY, and this was **not** just for the new consoles. Still, short interest was increasing.\n\nEnter Ryan Cohen, one of the few men on earth who might win a dick measuring contest against King [u/DeepFuckingValue](https://www.reddit.com/u/DeepFuckingValue/).  RC had been accumulating shares in multiple purchases throughout 2020,  eventually positioning himself atop the list of stakeholders. Rumors  were flying on the sub about a Cohen takeover of GME, and sure enough,  this materialized on January 11th, 2021. **Bull Bomb #3, nuclear  edition**. The board underwent another massive shakeup, now with Cohen,  Alan Attal, and Jim Grube from Chewy. This was the moment. Ryan Cohen,  founder of the now $43b e-commerce titan Chewy, with Board seats on  GameStop. GME was $20 per share at the time, with around 140% short  interest.\n\nWe\u2019ve all seen what has  happened in the 17 days since Chewy took the Board. WSB piled in and  DFV\u2019s balls experienced a condensed millennium of carbon pressurization  into the largest diamonds on planet earth. My only wish is that one day  he fucks my wife.\n\nSo why is  GameStop a value play, you ask? I don\u2019t like to estimate the nebulous  value of the gaming industry because it can be cut in so many different  ways, but it is a whole lot of fucking billions and the industry is  going to be booming for a long time to come. GME now has an incredible  fuckload of capital to work with, and the right people to deploy it.  This is what I think we will see in the near future:\n\n* **Subsidiary expansion**.  GameStop has been playing this game for a long time with varying  degrees of success (aka none), but I think they will continue this  strategy as they pivot their business\n   * **Game developers**  \u2013 there are innumerable great targets GME could acquire to build a  portfolio of games to offer in competition with larger players in the  space. See Microsoft\u2019s 343 Industries, Sony\u2019s 989 Studios, etc.\n   * **Streaming**  \u2013 there is room to grow in the streaming market, even with behemoths  like Twitch and YouTube out there. Streamers themselves aren\u2019t shy to  voice their complaints about the platforms that exist now, and I am  confident that streaming has a lot of room to develop\n* **Strategic partnerships**. The [Microsoft partnership](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-multi-year-strategic-partnership-microsoft)  is something I don\u2019t think has gotten enough attention yet. This is  industry demand for retail partnerships is there, and this deal shows  that it is there in a big way. GME is in a fantastic position to supply  infrastructure and stand on the consumer side on behalf of the largest  producers in the gaming industry. MSFT was the beginning of what I think  will be a massive expansion into these type of partnerships\n* **eCommerce**.  Cohen already proved to the market that Amazon is not the end-all for  web sales - see Chewy. Gaming has fucking yacht loads of product to move  \u2013 consoles, controllers, accessories, discs, hardware, branded merch,  you fucking name it. Check the credit card statement your wife\u2019s  boyfriend uses in your name if you\u2019re wondering how much people spend on  this shit. If you think Cohen isn\u2019t going to move them into dominance  on this you are dead wrong\n\nHot industry. Brand value. All-star board. Massive capital to deploy. Large infrastructure in place. Partnerships forming. This sounds like a many-billion dollar company to me.\n\nI  bet there is are a lot more potential moves to be made for GME here,  this is just what I am thinking we\u2019ll see in 2021. Let me know where you  guys think this rocket will take us.\n\nBuy high, sell never, fuck Citadel, fuck CNBC.\n\nEDIT: fuck, I dropped these... \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80", "id": "l7iq6l", "created_utc": 1611893247.0, "score": 737, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 73, "comments": [{"body": "How dare you give us this thesis without a single \ud83d\ude80", "score": 242, "replies": [{"body": "You know it's a good thesis when there aren't any \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 and retards can still read to the end.\n\nBUY AND HOLD \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c", "score": 80, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.48856016993522644}, {"body": "Give you a pass today, better use rockets next time", "score": 21, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.0675009936094284}, {"body": "Hey, this thesis gave us our new best phrase:\n\n>helicoptering his throbbing bull cock", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "I definitely would\u2019ve noticed that if I could read", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "It's okay.

{"title": "Storytime - How I underestimated the GME movement and lost a million dollars in the process", "selftext": "So little backstory. I've been around the markets for a while but I never did great or paid that much attention until I got into options in 2019. I'm pretty good with numbers and math was always my strong suit, so I felt this was a game I could actually be good at. I was. I turned 50k into close to 5 million this month (I have multiple accounts but IBKR was my main). Most of my big winners were TSLA options (bet big on Q1 2020 earnings using call spreads, and bought a bunch of leaps during COVID dip) and also put a lot of money into things that shall not be named except for in Elon's twitter profile.\n\nNow to GME. I've been following WSB for over a year now I think, so I had seen DFV's posts. I followed a lot of the logic as I've seen short squeezes, gamma squeezes before, and I even followed the logic of the ITM options causing issues this Monday and Tuesday. So I had no position until Tuesday. On Tuesday, I saw not only did IBKR have over a million shares available to short but the fees were going down (I keep both the number of shares shortable and shorting fees visible as I believe this to be valuable information for investing in any stock). So on Tuesday with the stock trading in the 120s-130s, I thought this is going to be done soon.\n\nBoy was I wrong. So I ended up selling 40 naked calls (1/29 $150) when I saw the prices of these spiking as well - average price of between $20-25. Big lesson - don't sell naked calls. I've done it before and it's worked, but it's not worth the risk. So arrogant me leaves these open cause AH trading for GME has been relatively stable. Then Elon tweets and it's all over. Even at the beginning of trading on Wednesday it looked like this bubble was about to pop, but then it shoots up to 365 and I'm liquidated for a total loss of around 1 million dollars.\n\nSo long story short, I completely underestimated the movement and I will forever regret being on the wrong side of history, but I submit my loss porn to all of you degenerates for whatever it is you want to do with it.\n\nimage not showing up?
