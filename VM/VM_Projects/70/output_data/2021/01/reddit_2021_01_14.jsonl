{"title": "Did I invest too much in one lump sum?", "selftext": "Hi there, r/stocks!  \n\n\nA bit of a background: I'm a 27 year old, with a job that provides for my daily income. I recently \"woke up\" to realize that I need to invest the money that's just sitting idle in my bank account, especially since I do not need that much cash right now. So, I decided to invest some of my existing savings in the stock market for the **long term** (buy-and-hold, I'm in no hurry to make gains). This was my **first ever investment**, so I am quite the newbie. I'm hoping to invest a total of around $40,000-$50,000 this year.\n\nNow, a few days ago, I bought stocks worth a total of around **$25,000**, largely in ETFs, **all together**. These are the investments:\n\n1. MSFT: $4k (at around $214)\n2. VGT: $4k (at around $353)\n3. QQQ: $4k (at around $314)\n4. ARKK: $3k (at around $139)\n5. ARKF: $3k (at around $51)\n6. PBW: $3k (at around $123)\n7. ARKG: $2k (at around $106)\n8. ICLN: $2k (at around $126)\n\nI'm now having some second thoughts, and would be grateful to have some of your more qualified opinions on the same:\n\n* Did I make a mistake by investing $25k altogether? I didn't know about DCA (dollar cost averaging) until after I finished buying (sounds stupid, and it is). The reason I'm nervous is because there are opinions that suggest the market is at an all-time high & will pullback massively soon. OTOH, my portfolio looks \"balanced\" & low-risk, but again, I'm not sure. To reiterate, I don't need the $25k cash & am perfectly okay with investing it altogether, *if* the investments make sense.\n* If this is a mistake, how can I fix it? Should I just sell off half my holdings, evenly across the board, and then DCA for the rest of the year?\n* Or, should I keep the safer bets (MSFT, QQQ, VGT) and sell off just the riskier ones (ARK, PBW, ICLN)?\n* Alternatively, should I just hold on, given that I'm here for the long-term?\n\nThank you for reading, and I look forward to learning from you awesome people!", "id": "kx8edi", "created_utc": 1610639964.0, "score": 21, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 70, "comments": [{"body": "Time in the market beats timing the market", "score": 109, "replies": [{"body": "This^^^\nRelax and just monitor your money every few weeks.

{"title": "$GME: Learning from the journey", "selftext": "Hello brothers and sisters in GameStop. My sermon today is an examination of why some of our fellow autists have become millionaires while I continue to live in a cardboard box. \n\nI was an early-ish follower of the $GME faith, but when tribulations came my faith was shaken. I still went to church, but my heart wasn't in it like those we look up to. We must reflect on our failures to grow as followers in Cohen. \n\nThis testimony is long (sorry). I needed to force myself to actually examine things so I don't fuck up the next opportunity for tendies. This is my penance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR**: Retard examining why I made small gains off $GME despite being in months ago. I keep track of all my trades. $GME has been a rollercoaster of emotions and opportunities in a very short time, so lots to learn. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Takeaways\n\n1. I never truly committed or believed in the position. It remained a small % of my portfolio and I was always hedging because being down even a couple % hurt, let alone -20% swings. To find 20X return you have to invest in companies that have significant uncertainty (and volatility). That  means persuasive arguments on both sides. If you lack conviction you won't be able to stay in.  \n2. Follow those charts and imagine you don't know where we end up. Put yourself in that moment. Holy fuck. **Am I buying the dip or catching a falling knife**? This has been bumpy and uncertain. We can all pretend this was a sure thing, it wasn't. It still isn't.\n3. We've all heard Fear and Greed rule the market. Its one thing to say that. Its another to feel it and observe it in yourself. My mood on $GME has flipped from \"This motherfucking boomer CEO is burning all my $\" to \"Fat FIRE, this year, motherfuckers\" 4 times in as many months. I felt intense emotions (still feeling them during the current run). W/o acclimating to balance that out I think its impossible to make good decisions. \n4. I'm very glad I kept detailed notes on what I was doing. Write down your thoughts and reason for taking a position. Revisit these. We're all retards. But that doesn't mean we can't learn our bad habits and improve. I'm stunned looking back by how often I was paralyzed and couldn't take action. \n5. None of this was obvious. There were strong cases that the business was undervalued. It was a good bet. But it was a bet. (Blasphemy you say? The true prophet, RoaringKitty said on yesterday's stream that as June turned into July and August and no PE firm or other investors stepped in he began to wonder if he was right). The business was bleeding cash, it just wasn't hemorrhaging like bears thought. The management is out of touch. COVID could have been worse. The broader market could have sold off, offsetting anything $GME did (and probably making sentiment even worse). \n6. I believe at $30-$40 the core business is reasonably priced and the value thesis is proved out. There are other stories (short squeeze and the business transformation) that remain. IMO these are far less certain, but in this market a good story might be worth $100. \n\n# Charts + comments\n\n[Entering via CCPs](https://preview.redd.it/kyuu2rh4rab61.png?width=2769&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ce9dc1dc310e756ff294b88061557fad2726a50)\n\nI hear about $GME. The business model of buy kids consoles for pennies on the dollar seems lucrative, video game sales in general are good, but COVID + things going digital are big question marks. The stock is up a lot from lows, but only liars buy at the low and sell at the high. Still seems reasonable, I sold weekly $10P (felt good about this).  Put premiums were good (3.6% for 3 days) and I figured I could get write for a couple weeks before being assigned. \n\nAlso, picked up some 1/15/21 $30C (retard FOMO, I even noted as much \"Getting in w/o doing full research based on Burry and Ryan Cohen + extremely high short interest. Very speculative at this point. Console refresh upcoming + GME while not vibrant is healthy balance sheet wise\").\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Assigned... Ok, time to wheel](https://preview.redd.it/8746byjkrab61.png?width=2760&format=png&auto=webp&s=c210980355934995c97ea8151066f07a9d449b48)\n\nAssigned on the first set of Puts. Fuck. Down 3-ish%. No worries, I'll collect more of that sweet premium w/ CCs at $10. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[MSFT News hits](https://preview.redd.it/8x1iv0kesab61.png?width=2760&format=png&auto=webp&s=791ec4aec2a3929bc6622a3427539f11c6a0c42a)\n\nMSFT news released. No real details. Some people are mocking it saying it is just an agreement to buy MSFT products. Yeah, that's one way to read it. (We're 3 months past this date and still don't know the specifics...). Missed a 40% jump that settled around 20%. The wheel gave me a 7% return instead. $30C bounced up. Continue to do option writing strategies (purchasing for CCs or near the money Puts). Unsure whether I'm being an idiot and should just go long, but things feel speculative and I like the idea of generating returns now (even lower) to buffer against the downside. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3jtvwmdgtab61.png?width=2760&format=png&auto=webp&s=be9dea874271eef7c638f105e7d4d85603836579\n\nWe rocket again! Can't even remember their being news. Shorts are getting squeezed for sure. I'm missing out.  I buy 1000 shares at $15.06. I kind of feel retarded so I hedge it by selling CCs against half the position. Weekly at first, but then $16C 6 weeks out. \n\n$30C still have massive bid/ask spreads but have gone up nicely (150%)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d11ov8twuab61.png?width=2760&format=png&auto=webp&s=c822ab096d7312bde938adfac6de41ed6ffe2b16\n\nJesus fucking Christ. So glad I sold those longer dated CC, but still took a bath. Really wondering if I'm just an idiot buying in at the top. I also really start considering longer dated $10 Puts (20% for 2 months was available), but pussy out. \n\nI dump the $30C as well on the way down ($1k profit off a $1k position)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d1lkmd59vab61.png?width=2760&format=png&auto=webp&s=123b123f3eecde3f236e7d29db7f716b1c65cc4a\n\nCohen sends a letter to the board. Market doesn't seem to care. The embarrassment of holding GameStop grows in me. I do a bit of buying to sell ATM CC's. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gwv65lwqvab61.png?width=2760&format=png&auto=webp&s=4bad068ef1a0d5780545dbc580737a45d774008e\n\nShit runs up again. Intense FOMO. Feeling like an idiot for not buying when things went back to \\~10. I'm doing the exact opposite of what you're supposed to do. A week ago I thought $GME was shit. Now I want to back up the truck... I held off buying at $13 (It'll pull back), $14, $15 (c'mon). I finally buy at 500 shares @ $16.01, 300 shares at $17.22, 700 more at $19.10. Watching this run up while holding a small position is ruining my Thanksgiving holiday...\n\nFeeling like a sucker I hedge w/ CC's. IV is thru the roof going into the Earnings call. I expect some detail on the MSFT deal. Hopefully the terms they got were good. Ideally they talk about similar deals w/ Sony and Nintendo (They got Reggie on the board, that's got to be a layup, right?). \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Sherman gives a terrible CC](https://preview.redd.it/o8xq3fmiwab61.png?width=2760&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d93203eea9a8e1a1ed17f6087cffaa7f22e3dd9)\n\nJesus.

How is this stock going to go up when the management has its head up its ass? I'm fucked. Holiday #s are the next big news item and these idiots will downplay them. Fuck.

He had a low enough cost basis to make a good profit.  He re-affirms and ups his share. \ud83d\ude80 back on the menu. Why don't I have more of this?

Would have been assigned at $18. Instead, I close the position for a small profit on the premium, don't want to up my $GME holdings. Already feels like too much exposure. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Yesterday](https://preview.redd.it/4x2txed31bb61.png?width=2760&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d3202709646cdffdf214d4747df21903d128db7)\n\nCohen and the board were added Monday. Mild move up (10%). TBH I'd barely processed that news when the 60%+ day occurred. \n\nI had 1500 shares w/ only 3 CC's written against them. Proceeded to sell CC's (8 contracts) at $25, $26, $29. I was expecting the move to stop at 15-30%. Obviously misjudged that but that's been my experience. I also really wanted to do the smart thing for once and take profits (relax, not selling shares, just writing contracts) on the upswing vs my normal retarded MO of buying high hoping to sell higher. \n\nWas eye-balling selling the $40C when it hit 600IV ($6 premium for 3 days...), but by that point I was so gunshy (every call I'd written to that point was blown by) and convinced this was going to infinity. I'm resisting the urge to buy, but its hard. Instead I sold some CCP's at $15k worth of $25 (4% return over 3 days). Those 1/15/21 $30C, even w/ massive theta decay, are selling for 3X what I got. \n\nAs confident as the market re-affirming my beliefs makes me $GME still isn't turning a profit yet. Details around the turnaround are scarce.

{"title": "Why AMD will easily break 100 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80", "selftext": "I don't know much, but I know tech and AMD has A LOT going for it right now.\n\n[*Obligatory do your own research and draw your own conclusions statement.*]\n\n**POSITIVES**\n\n- Both Sony and Microsoft are using custom AMD APUs in their latest consoles. (APU = CPU + GPU combined into one.) In case you've been living under a rock for the past 8 weeks, both the Playstation 5 and Xbox Series X have been selling like hotcakes, with fresh inventory being depleted within minutes. \n\n- AMD has been the underdog vs Intel in the consumer desktop CPU space for as long as I can remember. But for the first time in 15 years, [AMD is winning in terms of market share](https://www.techradar.com/news/amd-overtakes-intel-in-desktop-cpu-market-share-for-the-first-time-in-15-years). Intel has been able to stay competitive with their latest generation of CPUs by offering significant discounts. Despite this, AMD's CPUs still remain in higher demand and sell out almost instantly (at MSRP). \n\n- AMD owns Radeon, which is their brand of Graphics Cards. These compete directly with Nvidia's RTX GPUs. Performance wise, they're up there with NVDA, but still lagging a bit in the ray tracing department which most will agree is the future. Key word being future, it's not a big deal *yet*. And thanks to the pandemic these too also sell out super quick. \n\n- AMD's next generation of mobile CPUs will be launching soon. Just like their desktop lineup, you can expect these to outperform their Intel counterparts as well. AMD's previous mobile generation of 4000 series chips crushed Intel - the biggest problem was availability. People wanted the AMD chips but for whatever reason, they were found mostly in the mid-range and lower end gaming laptops. I expect the availability issue to improve greatly this year. As we can see, certain manufacturer's like Asus are already featuring the AMD SKUs in their [top of the line gaming laptops](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Asus-ROG-Strix-Scar-17-ditches-Comet-Lake-H-for-an-unlocked-Ryzen-9-5900HX-with-liquid-metal-and-RTX-3080-Mobile.514702.0.html). \n\n**RISK FACTORS**\n\n- While speaking purely from a monetary standpoint, overall I think the pandemic has been a net positive for tech companies like AMD. However, AMD's own fearless leader Lisa Su recently said: [\"...the COVID environment has increased shipping and freight costs, which are hard to avoid. As we get into a more normal environment, this should improve. This also matters for our planned graphics updates through the first half of the year, as we have a lot of product coming to market.\"](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16409/amd-ceo-dr-lisa-su-interview-on-2021-demand-supply-tariffs-xilinx-and-epyc)\n\n- Unable to keep up with demand: [AMD and NVIDIA confirm that GPU stock levels will remain non-existent for the foreseeable future](https://www.notebookcheck.net/AMD-and-NVIDIA-confirm-that-GPU-stock-levels-will-remain-non-existent-for-the-foreseeable-future.514957.0.html).\n[Microsoft has asked AMD for help in combating Xbox Series X stock shortages](https://www.techradar.com/news/microsoft-has-asked-amd-for-help-in-combating-xbox-series-x-stock-shortages)\n\n- Apple has already started producing their own in house ARM processors for both their laptops and desktops. This doesn't really affect AMD (yet) because [Apple has been using Intel chips in their laptops and desktops for the past 15 years.](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/10/why-apple-is-breaking-a-15-year-partnership-with-intel-on-its-macs-.html#:~:text=Menu-,Apple%20is%20breaking%20a%2015%2Dyear%20partnership%20with,on%20its%20Macs%20%E2%80%94%20here's%20why&text=Apple's%20new%20laptops%20and%20desktop,can%20improve%20laptop%20battery%20life.) And despite being a massive company, Apple only makes up about [13% of the PC market share](https://www.statista.com/statistics/576473/united-states-quarterly-pc-shipment-shareapple/#:~:text=In%20the%20fourth%20quarter%20of,the%20fourth%20quarter%20of%202020.). AMD is still Apple's partner for discrete graphics, but that could change soon. This is definitely something you'll want to keep your eye on though because other titans like [Microsoft](https://www.reuters.com/article/microsoft-processors-int/microsoft-working-on-in-house-chips-for-its-servers-pcs-idUSKBN28S2Y1), [Google](https://www.digitalinformationworld.com/2020/04/google-is-making-its-own-chips.html), and Amazon are all either working on, or producing their own in house chips. In my opinion, this is not nearly as bad as it sounds. Let's break it down by company.\n\n - [Microsoft currently uses Intel-based processors for the majority of its Azure cloud services, and most of the company\u2019s Surface lineup run on Intel chips, too.](https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22189450/microsoft-arm-processors-chips-servers-surface-report#:~:text=Microsoft%20has%20worked%20with%20AMD,move%20away%20from%20just%20Intel.&text=Microsoft%20co%2Dengineered%20an%20ARM,a%20couple%20of%20months%20ago.) Only some of Microsoft's laptops run on AMD hardware. \n\n - [Google is readying its own in-house processors for use in future Pixel devices, including both phones and eventually Chromebooks, too.](https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/14/google-said-to-be-preparing-its-own-chips-for-use-in-pixel-phones-and-chromebooks/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAADHPvna5MKFbSAnwNIPsW4kMhD7zhe-7IJtk0AzQP1Rrer78Olm_S_019orsNcQA9Ezk_sCz0z8My1nHGdTap_0-SYZtHKs1U9v9ni-AGkuJzp3cOHYUDSEu7b90qMQIDsc-PC8tFFceJElhUcPhJ3ctKtatuQcLkrIF1VotSBz1#:~:text=The%20Axios%20report%20says%20that,machine%20learning%20and%20Google%20Assistant.) Again, because Google currently relies more on Intel CPUs this is not a big blow to AMD's bottom line.

These were also replaced by Intel.\n\nAMD has earnings coming up on the 26th which I think they're going to shatter. I probably would not recommend trying to play off of that though as ERs can be quite unpredictable, especially if the news is positive. Personally, I think AMD is going to \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 after ER, but I'm not betting on that.
