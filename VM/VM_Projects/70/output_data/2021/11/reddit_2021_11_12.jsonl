But here\u2019s what I see:\n\n1) Social media has allowed information to travel amongst a lot of people in a short amount of time. I\u2019m sure this can be looked at both positively and negatively. Positively because quicker more readily available information makes the markets more efficient. Negatively because stocks tend to trade on momentum (FOMO) more than fundamentals. At some point, fundamentals will matter.\n\n2) The Fed monetary policy has drastically change over the past 20 years. Borrowing is essentially free, and in fact, if inflation keeps up at the 5 or 6% rate, in some instances you are being paid to borrow. Positive is that there\u2019s more money in circulation to spur economic growth. Negative is the possibility of a money bubble, runaway inflation, and/or in the event of another downturn (like Covid), the feds don\u2019t really have anymore levers to pull.\n\n3) $0 trades and trading apps like Robinhood have completely changed the game. These things gave access to individuals who would have previously been looked out. Positive is there\u2019s more people to invest their money (increase money supply) which in turn increases prices. Negative is stocks no longer trade on historical multiples, potentially inflating the cash bubble, and/or inexperience investing leading to bubbles.\n\n4) Generational wealth changing hands. The silent and boomer generation are starting to die off, and the boomer generations as a whole holds the bulk of the wealth. As they die, their heirs will inherit vasts amounts of wealth (unless the government taxes it all away). Their heirs are likely to spend that money and invest it differently. Younger generations tend to be less risk adverse, which could explain why some much money is going into things like NFTs, crypo, tech stocks, and so on. Positive is alternative investment strategies are being taken seriously, but the negative is a lot of risky speculation can lead to a major market crash.\n\n5) Margin accounts have increase over the last 20 years. More people have entered the market and leverage has been increasing. Positive is the increased money supply which increases stock prices, but the negative is potentially inflating the money bubble.\n\nI\u2019m sure I\u2019m missing some things and not totally correct on the above, but I\u2019m not trying to turn a comment into a PhD thesis on Reddit. I think the biggest risk to the market right now is a money bubble. There\u2019s too much capital seeking investment worthy places to go. The problem is there\u2019s just not that many good investments out there (historically speaking).

The ones still standing have cut back primary reporting as they struggle against social media, click bait, and infotainment.

But what is really weird is things have become much worse despite usage of the web growing immensely and technology improving.  The best discussion boards about stocks twenty years ago were those of the Motley Fool.  It had a board for every stock.  They used paid moderators.  They had discussions that were on a far higher level than what is found on Reddit.  Some of that probably had to do with its user base being white collar workers with substantial money on the line.  The dot-com crash devastated advertising rates, so the Fool was forced to lay off a lot of its staff.  Eventually it tried to monetize its boards by charging a fee.  That did not work out, the boards became a ghost town, and the Fool then switched its business model to selling news letters.

{"title": "$GOEV - Canoo Earnings Report Speculation", "selftext": "**I'ma try an' keep this short an' sweet.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not gonna go in-depth about Canoo as a company. If you're on WSB then you've probably heard of Canoo. Regardless we all just throw money around any way, so fuck it, if you really give a shit then do some research.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo cut to the chase, Canoo is having its' Earnings Report next Monday (11/15/2021). Because Canoo is a newer EV company they obviously don't have any true earnings to announce. The idea is that Tony Aquila (CEO of Canoo) will use this call to drop some good news. But will he drop news? and if so, what?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**That's where the true speculation begins.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA lot of information has been leaked that Tony Tequila has not commented on or has barely acknowledged and is not priced-in. The next logical thought process is; What information does Tony Tequila have that hasn't been leaked yet? Will Tony Tequila comment on any of the leaked information or release any new information?\n\nWell, what I'm saying, is that there are known-knowns and that there are known-unknowns. But there's also unknown-unknowns; things we don't know that we don't [know.](https://youtu.be/2msQwpzatQc?t=23)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Here's some known-knowns that hasn't received a lot of press and has barely moved the stock price:**\n\n\\- Canoo announcing battery supply agreement with Panasonic\n\n\\- Canoo's attendance of the Certified Pest Control Operators of Georgia's 23rd annual conference\n\n\\- An insane amount of new hires including people from Nio, Tesla, Harley Davidson, etc.\n\n\\- Canoo partnership with VDL Nedcar to manufacture vehicles\n\n\\- Canoo's MPDV nominated for Red Dot Design Award\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Here's some of the known-unknowns that Canoo hasn't commented on or has barely acknowledged:**\n\n\\- Pictures of the new sedan (leaked, unannounced)\n\n\\- Frontdoor Collective ordering 10,000 delivery vans by 2024 from Canoo (barely acknowledged, hardly any press)\n\n\\- [AirAsia](https://i.imgur.com/WpY2qVX.png) partnering with Canoo for its' new rideshare program (YouTube video uploaded by AirAsia then made private soon after)\n\n\\-Tony Aquila's Form 4 showing him become a majority shareholder in the company\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Unkown-unkowns?**\n\n\\- Who the fuck does know. Looking at the past knowns, it could be anything (Canoo-Apple partnership? /s)\n\nThe obvious idea behind unknown-unknowns is that Tony \"butt fuck\" Tequila could release information that hasn't been leaked that no one knows of.\n\n**A little bonus spice:**\n\nNow I want to make it clear that this is mostly an earnings play.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut I can't leave out the the insane volume of open interest for the 11/19 calls. Currently there are 56,598 options that are currently OTM. 17,069 of them are for the $10 strike. Current stock price as of writing this is is around $8.50. If the 10 strike calls get close to being ITM then GOEV could go parabolic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI want to reiterate, this is not a GME type fresh orange juice play, this is speculation on the Earnings Report being received well by the market. But the fact that OTM OI is so high, could help this stock fly. Just an added bonus.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nCanoo ($GOEV) will release some big news that makes the market excited for the company. When big news then big moves. High OI make stock fly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI will add links for proof to the above claims in a comment below. Auto-mod is a bitch.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Position:** [1,500 11/19 15c](https://i.imgur.com/vLgP9c6.jpg)", "id": "qs0l9c", "created_utc": 1636681926.0, "score": 133, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 72, "comments": [{"body": "Last year everything was so exciting about Canoo.

Pennies a share for contracts.  If the play comes through the returns will be silly.\n\nEdit: the earnings call is after market close on Monday, so we can still try this play, if you are reading over the weekend.\n\nEdit 2: at time of writing, shares are 8.59, 7c are 1.75, 7.50c are 1.30, and 8c are 0.95.  These are basically at the share price already, it seems like a pretty low risk play to leverage potential one-day gains.   (I mean I guess it could drop to 6.50 again, but the risk seems asymmetrical to me)\n\nEdit 3: I decided to evaluate OPs claims about the number of outstanding contracts and he's right.  If it closes at current prices, about 1M shares need to be delivered.  At $9, 1.2M; at $10 2.8M, at $11.50 3M, at $12.50 4.1M, and at $15 5.1M shares.  This would eat right through the bid ask spread and could send things parabolic.\n\nEdit 3B: Also worth nothing is the amount of short interest on the stock which has been *very high* since June (https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/goev/short-interest).  Tracking the shorts, the only times the outstanding interest has had a noticeable number of closed positions, the share price is driven up.  (Key periods: Sep 15-30, Aug 13-31, May 28-Jun 15).  It seems like, when 800,000 shorts or more want to close their position, the stock will spike.\n\nEdit 3C: I am making my own WSB post tomorrow after entering a position this is the real deal I think.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Did you post?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "This is reddit you can just look at my profile.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Picked the dick route.
