Facebook is still the most used social network in the world, by far. And 4 out of the top 5 social networks are owned by the parent company Meta. (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMonth over month Facebook user growth has slowed, but not for the reasons you may think. Facebook had 3 billion active users this month, there are only 5 billion people in the world with smart phones. It's mathematically impossible for Facebook to 2x its users. So on paper it looks like stagnation, but it's really just max penetration of the market.\n\nFor us shareholders, we like to price in future growth, so stagnation isn't exactly the word we want to hear. Mark Zuckerberg is a smart cookie, he understands that they are hitting the literal ceiling of growth within their current business model. That's why investors should be applauding their pivot into the \"Metaverse\". If their Metaverse venture is successful, Facebook will reward investors with so much   new growth.
