{"title": "Tesla = Apple x 10", "selftext": "Tesla's core consumer business today has fundamentals like Apple except with comparatively gigantic total addressable market.\n\n*Rough Math*\n\nOver the next 40 years, Apple sells people on average $1k worth of consumer electronics products and services every two years for a cumulative average revenue per customer of $20k.\n\n30% net margins on that $20k.\n\nNet present value of after-tax earnings per customer: About $3k\n\nTotal customer base over that time: 1.3 billion people (it's about 1 billion today)\n\nTotal net present value of earnings: $4T\n\nOver the next 40 years, Tesla sells each customer on average a cumulative total of $150k worth of vehicles, software upgrades, charging, Powerwalls, solar panels/roofs, and insurance. This is accounting for the average where not everyone buys all the products; a super fan who buys four or five Tesla vehicles and one of everything else might have their total tab adding up to $300k+ over four decades.\n\n30% net margins on that $150k.\n\nNet present value of after-tax earnings per customer: About $15k  (time-value discount is higher than for Apple bc Tesla still needs time to scale) \n\nTotal customer base over that time: 0.5 billion people (For reference, this is about equal to the adult population of Europe, but with sales spread out globally. Demographers expect global population to peak around 10 billion by 2035 or so.) \n\nTotal net present value of earnings:  $7.5T\n\nDouble Apple's worth based on what I think are pretty conservative assumptions for Tesla.\n\nBut wait, there's more. The preceding was just Tesla's consumer business. With TSLA ownership we also get fleet sales and a stake in a host of other potential big winners:\n\nComputer Vision lottery tickets (FSD & TeslaBot)\n\nMegapack\n\nVirtual Powerplants\n\nBoring Co synergies\n\nDojo SaaS (Software as a Service)\n\nElectric Vertical Take Off and Landing aircraft (or at least supplying EVTOL makers with batteries, motors, power electronics, and battery management software)\n\nHVAC (Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning)\n\nUnannounced new products (they have a trend of surprising us with major new business lines every couple years, and this will probably continue because of their leadership and culture)\n\nPeople say this is just a cult. Guess what: I agree; it is a cult.\n\nBut it's not *just* a cult; it's also going to be the most profitable enterprise in the history of capitalism thus far. This is unprecedented, and right now you can buy in while the market cap is only $1T.\n\nThis is not financial advice.\n\nEdit: on deeper look, $120k rev per average customer is more realistic. See comments below for a breakdown of revenue expectations. $150k was a rough estimate from this different way of looking at the valuation. This changes the number from $7.5T to $6T. To reiterate, this is only valuing the consumer products side of the business to compare with Apple, and doesn't account for any profits beyond 40 years out.\n\nEdit 2: Also, bear in mind that the 500 million Tesla customers estimate does not include fleet purchases of the single motor cybertruck, van, and Semi truck, nor the many millions of less wealthy customers who will buy cheaper less fancy Tesla products such as a $20-25k economy cars.", "id": "qtbi9l", "created_utc": 1636841855.0, "score": 154, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 71, "comments": [{"body": "I would like to see you spreadsheet.

This will allow customers to use their EV car batteries as their power wall, meaning you can use your car to power your home (like the Ford Lightening is promoting), but it will also interface seamlessly with the grid.\n\nIf you are a senior, or work from home, and have your idle Tesla garaged, you will be able to leave it plugged in, fully charge it at night (at a lower rate) and sell the electricity back to the grid during peak demand (at a higher rate), preserving what you might need to drive later. This will allow Tesla to create their own utility managing this power supply, and you will get the benefit of automatic backup for your home office from your car.\n\nA Tesla Powerwall can provide 13.5KW of storage, EV batteries hold up to 4-5x that capacity. Either way, a Powerwall or your cars battery storage can help to pay for itself, which is a plus.\n\nWhen Tesla links all of these participating plugged in EV\u2019s (with or without an additional Powerwall and/or home solar) to the grid, it will create a huge new green energy Tesla utility that is somewhat climate change disaster proof, since it is spread out rather than centralized. The ability of Tesla to manage this instantaneously available power supply means that legacy utility companies won\u2019t have to fire up an idle gas/coal/oil fired generating plant to prevent brownouts.\n\nWith FSD and robo-taxis, as individual ownership of cars declines, many people will then revert to powerwalls for their backup storage, still using the Tesla interface to the grid.\n\nEven without home solar, the ability to charge your pack at low demand times cheaply and resell back during peak demand will generate income (for both Tesla and the homeowner) and thus reduce the cost of a Powerwall or Tesla solar installation for the consumer.\n\nThis will put emergency backup generators (like the home and business installation of natural gas/diesel Generac generators) out of business, since the maintenance is horrible, and their efficiency isn\u2019t as good, and they also are polluting like an ICE car, but worse. They are also quite expensive, and unnecessary if you can use the EV parked in your garage instead. In any case, these small inefficient, dirty and expensive back up generators cannot instantly interface with the grid like the Tesla utility can and likely will do.\n\nI am betting big on Tesla, more so when I learned about the possibility of the above interface between the auto and clean energy divisions. This is also why when I buy a Tesla, I want the new/old tech LFP batteries, as they will be better for this constant cycling to and from the grid (until a better battery storage technology comes along).\n\nWith the potential of FSD enabling future robots-taxi's, Tesla can also take advantage of the SpaceX satellite network, meaning a Tesla driving on autopilot will be able to communicate with other Tesla autopilot driven vehicles, avoiding crashes and improving the efficiency of that service.\n\nAs it becomes less expense to operate robotaxis (insurance/energy waste), there will be even lower cost for consumers. This will speed adoption of TAS and put Lyft and Uber out of business, reducing individual ownership of cars (it will be cheaper to just hail and ride, even if you are going from Houston to Miami). Buying a Tesla gives you some future proofing, as it will be able to adopt the most recent FSD updates, perhaps even allowing owners in the future to become virtual Uber drivers, sending their car out and splitting the revenue with Tesla for your driverless taxi service participation.\n\nTesla having this sort of planet-wide communication network, along with having accumulated the most data from cars on the road to enhance their autopilot, means any competitors with cheaper EV's will probably have to license Tesla autopilot for their cars, and other systems like Waymo probably won\u2019t win the race to autonomous driving (though Google is trying, and Apple is thinking about it)\n\nAnother note about FSD relates to car insurance. Tesla is launching their own car insurance. Since seat-of-the-pants actuarial science tells me that many human drivers on the roads around me are actually horrible at driving, eventually it will be much cheaper to insure an autopilot driven taxi than a person driving their own car, this will also expand the cost gap between driving yourself and hailing a convenient Tesla auto taxi.\n\nBTW there are good autopilot systems being developed in China, however some of them use infrastructure placements on roads to help the cars navigate, Tesla's infrastructure for this will already exist in space , meaning they don\u2019t have to do what these Chinese manufacturers are attempting and blanket every road with hard infrastructure.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "EVs are a big part of the solution to the intermittency of renewables.
