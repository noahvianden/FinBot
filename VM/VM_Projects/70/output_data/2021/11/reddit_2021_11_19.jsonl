{"title": "The Beauty of the Gamma Squeeze - Gamma Squeezes Explained", "selftext": "Hey all, hope you\u2019re doing well! Today, I\u2019m going to be delivering a short writeup on a fun little market phenomenon known as the Gamma Squeeze. I\u2019ll be breaking it down into three sections to try making it as digestible as possible allowing everyone to easily follow along. To those looking for a more in-depth explanation with visual examples, feel free to check out the video I made on the topic **[here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYvMZ9JHx4c)** Let's get into it!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Overview of the Gamma Squeeze\nIn short, a gamma squeeze is the phenomenon that occurs when a stock has extremely high open interest on its options chain, and the price of the underlying rises suddenly. This sudden rise in price causes the delta on the open options contracts to rapidly increase, forcing market makers to buy extra shares to keep their open positions delta neutral. If enough contracts are open, when the market makers buy extra stock to stay delta neutral, they will cause the price of the underlying to increase, thereby causing the delta on the contracts to increase AGAIN, thereby forcing themselves to buy more shares to remain delta neutral. Rinse and repeat. Let\u2019s break it all down!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#What Exactly Happens When You Buy a Call Option?\n\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019re extremely bullish on stock $ABC. You decide to buy an out of the money call option on $ABC instead of the underlying shares for extra leverage. You are now ***delta positive***, meaning you profit if $ABC rises in value. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nOn the flipside of the trade, you\u2019ve got the market maker who sold you the option, who is now ***delta negative***. He will now lose money if $ABC rises in value. **The market maker does not want this.** His job is to provide liquidity to the markets, and he makes his profits through the bid-ask spread. Him being delta negative or delta positive can cause him to incur serious losses, therefore he makes a large effort to remain delta neutral. The market maker can become delta neutral by buying shares of $ABC equal to the **delta** on the contract he just sold.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf the delta on the contract is 0.15, he will hedge the call he sold by buying 15 shares of $ABC. If it\u2019s 0.43, he will buy 43 shares, etc. This relationship is dynamic, meaning that **the market maker will buy or sell shares to match the delta on the contracts as it changes as a result of the price of the underlying changing.** If the price of $ABC rises, the delta on the call options will also increase, causing the market maker to buy more shares in order to keep his position hedged. If the price of $ABC falls, the delta will decrease, and the market maker will sell some of his shares as he no longer needs them to stay properly hedged.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe key takeaway from this section is that a market maker will almost always be on the flipside of your trade, and that market makers will ***always*** aim to be delta neutral by hedging their positions (most often with shares) so they can always make profits, regardless of a stock's movement. The market makers job is to provide liquidity to the markets, and they make all of their money through the bid-ask spreads.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#The Effect of Call Buying on the Markets\n\nNormally, this unique relationship between call-buyer and market maker rarely has an effect on the price of the underlying since people generally don\u2019t buy large volumes of out of the money options contracts. Even if volume is high, **the delta on out of the money options contracts is low, meaning that market makers aren't forced to buy many shares to remain delta neutral.** This is further mediated by the fact that the change in delta relative to the price of the underlying, measured by gamma, will also be extremely low, meaning that even if the underlying does move up in price, delta won\u2019t increase much, meaning that the market maker won\u2019t have to buy many more extra shares to remain hedged. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nTo illustrate my point, let\u2019s say that my buddy Jim is extremely bullish on $ABC and wishes to capitalize on his thesis by buying out of the money options. **If Jim slams 100 OTM contracts on $ABC with a delta of 0.15, he\u2019ll force a market maker to purchase 1500 shares of $ABC.** Initially, that may seem like a lot, but you need to consider that most tickers have *millions to billions* of shares out on the open market, so those 1500 shares are just a drop in the bucket. Even if Jim had a good read, and the OTM call options end up being ITM by expiration giving them a delta of 1.00, they will still only control 10,000 shares of the underlying, likely not moving the price much, if at all.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe key takeaway from this section is that volume, delta, and gamma all work together to keep things from getting out of hand. If either one of these variables is low, it suppresses the other two and keeps things in check. So what gives? How is it even possible for a Gamma Squeeze to occur?\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#The Criteria Necessary for a Gamma Squeeze\n\nIn order for a gamma squeeze to occur, you need lots of gamma, of course! But how is this accomplished? As dumb as it sounds, all you *technically* need is volume. A lot of it. A catalyst also helps too, no matter how small. Let\u2019s revisit our example from above.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nLet\u2019s say that alongside Jim, we had 1000 other people buying 100 of the exact same 0.15 delta OTM contract. We\u2019ve now forced a market maker to buy 1,500,000 shares of $ABC just to remain delta neutral. This ***definitely*** moved the price of the underlying, even if it was just a little. Depending on the magnitude of the move, this could\u2019ve even caused the delta of these contracts to go up, meaning that the market maker would need to buy even more shares on top of the 1.5 million he\u2019s already picked up just to stay hedged.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nLet\u2019s say that a small catalyst hits, and the underlying organically jumps in price. The delta on the $ABC options would also jump up, meaning the market maker will be forced to buy even more shares. For example, if the delta on the contracts goes up to 0.35, the market maker will have to buy an additional 2,000,000 shares just to remain hedged, bringing up his entire position to 3,500,000 shares of $ABC.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe purchase of these 2,000,000 additional shares would undoubtedly affect the price of the underlying at this point, meaning that after the market maker buys his shares to hedge, the delta on the contracts he just hedged would\u2019ve gone up. He then has to buy even more shares to hedge, so he does, causing the delta to go up again, causing him to have to buy more shares to hedge, etc, until we ultimately reach a point of equilibrium and end up with a highly inflated stock price.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***The situation above can also occur even with the absence of a catalyst, given that there is enough degeneracy.***\n\n&nbsp;\n\nLet\u2019s recycle the same situation with Jim and his 1000 buddies. They buy 100 0.15 delta OTM contracts each and force a market maker to buy 1,500,000 contracts, causing a small bump in the underlying price. Other people then see the underlying starting to rise, and then they decide to buy some OTM options as well. We\u2019ve now got 500 extra people slamming 100 of those options, forcing the market maker to buy an additional 750,000 shares. This causes the underlying to rise, as well as the delta on everyone's contracts to go up to 0.2, meaning the market maker buys some extra shares to remain delta neutral. The market maker is now in possession of 3,000,000 shares. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe price is starting to inflate, so naturally people slam some more OTM options. Another 500 people join the party, forcing the market maker to buy even more shares to stay hedged, driving both price and delta even higher. **Like a dog chasing his tail, the market maker is forced to buy shares to match the delta on his contracts, only for the delta to increase as a result of him buying shares,** ultimately reaching a point of equilibrium alongside an inflated stock price.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThese situations are purely hypothetical, and are aimed to illustrate that although ***no two gamma squeezes are the same***, they all ultimately occur due to a rapid change in delta as a byproduct of high volume. Once the change in delta becomes high enough, a situation similar to the ones above is inevitable. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe key takeaway from this convoluted section is that high volumes of call buying causes an underlyings price to increase alongside delta, and the rate at which delta increases is amplified the closer we get to being ITM on our OTM contracts. These moves start slow, but ramp extremely quickly causing explosive moves to the upside as the change in delta rapidly increases. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Conclusion\n\nAlthough gamma squeezes are complex beasts, I hope I managed to shed some light on some of the underlying mechanics at play to give you all a deeper understanding of what\u2019s going on!

Many of these mega tech companies can go from PE ratios of 100 to 1 within one quarter if they stop investing completely in R&D and Marketing. Zero expenses in anything but COGS, and boom, you have an instantly super profitable company.\n\nSo take a look at their balance sheet as listed on their Q3 results: https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-third-quarter-fiscal-2022\n\nEarnings for Q3 were 0.99/share, with the year end target of $3.50/share. So yes, PE of 100.\n\nBut look at where their expenses are. For the training 9 months, revenue of 19.2Bn, COGS of 6.7Bn. So gross margin of 76%. Then they have Operating Expenses of 5.4Bn. Let's break that down and say that NVDA stops completely investing in R&D and marketing, and slashes those costs by 80%. That means their operating expenses would fall to $1.1Bn.\n\nThat would boost their net income to $11.3Bn for the last 12 months, and give them an EPS of $4.54/share, and set them on track for a CY2021 EPS of $6.05. Now their PE ratio is 50. But that would be a one time thing, and without that R&D investment you can assume that NVDA won't remain competitive in their high tech field.\n\n\nLet's ask this another way. In September 2020, when MSFT was $225/share at mkt cap of 1.5T, would you have said \"that's overvalued\"? The secret to these mega tech companies that are executing well is that the create new markets and dominate them. How do you value a brand new market that doesn't exist yet? For NVDA, the bet is on AI. AI in research, AI in basic commercial consumer interactions, AI in professional visualization, AI everywhere. And this is the tip of the iceberg for such a huge market.\n\nIf you have 10 year time horizons, trying to look at current PE ratios to decide to invest in a company that's executing well is too myopic. I would instead try to understand whether you believe in that company to execute and grow new markets and new revenue streams to justify their existence.\n\n\nAlso, don't forget that the secondary stock market is all about supply/demand.

The problem here is getting it at an acceptable price.

So yes, past studies of financial ratios indeed give you a good idea of what to expect, but when companies create markets out of nothing, sometimes they are able to blow past any prior expectations.\n\nIt is very difficult to value things which do not currently exist yet, I don't know what is the market for the metaverse for example, nor can I evaluate accurately what is the TAM of Tesla's FSD. I can only guesstimate what the potential of these things are, and the reactions of the investors when certain things have been announced.\n\nJust be mindful that financial ratios are more backwards looking than they are forward looking, it is a useful matric to look at but you should understand what these ratios can and cannot tell you. PE ratios cannot tell you when a tech company will release the next big thing, and fundamental change the company's outlook.\n\nSomeone who followed AMD news/technical reviews closely might have a hint of when Ryzen is coming back in 2017, yet someone who studies the ratios won't ever see it coming.\n\nSomeone who chooses NVDA over current offerings place a higher value on the company's technological prowess as opposed to their financials, they probably taken financials into consideration and judged that what NVDA is doing is worth the extra premium.", "score": 37, "replies": [{"body": "Good read.

{"title": "The core reason why no one will ever catch Tesla", "selftext": "\nTLDR; watch [this video](https://youtu.be/6edPaRGyHIQ) (ignore the clickbait title). It will change the way you think about Tesla as a company. \n\nSo I\u2019ve been a Tesla bull since about 2015 when a coworker of mine took me for a ride in his Model S 75D. It was clear to me then that there no other car on the road like it and that Tesla would be the iPhone of the car industry. However, it wasn\u2019t until 2019 that I started to follow the company more regularly and it wasn\u2019t until 2020 that I started to follow the company aggressively. For about the last two years now I have followed Tesla on a daily basis and have followed this subreddit heavily (thank you to all you wonderful contributors).\n\nSo why does that matter and where am I going with it?\n\nAs I\u2019ve said, I\u2019ve been a bull for a while and I believe that long term Tesla will do great things. I\u2019ve watched many videos and read many posts that have given me new insight to strengthen my conviction. But this week, I stumbled on the [Joe Justice interview](https://youtu.be/6edPaRGyHIQ) and the content in that video has completely solidified my outlook on Tesla, more than any other information I\u2019ve consumed before it. \n\nWhy?\n\nBefore we get into that a little about me\u2026 I\u2019ve been working at a FAANG company for about 7 years now. I work on hardware products that are household names, I would bet that many of you own products I have personally worked on. I have extensive experience with what it takes to build hardware, how products are typically built and how tech companies are generally organized. Additionally, I have friends or ex-colleagues across pretty much every FAANG company, so I have some insight into how the wider tech industry functions. \n\nSo why does my experience matter in any way?\n\nWell, in the interview, Joe discusses how Tesla is structured and how employees are treated and motivated. And let me tell you that what I heard absolutely blew my mind. If that video is accurate, Tesla is structured in a way that is unlike any tech company (actually any company) that I\u2019m familiar with. And not just a little bit, but radically different. These differences matter.\n\n1. Tesla doesn\u2019t have a traditional management structure\n\nDesign/Engineerjng Management exists to keep people motivated, organized and to provide feedback that what the employee is working on is beneficial to the company and aligned with the goals. Management is a universal business concept and is the norm. I\u2019ve seen flat companies before, but it\u2019s almost always at startups. Usually hierarchy is established as the company grows since its very difficult to scale without it. Tesla on the other hand does not have a management structure at scale! This is incredibly important as hierarchy tends to slow things down through the process of information filtering downward/upward through multiple chains of people. In fact where I work, I can\u2019t really talk to our SVP unless I go through the management chain. I\u2019ve seen people try to do it and they get reprimanded for not following the chain. Which brings me to the next point.\n\n2. Anyone can talk directly to Elon Musk and if someone tries to block you, they are fired. \n\nAs I just mentioned, management chains and information hierarchy slow a company down. Additionally, information tends to be filtered as it moves, because people in the middle try to \u201cmanage the message\u201d as to not upset those above them or keep those below them motivated. This means that leadership tends to get a watered down story of any particular problem. What this leaves us with is a leadership team that lives in a completely different reality than what is actually happening on the ground. This wreaks havoc on productivity and timelines as leadership and contributors are completely misaligned. At Tesla, anyone can talk to Elon\u2026anyone. This ensures that there is no information filtering and that the highest leadership has a true understanding of what is actually happening. And for Tesla to say that if someone tries to block you, they\u2019re fired is very important as a company tends to be a representation of who they \u201chire and fire\u201d. By setting this precedent, Tesla is ensuring that personality types who like to try to \u201cmanage the message\u201d or play politics are not welcome at Tesla. \n\n3. Employees self organize around solving problems.\n\nSo as some of you might wonder, how do you run a company without a hierarchical structure? As I mentioned, companies attempt this all the time and most end up abandoning it as they scale up. The most common way I\u2019ve seen it attempted is similar to the way Tesla is approaching it. They simply encourage their employees to be miniature entrepreneurs and self organize around idea that the employees are passionate about. Passionate employees are extremely valuable to the company as they will be extremely productive and are likely to pursue novel ideas born from this passion. This is what you want in a company. You want your employees to believe in the mission, put all their energy into solving problems and coming up with innovative solutions to them. Tesla has structured the company in a way to optimize those attributes and have managed to keep this structure even as they\u2019ve grown. That is an incredible accomplishment. \n\n\n3. Employees are paid a similar base salary and are given equity and access to acquire equity. \n\nIn addition to motivating people around a mission and ideas, a job is a job, so there is always a monetary aspect. Pretty much all big tech companies give their employees compensation comprised of three components: base salary, bonus and equity. At lower levels, the majority of the salary comes from base and bonus, but as you increase levels more of your salary tends to come from equity. For example, my salary is about 40% equity and 60% base/bonus. This encourages those who are higher up to stay at the company as they are more directly tied to its success. But as I\u2019ve discussed before, motivating those at the top is not always the best idea as they aren\u2019t the ones actually doing the work and these people have a tendency to actually slow a company down. On the other hand, the contributors actually doing the work are less motivated to ground work and more motivated to climb their corporate ladder as that is how their compensation will increase. Tesla on the other hand pays all of their employees close to the same base salary and they are all given stock. Every single employee. And in addition, they are given access to buy stock at hefty discounts. So we tie the mission and passion to a salary based heavily on equity and you end up with employees who are highly motivated to increase the stock price. This is incredible!\n\nSo what does this organizational structure get you?\n\nWell, one example that Joe gives is around getting the cars to accept 250kw charging from 200kw (a feature that increased the stock price). That idea went from concept to production in three hours. Yes, that wasn\u2019t a typo\u2026three hours. In that insanely short span of time the idea was generated, tested and implemented into vehicle production. A change of that magnitude in even the best of the tech industry would take weeks to months at best. This is absolutely incredible! \n\n\nThis to me is the true genius of Tesla. After all, a company is just a group of people aligned around a central mission and Tesla has managed to use first principles thinking all the way down to the way the company is organized. To me, no one will ever catch them using a traditional organization structure, it\u2019s just too slow and cumbersome in comparison. Additionally, organizing a company in the same way would be incredibly difficult for anyone and near impossible for those with bloated, but well established structures.\n\nAs long as Tesla remains this way they will out innovate everyone as you can\u2019t beat a company of passionate and smart people aligned around a singular mission in an organization designed from the ground up to support those goals. \n\nTesla is king!\n\n\nThere are a few other key points I didn\u2019t mention as this post could easily double in size from where it is today. I highly encourage everyone to watch that video. And I\u2019d love to hear from others in the industry what they think of Tesla\u2019s structure and how it differs or is similar to the structure they work in.", "id": "qxk9h6", "created_utc": 1637340598.0, "score": 162, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 72, "comments": [{"body": "I worked at Tesla for 4 years.

I had probably the least structured role of anyone I knew, my boss let me do whatever about 90% of the time while I would be basically loaned off to different directors to solve the problem that was most urgent. But there I still had a boss, there was still responsibility and there was always accountability. Always. And I still had a boss.\n\nI left because I was overseas and they wanted to correct my contract. The issue was I was being paid way more than others in my title (I was worth it). My salary was not similar to others. I know some people who earn a base salary over $200k and some who are down around $40k.\n\nAlso, I had multiple times where I did reach out to others in executive positions and got \u201creprimanded\u201d. One was a president who I sent some notes to and I got a light conversation with a list of some consequences that came out of it (a few questions only, I didn\u2019t see the problem but he was worried about it). And another, in Europe, where the director of hr very clearly threatened me, and I threatened back about reporting it to Elon which shut her up.\n\nBut she felt comfortable doing this, and I think it was clear she had done this before.

Tesla has a flat culture in terms of communication such as speaking up about things outside your responsibility or jumping hierarchy to raise/discuss issues, but they don't have flat structure of accountability. *Machine Learning* bullshit won't work there.

Tesla puts hardware in production before validating the real world safety and upgrading the charging capability, but it doesn't go from idea to production so quickly.\n\nHe also exaggerates how cross-pollination works among Elon's companies.

You can see similar cultures in tech companies like Facebook and Nvidia. It was definitely radical to create that culture in the manufacturing domain. The Anti-handbook handbook is more revealing than all that hyperbole from Joe Justice. Joe is just name dropping Tesla and Elon without any meaningful insights.\n\nRemember Elon's quote form the AI day\n\n>**Unless you have to use machine learning don't do,** **It's usually a red flag when somebody says we want to use machine learning to solve this task, i'm like that sounds like** ***bullshit***\n\nEdit: a word", "score": 47, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you for the thoughtful reply, it\u2019s refreshing to engage in meaningful discussion about the company.\n\nI\u2019m with you 100% and I don\u2019t really buy the whole ML makes decisions for everything either.\n\nAlso, yes his valuation made zero sense to me.
