{"title": "Fed to begin taper later this month", "selftext": "Source:\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/fed-chairman-powells-odds-at-confirmation-complicated-by-trading-scandal-180153752.html\n\n\n\nThe Federal Reserve on Wednesday said it would start slowing its pace of asset purchases, the first step in paring back its COVID-era easy money policies.\n\u201cIn light of the substantial further progress the economy has made toward the committee\u2019s goals since last December, the Committee decided to begin reducing the monthly pace of its net asset purchases,\u201d the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee said in its updated policy statement Wednesday.\nSince the depths of the pandemic, the central bank has been directly buying U.S. Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities to signal its support of the economic recovery. As of now, the Fed is pacing its purchases at a clip of about $120 billion per month.\n\n\nBut the Fed said Wednesday it will gradually slow the pace of those purchases by about $15 billion per month, as part of a plan to bring its so-called quantitative easing program to a full stop by the middle of next year. The taper will begin \u201clater this month\u201d and will continue at that $15 billion pace through December, although the FOMC clarified it could change the pace of taper as needed.\n\n\nThe Committee judges that similar reductions in the pace of net asset purchases will likely be appropriate each month, but it is prepared to adjust the pace of purchases if warranted by changes in the economic outlook,\u201d the FOMC statement reads.\nThe FOMC still maintained short-term interest rates at near zero. The decision on rates and taper was unanimous.\nThe Fed statement continued to double down on its view that high inflation readings will prove to be \u201ctransitory,\u201d noting that \u201csupply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy have contributed to sizable price increases in some sectors.\u201d\nAnticipation for a Fed taper has ramped up discussion over the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s next steps: raising interest rates.\nFed officials have made it clear that the timing of taper has no direct implications for the timing of raising short-term borrowing costs from the current setting of near zero.\n\n\nBut markets appear to be getting ahead of the Fed. As Powell and other Fed officials all but signaled that taper was coming, bets on interest rates reflected expectations for a more hawkish cycle of Fed rate hikes through 2022.\n\n\n\nHeaded into Wednesday afternoon\u2019s announcement, Fed funds futures contracts priced in a strong chance that the central bank will have hiked rates at least three times by the end of 2022. Those expectations ratcheted up in the four weeks leading up to the Fed\u2019s taper announcement.\nThe central bank\u2019s next policy-setting announcement is scheduled to take place Dec. 14 and 15.\nStill, Fed officials have emphasized the need to close the jobs shortfall of 5 million workers (compared to pre-pandemic levels), policymakers have insisted that near-zero interest rates should still support employment as it tapers.\n\u201cI do think it\u2019s time to taper, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s time to raise rates,\u201d said Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Oct. 22.\nIn his press conference, Powell could field questions about whether or not the Fed's tapering plans are connected to future interest rate hikes. But Powell will also likely face questions regarding the central bank's ongoing trading scandal, as well as Powell's own updates on whether or not he's in consideration for another term as Fed chairman.", "id": "qm2ym7", "created_utc": 1635969971.0, "score": 207, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 77, "comments": [{"body": "And just as everybody predicted: S&P hits record high.
