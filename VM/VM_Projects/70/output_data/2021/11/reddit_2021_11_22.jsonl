Data is today\u2019s new business currency, and memory and storage are strategic differentiators which will redefine how we extract value from data to expand the global economy and transform our society.*\n\n*As the leader in innovative memory solutions, Micron is helping the world make sense of data by delivering technology that is transforming how the world uses information to enrich life for all. Through our global brands \u2014 Micron and Crucial \u2014 we offer the industry\u2019s broadest portfolio. We are the only company manufacturing today\u2019s major memory and storage technologies: DRAM, NAND, and NOR technology.*\n\n*By providing foundational capability for innovations like AI and 5G across data center, the intelligent edge, and consumer devices, we unlock innovation across industries including healthcare, automotive and communications. Our technology and expertise are central to maximizing value from cutting-edge computing applications and new business models which disrupt and advance the industry.*\n\n*From our roots in Boise, Idaho, Micron has grown into an influential global presence committed to being the best memory company in the world. This means conducting business with integrity, accountability, and professionalism and supporting our global community.\u201d*\n(https://www.micron.com/about/our-company/corporate-profile)\n\n**Introduction:**\n\n[MU 1D chart](https://imgur.com/ZVG0IKv)\n\n**Don't sell MU now, it outperformed most of it's peers**\n*\u201dMICRON TECHNOLOGY INC was among the best performers on Friday.

In comparison, the benchmark SP500 index closed today at -0.0014%.\u201d*\n\n**This is going to be a DD focused on the value of the products (Micron and Crucial memory, data center presence, and consumer use), as well as the value of the company. MU is definitely a long term play, though there is a lot of short term interest at the moment that may cause a run.**\n\n**It is worth noting that MU is a cyclical stock, dependant upon memory demand, hence why I have focused on future memory demand in my DD.**\n\nLatest news: https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/22/micron-stock-has-best-day-in-18-months-traders-see-bigger-breakout.html\n\nMicron climbed a lot on Friday. This was due to an analyst at Evercore ISI adding the memory chip maker to his list of top stock picks. [He anticipates a return to earnings growth next year.](https://www.barrons.com/articles/micron-stock-price-earnings-chip-shortage-51632864045?mod=article_inline).\n\nMU was up 8.4% to $83.52 during Friday afternoon trading. It was the second best performer of the day for the S&P 500 (shortly before 3PM). Evercore ISI analyst C.J. Muse noted that though shares of memory chip makers such as Micron have lagged behind the [PHLX Semiconductor index since early June](https://www.barrons.com/quote/index/us/xnas/sox?mod=article_inline), he believes tides are shifting.\n\n*\u201cWe believe negative sentiment was due to investor concerns over the sustainability of PC, handsets, and cloud demand, which was also compounded by DRAM spot pricing that began to flatten out in May/June 2021,\u201d wrote Muse.*\n\nMuse noted that WSt expectations for Micron\u2019s Feb/May quarter earnings have been cut by 33%/31% respectively, since August. While there could be further downside, weakness is now priced in. He believes either Feb or May quarter will be a bottom for Micron\u2019s earnings. Micron shares tend to outperform one or two quarters before a bottom in earnings, hence he believes the stock could begin a run soon.\n\n*\u201cAnd once they do\u2014we think the stock action could be fast,\u201d Muse wrote. \u201cWe also note most investors expected the memory trade to begin to work in 1Q22 based on our investor survey last month and would not be surprised to start seeing investors look to get positioned in the name ahead of January 1st, 2022.\u201d*\n*Other reasons for the climb:*\n* Citi analyst Christopher Danely said in a research note that recent channel checks show there has been increased demand for DRAM memory among PC makers, and that a pricing correction in the DRAM market is \u201cdrawing to a close\u201d.\n* Danely also said the outlook for enterprise server sales in Q1 22 is better than expected. The server market is improving \u201cdue to recent increases in spending from cloud companies such as Meta and Google\u201d. Danely maintained his buy rating and a $120/share price target.\n* Earlier this week hedge fund Appaloosa Management said it recently sold off almost 3 million shares of MU, to leave the fund with 2.75 million shares.\n\n**Higher future DRAM demand and how this affects Micron:**\n\nMicron is a market leader in DRAM and NAND memory, with a market share of 20%/11% respectively. In 2021, DRAM revenues accounted for 72% of MU\u2019s total revenues, and grew by 38% YoY.  [The company is improving its 1-alpha DRAM](https://www.micron.com/1alpha-dram-technology) to compete with Samsung/SK Hynix.\nThe DRAM market is expected to grow over the long term, due to rising DRAM use in smartphones, PC\u2019s, consumer electronics, automotive and industrials. \n\n*Smartphones:* \n[Since 2016 the average DRAM capacity has risen from 2.4GB to 4.75GB (average of iOS and Android).](https://www.counterpointresearch.com/smartphones-dram-trends-2019-2020/) Micron has stated that 5G phones feature 50% more DRAM than 4G phones. It also expects that 5G and AI will drive new applications such as optimised video capture and editing, which will further fuel DRAM requirements. Phones are very much powerful PC\u2019s living in our pockets now, and as software advances we can expect that DRAM requirements will increase. For example, think about how old iPhones struggle to run new versions of iOS, partially due to insufficient DRAM in older models. \n\n[Check this graph!](https://imgur.com/d9oI7WW)\n\n[\"Micron LPDDR5X DRAM to Feature in MediaTek Dimensity 9000\"](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/micron-lpddr5x-dram-to-feature-in-mediatek-dimensity-9000)\n\n*Data Center:*\nDRAM is integral in servers, notably in data centre applications, it is rapidly evolving to support growing workloads for AI, big data and machine learning. Micron is working on DDR5 to support data center transitions to DDR5 platforms this year.\nData creation is projected to grow at a rate of around 23% in the next 5 years. This would require larger cloud infrastructure in order to handle this. Data centres are generally backed up by an SSD storage array, Micron remains committed to this through it\u2019s NVMe SSD portfolio, and is introducing PCIe 4.0 data centre SSDs. As demand for cloud storage rises, Micron could see increased demand for these products. \n\n*PC/Gaming:*\nFaster RAM leads to faster processing speeds. Intensive use of PCs such as gaming, video editing and streaming require better and more efficient RAM.\nFrom Statista, the chart below shows increasing PC DRAM memory density, with the share of memory >[4GB increasing to 82% in 2020](https://imgur.com/w9w0xPq) \n(https://www.statista.com/statistics/781438/worldwide-computer-dram-shipment-market-share-by-density/)\n\n*Automotive DRAM:*\nAutomotive DRAM only accounts for 1.8% of the DRAM market currently. However, advances in automotive tech such as autonomous driving and vehicle connectivity will drive an increase in this. The Tesla Model 3 has 14GB of DRAM, and next-generation models will use GDDR5 and are expected to have a minimum of 20GB. Although, the average vehicle is estimated to have only 4GB of DRAM in 2021. I expect newer/next-gen vehicles will continue to use even more computing power/DRAM, therefore increasing the market share of Automotive DRAM. Note that Micron are specialists in GDDR5 and 6 memory. Auto NAND accounts for 7% of the NAND market, [it is also expected to see rapid growth due to the rise of ADAS](https://www.eetasia.com/another-nand-flash-for-automotive-ota-ai-and-more/) and clusters of vehicle instruments added to infotainment (requiring greater storage capabilities).\n\n*Industrials & Consumer Electronics:*\nDRAM is used in systems/equipment in manufacturing processes. Industrial type DRAM is more focused on providing a stable solution for reliability. Automation and IoT (Internet of Things) is likely to increase demand for memory/increased memory. In consumer electronics, DRAM is used in tablets, wearables, games consoles, etc. This is the least significant growth factor but still important to note. \nAnother important note is that the PS5 and Xbox use Micron GDDR6 RAM. Samsung and Micron both started producing GDDR6 RAM 3 years ago, while SK Hynix is still ramping up production. The PS5 actually uses Micron RAM (16GB GDDR6 SDRAM), while 512MB of SK Hynix DDR4 RAM is used for background tasks. THe Xbox Series X also uses 16GB of Micron GDDR6 SGRAM. \n\n**My Nvidia thesis:**\n\n**I worked as a qualified IT Hardware, Networking and Software Engineer for 5 or 6 years, and am now an Engineering student at college. I\u2019m a computer geek, especially for hardware. So I\u2019m going to enjoy writing this part. I hope my knowledge lends to it.**\n\n\nAlthough you won\u2019t find much correlation in the [charts](https://imgur.com/o3EaSAV), apart from the recent semi-boom. Nvidia and Micron are very strongly linked. \n\n\n*Increasing penetration of GPU\u2019s in data centres*\n\n\nRecently, data centres have developed into the fields of AI and Machine Learning for functions where a solution is required via rapid iterations. This works well with GPU\u2019s. GPU\u2019s lend themselves perfectly towards [Machine Learning (ML-OLD) functions in data centres](https://www.eetimes.com/ai-chip-menu-expands-for-data-centers/).\n\nNow remember that GPU\u2019s are highly memory intensive. \nThis is corroborated from the data specs of Nvidia\u2019s newest chip, the A100 GPU just released, [designed for AI in data centers](https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/14/21258419/nvidia-ampere-gpu-ai-data-centers-specs-a100-dgx-supercomputer).\n[You can also read more here.](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/ampere-architecture/)\n\n\u201cThe first GPU to use Ampere will be Nvidia\u2019s new (as of 2020) A100, built for scientific computing, cloud graphics, and data analytics. Nvidia new A100 GPU will also include 19.5 teraflops of performance, 6,912 CUDA cores, *40GB of memory*, and *1.6TB/s of memory bandwidth.\u201d* *There\u2019s also a version using 80GB!*\n\n\u201c*Smarter and Faster Memory*\nA100 brings massive amounts of compute to data centers. To keep those compute engines fully utilized, it has a class-leading 2 terabytes per second (TB/sec) of memory bandwidth, more than double the previous generation. In addition, A100 has significantly more on-chip memory, including a 40 megabyte (MB) level 2 cache\u20147X larger than the previous generation\u2014to maximize compute performance.*\u201d\n\nI cannot find any sources (after half an hour of searching) that specify the exact manufacturer of the A100\u2019s memory. However based on my experience, Nvidia consumer GPU\u2019s use either Micron, Samsung or SK Hynix memory. Micron *does* manufacture the [HBM2E memory used in the A100](https://www.micron.com/products/ultra-bandwidth-solutions/hbm2e#:~:text=HBM2E%20%7C%20Micron%20Technologies%2C%20Inc), hence I suspect Micron is one of their memory vendors for their data centre GPU\u2019s. \n\nI found that the Nvidia DGXA100 system (the world\u2019s first AI system built on the A100 Tensor Core GPU, using 8 A100 GPU\u2019s with up to 640GB of GPU memory), actually happens to use [Micron NVME drives](https://docs.nvidia.com/dgx/pdf/dgxa100-service-manual.pdf).

Micron. \n*\u201cMicron has created the world\u2019s fastest discrete graphics memory solution, GDDR6X. GDDR6X was launched with NVIDIA on the GeForce\u00ae RTX\u2122 3090 and GeForce\u00ae RTX\u2122 3080 GPUs (including Ti) to take graphics beyond gaming into true AI. Watch to learn how Micron was able to achieve incredible speeds up to 1 TB/s system memory bandwidth.\u201c*\n\n[Read more here.](https://www.micron.com/products/ultra-bandwidth-solutions/gddr6x)\n\n[Comparison between GDDR5X, GDDR6 and GDDR6X](https://imgur.com/fl8FY68)\n\nThis means Nvidia is dependant on Micron to deliver/manufacture their higher end GPU\u2019s (as Micron are the only manufacturer of GDDR6X memory). Furthermore, Micron GDDR6 memory is commonly found in RTX3050, 3060, 3070 (including Ti) GPU\u2019s. They are not the only manufacturer for this, but are frequently used, for example my RTX 3060 laptop has Micron memory, and my RTX 2070 Super has Micron memory. I use them for crapto mining, and the memory overclocks well. \n\n**Overall I would conclude as long as Nvidia remains strong/bullish, you can be bullish on Micron as Nvidia are dependent on them for their products, particularly in the high-end.**\n\n\n**The AMD link:**\n\nAlthough not as dependent on Micron as Nvidia. AMD [are using Micron GDDR6 memory in their RX6000 series graphics cards:](https://investors.micron.com/news-releases/news-release-details/micron-delivers-high-performance-gddr6-memory-amd-radeon-rx-6000)\n\n\u201cMicron Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: MU), today (November 1st) announced that its high-performance 16Gb/16Gbps GDDR6 memory solution is now available with AMD Radeon\u2122 RX 6000 Series graphics cards built on the AMD RDNA\u2122 2 gaming architecture. Using Micron\u2019s advanced 1z process technology, this latest version of GDDR6 enables up to 512GB/s system performance for demanding applications like gaming and graphics. Today\u2019s announcement continues Micron\u2019s rich history of innovation and collaboration with industry leaders to deliver breakthrough performance that enables the most advanced gaming solutions.\n\n\u201cRadeon RX 6000 Series graphics cards were built to deliver high-performance, no-compromises gaming experiences, and the addition of Micron memory to the product line will help us meet that objective,\u201d said Scott Herkelman, corporate vice president and general manager of the Graphics Business Unit at AMD. \u201cMicron has a strong history of developing advanced memory products, and we worked closely with their engineering team to optimize GDDR6 for RDNA 2 architecture-based graphics cards, giving our board partners more choice and flexibility to produce additional designs for gamers.\u201d\n\n**Is Micron a buy right now?:**\n\nFor the past half year, Micron shares have been trending downwards, however this has changed in November. The shares trended downwards due to a difficult pricing environment for its PC memory products, and macro developments have had their part to play in the downtrend (\u2018mostly the supply chain issues behind a lack of non-memory components which has led to some customers cutting back on memory and storage purchases\u2019).\n\nMicron has recently stated that over the next 10 years, it intends on spending $150 billion (combined) on Global Manufacturing and R&D. Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill believes this plan has brought questions of \u201cpotential over-capacity issues and whether a plan like this would be a large drag on free cash flow.\u201d\n\nMicron believes that \u201csecular growth drivers\u201d such as 5G and AI use cases should see increasing demand for DRAM and NAND. **I covered this in the \u2018Higher future DRAM demand and how this affects Micron\u2019 section of my DD. Thus I think Micron is justified in this belief and spending plan.** Gill thinks it\u2019s a good move, and worries are overblown.\n\n*\u2018\u201cThe current spending plan,\u201d said the 5-star analyst, \u201cWhen annualized and put into context, is nothing out of the ordinary and should neither cause significant increases in industry capacity (so there should be no resulting price wars from the competition) nor be a significant drag on free cash flow, which would continue to grow and reach historical highs as a % of sales.\u201d\u2019*\n\nGill agrees with Micron, in that continued demand for DRAM and NAND based on 5G/AI drivers is important to focus on.\n\n\u201cIn fact, Gill thinks the company will have enough free cash flow to provide it with a \u201chigh level of capital return flexibility,\u201d which during cyclical sell-off periods, for example, could see the company repurchase shares. Additionally, should the need arise for \u201ccompetitive reasons,\u201d it will also provide a \u201csafety buffer\u201d for more R&D or CapEx spending.\u201d\n\nGill reiterated a Buy rating for MU stock with a $130 price target. 14 other analysts join Gil on the bull list, with another 6 holds and 1 sell, the stock has a moderate buy consensus rating (as of Oct 27 2021, I\u2019ll add more recent figures in the following section). \n\n[\u201cThe 47 rating InvestorsObserver gives to Micron Technology, Inc. (MU) stock puts it near the middle of the Semiconductors industry. In addition to scoring higher than 38 percent of stocks in the Semiconductors industry, MU\u2019s 47 overall rating means the stock scores better than 47 percent of all stocks.\u201d](https://www.investorsobserver.com/news/stock-update/does-micron-technology-inc-mu-have-what-it-takes-to-be-in-your-portfolio-friday)\n\n[WSJ Analyst Ratings](https://imgur.com/fgGQbHV)\n[TipRanks Analyst Ratings](https://imgur.com/k85pW0e)\n[MarketBeat Analyst Ratings](https://imgur.com/6KStq0U)\n\n**Has Micron Run Its Cyclical Course?:**\n\nI will be heavily sourcing from [this great and recent Nasdaq article](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/has-micron-run-its-cyclical-course) for this section.\n\n\u2018On the face of it, year-to-date, Micron\u2019s stock price is almost at the same level. However, its stock has been on a 2021 roller-coaster ride. It opened 2021 at $77.42, and hit $95.3 in the first week of April. Since then, the stock steadily fell until it hit $67-levels in October. It spent time consolidating in October before starting to rise again.\u2019\n\nThis fall is due to Micron\u2019s cyclical nature of business. The stock moves based on the demand/supply for memory. \u2018When the world needed semiconductors, the stock moved up. Now, as the world is slowly opening up, there was a fall in its stock price. However, Micron stock seems to have bottomed out.\u2019\n\nThe company has beaten earnings expectations in the last four quarters (each of), the company has delivered profits and has not disappointed investors. \n\n\u2018Micron Technology president and CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said that the demand outlook for 2022 was strong, and Micron would continue to deliver innovative solutions. For the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the company\u2019s guidance is $7.65 billion in revenue, with a gross margin of 46%.\u2019\n\nA June report by Global Market Insights states that semiconductor memory market revenue will cross $180 billion by 2027. It said, \u201cThe growing uptake of Dynamic Random-access Memory (DRAM) in gaming consoles, PC hardware, and high-performance computing devices will support the industry growth.\u201d\n\nMicron has stated that memory and storage are a growing portion of this industry, representing approximately 30% of the semi market. The company also stated that government support would be crucial for its expansion plans, as memory manufacturing in the US costs around 35%-45% more compared to lower cost markets. \u2018Funding to support new semiconductor manufacturing capacity is a must, said EVP of Global Operations Manish Bhatia. He added, \u201cSustained government support is essential for Micron to ensure a resilient supply chain and reinforce technology leadership for the long term.\u201d\u2019\n\n\u2018The top three companies in the sector invest billions of dollars every year to manufacture chips. These chips are increasingly getting more complicated and expensive with every passing generation. It is very unlikely that price wars will break out over market share. The game will be played on quality.\u2019 **Refer to my section about GDDR6X memory, Micron is delivering TOP quality.**\n\nInvestors (regards) will have to accept that the company stock price is generally going to be volatile, due to its cyclical nature. However you can take comfort in the fact that the lows/highs for the stock will generally move up. \u2018The company has realized this and has purchased 15.6 million shares of its common stock for $1.2 billion during the fiscal year of 2021.\u2019\n[Here is a useful article explaining the volatility of MU this past month.](https://investchronicle.com/2021/11/16/here-is-why-micron-technology-inc-mu-stock-volatility-recorded-over-the-last-month-was-2-30/)\n\n\u2018Tipranks\u2019 Stock Forecast Tool indicates 15 out of 22 analysts have given MU a Buy rating, while six analysts have a Hold rating on the stock and just one has a Sell rating on the stock.\n\nThe average Micron price target is $96.09, which indicates 24.2% upside potential.\u2019\n\u2018A number of equities analysts recently commented on the company. Barclays decreased their target price on Micron Technology from $110.00 to $87.00 and set an \"overweight\" rating for the company in a report on Wednesday, September 29th. JPMorgan Chase & Co. decreased their target price on Micron Technology from $140.00 to $100.00 and set an \"overweight\" rating for the company in a report on Friday, September 24th. UBS Group decreased their target price on Micron Technology from $95.00 to $90.00 and set a \"buy\" rating for the company in a report on Wednesday, September 29th. Morgan Stanley restated a \"hold\" rating and set a $75.00 target price on shares of Micron Technology in a report on Wednesday, September 29th. Finally, The Goldman Sachs Group decreased their target price on Micron Technology from $104.00 to $88.00 and set a \"buy\" rating for the company in a report on Thursday, October 14th. One equities research analyst has rated the stock with a sell rating, eight have assigned a hold rating, twenty-three have assigned a buy rating and two have assigned a strong buy rating to the company's stock. Based on data from MarketBeat.com, the stock has an average rating of \"Buy\" and an average target price of $103.31.\u2019\n\n**Upcoming Quarterly Sales/Next Earnings:**\n\n[Analysts expect that Micron will report $7.66 billion in sales for the current quarter](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-mu-consensus-analyst-rating-2021-11-2-3/), according to Zacks Investment Research. The highest sales estimate of 6 is $7.67 billion, and the lowest is $7.65 billion. Micron posted sales of $5.77 billion during the same quarter last year, indicating YoY growth of 32.8%. Next earnings date is Monday, December 20th. \nOn average, analysts expect full-year sales of $31.34 billion (for the current financial year). For the next fiscal year, analysts forecast reported sales of $35.60 billion on average. \nMicron last issued its earnings results on Monday, September 27th. \u201c The semiconductor manufacturer reported $2.42 earnings per share (EPS) for the quarter, topping the Thomson Reuters' consensus estimate of $2.33 by $0.09. The business had revenue of $8.27 billion during the quarter, compared to analyst estimates of $8.21 billion. Micron Technology had a return on equity of 15.98% and a net margin of 21.16%. Micron Technology's revenue for the quarter was up 36.6% on a year-over-year basis. During the same quarter in the prior year, the firm earned $1.00 earnings per share.\u201d\n**I could write way more for this DD. But for the sake of keeping it shorter, I am now moving into the TA, Options and Conclusion sections**\n**Technical Analysis** \nI defer to Tradingview and other sources for this section. \n\n*Tradingview TA overviews:*\n[1 day](https://imgur.com/zVXwLTm)\n[1 week](https://imgur.com/xqyt4cz)\n[1 month](https://imgur.com/kaZDnSQ)\n\n**Most recent TA from Tradingview ideas:**\n\n**[this chart is beautiful](https://imgur.com/lP5mBYE) - Nov 19:**\n\u201cvery nice rally after a downtrend breakout here on MU ! today we are approaching a big resistance zones on the RSI and chart.\n\nWe can break resistance and continue a rally to all time high next week, but I think we will most likely see a few more weeks of consolidation first so the RSI can cool off.\n\u201c\n\n**[MU Long setup](https://imgur.com/ShnyQn8) - Nov 18:**\n\u201cMU after correction, going for final push for W-1 of W-5\u201d\n\n**[MU TRADE IDEA](https://imgur.com/z3mjHUK) - Nov 16:**\n\u201cUpside looks limited from here. Expecting us to pullback into a corrective wave 2 into a very buyable dip around $70. Be patient on this one, it's only getting started\u201d My gut says this guy is incorrect tbh, given the recent push. \n\n\n**[After 200 days we can see a breakout](https://imgur.com/Vmhx9Al) - Nov 12, very in-depth:**\n\u201cToday we will take a look at Micron Technology , a company that engages in the provision of innovative memory and storage solutions. Time to check the Technical elements on the chart:\n\n1) From 2018 until November 2020 the price was inside a massive range until we saw the breakout of it and a 50% bullish movement from that situation towards the top of the bullish impulse\n\n2) From April until today the price has been consolidating on a clear corrective pattern where we can define both top and bottom edges\n\n3) How can we know that the structure is finished? Two reasons here: first we have clear edges (previous item) and second the structure has made contact with a key level, in this case, the ascending trendline.\n\n4) Now we have a breakout of the corrective pattern. Remember that Technical Analysis is a statistical discipline, which means that we are never gonna have certainty about a situation. However, we know that if we engage in quality situations over certain periods, we will be able to observe consistent results.\n\n5) We are not taking setup on this stock, (we already have exposure on other assets). However, it's an interesting situation to wait for a throwback (retest of a broken structure). IF that happens, we have defined an activation level as you can see on the chart (ALWAYS ABOVE THE TRENDLINE)\n\n6) Depending on how aggressive is the setup you are taking, the invalidation level can be: FIRST below the whole structure 65.00 / SECOND below the throwback (this setup provides a massive risk to reward ratio, however, is prone to a quick stop loss)\n\n7) Targets: IF I would be executing a setup here, I would protect my setup once the price reaches the previous top, which shares a major resistance zone that you can see on the weekly chart (2% below that, I want to be risk-free) / Now, the places to close setups on profit can be the first or 2nd Fibonacci extension . The expected duration of a movement like this may be between 200 to 300 days.\n\n8)RISK: This is the formula I use to trade: I never have more than 5 setups at the same time NEVER EVER. And the maximum % of risk I take on any setup is 3% (ONLY with a STRATEGY THAT YOU HAVE a lot of EXPERIENCE WITH). Let's understand this better, most of my setups happen on the daily chart , which means that time resolutions are between 2 weeks to 3 months. Another rule I use is that my setups must happen on uncorrelated assets example: NFLX / BTCUSD / XAUUSD / FCX / AMZN . So my worst-case scenario is losing all at the same time which means a -10% to -15%. That's more than acceptable for me. And the most probable thing is that I would be able to open 4 to 5 new setups 1 to 2 months later. That's why this type of trading style is so secure. Even in apocalyptic scenarios, you would face a manageable loss, and it will take you time to develop new setups (you avoid impulsive trading)\u201d\n\n**Update**: Latest TA on Tradingview: [11/21/21 MU](https://imgur.com/qWKVBgp) - Nov 21:**\n\n\"Current Price: $83.03\nBreakout price trigger: $83.80\nBuy Zone (Top/Bottom Range): $81.00-$78.00\nPrice Target: $89.00-$90.00 (1st), $95.00-$97.20 (2nd)\nEstimated Duration to Target: 45-49d (1st), 60-64d (2nd)\n\nContract of Interest: $MU 12/17/21 82.5c, $MU 1/21/22 85c\nTrade price as of publish date: $3.75/contract, $4.80/contract\"\n\n**Tickeron AI TA, copied here so you don\u2019t have to sign up for an account.

I would advise to go for LEAPS and shares for this stock - either ITM or slightly OTM. If it becomes ITM, you can always roll to a higher strike if you wish.*\n\n*High-risk:*\nBe regarded and YOLO to play earnings on December 20th. I would suggest either buying ITM 80c or slightly OTM 85c for December 23 or December 31st. 90c if you like crayons. \n\n* [December 2021 options chain](https://imgur.com/QD3ROzy)\n\n*Medium risk:*\nBuy 80c, 82.5c, 85c for April, June, July or September. Or if you\u2019re regarded 87.50 and 90c.Play on the thesis that MU has a lot of value, will do well in December earnings (maybe), has great products, and that the downtrend is beginning to turn into an uptrend as I believe. I would suggest buying shares also. \n\n* [April 2022 options chain](https://imgur.com/YjV5c6i)\n\n* [June 2022 options chain](https://imgur.com/2kBPlPs)\n\n* [July 2022 options chain](https://imgur.com/PIj2Mz6)\n\n* [September 2022 options chain](https://imgur.com/wSJkFez)\n\n\n*Low(ish...they\u2019re still options) risk:*\nBuy 80c or 82.50c for Jan 2023, June 2023 or Jan 2024. Medium/low risk is 85c. Medium/low risk but still regarded is 90c.  Even better would be to buy warrant options. \n\n* [January 2023 options chain](https://imgur.com/mbsv9AF)\n\n* [June 2023 options chain](https://imgur.com/Pz0HOkU)\n\n* [January 2024 options chain](https://imgur.com/GSTkEPb)\n\nMedium/low risk:\nBuy 80c or 82.5c for 2022 and LEAPS for 2023/2024. Maybe warrants, if that is possible for you. Also buy shares. \n\n*My position:*\nI'm a Europoor with a small account. I got up to $8000 from $1500 (largely AMD and NVDA gains) this year but I had to spend it on life shit. So I've started agan from $336, up to $551 now from NVDA and FB calls, as well as some daytrading.\n\n$134.33 of 12.21 86c warrant calls\n$69 of 03.22 90c warrant calls\n$69 of 06.22 96c warrant calls\nAs of 14:47\n(account value has increased to $620)\nedit: Bought $40 more of 06.22 at 15:07, other positions have increased in value.\n\nYes I'm regarded.\n\n\nI hope my small position assures you this is not a P&D (I hate them), I simply love writing DDs and am trying improve my skill at them (and share my in-depth research).\n\n\n\n**Where should I enter? (options or shares):**\n\nLook out for a mini-dip on Monday or sometime next week. Enter there. Consider using DCA to get a better average cost over multiple dips.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nI think this DD speaks for itself. Micron has great drivers/catalysts to drive the price upwards. It is investing heavily in itself. Nvidia is dependent on them. I am very bullish on MU after doing this research. I will try to open a position of LEAPS and shares as soon as I have the funds. \n\n**TL;DR:**\n\n* MU bounced on Friday, perhaps this is the sign that its downtrend is reversing.\n\n* Higher future DRAM demand will push up Micron. DRAM is used in Smartphones, Data centres, PC/Gaming, Automotive, Industrials and Consumer Electronics. Increased demand in these sectors will drive up Micron\u2019s value. \n\n* Nvidia uses Micron memory in it\u2019s data centre GPU\u2019s.\n\n* Nvidia\u2019s ONLY supplier of GDDR6X memory used in higher-end gaming GPU\u2019s is Micron. Nvidia is dependent on them for this high-performance memory.\n\n* AMD are using Micron GDDR6(not X) memory in their RX 6000 series GPU\u2019s.\n\n* Micron\u2019s downtrend has changed in November. \n\n* Micron intends to spend $150 billion combined on Global Manufacturing and R&D.\n\n* $130 price target from Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill.\n\n* Micron moves based on the supply/demand for memory.\n\n* Micron may have bottomed out now, and is due to go up.\n\n* \u2018Tipranks\u2019 Stock Forecast Tool indicates 15 out of 22 analysts have given MU a Buy rating, while six analysts have a Hold rating on the stock and just one has a Sell rating on the stock.\nThe average Micron price target is $96.09, which indicates 24.2% upside potential.\n\n* [Analysts expect that Micron will report $7.66 billion in sales for the current quarter](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-mu-consensus-analyst-rating-2021-11-2-3/), according to Zacks Investment Research. The highest sales estimate of 6 is $7.67 billion, and the lowest is $7.65 billion. Micron posted sales of $5.77 billion during the same quarter last year, indicating YoY growth of 32.8%. Next earnings date is Monday, December 20th. \n\n* On average, analysts expect full-year sales of $31.34 billion (for the current financial year). For the next fiscal year, analysts forecast reported sales of $35.60 billion on average. \n \n**Are there any sections or points I'm missing?**\n\nPart 2: [$MU (Micron Technologies) DD (part 2, more concise); A look at the price history on Friday and this week, LPDDR5X DRAM, P/E Ratio, NAND Flash growth, and the CEO's performance.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r18dmo/mu_micron_technologies_dd_part_2_more_concise_a/)", "id": "qzkdma", "created_utc": 1637584208.0, "score": 204, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 66, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 43, "replies": [{"body": "I lost my ass during the mu 90c meme last time.", "score": 5, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1701752096414566}, {"body": "85c woud be safer. 90c if you are a regarded degenrate.
