People were investing in companies that were operating out of parking garages, expecting them to scale to meet massive expectations. Poor managment, logistics issues, supply chain managment, you name it, these companies couldn't get their shit together and *boom* they started to evaporate overnight, which led lenders and venture capitalists to rethink their strategies. Once the free money dried up, the party was over.\n\nSecond, the FED. There was a ton of money being lent, and the FED decided they wanted a piece of the pie. This is what initially upset the market as lending dried up when the FED raised intrest rates and startups burned through remaining capital like toilet paper.\n\nThird, 9/11, Black Swan, the markets absolutly shat themselves on 9/11. Nothing more to add here. Note that this happened after the Dotcom crash, but it corellated to drag down the recovery.\n\nFourth, Worldcom, Enron, and the SOX act. Ah yes, the market death blow. Companies got caught cooking the books hard, and the US Government regulated harder. Market confidence was shook, and the SOX act required companies self-regulate their accounting which was seen (at the time) as a huge expense to the bottom line. Again, suppressed any chance of a quick recovery.\n\nSo when people say \"The Docom bubble popped\" what they really mean is a series of unconnected but extremely bearish events that hit the market over a short time span. Alone any one of them would have probably spured a correction at best, or a short crash and recovery in the case of 9/11. Combined they led to the what most now reflect upon as the Dotcom crash and the rest is history.\n\nSo I guess what I'm trying to say is, hang in there...don't chase FOMO, invest in solid companies with solid books...this is just a bump in the road right now.", "score": 66, "replies": [{"body": "Actually it's far more complicated than that, what's interesting is why they raised rates, it was because of the yeild curve which ticked off markets, also 9/11 happend one year after it burst, and third yes lots of dot com companies were shit but everyone forgot about cisco, yahoo, Intel, Nokia,AOL  which were profitable companies that were growing but were overvalued and pulled up the garbage on the way up and pulled the garbage down with them as well, similar to how ever ev no matter sales is valued high because of tesla, also I think a better parallel is the great depression more so than dot com since dot com was mainly one sector while the depression was a mismatch of many overvalued sectors similar to now", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "The great depression was because the 1920's version of the FED basically said \"It's our duty to BTFD\" and got hammered.
