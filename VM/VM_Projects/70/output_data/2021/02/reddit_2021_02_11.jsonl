{"title": "Which Cannabis Stocks?", "selftext": "Relatively new to WSB thread so be gentle. I'm writing this to give everyone some research I've done on the pot industry. The purpose here is to educate and make smart decisions with your money. Whether that be long term growth or just pumping everything for the home run to the moon, you do you. Just make money folks.\n\nWe all know the cannabis industry is on the brink of legalization. There are so many companies out there. Some will survive and some won't. The overall goal is to deep dive into this to figure out which companies have an established footprint and the best chance to become the industry leaders (think of the AMZN or AAPL of the pot industry).\n\nAnyway, here are some picks I've researched:\n\n**$MJ - ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF**If you're not interested in trying to pick big winners but want exposure to the industry, MJ is probably the number one most active fund that spreads their portfolio out all over. Top holdings can be found here: [https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/fund/mj/holdings](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/fund/mj/holdings)\n\n**$PLNHF - Planet 13 Holdings Inc**  \nCannabis company based out of Nevada. For those who have been to Vegas, they have the largest dispensary in the world. Not only do they have an established footprint in retail, but they have the ability to expand and deploy and already successful business model with a $1.6B market cap.\n\n**$CXXIF - C21 Investments**  \nCompetitor to Planet 13 Holdings in NV. Many Cannabis ETFs are continuing to purchase more shares since this is company is relatively undervalued compared to its peers. They have large amounts of free cash and recently brought in some high profile investment managers.\n\n**$TLRY - Tilray**  \nCanadian pharmaceutical and cannabis company that recently announced a $3.9B merger with Aphria ($APHA) to become the world's largest production and distribution company in the industry. They've also agreed to start exporting to the UK, giving them access to a much larger customer base.\n\n**$TCNNF - Trulieve Cannabis Corp.**  \n\\*\\*One of the top performing cannabis companies in the United States. They recently opened a third dispensary in Jacksonville, FL, bringing their total footprint to 73 locations in Florida. Similar to Planet 13, this company has most of their presence on the east coast.\n\n**$CRON - Cronos Group**  \nCronos Group engages in the production and distribution of pot. I consider this one of the safest bets since it based by Altria, the tobacco giant that holds 45% of the company. They've posted consistent, solid earnings and continue to look into lab grown opportunities to reduce costs and become more efficient.\n\nTL;DR - These are some of the most popular weed stocks that offer you idiots to expose yourselves to the legalization of marijuana. They have the best chance to continue massive growth as opposed to picking the next penny stock.\n\nEdit: had to edit $C21 to correct ticker $CXXIF.

{"title": "[TSLA] Pelosi leaps playbook", "selftext": "You may have all heard that Pelosi's husband bought [1m in tsla calls.](https://disclosures-clerk.house.gov/public_disc/ptr-pdfs/2021/20018011.pdf) last month.\n\nMaybe some of you are getting sick of chasing after GME and APHA wrecked your asses and wanna play some real stocks IDK.\n\nI believe that bets are best placed BEFORE the stock is at ATH, so I think this is a good time to post this while TSLA is going through some dips.\n\nThere is a lot to talk about when it comes to everyone's favorite CEO, but I think the biggest headwinds are these:\n\n1. EV credits are coming\n2. FSD beta currently being used by 1000 lucky(?) Tesla drivers.\n3. The House Majority Leader Pelosi bought leaps. \n4. *censored topic here*\n\nI don't wanna make this really long, so I just want to go over what exactly she bought.\n\n25 contracts [$500 strike expiring at March 18, 2022](https://imgur.com/Nlw4PWZ) \n\nNote that she's actually down about 30k on these as of today. Are you mad about politicians insider trading? Well holy fuck you have a chance to get in at LESS than what she paid.\n\nThis is what her payout looks like: https://imgur.com/blP7gLZ\n\nBasically she can't lose any money unless TSLA closes below $940 in by March 2022. However, you will notice that the leverage applied is only 1~2x. Basically this is like baby leverage vs holding shares.\n\nI wanted to entertain some alternatives. So what if you got bigger balls and say TSLA doubles from here at the minimum? https://imgur.com/ZZGDYUN\n\nYou can see the upside is so much higher but tsla has to move a lot fast to outrun the theta burn.\n\nSo what if you thought about theta and want to spread it instead? (A spread is when you buy a call then sell a call further otm.) https://imgur.com/HoPgNl1\n\nYou probably noticed here that payout distribution gets bigger as you get close to expiration. Personally I think this is a better play than ITM calls, but of course, if TSLA pulls another 5x from here, nothing beats the uncapped upside of plain calls.\n\nAt the end of the day however, if TSLA just goes down 10% from here and doesn't come back for a year, all of these are expiring worthless. Btw kind of fucking crazy that if you have 100 TSLA shares you can collect almost guaranteed 60% a year. \n\nDid you buy GME because you hate the establishment and their privileged trading free money? Well, they're doing this one in broad daylight. Would you take it? \n\nAlso not financial advice. Gamble your chrome money at your own risk.\n\nI like kitties but I am not into roaring.\n\nI also check this site every day to see if any other [lawmakers are buying for additional confirmation.](https://senatestockwatcher.com/ticker.html?ticker=TSLA)", "id": "lhr4ld", "created_utc": 1613068229.0, "score": 76, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 73, "comments": [{"body": "Instructions unclear, stuck dick in toaster", "score": 96, "replies": [{"body": "Better *on* than *in*", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Sorry, I meant in.
