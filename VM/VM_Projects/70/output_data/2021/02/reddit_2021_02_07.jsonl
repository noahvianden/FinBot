{"title": "My hopes for GME", "selftext": "Hi all, this is just my opinion, not advice, don't take it seriously. I like GameStop and am holding 26 shares purchased at an average price of $100, some bought at $21, some at $218.\n\nI think three things need to happen for $GME to go up \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf11.\n\nFirst, the business has to show improvements. The most crucial factor to convince a \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b that he/she should not be bearish is business' growth in customers, services, cash flow, profit, whatever else that can be counted as a good thing. There are many good things going for GME now in terms of new talent in the team, new consoles, all this hype, etc., so I look forward to seeing improvements that tear down the bear theory.\n\nSecond, obviously, shareholders need to hold the shares \ud83e\udd1a\ud83d\udc8e\u270b and buy the dips. Moreover, I think community involvement can help: from visiting the store and buying some goodies from them, to sharing good experiences on social media, all the way to reaching out to the leadership of the company and telling them about what is bad and needs to improve (constructive feedback). Papa Cohen, if you read this, I want free shipping on orders above $25 please!\n\nThird, also obviously, the shorts covering their shorts should drive the price up. I strongly believe that this will not happen just because it hurts them in their vaginas. Remember Elon and how he had to invite (literally call out) the head of a fund that was shorting TSLA to visit the factories and see with his eyes that things are for real? Shorters stopped shorting TSLA when they and their clients stopped being \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b about it, and not so much because they were bleeding money.\n\nTlDr: This fight can be about big money fighting many retards' small money.
