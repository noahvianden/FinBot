{"title": "Sectors to watch for in Q2 2021", "selftext": "1 Transportation and Delivery\n\nTransportation and delivery stocks took a hit last March when the disruption of pandemic came. Almost one year later they have recovered strongly. Staying at home and working from home have created unprecedented demand for transportation and delivery of goods via vehicles on highways. As the vaccination looms and the economy reopens, the demand might drop, but the habits nurtured during the pandemic could linger for quite a while. I am still cautious about airline stocks; air travel is still far from recovering even 1/3 of what it was before the pandemic and I won\u2019t make a move until the volume reaches about 1/2 . \n\nLooking at: PAG, KSU, UPS, FDX, UBER, UNP\n\n======\n\n2 More traditional/\u201d big players\u201d financial stocks\n\nI have opened another post asking for advice, so I will just be copying and pasting:\n\nFintech stocks and ETFs are popular on the market nowadays and I\u2019ve reaped quite some profits from ARKF, PYPL, SQ, V, virtual currency ETFs e.t.c. But now I am eyeing in on the more traditional/big Wall Street players like Citibank, JPM, Morgan Stanley, Goldman e.t.c. All flaws and blames and crooked behaviors aside, they are still the biggest players in the financial market nowadays and the establishment can\u2019t be overwhelmed by a few Reddit short squeezes. I am trying to observe if these stocks could sort of \"recover\" from the shock and respond to the innovative trend.\n\nThere\u2019s also another realm of more diversified asset management player such as CG, BX, BLK, NTRS e.t.c. It seems the pandemic has a very strong asset/wealth reallocation effects and the wealthiest that could afford to have their assets managed by these players are doing well. These institutions also typically have quite established footings in emerging markets such as Asia and South America in both government and private businesses. CG has recently published a pleasant Q4 2020 report and their stocks climbed. I am waiting to see if BX, BLK and NTRS would follow suit.\n\nLooking at: JPM, BX, BLK, NTRS, CG, BAM\n\n======\n\n3 Military and Defense\n\nThe mainstream media tries hard to paint a layer of peaceful color to the new administration, but tensions around the globe won\u2019t just disappear. The US military has quite a few major contracts for new weapon systems delivery coming up, and US arms sales to allies could increase as many of them are located at the forefronts of tensions (Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Saudi, India e.t.c).\n\nLooking at: LDOS, LMT, GD, NOC, BA (more for its military contracts rather than for commercial airplanes)\n\n======\n\n4 Tech Infrastructures\n\nWith everything shifting to online platform, Tech stocks (IT, cloud computing, semiconductors e.t.c.) have done well in 2020. I am in MSFT and TSM, and I just want to take a look at stocks that offer a more infrastructural exposure to the tech advancements, such as base towers for 5G, solutions for cloud computing and online platforms, workstations, hardware production e.t.c.\n\nLooking at: CCI, AMT, CSCO, MSI, ERIC\n\n======\n\n5 Virtual Currency\n\nI am not a big fan of virtual currencies so far, and it might be a bit late to enter the game. but nobody could deny the soaring prices of every major virtual currency, and I certainly don\u2019t mind to ride the bandwagon and get a few extra bucks. \n\nLooking at: BLOK, KOIN", "id": "lk4o91", "created_utc": 1613359876.0, "score": 88, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 73, "comments": [{"body": "Sir, this is a GameStop dispensary.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
