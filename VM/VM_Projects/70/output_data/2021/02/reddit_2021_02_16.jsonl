When you look at [inflation data](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/historical-inflation-rates/), inflation runs in highest in 2008 and 2011 when these commodities spiked. If the Federal Reserve targets inflation at 2% and we see a repeat of +3.5% in 2011 and +4-5% such as in 2008, then how does the Federal Reserve not raise rates?\n\nOn top of that, [Lumber](https://markets.businessinsider.com/commodities/lumber-price) is at 52 week high, really in uncharted territory, almost double its historic price. This is undoubtedly impacting non-food consumer goods across the board.\n\nSome of these prices are driven by weather, but some geo-political. Swine flu is dying down in China driving soybean prices up due to larger hog herd, Russia (#3 producer) is restricting wheat exports, Argentina (#4 producer) suspending corn exports due to drought. Byproducts of these commodities such as beef, pork, poultry and dairy will likely raise significantly as costs go up.\n\nOn top of this we are seeing a $15 dollar minimum wage push in the U.S. that will undoubtedly hit he bottom line for food prices as manual labor benefits. Tom Vilsack, former governor of Iowa should be confirmed as agricultural secretary is a huge bull on ethanol which should continue to rise corn prices.\n\nEnergy wise, a rebound from covid should drive up oil demand along with the administrations policies on restricting additional exploration, drilling and pipelines.\n\nThis comes to the question - why are forecasters predicting inflation below 2% irregardless of the documented indicators above?
