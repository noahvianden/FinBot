Unprecedented fiscal and monetary support in Washington also played a critical role in the market\u2019s resilience, which will drive stocks higher in the long run, the bank said.\n\n\u201cWe believe that we are still in the early stages of a new bull market, transitioning from the \u2018Hope\u2019 phase to a longer \u2018Growth\u2019 phase as strong profit growth emerges,\u201d said chief global equity strategist  Peter Oppenheimer said in a note.\n\n\u201cThe changing mix of policy support in this cycle also suggests a possible inflection point towards a more reflationary environment than we have seen since the financial crisis,\u201d Oppenheimer added. \u201cThis regime shift is likely to drive the bull market higher over coming months and also have important implications for market leadership.\u201d\n\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/04/goldman-says-the-bull-market-is-still-in-the-early-stages-gives-six-trades-to-play-it.html?__source=iosappshare%7Ccom.apple.UIKit.activity.CopyToPasteboard", "id": "lcy74h", "created_utc": 1612495223.0, "score": 119, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 73, "comments": [{"body": "This makes me want to sell. in my experience goldman does not have their finger on the pulse", "score": 104, "replies": [{"body": "I hear you but Tom Lee believes the bull rally continues.
