{"title": "Journey to $1 Million - Valentines Edition - Week of Feb 16th, 2021", "selftext": "Happy Valentines Day! Just remember that you are loved here! Thanks for the immense support that everyone is giving me! Pro Stock Advice has experienced exponential growth and it is due to people like yourself reading this right now. So in the paraphrased words of Kid Cudi:\n\n    If I die, before I wake  \n    I pray the Lord my soul to take  \n    But please don't cry  \n    Just know that I have made these ***write ups*** for you. \n\nLast week ended well, which was a surprise that the markets didn't sell off coming up to the long weekend. It was one of those weeks where you can have a pleasant weekend without worrying about your positions to much, that is always the goal. Monday is Presidents Day (Happy P Day?) and the stock market is closed. I will resume my trading on Tuesday at opening bell as well as posting these daily write ups.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**$CLII** \\- Climate Change Crisis Real Impact Acq Corp is another SPAC charging station play similar to $SBE, that we discussed. They are suppose to be merging with EVgo. The EVgo and CLII merger deal is expected to close in the second quarter of 2021. The merger is subject to approval from CLII\u2019s shareholders and other customary closing conditions - which is why $SBE price sold off on news of a delay in sharing holder voting. Of course, with all SPACs we need to be careful; a lot is based on rumors and conjecture. Holding commons, I believe, is the best strategy here.\n\n* Target Price: $30\n* Entry: <$20\n* Risk: 5\n* Timeframe: 4-6 months\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aoec0zbjgeh61.png?width=1018&format=png&auto=webp&s=7fd05a24777a4f366c8f95ab941d97d85fa410d8\n\n \n\n**$NXE -** NexGen Energy Ltd. NexGen Energy Ltd. engages in the acquisition, exploration, and development of uranium properties. There is a growing deficit of Uranium, and by no surprise to me stocks like these have soared in the past weeks. I don't see any stop to that either. Of course, I like to buy at support, or on discount, so if there is a pullback, I will be loading up.\n\n* Target Price: $5.5\n* Entry: <$3\n* Risk: 5\n* Timeframe: 3-6 months\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/49odxujkgeh61.png?width=1018&format=png&auto=webp&s=d90c93567ae83d7884f44ba83b5e6f92f7a246b1\n\n \n\n**$NET -** Also making its rounds on the net recently (pun intended) is Cloudfare. $NET is a web infrastructure and security company. There isn't really a surprise that this is a triple digit stock due to the rapidly growing demand of these services and that Cloudfare is among the leaders in its industry.

The same goes for buying a put. You have the right but not the obligation to sell shares at the contracts strike price.\n\nThis means in your scenario you would likely do nothing and let the contract expire worthless since you could buy 100 shares of the underlying in the open market for far less than the strike price of your option.\n\nIt is only when *writing* a call or put that you have an obligation to do something if the contract is exercised.\n\nOptions are a great way to leverage your buying power with clearly defined risk when you\u2019re buying them as opposed to writing them. That being said, having iron clad discipline is going to be essential when you begin trading options. Sure, the risk is defined, but options are rapidly depreciating assets that you MUST do something with, either buying/selling to close the position or exercising. So yes, in your scenario you only lost $1500 but you should give yourself more credit that you won\u2019t let it get that bad. You MUST be agnostic about your position so that you\u2019re able to exit it quickly when it turns against you, or when it becomes profitable so you can lock in your gains and move onto the next one.\n\nI traded stocks for over a decade before I began trading options and while you can learn valuable lessons trading stocks you will have to change the way you think of your investing timeline, attitude, and risk tolerance. I lost a lot of money watching a stock price move in my predicted direction, but not fast enough to make me any money, and I\u2019ve lost a lot of money being in the money but not exercising/closing the position before it turned against me. \n\nBe ready to take a 20% gain or swallow a 20% loss so you don\u2019t end up consistently losing the entirety of your options contract value.

You\u2019re broker probably doesn\u2019t let you anyway.\n\n\nIIRC, if the call you bought expires out of the money (below the strike price), you not only don\u2019t get the shares, but you lose the premium you put into it too (the money that you paid the contract with).\n\nIf the loss is at or exceeds your limits, you should just close the position by selling back the contract you bought.
