{"title": "Uranium market is NOT a pump and dump, but it will see great gains in the short AND long term.", "selftext": "TL;DR - uranium stocks are undervalued, the last uranium bull market saw massive gains, and there is plenty of positive news and international support to invest in this market short & long term.\n\nI\u2019ve been digging into this uranium market and I\u2019m seeing some awesome things. Do your own DD and make your own choices - I DO NOT GIVE FINANCIAL ADVICE. \n\nFirst, there is a lot of positive news for nuclear power. This week has seen a massive pump because of the power crisis in Texas. Despite Texas\u2019s negligence in that case it has brought nuclear to the forefront of world attention which is a great thing. There was already a LOT of positive movement before this week though, with many uranium stocks seeing +100% from Dec - Feb. Biden has shown pro-nuclear sentiments for his clean energy plans, big deals have been happening with companies like DNN, and Japan is finally getting back into the nuclear power field again after the Fukushima accident (which crashed the last uranium bull market). Japan getting back in alone will increase demand and in turn increase prices which elevate stock value. Lots of great news here. I believe Elon is very pro-nuclear as well and will be interested to see if he comments on it. \n\nThe last uranium bull market started around year 2000 and the biggest gains were seen up through 2007. Companies like Paladin (PALAF) saw gains of over 100,000%. Back then there were hundreds of uranium companies, now there are only around 50 - 60 and some of those are dormant. \n\nSome strong tickers to look into are UUUU ($5.94), PENMF ($0.14), DNN ($1.40), NXE ($3.77), DYLLF ($0.65),  & CCJ ($17). There are plenty more floating around but from my personal searching these seem the strongest to me. CCJ is essentially the largest miner and is around $17 - which is the MOST EXPENSIVE stock in this list. \ud83e\udd2f. That means some of these are OTC stocks though so sorry Robinhood users - get a real broker. \n\nThe leadership from Paladin (the company that saw 100x in the early 2000\u2019s) has moved to DYLLF (aka Deep Yellow) which is currently trading for only $0.65. Their CEO is a legend in the field so this is pretty promising. \n\nFor a safer play, there is an ETF avail for around $60 - URNM. \n\nMost of you have probably seen DNN success this week but keep in mind they were taking off before the massive spike this week and they have positive news to support their success. Some of it will sell off but it has plenty of room for growth.", "id": "lmgtid", "created_utc": 1613633082.0, "score": 36, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 75, "comments": [{"body": "Define undervalued.", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "Deep fucking undervalued", "score": 20, "replies": [{"body": "So basically a weird SEC case.", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.16314697265625}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6160478591918945}, {"body": "Less than my target price.", "score": 5, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2663966715335846}, {"body": "Anything less than 2x my cost.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.26056697964668274}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.15927962958812714}, {"body": "I got in this last week and looking for other tickers to expand in.

{"title": "Illegal Tactics and DTCC/Prime Broker Complicity In Naked Shorting & Retail Shutdown of Gee Em Eee (Read Ahead of 2/18 GameStop Congress Hearing) *Repost for Visibility*", "selftext": "*Note that the below text is a re-post of a previous post for visibility. If you've already read this would appreciate an upvote for visibility!*\n\n**TLDR: GameStop\u2019s Congress hearing is on Feb 18th, they need to investigate the Prime Brokers and DTCC for their complicity in enabling naked shorting within GME and by extension, potential collusion to shut down trading on Jan 28th, the day the short squeeze was going to kick off.** (stick to the end for an analysis of some illegal tactics short side hedge funds have been using)\n\nThesis: On the day the retail market for GME shut down on 1/28 (the day the short squeeze would\u2019ve happened had there been no market intervention), DTCC (clearing house monopoly) shut down retail buying in order to protect itself and Prime Brokers **(which privately own the DTCC)** from being exposed to the consequences of being party to illegal activity. I believe Prime Brokers and DTCC need to be called to the GameStop hearing on February 18th to be questioned for their complicity in enabling illegal naked shorting of the GME stock, as well as potential collusion to shut out retail buyers on 1/28.\n\nIn my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lglrg5/naked_shorting_in_gme_and_how_the_pieces_suddenly/) (which I recommend reading for some context) I explored the subject of rampant illegal naked shorting in GME, and how Prime Brokers (consisting of banks like Goldman, Morgan, etc) and DTCC would be complicit in the naked shorting. This in turn raises the thought experiment that they would be incentivized to do anything possible to prevent the short squeeze from happening on 1/28 because had the short squeeze happened, the shorts would go bankrupt and their Prime Brokers who lent them their naked shorted shares would need to cover the shares. This would not only represent a humongous capital expense for Prime Brokers, the culpability of Prime Brokers (and that of the DTCC) in this situation would also have likely been exposed as well.\n\nA quick primer on what a Prime Broker is: Prime Brokers are essentially the service side of the short- selling business. They lend out securities and cash, you can think of them as the \u201chouse\u201d in a casino: They provide a gambler with markers to play and to manage his winnings. According to Matt Taibi, \u201cUnder the original concept, if a hedge fund that wanted to short a stock they would first need to \u201clocate\u201d the stock with his Prime Broker but as time passed, Prime Brokers increasingly allowed their hedge-fund customers to use automated systems and \u201clocate\u201d the stock themselves, and what this does is enable short-sellers to sell stock without delivering and thereby perform naked shorts with counterfeit shares. (source: [https://web.archive.org/web/20210213125246/https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/wall-streets-naked-swindle-194908/](https://web.archive.org/web/20210213125246/https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/wall-streets-naked-swindle-194908/)). (I highly recommend you read[ Matt Taibi\u2019s article](https://web.archive.org/web/20210213125246/https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/wall-streets-naked-swindle-194908/) on naked shorting and how it was used to take down Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers. There are so many parallels with GME it\u2019s hard to miss. It\u2019s amazing to consider that 12 years after this article was published and brought to public awareness, the problem of naked shorting still exists as a systemic issue.)\n\nPrime Brokers have a long history of being associated with naked shorting. To highlight a few examples, Prime Brokers like Merill Lynch and Goldman have long been implicated for naked shorting Overstock.com ([https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/accidentally-released-and-incredibly-embarrassing-documents-show-how-goldman-et-al-engaged-in-naked-short-selling-244035/](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/accidentally-released-and-incredibly-embarrassing-documents-show-how-goldman-et-al-engaged-in-naked-short-selling-244035/), [https://www.forbes.com/2007/02/02/naked-short-suit-overstock-biz-cx\\_lm\\_0202naked.html?sh=271400d1763f](https://www.forbes.com/2007/02/02/naked-short-suit-overstock-biz-cx_lm_0202naked.html?sh=271400d1763f)). Another example is when Goldman\u2019s Prime Brokerage was implicated by the SEC in 2016 and got away with a small fine of 16 million (Source: [https://www.sec.gov/news/pressrelease/2016-9.html](https://www.sec.gov/news/pressrelease/2016-9.html)). An example that very recently came in the news is a story where CIBC, BOA, UBS and TD Bank Prime Brokerages are accused of facilitating naked short selling and using counterfeit stock to attack and bring the stock price of a company from $34.77 to $1.83 (Source: [https://www.securitiesfinancetimes.com/securitieslendingnews/industryarticle.php?article\\_id=224548](https://www.securitiesfinancetimes.com/securitieslendingnews/industryarticle.php?article_id=224548)).\n\nThe DTCC also has a very long history of being associated with naked shorting. The Wall Street Journal noted that 1% of the DTCC\u2019s volume end in failure to deliver which \u201c**have put DTCC in the middle of a long-running fight over whether unscrupulous investors are driving down hundreds of small companies' share prices\u2026 DTCC has turned a blind eye to the naked-shorting problem.** \u201d (Source: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720)). The DTCC has also had numerous complaints submitted to the SEC for enabling naked shorting (source: [https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/s72303/decosta122203.htm](https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/s72303/decosta122203.htm)) and have been sued tens or hundreds of times for assisting naked shorts (source: [https://smithonstocks.com/part-3-in-series-on-illegal-naked-shortings-role-in-stock-manipulation-prime-brokers-and-the-dtcc-have-a-troubling-monopoly-on-clearing-and-settling-stock-trades/](https://smithonstocks.com/part-3-in-series-on-illegal-naked-shortings-role-in-stock-manipulation-prime-brokers-and-the-dtcc-have-a-troubling-monopoly-on-clearing-and-settling-stock-trades/) and [http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html) and [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720))\n\nOn 1/28 Robinhood received a letter from the DTCC at 4 am requiring them to halt trading or come up with [3 billion dollars](https://fortune.com/2021/02/02/robinhood-gamestop-restricted-trading-meme-stocks-gme-amc-vlad-tenev-nscc/), which Robinhood did not have, and therefore with one swoop of the pen the DTCC shut down buy side momentum but strangely allowed selling. Retail investors were shut out of the market and as any student of microeconomics would know, by shutting buy but only allowing sell, the price is bound to fall. Meanwhile while hedge funds were able to keep trading not only in the market but also [crosstrade in the dark pools](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lghhkv/gamestop_institutional_broker_trades_off_the/) (\u201cprivate\u201d stock markets that retail is shut out of, more on this later), and use this crucial lifeline given to them by the DTCC to prevent the squeeze from happening that day.\n\nWith retail abruptly being shut out from buy (even cash accounts were shut out, which didn\u2019t make sense) and only allowed to sell, almost everyone could smell manipulation was afoot (which triggered the Congress hearing) and the most of the blame was pointed at Robinhood. Personally and in hindsight, I believe Robinhood was just a willing scapegoat. When we think about who had the most to lose if a short squeeze occurred, I\u2019ll narrow it down to three entities, Shorts and their stakeholders (ie Citadel), Prime Brokers and the DTCC.\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that the actual impetus that triggered the shutdown of the market for retail investors came from the DTCC. Working backwards, if you consider that GME was rampantly naked shorted and DTCC and Prime Brokers would have to be complicit in it, I believe the DTCC, Primer Brokers and possibly Citadel (who provides 40% of Robinhood\u2019s revenue) brazenly manipulated the market on 1/28 by shutting down purchasing for retail buyers to prevent the squeeze from being squoze on that day as doing so would be catastrophic for all aforementioned parties involved. **I believe that on the upcoming Gamestop Congress hearings the Financial Services Committee needs to call on decision makers of DTCC and Prime Brokers explore their role and complicity in the shut out of retail buyers that day as well as being enablers of naked shorting in GME.**\n\n**The main Prime Brokers (based on assets held under custodianship) of Melvin Capital are Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan** [**https://reports.adviserinfo.sec.gov/reports/ADV/173228/PDF/173228.pdf**](https://reports.adviserinfo.sec.gov/reports/ADV/173228/PDF/173228.pdf)**, all three firms sit on the board of the DTCC** [**https://www.dtcc.com/about/leadership/board**](https://www.dtcc.com/about/leadership/board)\n\nAn interesting thought experiment: On 1/28 when the price was 450+ and shorts were likely under 100, if we assume prime brokers allowed naked shorting in GME, then when the squeeze was about to happen (or happening), if Prime Brokers had margin had called the shorts, they would presumably also also gone down because shorts would not be able to pay in that event and the brokers would be holding the bag. By that logic, they have every incentive in this case to NOT to margin call and instead the most logical option would probably would have been to make a backroom deal, which is what I personally think most likely happened.\n\nIf you\u2019ve read up to this point, you might be thinking what can I do about this? I am aware that there a lot of cynicism that we can\u2019t do anything, that there will be no justice for retail investors who were harmed this situation, and that institutions and people in power will prevent anything from being done. I feel this sometimes too, but remember:\n\n**A single voice can be drowned out, but if we all speak together then we will make our voice heard. Ape Strong Together.**\n\nWith the hearing coming up on February 18th, I highly recommend you email and tweet the representatives involved in the hearing, as well as your own district representatives, and urge them to read into the factors presented in this post and **call the DTCC and Prime Brokers to the hearing**l. **They need to be questioned on why GME has so many counterfeit shares, failed to deliver, their complicity in naked shorting, and investigated for their role in the retail shut down of 1/28.** Below are 4 members of congress I recommend both tweeting and emailing\n\nHouse Financial Services Committee: [https://twitter.com/FSCDems](https://twitter.com/FSCDems) email: FSCDemsPress@[http://mail.house.gov/](http://mail.house.gov/)\n\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez [https://twitter.com/AOC](https://twitter.com/AOC), email: [us@ocasiocortez.com](mailto:us@ocasiocortez.com)\n\nAl Green [https://twitter.com/repalgreen](https://twitter.com/repalgreen), email: [al.green@mail.house.gov](mailto:al.green@mail.house.gov)\n\nMaxine Waters [https://twitter.com/maxinewaters](https://twitter.com/maxinewaters), email: [https://waters.house.gov/contact/email](https://waters.house.gov/contact/email)\n\nSenator Toomy [https://twitter.com/SenToomey](https://twitter.com/SenToomey), email: [https://www.toomey.senate.gov/contact/email-senator-toomey](https://www.toomey.senate.gov/contact/email-senator-toomey)\n\nNancy Pelosi Email: [https://twitter.com/SpeakerPelosi](https://twitter.com/SpeakerPelosi) email: [americanvoices@mail.house.gov](mailto:americanvoices@mail.house.gov)\n\nAnd you can find other members of Financial Services Committee here to reach out to: [https://financialservices.house.gov/about/committee-membership.htm](https://financialservices.house.gov/about/committee-membership.htm)\n\n*Edit (Adding based on a reader's comment): In your letter to your congressman, please ask to request the Congressional Research Service(CRS) to publish a report on the matter. CRS is Congress\u2019s private think tank. If they publish a report, IT WILL be read throughout the Hill, and taken more seriously than anything we could ever do as constituents*\n\nWhat follows should probably be a separate post, but I will take the opportunity to summarize some of the illegal tactics that shorts have been identified to be using in their war with retail investors. Note that this may not be an exhaustive list and there may be newer tactics deployed in the future. Retail investors might not have the same tricks, resources and willingness to break the law for profit as hedgies do, but my hope and belief is that if we pool our knowledge and analysis, we will figure out their game and effectively adapt.\n\nFeel free to forward the list below to any representatives and lawmakers if you concur that these tactics were used:\n\n**Rampant Naked Shorting -** With the [extremely high number of Fail to Delivers (FTID](http://www.wherearetheshares.com/)) , [short interest being as high as 226% recently](https://imgur.com/fN4fVQl), [and institutions alone holding a staggering 177% of the total float](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le235t/gme_institutions_hold_177_of_float_why_the) (likely due in large part to counterfeit shares), signs strongly point to GME being rampant with naked shorts and counterfeit shares. I believe the original goal of shorts was to drive GME to bankruptcy with these naked shorts, using [the laddering of naked shorts](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lf4vn3/yes_laddering_is_real_short_ladder_attack_is_just/) (aka short ladder attack), executed with the help of counterfeit stock which is a classic and reliable method of driving down the stock price. I believe the GME stock has seen relentlessly aggressive short attacks, especially on the week of Monday February 1st, which drove the stock price down and triggered panic selling.\n\n**Masking Shorts with by Shorting ETFs that hold GME** (Can't link due to WSB, will put in comments)\n\n**Ladder Attacks with the help of Dark Pools** \\- Another identified method of ladder attacks was identified to come from [crosstrading with darkpools (the stock market has its own private stock exchange where institutions can trade\u2026)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lghhkv/gamestop_institutional_broker_trades_off_the/). Essentially darkpools are private stock markets retail investors do not have access to, where short side funds can purchase securities \u201coff market\u201d and then sell \u201con-market\u201d, with the effect of creating a lot more downward pressure on the market without the upward pressure from buying.\n\n**Illegally masking shorts with synthetic longs**. Another tactic shorts are suspected of using in GME is the use of illegally using options to evade short positions in violation of Reg SHO which SEC describes in [this risk alert](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2013-151) and which I elaborate in this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered/). Essentially it\u2019s the use of using options to create synthetic longs to illegally and artificially cover and prolong short positions and at same time obscuring the true short interest %. If you consider that it would be far more profitable for shorts to not cover at high prices but instead ladder attack the price and wait for retail investors to lose interest and close their shorts at as low of a price as possible, then you can see why this strategy would be very effective.\n\n**Using way out-of-money call options to obscure true short interest.** You may have heard about the 43 million worth of 800 dollar calls purchased when the price was 100 and found it odd. Later it was identified as a tactic to cheaply purchase synthetic call options (since at 800 its way out of money) to obscure their short positions (with the added benefit of hedging at 800 if a squeeze does happen)\n\nOne thing I want to note, particularly to legislators at the GameStop hearing: Retail investors were not incited to pump GME. **Retail investors spotted a unique Short Squeeze opportunity created by the greed of short side hedge funds**, whereby GameStop was being abusively naked shorted with the goal of bringing it to bankruptcy, and hedge funds were so greedy about it that they shorted the company with a short interest of 226% of float, meaning A LOT of counterfeit shares were being used to short the company. **Retail investors saw this as an opportunity to short squeeze the hedge fund shorters, which is a legal and legitimate investment strategy**. The short squeeze would have happened had everyone played fair, but instead, financial institutions who were culpable to the naked shorting intervened and shut down retail buying, hurting the retail investors and successfully manipulating the market. The investment itself was in my opinion a sound decision based on the short squeeze, but in hindsight retail investors did not seriously consider the risk of the market would be blatantly and publicly manipulated and that the market would be rigged against them.\n\nIf this post was useful (and I hope it was! Gave up my Friday night to write this for you Apes), please upvote for visibility and share it far and wide. **The GameStop hearings could be a first step and hope towards legislative change, and it\u2019s extremely important that the right story is told at those hearings (and by the right story I mean the real truth of what happened**.) I hope the truly culpable parties are investigated and brought to justice. Again, I know many of us feel cynical that anything meaning will be done towards finding justice against the lawbreakers in this case, but **if you feel even an ounce of injustice or empathy at how retail investors were unfairly harmed in the course of investing in GME, I strongly urge you to contact a legislator associated with the GameStop hearings and bring this to their attention so they can review this case with more complete information. In addition I recommend you to contact the SEC and any journalist you know or via journalist tip lines. It\u2019s not going to be easy but the more awareness we raise the higher the likelihood our voices will be heard and positive change will be made.**\n\nPs.

They are fine paying the fines. It\u2019s what keeps this going. \n\nAn article that came out recently is calls for more regulations over  clearings houses and blaming them for the restrictions but in trades recently. THIS IS FALSE. Please read and share. \n\nThis is our one chance to force congress to fix the rigged markets...\n\nThe agencies that regulate the markets:\n\nBrokers - the SEC\nMarket makers - the NASB\nCleaning houses - doesn\u2019t matter \nHedge Funds - FINRA\n\nWhat I learned from Google. \n\nA Market makers role in the markets has changed over the years. But their main purpose is to provide liquify to the market. So they are there to buy what wants to be sold and sell what wants to be bought. They set the bit and ask prices and control the spread between them. This is how they make money and is justified by the amount of risk they take on. Therefore, they have ZERO fiduciary responsibility and not required to operate with the investor\u2019s best interest (like brokers are). So they can definitely  manipulate the price of a stock.\n\nTwo other things MM do blew my fucking mind and set sirens and alarms off in head. This was the first... what the fucking fuck moment. MM also provide *some* liquify to the options market. And they are allowed to manage their inventory. I honestly don\u2019t know which one is worse. If this isn\u2019t perfect storm situation to guarantee fraud, I don\u2019t know what is. I almost forgot and this part. They are allowed to buy and sell from their own inventory to make a profit also. Lol Smfh so they can easily tank a stocks price or make people think there is more activity than there really is. Probably no manipulation here though.. more likely to find people manipulating markets on Reddit. \n\nClearing houses take on no risks. They will only accept trades that offset due to the time it takes settle. This would support the argument that market makers do have a purpose in our markets. They take on the risk to provide liquidity... and why they are allowed to make money from the spread in the buy and the ask price. \n\nWhen I googled hedge funds, I had another what the fucking fuck moment. Hedge funds invest in riskier investments (shorting stocks and derivatives). What blew my mind is they have no reporting obligation to anyone on how they make money. It could be a madoff Ponzi scheme and no disclosure. \n\nRemember vladfag making multiple comments when he wasn\u2019t even asked saying no relationship between citadel and robinhood? Of course one doesn\u2019t own the other. That would be illegal. They def had relationship.. maybe it\u2019s not the hedge fund citadel, but the market maker citadel is routed a majority of robinhood\u2019s trade. I heard him mention multiple times and was never asked once so it seemed sketch. \n\nSo meeting with congress tomorrow:\n\n-DFV\n-Reddit CEO\n-Robinhood douche \n-Citadel HF \n-Melvin Capital HF\n\nWho\u2019s not required to go talk to congress to answer questions:\n\n-Market makers\n-Cleaning houses \n\n1)  unless it\u2019s to defend DFV, wtf information is Reddit ceo going to provide to congress to help them understand what happened in markets?!\n2) if clearing houses are to blame or and need more regulations, why the fuck are they attending or asked to explain any details? Bc vlad explained it so clearly? \n3) DID EVERYONE FORGET ABOUT THE MARKET MAKER?!?!? \n\nIf MM take on the risk and are there to sell what wants to be sold and buy what wants to be purchase, where the fuck were they for GameStop? Yes a clearing house has a reserve requirement... but robinhood also restricted instant deposit limits that week and max instant deposit you could use to trade was $1000. So the restrictions were should have nothing to do with trading activity, bc MM take on the risk. You can\u2019t have margin on a $1k account. I know this bc I had two diff clients mention it. They weren\u2019t trying to get in on the action after trades were restricted.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t make sense reserve reserve req being raised. That\u2019s what MM are for. So they can just abandon their position in making markets operate smoothly and no recourse? They don\u2019t even take the blame for any of it?!?! And no one mentions them once?!??? Seems like they are trying to protect or shield the MMs. \n\nI learned the broker that dicked me last week (td - do not use - see recent lawsuit - same thing happened last week but they got sloppy as fuck and what started me looking into this bc I wanted to know who exactly was fuckingg me) works with a single MM. so I decided to Google who what MM robinhood uses. Apparently this is how they offer free trading. They route trades to whoever pays more. But the majority of them go through citadel market maker. Another what the fucking fuck moment. \n\nSo there is a citadel hedge fund and a citadel market maker. They might be legally two separate entities but they def comMunicate. One invests in only derivatives and short stocks. And the other one makes the market and is allowed to accumulate inventory of stock. That doesn\u2019t seem right or just doesn\u2019t sit well. Who could make a killing off on options if you had a connection with someone who is legally allowed to manipulate stock price?! \n\nSo to circle back to the beginning... and who regulates each:\n\nBrokers - the SEC\nMarket makers - the NASB\nCleaning houses - doesn\u2019t matter \nHedge Funds - FINRA\n\n-SEC is a government organization and has oversight on brokers.\n-FINRA is a for profit corporation \n\nAnd NASB who has oversight on the real market manipulators... is a self-regulated oversight board. \n\nWho trusts this oversight?! My last what the fuxking fuck moment. Who the fuck would think this is an effective way to regulate \u201cfree\u201d markets? How has this been allowed still and it\u2019s 2021? \n\nThe reason retail investors will always be fucked. It\u2019s like the institutions at the forefront shield the people behind the scenes and manipulate the markets and tied to the hedge funds who don\u2019t have to report how they make money to anyone. \n\nThe reason nothing has ever been done about it.... money influences politics. One side more than the other. The SEC investigated this almost 30 years ago and issued a report on their finding which market makers sucks dick pretty much. The self reg oversight promised to do better. \ud83d\ude44 this was before computer system like we have now. And why trades are directed to or should be directed to best available price on market. Lol td actually didn\u2019t this recently and it threw me off so bad because price was a lot less than what I entered to pay. I was so confused.\n\nMarket makers serve no purpose in markets (except otc). They provide no benefit (not even 30 years ago). They can\u2019t be relied on to do their job and provide liquify. They clearly work with both the hedge funds and brokers in abusive transactions to fuckk retail investors. They actually don\u2019t even take on the risk bc they operate with almost no money. Their sole purpose is to rigged the markets. Something else has liquidity withoht need MM. \n\nThe SEC is there to protect investors. But doesn\u2019t have authority over who creates the unfair advantage in the markets. \n\nMake congress act!", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "Holy shit.

{"title": "FYI for people new to the VIX and VIX ETFs, before you go balls deep.", "selftext": "Hello retards. Last week I made [a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/liaxu1/600m_in_inflows_to_uvxy_in_the_past_4_days_is/) regarding a Bloomberg article indicating that there was a large inflow into the UVXY ETF to discuss what it means for the market. The general gist of the discussion was that either a lot of traders were buying UVXY to hedge an expected correction or that hedge funds were borrowing shares to short, indicating an expectation of calm waters on the horizon. Bloomberg assumed that latter last week but has since [changed its mind](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-17/reddit-is-chief-suspect-as-volatility-etf-swells-to-2-6-billion), postulating that it was WSB.\n\nWhile I still don't know what the volume means, I did see a lot of comments on the post that indicated that a shocking number of you people know absolutely nothing about the VIX or the VIX ETFs many of you are YOLOing. Some of the misconceptions I saw included \"lol okay gay bear\" and \"I just bought 3000 shares, looks like this is the bottom\". Both of these comments imply that you people have no idea what UVXY is and are going to lose a bunch of money if it is in fact the retail investor driving its inflows.\n\nFirst of all, the large inflows into UVXY, as I have said multiple times, do not mean people are betting on the market to fall. It could mean the opposite as it could mean hedge funds are borrowing shares to sell short and are therefore betting on the ETF to drop due to further volatility decrease.\n\nAnother thing is that the price of UVXY and VXX is not inherently bearish for a number of reasons. The first being that UVXY doesn't literally track the VIX and follow the price up or down like SPY or QQQ. UVXY is not comprised of stocks like an index fund. It is comprised of futures positions with an average maturity of 1 month and is 1.5x leveraged. Futures positions are similar to options in that they are a degrading asset. If the futures contracts bought by this fund expire below the price they were bought at, the fund realizes those losses and is then buying futures positions with a smaller money pool. Exposure in these funds is reset daily, which means that it is on autopilot buying and selling futures contracts with undeployed funds each day to maintain an average 30 day maturity leveraged 1.5x.\n\nThis means that trying to apply any type of technical analysis, chart pattern analysis, etc. to UVXY is fucking worthless. The fund does not have support or resistance levels and this is not a long-term hold. Funds like this constantly do reverse splits to bring share price and options price back to more tradeable levels. For those of you who are newer to the market, there was once a 2x leveraged VIX fund called TVIX that shut down because it ran out of money. I also want to make something very clear since there's speculation that hedge funds are buying UVXY to short. THIS IS NOT THE SAME AS GME and AMC. You cannot short squeeze UVXY. ETFs are different from stocks in that market makers can issue new shares to meet demand. The feedback loop that caused the\u00a0gamma squeeze in GME would not be possible unless the issuer of the ETF halted creation of new shares. It is entirely possible to lose every penny you put into UVXY if you hold indefinitely. \n\nThe fund also doesn't necessarily rise and fall with the VIX. Over the summer, VXX and UVXY fell as the VIX went up on a pretty consistent basis. This was when Softbank was buying a bunch of calls and driving up options premiums. Even though the VIX was going up, VIX futures did not do so because there was not a strong expectation that the VIX was going to spike over the course of the following months. The fund makes money due to sharp volatility increases such as during a correction, when the underlying VIX increases 10%+ on a single day. The fund does not make money when there is sustained, relatively high volatility. You can [go here](https://www.proshares.com/funds/uvxy_daily_holdings.html) to look at what contracts UVXY is currently holding. Currently, it has March and April contracts in a proportion that exposes it to an average 1-month maturity.\n\nIf you do want to buy this fund based on historic VIX support and resistance levels and a bet that a correction is coming soon, you need to look at the actual VIX, which cannot itself be traded. Currently, the real VIX is at 23.76, at around the area it was at the end of February 2020 before the market crash. At that time, UVXY was at about $15.00 per share. Right now UVXY is near all time lows, but the VIX itself is still elevated relative to historical standards. In October 2017, the VIX went as low as 9, less than half of current levels, and the price of UVXY was still around $15.00 per share. If you think the VIX is irrationally at a historical bottom, you're wrong. It is near the bottom of a range it has been fluctuating between for the last 6-9 months, which is roughly 20-40.\n\nIn order to understand the supports and resistances of the VIX you need to understand what comprises the VIX.  The VIX \"measures fear and uncertainty\" by aggregating the premium people are paying for OTM options on S&P500 stocks. The idea is that demand, and therefore price, for OTM options contracts goes up if people are hedging more in either direction. This is how the VIX went up during a bull run over the summer. The market, especially retail investors, were willing to pay more for options premiums and demand was especially high due in part to SoftBank's aggressive call buying. The VIX also spikes during corrections because the demand for puts goes up. People don't know how deeply they have to hedge during a correction and will pay up for puts way OTM. That's why VIX spikes are generally, but not necessarily, considered bearish.\n\nSo the best way you can use the VIX isn't necessarily by buying into VIX ETFs like UVXY. Instead, one might want to use it as an indicator for buying or selling SPY. For example, since the VIX is near a support level right now, one might bet on it bouncing off that support in a broad selloff or breaking through that support as the economy continues to recover. You can also look at the VVIX, the derivative of the VIX, to get an idea of how fast options premiums are changing at a given time. VVIX will rally as options premiums go up or down and generally indicates that people are repositioning. A peak in VVIX indicates that repositioning is done and can precede the last leg of a trend. VVIX will go down as people hold their positions and wait for things to play out.\n\nEdit (2/19) - TLDR:\n\n1. VIX ETFs are not the same as the VIX. You cannot buy the VIX. ETFs track VIX futures and are not a diamond hands play - you can lose every penny (see TVIX). Look at the real VIX to determine entry/exit points.\n\n\n2. Now isn't a horrible time to play UVXY or another VIX ETF. The actual VIX is [near the bottom](http://imgur.com/gallery/85Ys3WH) of its recent trading range and looks to be close to an inflection point. \n\n\n3. The VVIX, VIX's derivative and retarded cousin, just saw a big spike but [looks to have peaked](https://imgur.com/gallery/vucgyLm) based on the past 2 days. If VVIX goes down again today (2/19) a big VIX move will probably wait until VVIX bottoms. VVIX essentially measures the speed at which options premiums are changing and spikes as the market repositions. \n\n\n4. The VIX can be a useful tool.  If you want to learn some tricks on how to use/interpret/understand the VIX, read the text wall above.\n\n\n5. There is evidence UVXY is being heavily shorted right now, which is interesting, but UVXY is not vulnerable to a short squeeze and the VIX cannot be directly manipulated.\n\nUpdate (3/5) - The past few weeks have confirmed my suspicion that the VIX ETFs are shitty, broken hedge instruments that clearly don't work in this environment and that the strategy of rebalancing 30 day futures positions daily is fucking retarded.

There are a lot of smart people on here. \n\nI agree that SPY puts are more efficient, especially with the VIX ETFs at such a low price. If you buy UVXY $10 strike calls, and UVXY doubles to $20, your play on day of expiration still only makes you $1000 per contract. On the other hand, if you buy SPY $380 puts, and SPY sees a 10% correction from current levels, you make $3900 per contract. This, in addition to the issues with VIX futures, make SPY a way better way to make a hedge using options.\n\nI think UVXY is better used as a hedge if you simply buy shares. I use it in one of my accounts and it makes up anywhere from 5% to 20% of the portfolio's holdings depending on how I'm feeling about the short-term outlook. Right now it's at 12% because while I think we're probably due for a correction, I don't know for sure and I think it would only be a 5% rather than a crazy 20% crash.

Sorry if a dumb question trying to learn", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Yes. But \"volatility\" is a loosely defined word. The VIX will increase if options premiums increase and decrease if those premiums go down. \n\nLook at a stock like GME. Currently, a $950 call with an expiration in January 2022 is $200. That means you're paying $200 for a call that makes money only on a 2,000% gain. That is a giant time premium. So we would consider GME extremely volatile. \n\nNow look at SIRI. A $4 call that expires in January costs $200 and requires only a 5% gain. That's practically no time premium. You basically just need SIRI to not go down over the next year. So we would consider SIRI very low in volatility. \n\nThat doesn't necessarily mean the $4 SIRI call is a better play than the $950 GME call. I've held SIRI stock since 2017 and it barely moves while any number of crazy things could happen to cause GME to skyrocket. That's why people are willing to pay up for GME calls. \n\nSo the VIX takes the time premium we're talking about for options of all S&P500 stocks and comes up with a number that reflects, generally, how high the time premium of the market is at a given time. If SPY is moving 0.1% per day that probably means time premium is pretty low on options and therefore the VIX will be low. If SPY is moving 5%+ per day like it was last March then the VIX will be very high because there's no telling what the price could be going forward, causing a big time premium. \n\nYou can see, then, how one can make assumptions about \"uncertainty\" or \"volatility\" based on what time premiums are doing. It's a pretty decent measurement but it's imperfect. And since VIX ETFs are based on VIX futures and not the VIX itself, they are an even less accurate measurement of volatility.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["vix"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["vix"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "All volatility stocks are hard to track because they gain by your option loses.. if everyone win their options this stock would be at $0", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.43421557545661926}, {"body": "In VIX ETFs right now?

I was neutral when I wrote this post but the last few weeks have affirmed my suspicion that they're completely broken. The strategy of buying futures then rebalancing daily clearly doesn't work in the current market environment and the method the VIX uses to measure volatility is clearly broken with everybody and their mother trading options and stabilizing premium now. The realized losses that resulted from the rebalance shrunk the upside of the ETFs and the relatively high level that the VIX has stabilized at makes an ernest spike close to impossible. The midterm ETFs or XVZ look way better than the short term ones right now but I'd rather just so a -3x leveraged fund like SQQQ or FNGD to hedge.
