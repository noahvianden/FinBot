{"title": "Is There Anything Better Than The wheel Strategy?", "selftext": "I've searched and scoured the internet and reddit for option strategies, and one of the best I've came across throughout my life is \"The Wheel Strategy\", If you don't know what that is, I wrote a brief explanation: \n\nThe goal is to collect premium while selling Cash covered puts \\*on a stock you don't mind owning and paying the strike for\\*, trying not to get assigned, this is basically income. If you do get assigned you buy x shares (hopefully at a favorable price) then you can now sell Covered calls on the x shares. I try to go for stocks with high IV for better premiums but you do you, a good place to start would probably be with AAPL. (NIO has some good premiums)\n\nLets use TSLA as it is currently trading @ 853 and you think that 800 is a good buy, you sell a Cash Covered Put for a strike of 800, 30 DTE, and collect a premium of around 3.2k, which is basically an instant 4% return on 80k, if you don't get assigned you can keep selling puts until you do (free money) which can lead up to insane returns if done right. Now, if you do get assigned then you can finally sell Covered Calls. If you want a higher chance of selling the stock for a higher premium then go for close strikes, and if you want to hold on to the stock and milk every penny from selling Covered Calls go for far strikes, like Jan 21 2022 1035 call, you can get around a 19k premium and its around 10 months DTE. \n\nBe sure to select the right stocks while using this method as nothing is guaranteed.\n\nIf you guys know any good strategies I can use, I am looking to learn a few, especially with options decay; theta (I love it)", "id": "ldnyo7", "created_utc": 1612579017.0, "score": 43, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 71, "comments": [{"body": "[removed]", "score": 17, "replies": [{"body": "why do you need to buy the ETFs with this?", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.11433874070644379}, {"body": "Can you explain \"weekly at the money call spread son SPY\"?

The underlying's fundamentals are good enough to be not afraid of being assigned. ie You did the DD and the case is built that the stock is a sound investment **right now;** it's even expected to rise in the very near future.\n2. Buy the dip: This is where your CSP kick's it. We never buy anywhere aside from the dip because. see #3. For options, it's best during low volatility.\n3. a) If you weren't not assigned: free money in your pocket for doing a great DD on your underlying. \n4. b) If you get assigned, then well and good because: profit is made during the buy and not the sale.

If your calls were assigned, then it just proves that your DD strategy is just damn great and this is actually where you earn your money and not the trading.\n6. Repeat\n\nThe errors that we typically see are the following:\n\n1. Lack of due diligence. This typically leads to being afraid (in secret) of being assigned. Fix: make your DD until you find a stock that you love (unemotionally).\n2. Buying too big of underlying stock that the cost basis for a single trade ties up too much of the overall portfolio. ie Tying up too much of the capital. This one also typically leads to being afraid (in secret) of being assigned. Fix: size your CSP underlying accordingly. Don't CSP on AAPL that if it gets assigned it will tie up a big chunk/ majority of the capital. We all love the famous companies of course, but for a typical small retail investor lets' stick with the small caps companies instead for now.\n3.

I cut my losses on that one and the following week I made that money back. A week later GME, KOSS, and AMC took that account to new levels.\n\nAnd on that note I have a suggestion, take it or leave it. I personally use 2 accounts. Primary with webull bc it allows for 4x leveraged day trades. Secondary with Robinhood. \n\nMy primary account sees no speculative action. The majority of my net worth is in there and I count on that portfolio to provide for me. I hardly ever hold margin overnight to keep my stress low. Hardly ever will it see a company worth less than $10bn fair value. Hardly ever will it see a company that isn't deep value with 20% or more near term upside. Example: Qualcomm dipped like 9% in after hours a few days ago. I put about 1200 on it. Next day dipped a few percent more, put about another 1200 in it. Qualcomm WILL go back up and I will bet my future on that.\n\nMy Robinhood account on the other hand, pure speculation and higher risk. BB, NOK, AMC, GME were purchased here. About $300 on each, luckily right before it hit the news. But even then it was less then half the total value of that account. I can put a few hundred on a long shot and wait until it pays out. If it tanks it doesn't matter because my exposure isn't too serious. This account is less than 20% of my net worth. I am prepared to lose this money but still I play it within reason. When meme stocks hit the news it was obviously he time to start exiting and enjoy the win.\n\nThe two account method works for me anyways, just an idea.

{"title": "Nio dd for people who actually wanna trade a stock that won\u2019t go bankrupt", "selftext": "Now that we have 8.6 million degens here it\u2019s time to discuss the bull case for my favorite stock.... NIO\n\nChinese Tesla has treated me extremely well this year and I\u2019m PROMISING you guys that we will see growth to 100 per share before the end of the year. \n\nMy bull case....\ud83d\ude80\n\nEV craze has just begun. The world is slowly integrating itself into a place devoid of combustion engines. As much as I love the sound and performance of a combustion engine I just don\u2019t think they\u2019ll be around for to much longer. With that, integration of a green new deal will completely change the US regulatory systems regarding emissions. The Green New Deal is a congressional resolution that lays out a grand plan for tackling climate change.\n\nIntroduced by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Senator Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts, both Democrats, the proposal calls on the federal government to wean the United States from fossil fuels and curb planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions across the economy. It also aims to guarantee new high-paying jobs in clean energy industries.\n\nThat beings said, trade tariffs will be decreased under Biden with China. This will allow for easier Chinese exports of cars, such as vehicles from nio, to be introduced to the United States.\n\nChinese are said to be posturing to win EV over by setting a 2025 goal to make 20 percent of its auto sales plug-in hybrids or battery-powered electric vehicles (EVs). China has around 240 million passenger vehicles today meaning that 48 million of them would be EV by 2025. \n\nDeliveries have been insanely good. Breaking records in a constant uptrend for the past year.... they\u2019re aiming for 120000 deliveries in 2021 which is 274% greater than this year\u2019s 43,728 deliveries. \n\nThey\u2019ve integrated some of the best new tech into new vehicles including... the NVIDIA DRIVE Orin\u2122 system-on-a-chip (SoC) for its new generation of electric vehicles, which will offer advanced automated driving capabilities.\n\nNIO is working to make consumer adoption of smart, performance-packed electric vehicles a widespread reality. At NIO Day, the company\u2019s annual customer event, the EV maker revealed its NVIDIA DRIVE Orin-powered supercomputer, dubbed Adam, which will first appear in the ET7 sedan that will ship in China starting in 2022. NIO was the first to put the 1,000km range on its ET7 sedan specification, to be fitted with a 150kWh solid-state battery when it goes into production in 2022. This KILLS TESLA. \n\nCameras also kill Tesla....NIO Aquila Super Sensing features 33 high-performance sensing units including an ultralong-range high-resolution LiDAR, 11 8MP high-resolution cameras, enhanced driver monitoring system, 5 millimeter wave radars, 12 ultrasonic sensors, redundant high-precision localization units and V2X. It redefines the standards of autonomous driving sensing systems.\n\nNIO BANK PRICE TARGETS\n\nMorgan Stanley 80\n\nJ.P.

{"title": "BB: My totally not made up girlfriend who lives in Canada", "selftext": "This is not financial advice or an attempt to convince you to buy. I am merely sharing an opportunity I believe exists because the market has not yet come around to how BB has repositioned itself.  \n\nThere\u2019s also better DD on Blackberry than this and if you\u2019re interested you should search it. \n\n**TL;DNR why BB?**\n\n1. Because they are a key player in the ridiculously lucrative software fields of advanced AI, cyber security and autonomous vehicles. \n\n2. Because they are criminally undervalued based on their partnerships and future prospects (more below). \n\n3. Because there is value. This is not GME, there won\u2019t be another GME. But like GME in the fall when shorts didn\u2019t understand the gaming cycle, there is a gap between prevailing opinion and reality. \n\n**Don\u2019t they make boomer phones?**\n\nNo. They don\u2019t make *any* phones. In fact they sold all of their phone patents to Huawai. They have completely reinvented themselves as a software company and are on the cusp of a monumental turnaround. \n\n**Wait, so what do they do? (This part is IMPORTANT)**\n\nSoftware. And not just any software, but software that the market generally values extraordinarily high. \n\nThey are about to be dominant in automobile operating systems. Seriously. Blackberry. As u/gangusgun pointed out their QNX OS is in more than 175 million cars. They inked a deal with Baidu to develop their autonomous vehicle. They inked a deal with Amazon to develop and market BlackBerry's \"Intelligent Vehicle Data Platform\". They inked a deal with Sony to provide the basis for their EV. Their integrated system will be mass-produced and available on Guangzhou Automobile Group electric vehicle arm\u2019s upcoming GAC New Energy Aion models. GAC has a joint venture with NIO. \n\n19 out of 25 EV companies currently use QNX. **With GM and others moving away from ICE in the near future who do you think they\u2019re going to partner with? Mother. Fucking. Blackberry.**\n\nAmazon. Baidu. NIO. Sony. (And SpaceX but that\u2019s unrelated to cars). Do these seem like bad companies run by stupid people to you?\n\nAnd yet, the market is still valuing this stock as if it\u2019s making phones, rather than being the eyes and ears of every vehicle on the road. As u/forshakuras pointed out in their DD that you should really read if you have any interest in the company, BB is valued at $6.5B despite $475M in recurring revenue and 26% year over year growth. Similar companies that have had slightly better growth but perhaps not as bright of a future (my opinion, not his) are valued at 8 times as much. \n\n**But it\u2019s still just a meme stock right?**\n\nI\u2019m not judging GME or AMC. You can see from my comment history that I have been talking about GME for a really long time. But GME was a fling. BB is not a company that sells physical games that no one buys in 6,000 stores that no one goes to. And while I think AMC could have a monster summer if people feel safe going to the movies it still has crippling debt and a fundamentally changed market where direct to consumer releases are now a thing. \n\nBB got caught up with those companies because it\u2019s viewed as wsb \u2018tards making nostalgic picks. *Which proves my point that people don\u2019t yet get what\u2019s happening with BB.*\n\nBB is not a fling. It\u2019s not based on a squeeze. It\u2019s just a really, really good company that will steadily rise and could have occasional massive pops (consider the 65% increase the day their amzn deal went public). \n\n**Conclusion**\n\nMy girlfriend lives in Canada. She is a smoking hot model but no one knows that yet. So ima lock her up. Shares.
