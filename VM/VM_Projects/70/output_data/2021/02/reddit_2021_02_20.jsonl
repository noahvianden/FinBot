{"title": "Which automaker will be the MSFT of EV?", "selftext": "I am a big believer in EV, and I think we will see amazing innovation within the industry and faster than expected adoption. In the end, EV is an inevitable part of the green agenda. But how can we as investors capitalize on this trend without jumping into interestingly valued companies and EV startups. \n\nYes, I am aware of Tesla and a ton of other EV companies with huge rockets behind their stock price. I have had positions in those companies. However, I can\u2019t wrap my head around the fact that some investors believe that traditional automakers are out of the game. Some people make it sound like they are sitting on their hands watching their market share disappear. Moreover, investors are investing like it will be a winner takes all market. That\u2019s not gonna happen. \n\nNow, back to the title of this post and my original question. Which automaker will be the MSFT of EV companies?\n\nIf any of you remember Steve Ballmer and pre-Nadella times at MSFT. Cloud and SaaS was the name of the game, and MSFT was lagging heavily. All the cool kids on the block looked down on MSFT with comments like: \u201cThey have too much legacy, they can\u2019t turn the ship around\u201d. Well, they did. From 30 ish stock price to 240 today. Their future has never looked brighter. So, I feel the same sentiment towards traditional automakers and the EV revolution. But one of them will surely do a MSFT move, but which one?

To act like some of the companies you noted are just going to roll over and die is absolutely brain-dead, and to act like they're not catching up is also brain-dead. There's news articles every week about this or that manufacturer making advances in their EV technology. I'm a mechanic, I work on Mercedes and have prior experience working on other euro cars at an independent shop previous so the euro luxury market is what I'm most familiar with.\n\nFirst of all Mercedes has a brand where price is not a concern. If it costs Mercedes more than others to make and deliver a proper EV, does it matter? People are already paying \\~100K for a fairly bland GLS at this point. People are REGULARLY paying 120-150k for all kinds of AMG SUVs and cars. 180k-220k for a GWagon or Sclass? Sell it to me baby. People don't care about money or if they do, have so much of it they don't care about the price tag. I think this gives Mercedes an advantage over some of the other companies.\n\n* OTA; Now all the TSLA bulls love to yell about how cool their over the air updates are, but Mercedes has been able to do OTA updates for years for some of the trivial stuff like map updates. You can also already pull a bunch of info OTA... so whats the logical next step? [Accessing more control modules and updating those OTA similar to TSLA.](https://media.daimler.com/marsMediaSite/en/instance/ko/Over-the-air-updates-become-upgrades-at-Mercedes-Benz-Always-up-to-date-Mercedes-Benz-vehicles-are-constantly-learning-over-the-air.xhtml?oid=48822484)\n\n>The next step in the update strategy of Mercedes-Benz comes with the new S-Class. Its electronics architecture allows over-the-air updating of more than 50 control units in the vehicle and of the entire MBUX system, including the central display, without a workshop visit.\n\n* Data; People also love to talk about the head start TSLA has with their data collection which may or may not be true, but to act like Mercedes or other companies are incapable and/or not collecting data is insane. Here is is from the horses mouth. When did they start collecting data? [I have no clue, but here's Mercedes AR navigation setup. I'm sure they're not collecting massive amounts of data with this! /s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=53&v=44myNm8T1Vw&feature=youtu.be)\n\n>Connections of this kind are impossible without a reliable flow of data, and the same is true of automated functions within the vehicle as well as the autonomously driving vehicles of the future. [Sajjad Khan, Executive Vice President and Member of the Divisional Board of Mercedes-Benz Cars](https://www.daimler.com/magazine/mobility/sustainability-data-security-mobility.html), CASE, has no doubt: \u201cIn order to successfully participate in shaping the mobility of the future, knowledge about data and their use is at least as important as knowledge about drivetrains.\u201d\n\n* Luxury and tech; I suppose this is subjective and perhaps I'm biased, but Mercedes while becoming cheaper and cheaper I still find them to be nicer than a TSLA. I say this as someone who has experience working on Porsche, TSLA, Audi, BMW, Mercedes. I see them all upon trade in, I drive them, work on them, and so fourth. TSLA's are cheap and plagued with issues and I expect this to continue. Why? Because they need to massively scale their business. Corners and costs will be cut. Why buy this wood trim when you can get this 95% similar synthetic wood for less? Mercedes and probably every other OEM is doing the same thing but unless you're buying the cheap A and B classes I'm going to give them the edge here. The Autonomous driving is still in favor of TSLA, but given the things I highlighted above that is and will continue to shrink. The Mercedes cars will do excellently autonomously driving on the freeway...just don't try to let it take you off an off ramp. I try every time for my own research purposes, no dice, don't try that at home kids. TSLA wins here fore sure. The overall tech and infotainment setup Mercedes has will be matching TSLA with their next gen cars, but I don't think a giant fucking tablet is cool, so both suck (imo)\n* EV; I know I wrote a novel to get to this point and this is the thesis of your question, but its the one I have the least amount of knowledge in. TSLA is crushing people here, but Mercedes is making strides and I think their customers are too. You know how many EQ hybrid vehicles I saw or did a PDI on during my first year? Not many. You know how many EQ hybrid vehicles I saw come in during my second year? Tons and tons and tons. I'd say about a 1/3rd of the compact SUVs (GLC) I see are EQ Hybrids. T[hey have and are committing to EV vehicles, and their EQC has seen very high demand in Europe and they are already building a plant in China](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a30756029/mercedes-sustainable-mobility/). They state the demand has delayed the NA release, not sure about the truth behind that statement but alas. They already have distribution networks and supply chains and of course, already thousands upon thousands of dealerships and service centers worldwide, TSLA will need more \"stores\" or whatever they're calling them. So while TSLA expands, traditional companies just need to let their engineers do their thing and their time will come. Bonus for making it this far so [here's a cool video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bzX-HQgsL8&feature=emb_title) and [another](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMSnmvQqwWk) (Note he also talks interior quality as I mentioned) and [another](https://youtu.be/G7QiY5CvIXU?t=33). Not exactly a shit tier EQ and it was their first. Mercedes range puts them within \\~30 miles of the range on the model Y unless I'm mistaken which isn't bad? These cars are already probably taking away TSLA customers as they had almost a monopoly on the space prior, every car sold to a rival may be a loss of sale to them. They will continue to take market sphere, so will every other auto manufacturer, how people ignore this I have no clue, its the most logical conclusion you could make by applying some basic critical thinking. Do I know and think Mercedes will be a leader in the space? I have no clue, I'm not super into EV cars, but I know damn well they and other companies will all continue to move into the market. Why the fuck would they not? They have the resources and if anyone is capable of hiring good engineers, you damn well know it'll be the Germans.\n* Oh, and final note. There's so much potential the other companies have with existing infrastructure and products. Does TSLA have a sprinter van that's used everywhere in the world? Oh...no? Do those Mercedes guys? Oh...yes? [Well how long for TSLA to enter that EV market? While they do that, these other companies are already established there and are already working on it.](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a34904439/mercedes-benz-sprinter-electric-coming-us/) I like Tesla, I've owned TSLA stock (sold awhile back) but its fucking bonkers to like them at this valuation.

{"title": "INTC: The best move for next week. An incredible, short term opportunity in a high expected value underdog play. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80", "selftext": "TLDR: INTC options are much cheaper and have a higher ROI than competitors options. Intel is experiencing a stronger price action of late relative to competitors and IV in INTC should be higher than is currently priced.\n\nLast week I exposed my view that Intel is an undervalued company and a very attractive short/medium/long term investment. In the interest of brevity I will not reiterate those points (go to my profile if you wish to read my thesis).\n\nToday I simply want to point out a somewhat hidden but obvious attribute of INTC's short term option play.  **\ud83d\ude80**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nINTC options 65$ strike expiring February 26th (1 week of gametime) are the move. The main reason for the 65$ strike is that the volume and open interest is high so transacting these contracts is easy and the  ask/bid gap is very small (in this case .37/.36) **\ud83d\ude80**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLast price for this option contract was at .36$ \\* (100) = 36$ per option contract\n\nAs of market close and after hours INTC shares are trading at 63.06$  or 3.08% way from being in the money. Given the current hype in the semiconductor industry (justified and for more than one reason), and given Intel's market performance of late in combination with the several catalysts, (which I outlined in my previous post) I find \"beating\" this option contract a more than 50% probability.\n\nTo illustrate the absolute value of INTC relative to its competitors I will take a target price of 67$ by Friday (2$ in the money) and my current position of 50 contracts.\n\nFor every dollar above 65$ my contracts are worth 5k$ so at 67$ they would be worth 10k$. Assuming Monday you are able to buy at its last sold price of 36$ per option contract it would cost you 36\\*50= 1800$. The ROI for this hypothetical play would be 555% (10,000/1,800) . To reach 67$ from the current price it would require a 6.24% increase in INTC stock price.\n\nReiterating, 3.08% up to be in the money and 6.24% up for ROI of 555%.\n\nNow I would like to show you the price/return potential for other companies in the space.\n\nFan favorite AMD closed trading at 89.48$ per share. Applying the same parameters to AMD a 3.08% increase in AMDs stock next week would bring it to 92.25$. Options for 92$ closed last price at 78$ per contract and options at 92.5 at 63$, average them both to get a fair value for what an option price at 92.25$ would be and it comes to 70$ per option contract. This makes AMD weekly options 94.4% more expensive than INTCs. To get 50 of these it would cost you 3500$ and to finalize the comparison an increase of 6.24% would bring AMD to 95$. Assuming you could get the hypothetical 92.25$ contracts you would have 13750$ and an ROI of 393%. **\ud83d\ude80**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSparing you from going through the same process with the other examples I will just summarize (feel free to check and correct my math).\n\nMicron: 3.08% upward move contracts < 90$ (they would be more expensive I am using 95 strike but its actually lower 94.4 to be precise) with an ROI at a 6.24% upwards move of 244%.\n\nTSM: 3.08% upward move contracts last price would be at around 83$ (volume and open interest is lower so last price is more divergent than ask/bid and would likely be higher than 83$) with an ROI at a 6.24% move of 518%. Also looks attractive but the ask/bid gap is quite high and low volume/open interest.\n\nI wont even do the example for NVDA because implied volatility is so high for these ranges the ROI example would be really low. Other semiconductor companies have the problem of having low volume as well, but I am sure there are others out there and you may even finda better deal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow before you call me stupid I understand the reason why the INTC contracts are much cheaper than these other. The IV (Implied volatility is lower).  The premiums are lower because the contract writers don't expect as big of swings in INTC as they do others. My thesis is though that the market makers for these contracts are incorrectly modeling the IV of INTC stock lower than it should be. Much the same way they were with Micron a couple weeks ago.  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis week INTC closed up 1.6%, Micron was up 1.95%, AMD down 4.8%, and TSM down 3.6%. This week as we know most of the markets had a small correction. As I had expected INTC outperformed its competition as well as the broad markets. The week before this one  INTC closed up 4% and YTD INTC is up 26.2%.\n\nGiven the combination of factors surrounding the semiconductor scene and Intel specifically, I find that the implied upward volatility on INTC should be higher, and that in not too long it will increase as it has done the past few weeks (although still very low). The main reason why INTC contracts are so cheap relative to competitors in the industry is a simple question of supply and demand. These more memetic and loved stocks options are more sought after by retail and on top of the \"real\" volatility premium another demand heavy premium accrues. Intel being hated in this sub for example has kept option premiums much lower than they would be if it was a fan favorite.\n\nSimilar things happen in sports betting. A favorite with a lot of demand will often move the lines beyond the house spread and sometimes produce an edge for an underdog. Intel is the underdog of this story, and an underdog with very high expected value. You might hate Intel but this could still be the play for you (so long as you believe the semiconductor scene is bound to profit these weeks).\n\nThe Milwaukee Bucks are not favorites to win the championship this year (odds at +750). They probably wont win the championship and I don't see much value in that bet at the moment, but if someone was selling me Bucks futures at +5000 Id snag them up. This is the analogy I will use for the current Intel option market.\n\nI am a degenerate. There is no shame in coming out as one in this sub, a family of autistic degenerates from all over the world. I like to gamble and so do you, but more than gamble I like to make money. I like to win and I do win.\n\nI have 50, 65$ INTC contracts expiring the coming Friday, 500 contracts at 80$ strike for April 16 , as well as 1700 shares long. I believe in this play in the short term and long term.\n\nFor the short term, a long shot bet, but not nearly as much as the option writers have them.\n\nThis is deep fucking value.  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**", "id": "lo1fvz", "created_utc": 1613803814.0, "score": 57, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 78, "comments": [{"body": "You need to learn how to format your shit but Godspeed retard.
