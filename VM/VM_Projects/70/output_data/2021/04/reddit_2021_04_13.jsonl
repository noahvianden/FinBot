{"title": "Reasons why my main products are futures options, the benefits...", "selftext": "There are several reasons why being comfortable trading futures and futures options are very beneficial to your overall trading success. I would like to outline a few of those benefits. \n\n**What is a futures contract?** \n\nIt is an agreement to sell or buy something in the future at a pre-determined price. The buyer and seller of the futures contract are locking in the purchase price in the future so no matter what the price may actually be in the future they have agreed today to do this transaction at a set price in the future. All futures contracts have expirations, like options but they trade very similar to equities that you are used to. \n\n**What are options on futures contracts?**\n\nThey behave very similarly to options on SPY, APPL, TSLA or any other common name. They have greeks, expirations, OI, etc... not going to go too much into this here. You know what options are. \n\n**So why trade these options on futures if they are the same as options on products I am more familiar with?** \n\n1) Span Margin - In summary it is a way to calculate risk on a trade and lets you use less buying power than you normally would in say a ETF or equity position. This lets you have a higher return on capital. \n\nSelling a .20 Delta  E-Mini S&P May 21 Exp. option only eats up $8,171 in buying power while giving me a credit of $1,450. \n\n[$1450 credit \\/ $8171 BPR = 17&#37; ROC if held to expiration. ](https://preview.redd.it/iqif2x85nys61.png?width=881&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f41cf840c748137514eeae279d22889e4ea6618)\n\nNow if I try to collect the same $1,450 using SPY options, using the same .2 Delta, same May 21 exp. that will cost over 30k in BPR. \n\n[$1,450 credit \\/ $30,280 BPR = 4.7&#37; ROC if held to expiration. ](https://preview.redd.it/3z6isyq3rys61.png?width=868&format=png&auto=webp&s=27ba577b2dcf47452dc83f80fee108faec39819b)\n\n2) Pure Market play - no company exposure. Playing futures and futures options limits the exposure to single company black swan events. The 'dick pick' dilemma is greatly reduced. I find this comforting that no one fraud case, management team or board can blow a trade for me. \n\n3) If there is a market wide black swan event I can be in or out before you can with an equity position. Futures and future options trade 23 hours a day 5.5 days a week. The times they open and close are a bit wonky so I will link to them [here](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading-hours.html), but having access to my positions more often is always a plus. \n\n4) Not a CPA or tax professional and don't play one on TV but in the USA futures and options on futures fall under IRS Code Section 1256 which basically splits the profit 60/40. So 60 of the profit is taxes at long term capital gains and 40% is taxed at short term capital gains. Even if you hold it for 2 days it is still 60/40 split long term to short term cap gains. So my /ES future vs SPY trade I get to keep more of the profit I made while using less buying power for the same delta, same expiration trade. \n\nThere are other minor benefits such has IRA friendly, less assignment risk, etc.. but those are the main benefits. \n\n**Aren't like futures on corn, wheat, and soy beans - this guy thinking I'm farmer John out here...**\n\nYou are correct there is dozens and dozens of futures market and to be honest I know very little about of a lot of them and 95% are not really tradable because 1) they don't have options 2) low volume and open interest 3) the products are just to big in nature for retail traders to trade. There are futures on currencies, bonds, indexes, agriculture products, metals, energy and more...\n\nI stick to what I know, these are tight bid/ask, good volume and have related ETFs products that you are familiar with. \n\n/ES which is the S&P, moves just like SPY\n\n/NQ which is the Nasdaq, moves just like QQQ\n\n/GC which is Gold moves just like GLD\n\n/SL which is Silver, moves just like SLV\n\n/RTY which is Russell 2000, moves just like IWM\n\n**Some drawbacks to futures and options futures trading:**\n\nLeverage - One /es contract controls about $200,000 worth of notional value.  Just because you are using less buying power doesn't mean there is less risk. \n\nThe expiration cycle - some options on futures are cash settled meaning you just square up and close out the trade with the counter party. Some options have assignment where if it is ITM you are now the proud owner of a futures contract. And if the option and the future expire in the same month that is a different expiration. \n\nDelivery Risk - This is the old story of 1000 barrels of oil showing up at your door. Very unlikely to open has your broker will probably close the trade on your behalf before this happens but a risk none-the-less. \n\nObviously do your own DD, do not go out and trade a futures options based on a random guy's internet post but wanted to get the community thinking about how to better leverage your time and money.", "id": "mq5zfm", "created_utc": 1618331713.0, "score": 71, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 80, "comments": [{"body": "Corn, Soybeans, Wheat, Natural Gas, Aussie Dollar, Canadian Dollar, Euro and interest rates are all plenty liquid futures with options to trade.

{"title": "GME Current Technical Analysis Standpoint", "selftext": "# Disclaimer\n\n***I do not provide personal investment advice and I am not a qualified licensed investment advisor. And as always, conduct your own due diligence before making any investment decisions.***\n\n# CONTENT\n\n1. **Introduction**\n2. **RSI**\n3. **MACD**\n4. **OBV**\n\n# 1. INTRODUCTION\n\nMy fellow apes,\n\nFirst off,  I will be using indicators to help gauge future outlooks. But it is important to remember that although indicators can help show what a situation is like. It is just that, there is no certainty behind any of what will be mentioned here today. Anyways, I will be using 3 indicators (RSI, MACD, OBV) to help form a thesis from a technical standpoint.\n\n# 2. RSI\n\n>*The relative strength index (RSI) is a momentum indicator used in technical analysis that measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions*\n\n**DAILY CHART:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5zx3i10y70t61.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=df7497de1f97fbb566878c7773d6754bd3e9bd0b\n\nTypically when the RSI falls short of 30, the underlying security can be considered underbought. Although GME currently has an RSI of 42 on the daily chart, it is important to denote that since the start of January GME's RSI has not dipped below 41. Also, remember that this timeframe accounts for the malicious practices played by MM's and Hedge Funds during the great drop from  $500 - $40. Based on this, 42 can be seen as the new 30, valuing GME as underbought/oversold.\n\n**4 HOUR CHART:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rb879baz70t61.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=d863c3ff44db6080f2ad4bc76b8b53b1b703423f\n\nMoving on to the 4-hour chart, GME's current RSI is 30. Similar to the daily chart the current RSI sets a new low since the previous levels that have been tested across the $10 range. Now, based on past trends the last time GME tested this level an immediate bounce followed. For instance, on March 24 GME had an RSI of 31 which was immediately followed by an increase of around 80% in just a few days. Although past performance is not indicative of future results, GME is situated in a similar position and the RSI has already begun its reversal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**SYNOPSIS:**\n\nRSI has blown past the underbought/oversold territory, and this is shown through a plateau on the daily chart and a slight reversal on the 4-hour chart.\n\n# 3. MACD\n\n>*Moving average convergence divergence (MACD) is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a security's price. The MACD is calculated by subtracting the 26-period exponential moving average (EMA) from the 12-period EMA. The result of that calculation is the MACD line.*\n\n**DAILY CHART:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yqrqk60280t61.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=adc0d0ea92a77a204ab789bc2551df670de68189\n\nMost recently GME's MACD diverged on the 19th of March. Leaving us in a downwards trend. To help predict when this trend might end I will be taking the previous dip from $500 down to $40 to account. On the 3rd of February, a divergence occurred placing GME in a downwards trend. And it wasn't until the 25th of February until another divergence occurred, setting GME's trajectory upwards of $350 in the matter of a few days. Although we have quite a ways to hit the original MACD reversal levels found on February 25th, it is important to recall the blatant manipulation which caused retail to originally sell. Leading me to believe that retail is now better equipped to handle such events. Which should speed up the process of another divergence occurring, further placing us in an upwards trend.\n\n**4 HOUR CHART:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5qz3dz5380t61.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc2f428e18a6d6a18e8b952991300b8c21705ffe\n\nWhen taking a look at the 4-hour chart we can already see plateauing on the MACD histogram. Although this timeframe is not large enough to accurately predict whether another divergence will occur soon. It does however indicate that there is not enough selling pressure to cause a major price drop anytime soon.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**SYNOPSIS:**\n\nMACD shows that we are nearing the end of the current downwtrend and I am hopeful that a reversal will take place in the near future.\n\n# 4. OBV\n\n>*On-balance volume (OBV) is a technical trading momentum indicator that uses volume flow to predict changes in stock price.*\n\nI will be comparing the OBV of different stocks to highlight what is currently going on with GME.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[TSLA - Looks Normal](https://preview.redd.it/634gvzc880t61.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a3a698ccf7e7e807cba7ff80b4e95e7aeceab8d)\n\n[AMD - Looks Normal](https://preview.redd.it/jkos50ca80t61.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ca8433b8804dc564c5e5a99bab2e590f1ee6e6a)\n\n[PLTR - Looks Normal](https://preview.redd.it/xa3dmtjb80t61.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=60e001d2be803bda3ed830f7ad100f284f2a4a14)\n\n[GME - Wait what's going on here?](https://preview.redd.it/qj4g7ntd80t61.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b68a6ea955d74ad5d8204293edc6b3c83261fb2)\n\nI want to keep this short, but if you want to read more [u/jarofmy](https://www.reddit.com/user/jarofmy/) has a more detailed post on this matter.\n\nAs we can tell, the OBV figure will typically maintain the same look as the price chart. But this is not the case with GME. Towards the end of January, when the price of GME was fluctuating anywhere from $300 - $500, OBV maintained volume of around 20 million on the 2-hour chart. Current OBV is hovering at around 21 million, a slight increase from previous levels. Indicating that GME's price should be at a similar price point to when OBV was at 20 million. However, GME's price is non-reflective of this and continues to descend. If you were to solely gauge the OBV and predict a price, $300 - $500 is where GME should currently stand.\n\n# TL:DR\n\nTechnical Analysis on GME is currently very bullish. And I believe that we are nearing a reversal in due time. RSI and MACD are indicative of this and OBV helps to further illustrate this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**PLEASE REMEMBER THAT TECHNICAL ANALYSIS IS CONSIDERED PURE SPECULATION - AND REMEMBER TO DO YOUR OWN DD.**", "id": "mqbftn", "created_utc": 1618347529.0, "score": 782, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 74, "comments": [{"body": "You had me at DISCLAIMER", "score": 240, "replies": [{"body": "Good for you for making it so far.
