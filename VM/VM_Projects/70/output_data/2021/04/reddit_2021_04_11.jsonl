{"title": "The Economy is not the Market, or why the S&P 500 could easily NOT hit 10,000 before the end of the decade", "selftext": "Recently there have been a lot of arguments to the effect that \"US companies will keep doing great the next decade and so stocks will do great as well.\" Over the long-run (several decades), this is certainly true: stocks represent ownership in a company, and as the earnings of the company increase so will its stock price. However, in the short-run (a decade or less) the performance of a stock is also driven by *investor valuation and confidence*, measured by the price-to-earnings ratio. It is perfectly possible for a company to increase its earnings, but for its stock to move sideways or even drop if investor enthusiasm for the stock falls.\n\nFor example, from 2000 to 2010 the [US real GDP](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDPC1) grew from $12.9 trillion to $15.4 trillion, even after taking the hit from the recession in 2008. However, over that same time period the S&P 500 index [dropped](https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-historical-prices/table/by-year) 300 points from 1,425 to 1,123. What on earth happened? The problem was investor confidence and P/E was at an all time high in 2000 at the top of the dot-com bubble, which then plummeted after the bubble burst, and then plummeted again during the global financial crisis. Even though the US economy did well that decade, the S&P 500 did not.\n\nOf course, I cannot predict the future, but investors should be prepared if history repeats itself the next decade. The current S&P 500 [Cyclically Adjusted P/E ratio](https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe) (CAPE) is at an almost record high of 37. Assuming a historically consistent growth rate of 10% over the next decade, the S&P 500 will more than double in value. However, if over that decade the CAPE falls to a more realistic historical average of 16, then *all those gains will be wiped out*. It is very possible for the US economy to do great the next decade, but for the S&P 500 to move sideways.\n\nIn light of this possibility, what is an investor to do? Oddly enough, my advice is the same as the exuberant post that prompted this reply, but for a different reason. Existing investors at the start of 2000 went nowhere over the next decade, but they performed marvelously the decade after when the S&P more than tripled to its current valuation of over 4000. In fact, 2000 to 2010 was a great decade to invest in the stock market, since you spent 10 long years buying great US companies at a bargain price. If the stock market drops again in the future, you should ride it out and keep investing into index funds or solid companies that will weather the storm and recover once investor confidence increases again.", "id": "moksb8", "created_utc": 1618117485.0, "score": 159, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 68, "comments": [{"body": "So either the S&P will hit 10,000 this decade.\n\nOr it won't hit 10,000 decade.\n\nGot it. \ud83d\ude0e", "score": 235, "replies": [{"body": "Just buy puts and calls.

Not scientific research and not hard data, but my feel on things:\n\n1. Easy stimulus money.  People not spending as much as they do normally when they could go out pre-corona.\n2. The rise of retail investing and commission free trading via Robinhood, etc.\n3. The GME and meme stock saga.  People who had never invested before started investing after getting into the market originally via meme stocks.\n4. Huge profits being made in last year's (and this year's) bull run.  FOMO.\n5. People don't want to hold cash because of inflation fears and trash returns on savings accounts compared to equities or other assets.\n\nAll of this means that young people who are sitting on a lot of cash are suddenly dumping a lot of money into the market all at once.  Again, this is not about dollar cost averaging your paycheck over the period of years.  This is about dumping a large percentage of your savings into the market all at more or less the same time.  This is my case, and I don't have the data, but my impression on the ground is that I'm not the only one.  A lot of retailers are getting into the market right now, and they're not getting in small.  Please feel free to corroborate or debunk my observation.\n\nLet's take a hypothetical example of what I mean.  Say a young investor is sitting on savings of about $15,000 that he or she traditionally held in a savings account.  This young investor decides to get into the market in early February after getting their feet wet with GME.\n\nNow, most people would say \"index funds, index funds!\"  This is what I came across.  Luckily, I did some thinking for myself.\n\nImagine if this person dumps $10,000 of their savings (2/3 of their $15,000 total) into SPY.  Could it be a good play?  Yes, it could be.  Historically, would it *always* have been a good play?  No, no it wouldn't have been.  It would not have been a good play in 2000 during the dot com bubble.  It would not have been a good play in 2007.  It would have been a horrible play in a scenario like 1989 Japan.\n\nI know at this point people are going to say \"stop trying to time the market\".  I think this is where people lose me.  I don't recommend timing the market, *per se.*  What I'm recommending is **being fully aware of the risks of betting large sums of your personal savings on the whole market, at one particular point in time.**\n\nThis market is weird.  Everybody knows this.  I don't know if I'm bullish or bearish, but I'm definitely cautious.\n\nIf you want to dollar cost average your savings into SPY over months and years, I think that's an absolutely wonderful strategy.  I just think noobies should be aware that, hey, maybe dumping 2/3 (or more) of your savings into an index fund all at the same time may not be the smartest play in the world.\n\nWhat happened was, as a noob, I was reading the same old tired advice: \"index funds, index funds, index funds!\"  And I just think there's a very big caveat to that when we're talking about new investors who are not averaging their investment over time, but rather betting large amounts of their savings all at once.\n\nHope I could explain my concern.", "id": "mooup7", "created_utc": 1618138034.0, "score": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.53, "num_comments": 75, "comments": [{"body": "Your whole thesis is that lump sum investing can be risky vs dollar cost averaging.

I personally have less bond exposure, but Bogle himself suggests:\n\n> roughly your age in bonds; for instance, if you are 45, 45% of your portfolio should be in high-quality bonds... but clearly ... must be adjusted to reflect an investor's objectives, risk tolerance, and overall financial position\n\n-\n\n> I understand that I will miss out on some upside, but that's fine. I just don't want to lose much of what I have.\n\nYes your portfolio is yours, and your risk tolerance is yours as well. As often mentioned in stock advice, do whatever helps you sleep at night. But the numbers and logic do, imo, point to a risk tolerance closer to what Bogle and other experts suggest so I do think most people should listen to that advice.\n\n> The broader point which I'm trying to make is that there are alternatives to index funds. It's not always THE way. It depends on your needs.\n\nI think I kinda get your point, but also kinda don't. Yes if you are trying to keep your money from devaluing maybe there are some defensive stocks and bonds to buy to help you sleep at night. But cash is kinda the default and I don't think it's terrible if you're too conservative to put it in the market. And if you are investing or trying to grow wealth, I cannot think of a safer, lower effort way atm that has higher returns than index funds.\n\nI guess overall if I had to summarize it seems like you just have a lower risk tolerance for investing, regardless of incoming bear markets. That's totally cool and there are tons of strategies (DCA, defensive stocks, bonds, cash etc) to mitigate that. But there is a recommended risk tolerance for whatever age you are, and imo the consensus really is that lump-summing into index funds honestly are the best way to be exposed to higher risk.

Perhaps I would be wise to listen to Mr. Bogle and other people more.  I do take their expertise into account.  But I'm still learning what's the line between just doing what others have tested, and testing things out for myself and learning the old-fashioned way: trial and error.\n\nFWIW, I'm quite happy with what I'm doing.
