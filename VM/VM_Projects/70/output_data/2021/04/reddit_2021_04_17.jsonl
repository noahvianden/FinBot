They will all gain access to NFL's data feed and be able to integrate their sports betting content into NFL's media platforms (website, app, etc.). DKNG also extended their rights as the exclusive daily fantasy partner for the NFL. The NFL does NOT have a direct partnership with a sportsbook at this point, just something to note.\n\nTo answer your question, I do think that this is a big deal. Even if other options end up coming onboard in later years, there is something to be said for first mover advantage. I think DraftKing's main strategy is marketing and building name/brand recognition and loyalty, as evidenced by their half billion spent over the past year on this. Along those lines, when people watch the NFL this season they will see DKNG promoted over and over after already seeing it plastered across several other sports areas.

So much that there wasn't one, not on OTC, that was under $1 end of year.  So yeah there was a ton of hype obviously.  I try to buy biotech that has a lot of cash relative to their market cap.   I just want to avoid the dilution events and that makes the probability of dilution lower.  Biotechs burn so much cash and they make zilch  They make money by hyping their studies and getting retail to pay for the offerings they need.   My favorite biotech atm because of its cash position being LESS than its market cap(how many do you know that have that?)  is $ABIO.   The problem with ABIO is they don't pump lol so it's a really quiet one.  But I do well selling Puts and Calls due to illiquidity.  My philosophy in general is that it has a strong margin of safety.  It shouldn't go down much at least.  They shouldn't be diluting any time soon etc..  Meanwhile we wait for their treatment results.  In ABIO's case it is a P2 covid treatment due this summer.\n\nThat's my biotech strategy in a nutshell. I really don't care what the treatment, cure, study is.  I'm sure it's awesome.  It's more about what their balance sheet looks like, when they might dilute, how much retail support do they have etc....   \n\nOn the short side of that.  If they had a huge run up and they burn cash heavily you can expect dilution.  At that point I'm more likely to take a net short position.  Usually selling naked calls, sometimes going from covers to naked etc...\n\nSo that was a tangent but illustrative.  To your question directly?  Biotech definitely got hammered last couple months for good reason.  All of retail got hammered so yeah biotech is the riskiest subgroup of that subgroup.  So of course it gets sold off worse.  Was it overhyped?  Absolutely.  That's its job.  Literally.  Was it overvalued?  Of course.  Is that bad?  Nope, that's biotech.  That's how they raise funds.  I don't know the future of the prices.

It's just easier to make money selling calls after the dilution.  The concept is there will be a wall around the offering price so sell calls above that price.  Any pumps that go over you can continue to sell calls at higher strikes because you assume the pump will be smashed by the financier who is trying to sell their giant bags.  The financier also likes to sell covered calls on those bags so they have an interest in seeing that the price doesn't remain up there in the short term.  So no, not prediction.  Do it after dilution. Big premiums as retail buyers are pissed and think the price should be higher. No surprises tht way.\n\nLook at RUBY and HGEN after the offerings.  You'll see what I mean.

It achieved it's previous spac value and I sold.  Also though, it's a biotech and we're still waiting for the 10K.  They filed a 10kNT that said 10K in 15 days and still no 10K.   So there are still issues with the finances.  Worse I think that after the 10K comes out they will dilute.  So really I'm just waiting for all that to pan out.  If they dilute it will likely become one of my short plays by selling naked calls.\n\nMVIS:  So pumped right now.  Why?  MSFT contract on Hololens 2.  Why even more pumpy?  Possible use in the $22B MSFT Military contract(complete speculation btw).  I'm skeptical because I've see companies like MSFT and AAPL find cheaper solutions to things they have used in their prototypes in the past but now want to mass produce.
