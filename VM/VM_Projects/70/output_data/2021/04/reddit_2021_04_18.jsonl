{"title": "The Zone of Greed - One of the Most Common Mistakes", "selftext": "**Not Waiting For Confirmation**   \n\n\nI get it.  You want to be *ahead of the move.*  If you wait you will have already missed your chance.  \n\nThis isn't logic - it is greed (and yes Gordon Gekko, Greed is Good, we all know. We've all seen it).\n\nIn this case it is a very well-defined **Zone of Greed**.\u00a0 This is the specific part of a move that you\u2019re afraid of missing out on if you wait.\n\nThe most common way this happens is with **The Gut Call** \\- otherwise known as *picking tops and bottoms*.\u00a0\u00a0It can\u2019t go up/down forever right?\u00a0 So instead of identifying where key technical levels of support/resistance are and then waiting for those to be violated, you jump early.\u00a0 Who wants to wait until SPY breaks 414.75 before they short it?? That\u2019s 2 1/2 points you\u2019re giving up!\u00a0 (if you are Day Trading a simple trendline would suffice).  \n\nAbout half of the trades I hear people suggest are based on nothing more than a \"due for a reversal\" mentality.  Remember:\n\n**Successful traders don\u2019t predict the market, they act when the market confirms a direction.**\u00a0 \n\nNotice I said \"Traders\", not \"Investors\".  Investors try to predict long-term, but short-term retail traders are jumping on a bandwagon and going for the ride.  \n\nThe moment you realize that, is the moment you start becoming consistent in your trading.  With some notable exceptions (GME), retail traders **do not** move the market, institutions do, and when they do they leave bread crumbs for us to follow.  We can see the results of those plays in the price action and if we are patient enough, when those results are confirmed, we can cash in on them. \n\nHumbling, I know.  \n\nConsider this - you are an hour into trading and see that TSLA is down $6 on the day.  In your experience when TSLA starts the day down, it tends to finish even farther down.  So you short it.  You didn't look to see if TSLA violated any support levels or what the volume is for that day, you just don't want to miss any more of the downward move.  However, perhaps SPY is down $3 on the day so far, a fairly significantly drop and compared to SPY TSLA is actually doing quite well.  TSLA has Relative Strength against the market.  With the market down $3 TSLA should be down much more than just $6.  Thus, the moment SPY rebounds, TSLA takes off and winds up finishing up $9 while your Puts get destroyed.  \n\nIf you just asked yourself one question - \"Do I have technical confirmation?\" before making a trade, and moved ahead ***only*** if the answer is \"Yes\" - your trading results would improve dramatically.  Does this mean you give up a certain portion of a move up or down? Yes.  But you also give up being wrong so often that it isn't nearly made up for by the times you are right.\n\nThat small range that you are giving up is not worth the chance you are taking.  For SPY right now that would be a zone of roughly $2.50.  Between the current price (417.20) and the support level (414.75).  That is the additional profit you would generate if you shorted SPY before a technical breakdown.\n\nIt is for this same reason you shouldn't hold a position over earnings.  Once again you are afraid of missing a huge move in the stock.  But as we have all seen, earnings is a crap shoot - a stock could crush earnings and drop 10% the next day.  Wait until you see the response and then play the response.  Even worse are people who buy calls or puts right before earnings and then watch as their options get crushed by a deflating IV.\n\nYour goal should be consistent wins every day.  You can only reach that goal when you stop chasing huge moves.

Not just \u201cif I draw lines on this chart it looks like 414.75,\u201d what factors (moving average, relative strength, news/market events, historic pricing) actually determine this value, and how can you *reliably* calculate a) this value, and b) what to do when the stock price hits it?\n\nSpecifically, how useful is this value?

Aka \u201cas the stock moves around this price, it will either go up or down, or stay the same, but I think it\u2019s going to go down\u201d.

For example if they bought on the way down and are bag-holding, they might want to sell when it hits that price again. Or if they wanted to buy and missed a dip, they might set a limit order to buy next time.\n\nThen if there's continuous buy pressure on a price for example, it might run into a whole batch of these limit sell orders and fail to move the price further. If the momentum is good enough to fill all those orders then it might get past them and suddenly speed up, hence a break out. On top of that, because people are aware of this, others will try to exploit it by setting their own order around the same levels.
