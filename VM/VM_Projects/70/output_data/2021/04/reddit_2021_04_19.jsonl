Plotting options data gives so much insight into why they are priced the way they are. If you're new to options these plots should make it really obvious why weeklies are like lotto tickets, and leaps are much more like owning the stock long term (with leverage).\n\nI find it more helpful than a lot of broker tools, and plotting the actual data gives a quick visual representation of theta. \n\n# QQQ\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o45w2rc1w1u61.png?width=2357&format=png&auto=webp&s=81ac3d03c3d17e7fb5194dba3657ff143ade3511\n\n# SPY\n\n[Legend is really cluttered.

The market-makers will price options based on based on well-understood underlying assumptions. \n\nCurves of VXX with strike are inversed relative to SPY and QQQ, which I find interesting. This would probably mean the longer time goes on, the higher the expectation volatility comes back up. The higher relative cost of for OTM strikes would indicate that when VIX does eventually spike again, people are betting it will spike quite high, and you pay a premium this insurance. \n\nWith skyrocketing IV, sometimes things get out-of-wack.

During periods of elevated volatility like most of last year, expectations of future vol was downwards, so the futures were in backwardation ie. the expectation for the entire of last year was that future volatility would be lower.

A phase contracts when the next 30-day ADV falls -45% compared to the previous 30-day ADV\n   * these numbers are arbitrary and were chosen as they seem to model the volume-phases reasonably well without picking up the noise\n* **Limitations**:\n   * Coinbase Pro as a proxy for Coinbase, the main app's trading volume could also be substantial\n   * Trading pairs are a curated list and do not capture volume in totality\n   * Coinbase's fee changes remain unchanged [Source](https://twitter.com/SquawkCNBC/status/1382279472599162880)\n\n# USD Daily Trading Volume by Exchange\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ukpzq5lgr5u61.png?width=1604&format=png&auto=webp&s=2c48bca3fbf1a4b37f57a06464490b571b7866d6\n\n* Binance is the most-active exchange\n* Coinbase is the most-active exchange *thats available in the US*\n\n# 'Global' USD Daily Trading Volume + Phases\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nm7p04lor5u61.png?width=1604&format=png&auto=webp&s=28b1136683aa37e592f7641b378af8cc4dbb89f1\n\n* 'Global' as in across all exchanges and all pairs, mentioned above\n* The current Jan 2021 breakout observes an explosive volume phase, and is the source behind Coinbase's eye-popping Q1 $1.8B revenue and $800M profit\n* July 2019 will provide some guidance on the January 2021 phase. At the time, a record-high volume phase is followed by a contraction that is sustained and higher than the prior long-term volume phase (\\~Janurary 2019).\n* It would be misleading to not comment on January 2018's phase contraction. The favorable explanation is July 2018 volume phase is \\~4 times larger than Apr 2017 phase. More so, the January 2018 cycle had 'altcoins' flaring to record high valuations, and are not entirely captured in the trading pairs provided. Additionally, the 2018 cycle likely did not have substantial institutional support that we are witnessing today\n\n# Coinbase Pro vs. Gemini\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1d1gvbmqr5u61.png?width=1604&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3eb44ff085323d26a7b460a7955387b5718f47c\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g41u0mkrr5u61.png?width=1604&format=png&auto=webp&s=f3993821ccb72aaa7f319a3dcde57f9d939fb901\n\n* This was a byproduct discovery, but Gemini's most recent trade volume seems to match the 2018 cycle. This to me implies that Gemini's user base has not grown aggressively as Coinbase's or its that institutional investors/traders have really warmed up to Coinbase. Bullish.\n\n# Volume Phase Breakout + Contraction\n\nHow much does average daily  volume change between phases?\n\n|Exchange|Average Phase Change|Average Phase Breakout|Average Phase Contraction|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Global|68.17%|157.4%|\\-29.17%|\n|Coinbase|54.16%|121.81%|\\-36.04%|\n|Binance|81.53%|152.4%|\\-12.95%|\n|Kraken|54.53%|129.3%|\\-35.19%|\n|Binance US|104.01%|148.87%|\\-52.97%|\n|Gemini|67.96%|178.26%|\\-32.31%|\n\n* Average Phase Change: the average % change between phases (regardless of up or down)\n* Average Phase Breakout: the average % change when a new phase is *higher* than the previous\n* Average Phase Contraction: the average % change when a new phase is *lower* than the previous\n\n# Seasonality\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0jpardbtr5u61.png?width=1589&format=png&auto=webp&s=51d24e7bfcde67827420ac4f666f162e64eafc6e\n\n* To confirm that Q1 (and Q2 estimates) can be used for Q3 and Q4, I perform a simple seasonality check. For each month since 2017: what is the average daily volume\n* The Colab notebook contains the sum of USD trading volume by month\n* There's no immediate explanation for why different parts of the year would have increased trading activity, therefore I assume that trading volume does not exhibit seasonality.\n\n# Forecasts and Price Targets\n\n* Assumes that operational costs are $1 billion (Q1 2021 $1.8 Billion, 800 Million Profit)\n* Volume contraction in Q2 is carried out for the remainder of the year (except for Neutral-Bear case)\n\n**Using Coinbase Historical Volume Contraction**\n\n|Case|Volume Contraction|2021 Profit Forecast|Share Price, if 50x PE|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Bull|0%|$3.2 billion|$800.00|\n|Neutral|\\-18.02%|$2.23 billion|$556.74|\n|Bear|\\-36.04%|$1.25 billion|$313.49|\n\n**Using Global Historical Volume Contraction**\n\n|Case|Volume Contraction|2021 Profit Forecast|Share Price, if 50x PE|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Bull|0%|$3.2 billion|$800.00|\n|Neutral|\\-14.585%|$2.4 billion|$603.11|\n|**Neutral-Bear**|**-14.585% each Quarter**|**$1.77  billion**|**$443.09**|\n|Bear|\\-29.17%|$1.62 billion|$406.23|\n\n* Bull Case: the volume does not contract at all for the remainder of 2021\n* Neutral Case: the volume contracts half as strong as typical contractions, and holds for the remainder of 2021\n* **Neutral-Bear Case: the volume contracts -14.5% quarter over quarter (Q2's volume is -14.5% over Q1, and Q3's volume is -14.5% over Q2, etc.)**\n* Bear Case: the volume contracts as much as typical contractions\n\n*Rough* formula:\n\n`share price = ((1.8 + (1.8 * Q2-contraction) + (1.8 * Q3-contraction) + (1.8 * Q4-contraction) - 4) / 0.2 * 50)`\n\n* `1.8` $1.8 Billion revenue Q1\n* `contraction` 0.8 = -20% volume contraction\n* `4` subtract operational costs. Q1: $800 million profit off of $1.8 billion revenue, therefore \\~$1 billion operational costs each quarter\n* `0.2` 200 million outstanding shares\n* `50` 50x PE ratio target\n\n# Closing Thoughts (Apr 2021)\n\nThe USD volume is exceptionally noisy and fluctuates aggressively. Tweaking the parameters can and will show an entirely different forecast. No one will know how, when, and where this volume-phase will end up; therefore approximating Coinbase's revenue via exchange volume has substantial risk.\n\nBut with increased institutional adoption, balance sheet reporting, and favorable discourse around cryptocurrencies, my own impressions believe that we haven't seen the volume-phase 'top' and I believe the subsequent contraction won't be extreme as previously observed. When comparing Coinbase against its competitors, its doing well to continue its growth. Additionally, this analysis entirely ignores other coins, trading pairs, and the additional revenue streams expected by Coinbase. Despite the possibility of a strong volume-phase contraction, I believe this analysis provides a somewhat incomplete picture and does not factor in other bullish cases for Coinbase.\n\nIn the words of Thanos, if we take each case as equally-probable, \"perfectly-balanced, as all things should be\", the expected value per share (average of each case) is between $556.74 - $603.11 (neutral case). I believe taking on risk head-first is a \"small price to pay for salvation\"\n\n# Positions\n\n* 6x shares @ $383\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j7uyroi7s5u61.png?width=1580&format=png&auto=webp&s=9461f60c33461fb0d928f79e7c0fef79bf8e9c80", "id": "mua3vo", "created_utc": 1618865121.0, "score": 116, "upvote_ratio": 0.68, "num_comments": 67, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 54, "replies": [{"body": "a mix of buying power reasons and i like doing this detailed DD for recreation", "score": 64, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 26, "replies": [{"body": "hopefully if my buying power frees up, i'll go in heavier before end of Q2 and provide an update", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "If crypto tanks, does COIN tank too?", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "in my opinion no.
