{"title": "When I hear about Coinbase being a bad investment a couple of other tech giants that were \"destined to fail\" come to mind.", "selftext": "Let me get this out of the way. I own 1 (like uno) share of COIN at $320. I'm prepared to buy 1 share for every $20 it falls below that if it does continue to drop. I want to reflect on two tech companies that were supposed to be \"dead in the water\" dozens of earning calls ago. Netflix and Facebook. \n\nI remember following Facebooks IPO in particular and the internet as a whole (as well as myself) said it's ABSOLUTELY DEAD MONEY. There was no way it was ever going to continue to make money. Everyone around me was \"leaving it.\" The valuation was \"insane.\" The stock price tanked pretty good out of the gates and everyone laughed. It stayed low for weeks (maybe months if I remember right) and I patted myself on the back for staying away. As earnings gained more and more traction the perception started to change. What was pointed out was that the parents of Facebook users were becoming more active then any of the core group that gave facebook it's start. These same people really enjoyed playing the browser games that most \"kids\" lost interest in. Businesses started using it to reach clients. Facebook itself didn't change but the user base did. As time goes on it continues to make good money and the stock has proven to be a good money maker. It defied the popular opinion. \n\nWhen we think about too much competition in the future Netflix comes to mind. Netflix was also supposed to have been \"cooked\" ages ago because of the competition that was coming about. When Prime Video launched it was the \"end of Netflix's growth.\" When the users in America were maxed out there was \"no room for growth.\" Netflix grew globally and offered exclusive content. There ended up being plenty of room for many streaming companies and everyone has been making money (this could be debated today but I'm comparing to ten years ago here). \n\nI assume you get my comparisons to Coinbase. The arguments against Coinbase are that the valuation is too high and there is no room for growth. The platform sucks and everyone on reddit is \"leaving it.\" There are tons of companies that will steal business from Coinbase to make them unprofitable. \n\nI would argue we've seen this before. If Crypto has the future so many of you think it does then there should be plenty of business opportunities for everyone. The grandmas and grandpas that aren't in Crypto yet will go to the most legitimate company in the space (COIN). If my kids grandparents can call any video streaming platform \"Netflix\" I assume the same is possible for all crypto exchanges being called \"a Coinbase.\" Being first and top of mind goes a long way. The potential customer base out there is huge for COIN and for others. \n\nSide note: ETFs will be picking up COIN for their portfolios as they are required. A lot of institutions will be holding COIN soon if they aren't already. \n\nSorry this post got a bit sloppy. I started out with a lot of good points in my head but they didn't type out that way. I'm on my phone in a waiting room killing time. There are good arguments against my arguments but I don't think we are seeing enough of the supporting ones for Coinbase.\n\nTL;DR Facebook was a \"for sure\" flop when it went public for similar reasons as COIN. Netflix also was supposed to fail a number of times due to capped growth. Lastly, in my opinion anyone who owns TSLA doesn't have a right to talk about stocks being overvalued.", "id": "mr3ex1", "created_utc": 1618445219.0, "score": 35, "upvote_ratio": 0.68, "num_comments": 74, "comments": [{"body": "The error in your logic is, coin hasn\u2019t cornered the market.
