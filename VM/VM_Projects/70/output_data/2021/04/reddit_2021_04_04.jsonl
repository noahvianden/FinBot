{"title": "Buying more ASO Calls", "selftext": " \n&nbsp;\n\n**TL;DR**: ASO looks a lot like RKT did in February when there was a massive spike. Short interest is high (may be over 45%) on a stock that has been steadily rising since its IPO in late 2020. They beat earnings expectations in a similar fashion to RKT (1.09 actual vs. 0.62 expected EPS = 76% beat). Undervalued stock that is primed for a squeeze means bears r fuk. \n \n&nbsp;\n  \nOk, for those of you apes with a few wrinkles, I will explain why you might be able to take your wife and her boyfriend and her parents to Red Lobster and order more than water and biscuits. \n \n&nbsp;\n \n**2021 is the year of the squeezes and the SI% on this bad boy is HIGH**\n \n&nbsp;\n \nHedgies have shorted a wide swath of the market, with a focus on retailers. Makes sense, right? The pandemic has hit a lot of retailers hard, forcing a lot of store closures. Academy Sports & Outdoors has been able to thrive through the pandemic for a few reasons: \n \n1. Their stores are mainly located in southern states whose COVID restrictions are far more lax than their northern counterparts. \n  \n2. Guns and ammo. There has been a massive pullback on offering guns and ammo by big box retailers due to a shift in public sentiment due to mass shootings. However, thanks to the pandemic and civil unrest, more people are buying guns than ever. ASO has not curtailed their gun and ammo offerings, which are a recession-proof sales channel right next to liquor.  \n \n&nbsp;\n\n \nRetailers have been shorted massively (see GME) with the shorts expecting that retail will die with the rise of online sales. Maybe they are right in the long term, but for now, people are still going to stores. Here in GA, you wouldn't know there is a pandemic if people weren't wearing masks. The mall parking lots are full. The short interest on ASO was 45.21% on 3/15 according to TD Ameritrade (compare that to 36.6% on RKT in late February). The stock is up 147% since its IPO in October 2020 without any significant dips, which tells us one thing: none of the shorts are in the money.  I first took interest in ASO about a month ago when I saw them at the top of the shorted list. Investing in stocks in January that had high short interest was quite lucrative for me, so I've been trying to continue investing in shorted stocks that appear to have a bright future. Because bears r fuk and squeezes are fun. \n   \n&nbsp;\n\nLet's look at the short interest over time for ASO: \n \n&nbsp;\n\n|Report Date|Total Shares Sold Short|Dollar Volume Sold Short|Change from Previous Report|Percentage of Float Shorted|Days to Cover|Price on Report Date|\n:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|\n|3/15/2021|12,510,000 shares|$308.37 million|+0.8%|39.4%|9.1|$24.65|\n|2/26/2021|12,410,000 shares|$305.04 million|-3.0%|39.1%|8.3|$24.58|\n|2/12/2021|12,790,000 shares|$306.45 million|+24.5%|41.2%|8.9|$23.96|\n|1/29/2021|10,270,000 shares|$262.50 million|+10.1%|33.1%|7.3|$25.56|\n|1/15/2021|9,330,000 shares|$196.58 million|No Change|44.8%|8.4|$21.07|\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWe can see that short interest has increased over time up to a high here of 39.4% on 3/15. TD Ameritrade says 45.21% and we know that short interest is not clear cut, so there is some variance on that  SI%. \n \n&nbsp;\n\nMost shares were shorted between $21 - $25 and were still shorted on 3/15. What has happened to the price since 3/15? It was driven down to a low of $23.19. As seen on [this chart](https://i.imgur.com/yrwzR6R.jpg). This means that most of the shorts did not become profitable during the biggest drop since the latest SI% report and likely did not cover. There was another seemingly artificial drop on 3/31 down to $24.50 where some shorts may have covered which [I have put a little box around](https://imgur.com/lss7ppj). Why do I say that it is an artificial drop? Because the company absolutely crushed earnings expectations and was trending up the day earnings were released. That premarket drop was clearly induced and may have been an opportunity for some of the shorts to cover with a small profit, but certainly not the majority. I believe SI% is still very high and there is a **squeeze to be squoze**. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nSome may attribute the drop in price on 3/31 to the **IPO lockup expiration**. If you don't know what lockup expiration means, \n&nbsp;\n\n\n>When a company goes public through a traditional IPO, it usually sets a lock-up period of 90 to 180 days during which insiders can't sell their shares. That rule isn't mandated by the Securities and Exchange Commission -- it's a self-imposed one that prevents big investors from flooding the market with shares.\n&nbsp;\n\n\nSo, the lockup  expired and insiders can sell their shares, but why would they? They just beat earnings by a lot and should expect their shares to continue to increase in value. Also, there were further restrictions placed on insider sales that a commenter on another ASO DD thread made. I'm assuming it was valid research. Hopefully they can add it to this post because I don't have the full details, but essentially there is a still limit on how much the insiders can sell at one time as to no shift the price too much and that limit is 1% of the company's value. With a $2.64B market cap right now, that is $26.4M, or about 900,000 shares being the limit on insider sales in a day.  It is entirely possible that the lockup expiry was the cause of the 3/31 drop, which would mean that it was not artificial and it was not a plan by shorts to cover. Meaning SI% is still in the 35-45% range. \n\n&nbsp;\n \n**THE STOCK IS UNDERVALUED**\n\n&nbsp;\n \n[According to Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/results-academy-sports-outdoors-inc-052048433.html) the consensus price target is $32. [Simply Wall St](https://imgur.com/Y95DfqK) has a fair value estimate of $49.99. Prior to the company beating EPS expectations by 76%, I was seeing discounted cash flow values of $35/share. [GuruFocus has DCF value at $36.29](https://www.gurufocus.com/stock/ASO/dcf). The price has been depressed. Watching the charts for the last month, there have been pretty massive sell walls in the $25 - $29 range, with order books full of those suspicious algorithm share #'s keeping the price from going up to its fair value naturally. With price targets that have not been fully updated for the earnings beat and increasing volume being between $28 - $35, it seems that the worst case scenario is buying in at $30 will net about a 10% gain or loss. That is attractive to boomers, which could increase retail volume.  \n \n&nbsp;\n\nDid someone say **volume**? Average volume was around 1.5M. Since earnings were released there has been an increase in volume: \n \n&nbsp;\n\n|Date|Volume|Over/(Under) Average|\n--:|:--|:--|\n|26-Mar| 775,000| (725,000)|\n|29-Mar| 2,390,000| 890,000|\n|Earnings Release 30-Mar| 4,880,000| 3,380,000|\n|Lockup Expiry 31-Mar| 5,040,000| 3,540,000|\n|1-Apr| 3,610,000| 2,110,000|\n\n&nbsp;\n \nPrice at open on the day of earnings release was $24.98. It closed on 4/1 at $29.01 for a 16% increase and kept going up after hours another $1 or another 4%. \n \n&nbsp;\n\nLet's see that in a table: \n\n|Date|Open|Close|% Change since earnings||\n:--|--:|--:|--:|:--|\n|26-Mar|23.92|24.59|||\n|29-Mar|24.98|24.23|-3.0%||\n|30-Mar|24.59|26.74|7.0%||\n|31-Mar|25.79|27.05|8.3%||\n|1-Apr|27.08|29.01|16.1%||\n|After Hours|29.01|30.00|20.1%||\n\n&nbsp;\n \nNow, I said previously that this stock reminds me of RKT. Strong earnings release for a heavily shorted stock and a delayed increase in price due to massive resistance. That resistance was overcome for RKT from massive buying volume as retail jumped on board. Volume really picked up and the RKT flew. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n \n|Date|Open|Close|% Change since earnings|\n--:|--:|--:|--:|\n|25-Feb|20.33|19.9|-2.1%|\n|26-Feb|23.33|21.85|7.5%|\n|1-Mar|23|24.3|19.5%|\n|2-Mar|27.34|41.6|104.6%|\n \n&nbsp;\n \nI'm not saying that ASO will have a 100% gain this week, but if you look at what's been happening in 2021 (RKT, AMC, Discovery?), when a stock gets attention and momentum with a high SI%, it is entirely possible to jump 100% in a day. ASO seems similar to RKT in terms of having low float, high short interest, consistently beating earnings, and absolute price. The price point is really important here. Most jabronis can afford to buy into a $30 stock. \n  \n&nbsp;\n\n**Indicators** \n \nI don't put a ton of faith in traditional indicators because we live in the Upside Down now, but MACD and RSI both look very promising, with MACD [on the 3-month chart](https://imgur.com/unGgIgg) \"crossing over\" into positive territory on 3/30. This is a bullish sign for the chart watchers. RSI on the daily, weekly, and monthly charts is over 70. Also a bullish indicator. \n\n&nbsp;\n \n**Conclusion** \n&nbsp;\n\nFor me, personally, I think ASO is primed to have a big day this week if it volume gets high enough. By big day I mean spiking to anywhere from $45 - $60 before settling back into $35 - $40 and then slowly growing. If it goes any higher than $60 I will definitely be throwing a pizza party for my local store. \n \n&nbsp;\n \n\nThanks for reading my post. Good luck out there.
