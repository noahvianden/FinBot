{"title": "COIN is oversold on \"fee compression\" and is getting no credit for their cloud service.", "selftext": " I keep seeing articles promoting the idea that Coinbase is just an exchange, and is therefore overvalued due to near term fears of fee compression. \n\n This logic is erroneous on a few points:\n\n1. Coinbase customers care more about security than low fees. Even today there are exchanges you can use to save money on trading fees. They're still raking in cash on trading volumes and growing customers and assets on platform. This is going to continue because the coinbase brand carries a lot of trust. At least here in the US, it feels like common knowledge that coinbase is the safest place for your assets, analysts aren't giving them enough credit for this.\n2. Coinbase brings more utility to the table than other exchanges. Syncing with their wallet and earn services for example, is starting to feel like being sucked into the Apple ecosystem. It's too damn convenient, users won't leave. If you think they won't continue releasing value-add-services over time then you're just as retarded as your username suggests.\n3.  AND MOST IMPORTANTLY; Coinbase isn't just an exchange. They're a tech company, and they're leveraging the work they've done that interacts with the underlying technologies and exposing them as an API; and guess what, they're going to make more money on this in 5 years than their trading fees (so says me). If you believe in the \"internet money\" economy, then you also believe there is a tidal wave of startups around the corner, and that all over the world people will start getting paid with \"internet money\" (instead of gum). If you're an entrepreneur, and especially if you're a developer who values their time, you're not going to work on stuff that's out of scope, you're just going to plug in something you can trust.\n\nI literally haven't seen anyone talking about this, I think investors will wake up to it in the 2nd half of this year.\n\nMaybe after Q2 earnings release if Coinbase cloud revenue is non-zero.\n\nIf you haven't listened to the Q1 Earnings call (of course you haven't) you really should.\n\nI really don't see any legitimate competition to Coinbase, there are many exchanges, but Coinbase is building something much more important. In my mind the only real risk facing Coinbase is that the entire \"internet money\" economy never materializes and we just keep using fiat forever. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i6uvkhengva71.png?width=742&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3ef1d069c8dae354c70e04ab09357eff655e940", "id": "oj3yb4", "created_utc": 1626135003.0, "score": 38, "upvote_ratio": 0.68, "num_comments": 73, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|2|**First Seen In WSB**|7 minutes ago\n**Total Comments**|0|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oj3thl/coin_is_oversold_on_fee_compression_and_is/) \n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n    \nHey /u/TRDPROguy69, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2568979561328888}, {"body": "Buy COIN once Cathie sells.", "score": 22, "replies": [{"body": "Pretty soon you\u2019ll be able to buy cathie for mere coins.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "My 200 reddit coins \ud83e\ude99 are ready", "score": 5, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3928857147693634}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5776256918907166}, {"body": "sry but why wait until cathy sells? she also does not seem like ark would sell anytime soon?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Usually the price tanks after she sells, so it creates a good entry point.
