{"title": "F \u2014 BUY NOW!!", "selftext": "I don\u2019t have any fancy graphs for this, but please feel free to double check what I\u2019m saying on TradingView or whatever chart viewing service you retards enjoy.\n\nAs I\u2019m typing this, Ford\u2019s daily candlestick pattern is a Long Upper Shadow which means the buy zone will be these next couple days for those of you looking for a good buy signal. \n\nEnough rendezvous and fruity chit chat, here comes the juiciness.\n\nImportant Specs:\n\nIntrinsic Value: >$24 which means Ford is wildly undervalued right now at $14.44. So, solely based on company value, Ford is a huge buy.\n\nEV: Ford is not only entering the EV market but is overhauling their current fleet with EV cars. The F-150 has over 100k pre-orders. The Mach-E just got named EV car of the year. Look for Ford to be the cheaper alternative to Tesla in the US EV Market.\n\nSMA50: The SMA50 is in a nice uptrend right now and with the positive earnings call, Ford hit the SMA50 resistance early Thursday, look for Ford to bust through that in the coming weeks.\n\nOptions Activity: There is extremely high volume and open interest on the $20 1/21/22 calls which are priced at $0.36 right now. Pretty cheap if you ask me.\n\nFrankly I don\u2019t understand a bearish outlook on Ford right now. All signs point to the Moon.\n\nI am not a financial adviser, just a retarded ape who picked up trading at the start of the pandemic, so if you\u2019re smart probably load up on Ford puts cause I\u2019m stoopid.\n\nPosition: 50 calls @ $21 (1/21/22)\n\nEdit: I just saw my user report and thought who tf is this guy, and then realized it was my user report.
