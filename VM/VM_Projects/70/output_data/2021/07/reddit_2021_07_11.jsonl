{"title": "Expected moves. SPCE, TSLA JPM, GS, BAC, WFC and more.", "selftext": "### The Broader Markets\n\n**Last Week \u2013** **SPY** finished last week inside its expected move, up 0.5% vs the 0.7% options were pricing. However, markets moved lower Thursday before a rally to end the week. That move lower briefly took options implied volatility higher.\n\n**This Week \u2013 SPY** options are pricing about a **1%** move (in either direction) for the upcoming week. That corresponds to about **$431** as a *bearish consensus* and **$440** as a *bullish consensus*.\n\n**Implied Volatility** \u2013 The VIX was slightly higher on the week closing above 16. That was lower than the levels above 20 it saw Thursday morning.\n\nLooking out on the VIX futures curve, December VIX futures are about 22.5. Near-term options remain compressed, while expectations of future volatility (and therefore latter month option prices) are trading higher.\n\nThose looking for near-term hedges will find options prices on the inexpensive side historically, and the least expensive in over a year. Those implementing short premium strategies near term (covered calls, iron condors, credit put/call spreads etc.) will find the premiums (or ranges that they are selling) tighter than they have been in over a year.\n\n**Expected Moves for This Week** (via Options AI)\n\n* SPY **1%**\n* QQQ **1.5%**\n* IWM **1.8%**\n* DIA **1.2%**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n### In the News\n\nThe Virgin Galactic flight with Richard Branson went off successfully. **SPCE** options are pricing about a **22%** move for this week.\n\nThere was a lot of attention paid to **Tesla TSLA** chart technicals and momentum last week. Here\u2019s how the options market is pricing TSLA, with a one week expected move of more than **4%** and a one month expected move (that includes earnings) of about **12%.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n### Expected Moves for Companies Reporting Earnings\n\nEarnings season begins with some of the major financial institutions kicking off things this week. Big tech reports later in the month.\n\nLinks go to the Options AI Calendar, free to use.
