Is energy/utility being a relatively small part of index funds make this a smaller deal than I think it is?\n\nMy back of the napkin math: My understanding is around 50% of US assets under management are held in passive index funds, if the US has 42T in AUM, 21T are in index funds. Of those funds, Energy and utilities represents 4-7% of that, so thats $840B - $1.4T. If Tesla somehow ends up taking the lion's share of those funds at conservatively 10% in the next 10-20 years, (Exxon and Chevron can take up to 23 and 20% of some of those funds) that would take $84B-140B of Tesla's market cap (13%-22% of shares outstanding at today's prices) and be tied up under passive management. Which should drive up the price to some degree right?\n\nTony Seba's video says there are 2.2T invested in conventional and soon to be stranded energy assets, but Tesla should only count towards US index funds, even though they operate worldwide, the company would only be held in US index funds. Or is my $21T math off because even though its 42T AUM, people in the US have international exposure that I'm incorrectly including.\n\nIsn't this a big deal or are the holes in my math too big?", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "hadn't thought about that, thank you.

As a result, the price of Chinese LFP batteries has always been considerably lower than non-Chinese LFP batteries. However, the patents\u2019 restrictions over LFP will start to expire in 2022. Simultaneously, the limitation of LFP exports on Chinese producers will be largely removed, along with the licensing fee for non-Chinese LFP cell producers.

Tesla also wanted to reduce the reliance of large numbers of random installers instead of carefully vetted installation partners and their own teams. It was another downside of the Solar City approach, with things like installation mistakes by less qualified installers leading to problems (a common problem through all construction).\n\nThat saving of 21% cost could be put to margin and lowering price. After the switch, installation rates plunged even more because even people from accounting at HQ were pulled in to work on saving the Model 3. That was a temporary effect though. Installations have been steadily increasing since then, without the crazy overhang of the INDUSTRY AVERAGE of 20% for just customer acquisition.\n\nThere is a reason about 85% of shareholders voted for the acquisition.
