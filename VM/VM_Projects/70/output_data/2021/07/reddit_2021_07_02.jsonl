{"title": "Losing my money and trying to enjoy options", "selftext": "I recently learned how to buy and sell options after months of attempting to learn them. I\u2019ve bought and sold only 5 contracts totaling around $500 in the last two weeks and almost all have been huge losses, with one being held for a day and having me run off with $25. I did some research, utilized options profit calculator to see how I\u2019d stand, bought options both far OTM and ITM, and even options with a week out or month out expiry date. It feels like no matter what I do, I\u2019ll never make a profit bigger than $50-$100.\n\nThe main thing throwing me off is the strike price. If I\u2019m looking at AAPL and say it\u2019s at $130, and I think that in two weeks it could reasonably be at $135, as I\u2019ve seen an uptrend over the last year and months. So I\u2019d pick a date two weeks out, set a call for a 135 strike and boom I\u2019m in. But because of decaying time and extrinsic (I forget if that\u2019s the right one but you get it) value dying off, it feels like even if I hit $134 or something close, even $136, due to the time decay I\u2019m barely making money if not negative.\n\nWhat parameters do you guys use when buying normal calls or puts? How far out do you set your expiry dates based on what stocks you\u2019re trading options with? How ITM or OTM do you typically set your strike prices?

Before then the option will have extrinsic value, but that decays every day. Hence, it's a race. This is why buying a call that is at $170 would not be a good idea, even if AAPL were to shoot up to $160, the $170 likely could still be worthless. OTM options lose value on delta as well as time goes by, meaning that the closer to expiration and the further OTM, the less value the option has. For example, a week out, the $150 option might have a delta of 0.2 and extrinsic value of $0.50. A day out, and the $150 option (let's say AAPl stays flat and is at $135), that $150 strike option will likely have a delta of 0.05 (something quite low) and a value of $0.10. If you're that close to expiration, then if AAPL were to increase by $10, you'd still see the option only go up by $0.5, whereas when the delta was 0.2, a $10 increase would be result in a $2.00 increase in the option value.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Yea this is a lot to understand, but breaking it down slowly definitely makes more sense. Thanks for the write up, might take a break from options until I can buy more ITM ones or covered calls", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Oomph, re-reading my last post here, the explanation was not good. I'll try one better.\n\nFirst, you need to understand 'delta'. That is the amount by which the option will change in value for every one dollar change in stock value. Stock have a 'delta' of 1, the stock goes up by one dollar, the stock asset goes up by one dollar as well. Options will instead go up by a fraction. For example, with a delta value of '0.5', then if the stock goes up by $1, then the option contract goes up by $0.5.\n\nPicture a graph where the 'x' axis is stock price and 'y' axis is delta. Let's say the stock price is at the center of this graph. Delta will look like a plateau on the left hand side and then will start to drop off pretty quickly as you cross the stock price and then will drop off more quickly as you get farther out. That is to say very deep ITM options will have a delta close to '1', then delta will decrease as you approach the money (where the stock price currently is). Then once you get out the money, delta will drop off. How quickly delta drops off is a function of how far out expiration is. The further out expiration, the more shallow the drop off. This makes sense, if you have a lot of time, there is more chance for the stock to hit the strike price. If I'm holding an AAPL that is $20 OTM and 2 years out, there is a really good chance it'll be worth something. It then makes sense if the underlying were to move by $10, then that option price would go up by a decent amount (relatively high delta). But OTOH, if that option were to expire in 1 hour, then it does not really matter if that option were to become only $10 OTM, it's still unlikely to be worth anything. \n\nIt's similar to a sprint vs a very long race. Let's say someone is trying to break the 100 yard dash record. If that person is running really really fast, but they still have to run even faster impossibly fast, like they still have to double their speed, then even if they are running super fast it doesn't matter because they are not running fast enough. The option with the strike that is at the finish line is still not going to be worth much because that runner is still unlikely to hit it, even though they are moving very fast. But, if the runner still had plenty of time, and they were well above world record pace, then the strike they are running to would increase in value substantially because it's likely to be worth something.\n\nSo, as expiration nears, ITM call options have a delta that approaches one and all OTM options have a delta that approaches zero and the sharper the drop off and difference between the delta of  ITM and OTM options. Another way to look at it, if you have 10 minute to expiration, if an call is OTM, then people won't care how much the stock is increasing, with 10 minutes left, if the option is not ITM, then it's probably not worth anything (and delta will be close to zero).\n\nSo, this is why a deep OTM option with short expiration is not necessarily a good idea. You're betting on a faster than world record pace, just basically looking for the impossible.\n\nNow.. theta is the other thing to consider. Theta eats away at extrinsic value (please look up intrinsic and extrinsic value if those two terms do not make sense). Extrinsic value is like a high tide. Theta is how fast the tide goes down. When the tide is all the way out, then there is no more extrinsic value. As time goes by, the tide recedes. How fast the tide goes down is theta. The closer you get to low tide, the faster the tide drops. Thus, theta increases as time goes on and as you approach expiration. At expiration the tide is all the way out and the only thing that remains is intrinsic value.\n\nSo, if you are buying a deep OTM option that is close to expiration, then you are fighting both forces that fight against you, the option is losing a lot of value each day and on top of that needs to increase by a lot before the option price itself will really start to move. These options are therefore cheap because of this.

If Apple stock is $130 dollars right now would you rather buy 100 shares for 130 or would you rather buy those shares for 120 or 125 while the actual price is still 130. Even better, it goes up to 135 and you still get to buy it for a price of 120 or 125 per share. For this situation that\u2019s what call options in its simplest description are doing. Time decay is a whole separate ball game but you need to understand the strike price before anything. So those calls if you had a strike price of 125 right now would let you see some gains because the right to buy 100 shares at 125 when the price is 135 is much more juicy than buying 100 shares at 135 when the price is also 135. So if you want to go ahead and sell that to the market before expiration someone will be willing to buy those and exercise the option to get shares cheaper than current market prices. You could also exercise all your options if you have the capital to do so. I hope that makes much more sense. Options can allow investors to get discount on shares but at a cost. Which is the premium. \n\nNow why the higher strike prices then? Strike prices that are above the current price of the stock are considered out of the money. Meaning the stock has to rise to whatever your strike is plus the premium of one contract to break even. These options are also much much cheaper. You can control much more shares with the same amount of money. Let\u2019s say you bought 145 strike calls or 155 for 2 weeks out, you would find those are extremely cheap compared to the one you bought. The reason is because it\u2019s giving you the right to buy shares at those strikes at expiration. If the stock price is lower than those strikes, however, it only makes sense that they are worthless. Why would you pay 145 for 100 shares when you can still get them for 135. In a two week period you\u2019ll also almost definitely lose your money because Apple doesn\u2019t move that quick. Only use this for fast moving stocks. This is how people get so much money on the meme stocks. Say AMC was at 10. Someone bought calls for 25 strike expiring in 4 months. Instead of using his 5000 dollars to control only 15 contracts. He was able to buy 35-40 contracts. When AMC rockets to 60 now he\u2019s sitting on 40 contracts giving someone the right to buy a 60 dollar stock for only 25 dollars. So his options are worth a tremendous amount. Those are all fictional numbers but made up so it can give you a clear picture. For slow movers always tend to go further out. 6 months to even a year if you want to be safer but still reap a little leveraged returns \n\nJust remember what the option is. It\u2019s a contract. The premium is a derivative from the price of the stock. Just remember you pay a premium based on the strike price and it gives you the right to control 100 shares. By expiration on calls you always want the strike price below the price of the actual shares because that will make the contract worth more. Puts are literally the opposite of that. You want stock price lower than your strike price.", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": ["aapl"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "You are red pilling into becoming a net option seller.
