Ideally the market doesn\u2019t pick up speed til near the expiration of my sold call (which may have been about 6 months away from my leap), and my gains start really adding up. If market goes nowhere, or a little down, my sold call expires worthless and I\u2019d sell another call against my leap, about halfway between current day and expiration again.

My high school classmates voted me \"Most Likely to Lose Virginity at a Massage Parlor in Thailand.\" Please see below my thoughts on the (rather niche) meme stock Bed Bath & Beyond, which trades on the Nasdaq as $BBBY.\n\n**Preface**\n\nI'll admit it. I was initially drawn to this stock by nostalgia. I remember roaming these wide fluorescent aisles as a wonderstruck child, holding my mother's hand and nibbling on a Pokemon card. I remember the smells of the exotic lotions and the textures of the plush towels. It was pure opulence.\n\nBut wankery and nostalgia aside, it is my not-so-humble opinion that there are many, many reasons why this stock is a compelling gamble.\n\n**The Growth Story**\n\n[Delicious](https://preview.redd.it/avkf5a68h5b71.png?width=1670&format=png&auto=webp&s=358bbadfdff8f4693ead770b24612710f8e609b8)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Fresh Faces and Fresher Ideas**\n   * The entire C-Suite was overhauled in 2020. The CEO was hired in November 2019, and literally every other exec was hired in 2020. They are not fucking around\n   * 100% of the Board of Directors were appointed within the last 4 years\n   * All the boomers that milked this company dry as it spiraled downward are gone\n* **Shawty Got Techniques**\n   * The new C-Suite is packed with Retail veterans with specific experience leading digital/e-commerce transformations. These are alumni from the likes of Target, Amazon, Nordstrom, Home Depot, Walgreens, Walmart, J. Crew, and Disney -- companies that have been set up exceptionally well to survive the 21st Century. There's also a Chief Digital Officer now\n   * A quick browse of their job openings show just ambitious the turnaround really is. Open positions include cloud engineers, digital marketers, and warehouse fulfillment staff. They are also hiring beaucoup data scientists to mine consumer insights and optimize their supply chain\n* **Omnipresent AF**\n   * The website is officially an online shop, and has UI/UX for days. They even have an app you can shop with. Only the best of the best retailers have apps, it is known\n   * They do all the things that multi-channel retailers should do, like same day delivery, store and curbside pickup, and free shipping on orders over $39\n   * Wedding and baby registries. Let's face it, these are a social institution that aren't going away. $BBBY is one of the rare few retailers that offers pretty much everything a newly wed couple or a newborn might need\n\n[Scrumptious](https://preview.redd.it/lj6b8uy9h5b71.png?width=2076&format=png&auto=webp&s=86954132b34d8fde7010a2ef3a8ec5395f3b5c4d)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **A Structured Roadmap with Annual Milestones**\n   * The $BBBY transformation is not just a bunch of buzzwords thrown into a vague vision statement. Management is executing on a 3-Year Roadmap that involves cutting costs by going lean and prioritizing investments in digital penetration\n   * It's working: Gross margins increased from 26.7% to 34.9% over the past year. Digital penetration of sales revenue increased from 18% in FY18Q1 to 38% in FY21Q1\n   * Demonstrated results are real, unlike the castles in the sky that speculative SPACs promise\n\n[Spicy!](https://preview.redd.it/kaess0hbh5b71.png?width=2270&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ab0cb209f733ee280c122b78d867fa717e19b7d)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **An Iconic Brand Seared Into The American Subconscious**\n   * This bullet speaks for itself really. You and everyone you know has heard of $BBBY. $BBBY is love. $BBBY is life.\n* **Taking the Shitty Horses Behind the Barn and Shooting Them. Running the Litty Horses in the Races**\n   * Aggressively selling underperforming business units such as Cost Plus World Market, One Kings Lane, and PMall\n   * Aggressively growing overperforming business units such as Buybuy Baby, Harmon, and Decorist\n   * Aggressively investing in the cash cows that are private label brands. Retailers from CostCo to Amazon know how fucking milkable private label brands are for juiced revenues, especially when they're sharing shelf space with more established brands. After all, you are who you spend time with. $BBBY have launched 3 of these brands so far this year, with plans to launch 3 more next quarter. They are aiming for 30% private label sales penetration by FY23\n* **The ESG Boost**\n   * Publicly committed to net zero emissions by 2040\n   * Investing heavily in water efficiency, waste recycling, and sustainable and responsible sourcing throughout their supply chain\n   * They are also investing in diversity, equity, and inclusion in the workplace. This is coming from the top-down, because 7 out of 13 board directors are women and 5 out of 8 C-Suite execs are women and/or BIPOC. ESG investors lap this kinda shit up. Also a McKinsey study found that businesses who outperformed industry peers on racial and ethnic diversity were also statistically likely to outperform financially\n   * The recent boom in impact investing, combined with social pressures on institutional investors, has definitely boosted demand for ESG-oriented stocks. $BBBY is well-positioned to benefit from this trend\n* **Financials**\n   * Positive, growing EBITDA\n   * Extremely healthy cash position of $1.35 Billion. Long-term debt of $1.19B is lower\n   * Free cash flow and operating cash flow are positive and trending upwards. Very bullish\n   * Net income has been negative in recent years but was finally positive in the trailing twelve months. As a result net income margin and operating margin are still relatively low (although positive)\n   * Current ratio of 1.56 is very healthy\n   * Management is confident enough to regularly buy back shares. They clearly care about their shareholders. They used to pay a dividend before COVID as well, but it is not clear if/when this will be reinstated\n* **Potential Catalysts**\n   * A huge catalyst this summer is college shopping as in-person attendance picks up. Thanks to COVID, essentially 2+ years worth of students will be moving out from their parents' place and into college for the first time\n   * The turnaround may be a 3 year plan, but investors will continue to reward the stock as long as management keeps meeting milestones.\n   * All in all, keep an eye out for FY21Q2 earnings in a couple months. Could see a major move upward. I plan to build out my position by then\n   * If inflation is indeed not transitory, and we are headed for a market downturn, people are still going to buy pillows and blankets and shit. Consumer cyclical stocks are good during inflation\n\n**The Bear Case**\n\nUnlike certain bag holders on this sub (cough cough CLOV CLNE WISH cough cough), I can admit that this is definitely a gamble. This is not a sure thing. Upside could be limited, because big money investors are starting to be bullish on the turnaround too.\n\nAnd, of course, the turnaround may fall flat. Amazon exists. Retail/e-commerce is a dog fuck dog world, and Amazon is bigass dog in a smallass doggy day care. Revenue is on a long-term downtrend, and management is yet to demonstrate that they can surpass the performance from the brick and mortar glory days of yore.\n\nAlso, my credibility is suspect. I'm emotional, impulsive, and honestly -- despite my obvious and staggering genius -- I do a lot of dumb shit. So don't just take my word on this. Follow your heart.\n\n**TLDR: If you don't have enough of an attention span to read this post, you probably shouldn't be managing your own money tbh**\n\nSources: FY20 10-K, FY21Q1 10-Q, Company Website, My Self-Destructive Give-Too-Many-Fucks Lifestyle, and Yo Momma So Fat She Was Desperate Enough to Marry Me After Divorcing that Deadbeat Brokeboi You Call Dad\n\nPosition: Not Yet.

{"title": "UPDATE on Market Crashing Soon Positions and an extra simple explanation for the Apes in the back", "selftext": "So I'm the Sir Doom and Gloom Rainbow Bear (actually I identify as a Bull, but the writing on the wall in bright glowing neon crayon is too fucking shiny to ignore anymore) who wrote these [two](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oe9ruu/how_to_play_the_upcoming_market_crash/) [posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/og6ofy/housing_a_big_bubbly_pile_of_garbage_that_will/) about the upcoming crash and how to play it, and why the housing market is fucked.  As many of you noted, my positions listed in those posts that I took out in June were about to be fuckered.  Two days out and I've dumped them for a 99% loss (about $300) and have since taken new ones.  This isn't a LOSS or YOLO post because the $$ amounts aren't remotely high enough.  This is a small side bet for me, most of my money is in stonks that should moon when everything else dies.\n\n10x 9/17 SQQQ 30c @ $0.07 ea\n\n10x 11/19 DOG 50c @ $0.10 ea\n\n10x 1/22/2022 PSQ 35c $0.05 ea\n\nI'll probably get some more SPXS calls for 9/17 soon as well.  I'm staying away from HYG puts for now because there is just some weird shit going on with that.  It's like puts on HYG are working as Wall Street's ENTIRE risk hedging portfolio.  2 MILLION HYG Puts expired worthless on 6/18, which is several billion dollars worth of loss.  Right now there's ANOTHER 1 MILLLION HYG puts set to expire on  7/16 and after that yet ANOTHER 2 million puts set to go off on 9/17.  Actually, pick basically ANY prime options date going forward and you'll find at least a million puts on HYG in open interest.  Basically, for whatever reason, the entire Street and every single risk department on it is using HYG puts as a hedge against market collapse.\n\nA bunch of the big banks have had earnings come out this week so far, and in 2Q - a quarter where SPY went up (depending on what days they count as their 2Q period) around 8%, JPM, Citi, BofA, and Goldman all had revenue declines of 38%-44%.  So for the most recent quarter, the cheaty smart money underperformed the market by as much as 50%.  Yeah, they're holding some real toxic shit that they haven't been able to offload onto their clients yet.  In fact, the only big bank to report better than expected profits so far is Wells Fargo, who you all have at least three accounts at despite never setting foot in one of their buildings and whom Warren Buffett dumped last year and about whom Cramer is saying \"I would buy it aggressively\". Like, if that doesn't set off a british guy saying \"Alarm bells are ringing, Willie\" vibes in your head, nothing will.\n\nTL;DR on market crashes - whatever the particular flavor they come in, they're always caused by **excessive debt**, **excessive leverage**, and **excessive corruption**.  We've got a massive, massive overabundance of all three right now.  Right before massive market crashes, they usually go vertical.  Zoom out to a 40 year SPY chart, or a 100 year SPX chart, and that's the phase we're in right now.  You're not going to time the vertical exit perfectly, once you see it, it's time to leave, buy inverse call options, and slowly lose money until everything goes BOOM the fucking dynamite and then sell for a huge profit and buy the goddamned collapsed black hole of a dip to be rich for life.\n\nPersonally, I'm really liking August 23rd because I see a lot of potential catalysts converging there, but I'm probably wrong and early on the date.", "id": "ok7hsx", "created_utc": 1626278787.0, "score": 64, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "num_comments": 74, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|9|**First Seen In WSB**|5 months ago\n**Total Comments**|109|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/og6ofy/housing_a_big_bubbly_pile_of_garbage_that_will/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oe9ruu/how_to_play_the_upcoming_market_crash/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ok7hsx/update_on_market_crashing_soon_positions_and_an/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mqe5mt/betting_on_oil_gas_and_economic_growth/) \n**Account Age**|5 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4943710267543793}, {"body": "This man so sure the market is going to crash he spent $220.", "score": 133, "replies": [{"body": "Hahahaha I thought the same thing.", "score": 27, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.17406083643436432}, {"body": "Lol, ok, that's pretty good.
