The way it looks \"at this moment\" would make anyone think this.\n\nBut I would suggest that P/E ratios and such are not the right tool to be using to evaluate a company still in its exponential growth phase.  For a mature company this makes more sense but at this point growth rate and trajectory matter more.  The results from this quarter effectively halved their p/e ratio from the 650s to something in the 300s.  If they continue to grow like crazy (>50 percent YoY), this will continue to get cut down.\n\nThe biggest question to ask is are they doing the things they need to do to grow like they need to.  A deep dive into the qualitative aspects of Tesla and comparing that with incumbents will really highlight what many already see.  \n\nI would say even if you absolutely do not believe this random guy on Reddit, you should at least owe it to yourself to do a qualitative dive into the company and see what the fuss is all about.  Solving the money problem, Dave Lee on investing, Tesla daily on YouTube.  Pick some topics about Tesla you're curious about and just give it a watch and see if it makes any sense.\n\nThe addressable market of Tesla is so big that if it is indeed a solid investment as some think, the potential could be huge.  What's the worst that could happen?  Spend a little bit of time over the next days or weeks, but there might just be an inkling of a chance that you might realize you're looking at the next generational company like amazon, apple, etc.\n\nNothing to lose except a little bit of time, but everything to gain if there's even a remote chance that I'm right.", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": ["aapl", "amzn", "tsla"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Or... they're going to grow into their price and beyond it with a near monopoly on some of the best green energy tech in the industry and close to total vertical integration.
