{"title": "Here are the major factors contributing to a very possible market correction soon", "selftext": "I am not a market expert but I have been observing red flags piling up recently and it\u2019s wise to pay close attention to them as they point to a near market correction including:\n\n**Low market breadth and divergence:** there are fewer stocks rising versus ones declining, and a larger number of stocks are hitting the 52 week low than the ones hitting the 52 week high.\n\n**Overbought stocks:** such as AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, NVDA, and ARKK all have recently breached the 70 RSI overbought marker and are now dropping fast. This ties in well with the poor market breadth as allot of the money existing other stocks as they sell off is just pilling in few top stocks in an unstained way, hence the overbought flag.\n\n**Reduced volumes:** signal weakness in the market and provoke profit taking. For example the Russell 2000 average volume has dropped to just under 3 billion per day from a three months average of 3.7 billion. Incidentally this index tracks 2,000 small cap US companies which have been dropping for most of the last 3 weeks for a total decline of 7.3% thus far.\n\n**Major trend line broken:** for the second time in less than one month the S&P 500 has dipped under its major trend line. The first time on May 18th, it reversed and went back up on the back of decent labor and production reports plus earnings expectations. Now that earnings are underway and most economic indicators are pointing to growth peaking it might not be able to reverse the drop.\n\nObviously all of the above are technical indicators that try to explain market behavior based on historical metrics, but they don\u2019t explain the reasons behind such changes. We have to look at economic news to identify causes including:\n\n**Peaking economic recovery:** several reports this month point to an economy that has reached peak recovery. For example, both the services PMI 64.6 vs 65.2 vs 64.8 (actual, forecast, previous) and ISM 60.1% vs 63.3% vs 64.0% reports for June show a declining rate of expansion. Also, industrial production is showing similar pattern 0.4% vs 0.6% vs 0.7%.\n\n**Mixed Q2 banking results:** also point to the same issue above. While the overall figures are up, the details point to absence of loan growth and net interest margin weakness.\n\n**Declining consumer sentiment:** while consumer spending came in higher than expected for the month of June consumer sentiment declined from 85.5 to 80.8. The main driver behind this is inflation.\n\n**Inflation rising:** the FED has been harping on inflation being transitory because of the \u201cbase effect\u201d and some temporary supply constraints. Their timeline for all of that to sort out was few months. Now it\u2019s more than few months and inflation continues to rage registering the highest figures in over a decade with Core CPI (the Fed\u2019s favorite metric) registering 0.9%, the highest increase since 2008.\n\nFurthermore, the PPI (producer price index) also continues to rise at a rate of 1% in June indicating that consumers are still going to see higher prices in the coming months and that overall inflation will overshoot the FED\u2019s 2% threshold by a wide margin.\n\n**Reemergence of a new variant:**  the delta variant is causing allot of lock downs and interruption throughout the world. While its effect in the US might be limited, a slowing world economy does not bode well for stocks in general, hence perhaps the reason why bonds have gone up.\n\n**Bond yields going down:** usually indicates that an economy is slowing and investors are looking for safer assists. Many have pointed out that bond yields usually peak 3 months in advance of the stock which they did in March. Since we are in July and bond yield continue to decline many think the bond market is sniffing out something and reacting to it. Remember, the inverse relation between bonds and yields.\n\n**China\u2019s Crack on tech:** has rattled some investors especially that it came at a time when that market was showing sign of bottoming out.\n\nAll of those events point to a possible correction sometime in the near future. Most experts expect that sometime after Q2 earnings, but it could be starting as we speak, especially that corrections don\u2019t play out in one straight line. They tend to move in a series of several lower lows and lower highs until bottoming out.\n\nIt\u2019s important to also point out that a correction is not a market crash. Corrections are a much smaller event, ranging around a -10% drop on the low end for the leading S&P 500 index and much more for individual speculative stocks. They are a healthy event that helps reinvigorate the market with new buyers.\n\nA crash on the other hand is a much larger event that\u2019s usually provoked by a combination of events or a single major event. Crashes usually last much longer than people expect, well past the initial large drop.\n\nThere are several catalysts for such an event such as the emergence of a virus variant that outsmarts vaccines or a collapse in the reverse repo facility. The most prominent of them however, is QE tapering (quantitative easing) and increase in interest rates.\n\nMassive QE and low interest rates have been the driving force behind this bull market. They are the justification given for the current astronomical valuation where the S&P500 Shiller P/E ratio is reaching a whopping 38%! That is a historic high only second to the Dotcom bubble in 2000 (44%) and is in general an unsustainable level in the long term.\n\nSome argue that the FED will manage to taper QE and increase interest rates gradually in a very controlled manner and avoid any meltdown, but given rising inflation beyond expectations, the FED might very well be forced to act much sooner than it would like.

{"title": "Robinhood IPO DD ($HOOD).", "selftext": "[See full prospectus here, ](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1783879/000162828021013318/robinhoods-1.htm)which includes one key point that the founders of Robinhood Baiju Bhatt and Vladimir Tenev have special Class B shares that give them 10 times voting power. The shares you buy are voteless Class C shares which can be upgraded to normal one-vote Class A shares on a case by case basis. In other words, Robinhood tells all the corporate raiders to bug off.\n\nThe growth of the company has been huge. Revenue [growing by 309%](https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/how-robinhoods-explosive-growth-rate-came-to-be/#:~:text=The%20fintech%20unicorn's%20revenue%20grew,a%20gain%20of%20around%20309%25.) between 2019 and July 1st. The amount of hate mail they get, poor reviews, SEC fines, growing competition from other low-commission brokers, and at least one guy indiscriminately assaulting Robinhood employees this past year has not stopped new accounts from coming in. From 7.2 million in March 2020 to 18 million [as of July 1st.](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/01/robinhood-has-18-million-accounts-managing-80-billion-after-rapid-one-year-growth-ipo-filing-shows.html) This growth has occurred despite many veteran users leaving the platform.\n\nThe reason for these trends can be found by how the average Robinhood user is:\n\n1. 31 years old.\n\n2. Has an account size of $4,500 (compared to E-Trade's $100,000).\n\n3. Is a buy-and-hold investor (only 2% of accounts are flagged PDT).\n\n4. Has 2 positions.\n\n5. Did not have any investment account before Robinhood.\n\nYou see how Robinhood has become the Walmart of Stock Brokers, making money off economies of scale and the least common denominator. Robinhood's easy to use platform should continue to be millions of young people's first introduction to stocks for many decades.\n\nAnother point is Robinhood is now offering early IPO access. This is where they, as an institutional investor, buy large blocks of IPO starter shares and immediately resell them for a little more to their clients. The benefit of this is normally small orders don't have a chance of getting filled during an IPO.\n\nOne oddity from this is that Robinhood is, AS OF THIS MOMENT, offering their own shares on the app. The funny thing is, the many Robinhood users here can be sure your buy order will be filled during the IPO because their broker is making a huge amount of money selling you shares and if nothing else they can create more shares in order to sell them to you. I don't know for a fact they are planning to do that, though.\n\nRobinhood is making roughly $2.2 billion a year as of right now and is seeking a valuation of $35 billion. Making for a starting PE Ratio of about 16. I give it a long term buy recommendation...

These clearing houses require brokers to post 1-4% cash collateral for every trade in case of failures to deliver, and by Federal law brokers must use their own money to do so. Brokers have deals with investment banks to instantly lend them money when needed for collateral (this is also where the money for margin trading comes from).\n\nThere are also stock/option dealers who post two prices, one what they buy for and another slightly higher what they'll sell for. They constantly adjust these prices so that buy/sells are roughly equal and they profit from the \"bid-ask spread.\" These guys provide liquidity for a living and the stock price you see on google is simply the average price all the thousands of dealers charge.\n\nVital point: None of these guys give a rip about your dank trades and the GME squeeze broke this whole system.\n\nThe dealers couldn't update their prices to keep up with volume, causing them to lose money quickly and trading halts happened to catch up. This meant a lot of trades were not filled at any price.\n\nThe clearing corporation, seeing the pending failures to deliver coming, raised collateral requirements on meme stocks to 100%. Again, these back office people COULD NOT CARE LESS about your trades.\n\nRobinhood saw a spike of people buying GME shares, many borrowing to do so. Robinhood was near getting margin called, effectively closing the business never to recover. Vlad Tenev, who again DOES NOT CARE ABOUT YOUR TRADES, did the obvious thing and froze buying on meme stocks until he could borrow enough money. They managed to make several deals in a few days and raised borrowing caps from one billion to four billion.
