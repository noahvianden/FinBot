Yes, you could calculate based on the underlying and all the Greeks what a fair price might be. But it\u2019s subjective because you may think it\u2019s a bargain and in an hour you\u2019ll have profits and someone is thinking the exact opposite. (Really the same for stocks, could calculate p/e for instance but what ratio is fair to you?) I\u2019ll often buy at the ask to get a quick fill because I\u2019m anticipating a move in my favor. The difference of a few cents makes no difference to me when I\u2019m a few dollars in profit.\n\nI know that\u2019s a really simple explanation but if you were to watch the price of an option on an active trader/price ladder you would clearly see that option pricing works the same way. It is way more volatile as well, because it relies so much on predictions. I\u2019ve seen option contracts move wildly in one direction or another simply because it is a key level, but hardly move in other areas. For instance if a stock is looking to break through a previous high the options will get juiced up because so many are anticipating a move higher. (Usually a great time to sell because this is probably to trick people and fail the breakout to collect premium). Or one I\u2019ve also seen a lot, an option price will tumble when the stock just barely dips below a support just to then move higher and all those contracts being sold for cheaper and cheaper just get swept right up and then they shoot up. It\u2019s honestly pretty crazy, I would guess option pricing has MORE to do with buyers/sellers than shares. In fact in somewhat illiquid options, you can move the price just by bidding higher or asking lower because everyone will see you and the amount of contracts being bought or sold at one given time usually isn\u2019t that much. So if you bid up, sellers will see your bid and move their ask higher, and if you just keep bumping up one tick they will too. Seriously, I have done this on both sides. This doesn\u2019t happen with shares as much although it can happen especially at extreme highs or lows, or overnight, where liquidity starts to dry up.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Options have infinite supply.
