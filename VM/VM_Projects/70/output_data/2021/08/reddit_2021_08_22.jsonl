At the \"end\" (like Microsoft now, 1T+ of cap), your company will have enough power and money to grow monopolies on many markets as it thinks it will benefit its business. And almost nothing can drop the share price, especially when big funds and investors buy out any dropdowns, with help of free and unlimited money the biggest guy provide (the Fed). The bigger your company is, the bigger piece of free money you'll get, and this is a system with  highly positive feedback, and it can runs almost infinitely.

{"title": "BioNTech & Moderna - Vaccine/mRNA unicorns", "selftext": "  \n\n**BioNTech & Moderna - Vaccine/mRNA unicorns**\n\nI was motivated to make this DD post because while these vaccine stocks have been crazy hot over the past year, they don't get much attention on WSB which is a bit surprising.  These aren't for the faint of heart, but traders looking for volatility, you won't need a blue pill to get hard.\n\nI will try to highlight some of the key differences and you can make a choice of which you prefer.  My personal choice is BioNTech, reason being they are much cheaper when comparing financial metrics, and also because I think their vaccine is the best in terms of safety and efficacy.  It is also what I'm vaccinated with, and the 5G reception has been great.\n\n**Pfizer & BioNTech partnership**\n\nMost folks refer to BioNTech\u2019s vaccine as \u2018Pfizer\u2019, but the vaccine actually belongs to BioNTech, but licensed to Pfizer with profit split down the line in most regions as well as milestone payments to BioNTech ($748 million).  There is also a small equity investment in BioNTech by Pfizer.  Pfizer was interested in acquiring BioNTech, but the owners have no interest in selling. \n\n**Making history as the first FDA approved mRNA vaccine**\n\nIn recent news from Friday, Pfizer/BioNTech is to become the first fully FDA approved vaccine as early as this Monday. First mover advantage is key to locking down market share, as well as advancing the mRNA vaccine booster approvals. With the mRNA technology platform vetted with an FDA approval, Pfizer/BioNTech will be moving yet further ahead of the competition.  Mandates will start soon as this is approved, and BioNTech will be the first choice.  Also, BioNTech is in more arms, and the boosters are advised to follow the primary shots so they will also lock up a lot of doses.\n\nModerna approval is said to be several weeks away, so they aren't far behind either if things go their way.\n\nComparing BioNTech and Moderna based on market cap and financial metrics, Moderna currently has a higher valuation/multiple even though BioNTech has double the earnings per share. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Fundamentals](https://preview.redd.it/87y6mjkiuti71.png?width=802&format=png&auto=webp&s=081f5a5bcff8974ec6fc8721bf1f60d91dcbe7be)\n\nFor the next ten years, the COVID vaccine revenues will be the drivers for these companies. I won\u2019t go into the scientific differences between the mRNA vaccines, as this is WSB and I\u2019m not epidemiologist or scientist. \n\nWe know both vaccines are very similar and effective but differ by dosage (Pfizer having 30 micrograms vs Moderna having 100 micrograms per dose). Both of these will require boosters for the foreseeable future with what looks like 8 month intervals (though Moderna may have longer durability due to the dosage). Science supports this since the virus will continue to mutate. Countries such as Canada have already ordered boosters for the entire population out to 2024. \n\n**Ownership and Insiders**\n\nBioNTech is 50% owned by the Str\u00fcngmann brothers, who seeded the company. Next the CEO Ugur Sahin owns around 17% of the company. This means 67% of the stock is basically out of the picture. These guys have not sold a single share as this has run up from single dollars to $465.\n\nInstitutional ownership as of the last report was approximately 17%. This means that 84% of the shares (out of 241 million) are not being actively traded, leaving a paltry 38.5 million shares. \n\nModerna while having more shares outstanding has a very strong institutional ownership base of 64% of float, and 10% by insiders, so 74% of the shares are spoken for. Since Moderna is an S&P component (BioNTech is a German company, listed as an ADR so does not qualify for it), it gets more volume and institutional interest. In the last six months, about 11 million shares have been sold by insiders, which is not unusual given how well it has performed. \n\nFrom a share structure perspective, I think the low float and high ownership by the founders of BioNTech make it possible for more upside, but both are currently Wall Street darlings, and Moderna gets more attention in the media.\n\n**Marketshare**\n\nPfizer distributes the vaccine to 165 countries around the world. The net profit from the sale of the vaccine is split 50/50 between Pfizer and BioNTech. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[More primary shots = more boosters](https://preview.redd.it/7v8rld7puti71.png?width=798&format=png&auto=webp&s=27e11bdcc618de17192efb61d7b2b0defc7660ee)\n\nBioNTech separately has a deal with China based Fosun Pharmaceuticals to distribute in Asia. Fosun is to start production in China at the end of August upon administrative approval (regulator approval already happened last month), eventually producing up to 200 million doses a month to supply Asia. Pfizer/BioNTech did not take US government money to develop their vaccine, which makes it an exception. BioNTech did get $445 million from Germany for the development.\n\nModerna has a smaller reach currently than Pfizer/BioNTech in terms of global distribution and have had some issues scaling fast enough to meet contracts.  However, they are expecting to produce 800-900 million doses for 2021, and up to 3 billion in 2022. Moderna had significant funding by the US Government ($6 Billion), so they are not in a good position to attempt raising prices in the US (though I have heard they may have recently, not sure).  \n\nPfizer/BioNTech wins the distribution hands down, as they were first to launch and scale their production in mass. Also in the US, the BioNTech is able to be given to ages 12 and up, whereas Moderna is currently 18 and over. This could change, but recent reports suggest BioNTech is perhaps a better choice for younger folks due to fewer side effects compared to Moderna, perhaps due to the difference in dosage.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mquq3u4tuti71.png?width=681&format=png&auto=webp&s=cca23b35d7b1f16116f780d58fa930d6e2e6657a\n\n**Pipeline**\n\nFor pipeline, they both have a lot of treatments under development based on mRNA technology. They both are going to be very cash rich, and will have no issues funding and expediting their candidates with no financing concerns for the foreseeable future. Now that they\u2019ve proven mRNA delivery technology and safety, they are both targeting blockbuster drugs (cancer, HIV).  They will also grow via acquisitions.\n\nBioNTech pipeline has a heavy focus on oncology, 21 or 27 of their candidate are cancer related. They also have another partnership with Pfizer to develop a flu shot which started Phase 1 earlier this year. BioNTech has one drug in the phase 2 stage - BNT122 for metastatic melanoma.\n\nModerna has a more diversified pipeline (HIV, Zika, Flu). They just started human trial of their HIV vaccine.  They also have a treatment for cytomegalovirus that is expected to begin phase 3 trials in 2021, and in phase 2 have a cancer vaccine mRNA-4157, to be given in combination with Merck\u2019s Keytruda.\n\n**Technicals**\n\nBioNTech has consenus of $320.44 and Moderna $276.45, but these includes some older targets which have yet to be updated.  BioNTech has had multiple upgrades over the past two weeks ($450 Canaccord, $433 Goldman).  Moderna has recent targets of $425 by Jeffries and $461 by Goldman.  \n\nBoth of these stocks are extremely volatile.  They went parabolic in recent months and got overbought.  They both fell 30% from recent highs in a matter of days, but are now consolidating and inching up again. The selling of these were not based on any fundamental news, but technically the vertical move couldn't be sustained. Earnings blowout and some criticism by some analysts on valuation are mentioned as catalysts, but I think they just went up too far, too fast. This is a run of the mill correction, but I suspect it has now run it's course.  It's given a great opportunity for new investors to get in at a discount to recent highs.\n\nKeep in mind they both have high correlation to each other, so they almost always move together, but MRNA has outperformed BNTX as of late.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1tdbel5uuti71.png?width=780&format=png&auto=webp&s=35e47c33df3823c1865bf34a98a4ccecd8ee5154\n\nI believe both of these will at least retest all time highs (464 for BNTX, and 497 for MRNA), possibly go even higher if we get another variant after the delta that requires further changes to the vaccine (this is probably more likely that we'll want to admit).  The pipeline for both is promising, and these trade more like tech stocks than biotech since mRNA has proven with the COVID vaccine that it will revolutionize the industry and both of these companies are at the forefront.\n\n**Risks:**  The biggest risk is the variants mutate to something less deadly, less warranting booster shots. In my opinion these stocks will likely peak then decline sometime in early - mid 2022 as the pandemic changes into an epidemic.  There is also risk of competition, but I think these have such a commanding lead, I don't see anyone choosing another vaccine over these, given the billions of doses and FDA approvals they will have ahead of the competition.  Folks are turning down Astrazeneca and JNJ, willing to risk waiting unvaccinated for one of the aforementioned mRNA vaccines.\n\nTDLR for those who can\u2019t be bothered to read:\n\n**In a nutshell:** Both are great plays on COVID and mRNA, especially now that boosters are now seen as durable reoccurring revenues (though they are expected to decline after 2022). Like the flu, we\u2019ll be getting COVID shots many years from now based on science and history (flu pandemic of 1918, we\u2019re still getting shots due to variants and waning immunity, the same issues plaguing us with COVID).  However, BioNTech is fundamentally much better valued than Moderna as the EPS is double that of Moderna, and they have the first mover advantage and brand awareness (due to Pfizer).  \n\n**Disclosure:** I\u2019m not a finance professional, just a retail trader. I own BNTX via call options and have no position in MRNA.
