With brakes applied at 80 MPH, slowing the car to 70 MPH and then releasing the brakes.  The amount of energy absorbed from slowing the car from 80 to 70 MPH is 15 time the amount of energy from 10 mph to 0.  The typical driver will do this a couple times before panicking.  At this point all the stored vacuum for assist is gone, and the brakes have already started to heat up considerably.  So now it takes 10x the pedal force to slow the car, as there's no vacuum assist. If the driver at this point realized all this, and applied all the force they possibly could, they probably could overcome the WOT and bring the car to a halt.  unfortunately, not realizing that they need to apply ridiculous force to the brakes, they only apply normal full braking force.  As a result it's not enough to overcome WOT, and the brakes heat up even more.

{"title": "A guide to options/WSB lingo for new members", "selftext": "I've noticed quite a few people have joined this subreddit in the last month or so. This is great, it means we get new content for the mods to filter through and more DD. Around here we usually post a guide every few months and thought I would take the honor of writing the guide for the last few months.\n\nThis is your opportunity to get better at trading and understanding what we are talking about. \n\n**WSB lingo:**\n\nGUH: An acronym meaning Good Under Heat. When someone says this about someone, it means they are really good at picking stocks during volatile times. If someone replies this to a post (even if the post is negative), go through their history and buy whatever they have posted about as it is almost always a great pick.\n\nYacht Club: Some sort of group of special retards that get their own private group thread. Make sure to downvote this thread whenever you see it. They are awful traders.\n\nDD: Don't do it. This post is advice from someone to NOT buy whatever stock they mention. They attempt to play devil's advocate within their post. This is just bad takes from other people in the sub that they make fun of in their post.\n\n8/24: The date the stock market will crash.\n\n$SEARS: A stock that is so good its like buying Sears in the 60s.\n\n**Options terms:**\n\nCall: Associate this with margin call, aka when your account goes into debt. When you buy a call, you're agreeing to pay the price of the contract x 100 every day until expiry, unless the company goes bankrupt.\n\nPut: Associate this with putting money in your account. It's the opposite of a call. When you buy a put, you're agreeing for the price of the contract x 100 to be deposited into your account every day until expiry unless the company goes bankrupt.\n\nTheta: A multiplier on how much money you will get by buying a contract. Contracts with really high theta are sought after as they multiply your money much more than a contact with low theta.\n\nDelta: How likely you will be to get a margin call. Contracts with high delta are bad because you have a very high risk of getting a margin call.\n\n\nIV: Think of this as getting an IV of cash right into your account (bloodstream).
