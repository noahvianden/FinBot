{"title": "A driver died in a car crash involving a Nio car activated with driver-assistance feature", "selftext": "Shares of Chinese electric-vehicle maker NIO were weak Monday after a fatal accident involving a NIO car with self-driving features.\n\nThe fatal crash of a NIO ES8 sport-utility vehicle took place last week in China. The SUV is equipped with several driver assistance functions, including features enabled by Intel (ticker: INTC) division Mobileye, that enable some forms of autonomous driving. NIO\u2019s driver assistance functions are called NIO Pilot and employ cameras as the so-called eyes of the car.\n\nNIO has other autonomous-driving technology, referred to as NAD, such as radar, lidar\u2014a laser-based radar\u2014and camera vision, as well as computing power provided partly by Nvidia (NVDA) to process all the data points coming at the car.\n\nThe NAD features don\u2019t appear to be available on all NIO vehicles, including the ES8. All autonomous driving systems require the driver to pay attention to the road at all times.\n\nNIO responded to a request for comment with a Weibo post in Chinese. The post indicates the company is cooperating with police regarding the investigation.\n\nThe global automotive industry is still wrestling with regulatory and branding issues surrounding autonomous technology. Self-driving features, such as adaptive cruise control and lane-keeping assistance, make driving safer as long as systems are used as intended. But drivers might rely too much on the features when systems are dubbed pilot or autopilot. Government safety regulators, such as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, are still drafting plans to prepare for the introduction of more advanced self-driving features.\n\nLink: [https://www.barrons.com/articles/nio-stock-price-self-driving-crash-51629118508](https://www.barrons.com/articles/nio-stock-price-self-driving-crash-51629118508)", "id": "p5ulcu", "created_utc": 1629166287.0, "score": 141, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 72, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|8|**First Seen In WSB**|2 months ago\n**Total Comments**|97|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|3 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.22214560210704803}, {"body": "This means its on sale right?", "score": 45, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah, so is $XPEV so everyone should buy lol", "score": 6, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4267314672470093}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.10424234718084335}, {"body": "I\u2019m gonna be bagholding this forever", "score": 72, "replies": [{"body": "Just give it a year tops NIO is the tits", "score": 23, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.17073076963424683}, {"body": "Yup yup yup!", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1468943953514099}, {"body": "Lmao I jumped out as soon as I could break even", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.35242801904678345}, {"body": "Balls deep?", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.15657736361026764}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.009774750098586082}, {"body": "Deaths will happen as self driving comes.
