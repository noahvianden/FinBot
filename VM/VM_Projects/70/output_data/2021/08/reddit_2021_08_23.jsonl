{"title": "Palantir's (PLTR) main bearish thesis- low scalability of the product is simply not true.", "selftext": "PLTR's bears main selling point is the fact that according to them, PLTR's software is too complex and expensive and requires people on site in order to be implemented. That would theoretically limit Palantir's growth and acquisition of new customers and might mean that PLTR will never grow into its valuation. However, I do not agree with them.\n\nHere is my take on this matter. First of all, the fact that PLTR's software is very complex and rather expensive has its benefits. For example, if company x spends a lot of resources and time to integrate PLTR's software into its business operations there will be a very low-chance that they will terminate their contract at least in the mid-term and that is even without taking into account the software's capabillities and the fact that it has the potential to completely transform a company's business. As the CEO himself said : \" We are trying to build the go to OS for the modern enterprise\". Also, it seems that it would be very hard for a PLTR's competitor to emerge, because the barriers for entry are very high. (Palantir spend nearly 20 years and billions of dollars developing their product). We can't say the same thing about other soft. companies that offer way simpler solutions.\n\nNow, let's talk about scalability. The main advantage that other generously valued companies like SNOW \"have over\" PLTR.  Well,. things are actually starting to change very fast. A lot of people do not know this, but everytime when PLTR enters a new industry it learns about the specific needs the companies in this industry have and that greatly helps with scalalbility. On the earnings call, they said that one of the largest european banks with over 10000 branches came to them with some problem related to money-laundering and they managed to solve it in just 2 days, while in the past it would have taken them months. Furthermore, they have recently started partnerships with other companies which will also help with the faster adoption of their software. They have put Foundry on the IBM and Amzn clouds and they have also successfully integrated BlackSky's software on top of Foundry for a government project related to geospatial intelligence. Last, but not least they have a started a new program pointed towards smaller innovative companies in which they are offering their software on a subscription-based model. That not only opens a completely new market for them, but the best thing is that on the earnings call thay have said that when implementing their software with those companies, they did not need to send forward deployed engineers and all the work was done remotely.\n\nTL:DR: Not only is Palantir trying to create a software that could be transcendental for any company, they are taking steps to make its adoption as easy and as fast as possible.", "id": "pa8veq", "created_utc": 1629752829.0, "score": 214, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 78, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|59|**First Seen In WSB**|7 months ago\n**Total Comments**|508|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p3bi5c/palantirpltr_literally_went_to_space_short_dd_on/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mfr62k/palantir_pltr_is_a_low_bottom_company_and_has/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n9ydod/palantirs_pltr_fundamentals_just_became_even/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nxra0u/dd_on_cleveland_cliffsclf_a_wsb_favourite_that_is/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwca8e/apple_might_report_historic_earnings_on_27th/) \n**Account Age**|4 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n    \nHey /u/prettyboyv, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.26956942677497864}, {"body": "PLTR is just Cyberdyne IRL.

Complex and expensive software doesn't necessarily limit growth or the acquisition of new customers. The problem is that PLTR is being valued as a massive B2C business. \n\nPalantir's software requires customization to the client's needs and a huge service component to keep it up. That adds highly skilled labor to the mix, thus limiting margins. The same goes for selling the product. It's not shrink wrapped software. The proof is that they had to partner with IBM to sell it. When a company partners with IBM to sell its software, it means that the sales cycle is long (months/years) and that the sales reps need to wine and dine their targets along the way until the order is secured. That's the expertise IBM is bringing to the table.\n\nThis is how the enterprise software business works and there's nothing wrong with that. SAP, Siemens, Salesforce, Microsoft, and bunch of others make good money out of enterprise software sales. But the diference is that they have massive and diversified B2B applications and that most have a B2C or B2P (biz to professional) element.\n\nI rooted for PLTR at the IPO and made a few bucks along the way because it had a flamboyant CEO and the ticker got into the meme train as most tech companies were insanely valuated.
