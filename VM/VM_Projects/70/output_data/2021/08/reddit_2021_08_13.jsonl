Taxes eat gains. It\u2019s more cost effective to rebalance by adding than it is to sell and reposition. You could think of the true cost of a stock you bought with money from selling out of a position as stock price + taxes owed from the sale. \n\n3. When you look at stocks for long term holds, think about where you believe they\u2019ll be 5, 10, 20 years forward. That will be more important than how they moved this week. \n\n4.
