{"title": "I scanned over 150 charts this weekend. Here are some good setups I found to BTD (or sell CSPs): SKLZ, PTON, FUBO, TDOC, AAL, MU", "selftext": "# Last Week's Review\n\nWe hit some home-runs last week with AMD, CLF, and TLRY. All of which were up over 20% at one point. The other names are not doing too bad either and IMO still \u201cconsolidating\u201d with their charts & technicals. Here\u2019s a snapshot of the ticker performance from the last two weeks. In the same time-period SPY has gone up 3%.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b0g8wtx6mte71.png?width=774&format=png&auto=webp&s=28e727f9ead432e46e22074c9489e03a8fbc44f0\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI exited my position on CLF as I felt it was beginning to get into the \u201cred zone\u201d I talk about. The ticker has been on an unbelievable uptrend since the start of the year and the chart is beautiful. However, I highlighted below a short-term risk area after the stock has shot up 30% in 7 days (due to good earnings as well). It\u2019s nearing the top of the trend channel and could potentially see a reversal. Either way, I protected my trade.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBefore we get into the tickers for this week here's a breakdown of some of my charting rules and terminology.\n\n# Chart Guidelines & Terms\n\nI use the term \"meme stock\" loosely as these aren't necessarily meme companies. I really mean that the ticker has a HIGH PROBABILITY to trend on social media and the stock price could be affected by social sentiment. The watchlist I give is usually comprised of tickers that have taken a breather after getting too hot from a social aspect.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMoving along, I like to look at my charts from a risk-reward perspective.\n\n\"Red Zones\" are high-risk lotto plays.\n\n\"Orange Zones\" are a bit of a mixed bag between being too hot or early in the trend.\n\n\"Green Zone\" is where I try to buy. These trades are never guaranteed (nothing in life is), but from a risk-to-reward point of view they are in my favor.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs always, this is not financial advice or a recommendation to buy or sell a stock. Please do your own research before entering any positions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# The Meme List\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Skillz Inc (SKLZ)**\n\nI categorize this play on the meme stock list because SKLZ has been known to trend on various social media outlets and gain momentum through retail traders. This is a lucrative play and considered a YOLO with earnings coming up on Tuesday after the close. Looking at the chart the stock price is back to 3-month lows and where it was trading last December.\n\nIt\u2019s current valuation at $14 is still pretty rich (5b market cap off 270m in sales), but should the stock continue to drop it might become quite favorable. This ticker traded at $45 back in February and is down 60% since.\n\nThere are many doubters in the viability of this company\u2019s business model, but for a high-risk, high-reward play I like it at this current price. Having said that, ARK ETFs currently hold about 20 million shares of SKLZ.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j7ns8wfcnte71.png?width=2558&format=png&auto=webp&s=98f2044dc2a34e2b8b1df98f8b2a8a22f5a98070\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Peloton (PTON)**\n\nPTON chart looks ready for another break-out to the upside. This could be a potential \u201cfear of lockdown\u201d play and any news of Covid variants will cause this to pop. Glancing at the fundamentals the company has quite a strong balance sheet with very little debt, and strong growth. Most analyst\u2019s concerns on this name are regarding if the growth is actually sustainable for the long-term.\n\nAt $118 per share the stock is nearing the bottom of the channel for it\u2019s most recent trend over the last 3 months.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xlljgnkdnte71.png?width=2558&format=png&auto=webp&s=377b626ef469edf1bef1f1e57f63bb872cb7ad39\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**FuboTV (FUBO)**\n\nLast, but not least on the meme\u2019s list we have FUBO. Remember the meme\u2019s list are tickers that have the potential to gain momentum through retail traders and popularity. This can sometimes be a driving force and the truth is you need to be in on these names BEFORE the hype-train leaves the station.\n\nFUBO had exceptionally strong performance back in December last year when it hit $60 per share. Concerns over the company\u2019s growth and sustainability have knocked the share price down by 60% and currently sits at $26. IMO we could be entering a green zone as the stock has traded sideways for a month now. FUBO reports earnings August 10.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hhhr705ente71.png?width=2554&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a63ee2d3908f955b45ee2ad8afdee4fc882da56\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# The BTFD List\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Teladoc (TDOC)**\n\nTDOC is one of the leaders in the \u201ctele-health\u201d industry. It gained momentum and popularity throughout lockdowns, but as the world-reopened the stock price has tumbled. In March, Amazon also announced their entry into the tele-health services and investors did not like this increase in competition.\n\nThis is a risky play and is potentially reliant on the lockdown catalyst, but at $148 per share and a 50% haircut from it\u2019s 52-week high, I will be looking to enter this position.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mu0ufnpfnte71.png?width=2556&format=png&auto=webp&s=19e074e533d51665dd9a9273c59bb3dcc5acb142\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**American Airlines (AAL)**\n\nAmerican airlines is a re-opening play. Travel is nearly back to pre-pandemic levels and most \u201cre-opening\u201d stocks are still trading at a discount due to future uncertainties.\n\nThe chart for most airlines will be quite similar to each other, and in my opinion the worst is behind us. I\u2019m looking for short-term upside on this one before the trend breaks down again.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/urudccegnte71.png?width=2554&format=png&auto=webp&s=94cac360b0279142c64e47042c42fdd996f85c07\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Micron Technology (MU)**\n\nOut of all the semi-conductor plays it always seems like MU gets no love. AMD and NVDA are performing very strong, but MU seems to be the laggard. MU is trading at a PE of 21 while NVDA and AMD trade at 92 and 37, respectively.\n\nMU just posted very solid earnings and the macro environment should be a strong driver of growth for semi-conductors in general. There has been a chip-shortage for some time now affecting many industries and all this pent up demand will last into 2022.\n\nI thought this stock was going to continue it\u2019s breakout at $95 a share, but it broke down starting in April and may have found a bottom at $77. I like MU here and might enter a position.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oegg5jwgnte71.png?width=2550&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb72bd73ec1eedbeebad5b81c17168db4c370d16\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Closing Thoughts\n\nThat\u2019s the end for this week. Remember, investing is about PAYtience because it pays to be patient. There are A LOT of uncertainties in this market right now which means it is not the time for crazy YOLOs. We have risks from inflation, covid, rates & QE tapering, re-opening risk (or lack of going back to \u201cnormal\u201d).\n\nThe VIX might not be close to the highs, but volatility is STILL HERE. We are seeing 2-5% daily swings in a lot of stocks right now. If anyone remembers before the pandemic you would be lucky to see a 2% move in most names.\n\nHope you all had a great weekend and I\u2019ll be back next week. Just FYI I might start adding a mid-week update some of the weeks to spot existing up-trends, down-trends, or tickers hyped on social media.", "id": "ow1qpf", "created_utc": 1627856532.0, "score": 417, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 74, "comments": [{"body": "Well time to short all of these", "score": 33, "replies": [{"body": "juggle hard-to-find seemly ruthless combative forgetful foolish worry wakeful retire\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)*", "score": 12, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.12729112803936005}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.16880835592746735}, {"body": "MU 90C like the good ole days", "score": 27, "replies": [{"body": "those calls killed everyone lmao", "score": 15, "replies": [{"body": "Truth", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1402401179075241}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.15962523221969604}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1523752510547638}, {"body": "TDOC, more like tele-don\u2019t imo.

They just couldn\u2019t manage it period. Even when we tried FaceTime and Skype they couldn\u2019t figure out anything like volume, camera angle, anything! We literally had to pick up the phone and switch to a straight up phone call most of the time. I realize that the target population for TDOC is probably much more tech savvy, and some of the challenges can be overcome with time, but I don\u2019t want more telemedicine. It is hard enough to take really good care of people when you\u2019re sitting in the same room with them, and often times you\u2019re figuring out problems through physical observation that the patient doesn\u2019t even know to ask about.

You know, the big plastic clunker thing that used to hang on your parents' wall before smart phones and video conferencing...that's how old these companies are. There is a role for these types of providers in the health care system but at anywhere near these levels of valuation they would need to capture a piece of the healthcare revenue pie that just isn't available to them. TDOC itself is nothing new in business model, as a company it has been kicking around for 20 years so it isn't some explosive new game changing idea...just an old idea with newer technology pumped by the lockdown. Can it be traded based on charts and sentiments, sure, but I would be careful of the longer term trend which ought to be down.\n\nAirlines I like, hopped into two this past week. I know AA is the meme one (as OP defines the term) and may be more tradeable because of that. I grabbed JBLU and LUV. Neither depends on heavily on business travel, both have good balance sheets (LUV is best of breed), both domestically focused (except for JBLU which has nearer term catalyst with London routes) so less exposed to international covid issues. Very good customer loyalty as well, those who fly them like them.
