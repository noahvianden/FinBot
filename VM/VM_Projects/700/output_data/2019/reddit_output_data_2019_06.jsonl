Nobody is question the size of the market for this - really the debate around market size is people debating between 'really big' and 'really fucking big'. \n\nThe real question is *much* more along the lines of 'how defensible is BYNDs intellectual property?' and 'can BYND fill the gap between demand and supply while fighting off competitors?'  BYND is a $10B company, and the *vast* majority of that valuation is based on BYND perfectly executing their growth strat for the next (say) 3-5 years.  They aren't priced for any serious fuckups and they are *definitely* not priced for the entry of competitors.   \n\nI don't cover equities, and I definitely don't get involved in hype-stocks, but I'll share what ppl on the street are talking about:  I had this convo last week - there are two other 'older' tech companies that both hit $10B (nosebleed) valuations and could be proxies for BYND - TIVO and GPRO.  Both of them were 'game changing hype-stocks' and everyone saw the obviousness of the story behind both TIVO and GPRO.  Go pull both of their charts - both of those stocks saw the exact same 'straight up and to the right' stock trajectories....before losing ~80% of their value over the next few years.  \n\nBut importantly, the 'market' for what TIVO/GPRO produce/manufacture has inarguably grown insanely - its just that neither of them were able to fight off competitors.  Nearly every hose that has cable has some sort of DVR, but not a TIVO.  Reddit/Youtube/social media is *full* of video shot with tiny/portable cameras, and video like this has changed the world - its just that relatively few of these videos are shot on actual GoPros; you can get a chinese knock-off for like 1/10th the cost that's 95% as good as the real deal.  \n\nOn the flip-side, you could look at TSLA as a first mover that's worked....so far.  The future is obviously emissionless cars globally, but the question is whether or not we will be driving electric Teslas or VW/GM/F/Nissans.  Or we could look at smartphones: AAPL & Samsung were successful in defending thier market; Palm, HTC, Motorola, RIM/Blackberry, Nokia, etc.....not so much.\n\nThe same is probably true for BYND - plant-based meat is likely to boom over the next few decades; I doubt that many really disagree with this.  And the price will certainly drop - maybe cheaper than the real thing? But the *real* question is how much of this can BYND capture - will plant-based meat become a commodity?
