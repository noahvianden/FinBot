I could buy 1 share, and if the stock goes up by 10% I've made $10.\n\nIf I want to increase my leverage though, I could buy a call option for $100 with a strike of $105 (it lets me buy 100 shares of the stock for 105). Now if the stock goes up to $110, I still have the right to buy it for $105, so I can ask my broker to exercise (buy those 100 shares) at 105, and then sell them at 110, and get $500, which minus my initial $100 cost for the call, means I end up with a 400% profit.\n\nThe problem here is, if the stock doesn't go above 105 by the time the call expires, it's worthless, and that $100 I spent disappears, while if I'd bought that 1 share, I might have something worth $104.\n\nOn the opposite side, you can buy a \"put\" which gives you the right to sell 100 shares at a given strike price, so if the stock goes below that mark, you can buy them at market price, and then sell them for more than they're worth\n\nNow that's a very simple explanation, and the value of the option contract itself changes with the price of the underlying stock, which is what people here on /r/wallstreetbets are counting on.

Generally at expiration, if your option is \"In the Money\"(for a call, if the strike is below the current stock price) then your broker will exercise it for you, and give you the profit. Because options have an extrinsic \"Time value\" (theta), it's often worth selling them before expiration.\n\nLooking at the current options prices.\n\nCCL is at 22.39\n\nA 21 strike call expiring 6/12 costs $1.73 (this is per share, in units of 100, so it really costs $173)\n\nSo if you were to buy that, then exercise it immediately, your cost would be $22.73 per share, which is higher than the current market price. You're paying a premium for the right to buy those shares, so you're hoping that the price rises above what it's currently at, if it stays the same, you'll be losing money.\n\nWhat most people here do, is buy that call, or a higher up one(anything above the current price is \"Out of the Money\" OTM, which means it will be worthless at expiration if the stock stays below it). Then they wait for the stock to go up, and then sell the option itself.\n\nI mentioned the greeks before.

I still dont understand the percentages though since some say 600% some say 23% but if the stock value goes up 1$ it's still 1$ x 100 shares = 100$? So I dont see how the percentages play into it.

The further ITM, the closer to 1 delta is, but the less the increase is proportionally.\n\nFar OTM options have a low delta, but the have a low value already, so any big move in the stock means huge proportional moves for them.\n\nWhile we're talking about delta, the other 2 really important greeks are Theta, and Vega.\n\nTheta is time decay, for every 24hours, the option price decreases by theta. And theta gets bigger the closer the option gets to expiration, look at theta when buying an option because you can see how much the stock has to move for delta to offset theta decay.\n\nVega is the measure of volatility value. You can see when looking at an option what the Implied Volitility(IV) is. IV is a measure of how much the stock could potentially move. So after huge jumps, such as today, IV is really high. You multiply vega by the change in value in IV to see how an option's price will change. IV gets high around events like earnings, where the stock could make a big move. Buying options right before earnings is dangerous because even if you guess the direction of the stock correctly, IV drops once the earnings are revealed, and the options loses value. So the change in stock price has to be large enough for delta to offset vega. It's known as IV crush.\n\nSo with CCL 22.5c 6/12 as an example again. IV is at 121% right now and vega is .01\n\nSo if IV were to drop to a normalish level (which for these times is probably something like 50%) that would be a 70% drop in IV, *.01 = $.7 lost on the value from IV crush alone.

{"title": "The liquidity trap: how QE and low rates might be inadvertently causing deflation", "selftext": "“Don’t fight the Fed.” That mantra is repeated as fact amongst almost every market participant across the globe (other than Davey Day Trader, who doesn’t know what a central bank is). Based off of that logic, one could reasonably assume that the Fed and Jerome Powell are the reasons for this recent market rally. All of WSB is bullish, and you can’t go more than four posts on WSB without seeing some exhausted money printer meme or a pro-Powell love fest. After a week of reading economic research papers nonstop, I think I have stumbled into something that the market and the Fed won’t see until it is too late to stop.\n\nFull disclosure: I am not an expert and this post should not be construed as anything other than my opinions and theories. This will be an extremely long and conceptual post (with a lot of references to research papers) that focuses more on economics than any financial analysis. It is not hard to understand, but be prepared to read.\n\n**Fed Reaction to Coronavirus**\n\nThe Fed’s reaction to coronavirus was extremely quick. After seeing what worked to stop the financial crisis in 2008, the Fed used the same playbook. Lower rates to near zero, buy treasuries (quantitative easing), buy mortgage backed securities, cut the reserve ratio to 0%. That playbook didn’t work though, the market kept selling off though. The Fed then did something unprecedented, they started buying corporate bond ETFs. They only bought high grade corporate bonds at first, but quickly realized that they had to buy junk bonds in order to keep the corporate bond market stabilized. Recently, the Fed [quietly announced](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-mainstreet/fed-eases-terms-of-main-street-loans-tells-banks-to-start-disbursing-idUSKBN23F2N8) a ramp up of their Main Street lending program, along with guaranteeing 95% of the loans instead of a range of 85-95%. This implies, to me, that banks don’t want to give out loans unless the Fed backstops them more. That will become important later in this post.\n\nThe Fed has also been buying commercial mortgage backed securities. These CMBSs are facing [extremely high levels of delinquency](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/cmbs-delinquencies-climb-in-may-with-hotels-and-retail-faring-worst-58714661). According to that article, 7.6% of all CMBS loans are delinquent as of May, along with 19.3% of hotel loans and 10% of retail loans. A [whistleblower report](https://www.propublica.org/article/whistleblower-wall-street-has-engaged-in-widespread-manipulation-of-mortgage-funds) indicates that the loans in these securities did not go through much scrutiny and could be massively overpriced as well. These assets are so toxic that the Fed [won’t even take that many of them](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/domestic-market-operations/monetary-policy-implementation/agency-commercial-mortgage-backed-securities/agency-commercial-mortgage-backed-securities-operations). In fact, the Fed has quietly [reduced their asset purchases](https://i.imgur.com/zlMFwbr.jpg) since the last week of March. This is just background information so I can explain what the Fed has been doing to the market so people can stop attributing the rally to Jerome Powell.\n\n**Reasons For the Rally**\n\nNow that I have explained what the Fed has been doing, I want to explain the reasons for this rally. This rally is driven by retail. How? Delta hedging. Some of you know about delta hedging, but for those who don’t I will explain a quick summary. A retail investors buys a call from a market maker. That market maker, being more risk averse than we are accustomed to, doesn’t like to sell naked options so the market maker will buy enough shares to become delta neutral. That means that as the call they sold goes up in price, they have shares that will cover most or all of their losses. Options are highly leveraged instruments, which is important because it gives retail the leverage that they need to get market makers to pump the market for them.\n\nThe important thing is that the analysts and value investors that are crediting the Fed for this rally don’t understand the options market as well as degenerates like us do. Retail has been [piling in](https://i.imgur.com/xuzFRSw.jpg) to the stock market at an astounding rate, especially into everyone’s favorite [broker](https://i.imgur.com/mNve5Mu.jpg). This data is as of the beginning of May and I suspect it’s a hell of a lot higher. \n\nBloomberg published some more up to date data recently regarding small option traders buying calls. Take a look at [the graph](https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ixvGtK3QI_Aw/v0/1400x-1.png) for yourself, it has gone parabolic. The [Bloomberg article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-09/speculative-fervor-in-u-s-stocks-surges-to-stunning-levels) states, “Traders established fresh bullish positions last week by buying 35.6 million new call options on equities, according to Sundial founder Jason Goepfert. That’s up from a peak of 28.7 million in February, when speculative activity was rampant, he wrote in a note Monday.” The volume from small options traders is estimated to be 50% in that same article, the highest since 2000. Google Trends for [“how to trade options”](https://i.imgur.com/6nf8LTw.png) and [“robinhood trade options”](https://i.imgur.com/4NJwVfh.png) have gone parabolic recently as well. The put/call ratio across all equities is also at [historic lows](https://c.stockcharts.com/c-sc/sc?s=%24CPCE&p=D&b=5&g=1&i=p77530317141), indicating a mass wave of euphoria and a lack of hedges. \n\nAfter seeing all of this, it is clear to me that this is a retail driven bubble and not driven by the Fed after April. Where is retail getting the money for this? The answer lies in the [savings rate](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PSAVERT). According to the Fed, the savings rate “is calculated as the ratio of personal saving to DPI. Personal saving is equal to personal income less personal outlays and personal taxes; it may generally be viewed as the portion of personal income that is used either to provide funds to capital markets or to invest in real assets such as residences.” As you can see in the graph, the savings rate is now significantly higher than it has ever been before, coming in at 33%. This means that consumers are not spending money, they are saving or investing it. Consumers are also paying down [credit card debt](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/TOTALSL) at much higher rates than anticipated. In the month of April, consumer credit had the [largest decrease since tracking began in 1968](https://eyeonhousing.org/2020/06/april-consumer-credit-indicates-recovery-challenges/). Remember the data in this paragraph, I’m going to refer to it later in regards to deflation.\n\n**Effects of Quantitative Easing**\n\nBefore talking more about the bubble, I am going to outline some data that shows the impact of QE on our economy since 2008 up until now.\n\nThe main effect of low interest rates along with quantitative easing is an increase in the money supply. You can see that increase [here](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2). Typically throughout history, an expansion in the money supply has lead to an increase in the inflation rate. That [has not happened](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FPCPITOTLZGUSA), the Fed has struggled to hit the target inflation rate since the crisis. With such an increase in the money supply, hyperinflation is stopped by the velocity at which the money moves. In 2006, Ben Bernanke noticed this phenomenon, [stating](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/10/business/worldbusiness/10iht-fed.3490493.html), “the empirical relationship between money growth and variables such as inflation and nominal output growth has continued to be unstable.” A recent [research paper](https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/ecolet/v182y2019icp23-25.html) has also found a significant positive correlation between wealth inequality and monetary growth.\n\nVelocity of money is defined by the Fed as: “the frequency at which one unit of currency is used to purchase domestically- produced goods and services within a given time period. In other words, it is the number of times one dollar is spent to buy goods and services per unit of time. If the velocity of money is increasing, then more transactions are occurring between individuals in an economy.” This velocity has been trending downward in a big way since 2008 (and before), not just in the US but everywhere. Velocity of the M2 money supply in the US broke through the previous low (tracking started in 1960) by 2012. Velocity is now [significantly lower](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2V). M2 velocity includes bank reserves though, so let’s take a look at the [velocity of M1](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1V) (which is physical currency and checking account deposits). [Demand deposits](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WDDNS) (checking account balances) have been exploding since 2008, with another massive jump starting in March. This means that cash is not being used and not adding to consumer prices or any economic productivity. I believe all of this to be an effect of QE and a prolonged period of low rates.\n\n**Liquidity Trap**\n\nThere has been a safe asset shortage since the advent of QE, as central banks of developed economies accumulate safe government bonds and US treasuries. This has lead to a shortage of safe assets, driving prices up and yields down artificially. Ricardo Caballero, an MIT economist, said [this](https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdf/10.1257/jep.31.3.29) (warning: PDF) in 2017: “The ongoing pressures driving the imbalance in safe asset markets has in recent decades helped to drive the steady decline in interest rates on safe assets. However, interest rates on these assets cannot fall much further. When the equilibrium full-employment interest rate needs to be negative, but cannot adjust sufficiently downward, then (other things equal) the equilibrating mechanism is an endogenous decline in safe asset demand through a reduction in aggregate income and wealth. That is, equilibrium is achieved through recession.” At the end of 2019, the Fed owned [36% of all US treasuries](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/funding-covid-19-debt-splurge-risks-the-independence-of-major-central-banks-58610836), with that number only set to increase after their open market operations this year. of April 21st, central banks around the world have bought [5 times](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/central-banks-buy-trillion-financial-assets-g7-march-federal-reserve-2020-4-1029113160) the value of treasuries as they did in 2008.\n\nThis shortage of safe assets has pushed yields down and made it so that banks have no desire to make loans to decrease their reserves. Take a look at the [excess reserves](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/EXCSRESNS) banks have been holding. Since the 2008 crisis, excess reserves have exploded. This means that the bank is sitting on cash that they are doing nothing with. The common belief is that lending goes up as rates go down, since banks have to make more loans in order to sustain the same amount of profit. However, the data does not show that to be the case since the introduction of QE. The key thing that I have noticed in regards to excess returns and loans is that banks do not want to make loans at these low yields, possibly due to the massive unpriced systemic risk of our debt bubble popping. In Q1 2020, banks tightened their loan standards at a rate [comparable to 2008](https://www.barrons.com/articles/banks-are-tightening-lending-standards-like-it-was-2008-again-51588881348).\n\nA liquidity trap is created when low interest rates are low and consumers and institutions decide to save money instead of investing in low yielding bonds. The Fed started paying banks a [small risk free interest rate](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IOER) in 2008, which moves along with the Fed funds rate. I theorize that the shortage of safe assets and low interest rates has gone past the “reversal rate” and accommodative monetary policy has become contractionary. In these uncertain times, banks would rather collect the small guaranteed risk free interest rate instead of introducing their balance sheets to any more risk, especially underpriced risk. The Fed believes that they are stimulating lending by cutting rates to 0. However, banks appear to not want to make non-guaranteed loans and instead are content to sit on their excess reserves. This means that the expansion of the monetary supply is not working as intended and that the money sitting in bank reserves is becoming contractionary. If loans aren’t being made and that money isn’t being spent, then that money may as well not exist in the money supply at all. According to a [Princeton economist](https://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/markus/files/25b_reversalrate.pdf) (PDF), quantitative easing raises this reversal interest rate and should only be done after rate cuts are exhausted. This means that the Fed could be unknowingly contracting the money supply, even though it appears that they are massively expanding it on paper.\n\n**Deflation**\n\nDeflation occurs when institutions and individuals don’t spend their money in the real economy, whether by purchasing goods/services or making loans to businesses. The Fed’s [deflation probability](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/STLPPMDEF), which is the possibility that personal consumption expenditures price index change will go below 0 in the next 12 months, spiked from .001 in January to .763 in May. The [probability](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/STLPPM) that we have inflation over 2.5% over the next 12 months has crashed down to .002 as of last month. As shown in the data above, consumers aren’t spending and banks are stockpiling their reserves. This is deflationary and will lead to lower prices, lower corporate earnings, and lower asset prices.\n\nAs mentioned in the data further up in the post, consumer credit dropped at a much quicker rate than expected, even with projections taking coronavirus into account. Economists expected consumer credit to fall by [$14 billion](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-consumer-credit-plummets-in-april-as-credit-card-use-tumbles-by-record-amount-2020-06-05) in April, but it fell by $68.8 billion instead. This was the largest one month drop in consumer borrowing since 1943. The core consumer price index (CPI) also [missed expectations](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/10/us-consumer-price-index-may-2020.html) of a 0-0.1% jump, instead falling by 0.1% for last month. This came after April was the largest drop (-0.4%) on record since data started in 1957.\n\nAccording to [research from the Netherlands central bank](https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/ecosys/v42y2018i1p45-63.html) (PDF), QE encourages risk taking by market participants and creates asset pricing bubbles. We are seeing bubbles across all asset classes thanks to the levels of debt in the economy (the stock market being an example). We even see debt bubbles too, like the $9 trillion of [corporate debt](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/21/theres-a-9-trillion-corporate-debt-bomb-bubbling-in-the-us-economy.html) (as of 2018) which help fuel these asset bubbles. The research from the Netherlands central bank also shows that asset bubbles popping are worth -4% inflation. An asset price bubble does not signal inflation either. I have picked out some quotes from the researcher that show QE might be leading to deflation:\n\n>Overall, the results suggest that the signaling value of asset prices for inflation is weak and unstable, implying that while QE is effective in boosting asset prices – one of the main transmission channels of QE − higher asset prices may not always lead to higher inflation. High asset prices may even precede a low inflation regime. For policymakers this is useful information because, based on the outcome of our models, one cannot presume that QE by definition leads to higher inflation.\n\n>If […] a surge in asset prices is not supported by real economic developments and therefore becomes unsustainable at some stage, the subsequent asset price collapse may cause a recession. \n>While central banks intend to raise inflation by purchasing government bonds to reduce bond yields, our results indicate that this policy can have the opposite effect on inflation.\n\n**Conclusion: The Fake V-Shaped Recovery**\n\nI conclude after doing this research, that there is no chance of a V-shaped recovery in the economy, despite what the market is signaling. I believe that we are about to enter into a massive deflation cycle that is being assisted inadvertently by the Fed’s policy of QE and the near 0% interest rates. Consumer credit is contracting and banks are stashing extra reserves, meaning that the real money supply is contracting. Default risk on commercial mortgage backed securities, corporate bonds (thanks to lower earnings), and other forms of debt will continue to rise as the economic effects of coronavirus and monetary policy undertaken by the Fed continue to be revealed. Defaults will rise even more if we get prolonged and sustained deflation as the weight of our debt crushes our financial system. I believe that, due to the historically high levels of retail activity in the market, it will crash soon as well. The wealth inequality effect of QE (which Powell denies the existence of) will make it increasingly harder for the economy to recover.\n\nAll of these things will feed off of each other as we get further into a deflationary cycle. It will be very difficult, if not impossible, for the Fed to get out of this crisis when we get into it. Deflation is rare historically and makes monetary policy ineffective, it is a central bank’s worst nightmare. Deflation will dry up economic activity and cause us to go into a depression which will be difficult to get out of.\n\n**tl;dr**: Powell thinks he is injecting money into the economy but it really isn’t going anywhere, the stock market is in a bubble that will pop very soon, corporate bond and CMBS default rates will increase over the coming year, deflation will make debt a heavier burden and cash more valuable, the Fed is powerless to stop it. Our economy enters a deflationary cycle that will be hard to get out of, until the bank reserves find their way into the real economy.\n\nI’ve spent a very long time researching this stuff but I am not an expert in economics or monetary policy, just another idiot on WSB.

I think what the above is getting at is that people need a certain % or safe income for a rainy day funds. What the write up above almost touches on, but doesn’t quite get into, is the banks lending practices to consumers vs institutions. As a disclosure that I probably shouldn’t make, I do have a career in the industry (I need to disclose to cover myself that this is all my opinion & observations and not based on non public information). Consumer debt has been getting riskier in the form of student loans and car loans, etc. While rates have been low, the inflationary cost of these “assets” has led to near oppressive levels of debt. My theory for a while has been that low interest rates have hurt part of the money supply, as referenced above, due to the need for people to have a certain % or ratio of free cash to obligations owed. As such, when rates are low a phenomena can occur where more funds are held in savings accounts and depository accounts in order to earn the same guaranteed interest as they would have when rates were higher though with less money (i.e. if rates were 5% you could earn $5 with $100; if rates are 1% you need $500 to do so, a $400 decrease in money supply).\n\nNow to the bank side. Part of what has hurt banks is non financial lenders. With the access to capital and seemingly rising economy over the past ~3-4 yrs, a lot of NFI’s and small banks even have been lending like crazy to undercut banks with essentially minimum ROI’s due to regulatory measures. (They’ve been acting like some of the RH investors here tbh lol). In a growing economy, this is easy money, but you lose hard in a recession as they are now. This has led banks to hoard cash, in conjunction with an oppressive panic over the next recession (gotta think about people’s careers. Most decision makers right now watched everything evaporate early in their careers with 08, they have a natural risk aversion). This too has led to a decrease in money supply. Banks won’t lend that while their assets (FYI, loans are the banks’ assets) keep degrading.\n\nIt is an interesting theory. Most of the money from the fed is ending up in the banks coffers and they don’t want to lend unless they are covered because the assets are toxic. These recent loans from Congress make no money for the admin costs but water down bank’s ratios.", "score": 73, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 47, "replies": [{"body": "I don’t know if there is necessarily anything to look at or whether I’m even qualified to say. I think you covered the theory very well above, but until time passes, we can’t really know whether it was fact or theory. \n\nThe only thing I’d add that’s only tangentially relevant to the theory is that there is truth towards people trying to park relatively “free” money of theirs in the market. I think one big thing people are overlooking rn while trying to meme and prove themselves right is the, for lack of a better term, capital structure of the markets right now (by markets I mean Dow, S&P, Russell, Nasdaq, etc). Also, in case people don’t know, the Russell index actually follows the true state of the economy much better and that has been showing more volatility than the others - part of it is because it contains the most companies. Anyways, the Dow and s&p prior to today and somewhat still are way overweighted with tech. That’s why it’s so dumb when everyone is talking about the s&p only moving 5% or like 8% on the week when you’ve got pretty much everything but tech & grocers down 30%+ on the week. I sold out today the moment I saw tech slip because I knew it’d enter a free fall. \n\nWhat I’m getting at is that there is something there that requires more due diligence. People are treating these like safe havens and pumping them up without actually trying to dump. I’m not sure what it indicates for the markets as a whole though. Not sure if it’s a good sign that there is still parked cash somewhere in the markets or a sign that the bottom truly is falling out for most industries and tech is just a Hail Mary play for now. Also, whatever the unemployment effect is, we won’t see for a while. Not sure if the markets will care as shockingly I do actually think most companies have adjusted and are profitable from scaling back. They’re just not doing the volume profits. Obviously doesn’t apply to every industry.\n\nLastly, and I’m kind of rambling, but people really really need to grasp that institutional funds are the ones moving the markets. If they want the troll RH investors out for messing up the metrics they need for millions of retirees, they’ll do it. Similarly they can pull out the rug quick too if they see something coming.

If you're willing to hold long term then this is pretty much as close to guaranteed as you can get.\n\nYou can also do something similar by writing cash backed puts like 2-4 weeks out at a lower strike that you're cool with buying spy at, then do the above if it gets exercised. If it gets exercised or expires worthless despite the market continuing to drop, then that would be more profitable than the above, but if the market bounces before your expiry and actually starts a recovery, then it would have a smaller profit overall.\n\nAgain, the insane volatility makes options go crazy expensive, which is great for responsible option writing on solid long term things like SPY if you know what you're doing.

Plus, any dope that bought calls to speculate will get wiped out because they probably panic sell, where the MM buys to close their short positions at minimum 50% profit. So all that stimulus money that congress gave everyone isn’t even being spent they way they intended, because as you have rightly pointed out, savings rates have been steadily increasing the last decade, and it all capitulated when this started just a few months ago.

If you want assignment to go long, then yes, buy a weekly ATM put and collect a fat premium.\n\nMost people selling puts are selling OTM and don't want assignment.

Most aren't held longer than a couple weeks. I sold a monthly on SPCE a week ago on a Thursday which I closed at my targeted profit the following Monday. Had that been a weekly I would have made less.\n\nIn most cases the monthlies you sell can be closed after a couple weeks, so you can sell 2 contracts in a month.

It also generates more trades which evens out your odds. If you flip a coin you have a 50/50 chance. If you flip it 5 times, you may get tails 4 times. If you flip that coin 1000 times, you'll get 50/50 results. \n\nThe same applies to trading. If you have 30 delta positions so 70% odds of success, sell monthlies which are easier to manage, close them early to reduce risk of the trade turning back against you, and trade more often, ladder your positions (spread out trades through a week rather than all at once to catch different market ranges), etc. - all of these things together increase your odds of success and making money long term.\n\nPlay the odds.", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I close monthlies within a couple of weeks.

This means that consumers are not spending money, they are saving or investing it. »\n\n\\-> Yes but it is because of the quarantine, this is not a bad sign rather good, as you say after « Consumers are also paying down [credit card debt](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/TOTALSL) at much higher rates than anticipated. » This is a very good sign for a V shape recovery, I can also add that the Chinese PMI went back to his previous values, so this mean that they have clients, so we should see a sharp decline in savings and spendings coming back to where they were.\n\n« The key thing that I have noticed in regards to excess returns and loans is that banks do not want to make loans at these low yields, possibly due to the massive unpriced systemic risk of our debt bubble popping »\n\n\\-> Well actually this issue is not entirely new, since the rise of negative interest rates, retail banks are struggling to make money on loan, and most of them are shifting their activities toward fintech and Corporate Banking, that is why as you said « recently, the Fed [quietly announced](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-mainstreet/fed-eases-terms-of-main-street-loans-tells-banks-to-start-disbursing-idUSKBN23F2N8) a ramp up of their Main Street lending program, along with guaranteeing 95% of the loans instead of a range of 85-95%.», because it is a way for banks to edge their risk aversion, but to be fair with you I agree that banks are no playing FED’s game and throwing money to the economy but as we have said, people are actually doing well (unemployment apart).\n\nLiquidity Trap\n\n\\-> I mostly agree with you, rates are not pumping investments anymore, but Keynes found a solution to fight the liquidity trap, he offers to increase the aggregate demand or effective demand (it is the total demand for final goods and services in an economy at a given time), that is why the FED is buying back all those corporate bonds, MBS… \n\n« The Fed’s [deflation probability](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/STLPPMDEF), which is the possibility that personal consumption expenditures price index change will go below 0 in the next 12 months, spiked from .001 in January to .763 in May. »\n\n\\-> This is way to soon to draw any conclusion.\n\n« We are seeing bubbles across all asset classes thanks to the levels of debt in the economy (the stock market being an example). We even see debt bubbles too, like the $9 trillion of [corporate debt](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/21/theres-a-9-trillion-corporate-debt-bomb-bubbling-in-the-us-economy.html) (as of 2018) which help fuel these asset bubbles. »\n\n\\-> Yep totally agree, I thought that the market was going to blow because of that, but it did not, so I consider the corporate debt bubble mostly as an inherent risk since 2016, I think that BlackRock is actually the most exposed to this risk but as they grow bigger I do not really see when it will blow in their hands.\n\nConclusion :\n\nAmazing DD again, I don’t agree with you concerning the rally… I think that your arguments mostly explain why this rally is very weak, but it doesn’t tell anything about the future of the economy. I think that we must wait to see a more stronger rally, it will be when major investors will come back to the market, but now assets are being held back due to the lack of clarity. \n\nIn my opinion, right now there is 3 key drivers to the market (in order of importance) right now : \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Sanitary : Are we going to find a vaccine ?

If zezro-interest loans to the banks didn't work, and pumping the populace with $1200 had a limited effect, what's going to happen next? Despite JPOW giving us a lot of doom and gloom on his press conference, he still mentioned that the Fed Reserve will continue to use their \"tools\" to keep the market afloat.\n\nEven if he **doesn't want to do it**, he might get pressured by Trump. Perhaps within a few days. At this point, keeping a booming market is one of the very few things going on for his presidency, and really what is keeping corporate elites pleased.

People still want to save money, but very, very slowly, people start buying, and perhaps banks start lending as well. This may take years to come back to last Monday's levels. Sucks ass for Trump, as he needs a win before elections.\n\n2- Trump hands checks to people: more money to the people? Most may end up just saving again. Most stores are closed anyway, so there's no easy liquidity here. At least it may keep people happy very temporarily. Hard to see this happening with the current negative press, but there may be enough room for him to be pushed this way. Jeff Bezos grows an extra boner.\n\n3- If the money's with the banks... would the Feds even think of giving them a negative interest rate? In the banks? They are holding all the money after all, and need to push it out as it gets de-valued. Makes contracts and loans more valuable for them to hold, and now it's kind of their problem. INSANE idea, as we're going complete ass-backwards as to how loans should work to begin with, but fuck it, everything goes. How the fuck would this even work?

So most of the money created from QE never made it into the actual economy, and just stayed within the banking system. The intention was to allow the banks to get free interest payments from the Fed to make up for their losses from bad real estate investments. Since that special Fed facility that allows banks to park money and collect interest at no risk still exists, I am sure something similar may repeat again - low inflation and low money velocity. However, all that needs to be done is remove that Fed facility, and the banks will be forced to make loans into the real economy again, and deflation chances would be eliminated.\n\nEnjoyed reading your well composed post with useful links, pretty good for an idiot on WSB.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "I am a massive rookie and I found this really interesting.

If anything, in normal times, this might mean that banks could increase profits due to more people wanting to take out loans.\n\nThe issue is that we are not in normal times.

The main effect of increasing the money supply is to decrease short term rates.

Would you try to repeat this again in the future?\n\nAnytime you are in a trade and you feel extremely anxious or nervous, that is not a trade you want or should be in. You will make rash decisions and fear takes over your decision making.\n\nWhy don't you instead gamble when the odds are on your side and with the capital you can afford to lose? Let me explain one of the mechanism to do so.\n\nLet's say you start with a 10k account.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Don't trade more than 5% - 10% on any position so 1k per position.  Max 20% (2k) if you have strong conviction and in those cases you can size in half a position 1k at a time. This allows you to average down in case the market brings down your stock due to whatever news.\n* Cut your losses when your options are down 10% to 30%, Market is telling you that your idea/execution was wrong so get out. This way you're not rationalizing with your self how the idea would work out.\n* Sell half when you're up 100%+ or whatever you're comfortable with and let the remaining run with an intention to close out the position if it drops below 50% gain is a good strategy.\n* Give your trade time to play out. The best money (5x, 10x or 20x)  is made over period of several days or weeks when the trend is on your side.  Lately market has moved more off hours than intraday.\n* Avoid options that expire in less than a week or two. Try 3 weeks to a few months out. You get less effected by time decay and if the position doesn't move in your direction, you can get out as well rather than waiting for it to expire worthless.\n* Add to winners if you see solid momentum and trend continuation but move your stop loss accordingly so you can get out in the green if it moves against you.\n\nHave a a set of rules (any rules not only this) that allows you to be mechanical instead of emotional.\n\nContinue to follow a rule based trading and you will see your portfolio will start to trend in the right direction, lets say after 10 trades in a month 5  are 100%+ winners while 5 are losing trades that you manage to get out at 20% loss on average. On a 10k account you will be up 4k in over a month with a 50% winning rate (i'm simplifying of course but let that sync in for a second). In a month your account value is up by 40%.\n\nNow you see a great opportunity and you are itching to YOLO trade because someone posted an insane DD and you agree as it does make sense or you disagree and say \"Fuck it, I'm in\" You can YOLO all of the 4K in that position or YOLO half 2k.\n\nThis is a much better situation to be in because\n\na) you YOLO'd only your profit or half of it. You can't blow up your account.\n\nb) you are not going to be emotional about this trade and make rash decision\n\nc) you can let the trade play out to be 10 bagger or 20 bagger\n\nThe key difference here is you've earned the right to YOLO after trading properly for a month. Imagine your TSLA trade today was only with your profit for the year. Would you have sold?\n\nStop watching so much gain porn and believing that you can do so as well easily as soon as tomorrow and quit your day job and live \"the life\". This is the shit that gets people to bet their entire account in a short term FDs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt takes time to perfect your craft so relax and figure out how you can develop a better trading system that suits your style.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Yolo trade only with your profits.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEnjoy your weekend.", "score": 54, "replies": [{"body": "Underrated comment right here.

Things move fast, emotions can run high, and you can easily make mistakes. I did today.

Sound familiar, it's not. But it was 70 years ago. This was the hay day of venture capitalists, political leveraging, and the advancement of social mathematical hard knox inflationary manipulation and control. What does all this mathematical commodity manipulation by hard assets backing? People that did what I did kept inflation under control, reduced public debt., increased consumer confidence, brought back war torn American from the brink, carried out Andrew Jackson's legacy too make mineral wealth the monitary entitlement of any working American Citizen, a right many people don't realize was less recognized than protection from slavery and indentured servitude, which was forced slave labor of indebted forfeiture of contract or tax evasion. Slavery would not have been the problem it was if it had been considered wrong in American Agricultural industries and industrial development. There were usually more white slaves than black slaves in Europe and the Americas, for the same reasons. People perceived to forfeit on terms of one kind of mutually acceptable contract and when terms were struck, witnesses bearing testimony, signatures placed on dotted line, and the point of no return--- firm, bareskinned, spit or blood shared between clasped hands too hands, or hands too wrist. Everything involving humanity was governed and regulated by the wealth of universally accepted hard assets. Even though everyone usedvcash and coin too quickly transfer wealth, no one trusted cash, accept the Chinese Culture that invented it. And only then, when the economy was so strong, that the steady flow of goods seemed virtually self sustaining. Where am I going with all this? Smart, ethical metal commodities speculators legitimized the Federal Reserve in America and backing and leveraging these assets irresponsibly made people worldwide confident in the infallibility of American paper currency. Too tighten this all up, speculators know how too control the markets they developed and protect and make an honest fortune doing so. Oh oh!! What's that? Honest fortune. As in oxymoron. Today's immoral financial system. Not back then. Anyway, endless story short. Honest speculation works when fair trade regulations are observed and ferderal antitrust legislation backed by harsh penalties for treasonous activities. Yes. In Rockefeller's day, monopoly sentiment was treasonous and I'm not aware of any changes too that legislation. Not all convictions of treason were punishable by death. Unfortunately, financial tycoons were the only indispensable people in this country, so hanging them made less sense than golden goose genocide campaigns. I'm running out of space, so hear it is.

People at church need too stop trash talking Satan, because no one worships him in this country, but he definitely worships all of us.

{"title": "Florida and Arizona have no other option but to shut down and nobody is paying attention.", "selftext": "**TLDR:** Some states have grown complacent and don't take social distancing and mask wearing seriously. From Memorial day onward, some of these places have started seeing exponential growth in cases which is guaranteed to overwhelm hospitals. Because the citizens don't think the virus is a serious threat, the only way to stop it will be statewide shutdowns. Governors won't acknowledge this because its politically inconvenient and will keep their states open as long as possible. That will make it much worse.\n\n**# Background**\n\nDuring the first wave of coronavirus, some states got decked, the citizens were scared shitless, and everything was shut down hard. The virus spread like wildfire throughout the North East, and everyone stayed home, socially distanced, and mostly wore masks. Because of this, the virus has faded dramatically in places like NY, NJ, and MA.\n\nOn the other hand, we have places like Florida and Arizona. They mostly shut down because of what was happening elsewhere. The citizens in these places interpreted the shutdown as unnecessary and job-killing. They're fatigued from the shutdown and nothing even really happened in their states.\n\n**# Catalyst**\n\nSo why does it matter? On June first, the 7-day moving average of case counts in Florida was 726. Right now the same 7-day moving average is over 2400. For some reason, April and May were boring. But starting in June, exponential growth started coming back. Perhaps Memorial Day served as a sort of kick-off event. Remember, this explosion in growth is a window into behavior 2-3 weeks ago.\n\nWhy can't they just continue life as usual and let the weak die? Because the entire population needs ICU beds. If there are no ICU beds available, they can't treat anyone with life threatening illnesses or injuries. Death rates will skyrocket for everyone, even those without COVID. Florida already has [less than 25% capacity left](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/icu-beds-short-supply-across-florida-state-struggles-coronavirus-spike-n1231451) and the new trend in case counts literally just started.\n\n\\# **Forecast and Timeline**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2urh0bdx4y551.png?width=610&format=png&auto=webp&s=afe806c67bd712f378150e313cd3455fad86339c\n\nThis is a forecast using exponential smoothing. I can provide all the code to run this forecast in the comments. The black line is the last month of cases. The purple is the forecast for the next 14 days. For context, New York, at its worst had roughly 10k cases a day. Italy only had around 6k/day at their peak. I'm too lazy to graph Arizona, but they're in the exact same situation.\n\nThis madness is going to be made worse by the fact that governors are choosing denial as their containment strategy. In both states, the governors are blaming increased testing as the reason for the spike. This hypothesis is easily disproved by the fact that hospitalization rates and % of positive test results are both increasing as well.\n\n**# The Play**\n\nRight now the market is pricing in a rosy recovery. I believe we will start seeing rolling statewide shutdowns this summer, starting with Florida and Arizona in the next month. This might bring the market back down to reality. So what is a realistic price for spy?\n\nThankfully a world-renowned valuation expert and NYU finance professor [just did a DCF valuation of SPY](https://aswathdamodaran.blogspot.com/2020/06/a-viral-market-update-ix-do-it-yourself.html) at the beginning of June. Further, he did it for a variety of input values via Monte-Carlo simulation to give us a range of fair values. Here is the output:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ot07whaz6y551.jpg?width=1498&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b124e4dff48623327933db6050a7bd8f625e1b6a\n\nThe market closed Friday around the 75th percentile of what could be fair value. To be conservative, we could assume once rolling shutdowns are priced in, it will drop to the 50th percentile. This gives us a great opportunity for a 310/300 or 310/290 put spread for July/August. If that's not autistic enough, buy naked UPRO puts. I bought most of my positions this week. If we are down big Monday, I'd wait for a mid-week rebound to buy into this play.\n\nEdit: someone called me out for assuming the exponential trend. That was bad science. To remedy this  I did model selection of nested  polynomial models via anova. The quadratic trend was statistically  significant, so I used that trend to extrapolate future case counts. Its not as bad, leading to around 7k cases/day in 14 days. The effect of  this lower case count could delay the day of reckoning for a couple weeks. They'll still be at 10k cases a day by mid july.\n\nUpdate on 6/28: Spy was 308 when I posted this (on 6/19), it bounced up to 312 a few days later, and then, shockingly, the 'rona hit the news cycle and we breached 300 on 6/26. There's much less of an opportunity now, but if sentiment shifts and we get some more bad news we may break 290. My puts are 320/310 spreads, so I'm holding tight and sitting pretty.", "id": "hcb7du", "created_utc": 1592608968.0, "score": 303, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 606, "comments": [{"body": "Florida governor said fuck em dood... on tv today.. im confused", "score": 201, "replies": [{"body": "Hey, it's Florida", "score": 48, "replies": []}, {"body": "Hehehe what arm thing homie", "score": 28, "replies": [{"body": "Fucking rip the purple army", "score": 19, "replies": [{"body": "All Scuffed Steve Jobs fault", "score": 12, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Exactly Florida gov def doesn’t seem concerned but media does what am I missing", "score": 17, "replies": [{"body": "The governor is looking at hospitalizations, which are flat and the news is looking at cases.

Florida hospitals were at 87.5% capacity average before the virus.  They kicked out anyone who didn't absolutely need to be there when the virus hit and then realized they had completely empty hospitals and not many virus cases.  Per Desantis the reason for most of the uptick in hospitals is because of the groups of non-covid patients that they have allowed back in.\n* Median Age:  Median age of positive tests in many FL counties was in the 29-32 range.  This means half of positive tests were from  people who most likely showed no symptoms and were just caught in mass testing (tested everyone in the office). These people would not have been tested 3 months ago, so most likely we had many more cases than preciously reported.  There weren't overcrowded hospitals then, also could mean is less deadly than thought.\n* Remdesivir: While this inst the cure and and may not even be that useful, it is something.  3 months ago hospitals had nothing and were completely unprepared.  Even if it helps only 5-10% of severe cases, that can make a difference.  Combined with the extra hospital beds, which the article posted admits weren't accounted for, the hospitals are not that close to overcrowding.\n\nOnce again, Florida may still have to close, but I would bet it would be a temporary close, like maybe close July 15 and then reopen Aug 15.
