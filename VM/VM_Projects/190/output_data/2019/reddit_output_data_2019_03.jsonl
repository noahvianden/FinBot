People act like this is a one year project. It was a 15+ years project. The tax incentives are contingent on whether Amazon fulfills their end of the bargain.\n\nThe city isn't creating tech jobs like these. NYC is primarily a financial sector market. Adding these tech jobs in a location that desperately needs some commercial activity would have been perfect. Sets a great example and precedent for other tech companies to start migrating towards NYC if there are more talent available.\n\nRents are going to keep going up. Amazon wouldn't have prevented that. This area has been increasing at a high rate because of its proximity to Manhattan. Though I do see a concern here, this happens in any developing market. It's simply a trade-off that provides a long-term benefit.\n\nYou're missing the part where additional commercial activity would increase. As I've said, I live minutes away from the proposed location. This area was primarily for factories and warehouses which have been abandoned. It was recently designated as an opportunity zone. Amazon's arrival, if they plan on taking advantage of the tax incentive, would have employed 25,000+ individuals. These individuals would need to eat, drive, live, purchase furniture, toiletries, groceries, gym, laundry, etc., That increases the amount of jobs available outside of Amazon. \n\nThe tax incentives are structured in a way almost as an annuity. There is no lump-sum payment, no money available to NYers right now, and Amazon aren't getting anything in return if they aren't providing results. The idea that there are too many negatives for Amazon's arrival that it wouldn't make sense is simply a poor argument. Are you implying that high paying jobs shouldn't exist because it would drive up rent prices? What if there wasn't any tax incentive? How would that prevent rent prices if Amazon still chose to have their HQ2 here? Did you know that New Jersey and Maryland also proposed a $7 billion tax incentive to Amazon? The taxes provided simply dwarfs the negatives - which so far, has primarily been the rent prices increasing.

The tax incentives aren't actually contingent upon anything really. While you're right that the 3 billion isn't a lump sum, 500 million of it is, and the remainder is a tax credit of $100,000 per employee regardless of what those employees are paid, or how many are hired. That's pretty insane. That said, I never even mentioned them in my original comment, so I don't really see what you're arguing with there. \n\n2. Yes and no. While NYC doesn't have as many tech jobs as silicon valley, there are still quite a few. Google's office here in Chelsea already employs 7,000 and the new one opening in the village will employ even more than the existing one. And California and Washington are the only states in with more tech job growth than here. There are almost 8,000 tech firms in the city alone and it's the fastest growing sector in the city, regardless of whether Amazon is here or not. \n\n3. Rents will continue to increase, yes. However, any big employer like that will give landlords an excuse to pump up rents more than they might have otherwise. As a landlord, I've done it myself. The location in particular poses an issue because it's not Manhattan. If they were opening HQ2 in Tribeca or FiDi, then nobody would have had a problem where rents are concerned since it wouldn't have had the same sort of affect. \n\n4. Commercial activity would not really have been all that affected because there's already plenty of stuff to do in LIC, and most of the workers would be commuting from outside the area, or already live in the area. Southern Connecticut, Long Island, Manhattan, other parts of Queens and Brooklyn. Sure some new commercial activity would happen, but it would be minimal. \n\n5. Yeah, they offered more, but they have to. This is New York, not Baltimore. It's objectively better in basically every way. Amazon greatly exaggerated both jobs and tax numbers. Amazon themselves would be unlikely to pay any taxes even without the incentives, as they have been doing and a good portion of the workers at the facility would likely be receiving services, not contributing to them.

I'm certain that small companies regularly cross boundaries because they barely have a compliance department. IR workers at large caps mess up and say things they shouldn't to people they shouldn't because people make mistakes.\n\nIt happens. It's like jaywalking. Jaywalking is illegal, but unless you really go out of your way to be annoying to a police officer, you aren't going to get in trouble for it. \n\nThe problem here is that Tesla is already under the SEC microscope. Musk has already gone on the biggest news program to basically say \"F the ~~police~~ SEC.\" He's already settled with the SEC for stock manipulation, and he's under their watch now.\n\nMatt Levine at [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-02-20/elon-musk-can-t-help-himself) summed it up really well:\n\n>What on earth would you do here if you were the SEC, though? The SEC has a settlement with Tesla, approved by a federal judge, requiring the company to “implement mandatory procedures and controls to oversee all of Elon Musk’s communications regarding the Company made in any format … and to pre-approve any such written communications that contain, or reasonably could contain, information material to the Company or its shareholders.” \n\n>Tesla has made it absolutely clear that it never intends to comply with that settlement, that it will continue to allow Musk to make material public statements without any sort of controls whatsoever, and that no lawyer can ever tame him. **Don’t get me wrong, this is funny, and I enjoy it, but it is also a genuine problem for the SEC. It is hard to enforce securities laws against everyone else if you’re openly letting a high-profile CEO ignore them.**\n\nEmphasis mine.\n\nThe SEC doesn't want to ruin Musk. Everyone forgets that they could have done that when he backtracked on the first settlement offer they gave him. They didn't. They just upped the settlement amount, which, for a billionaire CEO who could have been barred from being an exec at any public company if the case went to court, is a relatively small difference. This may be controversial, but the SEC was actually pretty nice to Musk, all things considered.\n\nBut the SEC does want to be taken seriously, and to do that, it means aggressively enforcing the laws against the most high-profile lawbreakers.\n\nWas it a Reg FD violation?

As with politics, there is a tendency to dismiss the bad behavior of one's own side, while playing up the faults of the opposition.  \n\nIn the past, I have read and participated in TSLA discussions on Twitter, Tesla Motors Club, and other forums.  Twitter *is* brutal.  A good number of super-Bulls on Twitter have storehouses of Bear predictions from years past, and do not hesitate to tweet taunts with screen shots of past Bear predictions that turned out to be entirely incorrect.  However, the Bears are not entirely blameless here.  Twitter Bear personalities like Mark Spiegel, \"Tesla Charts\", and Skabooska (I don't think that's the exact handle -- it was someone who claimed to be using a drone to spy on the Fremont factory) have made plenty of incendiary posts, including a good number that turned out to be false or maliciously misleading. \n\nTesla Motors Club was also a regular target of Bear accounts.  I stopped posting there after it became apparent that the owners of the site were either overwhelmed by the volume of traffic, or simply no longer gave a shit about the rampant trolling.  Some people who were openly Bearish in the investors sub there, would go into the owners' subs and actively spread lies and misinformation about Tesla products to prospective buyers, presumably to discourage demand.  Many would openly lie, and post information in direct contradiction to published quarterly delivery and financial results.  I saw it all: everything from subtle concern trolling to blatantly profane insults from Bear accounts.  \n\nAt first, I believed that this was a matter of financial interest, but it's become much more than that.\n\nThe TSLA debate is no longer IMO about money.  It is about ego, and people fearing total humiliation in public.  The uncertainty around Tesla feeds this.  The company has survived a global financial meltdown that should have killed it, and survived many botched product launches, yet its continued rise is far from assured.  People who have made solid and fervent declarations on what they \"know\" will happen (when they actually cannot possibly know the outcome), have a lot of credibility on the line.  In the end, reputations will be ruined and credibility destroyed, but we don't know who will suffer this fate.  People are *scared*.

They! Are! Not! Elon Musk literally said on television that he was not going to have a lawyer pre-approve his tweets! He further clarified that the reason he was not going to do this, even though it was arguably required by the terms of his settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, was that “I do not respect the SEC. I do not respect them.” The fact that he then tweeted without getting his tweets pre-approved is the least surprising event in the history of the capital markets, and I guarantee you that the SEC is not surprised. They don’t even really say that they’re stunned. They say that it’s “stunning.” Very different. It’s stunning, sure, but no one, at this point, is stunned.\n\n>Anyway here is the SEC’s latest filing in its effort to get Musk held in contempt of court for tweeting stuff about Tesla without pre-approval. We talked about that effort here, and about Musk’s response here. Musk’s view is that he only has to run tweets by a lawyer if he thinks they might be material, and so now he tries to only tweet non-material things about Tesla. The SEC disagrees: \n\n>>The Court-ordered pre-approval requirement for Musk’s written communications lies at the heart of the settlement. Musk’s unchecked and misleading tweets about Tesla are what precipitated the SEC’s charges, and the pre-approval requirement was designed to protect against reckless conduct by Musk going forward. It is therefore stunning to learn that, at the time of filing of the instant motion, Musk had not sought pre-approval for a single one of the numerous tweets about Tesla he published in the months since the Court-ordered pre-approval policy went into effect. Many of these tweets were about the topics specifically identified by Tesla in its own policies as potentially material to shareholders. Musk reads this Court’s order as not requiring pre-approval unless Musk himself unilaterally decides his planned tweets are material. His interpretation is inconsistent with the plain terms of this Court’s order and renders its pre-approval requirement meaningless. \n\n>Ehh. Look, I see Musk’s lawyers’ point: The settlement doesn’t literally require him to pre-clear all of his tweets, but only to pre-clear the tweets that might be material, which gives him some wiggle room. I see the SEC’s point: Musk has uniquely terrible judgment about what he should tweet about his company, which is why we are here in the first place. One path forward would be to change the settlement slightly to make this determination simpler, for instance by requiring Musk to pre-clear all tweets about Tesla, whether or not he thinks they are material. Obviously Musk would object to that. When we last talked about this, I suggested an opposite approach of just letting him tweet whatever he wants and declaring it automatically immaterial. Obviously the SEC would object to that. It feels a little like Musk and the SEC don’t have a settlement at all: They reached an uneasy (and short-lived) truce by signing a piece of paper, but they don’t agree on what the piece of paper means.\n\nYou can subscribe to his newsletter [here.](http://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/join/4wm/moneystuff-signup&hash=54223001ca3ffcf40f2629c25acea67a)\n\nI highly recommend it, he's never written an article that wasn't at least worth glancing at.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "This is such a stupid case.

Judges have extremely wide latitude to enforce consent decrees that are being violated.\n\nIn practice I expect a fine and for the judge to amend the original consent decree to explicitly require pre-approval of all tweets related to Tesla. Almost certain of the former, about 50/50 on the latter. There are potentially other possible remedies to bring Musk in line with what the settlement was intended to make happen, but I can't think of any.\n\n>What if he isn't? Do things just go back as they were...\n\nIf Musk is found to have acted within the bounds set by the consent decree then nothing changes for Tesla. They may be awarded legal costs, but I doubt it; there is very close to a zero percent chance of Tesla being awarded damages. They can continue behaving as they were prior to the SEC asking the court to find Musk in contempt.\n\nThis would, I think, be the worst of all possible outcomes, because it would lead Musk to believe that he is legally invincible (with some evidence to support that theory, to be honest).

If you look over the last year and a half, it's been as high as 340-50 (ignoring the going private tweet fiasco) for basically doing its job and letting people know that it's doing it's job. In particular, the semi-truck unveiling showed a vehicle that wouldn't be in production for a while, without clear margin indicators to say it'll be highly profitable, in a market segment that has a fairly slow turnover and a fear of unproven trucks. The stock was up then solely because people were excited.\n\nThe roadster v2 added a bit to that, as luxury was historically where they made their money, but how much income could a limited run vehicle really bring in? It was the tech, not the vehicle, that was interesting.\n\nNone of those tech promises have disappeared, and buying out a battery company also gives hints, but the \"big progress\" was intended to be m3 scaling and deliveries.

Never in the history of capitalism had the response to high demand been lowering prices.\n\nUS deliveries were 6500 and 5700 the last two months for Model 3.  That's the current demand after pulling all the cars forward into December.  That's the new reality (not counting the SR). This is confirmed by the fact that there was no backlog of orders heading in to March. So ~1500/week is steady state demand. \n\nSo ask yourself, critically, how many people are getting in at $35k-38k that weren't getting in at $40k for the MR? Some, for sure.

The numbers you quote seem to come from InsideEVs, where if you look at other non-Tesla cars the site is tracking, the Honda Clarity sold 18,000 last year but only averaged \\~1200 for the first two months of this year for an annualized rate of 14,400.  The Bolt also sold 18,000 last year but only averaged 1075 in the first two months of this year.  Their tax credit didn't expire so this is 100% cyclical.\n\nIf you look at Tesla, the S and the X last year sold 1500 and 2100 in the first two months, but a total of \\~51800 throughout the year, which is over double the rate suggested by their first two months (2.3x actually).  They started this year roughly where they started last year, with 1825 and 1900 respectively so those cars at least suffered only barely from the tax-credit pull-forward.\n\nI think it's completely reasonable to think some of the drop-off on the Model 3 from Dec 2018 to Jan 2019 is pulled-forward demand, but I don't think it's reasonable to assume Jan/Feb sales are a solid predictor of the year for any car company.\n\nIf we took the S/X multiplied of 2.3x the Jan/Feb rate, that would suggest 170,000 Model 3s this year.  The price drops will increase that number but the tax credit expiration will decrease it - I'm not sure where that leaves us but 170,000 seems like a decent guess for US sales.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSecondly, you mention that you're only talking about US, but then never go on to add in an estimate for the rest of the world.  It would be pretty reasonable to assume the rest of the world will buy roughly as many 3s as the US does.
