At the time, the company expected the cuts would total about 10,000 people, but a person with knowledge of the issue said the number could change, The Wall Street Journal reported. Thousands of those cuts began last year.\n\nThe rest of the cuts will bring the total number of layoffs to more than 17,000 and will be made over the coming weeks, some of the people said. As of September, Amazon employed 1.5 million people, with a large percentage of them in its warehouses. The layoffs are concentrated in the company’s corporate ranks, some of the people said.\n\nAmazon was one of the biggest beneficiaries of the Covid-19 pandemic as customers flocked to online shopping. The rush to Amazon’s various businesses, from e-commerce to grocery and cloud-computing, pushed forward years of growth for the company. To keep up with demand, Amazon doubled its logistics network and added hundreds of thousands of employees.\n\nWhen demand started to wane with customers moving back to shopping in stores, Amazon initiated a broad cost-cutting review to pare back on units that were unprofitable, the Journal reported. In the spring and summer, the company made targeted cuts to bring down costs, shutting physical stores and business units such as Amazon Care.

They're not moving from 2 years of data to 1 year of data... they're changing the **WEIGHTING** of the data categories from 2 years to 1 year of data.\n\nYoY CPI always uses 1 year of data.  That was true last year. It's true this year.\n\nFrom the BLS site:\n\n>Starting with January 2023 data, the BLS plans to update weights annually for the Consumer Price Index based on a single calendar year of data, using consumer expenditure data from 2021. This reflects a change from prior practice of updating weights biennially using two years of expenditure data.\n\n[https://www.bls.gov/cpi/notices/2022/methodology-changes-2022.htm](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/notices/2022/methodology-changes-2022.htm)\n\nWhat they're changing is how the impact of a sector is calculated, I.e. the weight. If, say (this is a fictitious example to demonstrate the point), used cars are a major part of economic activity in 2021, but in 2022 they reduced as a segment of the economy, keeping an elevated weight is wrong.\n\nWhat's changed in the post-pandemic economy is that consumer purchasing cycles have compressed because of the post-pandemic demand whipsaw cycle. It used to be that consumer cycles went along 2-3 year rotations, more or less. Now they're compressed because people are filling demand quickly and moving to another sector.\n\nWhat changing to 1 year of weighting data does is align the 1 year CPI number more to the 1 year consumer cycle.\n\nGoing back to used cars, with the older system excess demand in 2021 influenced how the 2022 YoY calculations were weighted in that number... but if consumers  were buying fewer used cars in 2022 the effect of the price difference on consumer wallets mattered less than it did the previous year.\n\nIf consumer demand cycles didn't change, the number of the weight doesn't change. If there is a change, the impact is agnostic.\n\nIf you have a category that was in high demand in 2021 but lower demand in 2022, and that price collapsed, the impact of the older method would be to weight that higher than other categories which had more consumer cycle impact. In other words, the old method could be hiding inflationary impact, just as much as it could be hiding deflationary impact. So the claims that this would somehow make inflation seem better than they were are bullshit based on a fundamental lack of understanding regarding how data works.\n\nEdit to add: Even with the new methodology, there's a lag in the consumer data, because it takes time to report that data... so we could still quibble about how much CPI reflects consumer trends, but this reduces the distance of that lag in the data, which makes it more accurate.\n\nTo further explain, because this is complex, the YoY inflation number is a comparison. So numbers from this month are basically comparing numbers from the beginning of 2022. Consumer patterns from 2021 have a lag to the latest data, but are the closest to the comp from a year ago. The old system could comp trends from 2020 to late 2021/early 2022... which would be bad.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhile we're on the topic of people spreading bullshit they don't understand, a number of people have repeated the empty-headed claim that some sites out there calculate \"CPI like they did in the 1980s\" referring to Shadowstats' faked data.\n\nNO ONE calculates inflation like they did in the 1980s because no one collects the basket data they used anymore. It's literally impossible to do. What those sites do is take an index the BLS maintains which shows a projected difference in CPI calculation over 20 years and then apply it today. This is invalid, first of all... second, the sites that do this all cite Shadowstats or other sites that use a similar methodology and what his methodology does is incorrectly compound the BLS' index 20 year divergence over the past 20 years, which amplifies the impact by many magnitudes in what can only be described as an elementary-school level failure to understand basic math.\n\nThe guy who does this no longer even works as an economist... he just makes money selling consulting and speaking fees based on this fake data. The \"1980s\" inflation data people are citing is a con job driven by someone inventing a consulting space for themselves on bad data, not actual 1980s inflation data, which is impossible to calculate in the same way because the source data just doesn't exist.\n\nPeople need to stop just believing what they read in random tweets and do some research before they accept things that feel right as facts.

Your last sentence shows your investment is more emotional than purely data based which is fine, but explains why your valuation is so wildly different from mine.\n\nAn important thing to consider about FSD and any automotive tech they develop first. They can keep that tech proprietary to Tesla to improve sales, at which point they do not deserve valuation as a tech company. Or they can sell FSD too all manufacturers, justifying argument they are tech company, but undercutting their automotive business by removing what makes them special. Tesla cant have it both ways. If they keep FSD proprietary (which would be foolish), others are not too far behind and that would only help them for a couple years. Thus I argue they should be valued as an automotive company until they can become a viable tech company. Right now their only marketable products are automobiles so arguing they are a tech company has always seemed kinda silly to me. Generally speaking Tech companies have some sort of viable product when they go public and get huge valuation when their tech achieves broad adoption and scale. Tesla was operating as a car company, then people began treating them like a tech company when they announced their tech idea, without proving viability in any meaningful way.\n\nIn fact, I read today a former Tesla engineer just stated under oath in court that they faked their 2016 self driving video, which has gotten me convinced FSD was always a pump and dump scheme.

Biden and allies vs putin. They have interdependent decisions to make. But ah well, forgot this is wsb and everyone is a regard, ie I should have spelled it out.

The war is nearly over\n2. It’ll cause oil to dump hard\n3. World will enter deflation since we have supply surpluses and abundant energy and oil.\n4. Fed will pivot\n5. QE will begin\n6. Ukraine will be the next money pit\n7. Biden will be re-elected \n\nMain is number 1. Putin only has 2 options now, nuke or negotiate. US and nato allies know this, so they’ll push until they know they can’t anymore anymore and pivot to negotiations. Biden will “broker” the negotiation. It’ll cause Russia to start selling oil again. Saudi’s will be scared that US and Russia are on talking terms again and begin to let the oil flow. (Not sure if Biden will hold a grudge against Saudi Arabia, they may).\n\nOil and gas will drop insanely. That coupled with surplus supply and unemployment happening, fed will have to pivot.\n\nDepending on how mad unemployment actually is, fed may have to cut interest rates and may have pause QT.\n\nI expect stock market to fly, but if for some reason it doesn’t, QE will happen.\n\nBiden will use ending the war and reversing inflation. They’ll also blame inflation of trump.\n\nBiden will get re-elected.\n\nMainly, the conflict only has 2 ways to go now, Putin pushes the button or Putin stops the war. Since this is a 0 sum game, the war will end.\n\nCaveat, if putin is actually sick and doesn’t give a f about anything, buy a bunker! 🤣", "id": "10pjbhi", "created_utc": 1675125702.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.48, "num_comments": 187, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|10|**First Seen In WSB**|2 years ago\n**Total Comments**|1835|**Previous Best DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/sxeqdj/game_theory_metafacebook/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/syv0mn/russian_conflict_stocks_ev_tesla_solar/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/t55wc7/boil_uso_much_more_room_left/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/s8ilg4/corz_ipo_today_core_scientific_youre_welcome/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/t4ju4p/ev_tesla_community_talk_tuesday/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xazi6s/caap_slowest_upward_trend_ive_seen_but_making/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/x40xrp/caap_deep_value_play/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/t3hc0k/tsla_multi_trillion_dollar_company/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/t8saqb/xop_oil_gas_etf/) \n**Account Age**|6 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\n ^^[**Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse) ^^[BanBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/banbets/)  ^^VoteBot ^^[FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/votebot/) ^^[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/leaderboard/) ^^- ^^[**Keep_VM_Alive**](https://www.patreon.com/visualmod)\n>TL;DR: War is nearly over.
