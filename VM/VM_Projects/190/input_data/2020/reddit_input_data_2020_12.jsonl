This has been happening over the last two decades and Tesla's relatively high diversity numbers compared to other automakers can be primarily accounted for in their comparatively young workforce.*\n\nI was inspired to write this because of the emotional response I had in reading your post, especially this. \n\n>A person from a low socioeconomic background has almost no chance of competing with me no matter how hard they work.\n\nAssuming you are an established professional in your career, and have been for a decade, there is real truth to this... someone who grew up in a low socioeconomic position  at the same time you did absolutely did not have the same opportunities that you had, and to this day is at a significant disadvantage to you professionally.\n\nHowever, it has been long recognized that the right solution to this has never been for companies to deviate from hiring the best of the best, the problem has to be solved where it is created... childhood and the educational system:\n\n**Improve home environments for all children, providing social support for the child specifically.** This is something that still needs a lot of work, but can be seen in free breakfast, lunch and dinner at the school, and in keeping school campus buildings open from early AM until late PM for all students, not just athletes and extracurricular participants, so that students have somewhere to do homework & socialize away from difficult home situations. Future programs that provide direct benefits grants to children and not their parents in cases where it is clear their parents are not spending the benefit for their wellbeing will do even more, as will providing educational and counseling to parents in these situations.  The ubiquity of technology is also leveling the playing field... the trend towards raising children with screens means that these children are being exposed to the same content and will be growing up with equal technological literacy. I won't get into the potential downsides here, that is another discussion entirely. \n\n**Attack racism wherever it exists in the educational system**  This includes student and teacher behavior, but larger impacts have been made at the school board, county, and state educational system level, where funding and school boundary decisions have been made.\n\n**Ensure that all schools are equally funded and equipped (with good teachers as well as good technology)** The amazing advances in technology over the last decade are starting to finally democratize access to good teaching, but there is still a lot of work to do with regards to student counseling and educational assistance. Technology is helping here too. \n\n**Encourage, recognize, support and reward any student's exceptional ability and performance, regardless of socioeconomic background.**  This is probably the area where the most progress has been made, as there are numerous nationwide programs and countless local programs providing incredible opportunities for middle school and high school students, especially students in districts that serve low socioeconomic communities and are otherwise financially disadvantaged. I can only point to the example of the university I attended. It was in a major US city, closely located with very some of the most socioeconomically challenged areas in our state. Large groups of students from the local high schools were often on our campus using lecture halls for events. Campus professional society organizations did frequent outreach on high school campuses. Even more importantly, our school ran a large free tutoring facility on campus that was equally open to both college and high school students. Finally, the part I was most involved in, was extreme support by the university of any local teacher led initiative for interscholastic competition beyond athletics... these high schools punched so far above their weight class when it came to Robotics, Math, Coding, debate, dozens of other events...  complaints were filed by much more advantaged schools pointing at unfair collaboration with world-class professors and facilities. Evidence of the success of these programs was that in my senior year there, the local high schools had a higher college acceptance rate among their graduating seniors than the high school I had attended, in a much more \"socioeconomically privileged\" part of the country.\n\n**Ensure that financial capability is never a limiting factor for continuing education.**  This needs almost no explanation. Scholarships and Grants for exceptional educational performance, with special focus on students from low socioeconomic backgrounds, have multiplied over the last 20 years, and at the same time the process of applying for and receiving federal financial aid has been streamlined and simplified to the point that a high school student can complete the application on their phone without any input from their parents at all, completely removing the need for professional or parental assistance that provided an advantage to more privileged applicants. While government backed student loans are a hotly debated topic, the complete blindness to economic background with which they are distributed has also helped remove the financial barriers to education.\n\n**Conclusion; How these efforts are changing the workforce.** All of these things have been aggressively pursued in the US educational system since the early 2000s, and efforts have only accelerated over that time. I think that Tesla's relatively high diversity numbers compared to other automakers can be primarily accounted for in their comparatively young workforce.. A teenager in 2005 had incredible opportunities regardless of socioeconomic compared to a teenager in 1995 or 1985, and these are the people who have been entering Tesla's workforce over the last decade, and are now just starting to make their way into management. Teenagers in 2010 had even more opportunity, and had the benefits of better younger educational systems. Teenagers today are in an even better place. In the next decade society is going to see the results of these programs as a much more diverse pool of highly qualified individuals advances through the workforce.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for sharing your insights. \n\nI sit on a grant panel that distributes translational funding for public private partnerships.  We get many proposals trying to address inefficiency in education. It seems to me that there are still many opportunities to improve (even disrupt) education. \n\nI think the keys are scalability and personalization. \n\nThe education system is not scalable, it does not get appreciably better as it gets bigger. This is a holdover from a time before networked global communication. Many people are trying to scale education with VR, remote learning, and AI.  \n\nPersonalization is also a major obstacle to efficient education. The education system is designed by people who think a certain way so that people who think in similar ways do well. It is clear from neurobiology that everyone has the capacity to learn the most complex material but the way that things are taught means that 90% of students are underserved by the existing teaching framework.  The application of psychometric profiling to the problem of teaching promises to aid in the design of custom curriculums that appeal to the personal learning styles of individual students. \n\nA scalable, personalized system that works could unlock the potential of billions of undereducated people at very low cost.

Personally I struggled through elementary and middle school with the teaching methods (memorization of facts, listening to my classmates read the textbook out loud, repetitive practice of processes) clashing with my learning style (silent reading, discussion/debate/questions, hands on experimentation). It wasn't until my last two years of high school where school began to click, and I was lucky that the collegiate system somewhat matches my learning style. I have good friends who I know from long discussions and debates are just as intelligent as myself but didn't ever experience organized learning in a way that clicked for them, and I have seen the disadvantages that has put them under.\n\nI think the reason why the outreach programs I observed/participated in during college worked so well and seemed so effective can be put down to providing learning experiences that are in different learning formats than what students experienced in school. I honestly think that even one \"aha moment\" where learning clicks makes a difference for a young student, because it can overwrite the idea that school is hard because they aren't smart enough, and instead it is hard because it isn't being presented in a way they like to learn... showing that learning can happen in many different ways and all are equally valuable is so powerful.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "I'm all for focusing help to people with economic hardship, but to consider skin color is wrong and is by definition racist.

Caveat, of course, is that VW has been threatening this for years (for example they made a universal electric chassis in 2018 or 2019 that they said they could put multiple bodies on like lego) and they're still nowhere to be seen, I bet my bottom dollar though, once we hit economies of scale they're going to splash in, it's not like they're generations behind tesla's tech, also nissan and toyota. All these companies can design and rollout 10 models for every 1 Tesla, they aren't some Fisker or Nikola (Nikola naming their company Nikola was the first sign they were full of it and just trying to ride tesla btw...)\n\nAlso, competitors like Rivian are aggressively laying down infrastructure in areas Tesla is behind in (check out episodes 1/2 of \"Long Way Up\" for example), like south America where Tesla's model of luxury-down isn't viable (as it is in EU / USA /China).\n\nAnd speaking of China, how long will Tesla last there when China has Nio picking up? Is it going to get googled to China's baidu? Inside China, 2 years ago, Tesla was hot because you could get around the license plate lottery in T1 cities (only a certain amount of licenses allowed each year) with an electric and Tesla was the only reasonable option, not the case anymore, I see way more of those Nio SUVs now. How about the internet connectivity for Tesla's smart bs? How much snappier will Nio be phoning home / integrating with the Chinese walled ecosystem?

Can tesla use others' charging infrastructure? can their branding successfully compete and jump into a hostile market?).

Nothing can ever get to trillions without that.  Promise, hope, hype, potential can only get things so far.  At some point, Joe the plumber has to get off his wallet and peel some greenbacks out.  \n\nApple has it because people pull out their wallets and drop serious money for phones.  Big money.  Relentlessly.  They hardly question the price.  Amazon has it because people spend real big money to buy... well,  everything.  Google and Facebook have it because advertisers avalanche them with money every day.  (Note that it doesn't actually matter if the ads get clicked, or if they work, just that someone pays real money to place them.) \n\nSo then we get into things like Netflix.  Yes, a lot of people pay, but not much per person,  Hence Netflix is financially very shaky (a fact which is widely unknown and misunderstood).  Netflix has not been able to, nor can they, turn up the prices very much.  If they did, some Joe the plumbers would say enough already, and a non-trivial number would close their wallet.  Nobody is doing that to Apple or Amazon, at least not yet.  Advertisers are not doing that to Google/Facebook yet either.

If they lose customers, there is no waiting list of replacements. \n\nSince this week's move in DIS stock is all about streaming, consider that Disney Plus subscriber numbers aren't based in consumers opening their wallets.

Free to $3/month doesn't meet the concept of customers eagerly opening their wallets with big amounts.  \n\nIn fact, prior to the last couple of weeks of Disney Plus/Mandalorian hype, you would have seen lots of people saying they probably wouldn't be continuing their subscription, even at cheap prices.  You also saw some questioning how much more milk can Disney wring out of Star Wars and Marvel.  The last several Star Wars films have disappointed, and Marvel is scraping further reaches of the barrel with each outing.  Have those serious concerns somehow been fixed?  Not really.\n\nDisney needs to figure out a way to dramatically increase prices without causing customer revolt.

When nobody signed up voluntarily, they've done dances to try and hide the sub numbers, and now they're totally rejigging the subscription service to cloud the waters with Fitness Plus, News Plus and other confusion.\n\nIn Disney's case they screwed up by devaluing their entire catalog.  They've taught people that 500 movies is worth $0-$3 when a year prior those 500 titles on blu-ray or theater had an implied value of $15,000.  That's not to say that someone would pay $15,000 for Disney Plus, it's to point out the nuclear annihilation of perceived value.  They went from having a perception of a treasure vault, where one moldy title can be triumphantly released, with scarcity value to resell at a premium over and over and over and over and over - to \"here's everything we own in a junk pile, help yourself.\"\n\nIn doing so, you train consumers as to the value of your offering.

But once that percentage becomes high – 40%, 50% or higher, then obviously it begins to have an effect,” Sunder says.\n\nIt's already at 20%, and this is enough to distort prices and affect price discovery, especially if it's a growing source of inflows.\n\n>“Price discovery is what we call a public good, like a broadcast signal from a radio station. The question is, who should pay for it?” Sunder says. “Everybody benefits from an informed market, but the cost of informing the market is paid by people who do the hard work.\n\n>“Price discovery cannot take place if Shyam doesn’t do any homework – doesn’t do any digging, has no expertise, doesn’t learn about the products and competition and price and technology of the firm, and just says, ‘Oh! The price of this firm should not be $50, it should be $75,’” he says.\n\nInflows into passive funds are massive and are already big enough for the tail to wag the dog. It's compounded by \"closet indexing\":\n\n>Index funds not only follow indexes, but encourage active managers to stay close [compositionally] to the index, a phenomenon called “closet indexing,” where investors pay for active management but get index-like results because the fund company fears shareholder reaction if returns deviates sharply from the benchmark.\n\nWith respect to price discovery, Nikkei may not have appreciated much over the past three decades but if you picked the right stocks (price discovery), you'd have done very well. \n\n\nAnd for people who think indexes aren't distorting markets- \n\n(1) you fucking boomers don't actually trade so you have no idea the difference in trading e.g. LOW vs HD \n\n(2) Tesla over the past month and into next week\n\nFinally, why should the entire market go up over time? Demand growth, and inflation. In stable countries, both of these result from population tending to increase over time. This is ultimately not sustainable, and given patterns in developed nations, population growth is unlikely to continue without massive replacement immigration (usually from poorer countries that may not share the host country's values or culture), and it's a question of how crowded and degraded an environment, society and lifestyle we allow ourselves before we say enough is enough. \n\nThis is why we to colonize offworld I suppose- corporate profits require it.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Indexing actually doesn't effect price discovery because there will always be active managers who sell their management skills to \"beat\" the market.

{"title": "Its a Boomer play, but its guaranteed money: $GE Leaps", "selftext": " So, this DD isn't actual TA. It is a series of (what I believe) are **very** safe assumptions: a combination of political analysis, energy trends, and inevitable nation-wide \"**must have**\" investments. WARNING: this is long. By necessity, one assumption leads to another. I'll give you the **one sentence TLDR** up front, but because this is an assumption-chain, I encourage you to read this post\n\n\\----\n\nTL/DR: \n\n**In order for Biden to get a quick win for what is looking like unfavorable (to Dems) 2022 midterms, he will first shoot for a massive infrastructure bill. Either way Georgia goes, Dems won't blow up the filibuster. Therefore, if he wants to have any \"green\" policies in his first term, he has to make it super amenable to Republicans. (1) Connecting \\*\\*rich\\*\\* renewable areas (mostly Republican states) by extensive HVDC lines to (2) an enhanced nationwide Grid (HVDC lines) will kill two birds with one stone. This \\^ infrastructure is inevitable, either way. $GE is the #1 and only American HVDC provider, 220k workers +. $GE Renewables don't contribute to revenue right now, but HVDC + Wind (which will be yuge) make it a massive discount rn.** \n\n\\-----\n\nI am going to lay down a series of linear assumptions and realities below. I feel like these assumptions are all safe, therefore, it is highly likely that the outcome I describe comes to fruition within the next 4 years. \n\n1. **EVs are going to see mass adoption**. Every automaker + Apple is trying to get in on this. BEV advantages are simply too great. It is highly likely that by 2025, 30% or more of the U.S. fleet will be electric. This will only continue to 2030. \n\n2. **This will cause big increases in demand on the grid**. Go google around: Grid owners are ecstatic about this. The average American home uses \\~33 kWh of energy per day. I own a model 3, and BARELY drive (i dont commute) and still use \\~10kWh per day for driving. A commuter may use around 30-35 kWh per day just to drive. By 2025, if \\~30% of the U.S. fleet is electric, that'll cause a significant increase in grid demand. More important, though, is that energy generation investment takes time. Grid owners know this is coming. They will beef up generation faster and faster as the U.S. economy becomes more **electrified** instead of based on fossil fuels. \n\n3. **Added capacity is likely to be green**. This has 2 causes. (1) Finance: Coal isn't cost competitive with solar and wind anymore. Solar is getting very, very cheap and more and more efficient. Offshore wind is having a renaissance. Nuclear is greener, but more expensive (\\~$4,200 per kW), and NIMBYism will prevail. Solar/wind + batteries is cheaper than $4,200 per kW right now. Additionally, Alaskan oil can't even get bank financing now, and Coal isn't expanding. People see the end is near. (2) Politics. Dem administration for the next 4 years, and green energy isn't the political football it was 10 years ago. Fighting renewables isn't the focus of the right anymore. Additionally, Democrats resist natural gas expansion: remember the Keystone pipeline? Natural gas is pretty green and cheap af, but its not everywhere, and I deem it unlikely that population centers (NE Corridor, Cali, Chicago, etc etc) are going to be OK with more and more natural gas plants. I deem it unlikely that we're gonna be a 50%+ natural gas country. \n\n4. **Biden will do an infrastructure bill**. This will happen. Its popular, its needed, and its perfect for his huge desire to be seen as a bipartisan president. \n\n5. **Biden will try and include moderate green elements in this bill because he knows he won't get green policies otherwise**. Even if the two Georgia seats go blue, there is \\*\\*ZERO\\*\\* chance the Dems blow the filibuster. You have (1) a president that won by a narrow margin, that (2) isn't that popular, (3) who has a bad-looking 2022 midterm, that (4) won't run in 2024 cause hes ancient, with (5) a not-too-popular VP, can't afford to run roughshod over norms and weaken their 2022 prospects. 50-50 plus Kamala casting the deciding vote? Please. Not happening.\n\n6. **Green elements in an infrastructure bill will have to benefit Red states** in order to get passed. We're not gonna get a carbon tax / cap and trade system. We're not gonna get massive oil taxes\n\n7. **A lot of Red states are RICH in renewables**. Look at these maps ([https://www.nrel.gov/gis/solar.html](https://www.nrel.gov/gis/solar.html)) for U.S. solar, and this map ([https://energy.maryland.gov/Pages/Info/renewable/windmaps.aspx](https://energy.maryland.gov/Pages/Info/renewable/windmaps.aspx)) for U.S. wind. What do you notice? For the most part, **there are huge wind opportunities in the Midwest**. **There is huge solar potential across Texas and the South**. Outside of California and Northeast Corridor offshore wind, renewables are concentrated in the Midwest and South. \n\n8. **Right now, we can't take full advantage of these areas because the infrastructure to transport 2025-2030 sized energy demands to population centers don't exist**. This is key. Right now, the U.S. energy grid is largely disconnected in terms of HVDC lines (high voltage lines capable of transmitting huge amounts of power with minimal loss: it resembles small, little fiefdoms. Google \"U.S. HVDC Map\" (make sure you're looking at the current ones--not the projections). We don't have that much HVDC infrastructure. In this past, there wasn't a huge emphasis because there wasn't that much need....renewables price efficiency didn't make for THAT compelling of a need, and localized Grid owners made-do with the status quo. **HVDC network improvement is INEVITABLE.** Renewables are too cheap, and the efficiencies inherent in concentrating wind and solar where appropriate are too vast. Right now, as you read this, there is an UNDERSEA Ultra HVDC cable being laid between Australia and Singapore to transport solar power. I shit you not. Europe and China are building vast HVDC and Ultra HVDC lines right now. **Look at this wiki page:** [**https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\\_of\\_HVDC\\_projects**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HVDC_projects)**. See how many are in Asia/Euro vs the U.S.? Its a fucking joke.** It is extremely unlikely that we're gonna just slap solar and wind where they are sub-optimal, rather than seek greater ROI. Mass HVDC lines are inevitable. \n\n9. General Electric is the only large American HVDC provider. GE employs 200,000+ Americans. It is literally one of the oldest American companies. It has a super American brand name, and is politically connected. \n\n10. HVDC is **expensive**. I'm not an expert, but because of NIMBY, its likely that a lot of HVDC will be buried along rail lines (From what I read). HVDC between hundreds of wind/solar fields across the U.S. will need to be built, plus HVDC / Ultra HVDC between renewable zones to NE Corridor, Chicago, California. I'd google around for figures, but basically, its $$$$$$$$$. \n\n11. **Right now,** General Electric's Renewables sector barely brings in any revenue (17% 2019 revenue, around $15 billion [https://www.statista.com/statistics/245430/revenue-of-general-electric-by-segment/#:\\~:text=Aviation%20and%20power%20are%20the,U.S.%20dollars%20one%20year%20before](https://www.statista.com/statistics/245430/revenue-of-general-electric-by-segment/#:~:text=Aviation%20and%20power%20are%20the,U.S.%20dollars%20one%20year%20before).). The new CEO is actually pretty fucking great ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.\\_Lawrence\\_Culp\\_Jr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._Lawrence_Culp_Jr)). He turned Danaher around, and is setting up GE for success. GE has a TON of debt (debt/equity above 6.0), but what will happen to the stock when GE is given absolutely gigantic contracts in order to buff up the U.S. Grid? They really are the only American company with the production/size ability to do this. What happens when the GE Renewables sector grows by 4-5x over the next 10 years? Grid improvements + Wind turbines are going to go up bigly. That $15 billion revenue line item may increase dramatically. \n\nIf you read this far, let me restate that this isn't TA. I don't have strikes for you. I don't know how to value HVDC and Wind over the next decade. However, I have a **STRONG** feeling in my nips that $GE is going to be a major American comeback story, and \\^ that political/economic/renewable trends make it exceedingly likely that GE will have huge grid contracts coming up. **How much of this is already baked into the price? I have no idea, but I do know that the big boys don't gamble on Adderall rantings like this, so it probably isn't baked in.** \n\nI'm using GE to add some safety to my current 100% TSLA portfolio.
