{"title": "$SLV is not going to get squeezed...$SLV is the Trojan Horse for the squeeze THAT'S ALREADY HAPPENING", "selftext": "I have no horse in the GME \"fight\" right now.  I wish you all the best, and it is the biggest trading mistake of my life so far.  I was talking about GME with my friends in March 2020, and even did trade some options then for a loss.  I must have read DFV at some point, as we were discussing Burry and a \"technical short squeeze\" happening.  But I missed the real boat, so good on DFV and all of the rest of you degenerates.  \n\nInstead, I focused my market attention during quarantine on precious metals.  My opinion is that in the long term (10+ years) they will provide the only real hedge against inflation in the world as every CB on the planet is exploding the supply of fiat to deal with COVID economic disruption.  \n\nIn the short term, I believe that the \"powers that be\" are engineering the largest short squeeze in the history of markets.  We do not have the power to effect whether this happens, it is simply an inevitability.  HFs, banks, and other large institutions are going to extract an enormous amount of wealth from the world during this squeeze.  This money will be taken from the future pocket of every consumer of industrial goods for the next several decades in the form of inflated prices on everything: batteries, electronics, solar panels, EVs...even jewelry and silverware.  \n\nWe cannot stop them, but I have decided to try to hop on for the ride.  The last few months aside, I never saw WSB as a force for societal change, because the people who control the money are always going to win the most in the end.  WSB is a place where we can learn the tricks of a market that is structurally rigged against us, and use those tricks to our advantage.  To use an analogy that I think we all know: I am not, and will never be, Ender.  But I can learn that the Enemy's Gate is Down, and play The Game that way.\n\n\n**The tl;dr is this: the market for silver is the most manipulated physical market in the history of the world.  $SLV is the vehicle that is currently being used behind the scenes to vaccum up ownership of every available physical bar of silver in major bullion vaults in the world.  When it has completed doing that, the \"paper\" markets that have held down the price of silver for decades will become disconnected from the physical markets.  The energy that has been artificially held back for decades by this paper will explode the price of physical silver, and I have no idea how high it will go.  $SLV will stand (mostly) alone as the world's exchange traded product for electronic trading of physical silver.**\n\n\n\n# LET'S START AT THE BEGINNING: WHY IS SILVER IMPORTANT?\n\nSilver has been used as real currency for thousands of years, and there is an argument to be made for returning to \"sound\" money through the use of silver and gold.  However, that is not the argument that I am making.\n\nSilver is a highly industrial metal, and it's usage for industry will only continue to expand as we electrify the future.  Silver is important for electrical applications b/c it is the most-conductive / least-resistive metal in the universe (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistivity_and_conductivity#Resistivity_and_conductivity_of_various_materials).  It is used heavily in all electronic applications (even more since RoHS has pushed us away from Tin/Lead and towards Tin/Silver solder blends, with silver being added to mitigate the longevity problems of 100% Tin solder growing Tin whiskers and shorting out components).  But the largest new demands on silver are going to come from solar panels and EVs.  Utility-scale solar is now virtually tied with wind as the cheapest new sources of energy in the world and is only getting cheaper every year.  As fossil fuel plants continue to reach the end of their service life, they are going to be replaced with solar and wind technologies.  As EVs become more prevalent, their components (ESPECIALLY their batteries) will produce additional demand for Silver.\n\nAs smart investors are wont to do, this coming demand for industrial silver has been front-run and large quantites of silver have been sucked into investment products so that they can produce financial returns when demand begins to increase.  2020 showed remarkable investor interest in silver, to the tune of an estimated 350Mtoz moving into exchange traded products like $SLV.  $SLV alone added ~200Mtoz of silver to it's holdings in 2020.\n\nUnfortunately for the market, supply cannot meet demand: Of the 930.9Mtoz estimated for 2020 demand, only 236Mtoz was available for physical investment, because the rest was consumed by industrial uses.  This means that $SLV alone absorbed almost the entire world's capacity for silver investment in 2020, and as you'll see soon, this is only accelerating in 2021.\n\nSource for demand/supply/investment numbers: https://www.silverinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/SilverInstitute2020InterimPR.pdf\n\n\n# LETS GET PHYSICAL, PHYSICAL\n\nNow it's important to understand that huge amounts of \"silver\" is traded on \"paper\" markets, and these markets have historically decided the approximate cost of physical silver in the world, in the form of the \"spot price\".  I'm not going to give anyone a primer on how this works, go read about the London Fix and COMEX paper on your own time.  But the important thing to know is that there are a bunch of silver bars in vaults in London and in the U.S., and electronic claims on them are traded on the LBMA and COMEX continuously, without the silver ever leaving the vaults.  \n\nHowever, these vaults have concrete numbers of physical bars in them, and trading contracts against them technically means that you can show up at a window somewhere and demand your 5x 1000oz bars that a COMEX warrant entitle you to.  This redemption happens all the time, and it can be used to extract physical silver from the unallocated storage at bullion vaults and release it to industrial or consumer bullion uses.  However, these bars can also be moved into \"registered\" or \"allocated\" accounts without them leaving the overall vault storage.  This means that a quantity of individual silver bars that an owner holds title to can be physically moved inside the vault onto a different rack, and the owner has individual serial numbers of bars that they own.  These bars can be withdrawn on demand only by their owner and are not available for general redemption of a COMEX warrant.\n\nSo how many bars are there? Well between LBMA and COMEX, there are 1480.3Mtoz sitting in vaults (sources below when I start doing math).  This includes all allocated AND unallocated bars.  Now, obviously London and NY are separated by an ocean, but people always like to bring up that bars could be moved b/w London <-> American COMEX vaults.  This is an enormous undertaking, but let's make a \"spherical chicken in a vaccuum\" level assumption and say that LBMA + COMEX vaults are a singular source of inventory for both $SLV and other market participants.\n\nIf you read the $SLV S-1 (which I did: https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1330568/000119312505127244/ds1.htm) you would learn that the custodian of the $SLV trust is required to hold all silver weight (with an exception for 1100toz of unallocated, lol) that is owned by the trust in allocated accounts, where the individual bars are physically segregated inside the vaults, and the serial numbers of the owned bars are explicitly recorded.  The idea that there is \"no physical silver\" backing the SLV trust and \"you could get settled with cash\" is _ridiculous_.  iShares publishes a report listing every serial number of every bar that is owned by the trust, along with the total weight contained in the bars.  It is 10847 pages long (you can read it here if you have trouble sleeping at night: https://emea-markets.jpmorgan.com/metalicsWebAppJanus/publicUnauthenticated/BONY_SLV.pdf) and is updated frequently.\n\nThe underlying silver is _owned_ by the trust.  It cannot be removed from the trust unless \"baskets\" of 50000 shares are redeemed by an \"Authorized Participant\" which is only a few large brokers.  It cannot be removed by the bullion vaults and given to other customers because it is physically segregated inside the vaults.\n\nPeople who have recently beaten down the idea of a silver squeeze love to talk about how JP Morgan is the custodian for the SLV trust.  And because JPM just paid a $1B fine for historical manipulation of the paper silver market, they aren't going to be honest about this.  This is crazy talk.\n\nWhen it comes to the dishonesty of a big bank, there is \"fraud\" and there is FRAUD.  \"Fraud\" would be them saying \"Oh sorry, we didn't realize that a laundromat bringing in $300k/week of dirty dollar bills was out of the ordinary\". \"Fraud\" happens all the time, and the banks get away with it regularly.  FRAUD would be them saying \"Oh yes, 3rd party customer (iShares) who services dozens of other large banking institutions in the world, here is objective evidence, with serial numbers, that we have these silver bars in the vault\" and then just making up the data.  It is QANON-level crazy, IMHO, to think that JPM is going to commit FRAUD by publishing a list of serial numbers that is completely fake.  \n\nI believe the exact opposite: since they _have_ just gotten caught, they are playing it straight this time and have just switched sides in order to go long.  On the COMEX alone, JP Morgan Chase is long 193.9Mtoz, or just north of $5B.\n\n(COMEX depository data by weight: https://www.cmegroup.com/delivery_reports/Silver_stocks.xls)\n\nThe problem for the futures and options markets is that their continual trading of paper contracts is chasing a smaller and smaller amount of physical silver that is not owned by $SLV.  And the market participants (minus, now, JPM) who have gotten away with naked selling of paper contracts and mostly settling them for cash are going to soon find the underlying vaults empty and no metal to give to warrant holders who come looking for it.\n\n\n\n# HOW BIG OF A PROBLEM IS $SLV FOR THE NAKED SHORTS IN THE PAPER MARKET? LET'S DO SOME MATH.\n\n$SLV inventory math:\n\n$SLV is holding 669,357,789.40 troy ounces in trust, and has 720,500,000 shares outstanding.  \n\n(If you are curious why $SLV/share trades below the spot price, it's because: 669.4Mtoz / 720.5M shares = .929 toz / share)\n\n($SLV data from here: https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239855/ishares-silver-trust-fund?qt=SLV#/ )\n\n(screenshot from tonight for posterity: https://imgur.com/a/0sqcMFr)\n\n\nBullion vault inventory math:\n\nLondon (LBMA) silver stocks are 1080.5Mtoz (http://www.lbma.org.uk/london-precious-metals-physical-holdings-statistics)\n\nUS COMEX silver stocks are 399.8Mtoz (https://www.cmegroup.com/delivery_reports/Silver_stocks.xls)\n\n669.4/(1080.5 + 399.8) = 45.2% of the vaulted silver in the world is already owned by SLV\n\nSubtracting what SLV already owns, leaves us with: (1080.5 + 399.8) - 669.4 = 810.9Mtoz\n\n(This is _completely_ ignoring the fact that a lot of that remaining silver is owned in registered or allocated accounts by individual owners.  E.g. there is 150.2Mtoz in \"registered\" on the COMEX which means those bars are already specifically deeded to an individual owner. But they could theoretically sell it to SLV so I included it as available.)\n\n810.9Mtoz is the ABSOLUTE THEORETICAL MAXIMUM available in LBMA + COMEX silver that is not _already_ owned by SLV.\n\n\nNow how short are the shorts?  Some more math:\n\nOI on COMEX futures: https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/precious/silver-futures-and-options.html\n\n    + 179786*5000toz\n    + 130402*5000toz \n    +   8245*1000toz\n    +   1903*2500toz\n    ----------------\n    1,563,942,500 = 1563.9Mtoz \nin currently open interest that could be demanded for delivery.  Just on the COMEX, there could be demand for twice as much silver as there is in the combined LBMA + COMEX vaults that is not explicitly owned by $SLV right now.  \n\nCaveats: \n\n- I have not included any London futures contracts that may have claims on metal here.  I am not versed in their contracts at all and don't have a good data source right now.  If anyone knows how to calculate the short obligation for London I would be glad to add it.\n\n- I have not analyzed any of the strike prices on COMEX options or dates on COMEX futures...some of them could be way out of the money or way in the future.  Many silver producers sell futures years in advance to lock in prices, and then deliver the physical to satisfy the contracts.\n\nUsing the same basic methodology–total shorts divided by shares [toz in this case] outstanding–as is used on a stock to calculate short interest (and gave us the infamous 140% short interest on GME) we get......drumroll please:\n\n1563.9 short / 810.9 physical = 192.9% short interest.\n\n**OPEN INTEREST ON COMEX SILVER FUTURES AND OPTIONS IS EQUIVALENT TO A 192.9% SHORT INTEREST AGAINST ALL LONDON AND U.S. AVAILABLE INVENTORY.**  \n\nBut it gets even worse.\n\n\n\n\n\n# WANNA ADD A GAMMA SQUEEZE??\n\nI pulled the data for all current OI in SLV options.  There is a large number (5.7 million) of call contracts open (here are the totals: https://imgur.com/tiqPA34)\n\nUsing the .929toz/share number, we can calculate that there are up to 527.2Mtoz that would have to be bought during an absolute runaway Gamma Squeeze.  Call options on $SLV max out right now at $55, so the spot price would only have to increase by around 122% to reach the point that all of that weight would need to have been purchased.  But at some point, it could become self-reinforcing, and the gamma squeeze continues to cause more gamma squeezing.  \n\nI believe that this almost happened Sunday evening (2021-01-31) as evidenced by the huge premium that $SLV was trading to the futures price for a few minutes when trading opened.  (My comparison chart: https://i.imgur.com/UPjL3zm.png) \n\nThe Silver ETF that trades on Sunday in Tel Aviv (https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/TCHF82:IT) closed up >6% (and was consistenly rising for the entire session) before any american spot markets opened.  I believe that hedging algorithms at MM firms that write options saw this spike as a need to buy shares in $SLV to cover their deltas, and so they bought the opening of $SLV like crazy.  $SLV opened up 17.6%, while paper only opened up about 6%.  Paper market players had to sell 23.8Mtoz of paper in the first minute of trading to keep the price under control.  I have never seen an imbalance like this before, and it was covered up quickly (within 2 hours of trading).  But to me, it sounds like Vincent's heartbeat monitor in GATTACA when he runs out of fake signal: there was a cover up required to hide this explosion.\n\nWhen the day comes that this cover up is not executed properly, stuff is going to get ugly, b/c $SLV won't just gamma squeeze like a normal stock...\n\n\n\n# BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE! A TRADITIONAL GAMMA/SHORT SQUEEZE WILL SEEM LIKE NOTHING IN SILVER\n\nThe squeeze in silver will be FAR WORSE than the combination of a gamma and short squeeze in a stock, because shares of stock cannot be removed from the market.  Eventually somebody holding $VW or $GME is going to say \"sure, I'll sell at $42,000.69 per share\" and that share can go back to cover a short.  But if instead of doing that, the holder of that share withdrew it from the market by converting it to a physical token b/c they thought that the physical token would be more valuable than the share (the retail premium on physical silver vs. paper silver), the short interest would INCREASE as shares were converted into tokens.  And since there are currently more \"shares\" of silver than there are bars of silver in the vault, the shorts can be caught with a literally illiquid market that has nothing to buy.\n\nZero.  Zilch.  No silver available.\n\nThe doomsday scenario (for paper silver holders and writers) is the following combination:\n\n- holders of COMEX warrants will see the rising premium of physical bullion to the spot price and decide to redeem their warrants for physical \n\n- a rising spot price will Gamma Squeeze the writers of $SLV options into buying more shares in a runaway fashion and the trust will absorb all available vault inventory as it issues new shares\n\nCOMEX warrant holders who try to demand metal that doesn't exist will literally break the market.  \n\nThe CBOE will probably step in and decide to force settle the contracts for cash at the last known good price, and **COMEX paper warrants will cease trading forever.**\n\nThe physical market price will then be disconnected from the paper market, and $SLV as an exchange traded product will stand (mostly) alone as the new \"paper\" market for silver.\n\n\n\n\n# SO WTF DO I DO? [NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE]\n\nWell I could always buy physical silver, if I can stomach the premium and wait 8 weeks for it to show up.  Or, I could just get long on $SLV.  Since I believe that $SLV will stand alone after the dust settles as the one true claim on bars in the vaults, I could be long the actual $SLV ticker in several ways:\n\n- Buying shares (duh, but it worked for $GME)\n\n- Buying long dated calls (Gamma Squeeze go BRRRRR, but who knows when)\n\n- Buying option spreads (my personal favorite)\n\nIf I wanted to maximize my contribution to the Gamma Squeeze, I'd probably buy as much Delta/$ as I could get using weeklies, which would be 2/5 $26.5C or 2/12 $28C \n\n(Max delta/$ calculations: https://i.imgur.com/Az3o85v.png and https://i.imgur.com/eRPQo6k.png)\n\nCurrent open positions for me are: (https://imgur.com/vWZrziG)\n\n- Jan'22 50/55 call spread (costs .17, moonshot pays $5, 29x)\n\n- 4/16 40/55 call spread (costs .18, moonshot pays $15, 83x)\n\n- 2/5 $26.5 call (to maximize delta/$)\n\n- jan'22 $40 call (to minimize risk of missing the big one)\n\n- $AG shares and jan'23 10/35 call spread (added, sorry i forgot this one: https://imgur.com/fz80V6J)\n\n\nFootnote, all the pictures I think I used, in case i missed something: https://imgur.com/a/0sqcMFr", "id": "lc8vgo", "created_utc": 1612417671.0, "score": 757, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 181, "comments": [{"body": "How is the silver price crashing on the spot price and the price of premiums is rising massively? 10+ days for shipping on physical silver, what is going on??", "score": 90, "replies": [{"body": "you are literally asking the $60B question.\n\nwhen the spot price causes all physical products to be out of stock even with increasing physical premiums...is the spot price truly reflective of the real metal?\n\nthis happened back in march as well...spot crashed to like $12 but physical price was $20+ and stuff was out of stock everywhere.  \n\nif the spot price doesn't match the real world, THEN IT'S A FAKE PRICE", "score": 93, "replies": [{"body": "OP, you need to comment on the $SLV prospectus.

Everyone wants to bring up inflation in regards to Dogecoin, but I look at the dollar. Trillions of dollars are produced each year yet inflation doesn’t destroy the dollar. Why is that? Because Americans spend more than what is made each year. As long as that trend continues for Dogecoin, it will not loose its value.

I started investing for the first time in my life last June. So please excuse if my post comes of as “amateurish”. I’m still learning the lingo. \n\nMy portfolio is 60% so far with about $1/ day in dividend returns that more than cover the margin I’m using. I do understand that A TON of this has to do with timing. We are in a crazy bull market right now. \n\nI focus around half my portfolio on dividend paying blue chip stocks. I try to allocate at least 30% of my portfolio to growth stocks in the $25-$45 range. I consume lot of DD from CNBC, Barron’s, Reddit, etc. I simply play the momentum of hot stock until the wheels fall. Nothing fancy, just following what the experts think and my own intuition. \n\nThis is what I currently have, I’m pretty long on these for the most part. \n\nAPPL - where most of my money is. Self explanatory; it’s the best company in the world. It’s not only a blue chip stock, but a growth stock. I brought thousands worth at the split and plan to never sell. \n\nSNAP and PINS - I brought both when they were low last year. SNAP has given me my best return at over 130%. I am long on both. They are a “safe”  place for advertisers to put their dollars. They’re gonna eat fb and twitters lunch in the coming quarters. \n\nC - my second best performer with a huge return. I brought a ton at $48. It’s blue chip and pays an insane dividend. I am never selling. \n\nWells - brought a ton of wells at a great price. Have a nice return. The dividend is suspended right now but the stock will pop once they reinstate it. I may start reading this stock since it seems to be bouncing between $32 - $29. \n\nBCS - holding this until they reinstate the dividend. When they do this should get a nice pop. \n\nKBWD - reliable dividend stock. Has given me a small return and I use it to help pay my margin. I tend to put my money in here when I’m deciding what stock to buy. \n\nDIS - brought some shares when it crashed last year at $124. Got very luckily and wish I brought more. Never selling, super long on Disney and will buy at any weakness. With their IP, Disney’s. streaming platform has more potential than anyone. \n\nICLN - clean energy play. Clean energy is going to be huge in the Biden administration. I put a ton into this during the election. Gotta a nice return, but this will pop more once he starts sign bills. \n\nPLUG - few things a about this stock - I like the performance. It has drops, but when it raises is always gains. Similar to SNAP. It’s a Wall Street darling. It’s a clean energy play. I got in early and have 42% return so far. \n\nT - safe boomer stock. Glorified savings account used for dividends. \n\nNIKE - had a good position, got lucky and brought before the dip before it popped this week. It’s as blue chick as you can get and one of the strongest brands in the world. Oh and they pay a nice dividend. \n\nPFE - this is one of my worst performers. I brought pretty high when the vaccine was announced. I have since trimmed my position. I’m still long because it’s a great company and I think the technology used for the Covid vaccine will bring other goodies. They also pay a nice dividend. \n\nPSTH - brought Ackman’s SPAC as a nice price. I believe he is going announce something big. We will see. \n\nIPOE - another one I got lucky on. I heard SPAC was buying SoFi and I wanted some fintech exposure. This popped during the whole Robin fiasco and I believe it’s only go to go higher. \n\nEXPR - threw $100 bucks at it, and I’m down by a lot. Doesn’t make sense to sell right now because of the small investment. I doubt anything will happen, we’ll see. \n\nOne more thing about my portfolio that you may notice; in not playing the pandemic or reopening at all (maybe PFE but i would invest in them even without a COVID vaccine) My risk tolerance won’t allow it. I have no idea what the world will look like when it reopens. I wanted my focus to be on companies that (for the most part) will survive if we have a market correction, bubble burst, etc.\n\nMy personal view of corrections, bubbles, etc. is that there is so much new money, government involvement , etc. this bull market still has a long way to go.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "u dont sound like a noob at all nice holdings, whats kbwd? what do they do?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks!

If you have been keeping in touch, I mentioned this stock back in the $6 area and we managed to hit $28+ in such a short period of time. Lots and lots of firepower. To be frank, and many who have messaged me know, I started scaling out past 15 and closed out last Monday in the $20 area. Why? Because I wanted the stock to cool off and to let the market determine who really wanted to invest and own the stock, and who wanted it for the trade cause BRRRRR BB GO UP. Well, I’m back in, and here are my updates and reasons why. In addition, BB is decoupling from the GME trade, and should see much more lift comparatively.\n\n**Intro**\n\nMan Blackberry, who the hell thought I’d be investing in you after the fall of BBM and Brickbreaker. Well, strap in folks as I take you through one of the most bullish stories in stonk history, and it all starts with one statement. Everything you’re thinking about with Blackberry at the moment, is wrong.\n\nIt is not a phone company. It is not telling you to use BBM. It is a software, automotive, and cybersecurity company that is about to make a killing.\n\n**Let’s begin**:\n\nBB stock price, 6.71 as of Close on 1-6-2021. \nBB stock price, 9.84 as of Close on 1-18-2021. Only 9 days since I first posted. This is just the beginning.\nBB stock price, 12 as of Close on 2-3-2021. Hit a high of 28.77 the week prior…this moved so fast.\n\n**Technical 2.4.2021**\n\nOn the 4hr, volume is really cooling down lately and it seems to me that sellers are REALLY drying up. People that didn’t even want to part with their BB shares capitulated. Now we likely wash out yesterday’s nice move upwards before continuing to the upside. MACD cross/flip, Moving Averages basing, just looks overall quite nice.\n\n\n**Recent Earnings**\n\nFiscal Quarter End| Date Reported| Earnings Per Share* | Consensus EPS* Forecast | % Surprise\n---|---|----|----|----\nNov 2020\t| 12/17/2020\t| 0\t| -0.04\t| 100\nAug 2020\t| 09/24/2020\t| 0.1\t| -0.02\t| 600\nMay 2020\t| 06/24/2020\t| 0\t| -0.04\t| 100\nFeb 2020\t| 03/31/2020\t| 0.06\t|0.01\t|500\n\nSurprises along the board.\n\nRevenues Q3, $224 MM.\n\nRevenues projected for Q4, $246 MM. This will be beaten immensely.\n\nFull year Guidance 2021, $950 MM. \n\nMkt cap, $4 B. \n\nTotal company non-GAAP revenue of $224 million; total company GAAP revenue of $218 million. Non-GAAP earnings per basic and diluted share of $0.02; GAAP loss per basic and diluted share of $0.23. Net cash generated from operating activities of $29 million.\n\n\n**NEWS EVENTS**\n\nFB settlement\n\nBB won a suit against Zuckerberg $FB related to messaging, whatsapp, and whatnot. This settlement has now occurred. Check Bloomberg for the deets\n\nSomeone I know and trust let me know that there are rumors that the settlement is worth $2B and a 2 year partnership. This is not fact, just rumor, but if it is true that is MASSIVE.\n\nBlackBerry IVY – Intellectual Vehicle Data Platform\n\nThe big kahuna that will change BB for the next few years. Per BB website: “BlackBerry and AWS are joining forces to develop BlackBerry IVY, a scalable, cloud-connected software platform that will allow automakers to create personalized driver and passenger experiences and improve operations of connected vehicles with new BlackBerry QNX and AWS technology.”\n\nWhat does it mean to the end consumer (the automakers)\n\n**IVY Fueling Business Outcomes**\n\nBlackBerry IVY will help automakers and automotive suppliers:\n\n* Fuel Innovation by supporting rapid development of new customer experiences\n* Drive Revenue by unlocking new revenue streams and business models\n* Reduce Costs by moving processing to the edge & reducing raw data transmission\n* Improve Operations with enhanced data visibility and access\n* Expand Ecosystems by unlocking the broader app developer community\nVideos on their YT\n\nWant a TL;DR? Automotive, cloud, cybersecurity, IOT, electric vehicles, every bubble on the planet. And this shit got all of it. Want more info?  [Read this](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/aws) and watch their conferences that they have done or are coming up.\n\nThe IVY deal has so much commercial promise. Manufacturers are going to buy IVY because of the data gathering, but more importantly IVY is going to become the universal app store for automotive apps. The IVY platform will be universal across manufacturers and models so a developer can build an app that will work on any car that has IVY. BB will take an app store like commission on revenue. Billions.\n\nAfter cars, IVY and QNX will move to the broader Internet of Things. Planes, trains, medical devices, EVERYTHING will be connected and needs to be secure. BB has competitive advantages over all the other players, especially Linux because it is not secure, while BB’s QNX has the highest achievable safety certs.\n\nIf the automotive biz wasn’t enough they have interesting offerings in corporate data security, anti-virus, and emergency notification systems. They are literally in some of the hottest spaces you could be right now, with no signs of cooling.\nAs of their conferences, IVY and QNX both seem to be opening up many many more avenues of revenue to tackle within the auto space. Per Steve Rai, what was typically 2-3 avenues of revenue is not 5-6, with IVY being a HUGE 7th.\n\n**Partnerships with big companies**\n\nBlackberry partnered with Zoom (link: https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2020/10/blackberry-and-zoom-together-secure-your-virtual-enterprise-meetings), Microsoft Teams (link: https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/blackberry-athoc-integrates-with-microsoft-teams-for-critical-event-management-301147559.html) and ServiceNow. BB’s Incident Management Response System AtHoc is integrating into the NOW platform. Cybersecurity adding onto big big platforms that exploded this past year. MORE MONEY. I think this should pull above $10 MM per month, $120MM a year? Sounds enticing to me when we are at $~1B revenue with a 76% gross margin.\n\nSony announced a BlackBerry partnership, per CEO @JohnChen on Twitter: Thank you for your partnership @Sony. You are an icon and I look forward to experiencing your #ElectricVehicle embedded with @BlackBerry software. But first, where I can get a #Playstation5? #EV#PS5\n\nBB & BAIDU announced their partnership too!\n\n**Patents**\n\nBB Selling Smartphone Patents to Huawei, more $$$$ coming in. Recent Sale news here: https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-blackberry-sells-90-patents-to-huawei-covering-key-smartphone/?cmpid=rss&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter\n\nBB JUST won a suit against Facebook for one of the patents they hold: https://news.bloomberglaw.com/tech-and-telecom-law/blackberry-and-facebook-are-in-process-of-global-settlement. This is minimum likely worth $500 MM+, but to my knowledge off of some juicy rumors, this is a $2B settlement with FB and a 2 year partnership. MASSIVE.\n\n**Business Implications**\n\nBB makes their money from licensing, cybersecurity (one of the only companies that have not been hacked in this SolarWind shit), BB QNX is already in 175 MM cars worldwide, partnered with XPEV, and is in talks with multiple Tier 1 automakers, 20 different OEMs, and will be in vehicles by 2023. Does that mean anything now? Yes, you dumbass. Per CEO John Chen, my new president, #DidYouKnow @BlackBerry has been selected by 19 of the top 25 #ElectricVehicle manufacturers, and they represent 61% of the Electric Vehicle market?\n\nBubblicious and sexy. Expect some of the big tier 1s like Nissan, Toyota, BMW, and others to jump on this train. Think TSLA doesn’t have competition? They cant even make a billion dollars unless they sell stock.\n\nHere is the biggest catch: Right now the auto industry is actually selling less cars, and many of the EVs that BB is partnered with are really in the liftoff phase. When XPEV (my favorite EV and I am working on my print for them as we speak), NIO, BIDU, Hyundai, get their EV and Self Driving Cars off the ground and start growing their vehicle output, this number will grow and grow. BB is really at the brink of an explosive couple of years. You are entering at the ground floor.\n\n**CONFERENCES**  \n\nBB has just spoken at the following conferences:\nCiti’s 2021 Global TMT West Virtual Conference with the Steve Rai, Blackberry CFO  and John Wall, Co-Head of BlackBerry Technology Solutions (BTS) \n\nJP Morgan 19th Annual Tech / Auto Forum with the Steve Rai, Blackberry CFO  and John Wall, Co-Head of BlackBerry Technology Solutions (BTS) \n\nNeedham’s 23rd Annual Virtual Growth Conference with Ryan Permeh, Blackberry Chief Security Architect & Co-founder of Cylance and Eric Cornelius, Blackberry Chief Product Architect.\n\nUpcoming conference on Feb 22nd, 2 PM EST with **AMZN** and **BB**. Will update with a link when I get the chance\n\n**Conclusion**:\n\nThis stock will generate a lot more cash in the coming years, will gain in the short term by offloading old patents, settling with FB and getting some moolah, growing in their partnership with Bezos gang, roll out to more EVs with Tier 1 and Tier 2 automotive companies, and compete with Tesla on this as well. ~~This trades at $6.70.~~ They already are used by big companies for Access and other Mobile apps, so that someone can securely use their dinky iPhone to work. Think big whales aren’t interested? Look at 2022 2023 option OI. \n\nFrom here, 12.5 leads to 15, 28, and probably some wild momentum to 40-50. More shorts have entered, likely more institutions have entered long. It is an exciting time for Blackberry, let’s roll\n\n**QNX CUSTOMERS** (see anyone you know?)\n\n• BAIDU• XPENG • Sony • NIO • Lucid Motors • PLUS • ARCFOX • DESAY SV • CANOO • DAMON MOTORCYCLES • RENOVO • ARIVVAL • HYUNDAI AUTRON • DENSO • JAGUA LAND ROVER • LG • RENESAS • BYTON • NVIDIA  • QUALCOMM • TATA ELXSI • DELPHI TEAMS • SpaceX • BOSCH • KARMA • AMAZON • Rivian • Lordstown • Fisker • Hyliion\n\nPositions: 4k Shs, 20 jan 21 12.5C leaps", "id": "leohs2", "created_utc": 1612711580.0, "score": 1138, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 183, "comments": [{"body": "So optimistic on BB rn.

{"title": "DD on Corsair ($CRSR)", "selftext": "  \n\n***Full disclosure, I am a shareholder so my opinions can be biased.***\n\nThis is not financial advice but I have tried to do some DD on this so please read to the end. I posted this to WSB yesterday and it didnt get much traction so i'm hoping more people here will find it useful. \n\nFor those of you who might not know what Corsair is, they are a computer parts and peripherals company founded in 1994 that went public in September of 2020. If you have a desktop PC, keyboard, mouse, or are a streamer, chances are you have seen their logo. Corsair Gaming ($CRSR) reports earnings this coming week on Tuesday. In light of that, I have put together a few insights that some of you may find interesting.\n\n**Earnings. Tuesday February 9th**\n\nFirst, a look at the previous quarter’s earnings (Q3 2020)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Q3 2020 Highlights**\n\n\\- Net revenue was $457.1 million, an **increase of 60.7%** year over year\n\n\\- Gamer and creator peripherals net revenue was $161.6 million, an **increase of 128.8%** year over year\n\n\\- Gross profit was $129.9 million, an **increase of 112.4%** year over year\n\n\\- Gross margin was 28%, an **increase of 680 bps** (that’s 6.8%)\n\n\\- Gamer and creator peripherals segment gross profit was $60 million, an **increase of 200.8%** year over year\n\n\\- Gaming components and systems segment gross profit was $67.9 million, an increase of 68.7% year over year\n\n\\- Operating income was $49.7 million, an **increase of 353.6%** year-over-year\n\n\\- Adjusted operating income was $61.4 million, an **increase of 193.7%** year-over-year\n\n\\- Net income was $36.4 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, compared to net income of $1.5 million in the same period a year ago, or $0.02 per diluted share\n\n\\- **Adjusted net income was $48.5 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, an increase of 384.0% year-over-year compared to adjusted net income of $10.0 million, or $0.13 per diluted share.**\n\n**-** Adjusted EBITDA was $63.7 million, an **increase of 184.9%** year-over-year, with adjusted EBITDA margin of 13.9%, an **improvement of 610 bps** year-over-year\n\n**Q3 Earnings Call Highlights (quotes from the call)**\n\n\\- “This last quarter was one with very strong demand, with many major retailers running out of stock of our gear. Our stock situation has gotten better but only a small part of Q3 revenue came from restocking shelves, **with most gear selling as soon as they hit the shelves**.”\n\n\\- “We also recently launched two new microphones under our Elgato brand, Wave 1 and Wave 3, **which were sold out within the first few days of launch**.”\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Catalysts for Growth**\n\nAccording to data released by the International Data Corporation (IDC),\n\n\\- Global gaming PC shipments are expected to jump by 25% by 2024, while **global shipments of gaming laptops, desktop PCs, and monitors jumped 16.2% year over year in 2020 with December 2020 seeing the highest sales of PC components and peripherals on record**.\n\n**-** IDC predicts 2021 to witness a real surge in gaming PCs as new graphics processing units from Nvidia, AMD and Intel are expected to drive prices down and performance up.\n\n**- Global gaming PC sales revenue has jumped 60% in the past 5 years.** In 2015 the global gaming PC market reached $24.6 billion in revenue, which has increased to $39.2 billion in 2020. High end gaming computers represent the largest revenue stream in 2020 at $18.5 billion or 47% of combined profits in 2020\n\n\\- Not only will Corsair be able to capitalize on a gaming PC super cycle upgrade with new GPUs but on October 22, 2020, Corsair announced the launch of their first officially licensed headset for Microsoft Xbox. Corsair will also be able to capitalize on the Sony Playstation and Microsoft Xbox console super cycle using their headsets and Scuf Gaming controllers for consoles. Corsair currently holds patents on several console controllers, Microsoft has licensed these patents to create the Xbox Elite Controller.\n\n\\- According to Corsair\n\n\\- There were 2.6 billion gamers (across all platforms) as of 2019\n\n\\- 11% of leisure time in the US is spent on gaming\n\n\\- 12 billion hours of gaming content was streamed in 2019\n\n\\- 71% of millennial gamers in the US watch gaming content on streaming platforms\n\n\\- Corsair will be able to capture this enormous rise in streaming using their Elgato line of products which enhance the ability of content creators to stream.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Market Share**\n\n\\- Pulled from Corsairs S-1 filing, they currently command over **18% of the US market share in gaming peripherals and nearly 42% of the gaming PC components market share**. This will allow them to capture a substantial portion of revenues from the global gaming peripherals market size which is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate **(CAGR) of 10.4**% from 2020 to 2025 according to grand view research.\n\n**- Ranking of Corsair’s Total US Market Share by Product:**\n\n**-** Keyboards: 2nd\n\n\\- Mice: 3rd\n\n\\- Headsets: 4th\n\n\\- Streaming Peripherals: 2nd\n\n\\- Performance Controllers: 2nd \n\n\\- Memory: 1st \n\n\\- Cases: 1st \n\n\\- Power Supply Units: 1st \n\n\\- Cooling Solutions: 1st \n\n**-** Releases of gaming content with ever-higher graphical requirements will drive consumers to upgrade their components and subsequently their peripherals as well. \n\n\\- **Corsair gaming is an ecosystem of products with a strong and recognizable brand which creates extreme brand loyalty amongst its customers.** This is more of a personal opinion but through my own experience and observation, it seems that when a customer goes to upgrade 1 component from Corsair, several hundred dollars later they come out the other side purchasing a number of internal PC components and have upgraded all of their peripherals (keyboard and mouse), but this is anecdotal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Q4 Earnings & Beyond** (released before the bell on Tuesday February 9th).\n\nThese are predictions and can obviously be taken with a grain of salt but I hope you can understand my rationale\n\n\\- I believe we will see a huge beat on Tuesday’s earnings release. This will be led by the compounding effects of the pandemic stay at home orders along-side an extremely strong holiday season. According to the site: Super Data, sales of digital games experienced a record number at $12 billion in December alone. This was the highest monthly revenue on record with PC games taking the lion’s share of this with a year over year revenue jump of 40% thanks to Cyberpunk 2077. This extremely high demand for PC games will drive the upgrading cycle and demand for Corsairs PC components and their peripherals. \n\n\\- I also believe that Corsair is a long term hold with substantial growth potential as the adoption of gaming grows.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Competitor Comparison**\n\n**-** Corsair is frequently compared to Logitech. \n\n\\- Logitech currently has a market cap of $18.63 billion, Corsair has a market cap of $4.15 billion.\n\n\\- Logitech is expected to post 2020 fiscal year end revenue at $2.9 billion, Corsair is expected to post 2020 fiscal year end revenue at $1.65 billion.\n\n\\- Logitech is expected to post 2020 fiscal year end operating income at $300 million, Corsair is expected to post 2020 fiscal year end operating income at $192 million.\n\n\\- Logitech currently has 169 million shares outstanding with a float of 162 million shares (6% is shorted), Corsair currently has 92 million shares outstanding with a 25 million share float (24% is shorted)\n\n\n**I believe Corsair is severely undervalued**", "id": "let2ki", "created_utc": 1612724928.0, "score": 771, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 182, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 119, "replies": [{"body": "Definitely haven’t missed it if you can get in under 45 on Monday fyi", "score": 71, "replies": [{"body": "Up to $48 already after hours.

Without a healthy PC gaming market no one is going to be buying fancy RAM, fans, cases, etc. and once you get under that level everyone else makes that stuff.

RR's main customer.", "score": 19, "replies": [{"body": "So?\n\nRolls has no current engines suitable for a narrowbody airliner.  None.  Guess where most of Airbus' growth is?  If you said narrowbodies (A220/C-Series, A320) you'd be right.  There are two narrowbodies that use Rolls engines, the Boeing/MD 717 and the Boeing 757.  They both fit very unique niches but production of both has long since stopped and both models are being phased out by airlines.  Meanwhile GE (via CFM) has engines on every single 737 flying and a big chunk of the A320s. Pratt has all of Airbus' A220s.\n\nOkay let's talk widebodies then.  They don't sell as well as narrowbodies by virtue of their size and cost.  The 767 is living on with the KC-46 (which has its own issues), but those are all powered by Pratt.  GE is the single source for current 777/777x engines.  Rolls offers engines for the 787 and they managed to snag exclusive rights to the A330neo and A350.  Great. The neo is limping along sales-wise while the A350 and 787 are doing great.  But there's a catch.  Rolls' Trent engines are unreliable and Rolls has been battling persistent problems with them.  Look at how many 787s were grounded last year waiting for engine replacements (this and the 787 teething problems really hurt Norwegian long haul).  Rolls has gone through a few revisions but the problems remain.  ETOPS certification got clawed back on the Rolls powered 787s.\n\nAnd then there's the whole shift towards using narrowbodies on longer flights.  When air travel recovers you're likely to find that flying a larger chunk of the flights are on narrowbodies.  US flights to Hawaii and transatlantic flights are definitely shifting towards narrowbodies.  The days of being able to hop on a domestic DC-10 or Tristar are long gone.\n\nEven when air travel starts to recover Rolls is not well positioned to profit.  They have a troublesome engine family to deal with (Trent) and no products to compete in the fastest growing market segment.  Yeah, sure, they're too big to fail.  But too big to fail doesn't mean too big to screw over the shareholders.  Rolls will be around in a few decades, your investment in them probably won't.

Selling Covered Call is a great Theta Strategy for that).\n* Fixed timing. This is more on the disciplined side of business, having a set time is so much easier to get disciplined about trading.\n\nLike I said, imo the limited upside when the stock goes balistic is a problem so here is what I use to get around that, here is my actual technique with Theta.\n\n1. CSPs on supports on very few stocks I wouldn’t mind owning even though I always sell before getting assigned.\n2. Loto tickets with short dated calls or ATM CSPs (example PLTR earnings coming in)\n3. LEAPs on the stocks I sell CSPs on to get the upside as well\n\nBasically this technique gives me 2x the upside, let me make 1x in sideways trading and break even on downsides when it doesn’t go down more than 30%, even then, I can roll out options and my LEAPs are long dated anyway.\n\nMy main stocks are Palantir, Nio, MARA and occasionnally TSLA / NVDA credit spreads.\n\nGood fundamental stocks with a hype factor and quite high IV to make the theta dream work.\n\n**My strategy on : NIO**\n\nNio is a great company to start trading CSPs on, it’s event driven with delivery numbers coming in every 2nd of the month, it has NIO day, and a TSLA like hype factor to grow, it’s one of the best company to sell CSPs on because it respects supports in a great way.\n\n[NIO is a really good stock to sell CSPs on](https://preview.redd.it/szy7rzdzcng61.png?width=1442&format=png&auto=webp&s=4dabbeb00e2d1d6cb121a92c00b4e53dea9bc751)\n\nThis is my trading view chart of NIO, really easy to see how supports and trendline get tested with the stock.\n\nHere what I usually do is sell the **45**, **48** and **50** CSP in 20 to 30 days, I do that at the beginning of each week or later if I think I can get a better premium and buy to close at around 80% profits.\n\n**The Loto tickets on : NIO**\n\nAt the start of December NIO was expected to deliver a record number of cars which was expected to boost the stock price, so I sold some ATM puts and some loto calls for after the NIO day scheduled the same week, as you can see, it was a good call.\n\n**LEAPs on : NIO**\n\nAt the end of October I bought 2 LEAPs 35c for Jan15 ‘22 for 8.81, it’s now 32.00 and not planning to sell them until January.\n\nSo here is my technique to profit from upsides, sideways and downsides with a gambling aspect that everyone love. \n\nI post this to share my technique with this subreddit as It has been very profitable for me and would love it to be for someone else, not looking to brag or anything, you can critique as you want I’m open to criticism.\n\n**“But what if there’s a crash ?”** I just close my positions and reverse to selling calls, crash of more than 40% are black swan events tbh.\n\nI basically do the same thing on PLTR, my positions right now are :\n\n* 3x Jan21 ‘22 35c\n* 4x Feb19 ’21 34c\n* \\-5x Feb19 ‘21 35p\n* \\-7x Feb19 ‘21 32.5p\n* 12x Feb19 ‘21 60c\n\nI will sell some of these before earnings on monday and let the rest run because I do believe there will be a big surprise on earnings (Possible FB partnership).", "id": "lgt314", "created_utc": 1612961874.0, "score": 397, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 180, "comments": [{"body": "So you sel CSPs and buy calls on companies you think will run up?

I think it is important to recognize that Leaps are more aggressive than stocks. You can get a greater return but you are at a greater risk. There are a couple points to this. Let's look at a couple things with leaps vs stocks. \n\n1. You do choose the wrong stock and it goes down by 30%. Your leap is 100% loss while yoir stocj is 30% loss.\n\n2. The entire stock market is depressed.  Over the long term stocks go up. We are on an amazing bull run right now where year after year you are seeing returns. It is not like that all the time. Historically there are years where the entire market is down. Not like March where a \"flash crash\" happened but entire years where stocks are now worth less than they were before and don't recover in 3 months. If this happens leaps will lose 100% of value while stocks will come back and lose 0%. \n\nThere are ways to mitigate this with leaps. Don't buy with your entire portfolio so you can buy back in while stocks are down. Buy leaps on companies that may not dip in a recession. But those strategies all take away from profits. \n\nI'm not saying don't buy leaps but I think it is important to know what the risk is and not be blinded by recent above average returns. Leaps can definitely return you above average returns but they can also take a huge chunk out of your portfolio faster than stocks if you don't manage the risks. Managing the risks lowers the returns. It is a catch 22.", "score": 28, "replies": [{"body": "Your first point is not entirely true, for exactly this case. If the underlying goes far underwater, you have less per share risk with options than stocks. The 2 year DTE ATM LEAP on Microsoft costs $4063 per contract. If you bought 100 shares of msft ($24161) instead and it loses more than 17% of its value, you lose more money in absolute terms than if you bought one contract at at a 240 strike. Yes, the option expires with 100% loss, but it cost you a lot less to purchase it. There are shrewd ways to use options that aren't just putting all your cash into them.", "score": 29, "replies": [{"body": "You are correct. In my example, I intended for the person to be all in on stocks or all in on leaps. If you have 24k you either buy all leaps or all stocks. In your example you would have 100 shares of msft or 6 options contracts. \n\nIf the stick loses 17% of its value then you either have 0 dollars if you are all in on leaps or you have 18.5k if you were all in on stocks. If MSFT goes up 17% then stocks gets you to 28080 and leaps gets you to about break even. If it goes up 34% then stocks gets you to 32k and leaps gets you to 24k. If it goes up 51% then stock gets you to 36k and leaps get you to 48k. \n\nGreater risk, greater reward. If the stock goes \"sideways\" and doesn't gain by more than 34% in 2 years then you lose. It is definitely more intricate than that on some level but that is the simplified version. If you look at it from making the market you would say the market maker expects the stock to rise by 34% over the next 2 years because that is what they set breakeven at for the leap. If you are very bullish on Microsoft you buy the leap. If you are less bullish then you buy the stock. \n\nIn your example of 100 shares vs 1 contract you actually will never have greater gains with the contract than the shares as you have to cover your premium before you start to bring in profit. So you limit upside but you also limit downside because if the stock goes down 50% you lose 4k instead of 12k.

If you were only able to do it 3 times while owning the stock you end up with just over 10% return on capital including the dividends.

The point is the same, the capital needed on low IV dividend stocks, in many cases, can be more capital efficient than holding the underlying and selling CCs.\n\nIf you want apples to apples for capital used, walk through the same exercise and hold 4x PMCC to 100 shares in this case.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Go get it Teebob!\n\nIt's all about risk management, of course when you trade with retirement account, stakes are higher", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "why not just buy LEAPs and do PMCC on them?", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "If the stock goes on a rip say goodbye to your gains.", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "Wouldn’t this be the case doing any sort of CCs, PM or otherwise?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Yes, that's why CC's are usually dumb if you have stock picking ability, or are in an easy money environment.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "They have gone ballistic multiple times", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Exactly what i was thinking", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "PMCC?

SK        Innovation has denied the allegations.     \n\nThe commission's ruling threatens two new battery plants SKI is building        in Georgia to        supply Ford and VW        with batteries for models set to go into production in the next two        years. The Korean company has said it is investing $2.6 billion        on the project.     \n\nThe ruling also complicates efforts by the Biden administration to        supercharge domestic battery and electric vehicle construction.        Wednesday's ruling starts the clock on a 60-day review period for the White        House. Changes to the commission's rulings are rare but not        without precedent.     \n\nIf the White House declines to intervene, then SKI can appeal        the matter in federal court. Construction on the site will proceed, a        company spokesman said.     \n\nIn the ruling, the commission prohibited SKI from importing its        batteries for 10 years. However, the ruling allowed the company to        import equipment necessary to make batteries for Ford        and VW for four and        two years, respectively, to allow the auto makers time to find another        domestic battery supplier.     \n\nSKI said it has serious concerns about the commercial and operational        implications of the decision for the future of its facility and will        begin discussions with Ford        and VW. The company        also looks forward to engaging the Biden administration on the issue, it        said.     \n\nLG Chem said it was grateful to the International Trade        Commission for its decision.     \n\nBoth Ford and VW        told the commission last year that without the new factories, they'll        have to delay their electric-vehicle plans because the batteries are        uniquely built for the new models and there isn't enough U.S.        capacity otherwise to fulfill the companies' needs.     \n\nThe SKI complex is expected to supply batteries for a new plug-in        version of Ford's        bestselling F-150 pickup truck. Volkswagen planned to use the        SKI-built batteries for a new crossover, called the ID.4, which will go        on sale in the U.S.        and be among the first to use VW's        latest battery-electric technology.     \n\nA Ford spokeswoman said the        decision supports the company's plans to bring the F-150 to market in        2022, but she declined to comment further. VW        said it was analyzing the ruling and remained committed to starting U.S.        electric vehicle production in 2022.     \n\nThe legal clash between two of the world's largest battery makers        highlights the difficulties auto makers face in securing a steady supply        of batteries necessary to meet their growth targets in electric        vehicles. With tightening auto- emissions regulations and some parts of        the world moving to phase out gasoline-powered cars altogether, the        global auto industry is under pressure to sell more battery-powered        vehicles in the coming years or risk having to pay steep fines.     \n\nAuto makers are pouring billions into electrifying their lineups.        However, their plans depend in part on expanding battery production,        which executives and analysts say may fall short of the numbers needed        to power the growing numbers of electric vehicles they expect to be sold.     \n\nSome car companies are getting increasingly involved with making the        batteries themselves to lock in supplies, while others are leaning more        on traditional battery makers like SKI and LG        Chem to supply their models.     \n\nChina dominates the current battery-supply chain, and        building a domestic capacity has become a core policy goal for U.S.        and European governments and investors.     \n\nJennifer Granholm, President Biden's nominee        to run the Energy Department, highlighted during a        Congressional hearing on her nomination last month her intention to        build a domestic-battery industry. \"We can buy electric car batteries        from Asia, or we        can make them in America,\" Ms. Granholm said.     \n\nThe commission was required by statute to consider how its decision        would affect U.S.        consumers.     \n\nAfter the earlier judge's ruling in 2019, lawyers for Ford,        Volkswagen and some of their suppliers filed briefs appealing        for the commission to avoid sanctions that would prevent SKI from        fulfilling its agreements to supply the auto makers with batteries.     \n\nVW described the potential for a \"catastrophic supply disruption\"        that would harm its employees, suppliers and dealers, slow consumer        uptake of electric cars and hinder the growing U.S.        battery industry.     \n\nFord said an adverse ruling would \"drastically reduce already        limited \\[electric vehicle\\] battery supply\" while disadvantaging U.S.        auto makers in competing with more mature battery manufacturing regions        in Europe and Asia.     \n\nBoth models are expected to go into production in 2022: Ford        in Michigan,        and Volkswagen in Tennessee.     \n\nIn 2019 SK Innovation        broke ground in Georgia        on its new battery-making complex that includes two plants and would        employ around 2,600 workers by 2024 at full capacity. If it comes        online, the facility is expected to produce enough batteries for more        than 300,000 electric vehicles annually, the company has said.     \n\nBut shortly after construction began, LG        Chem filed a complaint with the commission, alleging SKI had        misappropriated trade secrets through a campaign of poaching LG        employees. The complaint asked the commission to block the import of        batteries that use technology at the heart of the trade-secret dispute        and the materials or equipment necessary to manufacture them. Such a        move would effectively prevent production at the Georgia        plants from coming online.     \n\nA year ago, the judge overseeing the case issued a default judgment in        LG's favor after finding SKI in contempt and saying it destroyed        documents that may have been relevant to the case. SKI admitted in        filings that some documents had been destroyed but said that South        Korean law doesn't require the same efforts to preserve evidence that U.S.        courts do.     \n\nPresidents have chosen to override the trade commission on occasion.     \n\nIn 2013, the Obama administration overruled an ITC decision that would        have banned Apple Inc. from importing certain iPhones and iPads after        finding they infringed on a patent held by Samsung Electronics Co. The        administration cited concerns about potential harm to consumers and        competitive conditions in the U.S.        among the reasons for its decision.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Feel like you're playing this wrong.

These patterns, or tendencies, happen often enough for professional day traders to base their trading around them.\n\n9:30am: The stock market opens, and there is an initial push in one direction. Highly volatile!\n\n9:45am: The initial push often sees a significant reversal or pullback. This is often just a short-term shift, and then the original trending direction re-asserts itself.\n\n10:00am: If the trend that began at 9:30am is still happening, it will often be challenged around this time. This tends to be another time where there is a significant reversal or pullback.\n\n11:15am-11:30am: The market is heading into lunch hour, and London is getting ready to close. This is when volatility will typically die out for a few hours, but often the daily high or low will be tested around this time. European traders will usually close out positions or accumulate a position before they finish for the day. Whether the highs or lows are tested or not, the markets tend to ‘drift’ for the next hour or more.\n\n11:45am-1:30pm: This is lunch time in New York, plus a bit of a time buffer. Usually, this is the quietest time of the day, and often, day traders like to avoid it.\n\n1:30pm-2:00pm: If the lunch hour was calm, then expect a breakout of the range established during lunch hour. Often, the market will try to move in the direction it was trading in before the lunch hour doldrums set in.\n\n2:00pm-2:45pm: The close is getting closer, and many traders are trading with the trend thinking it will continue into close. That may happen, but expect some sharp reversals around this time, because on the flip side, man traders are quicker to take profits or move their trailing stop losses closer to the current price.\n\n\\---\n\n3:00pm-3:30pm: These are big “Shake-out” points, in that they will force many traders out of their positions. If a reversal of the prior trend occurs around this time, then the price is likely to move very strongly in the opposite direction. Even if the prior trend does sustain itself through these periods, expect some quick and sizable counter-trend moves.\n\nAs a day trader, its best to be nimble and not get tied into one position or direction. Many traders only trade the first hour and the last hour of every day, as these times are the most volatile.\n\n3:30pm-4:00pm: The market closes at 4pm. After that, the liquidity dries up in nearly all stocks and ETFs, except for the very active ones. It’s common to close all positions a minute or more before the closing bell, unless you have orders placed to close your position on a closing auction or “cross”.\n\nTrade Entry Checklist - Things to Consider before entering a trade\n\n1. Portfolio fit – Make sure you diversify your portfolio. If you have 9 open bullish positions, consider a bearish stance elsewhere to balance your portfolio and reduce risk.\n2. Liquidity Check – If the stock you are considering has enough stocks traded per day. This can easily be found on Yahoo! Finance – look for “Average Volume.” Look for contract strikes that have at least 1,000 contracts of open interest – this minimizes bid/ask spread and ensures market liquidity so that you can actually enter/exit trades easily.\n3. IV Percentile – Example: AAPL has IV of 45%, but IV percentile of 85%. This means that 85% of the time over the last year, volatility will be lower than it is right now as it’s current actual IV (45%). Likewise, if GOOG has an IV of 45% but an IV rank of 25%, then only 25% of the time over the last year IV was lower than it’s current value (45%). This means we have a 75% chance that IV will increase on average, meaning it’s current volatility is low – and we want to buy into that. If IV is between 70%-100% you will need to actively monitor that trade, higher risk.\n4. Options strategy - Pretty straight forward- If IV is high and the price of the underlying is also high, we can eliminate bullish strategies and focus on bearish, and vice versa.\n5. Strike Price – First you need to determine if you want an in the money (ITM) or out of the money (OTM). An ITM option has a greater sensitivity – delta – to the price of the underlying stock. So if the stock price increases by a given amount, the ITM call would gain more than an ATM or OTM call. This also means it would decline more than others if the price falls. ITM calls are more expensive as well – higher intrinsic value.\n\nNext consideration is risk/reward. An ITM option carrier less risk, but costs more. If you only want to stake a small amount of capital in a trade, an OTM position may be your best choice. OTM positions are riskier, cheaper, and potentially much more profitable if the stock surges past your strike price.\n\n6. Expiration – Date similarly to strike price, the further out a contracts expiration is, the higher the premium because time is on your side. There is a higher chance of the stock meeting your OTM target price given a year to do so, compared to a week. This is called Theta – a quantification of how much value is lost due to the passing of time. Theta also grows exponentially as you near the expiration date – your $190 strike call will be worth very little if the call expires tomorrow and the stock is at $180 because the probability of the stock reaching $190 is low.\n\n7. Position size – This is important – BIG TRADING POSITIONS WILL EXPONENTIALLY INCREASE YOUR RISK OF BLOWING UP YOUR ACCOUNT. We suggest you place trades utilizing only 1-5% of your total account value, with an emphasis on the lower end. Play it safe, round down. It’s much easier to recover from a -5% loss than -80%.\n\n8. Future moves – Think beyond what’s going on with a stock than just in the current day – unless youre scalping. Is there an earnings report coming up? Can I roll this into the next month if I need to? Is there an upcoming dividend payout? Take the time to plan your positions and don’t rush your entry – You want to ensure the best possibility of success. I’d take $500 profit with a 90% success rate over $750 profit with a 50% success rate any day.

I also have had a lot of vaccines... \n\nYou are unlikely to find much value in $0.10 options. You are also unlikely to find good value at $1 stocks. The reason, stocks less than a dollar run the risk of delisting from major exchanges, which is not bueno. Don't spend your time kicking around stocks just because they are cheap.

And it gets more complicated from there. For instance, you can shift the risk/reward so it pays off if the stock moves more than a certain amount in either direction, and only lose money if it moves less than that amount. You can change it so your losses are fixed... you lose if the stock moves against you at all, but the amount you lose doesn't depend on how far against you it moves.  There's a million variations.  \n\n\nBut if you don't have a pretty good idea of where the stock is going, options aren't going to help you, because you can't change the *overall* risk/reward to make it more favorable to you overall. You can only change it to make the risk/reward more or less favorable within certain pre-selected price ranges, and if you're wrong, the loss is going to be proportionally higher, because you can't eliminate risk, you can only move it out of the way to where you think the price won't be.  \n\n\nI think the easiest way to understand it is to look up \"beginner options strategies\" on Google, and look at some graphs that show you how the different options change the risk/reward of a trade compared to just buying the stock. I actually downloaded an option grapher into Excel (google *corporate finance institute option graph excel*) and played with it for hours, that helped a lot.   \n\n\nThe only other thing worth saying is, options differ from buy & hold in that it only matters where the price is by a certain date. If you usually trade with stoplosses, and the price dips below your stoploss, you lose the trade. With options, *sometimes*, it's se up so your only possible loss is the money you paid upfront for the option, so you don't need stoplosses after that, either it's worth something by expiration or it's not, and no other movements matter, even if it temporarily dropped to zero the meantime. Geneally, this costs you some profits, but as someone who gets stopped out of a lot of trades at the bottom only to watch price immediately recover, I see the appeal in this.   \n\n\nWhew, didn't mean to write a novel.

It’s a trap to continue investing in your losing positions. If you’re a bagholder, the way out is not to funnel more funds into a sinking stock, averaging down. The better strategy is to invest in other stocks with clear upward momentum and trends. Use gains to offset your losses. Diversify your portfolio for better results.\n\nIt sucks being a bag holder. I know the feeling. I owned CCL for the dividend before Covid. Then the pandemic crushed the cruise lines and my position. Suddenly I was down 70% on the stock. But I did not invest another dollar into CCL since the health crisis began. Instead of averaging down, I put that money to better use in stocks that could benefit from the pandemic and economic recovery. Subsequently, I’ve enjoyed an incredible past year, making a ton of money while leaving my CCL loss in the rearview mirror. \n\nThrowing good money after bad is a self-defeating move. Remember: the point of investing is to *make money* — not gradually lose more and more of it in a position that’s clearly shrinking in value. Invest in winners, not losers.\n\nThis is not professional financial advice. Do what you will, of course. I just hate seeing newer folks lose money when they don't have to.

{"title": "AMKR - Amkor Technology - A Great Play in the Semi Conductor Space - CRIMINALLY Undervalued, literally can't go tits up!", "selftext": "EDIT: So we are are almost up over 10% since I wrote this DD. Steady 3-4% both days. That is what we need, slowly ride this baby to to the moon\n\nBeen a member for about a year and seen some great DD, so about time I do one of my own. It might be a bit long, so a summary upfront:\n\n**AMKR – Amkor Technology** \\- is an undervalued stock in the semi-conductor space, which is going to be a super-hot sector in 2021 and beyond. The stock has great financials and the P/E ratio is killer, even better than any of your established boomer stocks.  The company has a market cap of 5B on revenues of $5B\n\nThis is not a get rich quick scheme or a pump and dump. Invest wisely and this one should rise gradually during the year.\n\nPosition – 16c , 3/19 and 24c 3/19 and 2k shares. I got into the stocks couple of weeks back when it was at $16\n\nNow that is out of the way, lets get to it.\n\n**What do you look for in a great DD:**\n\n1. Company is in a growing space that is hot at the moment\n2. Financials are solid\n3. Outlook is great\n4. Company is a bit of an unknown and undervalued\n5. There is an upcoming catalyst\n\nBefore I get into each, let me simply tell you what AMKR does. The company provides testing and packaging services to semi-conductor companies. So it works with companies that need to develop chips for your 5G phones, for your future EV Lambos. Basically it provides critical services to companies that manufacture or deal in semi conductors. The company is based in the USA and has big players like Qualcomm, Sony, AMD etc as its customers.\n\nSo now lets get to it:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. ***Company is in a growing space that is hot at the moment.***\n\nUnless you have been hiding under the rock, semi-conductors are hot at the moment. There are multiple catalysts, from 5G phones roll out, to the EV wave, to more cloud computing, everything needs processing power. This means more demand for semi-conductors, in fact there is already a significant shortage being seen across the board. This is a hot sector to be in the moment. Don’t believe me here you go:\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/10/whats-causing-the-chip-shortage-affecting-ps5-cars-and-more.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/10/whats-causing-the-chip-shortage-affecting-ps5-cars-and-more.html)\n\n[https://www.ft.com/content/6caf7028-cae1-44f3-9bc2-7dc2d47a23ef](https://www.ft.com/content/6caf7028-cae1-44f3-9bc2-7dc2d47a23ef)\n\nEverything in this sector is running at full capacity. More production means more testing and packaging and this shit is not going to slow down anytime soon.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***2.*** ***Financials are solid***\n\nI can more with you all the details in the world, on how the company is constantly reducing it’s debt and increasing operating income or how it recently announced it is going to start giving dividends, but I am going to focus on one metric. P/E ratio.\n\nWhile I was typing up this DD the P/E ratio of this company is 15.91. So is that good or bad, well to put it in context, Apple is 36.57 and Microsoft is is 36.35. Even your boomer stock PepsiCo is at 26.7.\n\nOkay, but what about other companies in this space. TSM the biggest player in this space is at 62.17. Another favourite of this reddit, UMC 78.63, QCOM 24.81. AMAT, probably the closest to their business 28.79\n\nLike I said, that metric alone tell you how criminally undervalued this company is.  Even a P/E ratio of 25, which would put it in the low end of the range, would shoot its price past $30\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***3. Outlook is great:***\n\nWell, I am not going to say much, but just copy paste the closing statement from the last earnings call:\n\n“Okay. Well, thank you very much. Before closing the call, I would like to recap a few key messages. 2020 was a remarkable year for Amkor. We generated over $5 billion in revenue and $1.40 per share, and initiate cash dividend program for our stockholders. We accomplished this while navigating through a challenging global pandemic. We are expecting the first quarter of 2021 to be another solid quarter with revenue of $1.32 billion at the mid-point of our guidance.\n\n2021 is expected to be another growth year for Amkor. Semiconductor market forecasts predict growth of around 9% for the year. With Amkor’s position in key growth markets, we expect to outgrow the semi-market forecast in 2021”\n\nUMC has a revenue of $5bn and a valuation of $25B which is 4X of this company!AMAT as 3.5 times the revenue and 20X the valuation\n\nAlso to recap their 2020 highlights\n\nFull Year 2020 Highlights:\n\nNet sales $5.05 billion, up 24.6% year on yearNet income $338 million, earnings per diluted share $1.40EBITDA $960 millionNet cash from operations $770 million and free cash flow $221 million\n\nSixth consecutive year of positive free cash flow\n\nFinancial information on the company:\n\n[https://ir.amkor.com/static-files/4052c2a2-2944-4563-88b2-6a6c928ae302](https://ir.amkor.com/static-files/4052c2a2-2944-4563-88b2-6a6c928ae302)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***4. Company is bit of an unknown and undervalued***\n\nI mean, come on, everyone talks about TSM, AMAT, UMC, but has anyone every mentioned this company? It is literally the definition of an unknown.\n\nUndervalued, it is CRIMINALLY undervalued compared to it peers. Look at the P/E ratio, literally better than anyone else. Its revenue to valuation ratio, literally better than anyone else. I mean I don’t know what else to say. This speaks BUY BUY BUY!\n\nI mean, this company should have a valuation of at least $10B, which would shoot its price past $40\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*5.* ***There is upcoming catalyst***\n\nWell company just become a strong buy on Zacks, but there is a bigger catalyst coming up on Feb 16th, which is the reason for some price action today:\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amkor-technology-set-join-p-232600920.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amkor-technology-set-join-p-232600920.html)\n\n**The company is going to join the S&P Mid Cap 400 on Feb 16th.** This is probably the reason why the stock moved so much today.\n\nThis alone will bring more capital into the company. More and more people will look into this company and realize the absurd valuation compared to its peers and yes this rill rise more. Today was just the start of what might happen over the next week\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR:**\n\nYes I know the stock has doubled in the last 6 months and jumped 20% today, but\n\n1. The outlook is better than ever in company’s history\n2. They delivered their best ever quarter and will even pay dividends\n3. The financial ratios are best in class, even better than all your boomer stocks\n4. Based on the revenue and ratios alone the company should be valued at least 2X what it is today\n5. Company is in the super hot semi-conductor space\n6. There is an upcoming catalyst on Feb 16th - S&P 400 Mid-Cap inclusion\n7. Another stock being mentioned here ON has the same revenue and income and is valued 3X more. if you think that is  a great play, which it is, think about this one!\n8. The volume is lowish, but again I see that as a positive as this will climb quickly once there is interest. The avg volume on this stock is 1M, it was 5M today and already 700k after hours\n\nI am balls deep on 24c, 3/19, which was looking risky two days ago, but it looks juicy as fuck now.\n\nAs always do your DD, and enjoy the tendies!\n\nI am no financial advisor, but some guy who thinks we all can make money from this GEM\n\n🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀", "id": "lhv717", "created_utc": 1613078695.0, "score": 181, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 180, "comments": [{"body": "I think every DD should come with a counterargument as to why the stock will fail.

Per the lawsuit filed Nov 22, 2019 in North Carolina, Herza says they had the idea to build a portable diagnostic machine that would use cellphone tech and could be used in a vet's office. They contracted another company, 'Rapid Diagnostek', to design and build a machine to their specifications. After five years of development and $500,000 invested, Rapid Diagnostek suddenly went belly-upfolded without notice. Comes Qorvo and they buy Rapid Diagnostic's assets in bankruptcy including it seems a nearly complete design for a diagnostic machine which coincidentally looks almost exactly like the one Herza designed and for which they retained, and still retain, exclusive rights to their patents.

I am not a lawyer and legalese makes no fucking sense to me)\n* In the suit above, Heska claims that they had two contracts with Rapid Diagnostek to do some shit for Heska, but then Rapid Diagnostek went tits up. Qorvo buys Rapid Diagnostek and Heska sues Rapid Diagnostek for breach of contract.\n\nWho knows maybe this takes off but this doesn't seem like a slam dunk.

{"title": "I think PLTR is invincible rn and in the long run.", "selftext": "So... this could be a bit long, but let me double down  on my thoughts on PLTR. Recently, we’ve seen a little turmoil in the broader market that has scared some growth investors, and I do think there is some justifiable fear.\n\nA lot of folks are going to tell you this is a great discount on names like TSLA or PLUG, and I certainly don’t disagree with them- I just want to have all my bases covered.\n\nNow we have seen some structural shifts in the broader market. The 10-Year shift up to 1.35% is a noticable tick up, and this is something all of us 🦍 have to be wary of.\n\nAs much as I like discounts, when the market prices in tighter money, the Fed will have to listen. I believe Uncle Jay will continue to have the market’s back, and I think the 10-Year should be capped at roughly 1.5-2%. We’ll see how this develops, but the bottomline is these forward-looking growth giants are going to get CRUSHED if they miss expectations.\n\nAnd well, if technology continues to be a deflationary pressure through innovation as we all expect, then 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 regardless and we can cap the discussion here.\n\nSo here’s where sweet good PLTR comes into play. I really, really like how they delivered earnings last week. Didn’t REALLY disappoint: beat earnings on a non-GAAP basis and had 45% annual top line growth.\n\nBut that’s not even the kicker for me. The fact that PLTR leadership is essentially guaranteeing at least 30% growth over the next 5 years (read the earnings call transcript), which will look like an absolute bonanza if rates actually start to go up.\n\nNow, the thesis is that growth firms’ future profits are less valuable today if rates start to go up, which would not be great for big growth names like PLTR. But then here’s the thing: it would absolutely WRECK mega tech growth like FAANG or the EV/battery state field.\n\nLet’s go back to earnings. Karp and the PLTR team are essentially setting the bar very low, telling investors to sit back and expect ONLY 30% growth for 5+ years. (For boomers, they realize this is fucking crazy btw).\n\nEssentially, if there is any surprise to the upside, which is totally reasonable with a disruptor like Palantir, and this thing will be worth hundreds of billions in the blink of an eye.\n\nBut think of how all these great stories came about. Tesla in 2017-2019. Facebook in 2012-2013. Apple in 2008-2009. These tech stars never had a straight shot up, and the same goes for PLTR.\n\nThey faced the same problems. I’m only a college student, but I remember for as long as I have been alive from skeptical financial analysts that Tesla was gargantually overvalued and didn’t have the cash to survive in the EV market.\n\nI watched as a kid as some whiz built up a social media platform from his dorm room, but Wall St attacked him for wearing a hoodie to his IPO. Not only did they not think he could expand his platform from PC to mobile, but they questioned how its cutting edge technology differed from Myspace and Tumblr, and wondered if he could ever scale ad revenue. \nHe shore could.\n\nYes, PLTR is overvalued. What isn’t? Snowflake trades for 80X estimated sales. C3.AI trades at 73.5X its 2020 revenues. Salesforce, Splunk, and MSFT ain’t cheap. \n\n(For reference, PLTR is trading just under 37X 2021 sales, which is lofty, but looks reasonable compared to these other names that have way higher multiples and much less sophisticated/scalable software).\n\nAnd if we look at it... PLTR was profitable by roughly $0.06/share if you take out a stockholder compensation expense that otherwise would have left them with $100M+ in operating profit. \n\nIs it profitable? PLTR has 70% fucking margins. How are Finance pricks not creaming over this??? You want high margin/earnings- this is it right here, man.\n\nBut no, no, big bad overvalued Palantir want to pay executives/advisors/shareholders extra money. Bad. Bad- I say they worth $20 in equity research reports and on CNBC instead, but still load up behind the scenes 🤮🤡.\n\nFuck the shills who say Palantir can’t continue robust growth or be profitable. (I am looking at your trend-seeking bots Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley).\n\nOn top of that, yes their revenue base is dominated by gov’t clients at roughly 52%, but let’s pause and realize this is a good thing. I mean... i don’t want to get too political here, but broadly, you’re a fool if you think the Dod, DoJ, or CDC/NIAID are cutting back anytime soon, if not looking to HEAVILY EXPAND given the monumental threats we face- geopolitical foes like China, Russia Iran; climate change; police reform; EV adoption/renewables more broadly; 5G and cloud/quantum computing, i really could keep going (amongst all of them, these agencies have dozens of contracts with PLTR worth hundreds of millions of $).\n\nNot too mention PLTR also has massive contracts with numerous EU members and Asian allies like Japan/S. korea, but there’s honestly so many positive examples about how scalable this beauty is both domestically and internationally.\n\nAnd let’s take what Cathie Wood said the other day on CNBC: roughly along the lines that some of the greatest innovations come from the military. I think we can point to the WWW as a pretty decent example of that.\n\nGiven PLTR traces its roots to the CIA’s venture capital arm and loading up on national security contracts with all the intelligence agencies after 9/11, I feel pretty confident that this lengthy history will continue providing much value in revenue AND earnings to PLTR, especially if rates starts to rise.\n\nFurthermore, the cross that bogged Tesla, Apple, FB, and pretty much every mega cap tech company is restraining Palantir right now. The Street wonders if they will be able to continue locking down corporate clients, which it has been rapidly expanding in recent years.\n\nThe answer is yes. But Wall St doesn’t want you to think so at the moment. B/c PLTR was a direct listing, they weren’t underwritten by investment banks, and thus don’t receive the same financial shilling that names like Snowflake or C3.AI LITERALLY PAY FEES TO analysts/associates at bulge bracket banks to shill like a damn used ‘98 Honda Accord (and that’s exactly what these other SAaS names are compared to PLTR)\n\nBut we always double down on our convictions. If you have seen Palantir’s demos, read its financials, or listened to their CEO, then you know the potential of this company.\n\nI believe in people. I believe in Peter Thiel and his track record. I believe a guy who founded PayPal with Elon Musk, seeded Facebook when no one else would, and decided to seed PLTR w/ the CIA (when no one else would)- yes, I believe he knows what he is doing.\n\nAnd I believe he is capable of finding talent like Alex Karp and collaborating with him to build an absolute behemoth.\n\nAs a conclusion, can someone give me a firm answer on a company that can actually compete with PLTR in terms of solving a complex issue like tracking down Osama Bin Laden or expanding a niche industry into international markets??? And if your only comment is on valuations, see Snowflake (quite the value investment Mr. Buffett ;).\n\nFor disclosure, I am very long PLTR and am simply sharing my thoughts. This is not financial advice. And as always, do your own reading/research, but these are the frank sentiments of a PLTR believer.\n\nNow with the lock-up fucking history, PLTR TO THE MOON 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀\n\n**UPDATED PART 2: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lr1l80/pltr_extensive_dd_part_2_what_makes_it/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf", "id": "lq8rw4", "created_utc": 1614053305.0, "score": 659, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 188, "comments": [{"body": "As soon as jim cramers starts telling people to move from Plantir, I know it's time to buy in.\n\n6600 shares @ $28.14", "score": 227, "replies": [{"body": "Jim Cramer is such a broken record.

Hospitals, Logistics, Manufacturing, Pharmacies, etc. across the supply chain are the data partners.  \n\nThe Federal Government stepped in to create Tiberius using Foundry and probably a heavy dose of extra customization thrown in for “free” think of the health care supply chain experience pltr  is absorbing right now going to be great for commercial future.\n\nNow,  Palantir spent its early years with government interconnecting old systems.  Lots of the Manufacturing, Logistics, and Health Care systems still to this day use old systems on the back end.  They are large organizations who have applications written on old code and getting the data out in real time and writing it back to those systems (a recent feature rolled out to existing foundry customers) is a whole ball of wax in of itself.  all the ml/ai, big data, crm, or any other way you explore manipulate view delete copy replace that data is all secondary to this “plumbing” problem\n\nOn top of that Palantir’s foundational code (which is the bines of both gotham and foundry) is designed to solve the problem of authorized access to this data.  A field operative, an intel analyst, a 1 star general, and a liason from a completely different branch or agency all need different access to different interconnected intel on a situation right?  so that the other side of pltr\n\nso when you marry these two ideas of being able to read and write data from anywhere (private cloud, public cloud, private datacenter, colocated datacenters, the excel spreadsheet that marge from accounting leaves\non her desktop, publicly available statistic feeds like how many people registered at the dmv this year, the information from the on board computer of the drone buster Andruil (Lucky Palmer ex-oculus founder’s new start-up with a few ex-FDEs) and add the ability to ensure government (il-5 soon to be the only company rated with il6) trusted levels of access and authentication as if every piece of data was a national top secret clearance file you get those base bones that make up Gotham and Foundry\n\nSince this has turned into a wsb style DD post at this point ill just continue and hope i make it to a point on your original question.\n\nright so Palantir built Tiberius problem is (and I would rather not get political but to be fair I cant vote for president currently and I dont live on mainland US currently so I guess you might call that objective of at least certain biases I have lived the entirety of my adult life in Puerto Rico so I dont have much love for either party only preference on policy, ethics, and morality insert grain of salt if you want)\n\nTrump wasnt exactly interested in getting involved in State level issues,  he had opinions on them and used his off hands approach as a way to scape goat members of his own party and anyone else.  \n\nPalantir can only do what they are asked and contracted for.  My purely keyboard quarterback opinion is this prevented any possibility of smooth roll out of the vaccine when it was ready.  Sure the manufacturers, scientists, and other non state entities involved up until the moment of the vaccine (probably many of those were more modernized systems) were easy to do the plumbing on for palnantir and relatively few end points but if Palantir was only given the nod to do work at the state federal interconnect level and below then none of that matters now.  \n\nMany States and Many Health Care systems have to begin to feed the system directly from the source for the system to work as it should..\n\nThe reports that came out a few weeks ago indicated that the early experience was issues getting the data from states pushed into the system and getting the information pushed back down.  A single bottleneck was unnecessarily created where from that point down the line communications was not plumbed.\n\nI think Palantir was setup to be thrown under the bus in this situation and public perception of what they do (when all they really do is sell the shovel to the government and other industries that have similar needs) feeds right into this idea that an FDE would be making any kind of decision on what to do with the data especially after the whole Cambridge Analytica scandal.  the threat of scandal  will forever be Palantir’s largest cross to bear.  That is the price of working so tightly with governments, well that and all the R&D money they will blow in ways we as investors will have no vision into.\n\nCramer said around DPO days Palantir wont run in price because they do “secret stuff” with the Government and I think he is both right and wrong.  We wont know they why or even the when will this project stop on the R&D side but the Intellectual Property and experience on the other side of it is massive.\n\nfuck it im done for now.  hope that clears it up shoot me back any follow ups and i promise i wont act like an ass or a prick\n\nedit: some quick sentence fixes i hate typing large walls of text on mobile \n\nalso remember Palantir has been at it for 18 years.  Dems and Rep have signed contracts with them and allowed them to grow into their role.  Each Administration and more importantly agency or branch has their own agendas and their way of view the world.  Palantir is just a tool for them to achieve it.  So what I guess Im saying is remember to vote and trust your democratic system works well enough to be the custodian of such power.

{"title": "“The real moon play”: Multi-faceted infinite squeeze cycle", "selftext": "Revised:\nI think I get it now. It’s not one or the other squeeze. It’s all of them together, driving each other. \n\nCongress just had them testify about round 1 but they don’t even know round two is gonna bigger. They turned the issue into even more discussed worldwide news. That may not be the “catalyst” but it is aerosolized fuel in an enclosed space ready for a spark. \n\nThe Armageddon, only statistically possible but completely unimaginable, scenario we’re heading towards. We all know the shorts exceed the number of available shares and the original SHORT SQUEEZE thesis. But now we have the GAMMA SQUEEZE taking part. Retail figured out how to counter synthetic shorts by forcing institutions to honor call options. Every call option that has been written and is in the money MUST purchase shares in the open market even though THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH SHARES IN EXISTENCE TO DO THAT. And not just the shares in the market. This would mean the entire share count held by hedges and clearing houses being transferred to retail and etf ownership through options being exercised. \n\nRetail countered the naked shorting in way that not only negates it but exponentially increases the squeeze process. \n\nIt’ll be like using a market order to cover a short squeeze, gobbling up any share no matter the cost(remember the 5k snipe orders last time?), except at a market wide level- the entire float PLUS forced shares bought for ITM contracts. \n\nHow much can something cost when it doesn’t exist but HAS to be bought?\nThe ultimate lesson in supply and demand. \n\nIt’ll be like taking the strength of pliers and adding a hydraulic press. \n\nWe were all looking at it like round one. Over extended hedgie shorts vs retail holders forcing a cover. But the dynamic has evolved to a MULTI FACETED INFINITE SQUEEZE CYCLE.\nThis is “the moon” play. This makes that AI suggestion of 130k a share make sense. I’m not saying the AI is right necessarily in terms of price. I am saying it’s gonna take a deeper look at what happens when institutions owe more than they can’t deliver, and resulting price movement further exacerbates the original step. The machine takes information and EXTRAPOLATES. \n\nIt went to 5k when it was retail using available shares to force shorts to cover. How multiplied can it get when that happens again while institutions are forced to buy 100 share lots for contracts? \nThere won’t be enough open shares on the market. They’ll have to sell their own to the option holders just to honor them. They’ll have to buy more from other brokers and clearing houses having the same problem. \n\nAnd all of this is compounded even further, because the higher this drives the stock the more option contracts are ITM, more forced buying and giving their own shares , more squeezes, more contracts ITM repeat repeat repeat repeat.\n\nThat’s the important part. Not just the squeezes. The “cycle”. Because it’s self perpetuating past a certain point, like a dying star reaching the critical mass it takes to become a black hole. \nI saw someone even mention that once and I didn’t understand but they were right. \n\nIt would literally crash the stock market and effect all foreign markets involved. An upwards crash that sucks all capital from the largest players. \n\nI see people mentioning “rational thought” or “rational behavior” of the stock. \nBut it’s not rational. Holding something beyond its suggest value breaks with the notion of rational value systems. It’s mass irrational behavior to cause extreme hyperbolic stock movement. I feel like hyperbolic is the right word over parabolic?\n\nYou know how when you buy a call it technically has the potential for unlimited gain because the stock can theoretically go up infinitely? This is exactly that situation being played out on a grand scale.\n\nI think it’s kind of amazing because this is the defining characteristic of using the the stock market instead of gold. It increases the amount of perceived wealth beyond the physical capabilities of the world. There’s not enough gold or precious metals to equal the world economy. It’s made up to represent something that can’t exist but is necessary to facilitate the notion of unlimited growth. And now that very same principle may be inadvertently used to either destroy the system or force an evolution of financial theory. \n\nThe entire point of this idea is that the mechanics are being broken by players refusing to acknowledge parameters. They learned to cheat the system back at us the first time. \nShorts are creating shorts of shorts. They don’t exist. They’re making unlimited shares to maintain their position. So buyers are gonna do the same thing, but purposely do it in an arena that can’t be expanded indefinitely. They can make up the shorts they borrow back and forth with each other(and through unknowing retail stock-lending program participants) but there are only so many real shares. They are inarguably finite by definition. \nCould they force a reverse split or  force dilution by issuing new shares against shareholders and the company’s will? I  don’t know. \n\nAll we have to do is hold. Hold on to your sense of wonder as the story plays out. \nHold to your courage. \n\nI’m not a financial advisor and don’t know what I’m talking about. I just like this stock and stories about the end of the world. \n\nI don’t even care about the money that much. I just want to take control of my own life. \nI can’t wait for us to read about this moment in history someday, and each think about what small parts we played and how we remember it. \n\nApes together strong", "id": "lst66i", "created_utc": 1614327491.0, "score": 845, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 182, "comments": [{"body": "Wife told me to sell.

They’d have to actually put up the total cost of buying the full price of every real share. On top of paying margin requirements on their own shorts and naked shorts(the fees of which just multiplied). It would also mean risking increasing the price against their own short borrowed positions and synthetic shorts pushing them further out of the money while pumping the gamma squeeze created by hundred of thousands of call options that would now be ITM. They have to close the entire play inside the 14 days they’re allowed to use the fake shares. So that has to be continually rolled over to maintain the downwards pressure. \nMaybe they spread the cost of the play through multiple hedge funds and pool resources. All members buy what real shares they can while lending real and naked shorts to each other. That doesn’t sound legal but I also just made it up thinking about how I’d do it.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "You have done an excellent job at wasting my time.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
