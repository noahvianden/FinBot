This is still way better than the spring and summer highs when I would see gas at Costco being sold for close to $6 per gallon, to say nothing of gas vendors like Mobil or Shell, which are always more expensive.

{"title": "PSA: GME stock dividend will not force shorts to cover", "selftext": "A stock dividend is treated differently than a cash dividend. When a cash dividend is paid on a stock, anyone who has a short position against those shares has to pay that dividend back to the holder they borrowed it from. This is because a cash dividend is real economic value that the lemder is entitled to.\n\nA stock dividend, however, does not require the shorts to do anything because it doesn't represent missed economic value from the lender's perspective. If I lent you one share of GME representing 1% equity ownership and it does a 4:1 stock dividend, you now owe me four shares conveying 0.25% ownership each. There's no economic value being accrued to the shares the lender owns, so there's nothing the short seller has to pay to make them whole. The short seller does not have to return the share to the lender then re-borrow the four shares. \n\n**Here's the most analogous example I could come up with**\n\nPretend you're renting a four-room house (represnting GME pre-stock dividend) from a landlord (representing the lender of the shorted shares). you only rented this house because you believe it will decline in value. Once your lease started, you secretly sold the house to some sucker who buys it because he wants to live there and is confident that the housing market is artificially depressed by fake houses listed on zillow in the area. He also heard rumors about a new law coming into effect soon which will expose this fraud. You're secretly planning to buy it back once the market value plummets, then terminate your lease. This isn't meant to be realistic so please don't nitpick at things like home ownership titles.\n\nCash dividend:  the landlord has a magical marijuana plant which requires no care yet yields exactly one ounce of mid-grade weed every quarter like clockwork. As a tenant, it's your contracted responsibility to mail him this weed every quarter. Once you sell the house, the new homeowner is legally entitled to the quarterly ounce of weed from this plant, so you cant mail your landlord his weed anymore. Instead, you buy identical mid-grade weed every quarter from a dealer and send that to him. Landlord is happy to be receiving the mid-grade weed he's entitled to, and can't tell the difference bc shitty mids is shitty mids.\n\nStock dividend: a pointless new law is announced: all four rooms within this house now have a different address, and represent four distinct properties. As a result, your lease is changed to four separate leases, each at 1/4 the monthly rent. Your total monthly rent hasn't changed, and your landlord's house hasn't either. In other words, your monthly rent has not changed, and you don't owe your landlord anything. You don't have to move out of his house at 11:59 pm on the last day of your old lease and then move back in 2 mins later when the new 4-room lease kicks in.\n\n**TLDR and TDDU (too dumb don't understand)** - If that's still too complicated for you apes. The dildo I use on your wife breaks down into four stackable pieces of increasing girths, like those Russian matreyshka dolls. If I lend you that dildo and It comes apart while you're thrusting it into your dumb ass and can't figure out how to put it back together, you now owe me the four pieces of my dildo that add up to the whole dildo I lent you. That's it. You don't have to return the 4 shit covered dildo components to me then re-borrow them.\n\nI look forward to seeing where the next goalpost is placed.", "id": "vt5j7f", "created_utc": 1657154998.0, "score": 49, "upvote_ratio": 0.61, "num_comments": 126, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|3|**First Seen In WSB**|8 months ago\n**Total Comments**|56|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|3 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=vt5j7f)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=vt5j7f)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 18, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "OP been real quiet since this‚Ä¶", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Honestly I skipped over his question at first because I had just answered about 20 questions in a row asking the same \"but what about the naked shorts?!\" \n\nThere aren't any naked shorts.", "score": -1, "replies": [{"body": "there‚Äôs the difference i suppose, a difference in speculation", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "you did NOT just come back 6 months later without even a remind me ü§£ hope you‚Äôre doing well.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "To answer your bolded question - nope. Let's pretend there actually a massive conspiracy to take down GME via fake shares (there isn't).\n\n\rA stock dividend is not passed through the short seller to the lender of shares, unlike a cash dividend. This is because the stock dividend increases the number of shares outstanding by 4x, while simultaneously decreasing the equity ownership conveyed per share by 1/4. Even if a bunch of GME short sellers were shorting fake shares (they're not), this still would not be a reason that they'd have to buy back shares to repay the lender. It's just not how this works.\n\nPretend you have a one dollar bill which is sitting on your desk and you had no plans to spend it. Pretend you lend me this dollar bill, and I agree to pay you interest while I'm borrowing it. If I take this dollar bill and convert it into four quarters, would you demand that I repay you three of those quarters? No, you wouldn't, because I still owe you a dollar. Also, making me return three of my four quarters would cost you money, because my future interest payments to you would be 75% less, and those 3 quarters would just sit on your desk doing nothing.\r  \n\r  \nThis is why this stock dividend is such a non-event. The stock pumped today because the market is speculating that a lower price per share will create an influx in overall retail investment dollars, because apes who couldn't afford the stock at $120 can now afford to contribute some capital which otherwise would have never found its way into GME's market cap.

{"title": "The US adds 372,000 jobs in June, and a robust labor market is considered as a safeguard against a recession.", "selftext": "**Unemployment rate stays at 3.6% in June**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2m6zx0198da91.jpg?width=700&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3a1c5b5dd3f2e013c626d3fd25452c525231d01d\n\n**The numbers:** The U.S. created a robust 372,000 new jobs in June, confounding predictions of a big slowdown in hiring and signaling the economy has some zip left despite growing talk of recession.\n\nEconomists polled by The Wall Street Journal had forecast 250,000 new jobs.\n\nThe unemployment rate was unchanged at 3.6%, the government said Friday, just a a tick above the pre-pandemic low.\n\nThe strong gains in employment this year are unlikely to last, however.\n\nFor one thing, the biggest shortage of labor in decades is unlikely to ease soon, making it hard for companies that still want to hire to do so.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is also sharply raising U.S. interest rates to try to reverse the worst outbreak of inflation in 40 years. Higher rates tend to slow the economy by making it more costly to buy a home or car or to take out a business loan.\n\nThe central bank wants to reduce the boiling-over labor market to a simmer. The labor crunch has boosted worker pay by the largest amount since the 1980s and helped families cope with rising prices, but it would be harder for the Fed to bring down inflation if rapid wage gains persist.\n\nHourly pay rose a solid 0.3% in June to $32.08, but wage growth is slowing. The increase in pay over the past year slipped again to 5.1% from 5.3% in the prior month and 5.6% in the early spring.\n\nIn a potentially bad omen, the size of the labor force fell for the second time in three months. The labor force tends to stagnate when hiring slows or jobs become harder to find.\n\nThe share of the working-age population 16 or older who either have jobs or are looking for one slipped to 62.2% from 62.3%, leaving it well below the pre-pandemic peak.\n\n**Big picture:** A smorgasbord of recent reports suggest the economy is slowing. It‚Äôs even possible the economy could shrink for the second quarter in a row ‚Äî the typical definition of a recession.\n\nYet while many economists believe a recession is increasingly likely in the next year, they also say the U.S. is in OK shape for now.\n\nConsumers are spending enough money to keep the wheels of the economy turning and businesses are still hiring and investing. Gasoline prices have also fallen recently and could give Americans temporary relief.\n\n**Key details:** The increase in hiring in June was broad based.\n\nProfessional employment rose by 74,000 to lead the way. Some tech companies are holding the line on new hires, but other white-collar firms are still adding jobs.\n\nBars, restaurants, hotels and other companies in the hospitality business created 67,000 new jobs, reflecting pentup demand among consumers to go out again as the pandemic loses its grip on the routines of daily life.\n\nEmployment also rose by 57,000 in health care, 36,000 in warehousing and transportation and 29,000 in manufacturing.\n\nThe private sector has now recovered all 21 million jobs it lost in the first two months of the pandemic. Employment rose to 129.8 million in June from 129.6 million in February 2020.\n\nThe only decline in jobs took place in government, and it was a small one at that.\n\n**Looking ahead:** ‚ÄúJune‚Äôs strong job growth, especially in the teeth of high inflation, shows that the expansion remains on solid ground,‚Äù said corporate economist Robert Frick of Navy Federal Credit Union.\n\n‚ÄúToday‚Äôs report will only embolden the Fed to hike rates by another 75 basis points later this month, which is why we expect the economy to stall and come close to recession at the turn of the year,‚Äù said senior economist Sal Guatieri at BMO Capital Markets.\n\n**Market reaction: The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, 0.21% and S&P 500 SPX, 0.24% fell slightly in Friday trades. Stocks lost ground after the better-than-expected jobs report on the view that it will force the Fed to aggressively raise interest rates.**\n\nSource: [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/coming-up-u-s-jobs-report-for-june-11657282206](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/coming-up-u-s-jobs-report-for-june-11657282206)", "id": "vudu03", "created_utc": 1657295397.0, "score": 169, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 127, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|32|**First Seen In WSB**|2 months ago\n**Total Comments**|74|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|2 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=vudu03)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=vudu03)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "So, Fed will continue to raise interest rates.", "score": 70, "replies": [{"body": "Correct.", "score": 19, "replies": [{"body": "\"oh god no not my free money i have to now pay for!\"   \n\\~ corporate chuds.", "score": 11, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "ELI5 how there is so much labor shortage with a 3.6 unemployment rate?", "score": 47, "replies": [{"body": "Use easy numbers:\n\nPre-pandemic theres 150 people in the US and 100 jobs and 100 people in the workforce\n\nOf those 100 people (in workforce), 97 are currently employed.

It‚Äôs making Americans lazy, fat, arrogant, and entitled. \n\nMy personal thought is that a lot of the mentality has shifted that way because of the fed printing money. There have been no consequences for capital mis-allocation in the last 25 some odd years. There are numbers out there on zombie corporations - they are at all time highs.

[link](https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/us-corporate-debt-hit-hard-inflation-shock-intensifies-economic-fears-2022-06-13/) I wonder how many shit companies out there with lazy management and a broken business model are going to fail as inflation continues to rise and the fed increases rates. According to Bloomberg, 20% of the top 3000 companies in the US are zombies. \n\nIs that the real bubble that pops this thing and sends us into a depression? It could be, who knows. I think that the US will be fine over the long term so long as the fed stops printing money and allows the economy to fix itself naturally.

It pisses me off that detailed analysis has less value than someone‚Äôs gut feeling or opinion. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt time the market‚Äù = fucking bullshit. It also pisses me off that bad companies get bailed out by big govt. Chroney capitalism. \n\nIt wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if stopping the money printing meant a struggling US economy over the next 10 years.

For most people working at Amazon, the turn and burn thing doesn't mean the next day you get shitcanned, you can head over to MS or Google and land a job there, because they are, by and large, different skillsets.\n\nAmazon, first and foremost, isn't a tech company. I mean, AWS is small in absolute size (even if their revenue is an outsized portion), but Amazon is a logistics and retail company first. Without it, they can't plow money back into AWS to keep that operation alive. The labor pool that logistics companies draw from are -- and this is my commie jargon coming up -- the reserve army of labor. It's the part of the working class that is used to threaten and discipline the rest of the working class, so there's a functional reason they keep doing hiring drives, even if they're slowing down. They draw people in because it's a paycheck, but if you don't fall exactly in line, you lose your livelihood and it shows other workers to not do that.\n\nBut that's what it comes down to: for manual labor, there's a dearth of quality jobs. Amazon is kinda the last stop in a country that's been deindustrialized. In the absence of any major education push or training program, it's what people have until they're chewed up and spit out on the other side.\n\nYou are correct, though: this will hurt Amazon's ability to keep quality people because they keep firing them and locking them out of future opportunities across all amazon-owned brands. But their culture is very much one of present business and not too much forward thinking. That's why they have a chaotic internal culture, and it's definitely not the best of the best getting moved up.\n\nIt's a side effect of growth at all costs.

I also don‚Äôt quite understand the bigger picture of things, like leverage ratios.

What is very very interesting about this CPI is that this is the HIGHEST level of CPI that the fed has predicted yet. Remember just two months ago they tried to tell us that CPI was peaked yet here we are with a prediction of 8.8%. \n\nMy thoughts are that with the Feds projecting CPI to be 0.5% higher than their last projection which usually misses by about 0.2% at times I suspect we are going to get a reading of 9% CPI. \n\nWhen we get this 9% CPI we are going to see the VIX massively spike which will cause us to dump hard af. We then will for the next 2 weeks while we wait for FOMC, earnings and GDP continue to dump (I made a post last night about going long on VIX/ UVXY calls I definitely recommend you read it as it adds to all of this too). \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j9jfishi47b91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1ce646bbdfe5b81247539cc0abdb93511072043\n\nI will be SHOCKED if CPI is anything but 9% but I took profits on almost everything but my UVXY calls cause I don‚Äôt trust this market or the fed lol. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/drqk190j47b91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9b811ecb36df38de701e9ef660dc0f803812893\n\nOverall the daily looks clear as to where we are going‚Ä¶ I mentioned last week we looked to be in a 370 to 390 channel and that is exactly what this week has played out as. I would be shocked if we don‚Äôt see 370 tomorrow (-2.7% day). If we break through 370 and close under it this week I think we are going to be setting up for 340-350 by EOM. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aaih33lj47b91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e429b5ba985120726ee44900f825a15aa780105\n\nMonday I called out the 3810 level for ES futures that I expected us to see. Here we are hitting it intraday today. PT for futures is 3675 by EOW (-4% from 3820). Overall we finally see a close below the daily 8ema on ES futures which we were waiting for to have confirmation of down trend. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bvzov25k47b91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb6fc1e00bc53da78f0f83ac0b9dff88277ab6ea\n\nThe one weird outlier today was the VIX. Even with that massive 1.3% sell off EOD today from 1pm to 345pm we never saw the vix break 28. Which tells me that the VIX (fear) did not lead this sell off but rather sheer volume. We had some pretty low sell pressure for how strong of a sell off we had though. We only saw -1.5 at the peak when most big dumps see -5 to -10. \n\nI am highly expecting the VIX to finally spike tomorrow when the market get rocked by a 9% CPI. A 25% vix day is likely and would put VIX near 35. \n\n10% challenge-\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c1x4agyk47b91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=12bd0b8710ab0331cc1f04d977c82cea0168bdca\n\nOverall the server had a great day today. We definitely took profits too early but hard to say no to 30% and 50% gainers! Great day overall for sure. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5ht4w0ol47b91.png?width=777&format=png&auto=webp&s=b47abe9addc123b95552ba8c4f433de0c3376af3\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vvcmcv2m47b91.png?width=605&format=png&auto=webp&s=733818a597f13c3debc2f3fef92a2ead5ef812a1\n\nMy plan WAS to carry some 5 otm puts overnight. However, I decided to take proifits on everything instead. I also wanted to hold those 3dte puts till Friday but I just couldn‚Äôt say no to the gains. While I have high conviction we see a bad CPI and a big dump tomorrow im not chancing gains if I don‚Äôt have to.   \n \n\nI decided to hold my UVXY calls as I still have not see the VIX spike that we are waiting for. The fear hasn‚Äôt hit the market yet and tomorrow it will. And if im wrong then im wrong but with these UVXY calls in the off chance that CPI isn‚Äôt too bad I should be able to get out still with a small loss. It was the smartest play. But if im right and Cpi is trash we are looking at vix 30-35 and UVXY 16-18.

{"title": "Car repossessions are surging ‚Äî a troubling sign for the used car market", "selftext": "There's a troubling situation spreading among car owners that could portend an implosion of the used car industry, according to a new report.¬†\n\nRepossessions of vehicles are surging, and have even doubled among so-called \"prime\" borrowers, or people with good to excellent credit scores who are considered the least likely to default on their lows, Lisa Beilfuss Popeo, a senior writer for Barron's, told CBS News.\n\nRepossessions occur when a borrower falls behind on their car payments, giving the lender the right to seize the vehicle. The rise in repossessions comes after car prices surged during the pandemic, as auto manufacturers struggled to meet demand amid chip shortages and other issues. Used car prices rose particularly sharply, with the average used car price jumping almost¬†17% in May¬†to more than $32,000.¬†\n\n\"You have used car prices skyrocketing and people having to borrow more and more to get their hands on a car,\" Beilfuss Popeo said.¬†\n\nUsed car market \"bubble\"\n\nAmericans had \"temporary pockets of income\" during the pandemic, thanks to stimulus checks, extra unemployment aid and Child Tax Credit payments, allowing them to pay up for pricier cars, she added.¬†\n\nThat's caused concerns among experts that the used car market is in a \"bubble,\" Beilfuss Popeo noted.\n\nBut those government supports have ended, and many families are now facing budget shortfalls given the¬†highest inflation in 40 years. As a result, more consumers are defaulting on their auto loans, with subprime repossessions up 11% since 2020,¬†according¬†to the auto-news site Jalopnik.¬†\n\nAnd repossessions among prime borrowers has doubled from 2% to 4% during the past two years, Beilfuss Popeo said.¬†\n\n\"One red flag is the rate of repossession for prime borrowers is starting to rise. It's not just subprime borrowers that are having problems,\" she noted.\n\nBut there is a bright spot, said Popeo, who believes the rapid rise in interest rates as a result of aggressive Fed hikes should cool the market as intended. \"Demand is cooling ‚Äî it should lower prices for certain things, like cars.\"\n\nhttps://www.cbsnews.com/news/used-car-bubble-market-repossessions-are-surging/", "id": "w0wqi7", "created_utc": 1658024748.0, "score": 230, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 122, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|98|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|30|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|10 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=w0wqi7)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=w0wqi7)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Meanwhile the dealerships here are charging a minimum of $8000 ABOVE sticker price for any vehicle, ‚Äúdue to high demand and short supply ‚Äú", "score": 87, "replies": [{"body": "For now.

{"title": "Rate hikes will surprise everyone", "selftext": "When I was eating my daily dose of crayons, I thought that there is a relevant aspect of FED rate hikes that we are overlooking. The two relevant reserve currencies in the world are the USD and the EUR, the former constitutes 59% of reserves, the latter 21%. In the last year the EUR tanked, from 1.24 USD it reached parity with the USD, now standing proudly at 1.02. \n\nThis helped to cushion the inflation in the US, because the trade deficit of the country is huge (860 billion USD in 2021), and all these imports come dirt cheap when the dollar is strong. The US imports \\~3400 billion USD worth of stuff annually, and surprisingly only a small part of this huge amount are industrial raw materials (522 billion USD), the majority (1859 billion USD) is comprised of capital goods, consumer goods, automobiles, and food&feed ( [https://www.investopedia.com/news/what-are-top-us-imports/](https://www.investopedia.com/news/what-are-top-us-imports/) ). In the US inflation is already at four-decades high while all these imports are getting significantly cheaper as the USD gets stronger. \n\nUp till now the strengthening of the USD was almost a certainty, the FED started rate hikes, and although base interest rate still stands at 1.75%, it is still higher than the measly -0.5% the ECB uses, EUR being the only relevant competitor for the USD as a reserve currency. And it seemed highly unlikely that the ECB will ever start rate hikes, as the fragmented European economy would simply push Italy into bankruptcy in the event of rate hikes.  This stalemate prevented rate hikes for years and weakened the Euro as a currency.\n\nThis changed last week. The ECB finally found a way to increase interest rates (by 0.5%, but promised aggressive hiking) and start QT without pushing Italy over the ledge. They can simply sell more German debt and even buy Italian papers until the sum of these transactions still decreases the ECB's pile of assets. Simply after a decade the EU found a way to increase interest rates without falling apart. More rate hikes are on the horizon, we have a decade to catch up on. \n\nThis is extremely dangerous for the FED. After a decade the ECB can finally increase base interest rate, most likely the EUR will strengthen while the USD will weaken. A weakening Dollar will re-ignite inflation in the US, all those imports will become much more expensive. Simply because us Europoors finally managed to sort out our shit. \n\nThe ECB's solution forced the FED to increase rates just to keep the Dollar's purchasing power. A long-dormant player entered the arena that can blow up inflation in the US. The only defense against the strong Euro is increasing interest rates in the US. The FED will not turn dovish until the ECB does, and we have a decade to catch up on.
