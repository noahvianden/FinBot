The bottom didn’t drop out of the dollar before because the fed was able to sell the lie that this expansion in their balance sheet was a temporary measure. The federal reserve expanded their balance sheet from 800 billion to 4+ trillion. Fast forward a couple years, they start QT and start to raise rates. Since I knew the federal reserve would not act independent, i knew they would run in to save the stock market at any chance. Gold is at 1200 around summer time. Then a couple of months later during last December the fed hiked to 2.5% and it was too much for the market to handle. The market pulled back like 5%, which isn’t even that much (just shows you how worried they are), and the fed comes out and says they’re cutting rates. They’re calling this a “mid-course adjustment” acting like they’re going to go back to raising rates soon. Over the last couple of months the fed restarted QE 4, more stimulus for a market at all time highs. The balance sheet has expanded by half a trillion and will continue to grow. Inflation by definition is the expansion of the money supply. So If we’re going to go off of that, the realistic inflation rate is 7%. \n\nSo now the fed is stuck. Rates will be at 0 soon and the fed will have no “monetary ammo” to get us out of the next recession. You typically need 4-5% of rate cuts during a recession to lift the economy out of it.

The fed will either be forced to raise rates during a recession or send us into stagflation (high unemployment and inflation). The loss of confidence in a currency is one that’s very hard to gain back. Hyperinflation and economics are also a psychological phenomena. \n\nIf we have trillion dollar deficits now, imagine during the recession, it’ll be 2-3 trillion in the midst of it.

Yeah no definitely “earned” more money than everybody in the history of the world and it wasn’t at all by unethically getting rid of all other competition...\n\nAnd again yes he gave more than what people will in a lifetime. However, using metrics he’s estimated to have donated $2 billion which is 1.5% of his wealth. To an [average American, with a net worth of 100,000 (97,300 is the real number but we’ll round to make it easier)](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/whats-your-net-worth-and-how-do-you-compare-to-others-2018-09-24) that would be $1,500. This info is from 2016 but with inflation and rounding my point stands. [People with an net worth of $15,000 gave on average $1, 471](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.usatoday.com/amp/36561381) which is 10% of their wealth...so while yes Jeff Bezos has given more than any human being alive. He also has managed to average giving 8.5% LESS than the LOWEST NET WORTH INDIVIDUALS IN AMERICA. \n\nDoes he have to give any of his money away? Absolutely not, but we need to stop looking at him like he’s a charitable person. In perspective he hasn’t given fucking shit compared to charitable people. [The total amount of money he gave to charity from 2000-2017 was $67 million dollars](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.vox.com/platform/amp/future-perfect/2019/11/25/20981946/charity-billionaire-jeff-bezos-bill-gates-wealth-tax). In 2017 he’s average money per day was $70million. He made more ONE DAY in 2017, than he gave throughout 17 years. AGAIN he doesn’t need to give out his wealth, but people need to stop pretending and writing fucking stories about how he’s a charitable person. (I get he doesn’t ask but he understand PR hence why his giving went up 1% in a year after he got chastised for not giving enough).

{"title": "A serious discussion about the sentiment and direction of this sub: Both short and long term", "selftext": "**I will start by saying I have posted this in the daily discussion area, but since have been urged to make a separate post to ensure it gets seen and not buried.**\n\nI've been subscribed to this sub since April last year, and have enjoyed my time here as most of us have. However, the sudden and deserved (coming from a TSLA bull) stock price increase has attracted a lot of new subscribers and thus a lot of newfound euphoria. This euphoria was shared and tolerated at first, but now it seems to be the popular thought that it has taken away from the informative and unbiased discussions we used to have in this sub. The subreddit built by a community of TSLA shareholders seems to be overran with \"just bought x more shares\" and \"HODL\" bitcoin nonsense, all while posts/comments of significance are short-replied and brushed off. Other posts, as u/flufferbot01 has pointed out, offer fair criticism and may bring real concerns to shareholders, yet is dismissed without thought as \"FUD\". Are we becoming what some here have accused other subs as: an echo-chamber?\n\nSome have expressed their opinions of this matter within the daily thread post, while others have stated they have considered unsubscribing and removing themselves from the community due to its lack of discussion of anything except the stock price. I also received a private message asking if I wanted to start a new subreddit to get back to basics: fundamental discussion of the company. Is this how we proceed? Splitting the community?\n\n I, myself, am not a mod and cannot do anything to restore the sentiment of this sub apart from making a post. I can, however, suggest we create some additional guidelines to battle this repelling behavior.\n\n1. I'm requesting, with the support of others in previous daily threads, we ban the word \"HODL\" and phrases alike. This is a stock of a real company, not a cryptocurrency.\n2. Also proposed: adding post flairs to sort and encourage posts outside of the daily thread. This subreddit is growing and would benefit from such search features (even if optimized in the future).\n3. We all know what the stock price is, for most of us are also invested in the company and keep track of this. I do not see the merit in spamming the daily thread with green/red updates.\n4. Bearish arguments should be welcomed and not downvoted (and thus buried). Give some thought and discussion to those who do not share the same sentiment as you. Who knows, maybe you can learn or share some insight you never would have otherwise.\n5. Snobby comments about TSLA stocks isn't a good look. If you are invested in a company, chances are you are an adult. Act like one. If anybody serious about their investment were to visit this subreddit and see \"We don't invest in stocks, we invest in TSLA\" my guess is they will consider us an immature community and spend their time elsewhere. I, for one, hope the community grows in hopes more people bring focused discussion and opposing arguments.\n\nThese are just some opinions and suggestions myself and others have brought up in the past few weeks. Feel free to critique and add to them as you see fit.

I think we can satisfy both groups by using 2 different recurring threads. One focused on short-term trading and current stock-price. Another one that zooms out for the bigger picture view and focuses on everything that’s relevant for the long-term of the company and the stock.\n\nAgain, this is just a suggestion: I would make it clear in the discussion of the Daily thread that it is the right place for short-term trade-related discussion (current stock-price, anything short-term option related, etc...). And then maybe add a new Weekly Big Picture Investor Discussion thread where we don’t really focus on the day-to-day movement, but where people can discuss/analyse whatever is relevant in the longer term for both the stock and the company.\n\nI think that would take some of the frustrations away (as depending on your interests you only follow one of those threads, or both). Flufferbot also had a good idea on using flairs on posts to make it easier to find stuff that’s relevant for you.

If the comment doesn't raise an idea, debate an idea already raised, or provide sources to further the discussion, it gets removed. Everything else is functionally an \"upvote with commentary\". \n\nThe issue is that if you tried to apply this to today's daily thread, for example, you would have 80 removed comments (I'm being kind at only 80) out of the first 200 shown. I counted. There would be an argument for probably 200 of the 425 currently there. In short, if we tried to apply this all of a sudden, it would mean a few days of absolutely nuked threads until people adjusted. That's a bit too hard of a sell, in my opinion, and would annoy people genuinely just hyped because *holy f--- look at what the stock price has done recently*.
