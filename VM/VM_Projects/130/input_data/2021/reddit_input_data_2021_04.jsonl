{"title": "CVS is incredibly undervalued", "selftext": "Hopefully most of you are getting your vaccine and you’re thinking about how important your health is. Now I may be called a boomer with this pick I can promise you I’m not. CVS Health is the largest healthcare company in the US with about the 4th/5th largest amount of revenue of all companies. They are projected to earn about $7.50 this year and over $8 next year which at the current price of $75 in insanely cheap in a market seeing the overall market trading at ~25x earnings.\n\nWhy is so cheap you may ask? Well I’d argue it’s for two reasons 1) Constant fear around Amazon 2) Concern they paid too much for Aetna a few years back. People always fear the unknown and it’s usually from a place of misunderstanding. Let’s take Amazon first. Amazon awhile back said they were going to get into Healthcare and formed a venture with Berkshire and JPM called Haven. I think CVS stock and others dropped 15% on the news when first announced. Now these are big companies and if anyone is going to upend the model it would be them. Well flash forward a few years and they disbanded the operation citing it was too challenging or something like that. This past year Amazon also made news by launching Amazon Pharmacy and more recently Amazon Telehealth for employers. I get what you’re thinking oh no here they come it’s over. This is absolutely hilarious if you actually understood how CVS makes money. Let me tell you how:\n\nCVS has a few primary businesses: CVS Caremark, CVS Aetna, and CVS retail.\n\nCVS Caremark is the largest drug dealer in the US. They are what is referred to as a PBM or prescription benefit manager. As an employer whether it be a public government agency or private employer like Amazon you go through a PBM to acquire your drug benefit coverage for your employees. CVS has thousands of employers ironically including Berkshire, JPM, and Amazon as clients. There are really only three main players in the space (Optum, Express Scripts, and Caremark) which are owned by United Health, Cigna, and CVS which also happen to be health insurers which we’ll get to later. This is where scale really matters. As an employer you want to give your employees the cheapest drugs. As a PBM you use your purchasing power across your customers to buy drugs from manufacturers at the lowest cost. This is why these 3 companies have an impenetrable moat in this industry. Caremark probably buys almost 1/3 of the drugs dispensed in this country. This is why I laugh when I think about the Amazon fears. There is no way they could ever reach the scale of buying power to price drugs low enough to entice employers and government agencies to switch. Unless they’re throwing in a free Prime membership for everyone I think it’s basically impossible for them to break in unless they buy one of the big 3. So what is Amazon Pharmacy you ask? Amazon Pharmacy is just a re-branding of Amazon Pillpack their mail order pharmacy they acquired a few years back. Is it not a threat? Not in the least and that goes back to the pricing model many people don’t understand. Let me explain. If you’re covered by Caremark as an employee of say Wells Fargo you can go anywhere to fill your prescription...CVS, Walgreens, Walmart, Costco, or even Amazon. However if you go onto GoodRx and enter your insurance info you’ll see that there are a variety of prices for the same drug. It will always be cheapest at CVS as Caremark will give CVS the best rates. What’s better is all those other places actually pay CVS to be included in their network and have access to their PBM network. So if you fill at Walgreens they make money and if you fill at CVS they make more money. So when people say Walgreens is just a drug store but CVS is more than a drugstore this is part of it. Walgreens and other places you fill drugs don’t have PBMs that represent a huge % of America’s insured.\n\nNow let’s get to the real undervalued gem in their business Aetna. Aetna is the health insurance side of the business and fastest growing. This is the other part of the equation for employee benefits and again same major players in United Healthcare and Cigna. This business encompasses health and dental insurance. Aetna was acquired a few years back in one of the largest acquisitions and largely funded by debt. As you can imagine Wall St hated the deal except for the bankers that did it of course. What’s crazy is CVS was surprised and ecstatic that the deal even closed as it was heavily scrutinized by the Justice department at the time. What I would say about a deal that large is no Board would sign off on that if there wasn’t huge upside to the deal. I mean talk about YOLO let’s borrow a ton of money ($60B) and buy a company. If you are doing that there better be 3x or more the upside, right? So what was Wall St missing? Well first you have to understand the health insurance business which is the same premise as any insurance business which is to insure against risks. Geico insures you against a major car accident while Aetna insures you against a major medical surgery or cancer treatment. What many people don’t understand is the #1 cause of a major medical expense is usually preventive maintenance. Yes exercise but more so taking your medication. I like to say this is akin to Geico being able to tap your breaks if you start to speed in your car. CVS has your health data and if you’re an Aetna member they’re insuring you. So CVS can use that data to intervene early to prevent a major medical event they’d have to pay out on down the road. This is a win/win for all involved and is how CVS is going to change healthcare. I mean this is a health flywheel that will just allow them to win more business.\n\nWhere I’m most excited for them is for their Health Hub strategy. If you are unfamiliar think of it as urgent care within CVS stores. Why I’m most excited is because of what it allows them to do that their competitors can’t. I’m a parent and my wife and I have had many ear infections that we’ve had to run to the Little Clinic which is a similar concept you may have seen in Fry’s grocery stores. Today with our insurance an ear infection and a Little Clinic visit is about $75. Well Aetna is rolling out $0 co-pay plans for these acute care needs at Health Hub stores. $0 is pretty nice! So next time we have an ear infection we can roll up to a CVS Health Hub and get the kiddos checked out, pick up the script for meds, and pick up a bottle of wine for us on the way out. This has huge implications for the industry that nobody is quite grasping yet. It also has huge implications for the retail part of their business that will drive a ton more foot traffic and profits. Just today they said by 2030 they are looking to do 75 billion health interactions. For reference Teladoc did 15M last year in a pandemic year. \n\nSo hopefully I’ve cleared up a lot of misconceptions about CVS and the true business they are in along with who their true competitors are. They are really in an oligopoly with 3 players who have paid the price of admission which is having a PBM and Health Insurance business combination. If Amazon truly wanted to play in this space my belief is that they’d have to acquire one of the 3 as they would have to buy business to compete with the scale/spend on drugs. I honestly think they realized with Haven that this is a tough nut to crack. So oligopoly businesses are usually good to invest in but the one you want to own is CVS because they have a monopoly in stores. There is a CVS within a few miles of everyone in the US which allows them to unlock a lot of value that people have written off as useless before.\n\nValuation:\nCurrently trading at $75 which is ~10 earnings in a market that is over 25x. So it’s way too cheap here but this isn’t a stock to YOLO weekly calls on this is stock to own for a long time. A couple years back they put out an investor presentation showing 10% EPS growth annually past 2022. The best part is it was based on 28% tax rates so tax increases baked in. If you actually model this out this decade you’re talking $19+ dollars EPS in 2030. Throw a 15-20 multiple on that and you’re at $300+. Now I know stocks were going up like that in a month (ahem GME) but for the most part investors shouldn’t ever expect those returns overnight. SP500 annual avg. return is 10% and with where valuations and interest rates are at I suspect we’ll be lucky this decade to average that. So going back to CVS at current price of $75 with $300+ at end of this decade in the cards that works out to a pretty nice avg annualized return of close to 20% assuming you reinvest the dividends. And people might scoff at the thought of them doing double digit EPS growth but if you look up pre Aetna they did just that. Even if they fall short you might see 15% avg annualized which as an investor you can’t expect much better.\n\nWould love to hear everyone’s thoughts!", "id": "mhn92l", "created_utc": 1617250123.0, "score": 143, "upvote_ratio": 0.76, "num_comments": 120, "comments": [{"body": "Should wait for the dip. Looking at the past four months the stock goes up, and then down.\n\nNov 23rd 66.78 - Dec 4 74.50\nDec 28 68.08 - Jan 11 73.99\nMar 2nd 68.13 - March 16 75.07\n\nNext time it goes on sale load up on calls.\nDo at 70 sell at 75.\n\nRn the price of the stock is 75 and atm 75.50c April 23rd cost 1.75.   1.75/75=2.3% of the price of stock. So atm three weeks out cost about 2.3% but let's say 2.5% to have some room for error.\n\nAt 70 the calls should cost 70*.025=1.75(cause we bumped it .2% to have room for error.)\n\nWhen it goes back to 75 the profit will be 75-1.75-70=$3.25 per call\n\nSo let's say we buy 50 lots that is 5,000 calls it would cost altogether 8,750 your return would be 5,000*5=25,000 for a net profit of 25,000-8,750=16,250\n\nEasy low risk two bagger. Thanks for this. Could probably make this a four or five bagger by upping the risk and going 2  or 3 dollars otm.\n\nLow risk for wsb. I'm going do math for further otm will update post\n\nSo using the 77c 4/23 as a proxy it cost .91 so when the stock is below 70 three weeks out & $2 otm should cost less then .91 for the 72c while at 70.\n\n110 lots of 100 is going cost 10,010\nReturn at 75 would be 75-72=3*110*100=33,000\nNet profit=33,000-10,010=22,990\n\nSo atm would be a little less then doubling your money while doing $2otm would double it plus a little extra. I don't think that is really worth the added risk, especially if it doesn't get to 75 and only goes to 74 or if you wanted to be safe and close at 74 it would take off a huge part of the return.\n\nDon't forget extrinsic value.

{"title": "MYOV: Deep Value and Possible Buy Out", "selftext": "Okay smooth brains, gonna come at you with some DD on a true value play (for those of you that can read). With a great entry as of writing.\n\nThe good stuff:\n\n1 great drug, 3 potential use cases.\nThe basics of any biotech pharma company are the drugs and what they do. Simply put, relugolix (orgovyx) was approved by the FDA in December for the treatment of Prostate Cancer. The drug was so much better than its competition, they were granted priority review by the FDA. How much better were they? Well the competition was a once a month shot that had a high mortality rate due to cardiovascular issues. Since this approval, they have signed a 4.3b deal with pfizer for half the drug, and are now commercializing this together at a rapid pace.\n\nThe other use cases are endometriosis and uterine fibroids. Uterine fibroids have a pdufa (fda approval deadline) of June 1st and after meeting and exceeding all 3 phases of clinicals, are highly likely to pass (these are big positive catalysts).\n\nThis is also accompanied by 2 additional publications in the New England medical journal. One of the most renowned journals in the world.\n\nNow that we’ve covered the basics in Lehman’s terms, let’s move on to the strategic outlay.\n\n\nIn january of 2021, Pfizer and Myovant announced a strategic partnership for men’s prostate cancer worth up to 4.3b for myovant. It also resulted in heavy upfront cash payments, and royalties in the double digits to myovant moving forward. After this announcement, the stock shot up to $31 a share.\n\nBefore this, another pharma giant, sumitomo, decided it was going to expand its pharmaceuticals pipeline. To do so it started an American subsidiary named sumitovant and purchased Roivants share of 5 different companies. To date, 4/5 of the companies are now private with urovant recently getting bought out by sumitovant at 100% premium. \n\nMyovant is the crown jewel of the vants. If you go to sumitovants website, they claim ownership over myovant already (53.5% makes them a majority holder).\n\nIt’s my theory that myovant is not far behind and will likely be purchased before June 1st PDUFA. At this time, the stock has been seeing a pretty large short interest increase and is trading below the PPS it had in November before approval for relugolix and before the Pfizer deal. \n\nWithout a buyout, this is a steal of a value play.\n\nMyovant has roughly 40% of their market cap in cash. Pfizer valued just the prostate cancer application at 8.4b. Their current market cap is ~1.8b and they are trading at $18.93 a share.\n\nI plan to ride this rocket to Valhalla 🚀 🚀 🚀 \n\nTLDR:\nCompany has successful drug applications that are new standards of care, a massive deal with Pfizer, wildly undervalued, and a potential buyout candidate. \n\n🚀 Positions: ~20k shares, 326 calls dated from 4/16 all the way to 1/22\n\nQuick about me: I’ve been on WSB (mostly lurking) since mid 2020 and trading for years.

This works because Pfizer had a right of first refusal to purchase as part of their seed funding agreement with myovant.\nUltimately my main concern is that 3 of the board members are sumitovant plants, and that they might try to buy the company for less than its worth.\nFurthering concerns, the stock is heavily manipulated due to its low volume. It’s very easy to walk the price down using algos. \nIt also has a high short interest, which will cause a squeeze in the case of a buyout and could possibly send the PPS over the buyout offer. \n\nAt the end of the day, I appreciate the advice, but I’m probably not going to change.

{"title": "TQQQ is a fantastic long term investment, even with a volatility of 50+%", "selftext": "I am making this post because this information is not out there and it seems like most of the \"real investors\" want to ignore these statistics.\n\nEvery time someone talks about TQQQ they only have negative things to say and they don't talk about it like regular long term investments. There are quite literally zero backtests that treat it as a long term investment. With a long term investment you pick a fund or a few funds, buy in and then consistently put money in no matter what the market is doing. But no one seems to acknowledge that if you chose to use the same strategy with TQQQ, even with it's exorbitantly high volatility, it will ALWAYS out perform a regular LT investment.\n\nInstead when people talk about TQQQ they talk about it the exact opposite way that you're supposed to use the stock market; they try to time the market. \"Leveraged ETF's shouldn't be held for more than a day\" they say. So let me show you what the data says when you continually invest every month no matter what the market is doing for 10 years. \n\nThis is simply analyzing TQQQ, starting with $1000 and putting in 200 every month. Obviously you probably don't want to hold 100% TQQQ and common advice is to put in 10% of your income. 200/month is 10% of your income if you make 24k a year. Whereas the average income for individuals in the us is 31k (3100 a year invested) and the average household income in the US is 68k (6800 a year invested). I will post adjusted numbers for that over 10 years at the bottom.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/gallery/RlbXBAN\n\nOver 10 years TQQQ would return 19,237% ROI despite dropping more than 50% 3 times over the course of the 10 years. QQQ, with a downside of no more than 17% returned 3,461% in the same time frame. That is the equivalent of 5.5x greater return than QQQ.\n\nAnd if you want to talk about trading psychology we can do that too. To continue to hold even in a downturn of over 50% just look at the percentage gain over the life of the investment. The investment could lose 96% of it's value (which is incredibly unlikely) and you would still have more than you initially invested. I mean in a bear market most people just distance themselves from the market and just continue to buy despite what's happening in the market anyways.\n\nDo I think this investment strategy is for everyone? No. Its clearly not. But I'm 25, I have 40 years until I need this money anyways. Its definitely not for the feint of heart and if you can't manage your thoughts and emotions in a downturn then stick with regular, low risk etfs. But I can tell you this, the NASDAQ is mostly tech and tech is not going anywhere. Also market indexes are some of the only assets that can and will quite literally grow forever. Over time wealth redistributes; as larger companies die or are split up, smaller company's come up and take their place and indexes pick up these new stocks to continue to grow. \n\nTLDR: the NASDAQ isn't going anywhere, tech will continue to grow, the backtests show that higher volatility (while significantly more stressful) is very much a good thing if the asset maintains value despite fluctuations.\n\nOther results for average incomes:\n1,000 initial investment, 259/month 32,080 total invested, 608,561 10y return\n1,000 initial investment, 568/month 68,040 total invested, 1,261,642 10y return\n\nEDIT: 2 years later after a total downturn of ~80% my tqqq investment is at all time highs today despite being ~60% off all time highs of the underlying asset. The portfolio as a whole is about 10% off of all time highs because the poor performance of treasuries given the debt ceiling issues and rising interest rates.

TQQQ owns stock in each of the QQQ components, swaps with a 10+ major banks, a futures position in the NASDAQ 100.  It does not experience time decay in the sense that options do because futures don't have a strike prices.  The bank swaps insure that the futures position maintains an appropriate daily leverage.  \n\nAny change is not because of time decay in holdings of TQQQ, the bank swaps make sure of that.  I understand contango and backwardation, I trade UVXY where that's a key concept, but those aren't a factor in the price of TQQQ at all.  \n\nTQQQ decay is no joke: average annual return for the past 10 years is 47.65%, which is only 2.4x the average annual return for QQQ over the past 10 years (19.92%).

This is a risk that most tesla bulls don't give enough credit to. Obviously nobody is close to making an EV nearly as good, but the current market cap assumes massive dominance and a risk-weighted portion of rediculous profits from FSD. Like tesla is valued at 4x Toyota when Toyota makes 8m cars a year and tesla has a goal of 20m (i.e. 2.5x) in 2030.

Huawei, Mobileye, apple) comes out with a legit FSD competitor in the same time frame as tesla that could seriously dent the profits tesla can realize from it and in turn the valuation.

SHA-256 is a \"hashing algorithm” with certain properties that is key to how Bitcoin works in several areas. Hashing algorithms can be used in decentralized data stores to make it expensive to add data to the decentralized data store, while at the same time making very cheap to verify if a potential transaction added by someone else on the network to your clone of the datastore was added only after spending a lot of expensive electricity. One way it is used in Bitcoin is such that 1) you have to use a lot of computing power to be able to add a transaction (or techincally speaking, a block of \\~2759 transactions) to the network and 2) if some wants to verify that you used a lot of computing power (rather than you just being able to say \"I used a lot of computing power guys! Let me add the following transaction to the network (you transferring 1000 BTC to your address)\" and have everyone trust you) they can do so themselves with very little computational power.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf I understand correctly, currently it costs some amount less than $300k (depends on the price of your electricity / your mining rig setup) to submit a block of (about 2759  transactions to the BTC network. Simply speaking, the way BTC uses SHA-256 is it creates a virtual haystack and virtual needle and forces bitcoin nodes trying to add blocks (of transactions) to find that needle in that computational haystack. Every 2 weeks the BTC network tweaks how it uses SHA-256 to make that haystack a bit bigger or smaller, such that taking into account all the bitcoin miners in the world, some miner will on average find a needle in a new haystack every 10 minutes. Since currently the reward for finding that needle (the BTC network rewards people who spend electricity to add transactions to the network) is 6.25 BTC, miners currently must on average be able to find the needle with less than $312.5k (= 6.25 BTC \\* $50k USD/BTC) of compute costs to profitably operate themselves on the network.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe \"256\" in SHA-256 means that some of the numbers being used to construct this virtual haystack, are 256 bits in length, aka there are 2\\^256 such numbers, also known as 1.16 \\* 10\\^77 numbers. As you could imagine, this enables the Bitcoin network to create very complex haystacks that take a lot of search time to find the needle.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe BTC protocol is actually pretty simple and a lot of programmers learn it for fun.

It’s about to be listed on the NASDAQ on April 27th under the ticket $MNMD. Friday, the stock price jumped 65%.\nDon’t get me wrong, these therapies are on the path for FDA approval... eventually. The research insofar has been promising for treatment-resistant depression and PTSD. But MindMed doesn’t have anything past phase 2 clinical trials. THERE IS NO INDICATION THEY WILL GET ANYTHING ONTO THE MARKET IN THE NEXT 5 YEARS. According to the FDA, about 33% of drugs which make it to phase 2 actually pass onto phase 3. That being said: if you’re willing to take those odds and have disposable income, have at it. But also think about the clinical practicality. On the company’s website, they describe their therapy as giving patients psilocybin, blindfolding them, and giving them headphones with a special playlist so they can vibe out FOR 8 HOURS.\nHow is this practical in an outpatient doctor’s office? Until there is an abortive treatment for psilocybin trips, I don’t see this working out on a large scale.\nSure, the stock will likely pop off for a couple days.

Those of you with a job perhaps thought working from home would require a new laptop and what have you.   \n AMD delivers the chips for all this.

Can’t blame them. AMD will in coming quarters buy XLINX and expand their business to other segments in the semi conductor industry so there is plenty of room for further growth on the outlook.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n  **Supply and competition**\n\nTSMC is the main foundry supplier for AMD. They have kept prices intact but there are so far rumors that they might hike them soon enough. Last year many of the sites were shut down and capacity hasn’t met the surge we have seen late quarters. The problem is not exclusive for AMD but it’s the same for most of its competitors. They have stated though that they expect to be back on track for 2022. Intel got hammered last week in earnings with losing market share in datacenter segment and margins absolutely murdered. AMD has been trading inverse to Intel basically as the market expects AMD to be one of the main causes to Intel's howler.\n\nHowever let the bears beware of the CEO’s lady Su’s own words live:  \n \"we have enormous demand, demand is very, very strong\" continuing their seeing record growth in multiple areas including PC, gaming and datacenter.

My cents are on her being right and even a bit conservative on it.\n\n  \n\n**Analysts**\n\nMarket analysts are quite divided on the target ranging between 70 and 135. The best rated one here Hans Mosesmann has a price target of 120.

{"title": "I analyzed 66,000+ buy and sell recommendations made by financial analysts over the last 10 years. Here are the results.", "selftext": "**Preamble:** I suppose all of us have come across an analyst report while doing DD on a stock. Most of the reports that are freely available to the average investor are either dated or limited in access (we only have the buy/sell ratings and not the deep dive on the stock). According to [this](https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/blog/put-price-investment-research-2/) Bloomberg report, Goldman Sachs charges $30K for access to its basic research, JP Morgan $10K per report, and Barclays charging up to $455K for its equity research package.\n\nWhat I wanted to know was if you actually pay for the reports and then follow their recommendations, would you be able to beat the market in the long run? Surprisingly, there were no trackers following the performance of analyst picks over the long term and I decided to build one.\n\n**Where is the data from:** Yahoo Finance. I used yfinance API to pull all the analyst recommendations made from 2011 for S&P500 companies. While this is in no way a complete list of recommendations, I felt that the data I had was deep enough for the analysis. Both Bloomberg and Quandl provide richer data but costs more than $20K for their subscription and also won’t allow you to share the recommendations with the public. (I have shared all the recommendations and my analysis in an Excel Sheet at the end)\n\n**Analysis:** There were a total of 66,516 recommendations made by analysts over the last 10 years for S&P500 companies.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8dddldhpyiv61.png?width=567&format=png&auto=webp&s=87815030b030a145b4b28699755dca67aada1f1b\n\nFor the three sets, I calculated the stock price change across four periods.\n\na. One week after recommendation\n\nb. One month after recommendation\n\nc. One quarter after recommendation\n\nI benchmarked the change against S&P500 and also checked what percentage of recommendations increased in value compared to the benchmark. I limited my time horizon to one quarter since analysts usually create reports every quarter and I did not want to overlap different recommendations. Finally, I also checked which banks made the best recommendations over the last decade.\n\n**Results:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9aejospqyiv61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=4333db3ef1bdf35e4e9bb235de1bdda5a331e129\n\nOut of the 35K buy recommendations made by the analysts, the average increase in stock price across the time periods was better than the SPY benchmark with one week returns bettering SPY by more than 40%. Adding to this, I also benchmarked the percentage of times analysts made the call and the stock price went up vs the SP500 index.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tiz3b3qsyiv61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=65233193d329d16067c7f594f4de19f1455c49ae\n\nSell recommendations given by analysts definitely have a short-term impact on the stock price. As we can see from the chart, the one-week performance of stocks that were recommended as a sell was lower than that of the benchmark. But this trend does not hold over the long term with stocks having sell recommendations significantly outperforming the market over the time period of more than one month. Another thing to note here is that on average even after the sell recommendation, the stock price did not fall. (ie, the returns were not negative)\n\n**Which investment banks made the best recommendations?:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n0gekgktyiv61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f2d186f3339e0578a72903c507560b415652a41\n\nI analyzed the returns of the recommendations made by different banks. The most number of recommendations were made by Morgan Stanley with them making more than 2300 recommendations in the last 10 years. From the above chart, you can see that overall, the best returns were made by Barclays with their recommendations beating SP500 by more than 125% in one-week gains and more than 30% in quarterly gains.\n\n**How much money should you be managing to profitably buy analyst reports?**\n\nI did a rough calculation on the amount of assets you need to be managing to make sense for actually paying for the reports. From the above analysis, we could see that the analyst reports beat the market by 23%, and on average full access to analyst reports of a bank will set you back by $500K per year. Putting in the above numbers, you need to have a whopping $19MM of assets under management just to break even. Going on a conservative side, to comfortably make profits and not to have the analyst report fee considerably impact your returns, you should be managing at least $100MM.\n\n**Limitations of analysis:**\n\nThe above analysis is far from perfect and has multiple limitations. First, this is not the full list of recommendations made by these companies and are just the ones that were updated on Yahoo Finance. I also could not get any information on price targets made by the analysts to supplement my analysis. Finally, even though this analysis covers the last 10 years, it had been predominantly a bull run and this can bias the results in favor of the banks. This aspect could also be seen by observing how poorly the sell recommendations made by the banks faired.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nI started the analysis skeptical of the returns generated by recommendations made by analysts. There has been a lot of rumors and speculations about whether analysts have access to information the public doesn’t. Whatever the case may be, the above analysis shows that if you have access to the analyst reports, you definitely can beat the market over the long run. Whether it's financially viable or not to access the reports depends on the amount of assets you have under management, in this case at least $100MM!\n\nExcel Sheet link containing all the recommendations and more detailed analysis: [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19Hd6xU4B4p0PmlpV3JULmChU1JQTVkOR/view?usp=sharing)\n\n*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor and in no way related to any investment banks showcased above.*", "id": "myygs8", "created_utc": 1619446019.0, "score": 1767, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 130, "comments": [{"body": "That's a lot of work.
