The stock market has been very good these past 10 years, and I realized that sometimes, enough is enough. The market is currently high so there is no shortage of buyers for my stocks, and I can protect myself from inflation going forward through short-term debt instruments.

Let me run you down some fundamentals on why this is an advanced long. Pun intended. (My screen name.)\n\nLet's get to the meaty part first.\n\nLesson #1 Fraud is the most bullish word on Wall street, but even better is Monopoly, and Antitrust. Which is why retail weak fingers are getting walked down. (Regulation is the most feared btw.) If it wasnt for Clover health pulling some strings behind the scenes I dont think they would exist. Clov was caught running a red light, so take the fine, and get back in your Tesla. If not for fraud they wouldn't last a year. United health, and Blue cross would've destroyed them right outta the gate.  Look at the most fraudulent companies in the world. They're sporting the highest market caps. Ask Tesla bear scrubs Einhorn, and Gordon Johnson about how Tesla is a fraud. Apple, Msft, Amzn,  seen fraud litigations. Bring in Vivek, and Chamath. Accused of fraud. Get the point? Fraud is bank as long as your the fraud.\n\nWho cares about Last year? You've heard this right?\n\n\"**Past performance** is **no guarantee** of future **results**\"\n\nA. Grew membership by 36.3%\n\nB. Increased revenue by 45.6%\n\nC. Gross profit increased to 12.2% of revenue\n\nThis means absolutely nothing. Again. **\"Past performance is never an indicator of Future results.\"**\n\n**4 F's  - Future Fun Facts & fundamentals. Speculative Statistics.**\n\nA.  The number of Americans ages 65 and older will more than double over the  next 40 years, reaching 80 million in 2040. The number of adults ages  85 and older, the group most often needing help with basic personal  care, will nearly quadruple between 2000 and 2040.  \ud83d\udc48  (Try search engine)\n\n***Those statistics come true. Minimum +200% customers***\n\nB. Government Medicare spending is set to increase from 15% to 19% \ud83d\udc48  (Try search engine)\n\n***More revenues from the budget.***\n\nC. Medicare for all. \ud83d\udc48  (Try search engine)\n\n***\"Medicare for all\" would push our potential customer base to the moon. (Full Population)***\n\nD.. Clover health's competitors have over a trillion dollars in market cap to swipe.\n\n***Always good to have healthy competition. UNH, ANTM, HUM, CI, plus private ones like Aetna***\n\nE,F,G Highly Speculative. It's a healthcare insurer that's only medicare, and not yet in the workplace.\n\n***If Clover health enters the entire health insurance market whole different valuation is coming.***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR; For those that are patient. This could be a really great long term growth investment. Clover health currently has less than 1% of available participants in healthcare marketplace.\n\nAside from the celebrity status of certain board members I'm going to tuck this one under the mattress, set a recurring investment, and probably have fun losing everything if tit's go up.\n\nEdit; Almost started crying today. So I bought some stocks at that emotional moment. My average on clov is now break even. I caught 6.55 and I didnt lose fingers this time. got august 12.5 calls for .90c too.

{"title": "\ud83c\udf08\ud83e\uddf8 $SPY 250p 3/19", "selftext": "***TL;DR and also IMPORTANT: 3/19 is my short term play (I fudged the title, sorry). I'm doing put spreads, so my full positions (I'll update as I plan on getting in more):***  \n\n\n|Ticker|Expiration|Strike|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|$SPY|3/19|385p|\n|$SPY|4/1|370p|\n|$SPY|5/21|340p|\n|$SPY|6/18|250p|\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere have been major crashes in my lifetime, because the \"American Dream\" died in the 90's. I'm assuming you smooth brains have at least heard of the ***Dotcom bubble***. Maybe you're a baby and are more familiar with the ***Housing Bubble***. Well let me tell you something: next up is the ***Unicorn Extinction*** bubble!!\n\nI love Unicorns, so much so that it's my last name and also the name of my business (totally serious) but this inevitable crash is as much a \"hypothesis\" as evolution is. But the markets seem to love and worship these billion dollar tech unicorns more than I do.\n\n*So here's the breakdown for you retards. I even used crayons and highlighters, and I'll outline it from top to bottom and spell it out to make it really easy for you to understand. Get your kool-aid and prepare to learn something.*\n\nWhat you're looking at below is ***$SPY*** which represents the S-and-P 500. Ooh letters and numbers!\n\nYou know that thing with numbers that you see on the TV sometimes? No, not the channel with the big yellow bird. You see it on that station at the bank that Mommy takes you to sometimes. It's called \"C-N-N\" and it's like REALLY boring, but you sit and drool with a dum-dum in your mouth (because that's what you are) and listen to them say things like \"The S and P is down 15 points today.\" It's a bunch of silly made up words, I know. But those numbers are the reason Mommy is crying and talking to Mr banker...\n\nHere, I'll illustrate it for you. I even used crayons and highlighters. We're going to look at the pretty picture from TOP to BOTTOM, okay?\n\nSo the lines underneath the actual stock price are moving averages (MA). They are the mean line of what a stock should be doing based upon its history. From warm colors (short term MA) to cool colors (long term MA) it's ***normal to see a bit of divergence***. However, the further apart these lines get, the more it's indicative of an ***over-valued market***, maybe so much so that it's going to be a free-fall as the bubble pops. The case I'm making for this Unicorn Extinction (*yes, I'm coining this term, and fucking some financial analyst better quote me when I'm right*) is the result of ***hyper-inflation*** (fed printers go BRRR), ***ridiculous speculation***, and ***over-valued businesses*** (mostly tech) yet again.\n\nThese moving averages have the highest divergence they've ever had!! That's not normal, and it means a price correction is coming, and it's going to be a fucking blood bath! The large green highlight is where the market SHOULD be, at least in my humble and moronic opinion.\n\nThe next box down is a Relative Strength Indicator (RSI). I won't get into the math, because 1+1=banana to you \ud83e\udd8d. Essentially \"traders\" (that's a big boy word) use this to know when a stock is over-bought or over-sold. Are you seeing a pattern on this screenshot?\n\nThe last box down, is harder to see, but this is your Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD). It essentially a mean of other Moving Average lines to indicate when a stock is going to switch directions. I'm zoomed out so far that you can't see all of the warnings, but I've circled them for you. These were the major signs that a crash was coming in the past.   You've been warned. Hope you are prepared for this next crash, and if you want to profit while others suffer (it's a bittersweet feeling) then you can do as I'm doing and short $SPY.\n\nAlso, fuck your \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc4b and \ud83d\ude80 because I already played that game. You go \ud83c\udf08\ud83e\uddf8 or get stung now bitches!! \ud83e\udd82\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wjki2qk35wk61.jpg?width=1621&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b42b773b26582117c18e6e6f6b76de4371d71406", "id": "lx6bdb", "created_utc": 1614811217.0, "score": 42, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 100, "comments": [{"body": "Oh boy \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b alert", "score": 34, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.22165071964263916}, {"body": "If you are gong to choose a retarded strike predicting a market crash at least do something like $325.", "score": 19, "replies": [{"body": "52 week low is like 218.
