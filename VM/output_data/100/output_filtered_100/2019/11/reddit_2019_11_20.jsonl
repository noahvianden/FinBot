Opposing interests to the company, e.g. big oil, ICE manufacturers, and those who stand to lose a lot if Tesla proves EVs to be successful. These are the dirt diggers and fake-news spreaders, the true frauds\n2. The healthy (but gullible imo) skeptics. Those who see difficulties with the financials, see the articles about Elon smoking pot, see the company running at relatively risky financial margins and don't see the bigger picture, who short out of a general fear of the company's well-being.\n3. The emotional shorts, who become #1 through a series of reading fake news, buying into everything, and aligning their financial interests against those of the company.\n\nIn earlier years, I think the short community was largely comprised of #1 & #2... and a general community grew up to share and spread, at an excessive rate & with excessive zeal, as much negativity about the company as possible. Some of which is true... the company has run at dangerously thin margins, EVs were an unproved technology, etc.\n\nOver time the balance has shifted, and the personalities have shifted. Big oil has been able to step away as the #TSLAQ community took on a life of it's own, and new conspiracy theories abounded. This echo chamber (and it is most certainly an echo chamber, see their block-list), now only shares negative news, much of which is unfounded or shared with exaggerated emotional phrasing to drive as much FUD as possible. This community has had a real and negative impact on the company, their ability to raise money, and their car sales. I know a lot of people who are afraid of charging concerns, afraid of the company surviving through their warranty obligations, what if they blow up, etc. This is all materially impacting Tesla through the spread and exaggeration of incorrect information.\n\nI don't know whether Chanos/Einhorn fall into #2 or #3, I think they started out in #2 and it seems that Einhorn certainly became an emotional investor, and he now has accused Elon of fraud on multiple levels. Chanos has some sketchy relationships with a Linette Lopez of Business Insider that is worthy of it's own post, but it appears that he may have been super \"friendly\" to her while she continually tries to dig up dirt on Tesla and consistently releases negative articles that imo aren't newsworthy.\n\nIt's certainly clear that there is a large moneyed agenda against Tesla, it's been written about several times, and should be obvious from the clear polarization that this company causes, there is no company this hated and loved, and the media is responsible for a large amount of the hate while customers/fans are responsible for the love. There is no company as heavily shorted, there is no company threatening as many industries, and there is no CEO whose actions are followed so closely as Tesla's, and the short community is consistently undermining the company through exaggerated fears and the spreading of misinformation. \n\nRegarding investor relations vs ceo job, okay. At my company my CEO literally does 100% of investor relations and that's working out just fine... I find that CEOs are the most informed, the most able to execute decisions, and should be the most prominent spokesperson for the company, so arguing that the CEO shouldn't do that job is a joke. Maybe there should be an IR team that supports the CEO, but the CEO should be in the lead in a lot of that imo.", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5633429884910583}], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Hey thanks for taking the time to reply properly. Can you support that claim about how extremely unusual it is for any company to have that amount of short interest? \n\nThere are legitimate concerns about the financial statements of the company from an accounting perspective. Even the Financial Times have written about this so its not simply a TESLAQ conspiracy. You also have a CEO that is convicted of fraud for the $420 debacle. The suspicions might all be untrue, but nobody can say they are unwarranted. Better to be safe than sorry. \n\nRegarding commenting on the company - The same goes for longs.

There are numerous longs on CNBC as well - Cathy (ARK), Grifford, Chamath (maybe not as much now). Its funny actually because TESLAQ believe the opposite - that most of the media are biased towards the bull case. \n\nAnyway its a bit of a sidetrack - my main point is that Elon has had a very successful quarter and shouldn't really be bothered to reply to Einhorn or Chanos, just let the numbers talk instead.

If an attacker were able to create a Droplet colocated with another user\u2019s Droplet, they could exploit the vulnerability, giving them the ability to shutdown that Droplet within a few minutes.
