If they can stream at like at least 3440x1440 at 60fps, if not 100+ FPS, with ultra low latency... then maybe, but its more likely to be at like 1080 and 30fps at most and with some lag, which is awful for most games in this day and age on PC, and barely acceptable on consoles.\n\nConsole gamers seem to have a fetish for owning physical copies, which is probably smart. While PC almost always has options to allow for re-downloading games on Steam and elsewhere, consoles and their games have a finite lifespan for network support; i.e. physical copies allow you play as long as you have a working console, while your purchase of a digital copy on console may become null once network support for the console sunsets.\n\nA \"Netflix\" of gaming also has content curation issues too. Newer, more popular games will be largely available, but less popular and more obscure games may not make the cut financially (like how licences come and go for content on Netflix and you see movies and shows being dropped and added all the time). It leaves you up to the whims of the curators and game that you would normally play through in your \"Steam backlog\" (essentially the backlog of games that gamers have from buying many games they don't plan to play immediately, due various sales on content and such), may not always be available.\n\nIt may work well for controlled tests with small groups of users, but scaling it up likely won't work as well. Then there are the network bandwidth caps and throttling that ISPs artificially introduce to charge users more fees, which will make users less and less interested in a streaming option. Video may be acceptable at a compressed level, but it takes a lot more to stream a game due to the constant back and forth to update the game state.\n\nVideo really only uses your download speed (the often advertised speed) and most consumers aren't aware that their upload speed is often much, much slower (often at only around 10% of their download). Upload speed is just as important as download with streaming games, because rather than passively receiving data with little to no interaction, you are now needing to constantly take input from the user update the game state and then send that data back to the user.\n\nMicrosoft is also targeting a streaming for the next gen Xbox too (rumors say that they are trying for a streaming only model; originally the Xbox One wasn't even supposed to use discs as seen in the original announcement for it), but its unsure it will ever see the light of day.", "score": 5, "replies": [], "tickers": ["msft", "nflx"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Hopefully true.

There's edge computing and then there's what the big guys like amazon and Google are doing. They aren't just dropping a sever into a network closet and calling it a day. They are taking the same approach to what they did with youtube to make it able to deal with viral videos. Most people can't do this because they don't have the network to support it.
