We just need to know when it works and when it doesn't so that we can prepare for it.\n\n**DO THIS**\n\nFind a strategy that works in a normal market first, so that you will know what it looks like in a bad market.\n\nDon't trade whatever everyone is trading or asking people what to trade. Figure out your own strategy and find underlying that matches the strategy.\n\n**2) I did not know when to get out of a trade**\n\nI never had a trading plan when opening a trade. I did not know when to take profit, or when to cut loss.\n\n**DO THIS**\n\nDecide when to get out of a position before even opening a position. It doesn't have to be a fixed number or a strict rule but at least know roughly when you want/should get out.\n\n**3) I did not know how to analyze the market**\n\nI did not even know how to analyze a single stock let alone analyzing the market. \n\n**DO THIS**\n\nLearn how to analyze charts on the major indexes (or at least S&P500).

I watch it to decide where I will apply the credit from the sale of proceeds, and basically am aiming for the day when all the lots of the shares are \"net $0 cost\" and the continued sale of premiums is absolutely gravy.\n\nThe reason why I disagree with your point is that I am never renewing a bullish position on any of the trades, that has already been made months back. So doing a short put, or buying new shares never happens. The only thing that keeps happening is new short sales of the calls, and at 2X of the volume of shares held.\n\nI dont mind explaining further, I have explained this before on Facebook, and people don't get it either.

Back then they were very expensive so paying a premium for a obsolete machine was not going to end well. Today this is less of an issue because even something obsolete can pretty much do what most people need. Not so back then.\n\nThe MAC had major design issues. Due to being traditional RISC, it was insanely hard to code for and slow as hell at multitasking thus making it a pain to program for and not fun to use. It was good at very specific things like certain vector calculations when implemented correctly (though not for long... MMX killed it).

TDOC's moat is in its 55,000 physicians and 450 sub-specialties on it's platform, not the actual videoconferencing software (anyone can do that). Also the AI component that Livongo provides. TDOC contracts directly with payers who pay a flat fee for their employees/members to use TDOC. What payers seek is better health outcomes aka increased utilization and less hospitalizations which are costly for the payers. $TDOC, utilizing their leading market share to have access to more data than competitors can better train Livongo's models and better assist with chronic care management (diabetes, high blood pressure, etc.) which improves patient's outcomes keeping them away from costly hospital admissions.\n\n3) $TTCF - Plant-based frozen food company that is vertically integrated and rapidly expanding into major retailers.

Amazon has 16 delivery stations in Canada, with seven more on the drawing board.\n\nAmazon will offer several new employees a $1,000 signing bonus and an additional $100 to the vaccinated ones. Amazon offers on-site vaccinations at over 250 locations in the U.S. and Canada.\n\nIn April, Amazon announced an investment of over $1 billion for a wage hike of over 500,000 hourly employees by between 50 cents and $3 an hour.\n\nLast year Amazon added over 500,000 workers globally, the Wall Street Journal reports.\n\nThe hiring comes just before the annual Prime Day shopping event, which was preponed from July to June.\n\nAmazon continues to face employee flak for difficult work conditions in their warehouses including Alabama, and Chicago.

It's \"blue\" but the people are actually very conservative in their way of thinking.   \nFor instance, companies in DC still have yet to adopt the idea that their employees shouldn't have to wear a suit and tie every day. There are a lot of people from close by east coast colleges, or that grew up in the area since people don't often leave, which creates somewhat of a monoculture in certain groups. All the people I left behind there tend to see the \"get married have children\" path as the only real acceptable life path. This is in contrast to the west coast \"liberalism\"where it's more of a do what you want, wear what you want culture. If you don't conform in DC it will be very obvious.   \nThe lobbysts, consultants, lawyers, and want to be politicians dominate the residents, and they are generally not great people. Mostly there's a lot of image, power, and money obsessed people. What the other poster said about people sticking to their own cultural cliques is also true.   \nI find that west coast people enjoy the outdoors more, you'll be hard pressed to find anyone in DC that enjoys anything outdoors besides sports. You're also not near any areas of natural beauty, like SF and hawaii have. The primary form of entertainment is crappy generic biergardens and bars.   \n It's hot and crazy humid in the summer, and biting cold (because of the humidity) in the winter. As everyone mentioned the traffic is horrible, and it's not a very well designed city. If you're not living on a metro line and going somewhere else that's on a metro line you'll have to drive, it's a spread out city so walking isn't great.   \nPositives:  \nThere are a lot of NGOs headquartered there, and those people tend to be super cool. The diversity is amazing, if you can make friends outside of your culture/race it's such an awarding experience. The ethnic food is really really good. The cultural opportunities with the museums etc. are really great. The people tend to really value their friendships much more than you would find in SF or Seattle. Once you're friends with somebody, they'll put you first, instead of what activities they are doing.   \n\n\nGenerally, I think for somebody from the west coast who's mostly been living in culturally liberal places like SF and Seattle (not \"democratic\" just culturally liberal) you'll find that DC is a big culture shock.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "I think it also depends on your age group.

I'm now married to someone not from there but dating there is brutal. Lots of dishonesty and people looking for affairs outside bad marriages they stay in for money and status. Again, I'm talking about my age group. \n\nTotally agree about the dress code for most jobs there but I got lucky with my current company which is really chill when we were in the office but because of COVID we are all now working remote and it will likely stay that way, but we are not the norm. \n\nAgree about the food. I found there were plenty of interesting cultural things to do in the embassies, museums, theater and music venues but I got lucky and got tuned in by people who had lived there a long time. It's a great area for history buffs. \n\nI think it does have natural beauty, but it is not my favorite landscape. You have to drive out of the DMV metro area to get to the good places, Shenandoah Valley is lovely and the Chesapeake Bay area is great for sailing and it's very historic. It's not a place for people into extreme sports. I prefer the west coast nature and lifestyle myself but I learned to like what was there. \n\nAgree about the power and money obsessed types and they are the majority. It can be highly competitive and stressful in the workplace too especially in government related jobs. I moved there from Austin, TX  where most of my family lives, and yes it was a culture shock.

{"title": "Why I Think AMC Will Result In Bagholders", "selftext": "Alright, this will be quite unpopular, but I don't buy this AMC will squeeze to the moon thesis for a few reasons.\n\nLet\u2019s look at liquidity:\n\nAMC had $813m in cash as of 3/31/21. Since then they\u2019ve raised $428m in fresh capital through share issuance, bringing up their total to $1.241b. This is good except their current cash burn is \\~$300m/qtr which gives them 4 quarters of runway. I do think that as covid goes away completely (possibly by fall) that there\u2019s a chance for this to stabilize. But there are a lot of variables to this such as timeline of opening and attendance rate once we are fully open.\n\nNext there's the valuation:\n\nForget covid and let\u2019s value them assuming everything returns to normal. Average adj. EBITDA between 2018-2019 was $850.3m. EV today using today\u2019s stock price and 3/31/21 debt numbers is $16.1b, which gives us 18.9x EV/adj. EBITDA multiple. For comparison, the same multiple was 6.9x in 2018. So assuming things return perfectly to normal, AMC is still valued 2.7x what it was in 2018. The highest market cap that AMC had previous to this year was in 2017 when its market cap was $4.0b vs. $5.8b today.\n\nConclusion:\n\nAMC is massively overvalued (who knew). Of course, everyone will point out this is a short squeeze opportunity like GME. However, there will probably never be another GME which once had 141% short interest at its peak vs. \\~20% for AMC now. What that means is GME had a legitimate reason for its stock price to completely decouple from its fundamentals, AMC doesn\u2019t, not to quite the extent of GME. There may be some squeezes here and there, but more players will join the short when they see how overvalued AMC is.\n\nThe current buying is predominantly from retail, and the CEO even boasted as much saying retail investors comprise of 80% of the share base. While people think this is a positive, I disagree. There is a reason institutional ownership is low and it means that while the stock price can certainly continue to go up, it will also shoot down just as fast, once everyone begins to exit. With a short interest of 20%, how are 80% of the people going to get out? Who are they going to sell to? In the end, it will just be a shifting of bags amongst the retail.\n\nIf I was the CEO of AMC, this would be the best scenario possible. I can continue to dilute the share base and basically salvage my business which was on the verge of bankruptcy. I don\u2019t doubt that AMC will not hesitate to issue new shares within the next year again unless their liquidity situation improves. It\u2019s also why, I think, they would rather do an at-the-market offering rather than a subscribed offering to institutions.\n\nA lot of people are propping this up as something of a fight for the common people against the hedgies, who have done all the wrong. I actually think this can be quite irresponsible it\u2019s driving people to pour into AMC, basically like a Ponzi scheme.

He definitely did, but things have changed. \n\nWhen Tesla bought bitcoin, and still today a lot today, the common consensus is that about 75% of the hash power is coming from renewable energy. Ark invest said they estimated 76% was from renewables for example. This was largely based on estimates as there is no way to survey every single miner from every country. 3 weeks ago though a huge coal mine in China was shut down for two days because of a flood and stoped shipping coal to power plants in the region. Places powered by coal had black outs and were shut down for 2 days. During this time, the hash rate for bitcoin dropped by 35%. If 35% of bitcoin mining is stoped because of shut down in power plants, then how is it possible hat 75% is renewable, either more and more bitcoin mining is being done by non renewable energy, or those estimates were wrong, and by a significant amount.

Recently I\u2019ve been working on this fascinating piece of TA, and now I am finally ready to share that with [you](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/msv8n1/tbh_i_only_trust_retards/). I am so confident in it, that I dared to put my beard (which I have for five years already) on the line! Worth your full read, I promise! I decided to structure the analysis in the following way: first we'll take a look at the VW short squeeze, revisiting its origins and background as the very first step of the discussion - in order to better understand the fundamental context of TA; after that I'll lay down the main technical parameters and frameworks, through which the [GMESS](https://imgur.com/a/Sd4uE1b) thesis will be dissected, applying all of those to VWSS and explaining the TA core on the Volkswagen example; then, the process will be repeated, but this time TSLASS anatomy will be elaborated upon. Finally, all of the data accumulated in the process, as well as the major findings made, will be applied to the current technical state of GME, in order to construct at least a potential forecast and the probable price action. Buckle up and eat a crayon, let's start.\n\nOh, and one more thing! I really encourage you to dive deep into the ANALysis with me, because the thesis can only be understood if all of the technical factors at play are considered in the sharpest detail first - and then in the aggregate: zooming out and looking at the bigger picture through the prism of coincidences, interdependences and probabilities. Dafaq did I just write? - Dunno, but that's exactly what I meant!\n\n(Not a financial advice, as I am not a professional advisor, just an amateur ANALyzer)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Volkswagen - Das Short-Squeeze: Sep 2007 - Mar 2009\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRemember, when VW became the most valued company in the world for a brief wild period of trading? I bet, Pepperidge apes remember. The squeeze played out right in the midst of the global financial crisis, and such an occurrence was fueled by a curious background scenario, orchestrated largely by one very interesting person. Back then, the former President of Porsche, Wendelin Wiedeking (must be a cousin of Battlefield Counterstrike), was pursuing a goal of taking over Volkswagen. In this process, he used cash-settled options to circumvent the transparency and disclosure of Porsche\u2019s market operations. While being acquired by Porsche, Volkswagen had its ordinary shares premium risen to disproportionately high levels compared to its preference shares.\n\nAs the general public was finding out about Wendysking\u2019s takeover plan, hedge funds and particularly short-sellers set their eyes on the fact that Volkswagen\u2019s preferred shares were traded at a significant discount to the ordinaries (approximately 70%). While the price of the ordinary stock gradually increased, the preferential shares stayed put - and the hedge funds smelt an arbitrage opportunity. They started shorting the stock and buying the preferred shares to profit on the massive divergence. For a moment, there was no news of Porsche continuing its purchase of VW ordinaries from the market, and that fact gave the hedge funds additional confidence. Only to get blindsided, as it turned out later. One shorts-frying weekend, Porsche announced its total holding in VW, cornering the substantial part of the float, and leaving only 6% in free float. In the meantime, short sales had risen to 12% of total stock outstanding. When the market found out that Porsche had acquired 74.1% of the outstanding shares through the in-transparent cash-settled options, VWSS happened - briefly making Volkswagen the largest company in the world, and finally allowing the shorting side to [GUH](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dpnzup/i_recorded_todays_marketopen_and_the_instant/):\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>It was mathematically impossible for every short-seller to buy a share, and therefore close their position. In other words, half the room were going to be left in a burning building with no way out. A panicked dash for the exit began.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2014 A spot on metaphor by Jamie Powell, an FT journalist. Hedge funds are estimated to have lost $20 to $30 billion by betting against VW ordinary stock.\n\nWhat is really ironic (in Palpatine voice) - even though Porsche managed to burn many short sellers, the company couldn\u2019t pay up for the huge positions it had created, and ended up being acquired by VW instead.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3w0ajhk1f2z61.jpg?width=1722&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a4d29a8a0c5ccacfdd193f3e2d5100d0cfdee74b\n\nAlso, interestingly enough, after his departure from Porsche, Wiedeking was charged with market manipulation for his role in the takeover bid. The charges were dropped in July 2016 due to a too little chance of success. Lucking Fegend.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Now let\u2019s take a look at how this epic event was incorporated into the chart:**\n\n[VWSS, Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/d3pfzvb202z61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e497ddf6518faec188269120c44df64ab6cb1791)\n\nEven though it all looks overwhelming from the first glance, don't worry, I'll explain. There are only two major TA instruments used here, namely Fibonacci retracement \ud83c\udf08tool (useful for assessing 'altitude' and the crucial support/resistance levels, check out the in-depth explanation of this TA tool [in my other post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mwevzz/the_big_short_20_why_bears_may_soon_reconsider/)). The second one is the trend based Fibonacci extension for time periods (pink vertical grid with numbers 0, 0.382, 0.618 and so on) - for setting the major time landmarks and zones. Furthermore, you should have noticed the three catchy geometric figures, and the purple line - which is actually a good starting point to unfold the technical thesis.\n\nIn the process of working with VW, TSLA and GME charts, I managed to identify several peculiar characteristics and patterns, that were of an evident nature and have been manifested on all of the three charts, to one degree or another. The most prominent one, in my opinion, is the killer purple resistance/support level. For the current VW example, it is somewhere around $30 mark, or $29.27 if you like precision.\n\nOne may observe on the chart above, that this level is indeed the most significant level through the complete history of VWSS. First, the preliminary to the squeeze major bull run, which solidly accelerated in the middle of September 2007, was held back and repulsed by this level's resistance on the last day of October. It took almost half a year for the price action to catch up to it again in late March 2008. This was followed by a consolidation (with several failed attempts of breakout) just below this level, which lasted for more than 100 days, before the price action finally torn the resistance apart with the powerful gap on the 16th of July '08. And guess what? Even after that, the level played the major supportive role for the price action, with one final retest before the squeeze finally lift off it in the middle of September 2008. You should also make a note of how the price was still magnetized by this level during the final stages of the squeeze. The signifficance of this price level for the whole chart of VW above is difficult to underestimate. Seeing the importance of this level and being a fan of Jimi Hendrix, I decided to name it \"**Purple Haze**\".\n\nLet's inspect the fancy geometric shapes now. These are actually much more reasoned and circumspective than it may seem from the first glance. The first one, in orange, is a cup shaped consolidation (let it be called the \"**Squeezy Grail**\", because why not?) - taking place above 100% Fibo and just below the 'Purple Haze'  - which commenced as soon as this major resistance level had been tested for the first time. It is subsequently followed by the second consolidation of a flatter nature \\[if you know what else is of a flatter nature, comment and if the joke is good enough I may give you an award\\], which again plays around the main $30 level on the chart. The second consolidation, highlighted by the pink rectangle (a.k.a. the \"**Runway**\"), is actually more important than the first one, because here is the point where the paramount breakout happens: the 'Purple Haze' resistance is blew off (in the middle of 0.382 period). Based on that observation, it is also appropriate to assume that in order for the squeeze to initiate, the 'Purple Haze' has to be conquered at some point inside 0.382 Fibo time zone, during the 'Runway' stage. Finally, the triangular \"**Squieezluminati Confirmed**\" part is self explanatory, imho. Oh, just one commentary worth being made here: take a look at how the squeeze itself is proportionate, bipartite, and fits well into the isosceles triangle. The nature surely knows how to play with stonks, too.\n\nEspecially, when we talk about Fibonacci. The horizontal \ud83c\udf08 grid, Fibo retracement, is often used to estimate the possible corrective trend's depth, as well as to identify the key support and resistance levels of it. This one is comfortably applied to the beninging and the apex point of the trend (see the gray dash and dash line on the chart above), and its relevance is subsequently confirmed by how the price action plays around the levels in the triangle. The 12th of September '07 seems to be a good starting point for Fibo retracement application, because on that day another important resistance of $20.72 was penetrated for the first time (then confirmed as support with the beautiful bear trap candle on 23 Jan '08). Furthermore, $20.72 level works like an ideal 100% Fibo retrace level for the current example, and supports the 'Holy Grail' comparable to how my granny supports me. Also, take a note of the 'Purple Haze' being relatively in the middle, in between 78.6% and 100% of Fibo retracement - an important factor that will enable us to apply this retracement to GME later.\n\nNot only the 12th of September fits well as Fibo retracement starting point, it is also a perfect spot to start stretching out the trend-based Fib time grid (TBFTG - to be fucked then go, alternatively). This one is a complex instrument, so take this quick explanation for granted or do your own research in relation to it. Just like Fibo retracement, TBFTG is based on Fibonacci sequence, but this one applies to time periods, instead of the price action and levels. In order to use this instrument properly, it is necessary to identify the preliminary major trend, that will serve as the core measurement for the sequent time periods. Oh, it took me a lot of time to inspect that parameter and to identify those initial pink dash and dash trends, trust me! Tbh, it was one of the most difficult tasks to accomplish in the preparation of this TA. But the result was worth the effort! I noticed the following correlation applicable to both VWSS and TSLASS (and hypothetically to GME too): TBFTG pink dash measurement must involve the major preliminary impulse of the prior main trend, plus 'Squeezy Grail' phase. The staring point of TBFTG is particularly tricky to be identified, and I'm talking about all of the examples, but possible - especially when looking at the TA as a whole, referring to how the grid applies to the price action, and comparing the examples between each other. That is pure rocket science, if you ask me. And most importantly, the TBFTG measurement duration (pink dash and dash trend) seem to be very similar in length to 'Squieezluminati' basis - check the bars measurements on all of the charts (blue lines for VW).\n\nPay attention to the following features, which really help to dissect the squeezes' anatomies and to build the suitable technical framework: *the 'Purple Haze' breakout occurs in 0.382 TBFTG zone; and the squeeze lifts off in the first half of 0.618 zone, peaking at 1*; *TBFTG pink dash measurement includes major preliminary trend plus 'Squeezy Grail', as it has been mentioned above. Furthermore, the correlation in duration of TBFTG measurement and the triangle basis must once again be emphasized.*\n\nNoice, but let's move further.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Tesla, or how Elon Mask truly \u201cis become meme, Destroyer of shorts\u201d: Apr 2019 - Apr 2020\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTesla and the founder Elon Musk have confronted the short sellers on a regular basis, and even after the run-ins with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), for now, the former have been winning. The TSLA shorters were sitting on mark-to-market losses of over $40 billion in late 2020, as the company\u2019s shares exploded 740% last year. This information is based on data collected by Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners, a fin-anal company.\n\nRemember the not so distant in past Tesla 'mania'? The prospects of Tesla\u2019s business and the furious opposition of bulls and bears, including famous fund managers like David Einhorn and Mark Spiegel (who still hold a strong opinion that TSLA is a house of cards ready to collapse), have over the years contributed to an extreme volatility in the stock price. Elon Musk openly criticized the short-sellers and their motivation to dig out and spread negative sentiment about the company. The 'taking Tesla private' play seemed to work out for the short-sellers as the stock price collapsed by about 50% from November 2018 to May 2019. After that, amidst Tesla\u2019s opening of the Shanghai Gigafactory and the announcement of the company's first annual operating profit exceeding analyst expectations, the tables have turned and the bear-beaten TSLA shares skyrocketed in price (not without noble WSBetters help, definitely). Needless to say, that previously steady short-sellers started getting anxious and scrambled to cover their positions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDusaniwsky told Institutional Investor (B2B media) that shorting Tesla is:\n\n>The longest unprofitable short I\u2019ve ever seen!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell, Mr. Dusaniwsky, WSB seem to have an answer for everything:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h3l5hayu02z61.jpg?width=1668&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ecc69df97a282c4a22663e8487cf316488ed9d32\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhile companies and founders often hold a scorn on short sellers, because they can bring down stock prices and cause the cost of capital to rise (or even do worse things, if you know what I mean), Musk\u2019s disdain for the short selling community is unrivaled. In the middle of 2020, Musk took a dig at short sellers by releasing 'short shorts'. These now sell at a premium on Ebay. It's all nice and good, but I have another cool merch idea - '**shortz r fuk**':\n\n[TSLASS, Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/f0qbrpqn22z61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=479c78e6763043f81e9ac2c75cf8a6c769d9eee4)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBeautiful, isn't it? Let's quickly run through the short squeeze anatomy checklist, thoroughly elaborated in the previous TA chapter via the example of VW. First things first, the 'Squeezy Grail' is present, but it resembles more of a V shape structure. Next, the 'Runway' stage is good-looking: a fucking massive gap happened there, and this time 78.6% Fibo level is tested during the 'Runway', being indicative of the TSLA bulls' crazy power. 'Squieezluminati Confirmed' is also really interesting here, as this time there is no isosceles triangle at its core structure, but rather a 'chainsaw'-like volatile price action taking place. Furthermore, you may see that inside of the triangle, there is the after-peak 78.6% Fibo zone retest, which in turn hedl and bounced the price back in the direction of... Moon. Blessed be the bulls!\n\nLooking at the 'Purple Haze' (which is again in between Fibo 78.6% and 100% \\[important!\\]), for TSLASS the major price level manifested at $52.46. During the first half of 2019, this level played a role of a magnetizing support, with the subsequent testing in March and the breakout to the downside in late April. Again, a lengthy, half a year long consolidation is taking place just below this level, and above Fibo 100% retracement. The breakout occurs, you guessed, right in the TBFTG 0.382 zone. And what is really fascinating, is the fact that, after the breakout, the 'Purple Haze' has never been retested. But who knows what the future holds?\n\nAnd the Fibos. The retracement, again, apples perfectly onto the complete squeeze structure: 78.6% is trialed several times; all of the upper levels except for 38.2% were broken with the subsequent retrace and and some with the retest. A particularly intensive price action was occurring for about two weeks near the 23.6% Fibo level, and the high of $189.4 level was penetrated and then touched gently during the initial squeeze. Ah, almost forgot, 100% ($35.75) Fibo level firmly holds the 'Squeezy Grail' in hand again.\n\nCurrent TBFTG should be of an interest for fellow TAnaLyzators too. Particularly, the downtrend, as opposed to VW uptrend, serves as the core for TBFTG's application (again, refer to the dash and dash pinkish line). This core is composed of the pre-'Squeezy Grail' downtrend plus the Grail itself. Take a look at gray measurements, which cover this phase and the triangle duration - again these two follow the tendency of being proportionate in the length as phases. *Crucially, the 'Purple Haze' breakout occurs in 0.382 TBFTG zone again; then one more time the squeeze lifts off in the first half of 0.618 zone, with the false first peak during the final stages of 0.618 and the proper peak at 1*.\n\nToo many coincidences and congruences between the two TA examples discussed above, if you ask me. Especially if the fact that such events happen once in ten years or so is taken into account. Two quotes are of a relevance here:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Coincidences mean you're on the right path - *Simon van Booy*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>If you gaze long enough into an asshole, the asshole will gaze back into you - u/roman_axt\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome additional food for thought from TSLA:\n\n[For redditors with a different floor](https://preview.redd.it/gnd0yienc2z61.jpg?width=1668&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b8b72e1671ad69cf871cde154ae386e52835e94a)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Game stopped, or it is just a beginning?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am absolutely confident that you all know even more than myself about the fundamental factors at play for GME, so I will not bother you here with the background explanation. There is a plenty of good HQ DD all around reddit, so let's jump straight to the sweet sweet TA:\n\n[GMESS, Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/ko1ppnasc2z61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1d3f7c2a78135696d66a0a70e8e2a34ad4a04dbf)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt this point, I feel that a disclaimer is necessary. Let me briefly remind you that this analysis is a thesis, or a hypothesis that has to be proven in the future. I do believe that there is a solid probability for things to play out this way, and my beard supports my manly confidence. However, this is the market, and it all may go another way at any point in time, that's the nature of things! Think critically, learn and do your own DD and TA. In a good memory of u/ControlTheNarrative, at least.\n\nAnd so, it begins. Despite it may seem that there are too many unknown or at least questionable variables for now in this GMESS TA, I believe that I was able to identify the most crucial parameters to build the core of this technical analysis's thesis, since VWSS and TSLASS provided many clues and identifiable characteristics to refer to. The first and most important one is surely the 'Purple Haze'. I should remind you, that this mystically sounding level persistently held back the price for both of the squeeze examples discussed, and only upon the breakout of this level the short squeezes were initiated. For GME this major price level seems to be at about $233 mark, with two intensive tests in Jan and Mar, which proved it to be the most significant resistance on the chart above.\n\nThen, the shapes. The 'Squeezy Grail' (again occurring in between 78.6% and 100%) consolidation is also easily identifiable here, and it is yet again followed by the rectangular 'Runway' consolidation, where the price action currently stands. Remember, how historically (in TSLA and VW) the 'Purple Haze' breakout occurred somewhere near the spot of the current GME price action, in 0.382 Fibo time zone? Well, to paraphrase Ian Fleming: once is (VW) happenstance. Twice is (TSLA) coincidence. Three times is GMenemy action.\n\nFibos. Applying these two instruments to GME was real pain in the ass. Firstly, because the retracement is not usually used as a predictive instrument, being ordinarily applied to the completed trend. But since the situation is not ordinary at all, I played smarter (or more autistic, if you like). Due to the fact that the 'Purple Haze' level was approximately in between 78.6% and 100% Fibo in both of the previous examples, I assumed exactly that to be applicable here too. My belief is firmly backed up by this soft touch of 78.6% by the price action on Jan 28th. And when these two major levels were identified, the Fibo retracement horizontal grid just stretched out on GME itself.\n\nIdentifying the starting points for the trend for both Fibos was the most tricky part. After countless attempts and failures I found what I believe to be the cornerstone to the squeeze:\n\n[Fibos' initiation point zoomed in](https://preview.redd.it/t2ouren1d2z61.jpg?width=1668&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1cd87d96bb42ac20451c86059295f7560c8c44e8)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy? Because this                        \u261d\ufe0f is clearly where the fun started.\n\nAnd now it all matches perfectly. So, I am patiently waiting for the 'Purple Haze' to be broken. And what do you do, fellow retard?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey say, that coincidence doesn't happen a third time.

{"title": "CNBC's Jim Cramer Is So Full of Shit...", "selftext": "Don't ask me why but I often watch Mad Money on CNBC. I also make note of where I got recommendations when I buy stocks, and I'm starting to realize how bad his recommendations often are and how dishonest he is about his bad calls. A few examples:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1) Last night, someone called into to ask about Aeva and he said he couldn't recommend it. Oh really? Actually, HE DID recommend it just several weeks ago. I know because I bought it soon afterwards and it tanked. I understand things change and he's entitled to change his mind but how about at least saying something like, \"I know I recommended this one before, but I can't now because of inflation or whatever...\"\n\n2) XL Fleet. Same story as above. He recommended it, then he didn't and pretended like the earlier recommendation never happened.\n\n3) Tech meltdown. In the runup to the 2020 election, Big Jim was pimping hard for Biden. Okay, fine, everyone's entitled to their opinion. But he kept repeatedly claiming that Biden would great for tech stocks, especially Apple, because he would improve relations with China. This call has been catastrophically wrong, at least so far but no acknowledgment of this whatsoever from him. As a so -called expert, shouldn't he have known that the policies Biden was calling for (huge increase in government spending, massive stimulus checks, enhanced unemployement checks, etc, etc) would cause inflation and inflation would be bad for many of these high multiple tech stocks? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYeah, I know. I shouldn't be taking recommendations from Cramer and other so-called TV experts. That's on me...but I just wanted to add my thoughts here in case others take him seriously.

{"title": "Using data visualizations to identify suspicious behavior on WSB", "selftext": "Note: You can find interactive versions of visualizations for tickers [here](https://www.reddit.com/user/pdwp90/comments/nc9zqz/wsb_audience_graphs/) if you'd like to look deeper into the data, I just did a brief analysis here of the most obvious conclusions.\n\nAs some of you know I\u2019ve been working with data on WallStreetBets discussion for well over a year now, and I wanted to share a visualization I made the combines a few different metrics. The goal was to visualize differences between the holders of different stocks and to try to identify instances of users attempting to manipulate discussion in a bad faith manner.\n\nIn order to do this, I went through ticker by ticker and looked at all accounts who had mentioned the ticker in the last 3 years. I then went through those accounts and looked at a few different metrics. The first thing I looked at was how many days it had been since they had first commented on WSB. I also looked at what proportion of their comments on WSB contained references to the ticker in question. Lastly, I calculated the sentiment of their comments mentioning the ticker.\n\nA visualization of all of those metrics looks something like this:\n\n[GME audience graph](https://preview.redd.it/s6rkc7yke4z61.png?width=2016&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a854d11b0dc90961d39fd191d1c957282861554)\n\nThis makes it quite easy to compare the holders of different stocks, for example we can compare the above visualization for GME with the visualization below for AMD. This provides the immediate and obvious conclusion that fewer newcomers to WSB have been discussing Lisa Su, as evidenced by the more rightward leaning distribution of points along the x-axis.\n\n[AMD audience graph](https://preview.redd.it/spxfexoie4z61.png?width=2016&format=png&auto=webp&s=aaf73292bc2d93feda0a4cfaef0acccb1074f949)\n\nBut it also allows you to identify attempts at manipulating discussion. For example, this large dark dot in the upper left of the GME graph looks rather sus. On a quick hover we can see that one user\u00a0has been talking about GME an awful lot and doesn\u2019t seem to have had very nice things to say.\n\n[Sus](https://preview.redd.it/8gjv0itue4z61.png?width=1732&format=png&auto=webp&s=93f568296f1c6324c18d8f505b4465f142483721)\n\nLooking at their profile, the math seems to check out.\n\n[Their profile](https://preview.redd.it/fkgdsmure4z61.png?width=2144&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e596d35c7b50be174f5f6ca67ea6b5b87d73597)\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that this post isn\u2019t meant to insinuate that there's a ton of people out there exhibiting this type of behavior. On the contrary, accounts like the one shown above were quite rare and if there are people participating in the discussion threads in bad faith, it\u2019s in a less blatantly spammy fashion.\n\nIf there's interest, I will make an anonymized version of these visualizations publicly available.", "id": "nce1jx", "created_utc": 1621013205.0, "score": 469, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 97, "comments": [{"body": "r/dataisbeautiful well done", "score": 106, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.10767125338315964}, {"body": "You should check out the posts about a certain metal masquerading as inflation being pushed by certain users.

So buckle up morons cause the Houston hammer is 7 drinks in and about to learn y\u2019all something.\n\nSome of you idiots may have already seen the numerous DD posts from [/u/Brotherluminous](https://www.reddit.com/u/Brotherluminous/) about some shitty boat company. No, I\u2019m not talking about $CTRM, I\u2019m talking about Canoo ($GOEV), the most shorted electric vehicle company around.

This is a risky fucking play and I\u2019ve lost so much money the past few months my BAC hasn\u2019t dropped below a .15 since the new year. I smoke so much hopium I make Whitney Houston look like the Texas hammer.\n\nBut let\u2019s get to the juice\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**SHORT SQUEEZE**\n\nYeah, yeah, you\u2019ve heard it before. Squeeze this, squoze that, or whatever the fuck. But \u201cnoT eVery sTock Is a ShOrt squEeZE\u201d. You\u2019re right, and nothing will compare to gaymestop, but that doesn\u2019t mean a high SI won\u2019t pump a stock if it starts climbing. And let me tell you shorts are jacked to their tits right now. I\u2019m not good at words so here\u2019s some things someone smarter than me said along with the most recent [Ortex](https://u.teknik.io/32ueS.png) data.\n\n\" Total float is \\~105mm, institutional ownership is \\~6% of total shares (238mm) so about 15mm shares. This theoretically lowers the float to 90mm shares because most institutions will hold long term. So realistically we are looking at >30% of float is shorted. Also keep in mind that the numbers are estimates and this could very well be higher as utilization has also been 100% for a couple weeks now. \" - [/u/Strobe\\_light10](https://www.reddit.com/u/Strobe_light10/)\n\nNumber this, number that, I'm to fucking stoopid to be able to tell you what all this number shit means. But this [website](https://fintel.io/shortSqueeze) has Canoo ranked #2 of companies \"that have the highest likelihood of experiencing a short squeeze\". Okay, that's pure speculation that GOEV claims the 2nd spot because I haven't paid to unlock the rest of the tickers, but GOEV was #1 15 days ago and I assume it's only dropped once by comparing market caps.\n\nDays to cover is also \\~10 days, meaning volume is so low it will take shorts around 10 days with average volume to close their position.\n\nMargin requirements are high but shorts are still doubling down. This WAS a solid move, look at GOEVs chart, but shorts are smart and they\u2019ll quickly abandon their positions once they realize Canoo is a legitimate EV company.\n\n**GAMMA SQUEEZE**\n\nI\u2019m sure a lot of you idiots are familiar with this concept, but for those who aren\u2019t, I\u2019ll explain what\u2019s going on here in a way that you apes can understand without boring you.\n\nSomeone has to write and sell you the FDs that you bought, typically market makers. Market makers will [delta-hedge](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deltahedging.asp) with shares to gain a [delta-neutral](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deltaneutral.asp) position. An option that is OTM won\u2019t be hedged as much as an option that\u2019s ITM. But as the option gets closer to being ITM, market makers need to buy shares to continue being delta-neutral. See where this is going?\n\nAs a stock increases, market makers need to buy more shares to hedge the call options they sold, causing the price to rise more, causing higher strike call options to become ITM, causing market makers to buy more shares to hedge the call options they sold, causing the price to rise more, so on and so forth.\n\nThis is especially volatile for low volume stocks, especially where the number of shares needed to hedge exceeds/is a significant amount of the daily traded volume.\n\n$GOEVs average daily volume traded is 5.3m (although anecdotally I\u2019d say the average for the past month or two has been roughly 2-3m, with days as low as \\~1.5m, like today). Looking at $GOEVs low volume along with the [open interest](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/openinterest.asp) (OI) for the 5/21 OTM call options is where things get insane. For those too lazy to read and don\u2019t know, open interest is the number of options currently open.\n\n\u200b\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|5/21 Strike|Open Interest|\n|:-|:-|\n|10|16481|\n|12.5|6787|\n|15|20273|\n|17.5|7515|\n|20|8164|\n|22.5|16273|\n|25|7868|\n|30|4430|\n|35|7175|\n\n\u200b\n\nNumbers were pulled today at 3:00 HOUSTON TIME\n\n\u200b\n\nIf you don\u2019t know that each option represents 100 shares then you\u2019re a literal moron and belong in this shitty sub. So those 16k 5/21 10c contracts are equivalent to 1.6m shares. When GOEV hits $10, market maker bitches will have to buy 1.6m shares to cover the call options. This is also assuming that market makers haven\u2019t hedged the 10c, which why would they? The stock is shorted to shit and no one expects it to hit $10. And that\u2019s only the 5/21 10c, look at the other strikes. My bet is if this shit hits $10 next week, the damn thing is soaring into the 20s, maybe the 30s.\n\n**EARNINGS REPORT**\n\nThe one and only catalyst for this play; the earnings report happening on 5/17. Last earnings call went to shit and stock price tanked after Tony Tequila opened his big stupid fucking idiot dumb mouth. What this means though is that they\u2019ll want to send some good news our way and save this shitty boat from sinking.\n\nIn all seriousness, I\u2019m a fat Canoo bull long-term after listening to last earnings call, but investors panicked and shorts hopped on the red train. Tony mentioned releasing good news \u201csoon\u201d (manufacturing details among other things) and this could happen during this call.\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\nThis powder keg is ready to explode and all Canoo has to do is give us some good news on 5/17 to ignite the barrel. Quit FOMOing into shit after it\u2019s already popped, and jump on the boat before it leaves the harbor. This is a short-term play with a long-term hodl potential, so calls if you're a ultra giga chad, shares if you're just a chad.\n\n**Pros:**\n\n\\- Short interest is through the fucking roof\n\n\\- Open interest is higher than shit and has created a nice gamma ramp that we can walk to the moon on\n\n\\- Canoo is feeling a lot of pressure from investors to release some good news\n\n\\- GOEV is near its ATL, literally can't go any further down\n\n**Cons:**\n\n\\- This earnings call could be negatively received like the last one\n\n\\- It'll be hard to decide whether to buy a lambo or yacht first\n\nIf you want actual long term hodl DD on Canoo, the crazy motherfuckers on the Canoo subreddit (who are wanting to stalk Tony Aquila's private jet) would be more than happy to tell you why GOEV is a solid investment. For now, all I care about is that this puppy is hitting $30 next week.\n\n**Positions:** My entire portfolio is May/June 10c.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**TL;DR - GOEV first car on the moon**", "id": "ncjpc3", "created_utc": 1621028280.0, "score": 277, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 235, "comments": [{"body": "I was planning on investing $1000 on Monday, but my wife\u2019s told me if I invest any more based on Reddit advice she\u2019s leaving me.

I believe this because the company does not have any earnings to report, so it only makes sense they move the call up this early in Q2 to give good news. The CEO Tony Tequila is an ego maniac and surely wants a \"do over\" after the horrible call in Q1, thus why they choose to give news during the call. Also look for partnership news with ride sharing and/or medium-heavy OEMs. \n\nHowever, contract manufacturing will be on the small end and short term just to get their products to market. The company has $700M cash and their plan is build a factory to produce high volume units themselves. News about this may also be dropped on the call.\n\nWith respect to either contract manufacturing OR in-house factory plans, my crystal ball is vaguely whispering \"Kentucky\" in my ear, but I'm not sure what it means. Screenshot this, make a note, whatever. After the call come back to this comment and beg me to tell you how I knew.\n\nOn the short squeeze stuff, do I expect this to rocket up to $50 a share? No. But it's worth mentioning that the borrow fee is pretty high around 25-29% and has been for months. The past month has been one of the flattest months of trading in the stock's history, so I do suspect shorts will start getting bored and begin to unwind. There is no reason to believe this will cause a squeeze, but it will help get the stock back to a fair market price. \n\nVolume has been DEAD on this stock lately, and seeing that Vanguard picked up 9.5M shares last month literally blows my mind because that's an entire weeks worth of volume. \n\nThere is so much more about this company that is missed because it's so fun and easy to shit all over EV SPACs right now. Short term catalysts aside, building a position here in the $7s is a great opportunity to get in on a long term growth company with great tech. \n\nSo the TL;DR here is I'm expecting good news on Monday, shorts should start to fuck off and the price will recover to a more reasonable range and even if it doesn't, this long term play is worth a look. \n\nPositions:\n\n2200 commons ~10.20s average\n\n3700 warrants\n\n5x 7.50c for May\n\n20x 10c for May (just in case \ud83d\ude09) \n\n5x 20c for Aug", "score": 23, "replies": [{"body": "A fantastic write-up", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.20022058486938477}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.7528260350227356}, {"body": "I have 40k into 40Cs aug that are somewhat totally worthless at this very moment so please be right.
