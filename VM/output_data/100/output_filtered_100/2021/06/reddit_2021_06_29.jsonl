The people who lost their life savings during the 2000 dotcom bubble and the 2008 financial crash were waiting for these opportunity costs too which never came, on at least not until another 5-10 years of waiting and not after they had lost huge portions of their wealth.\n\nThe market is currently at an all time high. Will it keep going up? it might but it is a risk and the higher it goes, the riskier it gets, especially when most investors are predicting an imminent crash. Do you think the market is gonna rise by another 40-50% without coming crashing back down after? Have you seen the ridiculous PE ratios of stocks? Many stocks aren't even making any profits and their share prices are still skyrocketing. This is the typical behaviour you see before a big market crash.\n\nI am happy to stomach some losses but I'm not gonna be stupid to put 100% of my capital into stocks at the moment only to then \"stomach\" 50% losses and not have any cash on hand to buy during the crash.\n\nAt present I've got 50% of my savings in stocks so if the markets push up another 20-30% I'll make gains and then probably sell more stocks to consolidate those gains. If the market crashes 50% then I'll all ready to buy big into the crash even if it's another year or two before it happens because a crash at this point is inevitable, especially if the market rallies up another 40-50%.

Plus you\u2019ll already be in the market and capture those 10 biggest days of the decade which are so crucial to actually having realizable gains. \n\nSo, in summary - your breakeven point for the opportunity cost of holding cash over the last year is 50ish%.

Some areas may generate more electricity than others so you sell from high generation areas to low generation areas) Mix and match renewable sources for maximum success.

Kroger imo the best grocery stock.\n\nHuya/Douyu - streaming is the future, Huya and Douyu individually are bigger than Twitch and they have a better monetization structure. Being Chinese (although not from China) I know how much mainlanders love their eSports and Huya has that sector on lockdown. Imo the death of traditional sport channels in china will be at the hands of Huya but even if they don't, the gaming industry is big in China and is getting bigger. If Douyu and Huya merges, it's practically a monopoly. It's already profitable and the YoY growth is amazing.\n\nEdit: I think all mentioned will be big in 10 years time but I think some of them are extremely overvalued.

{"title": "The FinTech Disrupter that everyone is talking about today, none other than Social Finance, Inc aka $SOFI", "selftext": "I have been saying for about 2-3 weeks that I would do a DD on $SoFi and figured with the increased volume and mentions today, it is time lay out my own bull thesis.  \n\nSoFi was founded in 2011 by Mike Cagney, Dan Macklin, James Finnigan, and Ian Brady, four students who met at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. The founders hoped SoFi could provide more affordable options for those taking on debt to fund their education. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoFi#:~:text=SoFi%20was%20founded%20in%202011,debt%20to%20fund%20their%20education.\n\nI am just a big believer in bringing personal finances to the masses and to teach people about personal finance and how to accumulate and build wealth, most parents and schools don\u2019t teach shit on the subject matter. I absolutely love SoFi's statements/mantras:\n\n- Our number one goal is helping our members get their money right. \n\n- SoFi's mission is to help people reach financial independence to realize their ambitions.\n\nLet's go over some #s.  SoFi has been around and growing as a private company for some time now and has seen seven consecutive quarters of YoY growth w Q1 2021 producing 110% growth and ending w 2.281M members.  This is exponential to say the very least.\n\nI will be linking the data and numbers, but that is all readily available for all the see and find.  The adjusted Net Revenue and EBITDA are increasing and trending in the right direction, with 151% and 70% growth YoY respectively.  The biggest factors to me are they are scaling and accumulating data.  These 2 things are what are going to set companies apart to not only produce growth but obtain profitability to the bottom line. \n\nThe goal of SoFi is to be the one-stop shop for everything a person would need for finance.  Checking/savings accounts, personal loans, home loans, student loans, car loans, budgeting, investing in the markets, and on and on.  The total products used by members has grown by 121% YoY and financial products has grown 273% YoY.  It appears to this layman that they are figuring out to how grow members as well as total products used by member.  https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/sofis-q1-earnings-beat-managements-guidance-as-company-prepares-to-trade-on-nasdaq-2021-05\n\nSoFi acquired Golden Pacific Bancorp Inc in its quest to get a federal bank charter, which is cumbersome and tedious process.  This would be an upcoming catalyst for sure if/when this happens https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/sofi-s-bank-buy-presents-blueprint-for-more-fintech-bank-deals-63129976\n\nThe Galileo acquisition was a game changer and covered well by u/havocs2 in his DD, I would just add that this has seen 130% YoY (everything seems to be growing triple digits) growth as well. https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o9l9x6/why_sofi_will_be_sofly_my_78000_yolo_into_sofi/ \n\n$SoFi was brought to market under the SPAC model and coverage of the stonk has just began.  Coverage was initiated by Oppenheimer w an outperform and was also initiated by Rosenblatt w a buy.  TipRanks has it rated as moderate buy and a price target of $27.50, about a 40% premium to today's closing price.  https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/sofi/forecast\n\nI am not a bot, nor am I a shill.  I am very active (to fucking active to be honest) in the daily and I post almost all my plays in real time.  Check my post history and you can see that I have been in this play for some time and believe in the company.\n\nCurrent positions: 5 $12.50 2023 LEAPS, 2 $20.00 2023 LEAPS, and 155 shares and no intention of dumping or selling short term.\n\nIs there a high SI? is the borrow rate high? Was this targeted because it was a Chamath SPAC?  Probably, i don't know for sure and honestly don't give 2 shits if it is or it is not, I like the company and the stonk and think it is undervalued and will only grow in the future.  That is what the hell I think.  \n\nTo be a FinTech disrupter, you obviously need an app and great user-friendly UI and SoFi has a 4.8 rating w over 48K reviews on the $AAPL app store.\n\nTL;DR There is no industry/s that need more disruption than banks and brokerages.  For far too long the poors and working class have been hit w hidden fees, outrageous fees, shit even made-up accounts.  SoFi is the just the company to do this disrupting all in one beautiful app!\n\nShout out to u/OSRSkarma as he kept pushing to post this.", "id": "o9xjby", "created_utc": 1624928066.0, "score": 1168, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 239, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|9|**First Seen In WSB**|5 months ago\n**Total Comments**|7427|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o9xjby/the_fintech_disrupter_that_everyone_is_talking/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/npdb1j/z_will_disrupt_most_aspects_of_the_industry_that/) \n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4627455472946167}, {"body": "Worth more than double what it's trading for.

Sure there are others that might be better in it\u2019s field, but once this thing gets an FDA approval, it\u2019s \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf1d \ud83e\udd8d\n\nSENS why to buy\n Skip to end to see summary \nCatalyst \n\nSENS CGM system has been remodeled and improved to last 180 days, and is awaiting approval from the FDA. The chances of it being approved are high considering that it\u2019s already being used In Europe. Keep in mind America makes up about 96% of the market share. Due to Covid-19 the approval was pushed back and is thought to be some time around the middle of this year.\n\nThis has caught the eye of institutional buyers as 25% of the stock and 50% of the float is held by institutional buyers. Recently, H.C. Wainwright agreed to buy about 25,974,026 shares at 1.925 per share. Within days the same Hedge Fund agreed to increase the magnitude of their purchase to 51,948,052 shares at the same price. The total value of the purchase is exactly 100 million dollars. Then on January 21st, it was bought deal valuing the total purchase at 115 million\n\nSENS has 14 patents all relating to the design and specific parts of their CGM system\n\nThe way a normal CGM system works is a tiny sensor with a needle is inserted under your skin and then it measures your glucose levels while lasting up to 7-14 days. Twice a day you need to check the CGM system itself by pricking your finger and inserting a drop of blood. You also need to replace the CGM sensor every 3-7 days which requires you to remove the entire device. \n\nThe Percentage of Americans with type 1 diabetes that use a CGM is now on an exponential growth curve rising from 12% in 2014 to 24% in 2016 to 38% in 2018 \n\nThe general market concentration has about 4 major players\nDexcom, Abbott, Medtronic, and Senseonics. So this market is extremely concentrated\n\nOut of all the other companies that are solely devoted to the design and manufacturing of CgM devices there are 26 competitors , however Senseonics has received the most funding at 143.4 million.\n\nAlso the main subject behind the majority of their patents is analytical chemistry, analytical chemistry is the science of obtaining, processing, and communicating information about the composition and structure of matter. In other words, it is the art and science of determining what matter is and how much of it exists.\n\nAnd while yes this field is being used to separate and measure the glucose levels within the human Body, this field is very wide and offers a wide selection of possible futures, once revenue increases. \n\n\n\nOut of the past 4 quarters SENS has beat revenue expectations 3 times and beat EPS estimates twice.\n\n\n\n\nContinuous Glucose Monitoring Market \n\n-Current market dynamics and growth opportunities\n-Technological advances on the market \n-Strategies and different product innovations for major players \n\nTwo things make up the CGM market, the components used and the geographical location of the company \n\n\nMARKET DRIVERS\n\nSurge in diabetic population\n-205.47 million people suffer from diabetes in China and India\n-20 million had type 1 diabetes\n****\nAmerica:\n-2.7 million Americans have type 1 diabetes \n-32.3 million Americans have type 2 diabetes\n-Diabetics have a 300% increased risk of being hospitalized, thus increasing expenses or cautionary measures\n-In developed countries close to 90% of type 1 diabetes patients use glucose meters, 50% of type 2 may also use glucose meters\n\nWith increasing awareness among the type 2 diabetes patients, demand for CGM devices has been rising at a rapid pace \n\nIn 2016 there were about 321 million people with diabetes, by 2020 the number has increased about ten percent to 361 million. \n\n2017 Increased 2.18 percent \n2018 Increased 3.96 percent \n2019 Increased 2.93 percent \n2020 Increased 2.84 percent \n\n\n\nSENSORS\nEversense CGM System, an implantable glucose sensor by Senseonics Incorporated was launched in 2018. The advantage of Eversense CGM System is that it can remain in place for up to three months, where the other CGMs sensors remain in place for up to 3-10 days.\n\nMARKET SEGMENT\nMedical devices occupied 27.7% of the share in 2020\n\nBetween 2018 and 2020, Senseonic generated a meager $8.3 million in product revenue. It cannot manage to break even in terms of gross margin. Since its inception in 1996, the company has lost $648.5 million. Before its $175 million equity infusion in Q1 2021, the company had just $35.9 million in assets to offset $177.2 million in liabilities.\nPossible downsides: \nIts peers, such as Abbott Laboratories (NYSE: ABT), Dexcom, and Medtronic (NYSE: MDT), are all better capitalized and farther ahead in their technology. By the time Senseonic launches Eversense 365, its competitors will likely have moved on to seventh or eighth-generation CGMs. It's typically not a good idea to go long on stocks of a healthcare company that can only play catch-up. \n\n\nSummary: As an investor I typically like to follow Socially Responsible Investing/ Value Investing. Looking at the companies free cash flow/ ebitda ratio shows that they are in a good position to grow, along with pending FDA approval for their 180 day CGM device. Also considering majority of diabetics have said they would prefer this over the dexcomm CGM device it shows promise. Overall I believe SENS can have great enterprise value and wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see it trading around 30 dollars EOY. \n\n\nDisclaimer: Normally I Buy a stock within 10-15% of a 52 week low that\u2019s shown itself to offer some price support. If in this case it breaks to a new low, cut losses.\nAlso look into rare birds, asset plays, to a lesser extent, arbitrage opportunities and companies selling at less than two thirds of net value (net working capital less liabilities). So I am breaking my usual buying pattern.\nI am also buying an additional 50,000 shares, currently holding 10,000", "score": 0, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.24041084945201874}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.18873830139636993}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.13462677597999573}, {"body": "This my whole portfolio \ud83e\udd23", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1583840548992157}, {"body": "I read on a random website, looking up shorted stocks.

{"title": "How to DD/Analyse a Stock", "selftext": " Aight blokes gather around. If youre sick of getting Motley Fooled give this a crack\n\nThis is how I DD a stock, so hopefully, new investors won't get fooled into pump-and-dumps. There's obviously a lot of ways to do your due diligence on a stock, I think the most important thing is having a process and not relying on trash articles, or your mates tips :|\n\nMy Stock DD Checklist Summary\n\nAre you sick of getting *Fooled* into terrible stocks? Stock DD or Due Diligence is probs the most important step in investing. So do your DD and don't COP a Pump and Dump.\n\n**Step One: Identify the Stonk**\n\nThe first step to a stock DD is obviously finding a stonk to DD. This could be a recommendation from your dodgy mate, or maybe you got Motley *Fooled* *.* The important thing to note here is the intent of the source that is mentioning the stock. Do they have a vested interest? Are they tryna pull a Jordan Belford on ya? What is their motive behind mentioning the stock?\n\nFor these reasons, it may be a good idea to identify your own stock. Have a think about companies that you interact with and see if they are publicly traded. Or browse through the listings. Although these strategies are honestly slow and probs trash you can be sure there\u2019s no altera motive.\n\n**Step Two: Understand the Company. Know the Stonk**\n\nThis is an extension on the phrase don\u2019t invest in something you don\u2019t understand. The same goes for individual stocks, it\u2019s probably not a good idea to invest in a company if you don\u2019t even know what they do PROBABLY?\n\n1. Search the Businesses \u2018About Us\u2019 Section\n\nPretty much all listed companies will have a webpage with an \u2018about us\u2019 section browsing this and their website can be a good starting point to understanding their business, and a good start to a stock DD. See if their website is trash while ur there.\n\n2. Use Simply wall st and Read the Company Profile\n\nSWS is decent for listed stocks, it has a Company Overview section for every stock which gives a quick synopsis (Synopsis: a bRiEf suMmaRy oR gEneRal SurVEy Of SoMEThinG) about the business and what they do.\n\nHow Much Do I Need To know?\n\nPeter Lynch \u201cNever invest in an idea you can\u2019t illustrate with a crayon.\u201d As a starting point you should be able to answer at least these four questions, and probs be able to use a crayon;\n\n1. What sector is the company in?\n2. What does the company do?\n3. How does the company make money?\n4. How long has the company been around?\n\n**Step Three: What is their Market Cap**\n\nA company\u2019s market capitalization or (Market Cap: if you didn't know) is how much the stock market determines a company is worth. it is calculated by the total market value of all outstanding shares. These are Large, mid and small cap.\n\nEach category can be a good investment strategy it's just important to note that each group has different companies at varying levels of maturity. You shouldn't buy a micro-cap and be surprised if it gets delisted instead of paying dividends. Likewise, you probably shouldn't buy a Bluechip and hope they go to the moon.\n\n**Step Four: Screening Software for Stock Analysis**\n\nThere are a lot of websites and tools available to screen the selected stocks, Here's what i use:\n\n**Trading View** great\n\n**Yahoo Finance** ehhh\n\n**Simply Wall St** decent, (lots of nice Pics if u cant read)\n\n**What are we looking for?**\n\nAfter picking some of these tools that works well for you, perform a basic fundamental analysis on the stock. Looking for any red flags:\n\n**Earnings Per Share (EPS):** Positive? Growing over time? Earning?????\n\n**Price to Earnings Ratio (PE):**\n\n* PE 0/NA: *The company has no earnings*\n* PE 1-14: *The company is undervalued/has low investor sentiment regarding growth*\n* PE 15-20: *Average*\n* PE 20+: *The company is overvalued/has high investor sentiment regarding growth*\n\n**Book Value/share:** The book value is the net assets of a business divided by the number of shares on issue.\n\n**Debt:** A company should have more assets than liabilities to avoid bankruptcy. We like companies with low-to-no debt. If a company has debt, ensure it is well covered by assets and earnings\n\n**Return on Equity (ROE):**\n\nHigher ROE = The better the company are at making money from equity and vice versa.\n\nWe like companies with consistently higher ROE over 10. A low ROE means low growth potential.\n\n**Past Performance:** We all know 'past performance is not indicative of future returns' but it can pay to have a quick look at the stock chart. If its going up that means money\n\n**Step Five: Financials**\n\nfind the companies latest Yearly or Half-Yearly report. Analyse its Income Statement, Balance Sheet and Cash flow statement.\n\n**Step Six: Cap Raise! Dilution**\n\nTherse nothing more frustrating than seeing your share getting hit with Cap Raise after Cap Raise and seeing your shares diluted to nothing. We all had that feeling when they halt and release another supplementary prospectus. FML. One easy sign that a company is constantly raising capital is through looking at it's share price and number of shares on issue. IF SP is rly low and number of shares is rly high then they're probs cap raising 24/7.\n\nWe can also use the financials we read before to try and predict if the company is adequately capitalised.\n\nA capital raise is not necessarily a red flag, but be wary and sucks to see all those trading haults.\n\n**Step Seven: Buy Sell Ratios and Volume**\n\nSee if there are a healthy number of buyers and sellers and decent trading volumes. The best way to do this is using your trading platforms. If you're wanting to sell there's got to be someone to buy the trash off you.\n\n**Step Eight: Prospects**\n\nWhen examining a company for your stock DD we should consider its macro and microeconomic factors. Notably regulation and future industry outlook and disruption. Are they gonna be the NExt Blockbuster? Is the gov gonna screw u over?\n\n**Step Nine: Competition**\n\ncompare the stock to it's direct competitors. To do this we are going to go back to step four and compare the company's fundamentals against its competitors. If the competitors are better then why not buy them instead?\n\nDo they have an economic moat?\n\n\\----------------------------------------------\n\n***There are five types of generally accepted economic moat******s****;*\n\n1. ***Low-cost production;***  *Companies that can keep their prices low can maintain market share and discourage competition*\n2. ***High switching costs;*** *Customers and suppliers might be less likely to change companies or providers if the move will incur monetary costs, time delays, or extra effort. e.g. banks and power providers*\n3. ***Network effects;*** \u00a0*network effect happens when the \u201cvalue of a good or service grows\u201d as its used by existing and new customers e.g. Amazon is an excellent example*\n4. ***Intangible assets;*** *Brand identity, patents, and government licenses are examples of intangible assets. e.g. think Nike or Coca-Cola as an excellent brand and think of the government regulation surrounding gamble and the moat this creates for gambling companies.*\n5. ***Efficient scale.*** *Companies that have a\u00a0natural monopoly\u00a0\u2013 or operate in markets or industries where there are few rivals*\n\n*One thing to consider about an economic moat is they\u2019re largely priced into a stock share price as they often relate to profits. For example Coca-Cola has an excellent brand and due to that sells more products and creates more profits. As such these factors will often be indirectly accounted for in Quantitate Analysis but it can be helpful to identify businesses with and without these moats.*\n\n\\------------------------------------------------\n\n**Step Ten: Insider Ownership and Management**\n\n**Insider Ownership:** We generally like companies with large insider ownership. This is big for small cap companies. Skin in the game helps ensure the management's motives are in line with ours. U can use Simple wall St (Swear i dont work witt them, just like their stuff) which shows Insider Ownership and Trading easily. We like small cap stocks with \\~30% insider ownership and history of owners buying on market. For large cap companies' insider ownership will be lower, 3-5% would be decent in this case. It wont be much for large caps u clearly wont see Bill G coppin 30% of Micros any time soon.\n\n**Are management buying or selling large amounts of shares?** Sudden large selling by management for no apparent reason may hint that management believes the company is overvalued or peaked at that point in time.\n\n**Management Experience:** Consider educational and professional backgrounds. One of the most important factors is their experience in the industry. Their reputation is also key. What goals has the management set out for the company? Have the leaders had successful projects in the past, or did they fail?\n\n One case study of management is the affect that Elon Musk has had on tesla.  \n\n**Bonus Step: Speccies are Sentiment and Hype**\n\nAfter going through every step and doing a thorough DD, it's important to mention that the market is unpredictable trash. Even with the most advanced analyses, speccies are just sentiment and hype. By every stretch of fundamental analysis, they are trash stonks, that doesn't mean you can't make money off them. Just be ready for the pump-and-dump!\n\n(reposted w/ a bit more info. Also had to remove all the links to the SWS and trading and stuff bc the subreredit didnt like. I got nothign to do with them. I just like their stuff)\n\nCheers for reading blokes. Hoepfully this saves at least someone from getting Motely Fooled into trash\n\n\n\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 TLDR\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\nMotley fool is Trash.Maybe know the name of a company before YOLOing your life saving into it....

This is not looking to me like anything big is going to happen currently with this stock and the more that borrow fee goes down the less likely it will. You're just not getting enough volume. There is also currently as of today 2mil shares to borrow. shorters usually take stocks like these to pound town starting on thursday all the way to EOD friday, so they can push as many calls out of the money as possible. They're def going to take the hit and pay those borrow fee rates of 140% to keep it off of $20. It's going to be rejecting there super hard.

{"title": "Unlocking the Recipe for Tendies - An Investigation from Walmart to Wallstreet", "selftext": "Daddy's home with your Christmas and birthday gifts for the next 20 years combined. He's been working his ass off for weeks of 100h+ to make you the DD of the year. If you want the Lambo read the DD if you want the bus, skip the DD\n\n# Why is TTCF about to devour the food industry?\n\nEven if I, and probably tons of you, are beef eaters rather than grass enjoyers, it's estimated that a 100m degenerated in the US right now that are interested in plant-based foods, but there hasn't been enough innovation within their sector to really fulfill their needs. The food industry is dominated by the same companies since the 1950s. However, we've seen starting to disrupt this sector. We want to invest in this innovation, in a way that gives a high probability of great returns. Here comes the most undervalued company in this sector, TTCF and likely in the whole market.\n\nBy disrupting the market, TTCF is not competing with anyone right now, they are creating their own market. They are not competing in the plant-based meat category, they are creating a whole array of plant-based foods, but most importantly, products that customers actually like. This is pioneering at its best. I can already hear you saying: oK bUt wHaT aBoUt BYND? Beyond Meat only produces plant-based meat. TTCF has a whole range of plant-based MEALS, like a ratatouille that tastes better than R\u00e9mi's and ready in minutes, cauliflower mac & cheese, etc. They have products for everyone. Your average fitness girl that eats her A\u00e7ai Bowl like a hipster, your risotto for your date night, a pizza for a Football Match. You get the idea.\n\nThese guys source all their vegetables from their fields in fucking Italy to get you the best possible Pomodoro on the whole damn planet.\n\nI like the product but who gives a shit, here are reviews from a vast array of different people so you can make your mind on what most folks think about their products\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kt\\_Is3mz5mo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kt_Is3mz5mo)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a47Vjbk\\_94I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a47Vjbk_94I)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWyRC8E7BpA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWyRC8E7BpA)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPMGQH4hYH0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPMGQH4hYH0)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovRiuL3XMzI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovRiuL3XMzI)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXU2el\\_AcbQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXU2el_AcbQ)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z1ZLfRoGaE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z1ZLfRoGaE)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you don't trust the reviews and think it's all the same person, then look at this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pmvnpjgcm7871.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=15be2b9f4dc5348ba205544a7e274c93fe1f5a56\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/23rsis6dm7871.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9293147f082192f3729df9bcf7e73d89d8650387\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe sell-through is ridiculous, I have more pictures of empty shelves than photos with my parents. The lucky few who discovered TTCF LOVE the product, there's no doubt about that, but most folks haven't heard of TTCF yet. TTCF hasn't even spent a dime on marketing yet. They've only started their first advertising campaign this quarter!\n\nWe know from Walmart data, that people who have tried the product are coming back without any ads. I can guarantee you that this is pretty rare in the food industry. We are witnessing a beast in the making. They are even expanding in the Mexican food industry. Look at the reviews by yourself, they are going to eat Chipotle alive ($42 bn food giant) without a sweat.\n\nNow that they will start marketing, this is going to supercharge sales. Their recent acquisition will allow them to ramp up production and meet this demand.\n\n**TTCF Expansion**\n\nThe growth they have is just insane and historical in this industry. They achieved these results without spending a dime in marketing.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9a4wi21fm7871.png?width=2339&format=png&auto=webp&s=778a1f7d5d7f0a0c7354702400de3636b73e62b0\n\nThey've been conservative on their targets and have always beaten their revenue expectation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey are vertically integrated. For the toddlers in the back that have no idea what I'm talking about, it means they own the whole damn supply chain. From the vegetables all the way to the final product. They are constantly increasing capacity to be able to meet demand. This enables TTCF to munch on inflation, as they don't have suppliers.\n\nEssentially, this will guarantee rock-solid margins once they slow down their growth and focus on profitability. This also means they'll be able to diversify out of frozen food. TTCF is super cash-rich with not debt! Other acquisitions are likely to come, increasing their domination in the industry.\n\nKeep in mind that TTCF is only selling in the US for now. They are going to be growing even faster, once they start expanding in Europe and the rest of the world.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Valuation\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0j3v5uoam7871.png?width=807&format=png&auto=webp&s=a8e58c8f679372a8d544ded9fcdf56a10e5ea70c\n\nTTCF has more growth and trades at a much lower multiple than its peers. And I've taken the analyst's estimates for 2022 and 2023, but these are rookie numbers and they are very likely to beat them. Indeed, this dumb-ass analyst forgot to do his job and price the catalysts, as explained below.\n\nTTCF is worth about 6 times less than BYND, for example,  but has more growth and trades at a lower multiple. You're essentially getting a BYND but for one-sixth of the price. But most importantly, their products taste 1000x better.\n\nThe day TTCF really ramps up marketing and starts doing partnerships with famous people, they'll be trading at a much higher EV/Sales ratio. Just like OTLY with Oprah.\n\nUnlike many other companies on this list, TTCF is not burning cash like there's no tomorrow, and is almost profitable, putting them in a strong position to continue to acquire new companies.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Unpriced News and Catalysts\n\nThis is where it gets interesting, and for once you have a real hedge. A lot of positive information has not been priced yet, as only 2 analysts are covering the stock. Even on my company's freaking expensive Bloomberg Terminal, there's almost no analysis of the stock. Just Google any of the following catalysts, you'll find nothing. Fortunately for you, I've been following this stock for longer than your wife's had a boyfriend, and this is what I found.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hsopapyfm7871.png?width=677&format=png&auto=webp&s=3091465438015baa2d2d7a16833322e52576eb6d\n\n**Target Revenue Coming in:**\n\nTHE HISTORY OF TARGET! It gets even better. They only launched Target products on March 15^(th). This means that last quarter didn't account for Target's revenue. I had to read their 120 - pages long 10-K 5 times, in order to find that. Of course, there is no way that these two garbage analysts read that.\n\nAnalysts expect TTCF to do 54m this quarter, which is only 1m more than they did in Q1. There is absolutely no way, literally impossible that TTCF doesn't beat these numbers by at least 10m, bare minimum. With a nationwide Target presence, these numbers are a piece of cake to beat. On earnings day this could easily pop 15%.\n\n**Kroger Leaked Website:**\n\nOn Friday, I was doing a list of all company's selling TTCF products, I noticed a glitch on Kroger's. I entered a specific query in their engine. I  saw a page containing TTCF products, but no announcement was made yet! This is huge. No one has seen that. Considering this is such a big deal. When these two sleepy analysts and the hedgies find this out (any time now), you can expect a very large green dildo. It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, suits will soon wake up. You either eat them now or they'll rob you tomorrow. If they have the same success as in Target, my god they're gonna destroy their estimates. The stock could easily rise 10% on the day investors learn this.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z7hbugogm7871.png?width=1913&format=png&auto=webp&s=b1e17a53b512db9a7f1ec99cc62bedd3eb987ab6\n\n**Russel 3k and 2k:**\n\nLast Friday at the close, TTCF got added into the Russel 3000 and Russel 2000. This will increase awareness of the stock in Wallstreet and most likely prop up prices thanks to passive index tracking.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uzpyd3p8x7871.jpg?width=488&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=44d38ebc4bbb0c8ae49c115a83ce46444f192ca8\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Price Targets and Outlook\n\nI've been in the market for years and have never seen a stock like this. Considering all the unpriced information, this stock can conservatively hit **$40+** once people find out about Kroger and how ridiculously low the revenue estimates are. **$50+** after earnings, minimum.\n\nA **$100+** is not a stretch. This is stock is a hidden gem.\n\nYou can play it like a degenerate gambler and buy calls, but I'd recommend buying shares. Again, I don't care, but do me a favor and buy one share so you'll be able to tell your children you were a shareholder. You'll thank me later\n\n**Positions:**\n\n30k in Aug/Jul Calls\n\n1650 shares\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL:DR**\n\nVegan apes strong together. Have you ever dreamt of a stock where you have more information that even hedgies don't have?  Numerous unpriced catalysts? Ludicrous growth? At a cheap price? Here is TTCF saying yes to all these questions! Bus or Lambo, it is up to you\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Positions and meme\n\nSources:\n\n[https://www.kroger.com/p/tattooed-chef-plant-based-burrito-bowl-frozen-meal/0085001598228?fulfillment=PICKUP](https://www.kroger.com/p/tattooed-chef-plant-based-burrito-bowl-frozen-meal/0085001598228?fulfillment=PICKUP)\n\n[https://content.ftserussell.com/sites/default/files/russell\\_3000\\_index\\_additions\\_-\\_2021.pdf](https://content.ftserussell.com/sites/default/files/russell_3000_index_additions_-_2021.pdf)\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TTCF/analysis?p=TTCF](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TTCF/analysis?p=TTCF)", "id": "oa8p0o", "created_utc": 1624974673.0, "score": 666, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 144, "comments": [{"body": "This looks like classic WSB DD Im in for 600 shares!

Empty shelves don't mean a thing right now other than they didn't get restocked.\n\nI appreciate all the work that went into this DD, and I didn't read all of it, but this feels like too much hype. Almost like hype from an insider. Where did the Walmart sales info come from?\n\nI really can't help but poke holes in some of this overly enthusiastic DD. The graphic says 200k sq ft of manufacturing space. That's a pretty good size production facility, but probably just one. Or maybe two medium sized facilities. That sure didn't sound like \"vertically integrated\".\n\nAdditionally, vertically integrated doesn't necessarily mean immune to inflation. Inflation right now and forecasted for the food industry isn't because suppliers are getting greedy, it's labor shortages, production capacity limitations, environmental factors, etc. Being vertically integrated just means that the suppliers' headwinds are your headwinds, too. It can cut out a lot of costs, but it can also trap a company into a lot of fixed costs that they might not have otherwise. You expect me to believe that they're sourcing tomatoes from Italy, but also that they are vertically integrated? They own the pomodori fields in Italy? Sounds expensive. I've been there. I've seen how \"insurance companies\" operate there. And even with vertical integration, the food industry operates on thin margins. I don't see this being the Tesla of the food industry.\n\nAs far as expanding outside of frozen, that's going to either take serious build out or acquisition. Not that I don't think they can do that, but the costs of integrating an acquired company are significant and they often drag on for a significant amount of time, could be years. Acquisition means taking on additional marketing teams, R&D teams, QA teams, warehousing, etc, and then you have to trim the fat. Build out means you have to build those teams from the ground up. A factory that makes frozen meals is not going to also do bottles sauces. Likewise with R&D teams.\n\nThis really doesn't feel industry disrupting either. So it's plant based meals. These aren't cutting edge science meat analogues. These don't look like they are trying to mimic whole muscle chicken made from pea protein or something like that. They're making good, veggie-based meals. It's not something that someone else can't come in and do. Other than branding, there's not much stopping anyone else from coming in and doing their private label version of these. \n\nAll in all, I don't see this mooning. Sorry.
