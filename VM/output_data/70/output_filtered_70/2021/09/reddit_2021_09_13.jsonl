And there is a massive backlog coming, but I don't think it means what OP thinks.  *Maybe* this plays out in some states, but where I live, if you think the government can adjudicate, process, and enforce enough foreclosures to outpace sales then you're retarted- and not in the endearing way we use the term.\n\nYes, there will be foreclosures.  It may slow price increases but I don't see more than that.  There is no way foreclosures can be processed fast enough to see a repeat of the '08 crash.  It can be a very lengthily process causing small #'s of homes to be dumped into a market with unprecedented demand.\n\nFor a real crash in real estate to occur the price declines will have to be large enough to wipe out equity because that's what causes the feedback loop that brings prices down more.  For new originations they're not playing as fast and loose as they did in the early 00's.  So I don't think it's the new mortgages that go tits up.\n\nWith HELOC's it may be a little different.  It seems like everyone I know has been tapping into their home equity.  That's a bit of a red flag, but still not like '08 when there were tons of people who never even made their first mortgage payment.
