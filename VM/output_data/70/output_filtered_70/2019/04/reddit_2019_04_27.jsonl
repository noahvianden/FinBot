At best, that is a guess.\n\nModel S and Model X vehicles are typically priced in the 80,000 $US to 100,000 $US range, and that can easily go up to 120,000 to 130,000 $US range for Performance variants.\n\n**For customers in this price range (very affluent), a decline of 3,750 $US in the American federal government tax credit is insubstantial.**  For an 81,000 $US Model S 75D (now discontinued and replaced by the \"Standard Range\" Model S), the reduction in tax credit would have amounted to 4.6% of the purchase price.  For someone paying 120,000 $US for a Model S P100D, the reduction in tax credit amounts to just 3.1% of the purchase price.\n\nThe decline in tax credit is far more relevant to Model 3 customers.  For the 45,000 $US midrange version, the reduction in tax credit represented 8.33% of the vehicle price.  People buying cars in the 40-50k $US price range are far more price sensitive than those buying cars in the 80-120k $US price range.\n\nTo conclude: 3,750 $US is pocket change to rich people in the United States.
