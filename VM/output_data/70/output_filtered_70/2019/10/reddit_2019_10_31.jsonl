It's why we go balls deep in FDs before an earnings call.\n\nJust like in 2008, the fundamentals of this economy are different than they were when he began his reign at the fed in the late 80's.  During his tenure, we did not have near 0% interest rates with low inflation.  We also didn't have other stable countries with negative interest rates.
