{"title": "Surviving the Boeing crash", "selftext": "A Boeing plane crashed this weekend. Unfortunately, I was short seven BA strangles. The most relevant strikes\n\n3 March 360 puts, 1 March 400 put\n\n3 April 360 puts\n\nWhen the market opened BA down about 12 percent, my account down about 3 percent. My BA delta about 250. Yikes. I was close to delta neutral on Friday and that has been my idea.\n\nAbout 20 minutes into trading I cover the March 400 put for a monumental loss. Normally I close when the strike gets breached. I also closed 2 of the March 360s and 2 April 360s. At this point BA was about 379, my delta now about 45, which I saw as manageable.\n\nObviously that did not work out so well, because I covered sold puts at 379 and BA closed at 400. Still, there is a benefit to acting mechanically when faced with a three standard deviation move. The alternatives are to abandon the plan, to freeze, perhaps jeopardize the entire account.\n\nI ended the day down 1.5 percent, long about 15 delta on BA  BA wasn't the only fire to put out. The huge rally pressured sold calls on other underlyings. With hindsight, it would have been better in this case to wait. But that wasn't the plan, and I had way too much risk after the gap. \n\nI always tell people to follow their plan. Altering the plan after a huge move on news tends to be a terrible idea. The result might boil down to a coin flip, but the long term damage from abandoning the plan is large.\n\nIf, God forbid a third plane crashes, BA might be gap down another 60 points in a blink. Yes, a low probability event, but not exactly a zero probability one given the circumstances.\n\nRule number one is: live to trade another day. Down 1.5 percent on a three standard deviation move where I have a substantial position, means that I can move on.", "id": "b03hv7", "created_utc": 1552364931.0, "score": 176, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 75, "comments": [{"body": "Quite the title.", "score": 219, "replies": [{"body": "I had to triple check what sub this was on because of that title ", "score": 92, "replies": [{"body": "MCAS driving that BA nose right into the ground.

The first decision to roll the calls on the gap down depends on the premium you got for the strangle, or rather breakeven. Let's say it was $10. Roll down to 370 or a strike ITM (365). Assume you get another $4, our breakeven is at 385. Your inverted strangle is $30 wide, so you have halved your potential loss already, if it stays between 370 and 400.\n\nWE ARE NOT TRYING TO TURN A PROFIT HERE. Merely minimizing the loss.\n\nFrom here, 2 scenarios. If it floats in that range and the IV is still good, roll it out to the next month as an inverted strangle around 15-25 DTE. I don't roll out inverted positions 2 times, that's a one-time move, then close in the next cycle with all adjustments and call it a day.\n\nIf it starts whipping you around, it becomes more of a personal preference and position complexity. E.g. my positions may have 5 layers at different strikes, so it can be easier for me to buy/sell stock (or underlying future contracts in my case) rather than send 5 adjustment orders.\n\nSo let's assume it rallies back to 400 now. Roll the put higher to be ATM/ITM 1 strike again. Yes, it makes the inverted strangle wider, but you are still working on reducing the negative impact, it's better than watch it run away from you.\n\nWhen you start getting concerned with deep ITM liquidity, buy/sell stock. How many? As many as needed to bring your delta back in line for the position. E.g. if you had a +1000 before the gap, keep buying stock to neutralize the negative deltas from the position. Yes, the timing sucks, buying into the rally, but what's the alternative? Watch it become -2000 delta position? -4000? Be ruthless and detached.\n\nAs BA moves up and down you may want to add/remove stock position as needed.\n\nAlso, it's so much easier when you have a chance to follow the strike price gradually rather than deal with a gap down/up, but.. shiiit happens.
