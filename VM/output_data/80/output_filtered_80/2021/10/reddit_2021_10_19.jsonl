In order to better understand my question let me actually give you an example.\n\nLet's say that I bought 1 stock from Amazon in 21 October 2016 for the price of 819$ and I decide to sell it now and the current price is 3435$ which means that I made a profit of 2616$. If we look at the history of Amazon the stock price tends to go up all the time. In this case what am I supposed to do? If I decide to buy an Amazon stock in let's say 3 months the price will probably be higher than 3500$ so how can I then make a profit?\n\nSo this is my question, what strategy to use in order to be able to save some money for myself and at the same time to be able to re invest? I am talking about for example few hundred of dollars worth saving and at the same time having enough money to buy other stocks.

Once that breakout happens sell and move on bcs what goes up will come down to some degree. Set a trailing stop loss/ take profit and let the trade take its course. It will protect you and get you max. Profit if entered correctly. Meaning set a take profit of 1-2% below the highest price when reached following the reports release (or whatever you\u2019re comfortable with) and set your stop less right at or slightly below the more prevalent support level and get after it.

I typically spend 30% of my paycheck on things I need, giving money to my parents.\n\n30% to invest - I only make buys when it hits fair value or less.\n\nLast 30% I save to build up some rainy day funds (gonna do this till I have 6 months of savings if I lose my job. Once I've hit this goal, I'll channel most, if not all of this 30% into my broker). So this is what I do for saving money. \n\nNow, diving into \"growing one's wealth through investing\"\n\nThe strategy to investing and growing one's wealth is very simple, but not everyone's willing to put in the time and effort to read each company's quarterly earnings transcript and dissect every single thing.\n\nTo find out any company's earnings transcript, Google \"(company name) investor relations\", click on quarterly reports, press releases, etc. explore and have fun! \n\nLet's use AMZN as an example. Do you follow their earnings call (EC) every quarter? Are they in talks about developing a new product/ service?\nhttps://ir.aboutamazon.com/quarterly-results/default.aspx\n\nLet's dial back to when they were still doing e-commerce only. Were there signs that they were considering to move into providing cloud services (i.e. AWS) from their EC?\n\nI didn't dig into AMZN's EC back into the years leading up to its launch in 2006 cuz I don't think there was motley fool or seeking alpha back then, but I might be wrong.\n2006 share price: ~$30.\nAnyway, I found this 2016 article (https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/02/andy-jassys-brief-history-of-the-genesis-of-aws/amp/) where there were talks about launching AWS back in 2000s. Key here was to understand their objective and whether there was a market demand for the product. Those who did made big bucks.\n\nThere was also some news going on and about in 2013 (2013 share price ~$350) about how AWS would be their core business moving forward (https://techcrunch.com/2013/11/13/jeff-bezos-believes-aws-could-be-amazons-biggest-business/amp/). AMZN had 11x since then. Most people would start thinking: wow, is this peak performance? But no, they moved into AWS marketplace in 2012 to increase their market reach. Should've been able to find this in the ECs leading up to 2012.\n\nOther tell-tale signs could be that they are hiring aggressively (check via LinkedIn etc) - what roles are they hiring? Software engineers? What are the job descriptions? How does this match up to their growth plans as mentioned in the EC? How do they intend to use AWS as a SaaS product for its customers? How aggressive are they performing S&M from their financial statements? \n\nFast forward to the present, where AMZN's share price is roughly $3.4k, with a 2020 rev of $113b. Revenue for first 2 quarters of 2021 being $221b. What are their estimations going forward for the next 2 quarters? They've clearly made TWICE their 2020 rev within the first 6 months of 2021. Can they keep it up? What are their projections? What are they doing to reach this goal? \n\nAMZN plans to increase headcount by 150k for holiday shopping season, seems like e-commerce will most likely see a jump (https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/amazon-hire-150000-us-workers-holiday-shopping-season-2021-10-18/). FYI, they hired 100k workers for 2020 seasonal jobs. So surely this should mean something, but of course, I'd dig deeper to understand how they performed for the quarter with seasonal festivities. \n\nIn summary: follow their quarterly ECs, what are their growth plans and projections. Any new developments? Who are they hiring to front these new developments? Are these people capable and possess the relevant skill sets to execute? Did they manage to walk the talk? Was this reflected in their financial statements? The last thing you want is a fluff story and poor execution/ inability to deliver.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I see thank you for the advice.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.26587313413619995}], "tickers": ["amzn", "amzn"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Difficult to take money out to buy more stocks without falling into schoolboy error #1 Don\u2019t sell your winners. Your example would be a clear cut case of Why would you sell a winning stock to try and find another winning stock? The only time you would do this 8 when you have a winning stock that is outperforming for example takeover speculation makes a stock jump 40% in a week. Then you could justify selling out for the profit. Or if you perceive a bubble you might sell and plan to rebuy later when the stock pulls back like the tech bubble/pull back earlier this year.\n\nSo as to strategy you need to think long term until you feel confident to take a more risky investment approach such as day trading. Most people should never even consider that anyway. It\u2019s like trying to be a sports pro or famous musician, however good you are the odds are against you.\n\nLong term investing can be quite straightforward. Build a list of growth industries: electric vehicles, green energy, ai, robotics, semiconductors, online software tech, etc then build a list of to performers in each industry. Rule out any grossly overvalued companies, look for companies with a decent P/E ratio, profitable, well regarded by the various share advice firms. \n\nSetup a spreadsheet to show the result of various growth rates 5/10/15/20 % over the years between now and when you retire.\n\nDivide up your investment money and spread it between 15 - 20 stocks and watch and wait.\n\nAdd money when you can and adjust share holdings when you feel a companies situation has changed fundamentally.\n\nNever sell when the whole market is down. Don\u2019t sell a stock that goes down if you knew it was volatile when you bought it or you still believe in its long term future. Be patient and consistent and you will probably retire long before your friends.
