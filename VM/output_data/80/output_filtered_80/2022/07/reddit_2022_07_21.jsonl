Traders had expected a smaller hike of 25 basis points.\n\n\u201cThe Governing Council judged that it is appropriate to take a larger first step on its policy rate normalisation path than signalled at its previous meeting,\u201d the ECB said in a statement Thursday.\n\nThe Frankfurt institution had kept rates at historic lows, in negative territory since 2014, as it dealt with the region\u2019s sovereign debt crisis and the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe euro rose to a session high on news of the more aggressive rate hike, to trade at $1.0257. The yield on the 10-year Italian bond also jumped on the news, extending gains after reacting to the resignation of Prime Minister Mario Draghi earlier on Thursday.", "id": "w4i30b", "created_utc": 1658413694.0, "score": 419, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 83, "comments": [{"body": "AGGRESIVE 0% rates.

{"title": "There is a 30%-40% Chance We See a \"Black ---day\" Between July 27th and August 2nd. That's Next Week Suckas.", "selftext": "So what kind of coked out adderall overdose made me go bold with this prediction of imminent doom when the market has been doing uppies all week? It's pretty simple. Next Wednesday is FOMC where we're either going to get a .75bp rate hike, in which case the market does its usual rocket ship after the meeting, or we get a surprise 1.00bp hike and things probably tank after the meeting. Then on Thursday we have the Q2 GDP numbers come out confirming we're officially in a recession. (a fact I called last October btw, it just took a couple months for the data to catch up) The real action though is in the Thursday after hours Earnings Reports. Specifically, the ERs for two of the biggest companies on the planet, both of which I expect to fail spectacularly.\n\nApple and Amazon.\n\nJust in general I think both of these stocks are wildly overvalued (I have a fair price target of $20-25 on AMZN and $50 on AAPL) Amazon has a PE of 60, which is so absurd on multiple levels that I'm not even going to bother explaining why it's dumb. Apple has a PE of 25, which, again, is too high.\n\nI think both companies are going to get absolutely annihilated on ER, and when they do, they'll drag the entire market down with them. Now, why I am I so sure both companies will have bad ERs?\n\nFor Amazon, it's really easy, their current post Bezos leadership is actually a bunch of ferrets piled on top of each other in trenchcoats, they wildly overexpanded during the pandemic, and as people go outside again, they're not loading up on orders. Also, Prime Day was a bust, and AWS continues to no longer enjoy exclusive rights to the cloud services space as Microsoft, Google, IBM, and more expand into it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Current Amazon C-Suite](https://preview.redd.it/pnhvt5avduc91.jpg?width=202&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d05b98c07a8fc2cc1a5eba7ba2a12275fe2c681f)\n\nFor Apple, they're basically in the same situation as Amazon was last ER, where they had a complete dumpster fire of an ER previously, but papered over it with nonsense - in Apple's case that was refusing to provide guidance for their #1 market and home of 100% of their assemblies - China. If you haven't noticed, China ~~is currently approaching~~ [has reached](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlpC5OC0q_A) the \"tanks in the streets\" level of civil unrest and banking collapse due to the ponzi scheme real estate and infrastructure plan they've been running finally collapsing. (if you need a primer on why and how that's collapsing, see the DD \"One Company, Two Debts\" pinned to my profile from 10 months ago - I been like Burry level ahead of all this shit)\n\nSo, to recap, on 7/27, you're going to have a FED rate hike, then on 7/28 you're going to see headlines screaming about how we're officially in recession all day, then that night you'll see two of the biggest pillars of the market report dumpster fire earnings. Given all that, what do you think boomers and algos and momos are going to do Friday morning?\n\nSo I just scrapped my 21 year old pickup after the motor blew. I'm gonna spend $200 on this lotto play.

But if you need evidence of conviction, my house has a 30-year fixed 2% mortgage, and I'm currently selling it to go live in my buddies basement to try and front-run the real estate collapse - I'm probably too late, but we'll see!\n\n**TLDR: Black Friday next week (maybe, but maybe not, I'm only putting $200 on this)**\n\nAs far as an update on my food shortage play, I'm now up to 20 1/23 calls on W3AT and 5 11/18 calls on S0YB, I just keep buying that sweet dip.
