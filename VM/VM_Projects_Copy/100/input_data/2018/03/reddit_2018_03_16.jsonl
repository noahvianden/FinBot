{"title": "Could a 2008-like crash kill RH?", "selftext": "I think one of the problems is though that RH is waaaay too lax with their lending and advanced features. To get margin and options all you have to do is tell them you want them. So now you have traders with like $2000 plus $2000 margin in their accounts. If the market crashes, it's tough shit for the people who took out the loans because now they have margin calls. \n\nNormally I'd say thats not a problem because the fault lies on the trader. But when you have traders with $2000 to their name that just lost all their money plus $2000 of the brokers money, how is the broker supposed to get their money back? I seriously doubt someone with $2000 to their name will have the income to just drop another $2000 in to cover the margin call. Sure you could transfer  the debt to collections, but the problem still isn't solved until the debt is actually paid.\n\nYou saw how many RH accounts got destroy on the XIV implosion. That's only one security. If the whole market is falling like a rock, margin accounts will get killed left and right. Other brokers have made it through crashes before but they don't cater specifically to users with low funds/income that take high risks. That can lead to way more margin calls going unpaid, where RH takes a hit as well. Won't it hurt their business if they lend money that can't be paid back? How do other brokers handle this situation?\n\nTldr: Robinhood lends to users that may not be able to pay back margin calls in a complete crash. If they can't get their money back in a timely manner, can this hurt their sustainability as a broker?", "id": "84wq9h", "created_utc": 1521217719.0, "score": 97, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 101, "comments": [{"body": "If that happened, we'd have to change the name of this sub to Wall St Debts", "score": 68, "replies": [{"body": "Petition to assign you this flair ", "score": 45, "replies": [{"body": "+1 on this petition.", "score": 9, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "What about people wit $3000 in their account?
