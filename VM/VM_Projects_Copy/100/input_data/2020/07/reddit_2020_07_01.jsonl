The Battery manufacturing lines there are owned by Panasonic. \n\nHowever, the 2170 cells being made by Panasonic in Nevada are not the \"next generation\" battery being referred to here. All the technology expected to be unveiled at Battery Day in September is owned solely by Tesla. \n\n1) Tesla acquired a small super-capacitor company called Maxwell Technologies last year, because a breakthrough manufacturing technique (Dry Battery Electrode \"DBE\") developed by Maxwell for super-capacitors was theorized by Maxwell and proven by Tesla (at their Halifax Battery lab run by Jeff Dahn) to be applicable in the manufacture of lithium ion batteries, significantly lowering the cost and complexity of manufacturing by removing corrosive wet solvents from the process while also improving the energy density and life cycle.  \n\n2) At the same time, Tesla was working with another tiny company in Colorado called Sil-ion that had developed a means of using silicon in the battery cells to improve their lifespan and power density significantly, but didn't know how to manufacture the cells. These cells were being tested at the same lab in Halifax as the Maxwell process above, and there was a presentation made last fall by a researcher from the lab that briefly mentioned that the Sil-ion cell design was manufacturable using the Maxwell DBE process.  Tesla acquired Sil-ion quietly at some point in the last year. \n\n3) Tesla filed a patent for a novel cell package last year (granted this spring, look up \"tabless electrode\") which changes how cylindrical cells are manufactured to significantly decrease the amount of heat generated during use ( improving cycle life) and decreases the cost of manufacture. Right after they filed this patent, Tesla purchased a Canadian company, Hibar Systems... one of the world leaders in cylindrical battery cell manufacturing technologies. \n\nAll of these technologies individually represent huge breakthroughs in the cost and capabilities of lithium ion batteries. Combined, even if they compound diminishingly, they represent a battery product that immediately obsoletes everything else on the market, if Tesla can bring it to market.

Not too mention where will you get this hydrogen from? Right now there is two choices, oil or water. I shouldn't have to stress why getting hydrogen from water is a bad idea. We already have water scarcity, as we use our water for drinking and growing crops. We do not need to have fuel taking up water that barely meets our food and drinking needs. That would be a catastrophe. Same goes for biofuels, they need massive croplands to be cleared and massive amount of water which deplete the aquifers faster than they can recharge.

These items increase in difficulty the more you scale up.

I see Tesla as an energy company. They went after transportation because it is one of the largest energy usage. But as they grow and expand battery and energy capacity, their ability to get into other markets that use an intense amount of energy will also follow. Think about this, oil and energy stocks used to be the largest valued companies in the world. Now they aren't even close however the value of energy is still worth trillions and is still growing. Somebody will fill that gap and currently, I see that gap being filled by mainly Tesla. I think that is why this stock is growing and will be worth more. Not to say that this stock will continue be volatile, but if you look back in 10 years, I'm sure it will be a lot worth more than today", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "It's all on what they can achieve I guess.

In that sense, the inclusion can be priced in.\n\nFor example, if 5 ppl bid on an art auction but they all know that every time 1000 more ppl show up in the last hour, and they know historically from auctions always being run this way that this always causes a flat 20% jump in the final selling price, you could get a behavior where those 5 bidders will bid up to their price plus the expected 20% premium so that when the 1000 ppl roll in, those 1005 ppl then see a perfectly fair price and no new bids come in after they all roll in.\n\nNot a perfect analogy since the new buying has to happen no matter what whereas in the analogy bids can disappear, but hopefully you see my point.\n\n\nAnother simple way of thinking about it is if a hurricane is coming and may or may not disrupt the production of a natural resource, the price of that resource will go up a big to account for the risk of said hurricane.  So a hurricane that isn't even real yet that no one knows will even have a real effect on that natural resource can still affect the price of it.

Tesla announces its profit, s&p inclusion is guaranteed, and the market drives the stock price up to $1500 well before the actual official date of inclusion.  Well, then what happens on the day of inclusion when millions of buy orders come in?  Does the price go to $1700?  That makes no sense, because we established that that all that flurry of future buying was already priced in and already drove the stock to $1500.\n\nMy best guess was my first theory - that the pricing in can fully occur because the regular buyers drive it up to $1500 but not enough buyers are left at that high price point to keep it at $1500... That is, of course, until the index fund trackers come in and prop it up at $1500 but not a dollar higher.

So assuming you bought 1 contract (where 1 contract is 100 shares) priced at $1240 and the stock closes at $1240.01.  Then you will be sold 100 shares priced at $1240.  You will now owe your broker $124,000 for those shares.  You can quickly sell these to cover any margin.  However if the stock goes down the next day, you still own $124,000 and have less than that in value of stock.\n2. Options are priced towards IV (implied volatility).  So a highly volatile stock has a higher premium to buy that option.  It also means that if a stock is flat, you lose value in your options (IV crush).  In general, don't hold stocks til expiration unless you intended to buy the shares.\n3.
